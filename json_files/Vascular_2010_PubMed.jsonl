Endoscopic skull base reconstructive options and limitations.", "abstract": "As endoscopic skull base resections have advanced, appropriate reconstruction has become paramount. The reconstructive options for the skull base include both avascular and vascular grafts. We review these and provide an algorithm for endoscopic skull base reconstruction. One hundred and sixty-six skull base dural defects, reconstructed with an endonasal vascular flap, were examined. As an adjunct, avascular reconstruction techniques are discussed to illustrate all options for endonasal skull base reconstruction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates are also discussed. Small CSF leaks may be successfully repaired with various avascular grafting techniques. Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) to the skull base often have larger dural defects with high-flow CSF leaks. Success rates for some EEA procedures utilizing avascular grafts approach 90%, yet in high-flow leak situations, success rates are much lower (50 to 70%). Defect location and complexity guides vascularized flap choice. When nasoseptal flaps are unavailable, anterior/sellar defects are best managed with an endoscopically harvested pericranial flap, whereas clival/posterior defects may be reconstructed with an inferior turbinate or temporoparietal flap.

However, the fabrication of complex engineered tissues has been hampered due to the lack of vascularization to provide sufficient blood supply after implantation. In this article, we propose using rapid prototyping technology to prefabricate a scaffold with an inside hollowed vascular system including an arterial end, a venous end and capillary networks between them. The scaffold will be ''printed'' layer by layer. When printing every layer, a ''low-melting point'' material will be used to form a blood vessel network and a tissue-specific material will be used outside it. Hereafter the 'low-melting point' material will be evacuated by vaporization to ensure a hollowed vessel network. Then the inside hollowed capillary network can be endothelialized by using autologous endothelial cells in a cycling bioreactor while the outside material can be embedded with tissue-special cells. In the end, the new vascularized autologous grafts could be transferred to the defect site by using microsurgical techniques to connect the grafts with the host artery and vein.

Human outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) isolated from the mononuclear cell fraction of peripheral blood represent a potent population of circulating endothelial progenitors that could provide a cell source for rapid anastomosis and scaffold vascularization. Our previous work with these cells in co-culture with primary human osteoblasts has demonstrated their potential to form perfused vascular structures within a starch-poly(caprolactone) biomaterial in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of OECs to form perfused vascular structures as early as 48 h following subcutaneous implantation of the biomaterial in vivo. The number of OEC-derived vessels increased throughout the study, an effect that was independent of the OEC donor. This finding of rapid and thorough OEC-mediated scaffold vascularization demonstrates the great potential for OEC-based strategies to promote vascularization in tissue engineering. OECs have the potential to contribute to host-derived scaffold vascularization, and formed vascular structures at a similar density as those arising from the host. Additionally, immunohistochemical evidence demonstrated the close interaction between OECs and the co-cultured osteoblasts. In addition to the known paracrine activity osteoblasts have in modulating angiogenesis of co-cultured OECs, we demonstrate the potential of osteoblasts to provide additional structural support for OEC-derived vessels, perhaps acting in a pericyte-like role.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-05-24", "authors": ["ShahramGhanaati", "SabineFuchs", "Matthew JWebber", "CarinaOrth", "MikeBarbeck", "Manuela EGomes", "Rui LReis", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1002/term.373"}

{"title": "Multifactorial nature of tumor drug resistance.", "abstract": "Tumor drug resistance (TDR) remains a major obstacle for successful treatment of cancer. Till ninetieth years of past century, resistance of tumors to anticancer drugs was most often ascribed to gene mutations, gene amplification, or epigenetic changes that influence the uptake, metabolism or export of drugs from single cells. Meanwhile it became apparent that TDR was formed at the different level of tumor biological structure: in addition to intracellular mechanisms, interactions of cancer cells (multicellular mechanisms) as well as solid tumor microenvironment (including tumor vascularization, components of extracellular matrix and connective tissue) played an important role in protecting cancer cells from initial drug exposure. The limited ability of cancer drugs to penetrate tumor tissue and to reach tumor cells in a potentially lethal concentration makes a significant contribution to low efficacy of cancer therapy and is often resumed as an occurrence of TDR. Failure to recognize such clinical drug resistance cannot be explained entirely by mechanisms operative at the level of the single cell may lead to disappointing results in clinical trials. Presented data demonstrate a multifactorial nature of TDR. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics aspects of TDR mechanisms are analyzed. The methods to overcome TDR and to increase the efficacy of cancer therapy are discussed.", "journal": "Experimental oncology", "date": "2011-03-16", "authors": ["G ISolyanik"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Vascular targeting therapy: potential benefit depends on tumor and host related effects.", "abstract": "The growth and development of most solid tumors require that they form their own functional vascular supply, which they do from the host normal vascular network by the process of angiogenesis. The significance of this neo-vasculature makes it an excellent target and two forms of vascular targeting agents (VTAs) have evolved; those that inhibit the angiogenesis process (angiogenesis inhibitors, AIs) and those that damage the already established vessels (vascular disrupting agents, VDAs). Although both AIs and VDAs can have substantial anti-tumor activity, neither induce tumor control, thus for their full clinical potential to be achieved they will need to be combined with more conventional cancer therapies. Numerous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of combining AIs and VDAs with radio- and chemo-therapy and many of these approaches are now under clinical evaluation. Although the tumor is the target for VTA therapy the normal host cells play an important role in VTA efficacy. Host cells such as infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, platelets, endothelial cells, and stromal fibroblasts can all produce the important growth factors that initiate angiogenesis. Many of these host cells also actively participate in the physical steps of angiogenesis including destabilization of existing vessels, blood vessel sprouting, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and vessel stabilization. There is some evidence that these host cells can also influence VTA treatment, either by helping to normalize tumor vessels when AIs are administered or stimulate tumor angiogenesis after treatment with VDAs. The host itself also plays a critical role. Cancer patients undergoing therapy are normally treated to tolerance, thus the normal tissue side effects actually control the effective dose given to the tumor. All VTAs currently in clinical development induce some form of systemic side effects, which range from being rather mild and tolerable to more severe and even life threatening. For more localised therapies there is also the issue of possible VTA-enhanced local tissue reactions. A few pre-clinical studies have investigated this with radiation, but failed to show any enhancement of radiation-induced normal tissue damage by VTAs. Clearly, the therapeutic benefit of VTA treatment will depend on a balance between tumor and host related effects, and in this review we will consider the contribution of each.", "journal": "Experimental oncology", "date": "2011-03-16", "authors": ["M RHorsman", "A BBohn", "MBusk"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Femoral head osteonecrosis: why choose free vascularized fibula grafting.", "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a disease in which bone death occurs and usually progresses to articular incongruity and subsequent osteoarthritis. To delay the process of the disease and the conversion to total hip arthroplasty, many surgical techniques have been described. Core decompression, nonvascularized autologous bone grafts, porous tantalum implant procedure, and various osteotomies have been used for the management of early precollapse stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. However, none of these procedures is neither entirely effective nor can obtain predictable results. With the progress of microsurgery, the implantation of a free vascularized fibula graft to the necrotic femoral head has provided the most consistently successful results. Although the procedure is technically demanding, there is growing recognition that the use of free vascularized fibula graft may improve patient quality of life by functional improvement and pain alleviation. The success of the procedure is related to decompression of the femoral head, excision of the necrotic bone, and addition of cancellous bone graft with osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, which augments revascularization and neoosteogenesis of the femoral head. Free vascularized fibula graft, especially in younger patients, is a salvaging procedure of the necrotic femoral head in early precollapse stages. In postcollapse osteonecrosis, the procedure appears to delay the need for total hip arthroplasty in the majority of patients.

Growth factors may promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. In the present study, we searched the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) loaded polypropylene meshes in an incisional hernia model in rats.\nA total of 80 Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups. A uniform surgical procedure was employed in all groups: a 5 cm skin incision was made at the midline and a full segment of the abdominal wall sized 3 x 2 cm was excised. Abdominal wall was closed with rapidly absorbable 3/0 catgut. Following this standard surgery, five different procedures were applied to the groups before closing the skin with 4/0 monofilament polypropylene sutures. Control subjects (Group 1) received no extra procedure after abdominal wall suturing. Polypropylene meshes were used in onlay position by fixing 4/0 monofimalent polypropylene interrupted sutures in other four groups. A standard mesh with no chemical treatment was used in Group 2. Gelatin coated meshes were used in Group 3, while Group 4 and 5 received bFGF loaded meshes with 1 microgram (microg) and 5 microg doses respectively. All the groups then divided into 1st month (early: E) and 2nd month (late: L) subgroups (n=8 each) according to sacrification dates. Tensiometric and histopathological evaluations were done. The specimens for histopathology were obtained from the interface area of the meshes and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and also Masson trichrome. The variables were examined and evaluated by a single blinded pathologist under light microscopy in respect of inflammation, vascularization, fibroblast activity, collagen fibers and connective tissue organization. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase method was performed using the primary monooclonal antibodies against collagen type I and collagen Type III.\nbFGF loaded meshes showed higher tensile strength values in comparison with a standard polypropylene mesh after 2 months.

A literature review on the topic of vascular supply in JNA was performed.\nThe first patient's preoperative angiogram demonstrated only right-sided blood supply. However, significant bleeding was encountered, and an intraoperative angiogram showed significant new vascularization from the left ascending pharyngeal artery (APA), which was embolized. The surgery was completed successfully without further significant hemorrhage after converting to an open approach. Preoperative angiograms from the next three patients demonstrated bilateral vascular supply. Embolization and endoscopic resection was successful in these cases.

Patella infera may ensue. In this study we unilaterally resected the central one-third of the PT in 20 sheep, without reconstructing or defunctionalizing the native ACL, and examined the effects at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively on PT length, histological appearance of the donor defect and in vitro stifle joint kinematics. Mean length increases (p > 0.263) in the operated tendons of 0.3%, 2.8%, 0.5%, and 2.4% were observed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. A significant proximal shift of the patella correlated well with a mean 2.35\u00b0 retardation of patellar flexion (r = 0.440, p = 0.001). A mean net 4.9\u00b0 decrease in medial patellar tilt was also observed (p < 0.001), but was not coupled with changes in tibial rotation. Donor defect tissue showed a distinct progression of healing with time, remodeling from dense scar tissue at 3 weeks to bundles of well-organized collagen enveloped by vascularized loose connective tissue at 24 weeks but was not associated with the restoration of kinematics. These results suggest that resection of the central one-third of the PT and leaving the defect open in the ovine stifle joint may be associated with increased PT length and changes in patellar kinematics which do not recover 6 months postoperatively.

This physical characteristic, together with the highly variable vessel shapes and surfaces, leads to considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the delivery of oxygen, nutrients and drugs, and the removal of metabolites. Although these biological features have now been well established, quantitative analyses of neovascularity in two-dimensional histological sections still fail to view tumor architecture in non-Euclidean terms, and this leads to errors in visually interpreting the same tumor, and discordant results from different laboratories. A review of the literature concerning the application of microvessel density (MVD) estimates, an Euclidean-based approach used to quantify vascularity in normal and neoplastic pituitary tissues, revealed some disagreements in the results and led us to discuss the limitations of the Euclidean quantification of vascularity. Consequently, we introduced fractal geometry as a better means of quantifying the microvasculature of normal pituitary glands and pituitary adenomas, and found that the use of the surface fractal dimension is more appropriate than MVD for analysing the vascular network of both. We propose extending the application of this model to the analysis of the angiogenesis and angioarchitecture of brain tumors.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgical sciences", "date": "2011-02-15", "authors": ["ADi Ieva", "FGrizzi", "GCeva-Grimaldi", "EAimar", "SSerra", "PPisano", "MLorenzetti", "FTancioni", "PGaetani", "FCrotti", "MTschabitscher", "CMatula", "RRodriguez Y Baena"], "doi": null}

Toluidine blue staining was used to identify mast cells in blocks containing the central portion of the neoplasm.\nA concentration of between 0 and 10 mast cells was found in one single case of SCC of the skin and there were no cases of SCC of the mouth with concentrations of mast cells in the tumor >201. In the majority of cases of SCC of the mouth (47%; n=16), mast cell concentration was between 0 and 10, with a concentration >51 mast cells in 80% of cases of SCC of the skin. All the cases of SCC of the mouth with a concentration of mast cells between 100 and 200 and 80% of those with a concentration of 51-99 were located on the lip.

To achieve this, the scaffold must have a suitable interconnected pore network and be made of an osteogenic material. Bioactive glass is an ideal material because it rapidly bonds to bone and degrades over time, releasing soluble silica and calcium ions that are thought to stimulate osteoprogenitor cells. Melt-derived bioactive glasses, such as the original Bioglass composition, are available commercially, but porous scaffolds have been difficult to produce because Bioglass and similar compositions crystallize on sintering. Sol-gel foam scaffolds have been developed that avoid this problem. They have a hierarchical pore structure comprising interconnected macropores, with interconnect diameters in excess of the 100 microm that is thought to be needed for vascularized bone ingrowth, and an inherent nanoporosity of interconnected mesopores (2-50 nm) which is beneficial for the attachment of osteoprogenitor cells. They also have a compressive strength in the range of cancellous bone.

{"title": "Water channels in peritoneal dialysis.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis involves diffusive and convective transports and osmosis through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) corresponds to the ultrasmall pore predicted by the modelization of peritoneal transport. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that up-regulation of the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries is reflected by increased water permeability and ultrafiltration, without affecting the osmotic gradient and the permeability for small solutes. Inversely, studies in Aqp1 mice have shown that haploinsufficiency in AQP1 is reflected by significant attenuation of water transport. Recent studies have identified lead compounds that could act as agonists of aquaporins, as well as putative binding sites and potential mechanisms of gating the water channel. By modulating water transport, these pharmacological agents could have clinically relevant effects in targeting specific tissues or disease states.

Different methods of adhesion prevention have been developed, including coated meshes and separate antiadhesive barriers (SABs). In this study one type of mesh was tested with different SABs, which were fixed to the sutured mesh using fibrin sealant. The primary aim was to compare adhesion prevention between different SABs. Secondary aims were the assessment of tissue integration and evaluation of SAB fixation with fibrin sealant.\nThirty-two rats were randomized to one of three treatment groups (SurgiWrap, Prevadh and Seprafilm) or a control group (no SAB). Animals were operated on with an open IPOM technique (8 per group). One macroporous polypropylene mesh per animal (2 \u00d7 2 cm) was fixed with four non-absorbable sutures. An antiadhesive barrier of 2\u00b75 \u00d7 2\u00b75 cm was fixed with fibrin sealant. After 30 days, adhesion formation, tissue integration, seroma formation, inflammation and vascularization were evaluated macroscopically and by histology.\nPrevadh and Seprafilm groups showed a significant reduction in adhesion formation compared with the control group. Tissue integration of the mesh was reduced in these groups. Fibrin sealant fixed the SAB to the mesh securely in all groups.\nPrevadh and Seprafilm are potent materials for the reduction of adhesion formation.

Animals were treated with either celecoxib or radiation (7 Gy single photon dose) alone or a combination of celecoxib and radiation, respectively. Untreated animals served as controls. The impact of radiation and COX-2 inhibition on angiogenesis, microcirculation, and tumor growth was analyzed over 28 days by means of intravital microscopy and histological methods.\nMonotherapies with radiation as well as celecoxib had significant antitumor effects compared to untreated controls.

{"title": "Association of mast cells with calcification in the human pineal gland.", "abstract": "Increased pineal calcifications and decreased pineal melatonin biosynthesis, both age related, support the notion of a pineal bio-organic timing mechanism. The role of calcification in the pathogenesis of pineal gland dysfunction remains unknown but the available data document that calcification is an organized, regulated process, rather than a passive aging phenomenon. The cellular biology and micro-environmental conditions required for calcification remain poorly understood but most studies have demonstrated evidence that mast cells are strongly implicated in this process. The aim of the present study was to examine the phenotype of mast cells associated with early stages and with the progressive development of calcification in the human pineal gland. The study was performed on pineal samples of 170 fetuses and children whose brains were autopsied and diagnosed during 1998-2002. The representative cerebral and pineal specimens were stained with haematoxylin and eosin or the von Kossa staining technique and for the distribution of mast cell tryptase, mast cell chymase, histamine H4 receptor and vascular network using biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin. Tryptase mast cells were found in all stages of pineal gland development independently of the presence of local tissue lesions. All of them were always localized in the close vicinity of the blood vessels and expressed immunoreactivity to histamine H4 receptor antibody. Immunolocalization of mast cells by chymase antibody (and following dual immunostaining with both chymase and tryptase antibodies) demonstrated that these cells were few in number and were located in the subcapsular region of the gland. In our study, all functional mast cells that underwent activation and were co-localized with deposits of calcium did not contain chymase. All of them were stained with tryptase and represent the MC-T phenotype. Tryptase mast cells and extracellular tryptase were often associated with areas of early and more advanced stages of calcification. Our results lead to the conclusion that the tryptase mast cells play a major role in the pineal calcification process as sites where this process starts and as a source of production of numerous biologically active substances including tryptase that participate in calcification.", "journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "date": "2011-01-13", "authors": ["DanutaMa\u015bli\u0144ska", "MilenaLaure-Kamionowska", "KrzysztofDer\u0119gowski", "S\u0142awomirMa\u015bli\u0144ski"], "doi": null}

The numbers of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2-positive EPCs in blood and hematopoietic organs of additional endometriotic and control mice were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that approximately 15% of the microvascular endothelium in engrafting endometriotic lesions consisted of incorporated GFP-positive EPCs. Recruitment of EPCs into the lesions coincided with the establishment of own blood supply and the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1. Accordingly, treatment with the stromal cell-derived factor-1/chemokine receptor type 4 axis antagonist AMD3100 significantly decreased the number of recruited EPCs and the vascularization of endometriotic lesions. However, endometriosis did not induce increased levels of EPCs in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen of C57BL/6 mice.

The effect of F/P MP-F on the survival, granulation, and capillary formation in fat grafts was histologically compared with control grafts containing either FGF-2, F/P MPs or PBS. The control fat grafts became attached to tissues adjacent to the implantation site and were significantly resorbed after 30 days.

Normal adipocytes were obviously decreased in the control groups with increased granulation tissues, whereas normal adipocytes with capillary formations were maintained in the F/P MP-F group.

We found that purified adipose stem cells express high level of CD49d, CD44, CD90, CD105, CD13, and CD71 and these markers of staminality were maintained at high level for at least 3 months and seven passages of in vitro culture. As expected, these cells resulted negative for the endothelial and hematopoietic-specific markers CD31, CD106, CD34, and CD45. Differentiation towards adipogenic lineage demonstrated that purified adipose-derived stem cells are still able to become adipocytes at least 3 months after in vitro culture. The analysis of Akt and MAPK phosphorylation confirmed a modulation of their activity during differentiation. Interestingly, we established for the first time that, among the p53 family members, a strong upregulation of p63 expression occurs in adipocytic differentiation, indicating a role for this transcription factor in adipocytic differentiation. Taken together, these data indicate that purified lipoaspirate-derived stem cells maintain their characteristic of staminality for a long period of in vitro culture, suggesting that they could be applied for cell-based therapy to improve autologous lipoaspirate transplant.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2011-01-07", "authors": ["ValentinaFolgiero", "EmiliaMigliano", "MarinellaTedesco", "StefanoIacovelli", "GiuliaBon", "Maria LuisaTorre", "AdaSacchi", "MarioMarazzi", "StefaniaBucher", "RitaFalcioni"], "doi": "10.3727/09638910X519265"}

The goal of our study was to verify the validity of these features and to identify a typical sonoelastographic pattern for pleomorphic adenomas.\nBetween April 2007 and February 2010, 70 salivary gland masses were examined prospectively (58 in the parotid gland, 12 in the submandibular gland). The following features were targeted: size, limits, contour, structure, echogenicity, vascularization, elasticity/stiffness.\nOf the 70 tumors, 32 (45.7%) were pleomorphic adenomas, 12 (17.1%) Warthin tumors, 9 (12.8%) other benign tumors, 13 (18.5%) primary malignant tumors, 3 metastases from carcinoma, and 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among pleomorphic adenomas, 15 (46.9%) were inhomogeneous, 7 (21.9%) contained necrotic areas and 14 (43.7%) were well-vascularized. The lobulated contour was identified in 14 pleomorphic adenomas (43.7%), no other benign tumor presented this type of contour, but it was identified in 2 malignant tumors (15.3%). On sonoelastography, most pleomorphic adenomas were heterogeneous. The elastic component represented more than 50% of the tumor tissue in 22 cases (68.7%). This aspect was also identified for 6 malignant tumors (46.1%).\nOur results demonstrate that features such as heterogeneous structure, rich vascularization and intra-tumoral necrosis may be identified in a significant number of pleomorphic adenomas. The most specific element in our group was the presence of a lobulated contour, which was not seen in any other benign tumor, but may rarely appear in certain malignant tumors. The elastographic aspect was heterogeneous for most tumors, but the elastic composition identified in most pleomorphic adenomas was also present in a significant proportion of malignant tumors.

The high load of commensal bacteria in the small intestine may contribute through activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. In this study, we examine the participation of TLR4 in acute allograft rejection in an orthotopic mouse model of SIT.\nWild-type C57Bl/6 (H-2b) or TLR49(-/-) (H-2b) mice were transplanted with syngeneic (C57Bl/6), allogeneic (BALB/c; H-2d), or F1 (BALB/cxC57Bl/6; H-2d/b) vascularized, orthotopic small intestine grafts. Graft recipients were killed on days 2 to 6 posttransplant. Serum cytokines were measured by Luminex, and tissue was obtained for histology and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nBALB/c grafts transplanted into C57Bl/6 recipients exhibited mixed inflammatory infiltrates, destruction of the mucosa, and significant apoptosis. TLR2 and TLR4 transcripts were modestly increased in syngeneic grafts on days 2 and 6 compared with native bowel, whereas TLR2 and TLR4 were significantly increased on days 2 and 6 in allogeneic grafts. Although fully mismatched and F1 grafts were rejected by C57Bl/6 recipients (mean survival time=8.2 and 9.3 days, respectively), graft survival was significantly prolonged in TLR4(-/-) recipients (mean survival time=10.6 and 14.3 days, respectively). Proinflammatory cytokines were markedly reduced in TLR4(-/-) graft recipients.\nSmall intestine graft survival is prolonged in the absence of TLR4, suggesting that gut flora associated with the graft may augment alloimmune responses through TLR4.

We investigated AC clearance, also termed efferocytosis, during post-lactational remodeling, using mice deficient for MerTK, Axl, and Tyro3, three related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulating macrophage-mediated efferocytosis in monocytes. MerTK expression, apoptosis and the accumulation of apoptotic debris were examined in histological sections of MerTK-deficient, Axl/Tyro3-deficient, and wild-type mammary glands harvested at specific time points during lactation and synchronized involution. The ability of primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to engulf ACs was assessed in culture. Transplant of MerTK-deficient mammary epithelium into cleared WT mammary fat pads was used to assess the contribution of WT mammary macrophages to post-lactational efferocytosis.\nACs induced MerTK expression in MECs, resulting in elevated MerTK levels at the earliest stages of involution. Loss of MerTK resulted in AC accumulation in post-lactational MerTK-deficient mammary glands, but not in Axl and Tyro3-deficient mammary glands. Increased vascularization, fibrosis, and epithelial hyperproliferation were observed in MerTK-deficient mammary glands through at least 60 days post-weaning, due to failed efferocytosis after lactation, but did not manifest in nulliparous mice. WT host-derived macrophages failed to rescue efferocytosis in transplanted MerTK-deficient mammary epithelium.\nEfferocytosis by MECs through MerTK is crucial for mammary gland homeostasis and function during the post-lactational period.

In our experience, some patients suffer from permanent hypocalcemia and related symptoms despite normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) values after thyroid surgery. The aim of this work was to present a series of such patients with long-term hypocalcemia and normal PTH values to evaluate to what extent parathyroid function was impaired by thyroidectomy, and determine whether irregularities of bone and calcium metabolism were associated with this phenomenon.\nWe present a series of eight patients with normal PTH and subnormal calcium levels at follow-up 2 months after thyroid surgery. Outcome parameters were intra- and postoperative PTH and calcium kinetics, and the following markers of calcium and bone metabolism at long-term follow-up: serum calcium, total serum albumin, ionized calcium, magnesium, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, urinary calcium, urinary creatinine, osteocalcin, c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and alkaline phosphatase.\nAll patients had normal calcium and PTH levels at the start of the operation. The intraoperative decline in PTH was >90%; the trough (3.3% of preoperative value) was reached 3 hours after surgery. Patients underwent complete determination of bone metabolism parameters during long-term follow-up 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 months after surgery.

In the remaining five patients, only isolated abnormalities in bone and calcium metabolism parameters were found (i.e., alterations in urinary calcium, thyrotropin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, and c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen).\nAn intraoperative injury to the parathyroid glands or their vascularization is the likely contributing factor to the development of permanent hypocalcemia with normal PTH values after thyroid surgery. The remaining parathyroid tissue is subject to a maximum stimulus by hypocalcemia and, therefore, is able to maintain PTH values in the normal range.

Likewise, TGF-\u03b2 was shown to up-regulate paxillin expression through a process that was PP-1 dependent. The interplay between PP-1 and TGF-\u03b2 was further observed by the induction of cell rounding and the loss of paxillin-actin co precipitations upon PP-1 inhibition and the compensation for these effects by TGF-\u03b2. Studies initiated to determine how PP-1 might regulate motility showed its role in maintaining cytoskeletal organization and its capacity to directly dephosphorylate the focal adhesion scaffolding protein paxillin.

All types of stimulus produce cutaneous signs in the hands, notably cold, light, pressure, contact, etc. Exposure to light makes it the region where photodermatosis is expressed, but also a particular site for cutaneous carcinogenesis. The countless chemical substances that the hand encounters can create specific or particular diseases in this location (irritative dermitis, contact eczema, hyperkeratosis, atrophy, etc.). The hand is also the site of infectious dermatosis transmission (erysipeloid, orf, mycobacteriosis, etc.), sometimes exotic (chromomycosis, histoplasmosis), and the site of plant penetration (protothecosis or more commonly thorns and splinters). The complexity of its vascularization and its many bones, joints, and tendons explain why it is a preferred area for signs of systemic diseases (diverse forms of lupus, dermatomyositis, inflammatory rheumatism, etc.).

{"title": "An essential role of the cysteine-rich domain of FZD4 in Norrin/Wnt signaling and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.", "abstract": "The Wnt pathway plays important yet diverse roles in health and disease. Mutations in the Wnt receptor FZD4 gene have been confirmed to cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). FEVR is characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina, which can lead to vitreous bleeding, tractional retinal detachment, and blindness. We screened for mutations in the FZD4 gene in five families with FEVR and identified five mutations (C45Y, Y58C, W226X, C204R, and W496X), including three novel mutations (C45Y, Y58C, and W226X). In the retina, Norrin serves as a ligand and binds to FZD4 to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in normal angiogenesis and vascularization. The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD4 has been shown to play a critical role in Norrin-FZD4 binding. We investigated the effect of mutations in the FZD4 CRD in Norrin binding and signaling in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type and mutant FZD4 proteins were assayed for Norrin binding and Norrin-dependent activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by cell-surface and overlay binding assays and luciferase reporter assays. In HEK293 transfection studies, C45Y, Y58C, and C204R mutants did not bind to Norrin and failed to transduce FZD4-mediated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. In vivo studies using Xenopus embryos showed that these FZD4 mutations disrupt Norrin/\u03b2-catenin signaling as evidenced by decreased Siamois and Xnr3 expression.

As mediators of ERK1/2-dependent GC differentiation, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, (C/EBP)\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2, were also disrupted. Female Cebpb(gc)(-/-) mutant mice, but not Cebpa(gc)(-/-) mice, were subfertile whereas Cebpa/b(gc)(-/-) double-mutant females were sterile. Follicles failed to ovulate, ovaries were devoid of corpora lutea, luteal cell marker genes (Lhcgr, Prlr, Ptgfr, Cyp11a1, and Star) were absent, and serum progesterone levels were low. Microarray analyses identified numerous C/EBP\u03b1/\u03b2 target genes in equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-human (h)CG-treated mice. At 4 h post-hCG, a subset (19%) of genes altered in the Cebpa/b-depleted cells was also altered in ERK1/2-depleted cells; hence they are common effectors of ERK1/2. Additional genes down-regulated in the Cebpa/b-depleted cells at 8 and 24 h post-hCG include known (Akr1b7, Runx2, Star, Saa3) and novel (Abcb1b, Apln, Igfbp4, Prlr, Ptgfr Timp4) C/EBP targets and effectors of luteal and vascular cell development. Bhmt, a gene controlling methionine metabolism and thought to be expressed exclusively in liver and kidney, was high in wild-type luteal cells but totally absent in Cebpa/b mutant cells. Because numerous genes potentially associated with vascular development were suppressed in the mutant cells, C/EBP\u03b1/\u03b2 appear to dictate the luteinization process by also controlling genes that regulate the formation of the extensive vascular network required to sustain luteal cells.

In this species, the pecten consisted of 24-25 highly vascularized pleats held together apically by a heavily pigmented 'bridge' and projected freely into the vitreous body in the ventral part of the eye cup. Ascending and descending blood vessels of varying caliber, together with a profuse network of capillaries, essentially constituted the vascular framework of the pecten. A distinct distribution of melanosomes was discernible on the pecten, the concentration being highest at its apical end, moderate at the crest of the pleats and lowest at the basal and lateral margins. Overlying and within the vascular network, a close association between blood vessels and melanocytes was evident. It is conjectured that such an association may have evolved to augment the structural reinforcement of this nutritive organ in order to keep it firmly erectile within the gel-like vitreous.

Endothelial cell migration into XY gonads initiates testis morphogenesis. However, neither the signals that regulate vascularization of the gonad nor the mechanisms through which vessels affect tissue morphogenesis are known. Here, we show that Vegf signaling is required for gonad vascularization and cord morphogenesis. We establish that interstitial cells express Vegfa and respond, by proliferation, to endothelial migration. In the absence of vasculature, four-dimensional imaging of whole organs revealed that interstitial proliferation is reduced and prevents formation of wedge-like structures that partition the gonad into cord-forming domains. Antagonizing vessel maturation also reduced proliferation. However, proliferation of mesenchymal cells was rescued by the addition of PDGF-BB.

To test the hypothesis that temporary inhibition of Wnt signaling will enhance granulation tissue and promote angiogenesis in tissue repair, we employed a recently characterized small molecule Wnt inhibitor. Pyrvinium is an FDA-approved drug that we identified as a Wnt inhibitor in a chemical screen for small molecules that stabilize \u03b2-catenin and inhibit Axin degradation. Our subsequent characterization of pyrvinium has revealed that its critical cellular target in the Wnt pathway is Casein Kinase 1\u03b1. Daily administration of pyrvinium directly into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponges implanted subcutaneously in mice generated better organized and vascularized granulation tissue; this compound also increased the proliferative index of the tissue within the sponges. To evaluate its effect in myocardial repair, we induced a myocardial infarction (MI) by coronary artery ligation and administered a single intramyocardial dose of pyrvinium. Mice were evaluated by echocardiography at 7 and 30 days post-MI and treatment; post mortem hearts were evaluated by histology at 30 days. Pyrvinium reduced adverse cardiac remodeling demonstrated by decreased left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD) as compared to a control compound.

{"title": "Preoperative imaging study of the spinal cord vascularization: interest and limits in spine resection for primary tumors.", "abstract": "The necessicity to localize the anterior spinal arteries before anterior approach of the spine stays controversial by orthopaedic surgeons. On the other hand the surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurisms routinely sacrifices many segmental arteries pairs without spinal arteries localization. This, associated with spinal cord protection, results to few neurological complication. However, during vertebrectomies, the roots ligation completely interrupts the spinal cord blood supply at this level. In our experience the spinal arteries localization was systematically done before ninety-eight spine resections. In five cases an anterior radiculomedullary artery was ligated (four anterior radiculomedullary and one great anterior radiculomedullary arteries) without neurological complication, in two cases of extended resection (more than four levels) a neurological complication occurred. No spinal artery was identified at the resection level and the neurological complications were resolutive and did not seem related to definitive vascular problem. These accomplishments lead to discuss the importance of spinal arteries localization and preservation in this surgery. The discovery of an anterior radiculomedullary artery is not a contraindication to en-bloc vertebrectomy at this level, nevertheless in the case of great anterior radiculomedullary artery (Adamkiewicz) the surgical indication must be seriously debated. In fact, this case and those where multilevel resections (more than three levels) are indicated seem the most dangerous situations and the use of the different means of spinal cord protection could be indicated to decrease neurological risk.

Increased neovascularization has been detected in ruptured human lesions and is associated with clinical manifestations of plaque rupture.\nAdvanced aortic atherosclerosis was induced in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 21; high cholesterol-rich diet/double-balloon aortic denudation). Animals underwent standard and CEU imaging at the end of the atherosclerosis induction period. Six age-matched animals served as control subjects. Within 24 h, animals were euthanized and aortas processed for histopathological evaluation of plaque composition and neovascularization. Imaged plaques were classified as contrast enhanced (CE) positive or CE negative, according to their contrast enhancement on CEU imaging. The lesions were also classified as class III (predominantly echogenic) or class II (predominantly echolucent), according to their echogenicity on non-CEU images.\nNo contrast enhancement was observed in control animals. In atherosclerotic animals, class III lesions showed an increased contrast enhancement compared with class II lesions and CE-positive lesions showed greater neovascularization than CE-negative plaques. Macrophage density, but not smooth muscle cell density, was significantly higher in CE-positive than CE-negative lesions. As expected, class III lesions showed increased macrophage density compared with class II plaques. Intraplaque neovessel density at histology was significantly higher in CE-positive than in CE-negative lesions. Class III plaques showed a significantly higher neovessel density compared with class II lesions. A strong correlation between intraplaque neovessels and contrast enhancement was found.\nCEU imaging is a feasible noninvasive imaging modality to evaluate intraplaque neovascularization.

{"title": "Diagnosis of pancreatic tumors by endoscopic ultrasonography.", "abstract": "Pancreatic tumors are highly diverse, as they can be solid or cystic, and benign or malignant. Since their imaging features overlap considerably, it is often difficult to characterize these tumors. In addition, small pancreatic tumors, especially those less than 2 cm in diameter, are difficult to detect and diagnose. For characterizing pancreatic tumors and detecting small pancreatic tumors, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most sensitive of the imaging procedures currently available. This technique also provides good results in terms of the preoperative staging of pancreatic tumors. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has also proved to be a safe and useful method for tissue sampling of pancreatic tumors. Despite these advantages, however, it is still difficult to differentiate between benign and malignant, solid or cystic pancreatic tumors, malignant neoplasms, and chronic pancreatitis using EUS, even when EUS-FNA is performed. Recently, contrast-enhanced EUS with Doppler mode (CE-EUS) employing ultrasound contrast agents, which indicate vascularization in pancreatic lesions, has been found to be useful in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors, especially small pancreatic tumors. However, Doppler ultrasonography with contrast-enhancement has several limitations, including blooming artifacts, poor spatial resolution, and low sensitivity to slow flow. Consequently, an echoendoscope was developed recently that has a broad-band transducer and an imaging mode that was designed specifically for contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CEH-EUS) with a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent. The CEH-EUS technique is expected to improve the differential diagnosis of pancreatic disease in the future.

The CT-perfusion (CT-p) protocol was performed with 16 slice multidetector computed tomography which included the following parameters: 8 dynamic slices/scan per 40 scans after iv injection of 50 mL of iodinated contrast (350 mg/mL) at a flow rate of 6 mL/s.

We have tested both an agonist and antagonist of Notch signaling to study the effects of Notch-mediated angiogenesis on spinal cord vascular pathology following traumatic injury. Initial neonatal retinal vascularization assays showed their respective bioactivities in vivo. Mice were treated with either the antagonist Jagged1-Fc chimera (Jag1-Fc) or agonist Notch1 antibody (N1 Ab) immediately following a mid-thoracic contusive injury through an initial jugular bolus and tail vein injections for 3 days post-injury. After 14 days, activating Notch signaling decreased the overall vascular density within the penumbral gray matter compared to controls while maintaining the density of perfused vessels. Inhibiting Notch signaling did not change the density or perfusion of microvessels within the lesion penumbra. Furthermore, neither activation nor inhibition of Notch signaling significantly altered inflammation, hypoxia, and lesion volume in the epicenter and penumbra. Importantly, neither treatment changed locomotor function. In postnatal retinal vascular assays, administration of Jag1-Fc and N1 Ab increased and decreased both tip cell numbers and branch points in each treatment, respectively. However, these agents did not modulate primary CNS EC proliferation in vitro in spite of sufficient Notch ligand expression.

The pathomechanism underlying the development of RIP has not yet been completely elucidated. The notion that the PED bursts as a result of the increased pressure stands in contrast to the theory that the CNV contracts and causes scarring which in turn causing secondary RIP. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently the preferred treatment. However, the initial stabilization of visual acuity after treatment could not be confirmed in long-term studies and after 2 years visual acuity deteriorated significantly. Furthermore, optimal VEGF treatment regimens have also not been defined and the criteria for repeated treatment have not been established as yet.

{"title": "New ligament healing model based on tissue-engineered collagen scaffolds.", "abstract": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is often the target of knee trauma. This ligament does not heal very well, leading to joint instability. Long-term instability of the knee can lead to early arthritis and loss of function. To develop efficient strategies to stimulate posttraumatic ACL regeneration in vivo, a good healing model is needed in vitro. Such a model must remain as simple as possible, but should include key features to provide relevant answers to precise questions about the clinical problem addressed. Here, we report tissue-engineered type I collagen scaffolds developed to establish an ACL healing model in vitro and a potential ACL substitute in vivo. Such scaffolds were used to evaluate ACL cell growth, migration, and the capacity to synthesize and assemble collagen fibers for up to 40 days in vitro and up to 180 days in vivo. They were anchored with two bone plugs to allow their static stretching in culture and to facilitate their surgical implantation in knee joints. Our results have shown that living ACL fibroblasts can attach, migrate, and colonize this type of scaffold. In vitro, the cells populated the scaffolds and expressed mRNAs coding for the prolyl-4-hydroxylase, involved in collagen fibers' assembly. In vivo, acellular implants were vascularized and populated with caprine cells that migrated from the osseous insertions toward the center of the grafts. This model is a very good tool to study ACL repair and identify the factors that could accelerate its healing postsurgery.", "journal": "Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["Lina MRobayo", "V\u00e9ronique JMoulin", "PierrotTremblay", "R\u00e9jeanCloutier", "JeanLamontagne", "Anne-MarieLarkin", "St\u00e9phaneChabaud", "FranckSimon", "NazrulIslam", "FrancineGoulet"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00640.x"}

Next, NP2 amiRNA or negative control amiRNA was injected intrastromally into BALB/c mouse model of suture-induced corneal neovascularization three days after surgery. Corneas were harvested 1 week after suture placement and the formation of lymphatic and blood vessels as well as the recruitment of macrophage was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The neovascularized graft beds treated by NP2 amiRNA or control then served as recipients of orthotopic corneal transplants, and age-matched C57BL/6 donors were used. Corneal allografts were examined twice a week for 8 weeks, and graft clarity was quantified by means of an opacity score.\nVEGF-C-induced NP2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels was significantly suppressed by NP2 amiRNA in mouse lymphatic endothelial cells.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of calcineurin inhibition in an animal model of renal disease.", "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is directly associated with cardiovascular complications. Heart remodelling, including fibrosis, hypertrophy, and decreased vascularization, is frequently present in renal diseases. Our objective was to investigate the impact of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) on cardiac remodelling and function in a rat model of renal disease.\nMale Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups: sham-operated rats, 5/6 nephrectomized rats (Nx) treated with vehicle, CNI (cyclosporine A 5.0 or 7.5, or tacrolimus 0.5 mg/kg/day) or hydralazine (20 mg/kg twice a day) for 14 days, starting on the day of surgery. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower and blood pressure significantly higher in Nx rats when compared with controls. Morphological and echocardiographic analyses revealed increased left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased number of capillaries in Nx rats. Treatment with CNI affected neither the renal function nor the blood pressure, but prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy and improved vascularization. In addition, regional blood volume improved as confirmed by contrast agent-based echocardiography. Hydralazine treatment did not avoid heart remodelling in this model. Gene expression analysis verified a decrease in hypertrophic genes in the heart of CNI-treated rats, while pro-angiogenic and stem cell-related genes were upregulated. Moreover, mobilization of stem/progenitor cells was increased through manipulation of the CD26/SDF-1 system.\nWe conclude from our studies that CNI-treatment significantly prevented cardiac remodelling and improved heart function in Nx rats without affecting renal function and blood pressure.

{"title": "Anterior cruciate ligament repair with LARS (ligament advanced reinforcement system): a systematic review.", "abstract": "Injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is common. Following complete rupture of the ACL, insufficient re-vascularization of the ligament prevents it from healing completely, creating a need for reconstruction. A variety of grafts are available for use in ACL reconstruction surgery, including synthetic grafts. Over the last two decades new types of synthetic ligaments have been developed. One of these synthetic ligaments, the Ligament Advanced Reinforcement System (LARS), has recently gained popularity.The aim of this systematic review was to assess the current best available evidence for the effectiveness of the LARS as a surgical option for symptomatic, anterior cruciate ligament rupture in terms of graft stability, rehabilitation time and return to pre-injury function.\nThis systematic review included studies using subjects with symptomatic, ACL ruptures undergoing LARS reconstruction. A range of electronic databases were searched in May 2010. The methodological quality of studies was appraised with a modified version of the Law critical appraisal tool. Data relating to study characteristics, surgical times, complication rates, outcomes related to knee stability, quality of life, function, and return to sport as well as details of rehabilitation programs and timeframes were collected.\nThis review identified four studies of various designs, of a moderate methodological quality. Only one case of knee synovitis was reported. Patient satisfaction with LARS was high. Graft stability outcomes were found to be inconsistent both at post operative and at follow up periods. The time frames of rehabilitation periods were poorly reported and at times omitted. Return to pre-injury function and activity was often discussed but not reported in results.\nThere is an emerging body of evidence for LARS with comparable complication rates to traditional surgical techniques, and high patient satisfaction scores. However, this systematic review has highlighted several important gaps in the existing literature that require future prospective investigation. The findings of this review were equivocal with regards to other measures such as graft stability and long term functional outcomes.

The main hurdle are preexisting antibodies, most of which are specific for 'Linear-B', carbohydrate epitopes terminated by the unbranched Gal-alpha(1,3)Gal disaccharide. These antibodies are responsible for the 'hyper-acute rejection' of the xenograft by complement mediated hemorrhage. For depletion of such antibodies we have developed an artificial injectable antigen, a glycopolymer (GAS914) with a charge neutral poly-lysine backbone (degree of polymerization n = 1000) and 25% of its side chains coupled to Linear-B-trisaccharide. With an average molecular weight of 400 to 500 kD, presenting 250 trisaccharide epitopes per molecule, this multivalent array binds anti-alphaGal antibodies with at least three orders of magnitude higher avidity on a per-saccharide basis than the monomeric epitope. In vivo experiments with non-human primates documented that rather low doses--1 to 5 mg/kg of GAS914 injected i.v.--efficiently reduce the load of anti-Linear-B antibodies quickly by at least 80%. This treatment can be repeated without any sensitization to GAS914. Interestingly, although the antibody levels start raising 12 h after injection, they do not reach pretreatment levels. The polymer is degraded and excreted within hours, with a minute fraction remaining in lymphoid tissue of anti-alphaGal producing animals only, probably binding to and inhibiting antibody-producing B-cells. The results of pig-to-non-human primate xenotransplantations established GAS914 as a relevant therapeutic option for pig-to-human transplantations as well. The synthesis of GAS914 was successfully scaled up to kg amounts needed for first clinical studies.

Transient muscular expression of the recombinant disintegrin domain (RDD) of metargidin (also known as ADAM-15) by in vivo electroporation reduced cutaneous angiogenesis and vascularization in all 3 models. As demonstrated using red fluorescent protein-coupled RDD, the treatment resulted in muscular expression of the gene product and its deposition within the cutaneous hyperangiogenic connective tissue. High-resolution ultrasound revealed reduced cutaneous blood flow in vivo after electroporation with RDD but not with control plasmids.

Ethoxidine, a benzo[c]phenanthridines derivative, camptothecin analogue, has been identified as a potent inhibitor of Top I in various cancer cell lines. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of ethoxidine on angiogenesis and cellular processes including migration, proliferation and adhesion since these processes play an important role in tumor progression. Ethoxidine was incubated for 24 h at low (10\u207b\u2079 M) and high (10\u207b\u2075 M) concentrations on two types of human endothelial cells: EaHy.926 and human umbilical endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 20 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Ethoxidine at low concentration increased cell proliferation and migration that was associated with enhanced metalloproteinase 2 expression and activity, whereas high concentration of ethoxidine inhibited all of these effects. The two concentrations of ethoxidine did not affect endothelial cell adhesion. Low concentration of ethoxidine increased VEGF expression and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression, NO and superoxide anion productions, whereas high concentration of ethoxidine did not induce any effect. Taken together, the present results highlight paradoxical effects of ethoxidine on angiogenesis depending on the concentration used. This study underscores that in addition to its anti-proliferative properties, ethoxidine may affect the generation of vascular network in tumorigenesis.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2010-12-08", "authors": ["NicolasClere", "S\u00e9bastienFaure", "Jean-JacquesHelesbeux", "OlivierDuval", "RamarosonAndriantsitohaina"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgq260"}

Human islets (100islet equivalent/mL) were cultured alone (control) or co-cultured (experimental group) with whole human BM (1 \u00d7 10(6) cells/mL) for 210 days. A protein array measuring angiogenesis factors found upregulated (experimental vs control, day 210) proteins levels of VEGF-a (535 vs 2 pg/mL), PDGF (280.79 vs 0 pg/mL), KGF (939 vs 8 pg/mL), TIMP-1 (4592 vs 4332 pg/mL) and angiogenin (506 vs 97 pg/mL). Lower protein levels of angiopoietin-2 (5 vs 709 pg/mL) were observed. Depletion of pro-angiogenesis factors in co-culture decreased the effects of BM-induced islet vascularization. Depletion of VEGF-a, eKGF and PDGF significantly reduced islet vascularization but individual depletion of KGF and PDGF had less effects overall on vessel formation. BM-induced vascularization showed significant endothelial cell distribution. Islet vascularization was linked to islet growth. A decrease in islet size indicated poor vascularization. Insulin release was evident in the tissues generated from human islet-BM co-culture throughout the entire culture period. Significant increase in insulin (28.66-fold vs control) and glucagon (24.4-fold vs control) gene expression suggest BM can induce endocrine cell regeneration.

The delivery from implants of angiogenic factors, like VEGF, has been widely investigated for establishing a vascular network within the developing tissue. In this report, we investigated if encapsulation of VEGF in nanoparticles could enhance angiogenesis in vivo as compared to free VEGF when incorporated into two different types of 3D matrices: Matrigel\u2122 hydrogels and PLGA scaffolds. Negatively charged nanoparticles encapsulating VEGF were obtained with a high efficiency by complex formation with dextran sulfate and coacervation by chitosan. After 2weeks, encapsulation reduced VEGF release from hydrogels from 30% to 1% and increased VEGF release from scaffolds from 20% to 30% in comparison with free VEGF. VEGF encapsulation consistently improved angiogenesis in vivo with both type of 3D matrices: up to 7.5- to 3.5-times more endothelial and red blood cells were observed, respectively, into hydrogels and scaffolds. Hence, encapsulation in nanoparticles enhanced VEGF efficiency by protection and controlled release from 3D implants.

Studies of skeletal dental pulp samples are of particular interest since this location is potentially exposed to bloodborne agents during life through its vascularization, and could be considered as well preserved from environment after death of the host. DNA viruses belonging to the family Anelloviridae are highly present in human populations where they harbor an extreme genetic diversity but a yet undefined implication in hosts' health. We hypothesized that anelloviruses would be detected in ancient remains and that they may also serve as tracer viruses for the study of other viral agents. We analyzed 200-year-old dental pulp samples from remains of soldiers of Napoleon's Great Army during the Russian Retreat. Successful detection of Anelloviridae DNA by PCR was obtained for 1/21 ancient samples tested.

Recently, Ang2 was suggested to play a role in adult neurogenesis, affecting migration and differentiation of adult neuroblasts in vitro. However, to date, no data have reported an effect of Ang2 on neurogenesis during embryonic development. As we detected Ang2 expression in the developing cerebral cortex at embryonic day E14.5 and E16.5, we used in utero electroporation to knock down Ang2 expression in neuronal progenitors located in the cortical ventricular zone (VZ) to examine the role of Ang2 in cortical embryonic neurogenesis. Using this strategy, we showed that radial migration from the VZ toward the cortical plate of Ang2-knocked down neurons is altered as well as their morphology. In parallel, we observed a perturbation of intermediate progenitor population and the surrounding vasculature.

GCs from three different stages were used to assess the short- and long-term effects of this hormone on follicle differentiation: 1) 2\u200ah before induction of the LH surge, 2) 6\u200ah and 3) 22\u200ah after the LH surge. The results obtained were a list of differentially expressed transcripts for each GC group. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes at play, biological annotations were used to reveal the different functions of transcripts, confirming that the LH surge acts in a temporal manner. The pre-LH group is involved in typical tasks such as cell division, development, and proliferation, while the early response to the LH surge included features such as response to stimulus, vascularization, and lipid synthesis, which are indicative of cells preparing for ovulation. The late response of GCs revealed terms associated with protein localization and intracellular transport, corresponding to the future secretion task that will be required for the transformation of GCs into corpus luteum.

Variable angle epifluorescence microscopy revealed that GNOM and VAN3 localize to partially overlapping discrete foci at the plasma membranes that are regularly associated with the endocytic vesicle coat clathrin. Genetic studies revealed that GNOM and VAN3 activities are required for endocytosis and internalization of plasma membrane proteins, including PIN-FORMED auxin transporters.

The purpose of this article is to provide a useful tool for the ultrasound (US) study of this joint. The shoulder girdle and upper arm are made up of a number of muscles and tendons: rotator cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis), humeral biceps, deltoid and pectoral muscles, which can all be evaluated at US examination. Various and complex capsular ligamentous structures contribute to the stability of the shoulder, but only a few can be adequately evaluated by US and will therefore receive particular attention. Numerous serous bursae are situated among muscles, skin, subcutaneous tissues, joint capsule structures and bones to prevent friction and they can be evaluated by US only in the presence of pathologies. Subacromial-subdeltoid and subcoracoid bursa are most frequently involved and will therefore be described in detail. There are furthermore nerves and vessels providing the various components of the shoulder with innervation and vascularization, and they can also be studied by US. The shoulder girdle (humerus, scapula, clavicle and sternal manubrium) is situated in the deep layers; only the cortex of the bone can be seen at US as a continuous hyperechoic line. For a better understanding of the location and relationship between the structures which can be studied by US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out as this method provides a wider and more complete view of the structures.\nSommarioLa conoscenza dell\u2019anatomia della spalla \u00e8 fondamentale per la valutazione della sua patologia. Scopo del presente articolo \u00e8 di fornire un adeguato strumento per la conoscenza dell\u2019anatomia e dell\u2019anatomia ecografica di quest\u2019articolazione.Numerosi muscoli e rispettivi tendini partecipano al cingolo scapolo-omerale: i costituenti la cuffia dei rotatori (sovraspinato, sottospinato, piccolo rotondo e sottoscapolare), il bicipite omerale, il deltoide e i muscoli grande e piccolo pettorale, tutti valutabili ecograficamente. Varie e complesse strutture capsulo-legamentose contribuiscono alla stabilit\u00e0 della spalla, solo alcune sono ben valutabili ecograficamente e saranno pertanto prese in considerazione in maniera paticolare. Tra muscoli, cute e sottocute, strutture capsulo-articolari e ossee si trovano numerose borse sierose il cui ruolo \u00e8 quello di evitare l\u2019attrito, sono valutabili ecograficamente esclusivamente in presenza di patologia; le borse subacromio-deltoidea e sottocoracoidea sono quelle pi\u00f9 frequentemente interessate da patologia e saranno, pertanto, descritte dettagliatamente. Sono inoltre presenti nervi e vasi che forniscono innervazione e irrorazione ai vari componenti della spalla, anch\u2019essi valutabili ecograficamente. In profondit\u00e0 si riconoscono le ossa del cingolo (omero, scapola, clavicola e manubrio sternale); dell\u2019osso \u00e8 valutabile ecograficamente solo la corticale come linea iperecogena continua.Per una pi\u00f9 semplice comprensione della disposizione spaziale e dei rapporti delle strutture valutabili ecograficamente si fa riferimento ad immagini di risonanza magnetica, caratterizzate da una maggiore panoramicit\u00e0.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound", "date": "2010-12-01", "authors": ["MPrecerutti", "EGarioni", "LMadonia", "FDraghi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jus.2010.10.005"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation of the placenta.", "abstract": "Conventional two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound has been widely used for the evaluation of the placenta during pregnancy. This 2D ultrasound evaluation includes the morphology, anatomy, location, implantation, anomaly, size, and color/power and pulsed Doppler sonographic assessment of the placenta. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound would facilitate the novel assessment of the placenta, such as surface-rendered imaging and volume measurement. With the recent advances in 3D power Doppler (3DPD) ultrasound as well as quantitative 3DPD histogram analysis, quantitative and qualitative assessments of the vascularization and blood flow of the placenta have become feasible. These novel techniques may assist in the evaluation of the feto-placental function, and offer potential advantages relative to conventional 2D sonographic assessments. 3D ultrasound may be an important modality in future placental research, in the evaluation of feto-placental insufficiency in clinical practice, and in the prediction of fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, although some limitations regarding the assessment of the placenta employing 3D ultrasound still remain unresolved.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2010-12-01", "authors": ["THata", "HTanaka", "JNoguchi", "KHata"], "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2010.11.001"}

{"title": "16 kDa prolactin reduces angiogenesis, but not growth of human breast cancer tumors in vivo.", "abstract": "Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone necessary for normal growth and development of the human breast. In addition, high levels of PRL in plasma correlate with increased risk of breast cancer, especially among postmenopausal women. Several isoforms of PRL exist in human circulation, including a 16 kDa isoform that is an N-terminal fragment of the full-length 23 kDa PRL. 16 kDa PRL has been shown to be anti-angiogenic in vitro and in vivo, and to reduce formation of tumors from prostate, colon and melanoma cancer cell lines. Here we explore the effect of 16 kDa PRL expression in vitro and in vivo using two breast cancer cell line models (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and also the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. In all three cell lines, 16 kDa PRL expression inhibited cell proliferation in vitro compared to empty vector controls. In vivo results were markedly different between the two types of cell lines. HCT-116 cells expressing 16 kDa PRL exhibited reduced vascularization and tumor formation, consistent with published results. The breast cancer cell lines expressing 16 kDa PRL also exhibited inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo but no reduction in tumor size or formation. These results suggest that the effects of 16 kDa PRL on tumor formation may vary across tissue types. The unique sensitivity of breast cancer to PRL as a mitogen and/or additional factors in the mammary gland environment (e.g. local hormone/mitogen concentration) may play a dominant role in tumor formation in vivo, thus outweighing the anti-angiogenesis effects and in vitro reduction in cell proliferation induced by 16 kDa PRL.", "journal": "Hormones & cancer", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["J MFaupel-Badger", "EGinsburg", "J MFleming", "LSusser", "TDoucet", "B KVonderhaar"], "doi": "10.1007/s12672-010-0012-z\n10.1007/s10911-008-9063-y\n10.1210/er.2001-0036\n10.1016/j.mce.2005.01.005\n10.1210/me.15.5.819\n10.1159/000094309\n10.1210/endo-121-6-2055\n10.1210/me.2004-0200\n10.1677/joe.0.1660053\n10.1167/iovs.03-1346\n10.1038/labinvest.3700662\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.036\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300294\n10.1210/en.133.3.1292\n10.1677/jme.0.0300031\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.01148.x\n10.1210/jcem-57-5-942\n10.1210/endo-122-6-2892\n10.1023/A:1023956223037\n10.1210/en.130.3.1380\n10.1210/endo-125-2-1054"}

Here, we identified suppressed formation of a novel reparative lipid mediator 14S,21R-dihydroxydocosa-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid (14S,21R-diHDHA) in cutaneous wounds of diabetic db/db mice. These results indicate that diabetes impedes the biosynthetic pathways of 14S,21R-diHDHA in skin wounds. Administration of exogenous 14S,21R-diHDHA to wounds in diabetic animals rescued healing and angiogenesis. When db/db mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were administered together with 14S,21R-diHDHA to wounds in diabetic animals, they coacted to accelerate wound re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and synergistically improved vascularization. In the pivotal cellular processes of angiogenesis, 14S,21R-diHDHA enhanced VEGF release, vasculature formation, and migration of db/db dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs), as well as remedied paracrine angiogenic functions of db/db MSCs, including VEGF secretion and the promotion of DMVEC migration and vasculature formation. Our results show that 14S,21R-diHDHA activates the p38 MAPK pathway in wounds, db/db MSCs, and DMVECs. Overall, the impeded formation of 14S,21R-diHDHA described in this study suggests that diabetes could affect the generation of pro-healing lipid mediators in wound healing.

We divided the patients into two groups, those with and those without moyamoya vessels, and compared clinical backgrounds and angiographic findings between the groups. Of the 26 patients, 17 had moyamoya vessels. The presence of moyamoya vessels was associated with ipsilateral or contralateral anterior cerebral artery stenosis to the occluded MCA (P = .004) and poor development of anterior leptomeningeal anastomosis (P = .012).

{"title": "New technique of reconstruction for medial elbow instability.", "abstract": "This study reports a new substitution technique as a choice to repair both acute and chronic injuries of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. Different researchers have described different techniques to reconstruct the medial ligament complex with similar results (with the use of grafts). There is a shared variable in the latest reports, the interpretation of the anterior bundle as the most important structure, for medial elbow stability and the only structure to be repaired as well. The approach to the medial structures of the elbow is similar to most of the surgical techniques. It consists of an incision on the medial aspect of the elbow, centered on the epicondyle, of length 4 inches. The reconstruction uses a strip of the aponeurosis of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) reinforced with Kracow stitches. The graft is harvested using the strong aponeurosis of the FCU, a vascularized structure, a viable option and with sufficient resistance to bear the tension of the inner aspect of the elbow. The surgical morbidity is also reduced as the graft is not taken from other zones. As the distal insertion of the neo-ligament, the proximal fixation of the FCU is used in the sublime tubercle, inverting the direction of the fibers of this strip from distal to proximal. The proximal fixation of this ligament is an osseous tunnel in the epitroclea secured with an interference screw. Common complications are those resulting from the approach and the ulnar nerve manipulation.

We have developed a novel class of steroidal compounds aimed at blocking the angiogenic process in cancerous tissues. Our lead compound, SR16388, is a potent antiangiogenic agent with binding affinity to estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) and -\u03b2 (ER-\u03b2) at the nanomolar range. This compound inhibited the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and various types of human cancer cells in vitro. SR16388 inhibited embryonic angiogenesis as measured in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The blood vessel density in the CAM was greatly reduced after the embryos were treated with 3\u00a0\u03bcg/CAM of SR16388 for 24\u00a0h. SR16388 at a dose of 2\u00a0\u03bcM prevented tube formation in Matrigel after HMVEC cells were treated for 8\u00a0h. In a modified Boyden chamber assay, SR16388 inhibited the migration of HMVECs by 80% at 500\u00a0nM. Using a novel in vivo Fibrin Z-chamber model, we demonstrated that SR16388 at a single daily oral dose of 3\u00a0mg/kg for 12 days significantly inhibited the granulation tissue (GT) thickness and the microvessel density of the GT as compared to control. More importantly, SR16388 down-regulated the pro-angiogenic transcription factors, hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Together, these effects of SR16388 can lead to the reduction of vascularization and tumor growth in vivo.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["Wan-RuChao", "KhalidAmin", "YihuiShi", "PeterHobbs", "MasTanabe", "MaryTanga", "LingJong", "NathanCollins", "RichardPeters", "KeithLaderoute", "DominicDinh", "DawnYean", "CarolHou", "BarbaraSato", "CarstenAlt", "LidiaSambucetti"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-010-9191-z"}
{"title": "[Cutaneous calciphylaxis].", "abstract": "Calciphylaxis represents a dermatological emergency with a mortality of up to 80%. The disease is characterized by a triad of arteriolar medial calcification, thrombotic cutaneous ischemia and necrotic ulcerations. Recently several mechanisms of vascular calcification have been identified. This may led to preventive measures in the future. Early diagnosis is important to avoid complications such as sepsis. The dermatologist plays an important role in early diagnosis based on the recognition of clinical presentation and histopathology. Patients with end-stage renal disease are most commonly affected by calciphylaxis. The most frequent non-uremic predisposing conditions are primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancies, alcohol-induced liver disease, and autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Medical treatment aims to normalize mineral metabolism to reduce the serum concentration of sodium phosphate and thus to prevent precipitation and calcification. Newer compounds are bisphosphonates, non-sodium/non-aluminium phosphate binders, cinacalcet, paricalcitrol, and sodium thiosulfate. Among the surgical procedures parathyroidectomy did not result in a significant survival benefit. An aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic ulcerations, on the other hand, improved survival. Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary treatment approach including re-vascularization by the vascular surgeon, repeated surgical debridement and split skin transplantation support wound healing and insure limb conservation.", "journal": "Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["UWollina"], "doi": "10.1007/s00105-010-2026-4"}

Tissue samples (greater omentum) were collected from 14 patients operated with different reasons in our Department of General Surgery, in order to histologically present the presence of S-100 in the cells making up the milky spots in human omentum tissue. Tissue samples were cut approximately 5-8 micrometer thick with frozen-sections and stained with an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, as described previously. Then milky spots were examined by light microscopy. These data indicate that unstimulated milky spots in the human greater omentum are to a great extent just a preformed specific accumulation of primarily macrophages within the stroma of the greater omentum, secondarily B- and T-lymphocytes. In addition to these cells, we observed that a few mast and reticular cells were seen in the milky spots by S-100 reactive cross-sections of greater omentum.

{"title": "Tumour vascularization via endothelial differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a highly angiogenetic malignancy, the neoformed vessels of which are thought to arise by sprouting of pre-existing brain capillaries. The recent demonstration that a population of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) maintains glioblastomas indicates that the progeny of these cells may not be confined to the neural lineage. Normal neural stem cells are able to differentiate into functional endothelial cells. The connection between neural stem cells and the endothelial compartment seems to be critical in glioblastoma, where cancer stem cells closely interact with the vascular niche and promote angiogenesis through the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (refs 5-9). Here we show that a variable number (range 20-90%, mean 60.7%) of endothelial cells in glioblastoma carry the same genomic alteration as tumour cells, indicating that a significant portion of the vascular endothelium has a neoplastic origin. The vascular endothelium contained a subset of tumorigenic cells that produced highly vascularized anaplastic tumours with areas of vasculogenic mimicry in immunocompromised mice. In vitro culture of GSCs in endothelial conditions generated progeny with phenotypic and functional features of endothelial cells. Likewise, orthotopic or subcutaneous injection of GSCs in immunocompromised mice produced tumour xenografts, the vessels of which were primarily composed of human endothelial cells. Selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by GSCs in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction and degeneration, indicating the functional relevance of the GSC-derived endothelial vessels. These findings describe a new mechanism for tumour vasculogenesis and may explain the presence of cancer-derived endothelial-like cells in several malignancies.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["LuciaRicci-Vitiani", "RobertoPallini", "MauroBiffoni", "MatildeTodaro", "GloriaInvernici", "ToniaCenci", "GiulioMaira", "Eugenio AgostinoParati", "GiorgioStassi", "Luigi MariaLarocca", "RuggeroDe Maria"], "doi": "10.1038/nature09557"}

For each patient, measurements of the vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index were repeated twice under both manual and automatic sphere contour modes. Forty patients were randomly selected for another round of examination by observer 2 under the same setting. The reproducibility of vascularization measurements was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (intra-CC), interclass correlation coefficient (inter-CC), and 95% limits of agreement (LOAs). Various analysis of variance models were used to estimate the contribution of each factor (observer, contour mode, and patient) to measurement variance.\nFor each observer, the manual contour mode outperformed the automatic sphere contour mode in reproducibility (intra-CC, 0.96 to 0.99 versus 0.77 to 0.94). In addition, repeated measurements of the manual mode had a smaller SD and a narrower LOA. For the manual contour mode, interobserver agreement was comparable with intraobserver agreement (inter-CC, 0.91 to 0.98, versus intra-CC, 0.96 to 0.99).

Hence, we investigated the role of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, as novel therapeutic targets against NSCLC. We observed expression of CB1 (24%) and CB2 (55%) in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, we have shown that the treatment of NSCLC cell lines (A549 and SW-1573) with CB1/CB2- and CB2-specific agonists Win55,212-2 and JWH-015, respectively, significantly attenuated random as well as growth factor-directed in vitro chemotaxis and chemoinvasion in these cells. We also observed significant reduction in focal adhesion complex, which plays an important role in migration, upon treatment with both JWH-015 and Win55,212-2. In addition, pretreatment with CB1/CB2 selective antagonists, AM251 and AM630, prior to JWH-015 and Win55,212-2 treatments, attenuated the agonist-mediated inhibition of in vitro chemotaxis and chemoinvasion. In addition, both CB1 and CB2 agonists Win55,212-2 and JWH-133, respectively, significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis (\u223c50%). These effects were receptor mediated, as pretreatment with CB1/CB2 antagonists abrogated CB1/CB2 agonist-mediated effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Reduced proliferation and vascularization, along with increased apoptosis, were observed in tumors obtained from animals treated with JWH-133 and Win55,212-2. Upon further elucidation into the molecular mechanism, we observed that both CB1 and CB2 agonists inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, a key signaling molecule controlling cell survival, migration, and apoptosis, and reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and activity.

We report also the result of this vascularized bone graft for the revascularization of the lunatum in 22 patients with Kienb\u00f6ck's disease with an average follow-up of 74 months (60-124). The postoperative MRI control with a minimum of 8 months showed 17 healing, three stabilizations of lesions and two failures requiring a secondary palliative surgery.

Limbal allografting from related live human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (n = 10) and-unmatched donors (n = 2) was performed in 12 consecutive patients (12 eyes) with limbal stem cell deficiency secondary to ocular chemical burn, including 9 alkali burn and 3 acid burn; whereas allolimbal cadaver transplant was performed in another 15 patients in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center between April 2006 to December 2007. Systemic cyclosporine A was administered to later eight recipients in living related donor group and all patients in cadaver donor group. Main outcome measures were restoration of corneal epithelium, reduction in corneal vascularization, improved corneal clarity, and visual improvement. Mean follow-up was (11.4 \u00b1 3.6) months (from 12 to 27).\nIn living related donor group, ten patients (83.3%) achieved initially reepithelialize, and epithelial healing time was (9.6 \u00b1 3.4) d. Nine patients (75.0%) achieved stable ocular surface (stable corneal epithelium, decreased vascularization of corneal surface, and reduced corneal opacification). However, in seven eyes (77.8%) achieved stable ocular surface, gradual recurrence of peripheral corneal vascularization occurred after 5 to 8 months postoperatively. Whereas in cadaver donor group, twelve patients (80.0%) achieved initially reepithelialize, and epithelial healing time was (11.2 \u00b1 4.6) d. Seven patients (46.7%) achieved stable ocular surface. However, in all seven eyes achieved stable ocular surface, gradual recurrence of peripheral corneal vascularization occurred after 4 to 10 months postoperatively. The differences of both the rate of initially reepithelialize and epithelial healing time between these two groups showed no statistical significance (\u03c7(2) = 1.764, P = 0.117; t = 0.116, P = 0.133, respectively). However, the differences of both the successful rate of ocular surface reconstruction and the recurrent rate of corneal vascularization during the follow-up period between these two groups were statistically significant (\u03c7(2) = 4.158, P = 0.015; \u03c7(2) = 3.463, P = 0.022, respectively). In living related donor group, features of graft rejection developed in two patients with postoperative stable ocular surface, Both rejected recipients had one among HLA-matched and one among-unmatched respectively. Whereas in cadaver donor group, features of graft rejection developed in three patients with postoperative stable ocular surface. None of the donor eyes had any complications.\nLimbal allografting from related live donors is more effective to reconstruct the ocular surface of limbal stem cell deficiency secondary to ocular chemical burn than allolimbal cadaver transplant. HLA-matched limbal allografting could reduce postoperative graft rejection and systemic cyclosporine A is useful in ensuring long-term survival.", "journal": "[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["TingHuang", "Shi-qingYang", "NaGao", "Yu-juanWang"], "doi": null}

An anatomic study based on 30 dissections after colorized latex injection established the constancy of the radial styloid process's artery, while showing that its origin, course and length were subject to variations. In a retrospective series of 38 cases over a period of 10 years, the vascularized bone graft was indicated for: (1) scaphoid non-union with the presence of avascular changes of the proximal fragment (23 cases); (2) failed prior reconstruction with bone graft and internal fixation (nine cases); (3) degenerative styloid-scaphoid arthritis (three cases); (4) fracture on Preiser dystrophy (three cases). The five steps of the simplified operative technique without dissection of the vascular pedicle include: (1) longitudinal dorso-radial approach, identification of the periosteal portion of the radial styloid process artery; (2) incision of the first and second compartments, longitudinal arthrotomy under the second compartment; (3) styloidectomy and transversal resection of the scaphoid non-union and sclerotic bone; (4) elevation of the vascularized bone graft; (5) transversal and radial insertion of the vascularized bone graft, osteosynthesis by two or three K-wire touching the scaphoid's radial edge. Scaphoid union was obtained in 33 cases out of 38. The only postoperative complications were two transient radial paresthesia.

Our research on the anatomo-topographical and bio-mechanical aspect of the Trapezium-Trapezoid-Metacarpal bi-articular complex (TM-TZM) has led us to observe that trapezoid-metacarpal joint (TZM) is a working joint, which has remained inactive for many years, a true joint bank for the TM joint. When it is transposed at the base of the thumb column, it is obliged to move according to the active movements of the intrinsic and the extrinsic muscles. Since January 1998, 34 patients have been operated on, replacing the trapezio-metacarpal (TM) joint with trapezoid-metacarpal (TZM) joint and vice-versa. Rotatory transfer of trapezoid-metacarpal pro-trapezio-metacarpal joint was achieved preserving entirely the intrinsic ligaments and the dorsal branch of the radial artery, which rotates palmarly with the biarticular complex thus ensuring vascular supply. Procedure consists in a wrist dorso-radial approach, metaphyseal osteotomy of first and second metacarpal bases, capsulotomy all around and rotatory transfer of the bi-articular complex, stabilization with K wires of osteotomies and capsulo-ligamentous reconstruction. Follow-up evaluation of the patients ranged between 3 months and 10 years (mean 4 years). Results have been excellent in 24 cases and good in 10. Painless motion, stability due to the first metacarpal ray length reconstruction with a subsequent redistribution of forces along the entire axis, restored thumb opposition, pinch and grip strength of the hand have been obtained. In conclusion, this technique represents now a new surgical opportunity for a surgeon to choose a straightforward and reliable treatment in a wider range of care for degenerative arthritis or severe and destructive trauma of the TMC joint.

There is high pressure to develop new drugs to prevent and treat ROP. There is increasing enthusiasm for anti-VEGF drugs, but angiogenic inhibitors selective for abnormal blood vessels would be considered as an optimal treatment.In an animal experimental model of proliferative retinopathy, we have recently demonstrated that the pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors improves retinal neovascularization and blood retinal barrier breakdown consequent to hypoxia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the propranolol administration in preterm newborns suffering from a precocious phase of ROP in terms of safety and efficacy in counteracting the progression of retinopathy.\nPreterm newborns (gestational age at birth lower than 32 weeks) with stage 2 ROP (zone II-III without plus) will be randomized, according to their gestational age, to receive propranolol added to standard treatment (treatment adopted by the ETROP Cooperative Group) or standard treatment alone. Propranolol will be administered until retinal vascularization will be completely developed, but not more than 90 days. Forty-four participants will be recruited into the study. To evaluate the safety of propranolol administration, cardiac and respiratory parameters will be continuously monitored. Blood samplings will be performed to check renal, liver and metabolic balance. To evaluate the efficacy of propranolol, the progression of the disease, the number of laser treatments or vitrectomies, the incidence of retinal detachment or blindness, will be evaluated by serial ophthalmologic examinations. Visual function will be evaluated by means of behavioural standardized tests.\nThis pilot study is the first research that explores the possible therapeutic role of beta blockers in ROP. The objective of this research is highly ambitious: to find a treatment simple, inexpensive, well tolerated and with few adverse effects, able to counteract one of the major complications of the prematurity. Any favourable results of this research could open new perspectives and original scenarios about the treatment or the prevention of this and other proliferative retinopathies.\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN18523491; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01079715; EudraCT Number 2010-018737-21.", "journal": "BMC pediatrics", "date": "2010-11-23", "authors": ["LucaFilippi", "GiacomoCavallaro", "PatrizioFiorini", "MartaDaniotti", "ValentinaBenedetti", "GloriaCristofori", "GabriellaAraimo", "LucaRamenghi", "AgostinoLa Torre", "PinaFortunato", "LilianaPollazzi", "Giancarlola Marca", "SabrinaMalvagia", "PaolaBagnoli", "ChiaraRistori", "MassimoDal Monte", "Anna RitaBilia", "BenedettaIsacchi", "SandraFurlanetto", "FrancescaTinelli", "GiovanniCioni", "GianpaoloDonzelli", "SilviaOsnaghi", "FabioMosca"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2431-10-83\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.11.009\n10.1542/peds.2004-1413\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.05.001\n10.2741/1056\n10.1242/dev.01732\n10.1167/iovs.08-2584\n10.1038/nm1095-1024\n10.1038/359843a0\n10.1210/er.18.1.4\n10.1073/pnas.92.3.905\n10.1210/en.133.2.848\n10.3109/08977199809017487\n10.1074/jbc.274.23.16349\n10.1093/emboj/20.11.2768\n10.1073/pnas.101113998\n10.1542/peds.112.5.1016\n10.1001/archopht.124.12.1711\n10.1038/70963\n10.1542/peds.105.2.295\n10.1001/archopht.124.2.199\n10.1001/archopht.121.12.1684\n10.1136/bjo.2005.081166\n10.1001/archophthalmol.2010.72\n10.1016/S0161-6420(01)01017-X\n10.1016/S0161-6420(01)01015-6\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e318177f934\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e318159ec6b\n10.1056/NEJMc0708819\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.09.048\n10.1074/jbc.275.18.13802\n10.1016/j.bbi.2008.10.005\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2496\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1698\n10.1038/nm1447\n10.1023/A:1024491219366\n10.1002/ijc.21723\n10.1161/01.RES.0000191541.06788.bb\n10.1542/peds.2007-0803\n10.1016/j.exer.2006.08.018\n10.1074/jbc.M300368200\n10.1080/08977190802442070\n10.1167/iovs.07-0129\n10.1016/j.autneu.2005.05.006\n10.1016/j.neuint.2006.08.004\n10.1007/s10456-007-9066-0\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.03.010\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.10.042\n10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02204.x\n10.1016/j.jpba.2008.09.025\n10.1167/iovs.09-4723\n10.1136/bjo.2007.128371\n10.1007/s00381-002-0567-2\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000141524.32142.53"}

Among matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), both MMP-2 and 9 digest type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane, and MMP-14/MT1-MMP, a membrane-type MMP, activates MMP-2. Thus, these MMPs play a central role in cancer cell invasion.

Indication for mandibular resection were squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and alveolar ridge in 5 cases, ameloblastome of the mandible in 6 cases, odontogenic keratocyst in 3 cases, defect due to fire arm injury in 2 cases and central giant cell granuloma of the mandible in one case. The type of reconstruction performed was primary reconstruction in 11 patients and secondary in 6 patients.\nThere were 17 patients including 14 males and 3 females with mean age of 40 years. All flaps except three survived. One patient died due to complications related to blood transfusion. Of those, 2 completely failed, one due to the unfavourable recipient bed of the patient with fire arm injury and other due to venous thrombosis. Donor site morbidity was low; there was some compromise in the ankle function but none of the patient complaint of foot drop. Simple problems with wound healing such as dehiscence and delayed wound healing developed in 5 patients, which usually required only local antiseptic treatment. After the operation patient began oral feeding and walking with some aid in fourth week and became completely ambulant in 8 weeks.\nIn this small series the free fibula flap was a versatile and reliable option for microvascular reconstruction of large mandibular defects.

ORT: donor femoral vessels were anastomosed to recipient femoral vessels, the sciatic nerve approximated end-to-end and osteosynthesis was performed using an intramedullary rod. HET/cervical: Donor femoral vessels of a reduced size osteomyocutaneous hind limb CTA were anastomosed to recipient common carotid artery and external jugular vein without nerve approximation.\nBoth procedures could be performed with a high success rate (ORT: 62%; HET: 90%). Donor operation lasted for 100\u00b112 min and recipient operation 114\u00b127 min (ORT) and 54\u00b116 min (HET).

{"title": "[Vascularized periosteum and bone regeneration].", "abstract": "The osteogenic potential of periosteum is widely recognized. During development, it plays a prominent role in the radial growth of long bones. Similarly, it has a key role in the consolidation of fractures. The physiological function of periosteum in the healthy, mature skeleton remains relatively subtle; however, its detachment from the bone surface reactivates its potential for fibrogenic and osteochondrogenic regeneration. This discreet anatomical structure is actually a reservoir of mesenchymal progenitor cells capable of proliferating and differentiating, by reinitializing cellular and molecular cascades of embryogenesis in mesenchymal tissues. However, given the hitherto limited knowledge of the quantitative potential of periosteum and of the pathways regulating tissue differentiation during regeneration, human applications have remained anecdotal. The findings of several in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that the maintenance of the periosteum's vascularization stimulates its quantitative potential. The structural organization of the regenerated material in vivo is governed by locoregional biological and mechanical regulatory mechanisms that serve to make it capable of performing its new functions. The increasing awareness of periosteum's potential is stimulating active research in the fields of cellular biology and tissue engineering. The demonstration of its regenerative potential in animals gives reason to believe that strips of vascularized periosteum could become part of the developing armamentarium of regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Chirurgie de la main", "date": "2010-11-16", "authors": ["DMoukoko"], "doi": "10.1016/j.main.2010.09.008"}

The surgical technique for PIP and MTP vascularised transplantation is described with special emphasis on recent improvements (use of a short vascular pedicle, refinements in donor site reconstruction). Results of a series of 50 transfers performed between 1992 and 2009 are presented. PIP transfer was performed in 37 patients, at an average age of 18.3 years (range 3 to 40) leading to an average active ROM of 44\u00b0 (0-80), with a lag of extension of 34.2\u00b0 (0-80). MCP transfer was performed in 12 patients (13 transfers), at an average age of 21.3 years (range 3 to 40) leading to an average range of motion of 60\u00b0 (35-80), with a lag of extension of 18.6\u00b0 (0-30). None of the reconstructed articulations was painful. On the plain radiographs, no degradation of the joint space of the transferred articulations was noted. Within the pediatric population, the growth potential was preserved, signing the perenniality of the vascularization of the transfers. When faced to a complete joint destruction involving either the PIP or the MCP of the long fingers, reconstruction can be achieved by the mean of a vascularized joint transfer. The range of motion obtained with these transfers is not superior to what is observed after arthroplasty but it will persist with time.

RTNs carrying luciferase genes were administered intravenously to mice carrying subcutaneous neuroblastoma tumours. Luciferase expression was much higher in tumours than in liver, spleen and lungs while plasmid biodistribution studies supported the expression data. Transfection in tumours was enhanced two-fold by integrin-targeting peptides compared to non-targeted nanocomplexes.

However, the junction exponent is normally calculated iteratively from diameter measurements, and Monte-Carlo simulation studies show the junction exponent to be biased in the presence of measurement noise.We present an alternative parameter, referred to as optimality ratio, that is simpler to compute and also more robust in the presence of noise.To demonstrate the sensitivity of the optimality ratio to alterations in topography of the retinal vascular network, we analysed the effect of inducing endothelial dysfunction by infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, compared to placebo in a double-blind crossover study. The optimality ratio showed a significant increase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) during infusion of l-NMMA compared to placebo.We propose that a measure of the extent of departure of optimality ratio from its optimal\u00a0value of 2(-1/3) may be a useful indicator of microvascular endothelial dysfunction in\u00a0vivo.", "journal": "Artery research", "date": "2010-11-13", "authors": ["Nicholas WWitt", "NeilChapman", "Simon A McGThom", "Alice VStanton", "Kim HParker", "Alun DHughes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.artres.2010.06.003"}

Progress made in cell and stem cell biology, material sciences and tissue engineering enabled researchers to develop cutting-edge technology which has lead to the creation of nonmodular tissue constructs such as skin, bladders, vessels and upper airways. In all cases, autologous cells were seeded on either artificial or natural supporting scaffolds.

Models of functioning hearts and livers have been engineered using \"natural tissue\" scaffolds and efforts are underway to produce kidneys, pancreata and small intestine. Creation of custom-made bioengineered organs, where the cellular component is exquisitely autologous and have an internal vascular network, will theoretically overcome the two major hurdles in transplantation, namely the shortage of organs and the toxicity deriving from lifelong immunosuppression.

In this study, porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) was used to guide human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) adhesion and proliferation as a potential system for vascularization of engineered tissues. We fabricated PADM using a modified protocol and assessed their composition and ultrastructures. Subsequently, the viability of HUVECs and the formation of capillary-like networks were evaluated by seeding cells directly on PADM scaffolds or PADM digests in vitro. We further investigated the function of the HUVECs seeded on the PADM scaffolds after subcutaneous transplantation in athymic mice. Moreover, the function of the neovessels formed in the PADM scaffolds was assessed by implantation into cutaneous wounds on the backs of mice. The results showed that PADM scaffolds significantly increased proliferation of HUVECs, and the PADM digest induced HUVECs formed many tube-like structures. Moreover, HUVECs seeded on the PADM scaffolds formed numerous capillary-like networks and some perfused vascular structures after implantation into mice. PADM seeded with HUVECs and fibroblasts were also able to form many capillary-like networks in vitro. Further, these neovessels could inosculate with the murine vasculature after implantation into cutaneous wounds in mice. The advantage of this method is that the decellularized matrix not only provides signals to maintain the viability of endothelial cells but also serves as the template structure for regenerated tissue.

{"title": "NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species production activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) via the ERK pathway after hyperthermia treatment.", "abstract": "Hyperthermia (HT) is a strong adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy because it causes tumor reoxygenation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of how HT enhances tumor oxygenation have not been elucidated. Here we report that 1 h of HT activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in tumors and its downstream targets, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). Consistent with HIF-1 activation and up-regulation of its downstream genes, HT also enhances tumor perfusion/vascularization and decreases oxygen consumption. As a result, tumor hypoxia is reduced after HT, suggesting that these physiological changes contribute to HT-induced tumor reoxygenation. Because HIF-1 is a potent regulator of tumor vascularization and metabolism, our findings suggest that HIF-1 plays a role in HT-induced tumor reoxygenation by transactivating its downstream targets. We demonstrate that NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species production, as a mechanism, up-regulates HIF-1 after HT. Furthermore, we determine that this pathway is initiated by increased transcription of NADPH oxidase-1 through the ERK pathway. In conclusion, this study determines that, although HIF-1 is a good therapeutic target, the timing of its inhibition needs to be optimized to achieve the most beneficial outcome when it is combined with other treatments of HT, radiation, and chemotherapy.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2010-11-10", "authors": ["Eui JungMoon", "PierreSonveaux", "Paolo EPorporato", "PierreDanhier", "BernardGallez", "InesBatinic-Haberle", "Yu-ChihNien", "ThiesSchroeder", "Mark WDewhirst"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1006646107"}

We have previously shown that PEDF can be phosphorylated and that distinct phosphorylations differentially regulate its physiological functions. We also demonstrated that triple phosphomimetic mutant (EEE-PEDF), has significantly increased antiangiogenic activity and is much more efficient than WT-PEDF in inhibiting neovascularization and tumor growth. The enhanced antiangiogenic effect was associated with a direct ability to facilitate apoptosis of tumor-residing endothelial cells (ECs), and subsequently, disruption of intratumoral vascularization. In the present report, we elucidated the molecular mechanism by which EEE-PEDF exerts more profound effects at the cellular level. We found that EEE-PEDF suppresses EC proliferation due to caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and also inhibits migration of the EC much better than WT-PEDF. Although WT-PEDF and EEE-PEDF did not affect proliferation and did not induce apoptosis of cancer cells, these agents efficiently inhibited cancer cell motility, with EEE-PEDF showing a stronger effect. The stronger activity of EEE-PEDF was correlated with a better binding to laminin receptors. Furthermore, the proapoptotic and antimigratory activities of WT-PEDF and EEE-PEDF were found regulated by differential activation of two distinct MAPK pathways, namely JNK and p38, respectively. We show that JNK and p38 phosphorylation is much higher in cells treated with EEE-PEDF. JNK leads to apoptosis of ECs, whereas p38 leads to anti-migratory effect in both EC and cancer cells.

However, the main impediment for the oral delivery of these drugs as potential therapeutic agents is their extensive pre-systemic metabolism, instability in acidic environment resulting into inadequate and erratic oral absorption. Parenteral route of administration is the only established route that overcomes all these drawbacks associated with these orally less/inefficient drugs. But, these formulations are costly, have least patient compliance, require repeated administration, in addition to the other hazardous effects associated with this route. Over the last few decades pharmaceutical scientists throughout the world are trying to explore transdermal and transmucosal routes as an alternative to injections. Historically, oral transmucosal drug delivery has received intensive interest since ancient times for the most widely utilized route of administration for the systemic delivery of drugs. In more recent years, better systemic bioavailability of many drugs has been achieved by oromucosal route. Among the various transmucosal sites available, soft-palatal mucosa was also found to be the most convenient and easily accessible novel site for the delivery of therapeutic agents for systemic delivery as retentive dosage forms, because it has abundant vascularization and rapid cellular recovery time after exposure to stress. Smooth surface of the soft palate and its good flexibility are prerequisites to prevent mechanical irritation and local discomfort. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the most promising advances in novel non-invasive soft-palatal route and the conceptual and technical approaches to the design and formulation of soft-palatal drug delivery systems.

{"title": "Current concept of partial anterior cruciate ligament ruptures.", "abstract": "A partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament is a frequent pattern of ACL injury, observed in 10 to 27% of isolated ACL lesions. There are three reasons to preserve these remnants: biomechanical, vascular and proprioceptive advantages for the patient. Good quality fibers work as graft protection during the healing process. Periligamentous and endoligamentous vessels present into the native ACL tissue may enhance the vascularization of the ACL augmentation. Mechanoreceptors still remaining in the residual ACL fibers may have proprioceptive function. Definition is controversial, based on anatomy, on clinical examination, on instrumental laxity assessment or on MRI findings. Continuous remnant ACL fibers bridging the femur and tibia, from native femoral ACL footprint to native tibial ACL footprint seem to be a good definition. Diagnostic is suspected by accumulation of arguments brought by a thorough clinical examination, precise MRI analysis and examination under anesthesia. But the final diagnostic needs an arthroscopic evaluation to confirm the presence of fibers in good position and to validate its good mechanical properties. The treatment of ACL partial tear is a demanding surgery; difficulties to visualize the graft insertion site, especially on the femoral side, require a perfect knowledge of the normal anatomy of the native ACL footprint. Adapted portals, perfect controls of the tunnel drilling process, intercondylar notch space management are the keys of success.

This signaling system is required for normal vascular development in the retina and for vascular survival in the cochlea.

Here, we characterize Ndp expression during mouse development by studying a knock-in mouse that carries the coding sequence of human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) inserted at the Ndp locus (Ndp(AP)). In the CNS, Ndp(AP) expression is apparent by E10.5 and is dynamic and complex. The anatomically delimited regions of Ndp(AP) expression observed prenatally in the CNS are replaced postnatally by widespread expression in astrocytes in the forebrain and midbrain, Bergman glia in the cerebellum, and M\u00fcller glia in the retina. In the developing and adult cochlea, Ndp(AP) expression is closely associated with two densely vascularized regions, the stria vascularis and a capillary plexus between the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion.

Histological and ultrastructural observations ex vivo demonstrated a highly organized ligamentous structure, rich in type I collagen fibers and cells. Grafts' vascularization and innervation were observed in all bACLs that were entirely reconstructed in vitro.

Although the sensitivity of this procedure is very good, its specificity is somewhat limited due to fluorescence false-positive sites. Consequently, magnification cystoscopy has been investigated in order to discriminate false from true fluorescence positive findings. Both white-light and fluorescence modes are possible with the magnification cystoscope, allowing observation of the bladder wall with magnification ranging between 30\u00d7 for standard observation and 650\u00d7. The optical zooming setup allows adjusting the magnification continuously in situ. In the high-magnification (HM) regime, the smallest diameter of the field of view is 600 microns and the resolution is 2.5 microns when in contact with the bladder wall. With this cystoscope, we characterized the superficial vascularization of the fluorescing sites in order to discriminate cancerous from noncancerous tissues. This procedure allowed us to establish a classification based on observed vascular patterns. Seventy-two patients subject to Hexvix\u00ae fluorescence cystoscopy were included in the study.

{"title": "Moderation of calpain activity promotes neovascular integration and lumen formation during VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Successful neovascularization requires that sprouting endothelial cells (ECs) integrate to form new vascular networks. However, architecturally defective, poorly integrated vessels with blind ends are typical of pathological angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), thereby limiting the utility of VEGF for therapeutic angiogenesis and aggravating ischemia-related pathologies. Here we investigated the possibility that over-exuberant calpain activity is responsible for aberrant VEGF neovessel architecture and integration. Calpains are a family of intracellular calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine proteases that regulate cellular functions through proteolysis of numerous substrates.\nIn a mouse skin model of VEGF-driven angiogenesis, retroviral transduction with dominant-negative (DN) calpain-I promoted neovessel integration and lumen formation, reduced blind ends, and improved vascular perfusion. Moderate doses of calpain inhibitor-I improved VEGF-driven angiogenesis similarly to DN calpain-I. Conversely, retroviral transduction with wild-type (WT) calpain-I abolished neovessel integration and lumen formation. In vitro, moderate suppression of calpain activity with DN calpain-I or calpain inhibitor-I increased the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau in endothelial cells (ECs), increased the average length of microtubules, increased actin cable length, and increased the interconnectivity of vascular cords. Conversely, WT calpain-I diminished tau, collapsed microtubules, disrupted actin cables, and inhibited integration of cord networks. Consistent with the critical importance of microtubules for vascular network integration, the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol supported vascular cord integration whereas microtubule dissolution with nocodazole collapsed cord networks.\nThese findings implicate VEGF-induction of calpain activity and impairment of cytoskeletal dynamics in the failure of VEGF-induced neovessels to form and integrate properly. Accordingly, calpain represents an important target for rectifying key vascular defects associated with pathological angiogenesis and for improving therapeutic angiogenesis with VEGF.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2010-11-05", "authors": ["Mien VHoang", "Janice ANagy", "Joan E BFox", "Donald RSenger"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0013612"}

Natural resistance to Leishmania transmission in residents of endemic areas has been attributed to the acquisition of immunity to sand fly salivary proteins. One theoretical way to accelerate the acquisition of this immunity is to increase the density of antigen-presenting cells at the sand fly bite site. Here we describe a novel tissue platform that can be used for this purpose.\nBluePort is a well-vascularized and macrophage-rich compartment induced in the subcutaneous tissue of mice via injection of agarose beads covered with Cibacron blue. We describe the sequence of inflammatory events leading to its formation and how it can be used to study the dermal response to the bite of L. longipalpis sand flies. Results presented indicate that a shift in the inflammatory response, from neutrophilic to eosinophilic, is the main histopathological feature associated with the immunity acquired through repeated exposure to the bite of sand flies, and that the BluePort tissue compartment could be used to accelerate this process. In addition, changes observed inside the BluePort parenchyma indicate that it could be used to study complex immunobiological processes, and to develop ectopic secondary lymphoid structures.\nUnderstanding the characteristics of the dermal response to the bite of sand flies is a critical element of strategies to control leishmaniasis using vaccines that target salivary proteins. Finding that dermal eosinophilia is such a prominent component of the anti-salivary immunity induced by repeated exposure to sand fly bites raises one important consideration: how to avoid the immunological conflict derived from a protective Th2-driven immunity directed to sand fly saliva with a protective Th1-driven immunity directed to the parasite.

{"title": "Recent Advances in High-Resolution MR Application and Its Implications for Neurovascular Coupling Research.", "abstract": "The current understanding of fMRI, regarding its vascular origins, is based on numerous assumptions and theoretical modeling, but little experimental validation exists to support or challenge these models. The known functional properties of cerebral vasculature are limited mainly to the large pial surface and the small capillary level vessels. However, a significant lack of knowledge exists regarding the cluster of intermediate-sized vessels, mainly the intracortical, connecting these two groups of vessels and where, arguably, key blood flow regulation takes place. In recent years, advances in MR technology and methodology have enabled the probing of the brain, both structurally and functionally, at resolutions and coverage not previously attainable. Functional MRI has been utilized to map functional units down to the levels of cortical columns and lamina. These capabilities open new possibilities for investigating neurovascular coupling and testing hypotheses regarding fundamental cerebral organization. Here, we summarize recent cutting-edge MR applications for studying neurovascular and functional imaging, both in humans as well as in animal models. In light of the described imaging capabilities, we put forward a theory in which a cortical column, an ensemble of neurons involved in a particular neuronal computation is spatially correlated with a specific vascular unit, i.e., a cluster of an emerging principle vein surrounded by a set of diving arteries.

{"title": "Endothelial von Willebrand factor regulates angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The regulation of blood vessel formation is of fundamental importance to many physiological processes, and angiogenesis is a major area for novel therapeutic approaches to diseases from ischemia to cancer. A poorly understood clinical manifestation of pathological angiogenesis is angiodysplasia, vascular malformations that cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiodysplasia can be associated with von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common bleeding disorder in man. VWD is caused by a defect or deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein essential for normal hemostasis that is involved in inflammation. We hypothesized that VWF regulates angiogenesis. Inhibition of VWF expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in endothelial cells (ECs) caused increased in vitro angiogenesis and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-dependent proliferation and migration, coupled to decreased integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 levels and increased angiopoietin (Ang)-2 release. ECs expanded from blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells of VWD patients confirmed these results. Finally, 2 different approaches, in situ and in vivo, showed increased vascularization in VWF-deficient mice. We therefore identify a new function of VWF in ECs, which confirms VWF as a protein with multiple vascular roles and defines a novel link between hemostasis and angiogenesis.

This model predicts blood pressure, blood flow and hematocrit distributions, volumes of functional vascular territories, regional flow at voxel and network scales, etc. Using the same approach, we study flow reorganizations induced by global arteriolar vasodilations (an isometabolic global increase in cerebral blood flow). For small to moderate global vasodilations, the relationship between changes in volume and changes in flow is in close agreement with Grubb's law, providing a quantitative tool for studying the variations of its exponent with underlying vascular architecture. A significant correlation between blood flow and vascular structure at the voxel scale, practically unchanged with respect to baseline, is demonstrated. Furthermore, the effects of localized arteriolar vasodilations, representative of a local increase in metabolic demand, are analyzed. In particular, localized vasodilations induce flow changes, including vascular steal, in the neighboring arteriolar trunks at small distances (<300 \u03bcm), while their influence in the neighboring veins is much larger (about 1 mm), which provides an estimate of the vascular point spread function.

Here we examined the impact of bim deficiency on postnatal retinal vascularization, as well as retinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. Loss of bim expression was associated with increased retinal vascular density in mature animals. This was mainly attributed to increased numbers of pericytes and endothelial cells. However, the initial spread of the superficial layer of retinal vasculature and, the appearance and density of the tip cells were similar in bim+/+ and bim-/- mice. In addition, hyaloid vessel regression was attenuated in the absence of bim. Furthermore, in the absence of bim retinal vessel obliteration and neovascularization did not occur during OIR. Instead, normal inner retinal vascularization proceeded independent of changes in oxygen levels. In contrast, choroidal neovascularization occurred equally well in bim+/+ and bim-/- mice.

Therefore, oxidative phosphorylation is essential for normal \u03b2-cell function. Multiple cell types adapt to hypoxia by inducing a transcriptional programme coordinated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF activity is regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau (Vhl) protein, which targets the HIF\u03b1 subunit for proteasomal degradation in the presence of oxygen. Several recent studies have shown that Vhl deletion in \u03b2-cells results in Hif1\u03b1 activation, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and glucose intolerance. This was found to be because of alterations in \u03b2-cell gene expression inducing a switch from aerobic glucose metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis, thus disrupting the GSIS triggering pathway. Situations in which islets may become hypoxic are discussed, in particular islet transplantation which has been reported to cause islet hypoxia because of an inadequate blood supply post-transplant. Aside from this principal role for HIF in negatively regulating \u03b2-cell glucose sensing, other aspects of hypoxia signalling are discussed including \u03b2-cell differentiation, development and vascularization.

One of the most important pathologic criteria for the diagnosis of higher-grade astrocytomas (especially glioblastoma multiforme) is microvessel proliferation, particularly in the form of glomeruloid complex. Because tumor angiogenesis is a necessary factor for growth and invasiveness of malignancies, microvessel density (MVD) and intensity of angiogenesis may be used to determine the grade of astrocytomas and plan therapy accordingly.

Thin sections of tissue blocks underwent immunohistochemical staining for vwf. The stained slides were examined using a light microscope at low (100) and high (400) magnifications. MVD was estimated by calculating the mean number of stained microvessels in three areas of highest vascularization in the high-power field (400).

As the endothelial cells recover the sinusoid spaces in the cavernous tissue and because common risk factors for atherosclerosis have been frequently found in patients with erectile dysfunction, it is logical that vascular impotence presents the same pathophysiology of the other vascular diseases. They share a similar pathogenic involvement of nitric oxide pathway leading to impairment of endothelium dependent vasodilatation and structural vascular abnormalities. Circulating markers of endothelial cell damage have been reported in patients with erectile dysfunction while they have not yet presented any other vascular pathology. Endothelial progenitor cells of bone marrow origin that play a role in promoting endothelial repair are also reduced in vascular abnormalities.As penile arteries have the smallest diameter in the vascular network and because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, erectile dysfunction could be a sentinel symptom of a more generalized vascular pathology. Modifications of reversible causes or risk factors at the base of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remain the first approach toward improving endothelial function and associated with chronic exposure to PDE5-I, they could improve or even cure ED and could avoid fatal cardiovascular attacks in the future.", "journal": "Archivos espanoles de urologia", "date": "2010-11-04", "authors": ["EWespes", "C CSchulman"], "doi": null}

GCTs are highly vascularized, and angiogenic factors most probably play a role in their pathology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis, but in GCTs, the role of VEGF and its receptors VEGFR-1 (FLT1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR) remains largely unknown.

An 820-nm Ga-Al-As diode laser with an output power of 100 mW and a fiber probe with spot size of 2 mm in diameter were used for laser treatment and irradiations were performed on 5 points at the distal side of the tooth root on the first, second, and 3rd days of the experiment.

{"title": "Multiscale modeling of bone tissue with surface and permeability control.", "abstract": "Natural biological materials usually present a hierarchical arrangement with various structural levels. The biomechanical behavior of the complex hierarchical structure of bone is investigated with models that address the various levels corresponding to different scales. Models that simulate the bone remodeling process concurrently at different scales are in development. We present a multiscale model for bone tissue adaptation that considers the two top levels, whole bone and trabecular architecture. The bone density distribution is calculated at the macroscale (whole bone) level, and the trabecular structure at the microscale level takes into account its mechanical properties as well as surface density and permeability. The bone remodeling process is thus formulated as a material distribution problem at both scales. At the local level, the biologically driven information of surface density and permeability characterizes the trabecular structure. The model is tested by a three-dimensional simulation of bone tissue adaptation for the human femur. The density distribution of the model shows good agreement with the actual bone density distribution. Permeability at the microstructural level assures interconnectivity of pores, which mimics the interconnectivity of trabecular bone essential for vascularization and transport of nutrients. The importance of this multiscale model relays on the flexibility to control the morphometric parameters that characterize the trabecular structure.

{"title": "Current concepts and future directions in radioimmunotherapy.", "abstract": "Radioimmunotherapy relies on the principles of immunotherapy, but expands the cytotoxic effects of the antibody by complexing it with a radiation-emitting particle. If we consider radioimmunotherapy as a step beyond immunotherapy of cancer, the step was prompted by the (relative) failure of the latter. The conventional way to explain the failure is a lack of intrinsic killing effect and a lack of penetration into poorly vascularized tumor masses. The addition of a radioactive label (usually a \u03b2-emitter) to the antibody would improve both. Radiation is lethal and the type of radiation used (beta rays) has a sufficient range to overcome the lack of antibody penetration. At present, the most successful (and FDA approved) radioimmunotherapy agents for lymphomas are anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Rituximab (Rituxan(\u00ae)) is a chimeric antibody, used as a non-radioactive antibody and to pre-load the patient when Zevalin(\u00ae) is used.

The operation consisted of 3 stages. Before operation, the location and course of superficial temporal arteries and veins (STAV) and their frontal and parietal branches were identified with Ultrasonic Doppler blood flow detector. In stage I, STAV were dissected from the frontalis muscle as a pedicle to form a skin soft tissue space to hold the dilator of a proper size.

We found that CXCL4L1 has lower affinity for heparin and chondroitin sulfate-E than platelet factor-4 (CXCL4) and showed that CXCL10 and CXCL4L1 could displace each other on microvascular endothelial cells. Labeled CXCL4L1 also bound to CXCR3A- and CXCR3B-transfectants and was displaced by CXCL4L1, CXCL4, and CXCL10. The CXCL4L1 anti-angiogenic activity was blocked by anti-CXCR3 antibodies (Abs) in the Matrigel and cornea micropocket assays. CXCL4L1 application in CXCR3(-/-) or in wild-type mice treated with neutralizing anti-CXCR3 Abs, resulted in reduced inhibitory activity of CXCL4L1 on tumor growth and vascularization of Lewis lung carcinoma. Furthermore, CXCL4L1 and CXCL4 chemoattracted activated T cells, human natural killer cells, and human immature dendritic cells (DCs). Migration of DCs toward CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 was desensitized by preincubation with CXCL10 and CXCL11, inhibited by pertussis toxin, and neutralized by anti-CXCR3 Abs. Chemotaxis of T cells, natural killer cells, and DCs is likely to contribute to the antitumoral action. However, the in vivo data indicate that the angiostatic property of CXCL4L1 is equally important in retarding tumor growth. Thus, both CXCR3A and CXCR3B are implicated in the chemotactic and vascular effects of CXCL4L1.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2010-10-29", "authors": ["SofieStruyf", "LauraSalogni", "Marie DBurdick", "JoVandercappellen", "MiekeGouwy", "SamNoppen", "PaulProost", "GhislainOpdenakker", "MarcParmentier", "CraigGerard", "SilvanoSozzani", "Robert MStrieter", "JoVan Damme"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-11-253591"}

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a central adapter recruited to integrin \u03b21 tails in focal adhesions mediating the communication between cells and extracellular matrix. Here, we show that fibroblast-restricted inactivation of ILK in mice leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts, whereas inflammatory infiltrate and vascularization of the granulation tissue are unaffected. Primary ILK-deficient fibroblasts exhibit severely reduced levels of extracellular TGF\u03b21, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) production and myofibroblast conversion, which are rescued by exogenous TGF\u03b21. They are further characterized by elevated RhoA and low Rac1 activities, resulting in abnormal shape and reduced directional migration. Interference with RhoA-ROCK signaling largely restores morphology, migration and TGF\u03b21 levels.

{"title": "Development of the cornea of true moles (Talpidae): morphogenesis and expression of PAX6 and cytokeratins.", "abstract": "Corneal development and structure were studied in the Iberian mole Talpa occidentalis, which has permanently closed eyelids, and the European mole Talpa europaea, in which the eyes are open. The vertebrate cornea typically maintains a three-layered structure - a stratified epithelium with protective and sensory function, an avascular, hypocellular, collagenous stroma, and an endothelium with both barrier and transport functions that regulates corneal hydration, hence maintaining transparency. Compared to mouse, both mole species had significant corneal specializations, but the Iberian mole had the most divergent phenotype, with no endothelium and a flattened monolayer epithelium. Nevertheless, normal epithelial cell junctions were observed and corneal transparency was maintained. Corneas of European moles have a dysmorphic phenotype that recapitulates the human disorder keratoconus for which no mouse model exists. Mole corneas are vascularized - a situation only previously observed in the manatee Trichechus- and have non-radial patterns of corneal innervation indicative of failure of corneal epithelial cell migration. The transcription factor Pax6 is required for corneal epithelial differentiation in mice, but was found to be dispensable in moles, which had mosaic patterns of PAX6 localization uniquely restricted, in European moles, to the apical epithelial cells. The apparently stalled or abnormal differentiation of corneas in adult moles is supported by their superficial similarity to the corneas of embryonic or neonatal mice, and their abnormal expression of cytokeratin-12 and cytokeratin-5. European moles seem to have maintained some barrier/protective function in their corneas. However, Iberian moles show a more significant corneal regression likely related to the permanent eyelid fusion. In this mole species, adaptation to the arid, harder, Southern European soils could have favoured the transfer of these functions to the permanently sealed eyelids.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2010-10-29", "authors": ["F DavidCarmona", "JingxingOu", "RafaelJim\u00e9nez", "J MartinCollinson"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01299.x"}

Buck's fascia is in relation to the deep structures of the penis. The superficial fascia, dartos, is made up from a more areolar tissue and is in relation to skin and vessels. The vascularization of the deep structures comes from the common penile artery, a branch of the internal pudendal artery. Penile blood drains through three venous systems: superficial, intermediate and deep systems. Pudendal nerves are in charge of the sensitive and motor somatic innervations.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF or VEGF-A) promotion of tumor angiogenesis is thought to be mediated primarily by VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). In this study, VEGFR-2 antibody (DC101) inhibited growth of RenCa renal cell carcinoma lung metastases by 26%, whereas VEGFR-1 antibody (MF-1) had no effect. However, VEGFR-2 neutralization had no effect on RenCa liver metastases, whereas VEGFR-1 neutralization decreased RenCa liver metastases by 31%. For CT26 colon carcinoma liver metastases, inhibition of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was required to induce growth delay. VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 inhibition decreased tumor burden not by preventing the establishment of micrometastases but rather by preventing vascularization and growth of micrometastases by 55% and 43%, respectively. VEGF induced greater phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in lung ECs and of VEGFR-1 in liver ECs. EC proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation in vitro were suppressed more by VEGFR-2 inhibition for lung EC and more by VEGFR-1 inhibition for liver EC. Collectively, our results indicate that liver metastases are more reliant on VEGFR-1 than lung metastases to mediate angiogenesis due to differential activity of VEGFRs on liver EC versus lung EC.

{"title": "Modulation of CD4+ T lymphocyte lineage outcomes with targeted, nanoparticle-mediated cytokine delivery.", "abstract": "Within the immune system there is an exquisite ability to discriminate between \"self\" and \"non-self\" that is orchestrated by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Genomic plasticity enables differentiation of naive CD4+ T lymphocytes into either regulatory cells (Treg) that express the transcription factor Foxp3 and actively prevent autoimmune self-destruction or effector cells (Teff) that attack and destroy their cognate target. An example of such plasticity is our recent discovery that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) supports Treg maturation in contrast to IL-6, which drives development of the pathogenic Th17 effector phenotype. This has revealed a LIF/IL6 axis in T cell development which can be exploited for modulation using targeted cytokine delivery. Here we demonstrate that LIF-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) directed to CD4+ T cells (i) oppose IL6-driven Th17 development; (ii) prolong survival of vascularized heart grafts in mice; and (iii) expand FOXP3+ CD4+ T cell numbers in a non-human primate model in vitro. In contrast, IL-6 loaded nanoparticles directed to CD4+ T cells increase Th17 development. Notably, nanoparticle-mediated delivery was demonstrated to be critical: unloaded nanoparticles and soluble LIF or IL-6 controls failed to recapitulate the efficacy of cytokine-loaded nanoparticles in induction and/or expansion of Foxp3+ cells or Th17 cells. Thus, this targeted nanoparticle approach is able to harness endogenous immune-regulatory pathways, providing a powerful new method to modulating T cell developmental plasticity in immune-mediated disease indications.", "journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "date": "2010-10-28", "authors": ["JasonPark", "WendaGao", "RoyWhiston", "Terry BStrom", "SuMetcalfe", "Tarek MFahmy"], "doi": "10.1021/mp100203a"}

Preserving the vascular network from X-ray-induced injury is a relevant approach in the promotion of bone healing. Previously, we developed a protocol of laser preconditioning (810 nm diode laser, 36 J/cm\u00b2) prior to X-ray radiation (18.75 Gy) which protects the bone vascular network from deleterious effects of X-ray radiation. The aim of this present work is to characterize the effects of laser preconditioning on the bone through a morphological analysis of vascular parameters.\nDigital images of the vascular plexus were taken through an optical bone chamber which was implanted onto the calvaria of rabbits. Bespoke software was used for the quantification of the vessels (classified in four groups according to their diameter), vessel length, and number of nodes at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Twenty rabbits were divided into four groups: control group #1 (n\u2009=\u20095); laser group #2 (n\u2009=\u20095). X-ray radiation group #3 (n\u2009=\u20095), laser preconditioning 24 hours prior to X-ray radiation group #4 (n\u2009=\u20095).\nThe bone vascular network was stable for groups #1 and #2. Statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of each observed vascular parameter for groups #3 and #4. In the laser preconditioned group #4 the loss was less marked than in the X-ray group #3, especially for large vessels (diameter >50\u2009\u00b5m).\nWe provide in vivo microcirculatory evidence to support the concept of laser preconditioning of bone. A computer-based semi-automatic system is described to quantify superficial bone vascular network parameters that had been treated by laser preconditioning prior to X-ray radiation.

However, in retinal ischemia, pro-angiogenic factors (including vascular endothelial growth factor-A, VEGF-A) induce aberrant guidance of retinal vessels into the vitreous. Here, we show that the soluble heparan sulfate level in murine intraocular fluid is high particularly during ocular development. When the eyes of young mice with retinal ischemia were treated with heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme, the subsequent aberrant angiogenesis was greatly enhanced compared to PBS-injected contralateral eyes; however, increased angiogenesis was completely antagonized by simultaneous injection of heparin. Intraocular injection of heparan sulfate or heparin alone in these eyes resulted in reduced neovascularization. In cell cultures, the porcine ocular fluid suppressed the dose-dependent proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) mediated by VEGF-A. Ocular fluid and heparin also inhibited the migration and tube formation by these cells. The binding of VEGF-A and HUVECs was reduced under a high concentration of heparin or ocular fluid compared to lower concentrations of heparin. In vitro assays demonstrated that the ocular fluid or soluble heparan sulfate or heparin inhibited the binding of VEGF-A and immobilized heparin or VEGF receptor 2 but not VEGF receptor 1.

{"title": "Support of a free radical mechanism for enhanced antitumor efficacy of the microtubule disruptor OXi4503.", "abstract": "Unlike normal blood vessels, the unique characteristics of an expanding, disorganized and leaky tumor vascular network can be targeted for therapeutic gain by vascular disrupting agents (VDAs), which promote rapid and selective collapse of tumor vessels, causing extensive secondary cancer cell death. A hallmark observation following VDA treatment is the survival of neoplastic cells at the tumor periphery. However, comparative studies with the second generation tubulin-binding VDA OXi4503 indicate that the viable rim of tumor tissue remaining following treatment with this agent is significantly smaller than that seen for the lead VDA, combretastatin. OXi4503 is the cis-isomer of CA1P and it has been speculated that this agent's increased antitumor efficacy may be due to its reported metabolism to orthoquinone intermediates leading to the formation of cytotoxic free radicals. To examine this possibility in situ, KHT sarcoma-bearing mice were treated with either the cis- or trans-isomer of CA1P. Since both isomers can form quinone intermediates but only the cis-isomer binds tubulin, such a comparison allows the effects of vascular collapse to be evaluated independently from those caused by the reactive hydroxyl groups. The results showed that the cis-isomer (OXi4503) significantly impaired tumor blood flow leading to secondary tumor cell death and >95% tumor necrosis 24h post drug exposure.

However, the combination of the trans-isomer with combretastatin increased the antitumor efficacy of the latter agent to near that of OXi4503.

However, in most cases a high throughput technique that is simple, accurate, user-independent and cost-effective for small animal imaging is not available.\nIn this work we present a simple approach based on spectral imaging to increase the contrast between vessels and surrounding tissue, enabling accurate determination of the blood vessel area. This approach is put to test with a 4T1 breast cancer murine in vivo model and validated with histological and microvessel density analysis.\nWe found that one can accurately measure the vascularization area by using excitation/emission filter pairs which enhance the surrounding tissue's autofluorescence, significantly increasing the contrast between surrounding tissue and blood vessels. Additionally, we found excellent correlation between this technique and histological and microvessel density analysis.\nMaking use of spectral imaging techniques we have shown that it is possible to accurately determine blood vessel volume intra-vitally.

{"title": "Short-term cultivation of in situ prevascularized tissue constructs accelerates inosculation of their preformed microvascular networks after implantation into the host tissue.", "abstract": "Inosculation of preformed microvessels with the host microvasculature represents a promising approach to accelerate vascularization of tissue constructs. Herein, we analyzed whether cultivation of prevascularized tissue constructs promotes inosculation by reducing the perivascular cell coverage of the preformed microvessels. Poly(ester-urethane) scaffolds were implanted into FVB/N-TgN (Tie2/green fluorescent protein [GFP]) 287 Sato mice to generate prevascularized tissue constructs with GFP-positive microvessels. These constructs were then cultivated for 3 or 10 days before implantation into dorsal skinfold chambers of FVB/N mice to analyze inosculation and vascularization by intravital fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Noncultivated tissue constructs served as controls. Cultivation reduced the number of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive preformed microvessels within the constructs and increased the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. After 3 days of cultivation, tissue constructs still exhibited good cell viability, whereas apoptotic cell death was massively increased in the 10-day-cultivated group. After implantation, inosculation of preformed microvessels was accelerated in the 3-day-cultivated constructs. This resulted in an improved vascularization, as indicated by an increased functional microvessel density and blood perfusion. Immunohistochemical detection of GFP-positive microvessels revealed that internal and external inosculation occurs in parallel. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that inosculation of in situ prevascularized tissue constructs can be easily accelerated by destabilization of preformed microvessels and angiogenic activation during short-term cultivation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Recently mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and tantalum robust have been widely used in ANFH. They have definite cure effects but advantages and disadvantages should not be neglected.

PC markers were studied by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) and immunocytochemistry. Electrical properties of the cultured PC were investigated by patch clamp technique as well as the membrane potential sensitive dye DiBAC(4) (3).\nThe cultured cells showed typical PC morphology and were positive for NG2, alpha smooth muscle actin, PDGFR-\u03b2 and the gap junction protein Cx43. Expressions of at least one single or combinations of several markers were found in 80-90% of subpopulations. A subset of the patched cells expressed channel activities consistent with a Kv1.5 channel. In vivo presence of the channels was confirmed in sections of hamster thigh muscles. Interleukin-8, a myokine known to be released from exercising muscle, increased the expression but not the activity of this channel. Pharmacologic stimulation of the channel activity by flufenamic acid induced hyperpolarization of PC alone but not of endothelial cells [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)] alone.

It is involved in cellular resistance to stress, metabolism, differentiation, aging, and tumor suppression. SIRT1(-/-) mice demonstrate embryonic and postnatal development defects. We examined hematopoietic and endothelial cell differentiation of SIRT1(-/-) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro, and hematopoietic progenitors in SIRT1(+/+)(+/-), and (-/-) mice. SIRT1(-/-) ESCs formed fewer mature blast cell colonies. Replated SIRT1(-/-) blast colony-forming cells demonstrated defective hematopoietic potential. Endothelial cell production was unaltered, but there were defects in formation of a primitive vascular network from SIRT1(-/-)-derived embryoid bodies. Development of primitive and definitive progenitors derived from SIRT1(-/-) ESCs were also delayed and/or defective. Differentiation delay/defects were associated with delayed capacity to switch off Oct4, Nanog and Fgf5 expression, decreased \u03b2-H1 globin, \u03b2-major globin, and Scl gene expression, and reduced activation of Erk1/2. Ectopic expression of SIRT1 rescued SIRT1(-/-) ESC differentiation deficiencies. SIRT1(-/-) yolk sacs manifested fewer primitive erythroid precursors. SIRT1(-/-) and SIRT1(+/-) adult marrow had decreased numbers and cycling of hematopoietic progenitors, effects more apparent at 5%, than at 20%, oxygen tension, and these progenitors survived less well in vitro under conditions of delayed growth factor addition.

{"title": "ff1b, the SF1 ortholog, is important for pancreatic islet cell development in zebrafish.", "abstract": "The adrenal cortex and pancreatic islets have endocrine functions, producing steroid-based hormones and insulin, respectively. Cells of the adrenal cortex originate in the mesoderm while the cells of pancreatic islets originate in the endoderm. The zebrafish is a powerful model for understanding organ development due to its ease of genetic and molecular manipulation, transparent embryos, and large number of progeny for statistically powerful experiments. Like humans, the zebrafish pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions; unlike humans, there is only one endocrine islet cell group, instead of multiple islets. Using an eGFP-transgenic line of zebrafish, we have observed that the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) ortholog, ff1b, which is critical for adrenal cortex development and function in the zebrafish, is also implicated in zebrafish pancreatic islet development. We show that interruption of ff1b expression using an ff1b-morpholino (MO) disrupts development of insulin expressing cells. We conclude that ff1b-MO alters pancreatic islet development in zebrafish, demonstrating the utility of the zebrafish as a model for studying pancreatic development. This work is consistent with previous studies in mouse and human that have suggested SF1 participates in the vascular and ductal development of the pancreas, and disruption of SF1 function leads to abnormal development of the pancreatic islets due to poor vascularization.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and metabolism", "date": "2010-10-23", "authors": ["Jaime KMazilu", "Jamie WPowers", "ShuoLin", "Edward R BMcCabe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2010.09.011"}

A recent study showed that intraradicular blood flow apparently decreased during the SLR test in patients with disc herniation.\nThe study included 32 patients who underwent microdiscectomy. During the surgery, the nerve root motion affected by the hernia was observed during the SLR test. The patients' legs were allowed to hang down to the angle at which sciatica had occurred and the change of nerve root action potentials was measured. After removal of the hernia, a similar procedure was repeated. The periradicular specimens collected during surgery were examined by light and electron microscope.\nIn all patients intraoperative microscopy revealed that the hernia was adherent to the dura mater of the nerve roots. During the SLR test, the limitation of nerve root movement occurred by periradicular adhesive tissue and amplitude of action potential showed a sharp decrease at the angle that produced sciatica. After removal of the hernia, all the patients showed smooth gliding of the nerve roots during the test, and there was no marked decrease of amplitude. Our data suggest that temporary ischemic changes in the nerve root cause transient conduction disturbances.

After exposing endothelial cells to IONPs, dose-dependent effects on HUVECs viability, cytoskeleton and function were determined. Both citric acid and dextran coated particles appeared to be largely internalized by HUVECs through endocytosis and contribute to eventual cell death possibly by apoptosis. Cytoskeletal structures were greatly disrupted, as evidenced by diminished vinculin spots, and disorganized actin fiber and tubulin networks. The capacity of HUVECs to form a vascular network on Matrigel\u2122 diminished after exposure to IONPs.

Enhanced IL-6 production by CD4(+) T cells after TIM-3 blockade plays a central role in acceleration of rejection. Using an established alloreactivity TCR transgenic model, blockade of TIM-3 increased allospecific effector T cells, enhanced Th1 and Th17 polarization, and resulted in a decreased frequency of overall number of allospecific Tregs. The latter is due to inhibition in induction of adaptive Tregs rather than prevention of expansion of allospecific natural Tregs. In vitro, targeting TIM-3 did not inhibit nTreg-mediated suppression of Th1 alloreactive cells but increased IL-17 production by effector T cells. In summary, TIM-3 is a key regulatory molecule of alloimmunity through its ability to broadly modulate CD4(+) T cell differentiation, thus recalibrating the effector and regulatory arms of the alloimmune response.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2010-10-20", "authors": ["OlafBoenisch", "FrancescaD'Addio", "ToshihikoWatanabe", "WassimElyaman", "Ciara NMagee", "Melissa YYeung", "Robert FPadera", "Scott JRodig", "TakayaMurayama", "KatsunoriTanaka", "XueliYuan", "TakuyaUeno", "AnkeJurisch", "BecharaMfarrej", "HisayaAkiba", "HideoYagita", "NaderNajafian"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.0903435"}

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a novel ESS containing both genetically altered fibroblasts that express the immunosuppressive factor indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and primary keratinocytes from a nonautologous source to confer immune protection of xenogeneic cells cultured in a bilayer ESS. The results show that engraftment of IDO expressing skin substitutes on the back of rats significantly improves healing progression over 7 days compared with both nontreated and non-IDO-expressing skin substitutes (p<0.001). Immuno-staining of CD3 and CD31 suggests that IDO-expressing skin substitutes significantly suppress T cell infiltration (p<0.001) and improve neovascularization by four-fold (12.6\u00b11.2 vs. 3.0\u00b11.0 vessel-like structure/high power field), respectively.

Knockdown of miR-218 results in aberrant regulation of this signaling axis, abnormal endothelial cell migration, and reduced complexity of the retinal vasculature.\nOur findings link Slit gene expression to the posttranscriptional regulation of Robo receptors and heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes, allowing for precise control over vascular guidance cues influencing the organization of blood vessels during development.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-10-16", "authors": ["Eric MSmall", "Lillian BSutherland", "Kartik NRajagopalan", "ShushengWang", "Eric NOlson"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227926"}

Previous researches have shown that prolonged ischemia resulted in increased signs of rejection in a rat groin allotransplantation model; however, the relationship between cold ischemia and alloantigen-induced rejection was unclear.\nVascularized groin flaps were transplanted from BN to Lewis rats after 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 h of storage at 4 \u00b0C, and the allografts in each group were evaluated daily. Biopsy samples taken from the allo-0 h and allo-24 h groups on postoperative d 2-8 were graded for signs of acute rejection. Biopsy samples taken from the allo-0 h and allo-24 h groups on postoperative d 5 were stained for chemokine receptor CXCR3.\nWhen the cold ischemia time was greater than 18 h, the survival time of the grafts was significantly shorter (6.2 \u00b1 1.3 d) than that of the grafts that did not undergo cold ischemia (9.0 \u00b1 1.2 d). Histological valuation showed acceleration of activated lymphocyte infiltration in the allo-24 h group (2.2 \u00b1 0.4 d) compared with the allo-0 h group (4.8 \u00b1 0.4 d). Furthermore, the proportion of CXCR3-positive cells in the allo-24 h group (49.7% \u00b1 6.0%) was significantly higher than that in the allo-0 h group (22.9% \u00b1 3.4%) on d 5 after transplantation.\nProlonged ischemia has a deleterious effect on allograft survival, and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 may play a role in this process.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-10-12", "authors": ["BoXiao", "WeiXia", "JinZhang", "BeiLiu", "ShuzhongGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2010.08.012"}

{"title": "Engineered human tumor xenografts with functional human vascular networks.", "abstract": "Animal models of human tumor angiogenesis would have multiple applications. However, they are extremely difficult to standardize. In this work, we tried to generate human tumor xenografts containing a human vascular bed in immunodeficient mice by subcutaneous co-implantation of matrigel-embedded human endothelial cells (EC), human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a source of mural cells and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Unfortunately, in this context human EC were rapidly substituted by their murine counterparts, and by day 16 post-implantation human CD34 positive cells were hardly detectable in intratumoral vessels. In an attempt to inhibit host EC colonization of human xenografts and promote human EC grafting, we investigated the effect of radiation prior to implantation on the vascularization and growth of tumor xenografts. Nude mice underwent either localized (implantation area) or sublethal whole-body exposure to radiation. Localized radiation inhibited both human and murine neovascularization, and even the tumor growth rate was remarkably decreased when compared to control unirradiated mice and sublethally whole-body irradiated mice. Interestingly, numerous human vessels were detectable in sublethally irradiated mice at day 30, with murine EC only over passing human EC when spontaneous hematopoietic reconstitution has taken place. This observation strongly suggests the implication of bone marrow-derived murine endothelial precursors in tumor neovascularization.

Several efforts, including cellular and acellular technologies, have been made to induce vascular growth in scaffolds. However, thus far, there is no established technology for inducing vascular growth. The aim of this study was to promote the vascularization capacities of scaffolds by seeding adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on them and to compare the vascularization capacities of different scaffolds seeded with ADSCs. Two kinds of extracellular matrix scaffolds (small intestinal submucosa [SIS] and acellular dermal matrix [ADM]) and a kind of composite scaffold (collagen-chondroitin sulfate-hyaluronic acid [Co-CS-HA]) were selected. Subcutaneous implantation analysis showed that the vascularization capacity of SIS and ADM was greater than that of Co-CS-HA. ADSCs seeded in SIS and ADM secreted greater amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor than those seeded in Co-CS-HA. In a murine skin injury model, ADSC-seeded scaffolds enhanced the angiogenesis and wound healing rate compared with the nonseeded scaffolds. Moreover, ADSC-SIS and ADSC-ADM had greater vascularization capacity than that of ADSC-Co-CS-HA. Taken together, these results suggest that ADSCs could be used as a cell source to promote the vascularization capacities of scaffolds. The vascularization capacities of ADSC-seeded scaffolds were influenced by both the vascularization capacities of the scaffolds themselves and their effects on the angiogenic potential of ADSCs; the combination of extracellular matrix scaffolds and ADSCs exhibited synergistic angiogenesis promoting effects.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The main problems with this approach include pain and discomfort associated with harvesting autologous tissue, limited availability of donor sites, and the need for multiple surgeries. Although tissue engineering has great potential to provide alternative approaches for tissue regeneration, several problems have hampered progress in translating technological advances to clinical reality. Specifically, engineering of skin substitutes requires long culture times and delayed vascularization after implantation compromises graft survival. To address these issues we developed a novel two-prong strategy for tissue regeneration in vivo: (1) vascularization of acellular dermal scaffolds by infiltration of angiogenic factors; and (2) generation of stratified epidermis by in situ delivery of epidermal keratinocytes onto the prevascularized dermal support. Using athymic mouse as a model system, we found that incorporation of angiogenic factors within acellular human dermis enhanced the density and diameter of infiltrating host blood vessels. Increased vascularization correlated with enhanced proliferation and stratification of the neoepidermis originating from the fibrin-keratinocyte cell suspension. This strategy promoted tissue regeneration in vivo with no need for engineering skin substitutes; therefore, it may be useful for treatment of major wounds when skin donor sites are scarce and rapid wound coverage is required.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

However, complete eradication of PCa is unusual, and recurrent disease is evident within approximately 2 years in high-risk patients. Clinical evidence suggests that combining ADT with radiotherapy improves local control and disease-free survival in these patients compared with radiotherapy alone. We investigated whether vascularization of androgen-sensitive PCa xenografts changed after ADT and whether such therapy affected radiation response. CWR22 xenografts received combinations of ADT by castration (CWR22-cas) and 15 Gy of single-dose irradiation. At a shortest tumor diameter of 8 mm, vascularization was visualized by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging before radiation and 1 and 9 days after radiation. Voxel-wise quantitative modeling of contrast enhancement curves extracted the hemodynamic parameter K(trans), reflecting a combination of permeability, density, and blood flow. Tumor volumes and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored during the experiment. The results showed that K(trans) of CWR22-cas tumors 36\u00b14 days after ADT was 47.1% higher than K(trans) of CWR22 tumors (P = .01). CWR22-cas tumors showed no significant changes in K(trans) after radiation, whereas K(trans) of CWR22 tumors at day 1 decreased compared with pretreatment values (P = .04) before a continuous increase from day 1 to day 9 followed (P = .01).

The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells, leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor. CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling. Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis. Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration.

To establish a safe platform for adoptive immunotherapy, we first optimized the vector backbone for RNA in vitro transcription to achieve high-level transgene expression.

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in endothelial repair and vascular homeostasis. We hypothesized that hyperaldosteronism impairs EPC function and vascularization capacity in mice and humans.\nWe characterized the effects of aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade on EPC number and function as well as vascularization capacity and endothelial function. Treatment of human EPC with aldosterone induced translocation of the MR and impaired multiple cellular functions of EPC, such as differentiation, migration, and proliferation in vitro. Impaired EPC function was rescued by pharmacological blockade or genetic ablation of the MR. Aldosterone protein kinase A (PKA) dependently increased reactive oxygen species formation in EPC. Aldosterone infusion in mice impaired EPC function, EPC homing to vascular structures and vascularization capacity in a MR-dependent but blood pressure-independent manner. Endothelial progenitor cells from patients with primary hyperaldosteronism compared with controls of similar age displayed reduced migratory potential.

Data on 45 patients with SNM undergoing surgery were reviewed retrospectively. Tumour sections were analysed immunohistochemically for TAMs, microvessels, lymph vessels, and vasculogenic mimicry in both intra- and peritumoural areas. The density of intratumoural TAMs was associated with tumour thickness and with overall survival in SNM stages I and II but there were no correlations between micro- or lymph vessel density and TAM infiltration. Greater TAM infiltration was observed in tumour tissues with vasculogenic mimicry although this was not statistically significant. These data suggest that high intratumoural TAM infiltration is associated with tumour aggressiveness and a poor prognosis for SNM, and that activation of macrophages can be polarized by different micro-environments.

A transient IP decrease occurred at D2 in all treated groups, and especially in the concomitant group which exhibited a significant IP reduction compared to D0. A significant decrease in both the peak intensity and the area under the curve was observed at D4 in the group with concomitant administration of both molecules which yielded maximal inhibition of the tumor volume and the number of vessels. No correlation was found between IP values and volume or perfusion parameters, indicating complex relationships between IP and vascularization. No IP gradients were found between the center and the periphery but IP values in these two regions were significantly correlated (R\u2009=\u20090.93).\nThe results suggest that IP variations could be predictive of vascular changes and that one single IP measurement is sufficient to fully characterize the whole tumor.", "journal": "Investigational new drugs", "date": "2010-10-07", "authors": ["IngridLeguerney", "NathalieLassau", "SergeKoscielny", "M\u00e9lanieRodrigues", "ChristopheMassard", "Val\u00e9rieRouffiac", "BayaBenatsou", "JessieThalmensi", "OliviaBawa", "PauleOpolon", "PierrePeronneau", "AlainRoche"], "doi": "10.1007/s10637-010-9543-y"}

Following the recent description of TMEM127 as a new pheochromocytoma susceptibility gene, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of a causative TMEM127 gene mutation in this patient.\nPheochromocytoma susceptibility genes were analyzed in germline DNA and losses of heterozygosity (LOH) assessed by BAC array comparative genomic hybridization in tumor DNA. SDHB expression and S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Genome-wide expression microarray studies were performed, and vascular density was quantified after CD34 immunohistochemistry.\nA first germline variant was identified in the SDHB gene (c.158G>A; p.Gly53Glu). However, a positive SDHB immunostaining in the tumor indicated that this SDHB variant was a non-functional polymorphism. A novel TMEM127 germline mutation (c.140C>A, p.Ala47Asp) associated with a 2q11 LOH was found. Transcriptome and immunohistochemical analyses showed that TMEM127-related pheochromocytoma clusterized with NF1-related and RET-related tumors in a large series of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, exhibited a reduced TMEM127 mRNA expression and displayed a low vascularization. The phosphorylation of S6K observed in this tumor was suggestive of an activation of the MTOR pathway.\nPathological and genomic data demonstrated that a TMEM127 gene mutation not previously described was causative of a new case of familial bilateral pheochromocytoma.

Hydrogel architecture recapitulated the reticular distribution of human dermal matrix while maintaining flexible properties essential for skin applications. In vitro, collagen hydrogel scaffolds retained their open porous architecture and viably sustained human fibroblasts and murine mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. In vivo, hydrogel-treated murine excisional wounds demonstrated improved wound closure, which was associated with increased recruitment of stromal cells and formation of vascularized granulation tissue.

Plk3 also has a tumor-suppressing activity as aging PLK3-null mice develop tumors in multiple organs. The growth of highly vascularized tumors in PLK3-null mice suggests a role for Plk3 in angiogenesis and cellular responses to hypoxia. By studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts, we tested the hypothesis that Plk3 functions as a component in the hypoxia signaling pathway. PLK3(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts contained an enhanced level of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxic conditions. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown analyses revealed that Plk3 physically interacted with HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, but not a kinase-defective mutant, phosphorylated HIF-1\u03b1 in vitro, resulting in a major mobility shift. Mass spectrometry identified two unique serine residues that were phosphorylated by Plk3. Moreover, ectopic expression followed by cycloheximide or pulse-chase treatment demonstrated that phospho-mutants exhibited a much longer half-life than the wild-type counterpart, strongly suggesting that Plk3 directly regulates HIF-1\u03b1 stability in vivo.

Vascularized bone grafts can be obtained from a variety of donor sites, including the fibula, the iliac crest, the distal radius (corticocancellous segments and vascularized periosteum), the metacarpals and metatarsals, and the medial femoral condyle (corticoperiosteal flaps). Their vascularity is preserved as either pedicled autografts or free flaps to carry the optimum biological potential to enhance union. The grafts can also be transferred as composite tissue flaps to reconstruct compound tissue defects. Selection of the most appropriate donor flap site is multifactorial. Considerations include size matching between donor and defect, the structural characteristics of the graft, the mechanical demands of the defect, proximity to the donor area, the need for an anastomosis, the duration of the procedure, and the donor site morbidity.

Matrix metallopeptidases (MMP) contribute to spatial and temporal matrix remodeling in the bovine endometrium. In this study we observed distinct changes in expression of MMP2, MMP14, and the metallopeptidase inhibitor TIMP2 between different phases of the estrous cycle indicating an endocrine regulation. An increase of TIMP2 protein abundance was ascertained in the uterine lumen during the time of embryo elongation. The expression pattern and cellular localization correlate well with the assumed effects of MMPs on release and activation of cytokines and growth factors directing cell migration, differentiation, and vascularization during this pivotal period of development. Specifically, active MMP2 in the endometrium may determine the allocation of growth factors supporting conceptus development. The presence of a day 18 conceptus in vivo and day 8 blastoysts in vitro induced endometrial TIMP2 mRNA expression.

Placental changes (an increase in placental size and vascularization) are greater in ewes from populations that have lived for several generations at HA than in those exposed during just 1 gestation. This study investigated placental expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), 2 molecules involved in placental angiogenesis that could be upregulated by hypoxia. Two groups of ewes were maintained at HA (3589 m) during pregnancy: HA-native ewes (group HH) and ewes native to lowlands but moved to HA immediately after the diagnosis of pregnancy (group LH). A control group (LL) was kept at sea level. Near term, placentomes were removed, weighed, and processed for immunohistochemical detection of VEGF and eNOS, as well as for vascular area measurement. Placental weight was significantly higher in the HH group than in the LH and LL groups; between the latter 2 groups there was no significant difference. The placental area occupied by vasculature was significantly greater in both the HA groups than in the LH group; the number of placentomes was greatest in the LL group. The density of VEGF and eNOS in the placentome tissue was significantly greater in both HA groups than in the LL group. Although the density of VEGF was significantly lower in the HH group than in the LH group, no differences were observed in eNOS density between the HH and LH animals. These results demonstrate that chronic hypoxia upregulates the expression of placental VEGF and eNOS, suggesting an important role of these molecules in the placental response to HA hypoxia.

We found increased programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on F4/80 macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and CD11b+ CD11c+ (myeloid) dendritic cells, and increased arginase1 and Ym1 expression, typical of alternatively activated macrophages, in the draining (cervical) lymph node cells. We found accumulation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the lymph nodes draining donor hearts, suggesting a possible role of Treg induction in graft prolongation. Anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment abrogated LNFPIII-mediated the graft survival benefit and Treg accumulation. LNFPIII-treated macrophages had increased PD-L1 expression and significantly prolonged DBA/2 allograft survival when injected intraperitoneally into B6 recipient mice.\nLNFPIII prolongs fully allogeneic graft survival in both vascularized and nonvascularized allograft transplantation models. The mechanism of graft prolongation seems to involve both alternatively activated PDL-1 macrophages and recruitment of Foxp3+ Treg cells.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["ParthaDutta", "Debra AHullett", "Drew ARoenneburg", "Jose RTorrealba", "Hans WSollinger", "Donald AHarn", "William JBurlingham"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f8f296"}

{"title": "Endoscopic endonasal pituitary and skull base surgery.", "abstract": "Here we describe the procedures of endoscopic pituitary and skull base surgery in our institute. We also review the literature to reveal recent advances in this field. Endonasal approach via the sphenoid ostium was carried out for pituitary lesions without the nasal speculum. Postoperative nasal packing was basically not needed in such cases. For meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas, and giant pituitary adenomas, which required intra-dural procedures, nasal procedures such as middle nasal conchotomy and posterior ethmoidectomy, and skull base techniques such as optic canal decompression and removal of the planum sphenoidale were carried out to gain a wider operative field. Navigation and ultrasonic Doppler ultrasonography were essential. Angled endoscopes allowed more successful removal of tumors under direct visualization extending into the cavernous sinus and lower clivus. If cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage occurred during operation, the dural opening was covered with a vascularized mucoseptal flap obtained from the nasal septum. Lumbar drainage system to prevent postoperative CSF rhinorrhea was frequently not required. Angled suction tips, single-shaft coagulation tools, and slim and longer holding forceps, all of which were newly designed for endoscopic surgery, were essential for smoother procedures. Endonasal endoscopic pituitary surgery allows less invasive transsphenoidal surgery since no postoperative nasal packing and less dependence on lumbar drainage are needed. Endoscopic pituitary surgery will be more common and become a standard procedure. Endoscopic skull base surgery has enabled more aggressive removal of extrasellar tumors with the aid of nasal and skull base techniques. Postoperative CSF leakage is now under control due to novel methods which have been proposed to close the dural defect in a water-tight manner. Endoscopic skull base surgery is more highly specialized, so needs special techniques and surgical training. Patient selection is also important, which needs collaboration with ear, nose, and throat specialists. As a safe and successful procedure in skull base surgery, this complex procedure should be carried out only in specialized hospitals, which deal with many patients with skull base lesions.", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["NaokatsuSaeki", "KentaroHoriguchi", "HisayukiMurai", "YuzoHasegawa", "ToyoyukiHanazawa", "YoshitakaOkamoto"], "doi": "10.2176/nmc.50.756"}

We aimed to analyze direct responses of OVLT cells to exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1) or the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6. A primary microculture of the OVLT was established from topographically excised rat pup brain tissue, with cellular identification by marker protein-specific immunocytochemistry. Employing the ratio calcium imaging technique, pyrogen-induced calcium signaling in single OVLT cells could be characterized. LPS--as opposed to FSL-1--stimulation caused fast, transient rises in intracellular calcium concentration in 17% of neurons, 9% of astrocytes, and <5% of microglial cells investigated. LPS additionally led to enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 exclusively in microglial cells, as well as a time-dependent release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 from OVLT microcultures. TNF-\u03b1 evoked calcium signals in 11% of neurons, 22% of astrocytes, and 5% of microglial cells tested. A considerable population of neurons (11%) but only few astrocytes and microglial cells responded to IL-6, whereas 8% of microglial cells and 3% of astrocytes or neurons were activated by IL-1\u03b2.

{"title": "Hyaluronic acid/Chitosan nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for VEGF and PDGF-BB.", "abstract": "The development of a vascular network in tissue-engineered constructs is a fundamental bottleneck of bioregenerative medicine, particularly when the size of the implant exceeds a certain limit given by diffusion lengths and/or if the host tissue shows a very active metabolism. One of the approaches to achieve the vascularization of tissue constructs is generating a sustained release of proangiogenic factors from the ischemic site. This work describes the formation and characterization of hyaluronic acid-chitosan (HA/CS) nanoparticles for the delivery of two pro-angiogenic growth factors: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). These nanoparticles were prepared by an ionic gelification technique, and different formulations were developed by encapsulating the growth factors in association with two stabilizing agents: bovine serum albumin or heparin sodium salt. These carriers were characterized with regard to their physicochemical properties, their stability in biological media, and their cytotoxicity in the C3a hepatoma cell line. The results show that nanoparticles around 200\u2009nm can be prepared by this method. HA/CS nanoparticles were stable when incubated in EMEM cell culture medium or in water at 37\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. Cell culture tests confirmed that HA/CS nanoparticles are not cytotoxic within the concentration range used for growth factor delivery. Moreover, HA/CS nanoparticles were able to entrap efficiently both growth factors, reaching association values of 94% and 54% for VEGF and PDGF, respectively. In vitro release studies confirm that PDGF-BB is released from HA/CS nanoparticles in a sustained manner over approximately 1 week. On the other hand, VEGF is completely released within the first 24\u2009h.", "journal": "Drug delivery", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["YolandaParaj\u00f3", "IvanaD'Angelo", "AlexanderWelle", "MarcosGarcia-Fuentes", "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9Alonso"], "doi": "10.3109/10717544.2010.509357"}

Herein, we report a case of a 45 years old woman with chronic hepatitis B infection submitted to a right hepatectomy in May 2001 for an hepatic tumor with more than 10 cm wide, confirmed as a HCC moderately differentiated. Three years later, a solitary pulmonary metastasis was documented and a metastectomy was done. In February 2009, the patient started on sorafenib 400 mg twice daily due to an inferior mediastinal metastasis with a vena cava thrombus associated. Computed tomography (CT) scan done 13 months after revealed a consistently mass reduction in more than 50% and a clinically well patient without important collateral effects. HCC is a highly vascularized tumor and sorafenib is known to inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell survival.

A 4-dimensional STIC-HDF volume was obtained from the nondominant ovary to assess 3-dimensional (3D) vascular indices (vascularization index [VI] and flow index [FI]) during one cardiac cycle in each women. Using 1-cm(3) spherical sampling, we calculated the VI and FI from the most vascularized part of the ovarian stroma at two different moments of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole).

The mean FI values during systole (47.799 [unitless]; SD, 5.8) and diastole (47.791; SD, 6.0) were nearly identical (P = .993).

There was a high correlation between VI values during systole and diastole (r(2) = 0.94), whereas this correlation was weaker for the FI (r(2) = 0.45).\nThe STIC-HDF method allows assessment of 3D vascular indices throughout the cardiac cycle.

The body response was investigated by histological examination. It showed that the hydrogel caused an inflammatory response immediately after being implanted into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The inflammatory response was mainly exhibited as inflammatory cell surrounding and infiltrating, tissue encapsulating, and vascularization in tissue. The effects of the inflammatory response on the structure and component of the CS/GP hydrogel were extensively explored through analyzing the hydrogel samples taken by surgery. The tissue encapsulation and osmotic pressure caused the water loss of the hydrogel and the compaction of the hydrogel network, and resulted in the porosity decreasing. The cell surrounding and infiltrating spawned big pores in the network and generated the subdivision of the network.

Tube-like structures occurred along the fibres and a network was formed between neighbouring fibres. These events were promoted with increased incubation times. Biomolecule-grafted fibres created a guidance pathway that facilitated coated endothelial cells to form lumens and, from them, sprouting processes. However, there were no significant differences between the different surface modifications on fibres in terms of promoting tube-like structures.

{"title": "Functional neovascularization of biodegradable dextran hydrogels with multiple angiogenic growth factors.", "abstract": "Slow vascularization of functional blood limits the transplantation of tissue constructs and the recovery of ischemic and wounded tissues. Despite the widespread investigation of polysaccharide-based hydrogel scaffolds for their therapeutic applications, blood vessel ingrowth into these hydrogel scaffolds remains a challenge. We hypothesized that modifying the properties of biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds with immobilization of multiple angiogenic growth factors (GFs) would induce a rapid proliferation of functional vasculature into the scaffolds. To this end, we remodeled the hydrogel structure by decreasing crosslinking density via reduced degree of substitution of crosslinking groups, which resulted in improved hydrogel properties including reduced rigidity, increased swelling, increased vascular endothelial GF (VEGF) release capability, and facilitated rapid hydrogel disintegration and tissue ingrowth. Immobilizing VEGF in the scaffolds promoted tissue ingrowth and expedited biodegradation. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of multiple angiogenic GFs was established; the coimmobilization of VEGF+ angiopoietin-1, and VEGF+ insulin-like GF+ stromal cell-derived factor-1 induced more and larger blood vessels than any individual GF, while the combination of all GFs dramatically increased the size and number of newly formed functional vessels. Altogether, our data demonstrate that rapid, efficient, and functional neovascularization can be achieved by precisely manipulating hydrogel scaffold properties and immobilizing defined angiogenic GFs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["GuomingSun", "Yu-IShen", "SravantiKusuma", "KarenFox-Talbot", "Charles JSteenbergen", "SharonGerecht"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.091"}

Here, we investigated the biosynthesis and bioactions of the pro-resolving mediators lipoxin A(4) and resolvin E1 in host responses to organ transplantation. In samples obtained during screening bronchoscopy after human lung transplantation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of lipoxin A(4) were increased in association with the severity of allograft rejection that was graded independently by clinical pathology. Lipoxin A(4) significantly inhibited calcineurin activation in human neutrophils, and lipoxin A(4) stable analogs prevented acute rejection of vascularized cardiac and renal allografts. Transgenic animals expressing human lipoxin A(4) receptors revealed important sites of action in host tissues for lipoxin A(4)'s protective effects. Resolvin E1 displays counter-regulatory actions for leukocytes, in part, via increased lipoxin A(4) biosynthesis, yet RvE1 administered (1\u03bcg, iv) to donor (days -1 and 0) and recipient mice (days -1, 0 and +4) was even more potent than a lipoxin stable analog (1\u03bcg, iv) in prolonging renal allograft survival (median survival time=74.0 days with RvE1 and 37.5 days with a LXA(4) analog).

In current study, we investigated the efficacy of prevascularized TEBG for segmental defect repair. The segmental defects of 15 mm in length were created in the femurs of rabbits bilaterally. In treatment group, the osteotomy site of femur was implanted with prevascularized TEBG, which is generated by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into \u03b2-TCP scaffold, and prevascularization with the insertion of femoral vascular bundle into the side groove of scaffold; whereas in the control group, only MSC mediated scaffolds (TEBG) were implanted. The new bone formation and vascularization were investigated and furthermore, the expression of endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which might express during defect healing was evaluated, as well. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively, the treatment of prevascularized TEBG led to significantly higher volume of regenerated bone and larger amount of capillary infiltration compared to non-vascularized TEBG. The expression of VEGF in mRNA and protein levels increased with implantation time and peaked at 4 weeks postoperatively, followed by a slow decrease, however, treatment group expressed a significant higher level of VEGF than control group throughout the whole study. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that prevascularized TEBG by insertion of vascular bundle could significantly promote the new bone regeneration and vascularization compared to non-vascularized TEBG, which could be partially explained by the up-regulated expression of VEGF.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["LeWang", "HongbinFan", "Zhi-YongZhang", "Ai-JuLou", "Guo-XianPei", "ShanJiang", "Tian-WangMu", "Jun-JunQin", "Si-YuanChen", "DanJin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.036"}

{"title": "Simulation study of brain blood flow regulation by intra-cortical arterioles in an anatomically accurate large human vascular network: Part I: methodology and baseline flow.", "abstract": "Hemodynamically based functional neuroimaging techniques, such as BOLD fMRI and PET, provide indirect measures of neuronal activity. The quantitative relationship between neuronal activity and the measured signals is not yet precisely known, with uncertainties remaining about the relative contribution by their metabolic and hemodynamic components. Empirical observations have demonstrated the importance of the latter component and suggested that micro-vascular anatomy has a potential influence. The recent development of a 3D computer-assisted method for micro-vascular cerebral network analysis has produced a large quantitative library on the microcirculation of the human cerebral cortex (Cassot et al., 2006), which can be used to investigate the hemodynamic component of brain activation through fluid dynamic modeling. For this purpose, we perform the first simulations of blood flow in an anatomically accurate large human intra-cortical vascular network (~10000 segments), using a 1D non-linear model taking account of the complex rheological properties of blood flow in microcirculation. This model predicts blood pressure, blood flow and hematocrit distributions, as well as volumes of functional vascular territories, and regional flow at voxel and network scales. First, the influence of the prescribed boundary conditions (BCs) on the baseline flow structure is investigated, highlighting relevant lower- and upper-bound BCs. Independent of these BCs, large heterogeneities of baseline flow from vessel to vessel and from voxel to voxel, are demonstrated. These heterogeneities are controlled by the architecture of the intra-cortical vascular network. In particular, a correlation between the blood flow and the proportion of vascular volume occupied by arterioles or venules, at voxel scale, is highlighted. Then, the extent of venous contamination downstream to the sites of neuronal activation is investigated, demonstrating a linear relationship between the catchment surface of the activated area and the diameter of the intra-cortical draining vein.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["SLorthois", "FCassot", "FLauwers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.032"}

However, the restoration of biological functionalities by implanting bioartificially engineered tissues is still highly limited because of their lack of vascular networks. The use of proangiogenic molecules delivered from a controlled release device is a promising strategy to induce tissue vascularization. Indeed, the controlled release system can enhance the therapeutic effect in vivo of many short half-life drugs, while circumventing the need for repeated administrations. In this work, PLGA:poloxamer blend based micro- and nanoparticles have been developed for the sustained delivery of a recently developed synthetic proangiogenic compound: SHA-2-22. Drug-loaded PLGA:poloxamer blend microparticles were prepared by an oil-in-oil solvent extraction/evaporation technique. Drug-loaded PLGA:poloxamer nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent diffusion technique. These drug carriers were characterized with regard to their physicochemical properties, morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency and release kinetics in vitro. The results show that by adjusting the formulation conditions, it is possible to obtain PLGA:poloxamer micro- and nanoparticles with very high drug loadings, and with the capacity to release the active compound in a controlled way for up to one month.

{"title": "The normal menstrual cycle in women.", "abstract": "The menstrual cycle in women is characterised by high variability in cycle length (26-35 days), 5-day menses, a fertile phase from 5 days before to the day of ovulation, and low fertility which is dependent on cycle length and age. All women show an FSH rise at the luteal-follicular transition, stimulating a cohort of follicular growth and inhibin B secretion in the early follicular phase. The ovulatory dominant follicle (DF) is selected in the mid-follicular phase, and as this DF grows it increasingly secretes oestradiol and inhibin A for a week before ovulation. Gonadotrophin responsiveness, IGF binding protein expression and degradation, and vascularisation have been identified to be crucial for DF selection and progression. Two-thirds of women show two follicle waves and 1/3 show 3 follicle waves per cycle. Three-wave women have longer cycles, and a later oestradiol rise and LH surge. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, oestradiol and inhibin A in response to LH pulses, and reaches its peak in terms of size, secretions, and vascularization 6-7 days after ovulation. Luteal regression is passive and independent of the uterus, but can be prevented by hCG, the luteotrophic signal from the trophoblast, from 8 days after conception. Reductions in systemic steroid and protein hormone concentrations may be responsible for the FSH rise characteristic of premenopausal women. The functional layer of the endometrium shows steroid hormone-dependent proliferation, differentiation, and shedding in the absence of the trophoblast. Menstruation is initiated by progesterone responsive decidual cells, and executed by PGE and PGF2\u03b1, vasoconstriction and matrix metalloprotease secretion by leukocytes. Ovarian function and also hormone fluctuations during the menstrual cycle are similar to oestrous cycles of cows and mares, justifying research into comparative aspects of menstrual and oestrous cycles in monovulatory species.", "journal": "Animal reproduction science", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["MMihm", "SGangooly", "SMuttukrishna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.08.030"}

{"title": "Blood supply of the graft after cellular cardiomyoplasty.", "abstract": "Cellular cardiomyoplasty is under extensive investigation as a potential therapeutic strategy after myocardial infarction, in congestive heart failure and chronic ischemic heart disease. Various cell sources and techniques for transplantation have been studied in animal models of cardiac disease. The initial goal of replacing myocardial scar tissue by vital myocardial cells, integrated into the host, simultaneously beating and contributing to systolic force, has not yet been accomplished. However, most experimental models provided evidence for enhanced vascularization after cell transplantation. In some investigations, neovascularization was also shown to be accompanied by increased myocardial perfusion. Mechanisms by which vascularization occurs have not been fully elucidated: either the transplanted cells provide an angiogenic stimulus, involving various paracrine or hormone-like factors, which induces the formation of a new vasculature or, depending on the source of transplanted cells, the cells incorporate into the vascular network after proliferation and differentiation.

Currently, new donor pools are considered to alleviate pressure on waiting lists, such as deceased after cardiac death donors (DCD) and extended criteria donors. Because these organs are particularly sensitive to IRI, there is a need for novel preservation paradigms. We assessed the effect of anticoagulation therapy during graft preservation on IRI and graft outcome.\nIn a large white autotransplanted pig model, kidneys underwent warm ischemia for 60 min, mimicking DCD, then were preserved for 24 hr at 4\u00b0C, in University of Wisconsin solution. Animals were followed up 3 months, functional, histologic, and molecular parameters were assessed. In treated groups, antithrombin was added to collection and preservation protocols.\nTreatment improved chronic graft function, reduced tubular atrophy, and substantially increased animal survival. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis determined that markers of inflammation, such as interferon-[gamma], tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], interleukin (IL)-2, -1Rn, and -10, were significantly reduced in treated grafts. Histologic analysis revealed a lowering of CD3+ invasion. P selectin and C3 mRNA expressions were reduced in treated groups, indicative of lowered complement production and endothelial cell activation. Vascular endothelium growth factor protein expression was up-regulated, suggesting vascular network remodeling.\nInhibition of thrombin during preservation of DCD graft preserved renal integrity and function, protecting against chronic inflammation and tissue damage.

Primary human microvascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were seeded at different ratios in poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffolds enriched with basement membrane proteins (Matrigel) and implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Temporal intra-scaffold microvessel formation, anastomosis and perfusion were monitored by immunohistochemical, flow cytometric and in vivo multiphoton fluorescence microscopy analysis. Vascularization in the tissue-engineering context was strongly enhanced in implants seeded with a complete complement of blood vessel components: human microvascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo assembled a patent microvasculature within Matrigel-enriched PLLA scaffolds that anastomosed with the host circulation during the first week of implantation. Multiphoton fluorescence angiographic analysis of the intra-scaffold microcirculation showed a uniform, branched microvascular network. 3D image reconstruction analysis of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (hPASMC) distribution within vascularized implants was non-random and displayed a preferential perivascular localization.

Pathological examination showed a rosette-forming low grade tumor with a cell proliferation rate of 2% being consistent with RGNT. The postoperative course was uneventful and clinical symptoms resolved completely. There was no tumor recurrence after 2 years follow-up. We confirm that the rare and only recently characterized tumor entity of RGNT can also be found in elderly patients; furthermore, it can be associated with a benign course.

Although many algorithms have been reported in literature for this problem, those that are applicable to various density types have not been available until recently. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that is applicable to solid, non-solid and part-solid types and solitary, vascularized, and juxtapleural types. First, the algorithm separates lung parenchyma and radiographically denser anatomical structures with coupled competition and diffusion processes. The technique tends to derive a spatially more homogeneous foreground map than an adaptive thresholding based method. Second, it locates the core of a nodule in a manner that is applicable to juxtapleural types using a transformation applied on the Euclidean distance transform of the foreground. Third, it detaches the nodule from attached structures by a region growing on the Euclidean distance map followed by a procedure to delineate the surface of the nodule based on the patterns of the region growing and distance maps. Finally, convex hull of the nodule surface intersected with the foreground constitutes the final segmentation. The performance of the technique is evaluated with two Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) data sets with 23 and 82 nodules each, and another data set with 820 nodules with manual diameter measurements.

Preliminary soft tissue expansion may prevent such perfusion disturbances caused by stretching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using self-inflating expanders at different rates to expand overlying soft tissue prior to the bone grafting procedure.\nTwo different hydrogel expanders with different inflation curves were used. For the experiments, 48 Lewis rats were divided into six groups of eight animals each. In four groups, the different expanders were implanted subperiosteally on the calvarium. In two of these groups, an observation window was implanted for intravital microscopy. In the other two groups, histologic analysis of the covering skin was performed. Intravital microscopy of the unexpanded periosteum and histologic analyses of unoperated rats served as control groups.\nFollowing implantation of the expanders, intravital microscopic examinations showed that, irrespective of the expansion curve, periosteal microcirculation had stopped completely without reperfusion within 14 days. Histologic analyses of the soft tissues, however, showed a well-vascularized connective tissue layer clinging to the expander. The microvessel density measured was significantly higher above slowly inflating expanders (91.2 \u00b1 8.8 vessels/mm\u00b2) than above rapidly inflating expanders (48.4 \u00b1 2.7 vessels/mm\u00b2) or unoperated periosteum (60.4 \u00b1 4.8 vessels/mm\u00b2).\nSubperiosteal implantation of self-inflating expanders leads to complete ischemia of the periosteum.

Gold beads were percutaneously implanted via a needle into different locations surrounding the greater trochanter of the femur. Nine dogs with implants were necropsied. In all examined animals, characteristic histologic lesions were observed in the tissue surrounding the gold implants--namely, a fibrous capsule composed of concentric fibroblasts intermixed with a variable number of inflammatory cells and a paucicellular innermost layer of collagen with a few fibrocyte-like cells in empty lacunae. Lymphocytes dominated the inflammatory infiltrate, with rarely observed macrophages present in close proximity to the implant site. No giant cells were observed. Immunohistochemistry showed mixed populations of lymphocytes, both CD3 positive (T cells) and CD79a positive (B cells), which in some cases formed lymphoid follicles. Diffuse inflammatory changes were present to a minor extent in the perimysium and surrounding fascia. The inflammation observed in dogs is similar to that observed with gold implants in humans. It is possible that the clinically beneficial effect of gold beads for chronic osteoarthritis depends on sustained localized inflammation with localized release of soluble mediators.

{"title": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is secreted by rhabdomyosarcoma cells, modulates tumor metastasis by binding to CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors and inhibits recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts.", "abstract": "The overexpression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been observed in many tumors and is implicated in oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. MIF activates CXCR2 and CD74 receptors and, as recently reported, may also bind to the stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-binding receptor CXCR4. Here, we report that human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines secrete MIF and that this chemokine (a) induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p42/44 and AKT, (b) stimulates RMS cell adhesion, (c) enhances tumor vascularization, but surprisingly (d) decreases recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Because RMS cells used in our studies do not express CXCR2 and CD74 receptors, the biological effects of MIF on RMS cells depend on its interaction with CXCR4, and as we report here for the first time, MIF may also engage another SDF-1-binding receptor (CXCR7) as well. Interestingly, downregulation of MIF in RMS cells inoculated into immunodeficient mice led to formation of larger tumors that displayed higher stromal cell support. Based on these observations, we postulate that MIF is an important autocrine/paracrine factor that stimulates both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors to enhance the adhesiveness of RMS cells. We also envision that when locally secreted by a growing tumor, MIF prevents responsiveness of RMS to chemoattractants secreted outside the growing tumor (e.g., SDF-1) and thereby prevents release of cells into the circulation. On the other hand, despite its obvious proangiopoietic effects, MIF inhibits in CXCR2/CD74-dependent manner recruitment of CAFs to the growing tumor. Our data indicate that therapeutic inhibition of MIF in RMS may accelerate metastasis and tumor growth.", "journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "date": "2010-09-24", "authors": ["MaciejTarnowski", "KatarzynaGrymula", "RuiLiu", "JoannaTarnowska", "JustynaDrukala", "JaninaRatajczak", "Robert AMitchell", "Mariusz ZRatajczak", "MagdaKucia"], "doi": "10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0288\n10.1002/ijc.25245\n10.1189/jlb.0310182"}
{"title": "Effects of plasma viscosity modulation on cardiac function during moderate hemodilution.", "abstract": "Previous studies have found that increasing plasma viscosity as whole blood viscosity decrease has beneficial effects in microvascular hemodynamics. As the heart couples with systemic vascular network, changes in plasma and blood viscosity during hemodilution determine vascular pressure drop and flow rate, which influence cardiac function. This study aimed to investigate how changes in plasma viscosity affect on cardiac function during acute isovolemic hemodilution.\nPlasma viscosity was modulated by hemodilution of 40% of blood volume with three different plasma expanders (PEs). Dextran 2000 kDa (Dx2M, 6.3 cP) and dextran 70 kDa (Dx70, 3.0 cP) were used as high and moderate viscogenic PEs, respectively. Polyethylene glycol conjugated with human serum albumin (PEG-HSA, 2.2 cP) was used as low viscogenic PE. The cardiac function was assessed using a miniaturized pressure-volume conductance catheter.\nAfter hemodilution, pressure dropped to 84%, 79%, and 78% of baseline for Dx2M, Dx70 and PEG-HSA, respectively. Cardiac output markedly increased for Dx2M and PEG-HSA. Dx2M significantly produced higher stroke work relative to baseline and compared to Dx70.\nAcute hemodilution with PEG-HSA without increasing plasma viscosity provided beneficial effects on cardiac function compared to Dx70, and similar to those measured with Dx2M. Potentially negative effects of increasing peripheral vascular resistance due to the increase in plasma viscosity were prevented.", "journal": "Asian journal of transfusion science", "date": "2010-09-23", "authors": ["SurapongChatpun", "PedroCabrales"], "doi": "10.4103/0973-6247.67034"}

{"title": "Diclofenac inhibits tumor growth in a murine model of pancreatic cancer by modulation of VEGF levels and arginase activity.", "abstract": "Diclofenac is one of the oldest anti-inflammatory drugs in use. In addition to its inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX), diclofenac potently inhibits phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), thus yielding a broad anti-inflammatory effect. Since inflammation is an important factor in the development of pancreatic tumors we explored the potential of diclofenac to inhibit tumor growth in mice inoculated with PANCO2 cells orthotopically.\nWe found that diclofenac treatment (30 mg/kg/bw for 11 days) of mice inoculated with PANC02 cells, reduced the tumor weight by 60%, correlating with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Since this effect was not observed in vitro on cultured PANCO2 cells, we theorized that diclofenac beneficial treatment involved other mediators present in vivo. Indeed, diclofenac drastically decreased tumor vascularization by downregulating VEGF in the tumor and in abdominal cavity fluid. Furthermore, diclofenac directly inhibited vascular sprouting ex vivo. Surprisingly, in contrast to other COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac increased arginase activity/arginase 1 protein content in tumor stroma cells, peritoneal macrophages and white blood cells by 2.4, 4.8 and 2 fold, respectively. We propose that the subsequent arginine depletion and decrease in NO levels, both in serum and peritoneal cavity, adds to tumor growth inhibition by malnourishment and poor vasculature development.\nIn conclusion, diclofenac shows pronounced antitumoral properties in pancreatic cancer model that can contribute to further treatment development. The ability of diclofenac to induce arginase activity in tumor stroma, peritoneal macrophages and white blood cells provides a tool to study a controversial issue of pro-and antitumoral effects of arginine depletion.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2010-09-22", "authors": ["NinaMayorek", "NiliNaftali-Shani", "MyriamGrunewald"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0012715"}

This two-layer configuration is a realistic model for biological tissues in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges, where the upper layer may be an epithelial layer and the lower layer is a vascularized stroma layer. Application of the model yields estimates for tissue parameters, such as the thickness of the upper layer or the absorption properties of the lower layer.

The allure of providing an exact replica of a missing bone that incorporates to become indistinguishable from self, has the capacity to heal and grow, is resistant to infection, and with minimal morbidity is a \"holy grail\" to all surgeons who work with bone. This is a report of a 14-year-old adolescent boy with Treacher Collins syndrome whose bilateral orbitozygomatic defects were treated with engineered bone made from a combination of human bone allograft, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, bone morphogenic protein-2, and periosteal grafts.

He had slight lid malposition postoperatively as well but has had no long-term negative effects from the surgery. His reconstruction has remained stable during a 6-month follow-up, and a recent biopsy of the engineered bone demonstrated healthy, lamellar bone. These data are the first to demonstrate revitalization of large volume allograft bone in humans and have positive implications for craniofacial bone tissue engineering.

Earlier studies have shown its association with inhibition of tumor metastasis. However, its function in malignant tumors is not fully enunciated. Recently there was increasing evidence that NDRG1 is involved in stress responses. In the current study, we examined the expression of NDRG1 and its correlation with clinicopathological factors and microvessel density (MVD) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC).

However, the number of EPCs for cell therapy is limited. In this study, instead of the typical adherent culture method, we investigated a more efficient, clinically applicable nonadhesive expansion method for early EPCs using cord blood-derived cells to overcome rapid cellular senescence. After a suspension culture of isolated CD34(+) cells in serum-free medium containing each cytokine combination was maintained for 9 d, the number of expanded functional EPCs was assessed by an adherent culture assay. Compared to mononuclear cells, the CD34(+) fraction was superior in its expansion of functional EPCs that could differentiate into acLDL/UEA-1(+) cells without significant cellular senescence, whereas the CD34(-) fraction showed no EPC expansion. Among the cytokine combinations tested for the CD34(+) fraction, a combination (SFIb) consisting of stem cell factor (SCF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, interleukin-3, and basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in a reproducible 64- to 1468-fold EPC expansion from various cord blood origins. Interestingly, the SFIb combination displayed markedly increased EPC expansion (2.43-fold), with a higher percentage of CD34(+) cells (2.17-fold), undifferentiated blasts (2.38-fold) and CXCR4(+) cells (1.68-fold) compared to another cytokine combination (SCF, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), although the two cytokine combinations had a similar level of total mononucleated cell expansion (\u223c 10% difference). Accordingly, the cells expanded in the SFIb combination were more effective in recovery of blood flow and neovascularization in hind-limb ischemia in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the nonadhesive serum-free culture conditions of the CD34(+) fraction provide an effective EPC expansion method for cell therapy, and an expansion condition leading to high percentages of CD34(+) cells and blasts is likely important in EPC expansion.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2010-09-21", "authors": ["EunjuO", "Byung HunLee", "Hyun-YoungAhn", "Jong-ChulShin", "Hyun-KyungKim", "MyungshinKim", "In-YangPark", "Yong-GyuPark", "Young AeJoe"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.10-162040"}

During the last three decades, this non-invasive skin imaging method has been extended to dermatology. High-frequency ultrasonography with higher than 20MHz scanners is well-established for measuring tumour thickness and skin thickness when treating inflammatory skin diseases such as scleroderma or psoriasis. High-frequency ultrasonography has become extremely helpful for the preoperative assessment of skin melanoma. The correlation between ultrasonic and histological measurements of melanomas thickness is significantly similarly good using transducers of 20, 75 or 100MHz frequency (r range from 0.895 to 0.99) and better compared with transducers of 7.5MHz frequency (r=0.76). The preoperative sonographically estimated thickness of skin melanoma is sometimes overestimated, because of an underlying inflammatory infiltrate and other reasons. Assessment of skin melanoma thickness using transducers of 100MHz frequency has better agreement with histology, compared with ultrasonography with 20MHz transducers. However, the ultrasonic penetration depth is limited to 1.5mm in case of 100MHz. The newer ultrasonic techniques such as high-frequency ultrasonography and colour Doppler sonography could be used for assessment of the tumour vascularization and its metastatic potential.

{"title": "Pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease.", "abstract": "In this article, the present status of neurosurgical operations for Cushing's disease is briefly reviewed. Transsphenoidal surgery is considered the treatment of choice in most patients with Cushing's disease once the diagnosis has been established. In a considerable proportion of patients, even sophisticated imaging does not directly depict the tiny microadenoma. The search for the tumor is technically difficult, particularly when the sella turcica is small, the dura vascularized and the sphenoid sinus poorly pneumatized. Thus, even in expert hands, microadenomas cannot always be identified intraoperatively. Usually, a selective adenomectomy is attempted, preserving pituitary functions. There is a huge variation of surgical outcomes reported. As an estimate, a remission rate of some 75% can be expected 5 years after surgery. Almost all data available to date derive from microsurgical operations. Unfortunately, even in patients who initially remit, recurrences may occur. Low postoperative serum cortisol levels and a long-lasting adrenocortical insufficiency seem to be factors associated with a favorable long-term outcome. When no distinct microadenoma can be identified intraoperatively, partial or even total hypophysectomy has been suggested. However, the outcome of these procedures is less favorable than with selective resections of distinct adenomas. Less than 10% of pituitary adenomas associated with Cushing's disease are macroadenomas. These also bear a less favorable outcome than microadenomas. Only for selected patients with mainly extrasellar tumor localizations are craniotomies recommended. A close cooperation with the endocrinologist is mandatory for a neurosurgeon operating on patients with Cushing's disease, namely for the pre- and perioperative care and for long-term follow-up.", "journal": "Neuroendocrinology", "date": "2010-09-21", "authors": ["MichaelBuchfelder", "SvenSchlaffer"], "doi": "10.1159/000314223"}

Gonads were collected from mice expressing LacZ driven by the Kdr promoter (KDR-LacZ) from embryonic day 11 (E11) through postnatal day 60 (P60). At E11.5, mesonephric cells expressing KDR-LacZ seemed to migrate into the developing testis and surrounded developing seminiferous cords. Cells expressing KDR-LacZ appeared in the ovary with no apparent migration from the adjacent mesonephros, suggesting a different origin of endothelial cells. Testis organ cultures from E11 mice were treated with 8\u00a0\u03bcM VEGFR-TKI, a vascular endothelial growth factor\u00a0A signal transduction inhibitor; subsequently, the amount of KDR-LacZ staining was reduced by 66%-99% (P<0.002), and the ability of KDR-expressing cells to form a densely organized vascular network was inhibited. Novel non-angiogenic KDR-LacZ staining was detected in the testis on specific subsets of germ cells at E16, E17, P4, P20, P30, and P60. In ovaries, staining was present on oocytes within oocyte cysts at E17 and within late secondary follicles of postnatal mice. Thus, KDR is an excellent marker for analyzing vascular development in the gonads. Inhibition of VEGFA signal transduction prevents the development of testis-specific vasculature. Furthermore, non-vascular KDR-LacZ staining suggests that KDR directly affects both spermatogenesis and somatic-oocyte interactions during gametogenesis.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2010-09-18", "authors": ["Rebecca CBott", "Debra TClopton", "Anna MFuller", "Ryann MMcFee", "NingxiaLu", "Renee MMcFee", "Andrea SCupp"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-010-1038-9"}

The diaphyseal canals were detected by monochromatic synchrotron radiation CT with a 3.1-\u03bcm voxel resolution. The anatomical properties of the canal network were compared between age- or size-matched hypoxic and normoxic groups. The canals were larger in diameter, were more densely distributed and connected, and opened into the marrow cavity with a higher density in hyp-4 than in cnt-4. The canal density and connectivity were also higher in hyp-4 than in cnt-3. The canal diameter, density, and connectivity were smaller in hyp-8 than in cnt-4; however, the densities of endocortical and periosteal canal openings did not differ between hyp-8 and cnt-4.

We then examined the possible role of DKK1 in tumor neovasculogenesis and found that blood vessels of breast cancer tissues expressed DKK1 far more strongly in human breast tumors than in normal breast tissues. By studying 62 human breast tumors, we found a significant positive correlation between DKK1 expression and von Willebrand factor.

{"title": "Roles of tetrahydrobiopterin in promoting tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), which is derived from endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), provides crucial signals for angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an absolute requirement for eNOS activity. In this study, we investigated whether this activation is both maintained by a wild-type Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-positive feedback loop in endothelial cells and affects tumor angiogenesis. We found that supplementation of BH4 (via the pterin salvage pathway with Sep) increased Akt/eNOS phosphorylation in both human eNOS-transfected COS-7 cells and endothelial cells concomitant with increases in NO production, cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. This augmentation was abrogated by a PI3K inhibitor. Sepiapterin (Sep) also increased GTP-bound wild-type Ras and PI3K/Akt/eNOS activation, which was prevented by the eNOS inhibitor, N\u03c9-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Furthermore, expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I (the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BH4 synthesis) under doxycycline control potentiated in vivo tumorigenesis, tumor cell proliferation, as well as angiogenesis. Conversely, both switching off GTP cyclohydrolase I expression as well as inhibiting its enzymatic activity significantly decreased eNOS expression and tumor vascularization. This study demonstrates an important role for BH4 synthesis in angiogenesis by the activation of eNOS for NO production, which is maintained by a PI3K/Akt-positive feedback loop through effects on wild-type Ras in endothelial cells.

Although the critical importance and remodeling capacity of the blood vasculature has been well described within the ovary, just a few reports describe the lymphatic vasculature. Using histological and molecular techniques, we report the kinetics of ovarian lymphangiogenesis and the hormonal regulation of lymphangiogenic growth factors associated with key stages of ovarian follicle growth. We exploited the Adamts1-null mouse model, a model with a previously characterized lymphatic defect to further interrogate the mechanisms controlling ovarian lymphangiogenesis. The establishment and development of the ovarian lymphatic vascular network in postnatal developing ovaries was associated with the presence and hormonal regulation of the lymphangiogenic growth factors and their receptors, including Vegfc, Vegfd, and Vegfr3. We characterized the hormonally regulated remodeling of the ovarian lymphatic vasculature in response to FSH and estradiol. The lymphatic network was defective in the Adamts1-null ovary, clearly demonstrating both the involvement of FSH/estradiol and the Adamts1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1) protease in ovarian lymphangiogenesis.

In this condition, bone within the radiation field becomes devitalized and exposed through the overlying skin or mucosa, persisting as a non-healing wound for three months or more. In 1926, Ewing first recognized the bone changes associated with radiation therapy and described them as \"radiation osteitis\". In 1983, Marx proposed the first staging system for ORN that also served as a treatment protocol. This protocol advocated that patients whose disease progressed following conservative therapy (hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), local wound care, debridement) were advanced to a radical resection with a staged reconstruction utilizing a non-vascularized bone graft. Since the introduction of Marx's protocol, there have been advances in surgical techniques (i.e. microvascular surgery), as well as in imaging techniques, which have significantly impacted on the diagnosis and management of ORN. High resolution CT scans and orthopantamograms have become a key component in evaluating and staging ORN, prior to formulating a treatment plan. Patients can now be stratified based on imaging and clinical findings, and treatment can be determined based on the stage of disease, rather than determining the stage of disease based on a patient's response to a standardized treatment protocol. Reconstructions are now routinely performed immediately after resection of the diseased tissue rather than in a staged fashion.

The design of bio-packages for MEMS to be implanted into the human body has been an increasing challenge in the last years. Mechanical, chemical and thermal resistance, as well as excellent bonding to silicon surfaces, are needed. Furthermore, ideal bio-packages should minimize post-operative complications and be well accepted by the host. To reach this goal, two different morphology-controlled hydroxyapatite-based porous biomaterials were synthesized, implanted in rats and evaluated mechanically and histologically. The novel biomaterials were prepared at room temperature using synthetic hydroxyapatite micro-particles, silica nanoparticles and water-based resin and compared with a standard hydroxyapatite biomaterial. The morphology (porosity) was controlled to obtain interconnected pores with appropriated pore size and pore volume fraction. All biomaterials were implanted in rats at the dorsal area near the third thoracic vertebra. The rats were killed 2, 7 and 21 days after surgery. Histological analysis revealed that the implants were well accepted by the host and minimal local inflammation was observed. The acute inflammatory response disappeared 21 days after surgery for both novel biomaterials. Additionally, organic matter (collagen) was produced in the interior of the porous biomaterial, indicating that an incipient vascularization process was in progress after 21 days of implantation.

Reduced lens movement was associated with inflammatory events with subjects more likely to develop inflammatory events compared with those wearers with optimal lens movement (p = 0.027).\nA multitude of factors, including environmental influences, lens contamination, ocular characteristics, and lens fit, contributes to the development of inflammatory events, information that is of clinical relevance to practitioners worldwide.

Especially wound healing is of concern because after SM exposure, wound healing is prolonged. In this study, we focused on the effect of SM (30 and 100\u03bcM) on endothelial tube formation, apoptosis, and proliferation in mouse embryoid bodies (EBs), which provide an appropriate model for investigating vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. EBs were exposed to SM for 30 min on day 0, 3, or 6 of EBs' growth, were allowed to grow until day 7, then fixed, and immunostained (PECAM-1, Ki67, and activated caspase-3). SM significantly decreased endothelial tube formation compared with unexposed EBs. Additionally, we observed a significant increase of apoptosis. As the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of SM toxicity, we evaluated the effect of ROS scavengers (\u03b1-linolenic acid [ALA] and N-acetyl cysteine [NAC]) in the same experimental setup. Temporary effects of both scavengers could be detected, in particular NAC seemed to have temporary significant positive effects on endothelial tube formation in 100\u03bcM SM-exposed EBs. ALA augmented proliferation when administered after 30\u03bcM SM exposure on day 3, whereas NAC treatment on day 0 decreased apoptosis induced by 100\u03bcM SM. Taken together, our findings pointed to a negative effect of SM on vascularization and endothelial tube formation.

Although existing imaging technique can provide vessel images, microvessels will not be discerned without the use of contrast agents. Furthermore, conventional imaging technique can only provide the outline of the vessels due to the restriction of spatial resolution. In this study, a novel imaging technique, diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), is applied to the observation of microvessels in mouse hepatic fibrosis samples. With high spatial resolution and contrast of biological soft tissues, DEI is a non-invasive synchrotron-based imaging technique and does not require contrast agents. Particularly, this article highlights the exploration of the objects inside microvessels. A segment of blood vessel, which is obstructed by a blood clot, is under quantitative assessment and the result provides a precise description of vessel stenosis. Additionally, as one of the application of the diffraction enhanced imaging, blood stream simulation is carried out on the three-dimensional model of the vessel.

A rapid placental vascularization observed in the second half of pig pregnancy is positively correlated with the mRNA expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that VEGF may have a stimulatory effect in the dynamically growing UC. To further understand the role of the VEGF-VEGFR system during UC development, mRNA and protein expression as well as the cellular localization of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in UC were examined on days 40, 60, 75 and 90 of pregnancy and after physiological delivery in the pig (day 114 of pregnancy). Real Time RT-PCR analysis showed an increase in the mRNA levels of VEGF120 and VEGF164 from day 90 of pregnancy. VEGFR-1 mRNA expression was significantly increased on day 75 of pregnancy. No significant changes in VEGFR-2 mRNA expression were detected. In turn, western blot analysis revealed an increase in VEGF-A protein expression on day 40, compared to the later days of pregnancy. A rapid increase in the VEGFR-1 protein level was noted on day 75 and 90 of gestation. No significant changes in VEGFR-2 protein expression were detected on any of the analysed days of pregnancy.

Less than 10% of GBM patients survive >5 years after diagnosis. Angiogenesis plays an important role in GBM growth, and antiangiogenesis-based therapies have shown clinical efficacy for GBM patients. Unfortunately, therapeutic resistance often develops in these patients, suggesting that GBM cells are capable of switching their dependency on one proangiogenic signaling pathway to an alternative one. Therefore, it is important to identify novel angiogenic factors that play essential roles in tumor angiogenesis and GBM progression. Angiopoietins (Ang-1, Ang-2, and Ang-4) are the ligands of the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The roles of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in tumor angiogenesis have been established. However, little is known about how Ang-4 affects tumor angiogenesis and GBM progression and the mechanism underlying its effects. In our current study, we establish that Ang-4 is upregulated in human GBM tissues and cells. We show that, like endothelial cells, human GBM cells express Tie-2 RTK. We first establish that Ang-4 promotes in vivo growth of human GBM cells by promoting tumor angiogenesis and directly activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) in GBM cells. Our results establish the novel effects of Ang-4 on tumor angiogenesis and GBM progression and suggest that this pro-GBM effect of Ang-4 is mediated by promoting tumor angiogenesis and activating Erk1/2 kinase in GBM cells.

Although these zones have been demonstrated in many frequently ruptured tendons, the existence of a similar area in the often ruptured long head of biceps (LHB) tendon is largely unknown. Twenty cadaveric upper limb specimens were dissected after injection with either a radio-opaque lead oxide/milk mixture or India ink, followed by histological sectioning of the tendons. The LHB tendon was consistently supplied via its osteotendinous and musculotendinous junctions by branches of the thoracoacromial and brachial arteries respectively. In two specimens, additional branches from the anterior circumflex humeral artery travelling in a mesotenon vascularized the midsection of tendon. These source arteries divided the LHB tendon into either two or three vascular territories, depending upon the presence of the mesotenon-derived vascular supply. A zone of hypovascularity was consistently found in the region of the LHB tendon most frequently prone to rupture. This zone covered an area 1.2-3 cm from the tendon origin, extending from midway through the glenohumeral joint to the proximal inter-tubercular groove. This hypovascular region occurred on the border of two adjacent vascular territories, where reduced caliber choke vessels provide limited arterial supply.

{"title": "Ketones and lactate \"fuel\" tumor growth and metastasis: Evidence that epithelial cancer cells use oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.", "abstract": "Previously, we proposed a new model for understanding the \"Warburg effect\" in tumor metabolism. In this scheme, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis and the resulting energy-rich metabolites are then transferred to epithelial cancer cells, where they enter the TCA cycle, resulting in high ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. We have termed this new paradigm \"The Reverse Warburg Effect.\" Here, we directly evaluate whether the end-products of aerobic glycolysis (3-hydroxy-butyrate and L-lactate) can stimulate tumor growth and metastasis, using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts as a model system. More specifically, we show that administration of 3-hydroxy-butyrate (a ketone body) increases tumor growth by \u223c2.5-fold, without any measurable increases in tumor vascularization/angiogenesis. Both 3-hydroxy-butyrate and L-lactate functioned as chemo-attractants, stimulating the migration of epithelial cancer cells. Although L-lactate did not increase primary tumor growth, it stimulated the formation of lung metastases by \u223c10-fold. Thus, we conclude that ketones and lactate fuel tumor growth and metastasis, providing functional evidence to support the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\". Moreover, we discuss the possibility that it may be unwise to use lactate-containing i.v. solutions (such as Lactated Ringer's or Hartmann's solution) in cancer patients, given the dramatic metastasis-promoting properties of L-lactate. Also, we provide evidence for the up-regulation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism and the TCA cycle in human breast cancer cells in vivo, via an informatics analysis of the existing raw transcriptional profiles of epithelial breast cancer cells and adjacent stromal cells. Lastly, our findings may explain why diabetic patients have an increased incidence of cancer, due to increased ketone production, and a tendency towards autophagy/mitophagy in their adipose tissue.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["GloriaBonuccelli", "AristotelisTsirigos", "DianaWhitaker-Menezes", "StephanosPavlides", "Richard GPestell", "BarbaraChiavarina", "Philippe GFrank", "NealFlomenberg", "AnthonyHowell", "Ubaldo EMartinez-Outschoorn", "FedericaSotgia", "Michael PLisanti"], "doi": "10.4161/cc.9.17.12731"}
{"title": "Autophagy-induced regression of hyaloid vessels in early ocular development.", "abstract": "The hyaloid vessel is a transient intraocular circulatory system that undergoes a complete regression as the retina becomes matured with retinal vascularization. If the complete involution of the hyaloid vessels fails, the pathological persistence of these vessels results in persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) associated with severe ocular pathologies. Unfortunately, despite its clinical significance, cellular and molecular processes involved in hyaloid regression remain to be elucidated. Herein, we for the first time demonstrated that autophagy could contribute to the regression of hyaloid vessels in early-developing retina. In developing retina, hyaloid vessel regression coincided with retinal vascular development; this occurred simultaneous with apoptotic and autophagic processes. Moreover, in vascular endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions, LC3-II conversion was detected along with caspase-3 activation. The autophagy inducer rapamycin induced autophagy-mediated cell death of vascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, rapamycin significantly enhanced the involution of hyaloid vessels in the early developing eye. Therefore, our results suggest that the autophagy pathway would be involved in hyaloid regression that occurs during early ocular development. Furthermore, activation of the autophagy pathway could be considered for a therapeutic approach to PHPV.", "journal": "Autophagy", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["Jeong HunKim", "Jin HyoungKim", "Young SukYu", "Ji YoungMun", "Kyu-WonKim"], "doi": "10.4161/auto.6.8.13306"}

As prescribing proper boundary conditions can affect the solutions of the equations governing blood flow, in this study, we investigated the influence to assumptions regarding the outflow boundary conditions in an image-based CFD model of human carotid bifurcation. Four simulations were conducted with identical geometry, inlet flow rate, and fluid parameters. In the first case, a physiological time-varying flow rate partition at branches along the cardiac cycle was obtained by coupling the 3D model of the carotid bifurcation at outlets with a lumped-parameter model of the downstream vascular network. Results from the coupled model were compared with those obtained by imposing three fixed flow rate divisions (50/50, 60/40, and 70/30) between the two branches of the isolated 3D model of the carotid bifurcation. Three hemodynamic wall parameters were considered as indicators of vascular wall dysfunction. Our findings underscore that the overall effect of the assumptions done in order to simulate blood flow within the carotid bifurcation is mainly in the hot-spot modulation of the hemodynamic descriptors of atherosusceptible areas, rather than in their distribution. In particular, the more physiological, time-varying flow rate division deriving from the coupled simulation has the effect of damping wall shear stress (WSS) oscillations (differences among the coupled and the three fixed flow partition models are up to 37.3% for the oscillating shear index). In conclusion, we recommend to adopt more realistic constraints, for example, by coupling models at different scales, as in this study, when the objective is the outcome prediction of alternate therapeutic interventions for individual patients, or to test hypotheses related to the role of local fluid dynamics and other biomechanical factors in vascular diseases.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["UmbertoMorbiducci", "DiegoGallo", "DianaMassai", "FilippoConsolo", "RaffaelePonzini", "LucaAntiga", "CristinaBignardi", "Marco ADeriu", "AlbertoRedaelli"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4001886"}

Biomechanical properties, biocompatibility, and also cost effectiveness and clinical practicability are factors for the selection of a particular material. A promising alternative seems to be screws and plates made of bone. Recently, xenogenic bone pins and screws have been invented for use in joint surgery. In this study, screws made of allogenic sheep and xenogenic human bone were analyzed in a vital and dynamic sheep-model and compared to conventional titanium screws over a standard period of bone healing of 56 days with a constant applied extrusion force. Biomechanical analysis and histomorphological evaluation were performed. After 56 days of insertion xenogenic screws made of human bone showed significantly larger distance of extrusion of on average 173.8 \u03bcm compared to allogenic screws made of sheep bone of on average 27.8 and 29.95 \u03bcm of the titanium control group. Severe resorption processes with connective tissue interposition were found in the histomorphological analysis of the xenogenic screws in contrast to new bone formation and centripetal vascularization of the allogenic bone screw, as well as in processes of incorporation of the titanium control group. The study showed allogenic cortical bone screws as a substantial alternative to titanium screws with good biomechanical properties.

The increasing number and broadening geography of participants, the emergence of new exciting bioprinting technologies, and the attraction of young investigators indicates the strong growth potential of this emerging field. Bioprinting can be defined as the use of computer-aided transfer processes for patterning and assembling living and non-living materials with a prescribed 2D or 3D organization in order to produce bio-engineered structures serving in regenerative medicine, pharmacokinetic and basic cell biology studies. The use of bioprinting technology for biofabrication of in vitro assay has been shown to be a realistic short-term application. At the same time, the principal feasibility of bioprinting vascularized human organs as well as in vivo bioprinting has been demonstrated. The bioprinting of complex 3D human tissues and constructs in vitro and especially in vivo are exciting, but long-term, applications.

Although the highest incidence of moyamoya disease is in pediatric patients, pathology reports have been primarily limited to adult samples and describe occlusive fibrocellular lesions in the intimae of affected arteries. We describe the case of a young girl with primary moyamoya disease who presented at 18 months of age with right hemiparesis following an ischemic stroke. Angiography showed stenosis of the distal left ICA, left middle cerebral artery, and right ICA. An emergent left-sided dural inversion was performed. Recurrent strokes and alternating hemiplegia necessitated a right dural inversion 6 months later. Nonetheless, her aggressive disease proved uniquely refractory to surgical revascularization, and she succumbed to recurrent strokes and neurological deterioration at 2.5 years of age. Pathological specimens revealed a striking bilateral occlusion of the anterior carotid circulation resulting from intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Most strikingly, the ascending aorta and the superior mesenteric artery demonstrated similar intimal proliferation, along with SMC proliferation in the media.

Currently no therapy for MPS IVA is available. We produced recombinant human (rh)GALNS as a potential enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing GALNS and sulfatase modifying factor-1 were used to produce active ( approximately 2 U/mg) and pure (>or=97%) rhGALNS. The recombinant enzyme was phosphorylated and was dose-dependently taken up by mannose-6-phosphate receptor (K(uptake) = 2.5 nM), thereby restoring enzyme activity in MPS IVA fibroblasts. In the absence of an animal model with a skeletal phenotype, we established chondrocytes isolated from two MPS IVA patients as a disease model in vitro. MPS IVA chondrocyte GALNS activity was not detectable and the cells exhibited KS storage up to 11-fold higher than unaffected chondrocytes. MPS IVA chondrocytes internalized rhGALNS into lysosomes, resulting in normalization of enzyme activity and decrease in KS storage. rhGALNS treatment also modulated gene expression, increasing expression of chondrogenic genes Collagen II, Collagen X, Aggrecan and Sox9 and decreasing abnormal expression of Collagen I. Intravenous administration of rhGALNS resulted in biodistribution throughout all layers of the heart valve and the entire thickness of the growth plate in wild-type mice. We show that enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GALNS results in clearance of keratan sulfate accumulation, and that such treatment ameliorates aberrant gene expression in human chondrocytes in vitro.

{"title": "Nonlinear modelling of cancer: bridging the gap between cells and tumours.", "abstract": "Despite major scientific, medical and technological advances over the last few decades, a cure for cancer remains elusive. The disease initiation is complex, and including initiation and avascular growth, onset of hypoxia and acidosis due to accumulation of cells beyond normal physiological conditions, inducement of angiogenesis from the surrounding vasculature, tumour vascularization and further growth, and invasion of surrounding tissue and metastasis. Although the focus historically has been to study these events through experimental and clinical observations, mathematical modelling and simulation that enable analysis at multiple time and spatial scales have also complemented these efforts. Here, we provide an overview of this multiscale modelling focusing on the growth phase of tumours and bypassing the initial stage of tumourigenesis. While we briefly review discrete modelling, our focus is on the continuum approach. We limit the scope further by considering models of tumour progression that do not distinguish tumour cells by their age. We also do not consider immune system interactions nor do we describe models of therapy. We do discuss hybrid-modelling frameworks, where the tumour tissue is modelled using both discrete (cell-scale) and continuum (tumour-scale) elements, thus connecting the micrometre to the centimetre tumour scale. We review recent examples that incorporate experimental data into model parameters. We show that recent mathematical modelling predicts that transport limitations of cell nutrients, oxygen and growth factors may result in cell death that leads to morphological instability, providing a mechanism for invasion via tumour fingering and fragmentation. These conditions induce selection pressure for cell survivability, and may lead to additional genetic mutations. Mathematical modelling further shows that parameters that control the tumour mass shape also control its ability to invade.

With the application of nondestructive contrast imaging pulse sequences combined with a clearance-refill approach, it is possible to create quantitative time-to-refill maps of tissue correlating to blood perfusion rate. One limitation to standard two-dimensional (2D) perfusion imaging is that the narrow elevational beamwidth of 1- or 1.5-D ultrasound transducers provides information in only a single slice of tissue, and thus it is difficult to image exactly the same plane from study to study. We hypothesize that inhomogeneity in vascularization, such as that common in many types of tumors, makes serial perfusion estimates inconsistent unless the same region can be imaged repeatedly. Our objective was to evaluate error in 2D quantitative perfusion estimation in an in vivo sample volume because of differences in transducer positioning. To mitigate observed errors due to imaging plane misalignment, we propose and demonstrate the application of quantitative 3-dimensional (3D) perfusion imaging. We also evaluate the effect of contrast agent concentration and infusion rate on perfusion estimates.\nContrast-enhanced destruction-reperfusion imaging was performed using parametric mapping of refill times and custom software for image alignment to compensate for tissue motion. Imaging was performed in rats using a Siemens Sequoia 512 imaging system with a 15L8 transducer. A custom 3D perfusion mapping system was designed by incorporating a computer-controlled positioning system to move the transducer in the elevational direction, and the Sequoia was interfaced to the motion system for timing of the destruction-reperfusion sequence and data acquisition. Perfusion estimates were acquired from rat kidneys as a function of imaging plane and in response to the vasoactive drug dopamine.\nOur results indicate that perfusion estimates generated by 2D imaging in the rat kidney have mean standard deviations on the order of 10%, and as high as 22%, because of differences in initial transducer position. This difference was larger than changes in kidney perfusion induced by dopamine. With application of 3D perfusion mapping, repeatability in perfusion estimated in the kidney is reduced to a standard deviation of less than 3%, despite random initial transducer positioning. Varying contrast agent administration rate was also observed to bias measured perfusion time, especially at low concentrations; however, we observed that contrast administration rates between 2.7 \u00d7 10(8) and 3.9 \u00d7 10(8) bubbles/min provided results that were consistent within 3% for the contrast agent type evaluated.\nThree-dimensional perfusion imaging allows a significant reduction in the error caused by transducer positioning, and significantly improves the reliability of quantitative perfusion time estimates in a rat kidney model.

HS is covalently attached to core proteins to form HS-proteoglycans. Most of the functions of HS-proteoglycans are mediated by their HS moieties. The biosynthesis of HS is initiated by chain polymerization and is followed by stepwise modification reactions, including sulfation and epimerization. These modifications generate ligand-binding sites that modulate cell functions and activities of proteinases and/or proteinase inhibitors. HS is abundantly expressed in developing and mature vasculature, and understanding its roles in vascular biology and related human diseases is an area of intense investigation. In this chapter, we summarize the significant recent advances in our understanding of the roles of HS in developmental and pathological angiogenesis with a major focus on studies using transgenic as well as gene knockout/knockdown models in mice and zebrafish. These studies have revealed that HS critically regulates angiogenesis by playing a proangiogenic role, and this regulatory function critically depends on HS fine structure. The latter is responsible for facilitating cell-surface binding of various proangiogenic growth factors that in turn mediate endothelial growth signaling. In cancer, mouse studies have revealed important roles for endothelial cell-surface HS as well as matrix-associated HS, wherein signaling by multiple growth factors as well as matrix storage of growth factors may be regulated by HS. We also discuss important mediators that may fine-tune such regulation, such as heparanase and sulfatases; and models wherein targeting HS (or core protein) biosynthesis may affect tumor growth and vascularization. Finally, the importance of targeting HS in other human diseases wherein angiogenesis may play pathophysiologic (or even therapeutic) roles is considered.", "journal": "Progress in molecular biology and translational science", "date": "2010-09-03", "authors": ["Mark MFuster", "LianchunWang"], "doi": "10.1016/S1877-1173(10)93009-3"}

The most commonly used antihyperlipidemic drugs are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), of which atorvastatin is one of the most widely used. Little is known about the relationship between tendinopathy and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) or the effects of atorvastatin use on tendon healing following surgical repair of tendon rupture. We hypothesized that atorvastatin negatively affects this healing process. The Achilles tendons of 16 New Zealand rabbits were ruptured surgically and repaired with sutures. Eight of the rabbits were given oral atorvastatin. The other 8 served as a surgical control group. Six weeks postoperatively, all the rabbits were sacrificed, and the repaired tendons were removed. After standard histological preparation, fibroblastic activity, re-vascularization, collagenization, collagen construction, and inflammatory-cell infiltration were evaluated. On comparing the atorvastatin and surgical control groups, we observed no difference in fibroblastic activity.

However, recent evidence of physiological uncoupling between neuronal and cerebrovascular events highlights the need for methods to simultaneously measure these three properties. We report a multimodality optical approach that integrates dual-wavelength laser speckle imaging (measures changes in blood flow, blood volume and hemoglobin oxygenation), digital-frequency-ramping optical coherence tomography (images quantitative 3D vascular network) and Rhod(2) fluorescence (images intracellular calcium for measure of neuronal activity) at high spatiotemporal resolutions (30 \u03bcm, 10 Hz) and over a large field of view (3\u00d75 mm(2)). We apply it to assess cocaine's effects in rat cortical brain and show an immediate decrease (3.5\u00b10.9 min, phase 1) in the oxygen content of hemoglobin and the cerebral blood flow followed by an overshoot (7.1\u00b10.2 min, phase 2) lasting over 20 min whereas Ca(2+) increased immediately (peaked at t=4.1\u00b10.4 min) and remained elevated. This enabled us to identify a delay (2.9\u00b10.5 min) between peak neuronal and vascular responses in phase 2. The ability of this multimodality optical approach for simultaneous imaging at high spatiotemporal resolutions permits us to distinguish the vascular versus cellular changes of the brain, thus complimenting other neuroimaging modalities for brain functional studies (e. g., PET, fMRI).", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2010-09-02", "authors": ["ZhijiaYuan", "ZhongchiLuo", "Nora DVolkow", "YingtianPan", "CongwuDu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.045"}

Exercise regimens enhance blood perfusion, neo-vascularization, and neurogenesis in nervous system structures associated with learning and memory. The impact of specific plastic changes to learning and memory performance in exercising animals are not well understood. The current experiment was designed to investigate the contributions of angiogenesis and neurogenesis to learning and memory performance by pharmacologically blocking each process in separate groups of exercising animals prior to visual spatial memory assessment. Results from our experiment indicate that angiogenesis is an important component of learning as animals receiving an angiogenesis inhibitor exhibit retarded Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition. Interestingly, our results also revealed that neurogenesis inhibition improves learning and memory performance in the MWM. Animals that received the neurogenesis inhibitor displayed the best overall MWM performance.

We have previously shown that the zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1) enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA decay through its interaction with AU-rich elements within VEGF 3'-untranslated region. In this study, we evaluated the possibility to develop an antiangiogenic and antitumoral strategy using the mRNA-destabilizing activity of ZFP36L1. We engineered a cell-penetrating ZFP36L1, by fusing it to the protein transduction domains (PTDs) TAT derived from HIV, or the polyarginine peptides R7 or R9. PTD-ZFP36L1 fusion proteins were expressed in bacterial cells and affinity-purified to homogeneity. TAT-, R7- and R9-ZFP36L1 were efficiently internalized into living cells and decreased both endogenous VEGF mRNA half-life and VEGF protein levels in vitro. Importantly, a single injection of R9-TIS11b fusion protein into a high-VEGF expressing tissue in vivo (in this study, the mouse adrenal gland) markedly decreased VEGF expression. We further evaluated the effect of R9-ZFP36L1 on tumor growth using Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LL/2) cells implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Intratumoral injection of R9-ZFP36L1 significantly reduced tumor growth and markedly decreased the expression of multiple angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines, including VEGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 and IL-6, with a concomitant obliteration of tumor vascularization. These findings indicate that R9-ZFP36L1 fusion protein may represent a novel antiangiogenic and antitumoral agent, and supports the emerging idea that modulation of mRNA stability represents a promising therapeutic approach to treat cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2010-08-31", "authors": ["SPlanel", "ASalomon", "PJalinot", "J-JFeige", "NCherradi"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2010.341"}

Promoting angiogenesis and vascular stability through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), respectively, provides a possible therapeutic approach in treating SCI. We examined whether supplementing the injured environment with these two factors, which are significantly reduced following injury, has an effect on lesion size and functional outcome.

Our results indicate that the combined treatment with VEGF and Ang-1 resulted in both reduced hyperintense lesion volume and vascular stabilization, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Western blot analysis indicated that the viral vector expression was maintained into the chronic phase of injury, and that the use of the AAV vectors did not exacerbate infiltration of microglia into the lesion epicenter.

We applied optical clearing to minimize the random light scattering in the mouse pancreatic tissue. The optical-cleared pancreas allowed penetrative, 3-D microscopic imaging of the islet microstructure and vasculature. Specifically, the islet vasculature was revealed by vessel painting-lipophilic dye labeling of blood vessels-for confocal microscopy. The voxel-based confocal micrographs were digitally processed with projection algorithms for 3-D visualization. Unlike the microtome-based tissue imaging, this optical method for penetrative imaging of mouse islets yielded clear, continuous optical sections for an integrated visualization of the islet microstructure and vasculature with subcellular-level resolution.

The purpose of the current study was to identify mechanisms responsible for heparanase induction. We provide evidence that heparanase expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by sequences at the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the gene. Constructing the 3' UTR immediately following the heparanase cDNA reduces heparanase enzymatic activity and protein levels, resulting in decreased cellular invasion capacity. We further identified a 185-bp sequence within the 3' UTR that mediates heparanase down-regulation, and characterized an adenine (A)/uracil (U)-rich consensus element (ARE) within this region. Deletion of the entire 185-bp region or the ARE eliminated the inhibitory effect of the 3' UTR, resulting in elevated heparanase levels and formation of larger tumor xenografts indistinguishable from those produced by heparanase-overexpressing cells in terms of size, vascularization, and Akt activation.

In a wound healing assay, macrophage recruitment was decreased in Notch1(+/-) mice, and the wounds were characterized by decreased TNF-\u03b1 expression. As wound healing progressed, Notch1(+/-) wounds had increased vascularization and collagen deposition compared with wild-type wounds. In mice with myeloid-specific Notch1 deletion, wounds had decreased macrophage recruitment as well as decreased TNF-\u03b1 expression, indicating the specific role of Notch1 in the inflammatory response in these cells. In vitro, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) was upregulated in macrophages in response to LPS/IFN-\u03b3 and that this upregulation depended on Notch signaling. Furthermore, macrophages from Notch1(+/-) mice had decreased expression of VEGFR-1 compared with macrophages from wild-type mice, whereas VEGFR-1 expression in Notch4(-/-) macrophages was normal. Inhibition of Notch signaling decreased induction of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, CXCL10, MCP-1, monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages in response to LPS/IFN-\u03b3. Additionally, macrophages from Notch1(+/-) mice demonstrated decreased induction of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 in response to stimulation compared with wild-type mice.

Through the use of this serum-free, defined system, we demonstrate that pericyte motility within 3D collagen matrices is dependent on the copresence of ECs. Using either soluble receptor traps consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ErbB4 receptors or blocking antibodies directed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, or heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), we show that both of these EC-derived ligands are required to control pericyte motility, proliferation, and recruitment along the EC tube ablumenal surface. Blockade of pericyte recruitment causes a lack of basement membrane matrix deposition and, concomitantly, increased vessel widths. Combined inhibition of PDGF-BB and HB-EGF-induced signaling in quail embryos leads to reduced pericyte recruitment to EC tubes, decreased basement membrane matrix deposition, increased vessel widths, and vascular hemorrhage phenotypes in vivo, in support of our findings in vitro.

The level of proangiogenic growth factors and inflammatory mediators with proangiogenic activity is known to be elevated in AD brains which has led to the supposition that the cerebrovasculature of AD patients is in a proangiogenic state. However, angiogenesis depends on the balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors and the brains of AD patients also show an accumulation of endostatin and Abeta peptides which have been shown to be antiangiogenic. To determine whether angiogenesis is compromised in the brains of two transgenic mouse models of AD overproducing Abeta peptides (Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice), we assessed the growth and vascularization of orthotopically implanted murine gliomas since they require a high degree of angiogenesis to sustain their growth. Our data reveal that intracranial tumor growth and angiogenesis is significantly reduced in Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice compared with their wild-type littermates. In addition, we show that Abeta inhibits the angiogenesis stimulated by glioma cells when cocultured with human brain microvascular cells on a Matrigel layer.

Our data indicate that the angiogenic response of the host differs significantly between the upper and lower sites in the mouse abdomen and reveal that the expansion of tumor mass is restricted to sites with low angiogenic responses, such as the bowel mesentery in the lower abdomen. We show that, in this model, this suppression of angiogenesis is due to an expression gradient of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor. Mice with a targeted deletion of TSP-1 no longer show regional restriction of tumor growth. The physiologic relevance of these findings may be seen in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, whereby tumors spread within the peritoneal cavity and show differential growth in the upper and lower abdomen.

The current study evaluated the potential for microvascular constructs to maintain a vascularized tissue environment around an implanted biomaterial. An analysis of the peri-implant tissue around bare expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), ePTFE embedded within a microvascular construct, or ePTFE embedded within collagen alone revealed that the presence of the MVC, but not collagen alone, promoted vascular densities comparable to that of the granulation tissue formed around bare ePTFE. The vessels within the microvascular construct surrounding the ePTFE were perfusion competent, as determined by India ink perfusion casting, and extended into the interstices of the polymer. In contrast to bare ePTFE, the presence of the MVC or collagen alone significantly reduced the number of activated macrophages in association with ePTFE. Similar results were observed for ePTFE modified to increase cellularity and prevent the formation of an avascular scar.

Sonographically determined tumor localization and extent were compared with magnetic resonance imaging and histology.\nThe median tumor size in the 20 rats determined on US (2.3 mm) and magnetic resonance imaging (2.4 mm) showed a very high correlation (r = 0.92, P = 0.01). Both agent A and agent B demonstrated higher vascularization of tumor periphery compared with normal prostate (P < 0.05) based on contrast inflow and areas under the curve analysis. Twenty minutes after administration, luminance for agent B in the tumor was significantly higher (P = 0.003) compared with nonspecific agent A (11.8-0.1). In consensus reading, the increase in signal intensity of the tumor compared with normal prostate tissue was significantly higher for agent B (P = 0.005), whereas no significant difference was found for agent A (P = 0.180).\nThe target-specific contrast agent was superior to the unspecific US contrast agent both with regard to early inflow analysis and specific accumulation in prostate cancer after 20 minutes.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["ThomasFischer", "AnkeThomas", "IsabellTardy", "MichelSchneider", "HanaH\u00fcnigen", "PiaCustodis", "DirkBeyersdorff", "JohannaPlendl", "J\u00f6rgSchnorr", "FelixDiekmann", "OleGemeinhardt"], "doi": "10.1097/RLI.0b013e3181efd6b2"}

Consequently, its early diagnosis and treatment improve prognosis. Thyroid hormone measurement in either fetal serum or amniotic fluid implies important risks. Here we present a fetal goiter and the follow-up procedure, both done by the traditional method and by using 3-dimensional power Doppler (3DPD) imaging and virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL).\nA single well-documented case of fetal goiter was followed weekly from 22 weeks until delivery. Amniocentesis for thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (T(4)) measurement as well as levothyroxine injections were performed at every control. In addition to amniocentesis, every control involved a sonographic evaluation, which included standard measurements of the gland and the capture of volume image sets in gray scale and 3DPD. Volume calculation of the gland was done using VOCAL software. Vascularization of the gland was evaluated by the vascularization index (VI) included in the software.\nWith treatment, TSH levels decreased progressively until normalization. Free T(4) levels increased toward the end of gestation. Sonographic measurements of the gland volume to estimated fetal weight ratio decreased across treatment as levels of TSH did. The VI clearly depicted the vascular regression of the goiter, decreasing throughout treatment in a consistent way until 24 hours before delivery.\nGray scale and 3DPD evaluations of the thyroid gland have been validated under similar circumstances and might be reliable complements to the invasive methods used in the management of this fetal condition.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["Rodrigo CuevasMar\u00edn", "Juan CarlosBello-Mu\u00f1oz", "Gabriel Villag\u00f3mezMart\u00ednez", "Silvia Ar\u00e9valoMart\u00ednez", "Elena CarrerasMoratonas", "Lluis CaberoRoura"], "doi": "10.7863/jum.2010.29.9.1339"}
{"title": "Dynamics of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell/mesenchymal stem cell interaction in co-culture and its implications in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering aims to regenerate tissues and organs by using cell and biomaterial-based approaches. One of the current challenges in the field is to promote proper vascularization in the implant to prevent cell death and promote host integration. Bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are bone marrow resident stem cells widely employed for proangiogenic applications. In vivo, they are likely to interact frequently both in the bone marrow and at sites of injury. In this study, the physical and biochemical interactions between BM-EPCs and MSCs in an in vitro co-culture system were investigated to further clarify their roles in vascularization. BM-EPC/MSC co-cultures established close cell-cell contacts soon after seeding and self-assembled to form elongated structures at 3days. Besides direct contact, cells also exhibited vesicle transport phenomena. When co-cultured in Matrigel, tube formation was greatly enhanced even in serum-starved, growth factor free medium. Both MSCs and BM-EPCs contributed to these tubes. However, cell proliferation was greatly reduced in co-culture and morphological differences were observed. Gene expression and cluster analysis for wide panel of angiogenesis-related transcripts demonstrated up-regulation of angiogenic markers but down-regulation of many other cytokines. These data suggest that cross-talk occurs in between BM-EPCs and MSCs through paracrine and direct cell contact mechanisms leading to modulation of the angiogenic response.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["AAguirre", "J APlanell", "EEngel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.08.073"}

In addition, we measured the VEGF and NO content in cell culture supernatants to analyse their production by AF-MSCs.\nAF-MSCs were obtained from women with foetal DS and controls matched for age and gestation, and expanded in culture. The cells were then evaluated for the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and NOS isoforms, as well as for the release of VEGF and NO.\nOur analyses showed that both the VEGF expression and production were significantly lower in DS-AF-MSCs with respect to the controls. As regards NOS, immunohistochemical expression of eNOS was significantly reduced in DS-AF-MSCs, whereas the nNOS and iNOS were similarly immunoexpressed in both groups of cells. Moreover, we observed that the NO content was significantly higher in medium derived by DS-AF-MSCs.\nOur study shows, for the first time, the differences between AF-MSCs isolated from control and trisomy 21 pregnancies and suggest an involvement of NO and VEGF in the physiopathological mechanisms associated with DS pregnancy.", "journal": "European journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["EleonoraSalvolini", "MoniaOrciani", "GuendalinaLucarini", "AriannaVignini", "Andrea LuigiTranquilli", "RobertoDi Primio"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02370.x"}

Members of one protease class, the cysteine cathepsins, have received increasing recognition for their involvement in cancer development, and numerous clinical studies have reported correlations between elevated cathepsin levels and malignant progression. This is also the case for cathepsin H, a member of the cysteine cathepsin family, and its utility as a prognostic marker has been analyzed extensively. However, there is limited information available on its specific functions in tumor development and progression. To gain further insight into the role of this protease in cancer, we crossed cathepsin H-deficient mice with the RIP1-Tag2 model of pancreatic islet carcinogenesis. Deletion of cathepsin H significantly impaired angiogenic switching of the pre-malignant hyperplastic islets and resulted in a reduction in the subsequent number of tumors that formed. Moreover, the tumor burden in cathepsin H null RT2 mice was significantly reduced, in association with defects in the blood vasculature and increased apoptosis. Thus, we demonstrate here for the first time important tumor-promoting roles for cathepsin H in vivo using a mouse model of human cancer.", "journal": "Biological chemistry", "date": "2010-08-25", "authors": ["VasilenaGocheva", "XiaopingChen", "ChristophPeters", "ThomasReinheckel", "Johanna AJoyce"], "doi": "10.1515/BC.2010.080"}

{"title": "Mast cells have a protumorigenic role in human thyroid cancer.", "abstract": "In different human carcinoma types, mast cell infiltrate increases with respect to normal tissue and mast cell density correlates with a bad prognosis. To assess the role of mast cells in human thyroid cancer, we compared the density of tryptase-positive mast cells in 96 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) versus normal thyroid tissue from 14 healthy individuals. Mast cell density was higher in 95% of PTCs (n=91) than in control tissue. Mast cell infiltrate correlated with extrathyroidal extension (P=0.0005) of PTCs. We show that thyroid cancer cell-line-derived soluble factors induce mast cell activation and chemoattraction in vitro. Different mast cell lines (HMC-1 and LAD2) and primary human lung mast cells induced thyroid cancer cell invasive ability, survival and DNA synthesis in vitro. The latter effect was mainly mediated by three mast-cell-derived mediators: histamine, and chemokines CXCL1/GRO\u03b1 and CXCL10/IP10. We show that xenografts of thyroid carcinoma cells (8505-C) could recruit mast cells injected into the tail vein of mice. Co-injection of human mast cells accelerated the growth of thyroid cancer cell (8505-C) xenografts in athymic mice. This effect was mediated by increased tumor vascularization and proliferation, and was reverted by treating mice with sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn), a specific mast cell inhibitor. In conclusion, our study data suggest that mast cells are recruited into thyroid carcinomas and promote proliferation, survival and invasive ability of cancer cells, thereby contributing to thyroid carcinoma growth and invasiveness.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2010-08-24", "authors": ["R MMelillo", "VGuarino", "EAvilla", "M RGaldiero", "FLiotti", "NPrevete", "F WRossi", "FBasolo", "CUgolini", "Ade Paulis", "MSantoro", "GMarone"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2010.348"}

Since VEGF and their receptors are expressed by tumour cells, we hypothesised that Bvz, in addition to its impact on neo-vascularisation, could have an impact on tumour cells and enhance the DXL activity. Hence, we studied the effect of DXL and Bvz on metastatic breast (MDA MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells lines. Bvz alone did not decrease cell proliferation but in combination with DXL, Bvz enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of DXL. Other anti-angiogenic factors Sunitinib, Sorafenib and Gefitinib enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of DXL. qPCR experiments showed that DXL significantly increased the VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) mRNA levels. Activation of VEGF and VEGF-R2 promoters demonstrated that enhanced mRNA levels are partly due to transcriptional activation. ELISA assays showed that DXL induced accumulation of cytoplasmic VEGF but decreased extracellular levels by 39% (MDA) and 48% (PC3). Cell surface localisation of VEGF-R2 was increased by DXL alone, but decreased after combined treatment of DXL plus Bvz. Abnormal expression of VEGF-R2 was also shown on breast and prostate tumour samples reinforcing the results obtained on cellular models. In conclusion, DXL and Bvz in combination decreased extracellular VEGF and VEGF-R2 levels at the plasma membrane thereby blocking an important growth/survival loop. Thus, the combined therapeutic impact of Bvz and DXL observed in clinical trials is associated with enhanced anti-proliferative activity and inhibition of the vascular network.", "journal": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "date": "2010-08-24", "authors": ["C\u00e9cileOrtholan", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meDurivault", "Jean-MichelHannoun-Levi", "M\u00e9lanieGuyot", "ChristineBourcier", "DamienAmbrosetti", "StephenSafe", "GillesPag\u00e8s"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2010.07.021"}

These defects were treated in emergency (four cases) or scheduled for an autograft of costal cartilage harvested from the ninth rib. Four digits showed lesions of the extensor system which were repaired. One digit grafted after complete amputation was no more vascularized. All patients were reviewed and prospectively followed-up by the surgeons and were also reviewed by an independent operator 16.1 months post-surgery in average (9-25). No infection occurred. None of the grafted fingers had to undergo arthrodesis or secondary amputation. One case of type 1 complex regional pain syndrome occurred.

Intentional placement of regenerating tissue at the site of tumor resection raises questions concerning the possibility of promoting cancer recurrence. Here we review coculture and animal models of tumor/mesenchymal stem cell interactions under regenerating conditions. Available evidence from case reports, cell lines, and clinical isolates favors the interpretation that regenerating tissue promotes the growth of active, high-grade tumor.

Dorsal skinfold chambers were implanted into 48 balb/c mice, which were assigned to 6 groups (n = 8 each). Uncoated (controls), collagen-coated, and additionally VEGF-loaded PLGA and \u00df-TCP scaffolds were inserted into the chambers. Angiogenesis, neovascularization, and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction were analyzed repeatedly during a 14-day observation period using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, VEGF release from PLGA und \u00df-TCP scaffolds was studied by ELISA. Micromorphology was studied from histological specimens. Unloaded \u00df-TCP scaffolds showed an accelerated and increased angiogenic response when compared with unloaded PLGA scaffolds. In vitro, PLGA released significantly higher amounts of VEGF compared with \u00df-TCP at the first two days resulting in a rapid drop of the released amount at the following days up to day 7 where the VEGF release was negligible. Nonetheless, in vivo VEGF loading increased neovascularization, especially in \u00df-TCP scaffolds. This increased vascularization was associated with a temporary leukocytic response with pronounced leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction at days 3 and 6. Histology revealed adequate host tissue response and engraftment of both \u00df-TCP and PLGA scaffolds.

However, the technique, as first described, cannot be applied in gigantomastia or severe breast ptosis cases or cases of dense parenchyma of the breast. The senior surgeon suggested an intraoperative modification of the Pitanguy method of reduction mammaplasty to make it applicable for such cases.\nA retrospective study of 122 patients with severe breast ptosis (70), gigantomastia (45), or dense breast parenchyma (7) who underwent a modification of the Pitanguy method was performed. The current procedure involves all the operating steps of the superior pedicle technique as described by Pitanguy, from the marking technique to the keel resection of the breast. If the nipple-areola complex is elevated inadequately, the surgeon can use the senior surgeon's modification to elevate the complex to the desired height. This modification consists of dissecting the upper pole of the breast vertically to the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle and laterally to the nipple-areola complex. The medial flap is then advanced superiorly, rotated 90\u00b0, and sutured to point A, while the lateral flap is placed below the medial one.

{"title": "Histone deacetylases: anti-angiogenic targets in cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Judah Folkman was the first in 1971 to observe and report that cancer growth and dissemination were dependent on angiogenesis - the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature. For almost 40 years, this concept has inspired generations of researchers to identify anti-angiogenic molecules that could be used therapeutically to stop blood vessels formation and starve tumors of nutrients and oxygen. Tumor angiogenesis requires complex cellular and molecular interactions between endothelial and cancer cells. In response to external stimuli such as hypoxia, cancer cells secrete pro-angiogenic factors into the extracellular matrix that activate the surrounding endothelial cells to proliferate, migrate and form new blood vessels. So, vascularization of malignant lesions depends on the expression of specific genes in both endothelial and tumor cells and accumulating evidences shows that several members of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family play key roles in the regulation of these genes. Indeed, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that inhibitors of HDAC modulate angiogenic gene expression in both endothelial and cancer cells and disturb the delicate and complex balance between the collective action of pro-angiogenic factors and angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus, HDAC are currently recognized as promising targets for the development of anti-cancer drugs. This review is an effort to present and discuss the role, functions and mechanisms of action of HDAC during tumor-driven angiogenesis as well as a brief summary of the clinical status of the main HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) currently under development in cancer therapy.", "journal": "Current cancer drug targets", "date": "2010-08-20", "authors": ["DenisMottet", "VincentCastronovo"], "doi": "10.2174/156800910793358014"}
{"title": "Implication of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in tumor angiogenesis: a molecular target for anti-angiogenic therapy?", "abstract": "The inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways has gained great interest for cancer therapy. In this context, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has emerged as a promising molecular target, since it is critically involved in maintaining stability, integrity and functions of key oncogenic proteins. A variety of HSP90 inhibitors have been developed in the past decade and have shown convincing anti-neoplastic activity in pre-clinical tumor models. Importantly, HSP90 inhibitors are predominantly being recognized as \"tumor cell targeting\" agents since cancer cells a) overexpress HSP90 protein, b) highly rely on HSP90 function for maintaining oncogenic signaling, and c) HSP90 inhibitors bind with high affinity to HSP90 in tumor cells. Nevertheless, results from recent studies also suggest that HSP90 inhibitors elicit anti-angiogenic properties by affecting the PI-3K/Akt/eNOS signal transduction pathway in endothelial cells, as well as through down-regulation of VEGFR-2 expression, a crucial component of the angiogenic process. In addition, blocking HSP90 may also diminish the secretion and expression of tumor cell-derived pro-angiogenic growth factors and cytokines, thus leading to \"indirect\" anti-angiogenic effects. This review article focuses on the role of HSP90 in angiogenesis and on delineating the effects of HSP90 inhibitors on angiogenic signaling pathways involved in tumor vascularization.", "journal": "Current cancer drug targets", "date": "2010-08-20", "authors": ["KatharinaStaufer", "OliverStoeltzing"], "doi": "10.2174/156800910793357934"}

The initial aim of this study was to further develop this in vitro model by introducing endothelial cells to mimic the increased vascularization found in psoriasis. Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which did not express CD34 or CD31 in 2D culture, were added to de-epidermised acellular human dermis and cultured for 4 weeks. For induction of a psoriatic phenotype, putrescine was added during this period. We report that after 4 weeks of culture, and particularly when exposed to putrescine, this model showed expression of vertically organised clusters of CD31 positive cells in the dermis in the absence of any exogenous endothelial cells. Further investigation in 2D cell cultures showed an indirect effect of putrescine on normal keratinocytes causing them to produce soluble factors that increased expression of CD133, CD34 and CD31 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts, previously negative for these antigens.

In this study, we addressed the functional and biological role of MTA1 in PCa.\nGene expression profiling was used to determine MTA1 overexpression during PCa cell-bone interaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect MTA1 on tissue microarrays (TMA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31, and Ki67 in xenografts. We used retroviral or lentiviral RNAi transduction of PCa cells to establish MTA1 knockdowns. RT-PCR, Western blot, invasion, and endothelial cell migration assays were used to characterize the cells in vitro. The role of MTA1 in PCa tumorigenesis was evaluated in mouse xenografts.\nWe identified MTA1 as a component of bone metastasis signature in PCa, which suggested a possible role for MTA1 in PCa progression and metastasis. MTA1 was expressed at higher levels in PCa cell lines than in normal prostate epithelial cells. Silencing MTA1 significantly suppressed the invasion and angiogenic activity of the cells in vitro and delayed tumor formation and development in mouse xenografts. Tumors that express MTA1 had higher proliferative indices, secreted higher levels of VEGF and were more vascularized. Analysis of the human TMA showed positive correlation between MTA1 nuclear localization/staining intensity and PCa aggressiveness.\nMTA1 pro-angiogenic and pro-invasive functions create permissive environment for PCa tumor growth and likely support metastasis.

{"title": "Defining conditions for covalent immobilization of angiogenic growth factors onto scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Rapid vascularization of engineered tissues in vitro and in vivo remains one of the key limitations in tissue engineering. We propose that angiogenic growth factors covalently immobilized on scaffolds for tissue engineering can be used to accomplish this goal. The main objectives of this work were: (a) to derive desirable experimental conditions for the covalent immobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) on porous collagen scaffolds; and (b) to determine whether primary endothelial cells respond to these scaffolds with covalently immobilized angiogenic factors. VEGF and Ang1 were covalently immobilized onto porous collagen scaffolds, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) chemistry. To improve covalent immobilization conditions: (a) different reaction buffers [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), distilled water, or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (MES)] were used; and (b) step immobilization was compared to bulk immobilization. In step immobilization, growth factors are applied after EDC activation of the scaffold, while in bulk immobilization, reagents are simultaneously applied to the scaffold. PBS as the reaction buffer resulted in higher amounts of VEGF and Ang1 immobilized (ELISA), higher cell proliferation rates (XTT) and increased lactate metabolism compared to water and MES as the reaction buffers. Step immobilization in PBS buffer was also more effective than bulk immobilization. Immobilized growth factors resulted in higher cell proliferation and lactate metabolism compared to soluble growth factors used at comparable concentrations.

{"title": "[Basic technique for reconstruction after esophagectomy].", "abstract": "The stomach as a conduit after esophagectomy is preferred to the colon because it is much simpler to prepare and involves only 1 anastomosis. The following principles should be followed in preparing the stomach as an esophageal substitute: the complete removal of lymphatics within the left gastric area, and careful preservation of the gastric intramural vascular network. The line of resection, where the vessels of the left gastric area enter the gastric wall, should be cautiously decided. Border between the left and right gastric area of the lesser curvature is identified by the courses of these arteries. The 1st GIA should be inserted slightly toward the caudal side, and the 2nd GIA should be fired along the resection-line. The final GIA should be advanced to the highest point. The space beneath the sternum in the anterior mediastinum is easily created with minimal blood loss. The space is initially created by blunt finger dissection through the abdominal and cervical incisions, and further developed by insertion of a flat malleable intestinal retractor with a hole on 1 side, which is useful for elevating the esophageal substitute without a twist.", "journal": "Kyobu geka.

Consequently, additional antiangiogenic approaches for treatment of breast cancer need to be investigated. Thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis with a greater potency than the related molecule TSP-1. The systemic effects of TSP-2 on tumor metastasis and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-2 have remained poorly understood. We generated a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal region of TSP-2 and the IgG-Fc1 fragment (N-TSP2-Fc) and could demonstrate that the antiangiogenic activity of N-TSP2-Fc is dependent on the CD36 receptor. We found that N-TSP2-Fc inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) on matrigel in vitro and that concurrent incubation of anti-CD36 antibody with N-TSP2-Fc resulted in tube formation that was comparable to untreated control. N-TSP2-Fc potently induced apoptosis of HDMEC in vitro in a CD36-dependent manner. Moreover, we could demonstrate a CD36 receptor-mediated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 in HDMEC in vitro. Daily intraperitoneal injections of N-TSP2-Fc resulted in a significant inhibition of the growth of human MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells grown in the mammary gland of immunodeficient nude mice and in reduced tumor vascularization. Finally, increased serum concentrations of N-TSP2-Fc significantly inhibited regional metastasis to lymph nodes and distant metastasis to lung as shown by quantitative real-time alu PCR. These results identify N-TSP2-Fc as a potent systemic inhibitor of tumor metastasis and provide strong evidence for an important role of the CD36 receptor in mediating the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-2.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2010-08-18", "authors": ["ManuelKoch", "FadiHussein", "AndreasWoeste", "CarstenGr\u00fcndker", "KarlFrontzek", "G\u00fcnterEmons", "ThomasHawighorst"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-010-1085-7\n10.1016/j.biocel.2004.01.004\n10.1016/S0039-6060(97)90043-X\n10.1054/bjoc.2000.1268\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f0ad79\n10.1002/1097-0142(19950915)76:6<998::AID-CNCR2820760613>3.0.CO;2-0\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1528\n10.1083/jcb.138.3.707\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.021\n10.1038/nature04483\n10.1056/NEJM197108122850711\n10.1093/emboj/20.11.2631\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2396\n10.1007/s10549-009-0460-8\n10.1038/71517\n10.1007/s00018-007-7486-z\n10.1056/NEJMra0706596\n10.1083/jcb.151.2.221\n10.1083/jcb.140.2.419\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62512-6\n10.1016/S0955-0674(00)00143-5\n10.1172/JCI1684\n10.1056/NEJMoa072113\n10.1016/S1471-4914(03)00047-9\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0419\n10.1016/0022-1759(91)90198-O\n10.1097/00000478-199910000-00015\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12643.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961215)78:12<2515::AID-CNCR11>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.027\n10.1007/s10549-006-9392-8\n10.1038/73432\n10.1023/A:1020992411420\n10.1074/jbc.270.13.7304\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-3299-2\n10.1038/84643\n10.1073/pnas.96.26.14888\n10.1083/jcb.122.2.497\n10.1002/jcb.240530109\n10.1006/bbrc.1995.2780\n10.1023/A:1018477516367\n10.1007/s10549-008-9992-6"}

HSPGs bind to numerous growth factor ligands including fibroblast growth factors (FGF), epidermal growth factors (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and are critically important in the context of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. We hypothesized that sulfatase activity in the tumor microenvironment would regulate tumor growth in vivo.\nWe established a model of stable expression of sulfatases in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and purified recombinant human Sulfatase 2 (rhSulf2) for exogenous administration. In vitro studies were performed to measure effects on breast cancer cell invasion and proliferation, and groups were statistically compared using Student's t-test. The effects of hSulf2 on tumor progression were tested using in vivo xenografts with two methods. First, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing hSulf1, hSulf2, or both hSulf1/hSulf2 were grown as xenografts and the resulting tumor growth and vascularization was compared to controls. Secondly, wild type MDA-MB-231 xenografts were treated by short-term intratumoral injection with rhSulf2 or vehicle during tumor growth. Ultrasound analysis was also used to complement caliper measurement to monitor tumor growth. In vivo studies were statistically analyzed using Student's t test.\nIn vitro, stable expression of hSulf2 or administration of rhSulf2 in breast cancer cells decreased cell proliferation and invasion, corresponding to an inhibition of ERK activation. Stable expression of the sulfatases in xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth, with complete regression of tumors expressing both hSulf1 and hSulf2 and significantly smaller tumor volumes in groups expressing hSulf1 or hSulf2 compared to control xenografts. Despite significant suppression of tumor volume, sulfatases did not affect vascular density within the tumors. By contrast, transient exogenous treatment of MDA-MB-231 xenografts with rhSulf2 was not sufficient to inhibit or reverse tumor growth.\nThese data indicate that in vivo progression of human breast cancer xenografts can be inhibited with sulfatase expression, and therapeutic effect requires constant delivery at the tumor site.

Although antiangiogenic therapies using anti-VEGF drugs are effective in treating retinal neovascularization, they show a transient efficacy and cause general adverse effects. New therapeutic target molecules are needed to resolve these issues. It was recently demonstrated that the apelin/APJ system, a newly deorphanized G protein-coupled receptor system, is involved in physiological retinal vascularization. Retinal angiography and mRNA expression were examined during hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Compared with age-matched control mice, retinal apelin expression was dramatically increased during the hypoxic phase in oxygen-induced retinopathy model mice. APJ was colocalized in proliferative cells, which were probably endothelial cells of the ectopic vessels in the vitreous body. Apelin deficiency hardly induced hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis despite the upregulation of VEGF and erythropoietin mRNA in oxygen-induced retinopathy model mice. Apelin small and interfering RNA suppressed the proliferation of endothelial cells independent of the VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 signaling pathway.\nThese results suggest that apelin is a prerequisite factor for hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2010-08-14", "authors": ["AtsushiKasai", "YukiIshimaru", "ToshihikoKinjo", "TatsuyaSatooka", "NaoMatsumoto", "YasuhiroYoshioka", "AkikoYamamuro", "FumiGomi", "NorihitoShintani", "AkemichiBaba", "SadaakiMaeda"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209775"}

We have uncovered a previously unrecognized role for PTEN in regulating Ca(2+) entry through transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6) that does not require PTEN phosphatase activity. We show that PTEN tail-domain residues 394-403 permit PTEN to associate with TRPC6. The inflammatory mediator thrombin promotes this association. Deletion of PTEN residues 394-403 prevents TRPC6 cell surface expression and Ca(2+) entry. However, PTEN mutant, C124S, which lacks phosphatase activity, did not alter TRPC6 activity. Thrombin failed to increase endothelial monolayer permeability in the endothelial cells, transducing the \u0394394-403 PTEN mutant. Paradoxically, we also show that thrombin failed to induce endothelial cell migration and tube formation in cells transducing the \u0394394-403 PTEN mutant. Our results demonstrate that PTEN, through residues 394-403, serves as a scaffold for TRPC6, enabling cell surface expression of the channel. Ca(2+) entry through TRPC6 induces an increase in endothelial permeability and directly promotes angiogenesis.

We observed that resveratrol was able to modulate the expression of VEGF and the formation of vascular network in a biphasic pattern.

The biphasic effect of resveratrol on angiogenesis was confirmed by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Up-regulation of VEGF expression depended on the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of \u03b2-catenin. Correspondingly, GSK3\u03b2, a negative regulator of \u03b2-catenin, turned into a less active state (phosphorylated at Ser9) in cells exposed to 5\u03bcM of resveratrol, but became more active at 20\u03bcM.

{"title": "Cryogenic prototyping of chitosan scaffolds with controlled micro and macro architecture and their effect on in vivo neo-vascularization and cellular infiltration.", "abstract": "A major challenge in tissue engineering has been to develop scaffolds with controlled complex geometries, on both the macro- and micro-scale. One group of techniques, using rapid prototyping (RP) processes, has the capability to produce complex three-dimensional structures with good control over the size, geometry, and connectivity of the pores. In this article, a novel technique based on RP technology, that is, cryogenic prototyping (CP), that has the capability to fabricate scaffolds with controlled macro- and micro-structures, is presented. Our in vivo studies showed that the micro architecture (i.e., both pore size and pore orientation) and macro structures of the CP scaffolds affect both cellular infiltration and neo-vascularization. Full cellular infiltration and neo-vascularization were observed after 28 days in scaffolds with micropore sizes of 90 microm. In addition, it was observed that channels (300 microm) created in scaffolds were effective at enhancing cellular infiltration and vascularization. Our results have demonstrated that CP is a viable method for fabricating scaffolds for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Prepared HA-ACMs were rehydrated in different concentrations of VEGF (1, 2, 3, 10, and 50 ng/g ACM). Grafts were implanted in mice peritoneum in situ for 1 week. Angiogenesis was quantified with CD31 and Factor VIII immunostaining using Simple PCI. Selected optimal VEGF concentration that induced maximum vascularization was then used in porcine bladder augmentation model. Implants were left in for 4 and 10 weeks. Three groups of six pigs each were implanted with ACM alone, HA-ACM, and HA-VEGF-ACM. Histological, immunohistochemical (Uroplakin III, alpha-SMA, Factor VIII), and immunofluorescence (CD31) analysis were performed to assess graft regenerative capacity and angiogenesis. In mouse model, statistically significant increase in microvascular density was demonstrated in the 2 ng/g ACM group. When this concentration was used in porcine model, recellularization increased significantly from weeks 4 to 10 in HA-VEGF-ACM, with progressive decrease in fibrosis. Significantly increased vascularization, coupled with increased urothelium and smooth muscle cell (SMC) regeneration, was observed in HA-VEGF grafts at week 10 in the center and periphery, compared with week 4. HA-VEGF grafts displayed highest in vivo epithelialization, neovascularization, and SMCs regeneration.

We have also shown that aged, involuted thymi can be rejuvenated when transplanted as vascularized thymic lobes into juvenile swine recipients. The present studies were aimed at elucidating the extrinsic factors facilitating this restoration of function in the aged thymus. In particular, we tested the impact of sex steroid blockade by Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH).\n30 naive animals (25 males and 5 females) were used for measurement of serum testosterone levels. 3 mature male pigs (aged at 22, 22 and 29 months old) were used to test the effects of Lupron (LHRH analog) injection at 45 mg (per 70-80 kg body weight) as a 3-month depot on testosterone levels and thymic rejuvenation. Thymic rejuvenation was assessed by histology, flow cytometric analysis, morphometric analysis and TREC assays.\nHormonal alterations were induced by Lupron and resulted in macroscopic and histologic regeneration of the thymus of aged animals within 2 months, as evidenced by restoration of juvenile thymus architecture and increased cellularity. Two animals that were evaluated for TREC both showed increased levels in the periphery following Lupron treatment.\nTreatment of aged animals with Lupron leads to thymic rejuventaion in adult miniature swine.

The experiments in this study were aimed at elucidating that suture-based permanent mesh fixation can be replaced by fixation with N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue (Glubran2) for surgical repair of abdominal wall hernias.\nIn 25 Wistar rats, two hernia defects (1.5 cm in diameter) per animal were created bilaterally in the midline of the abdominal wall. The peritoneum was spared. The lesions were left untreated for 10 d to achieve a chronic condition. Then the defects were covered with TiMESH extralight (2 \u00d7 2 cm) and fixed by 30 \u03bcL of Glubran2 or traditional suture. The time points of sacrifice were 17 and 28 d, 3, 4, and 5\u00a0mo. At autopsy, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response and the presence of apoptotic cells respectively.\nMesh fixation was excellent in all samples at each time point. At application sites, the inflammatory reaction was mild with a small number of macrophages and vascularized connective tissue presence around glue and mesh threads. Glue residues were observed in histologic sections at each time point.

We report a retrospective study comparing the results of application of three sessions of shockwaves therapy (SW) with energy flux density (EFD) impulses of 0.09 (SD = 0.02) mJ/mm(2) ESWT emitted by an electromagnetic generator in 58 patients (group I) affected by pseudoarthrosis of the carpal scaphoid, with the results of surgical treatment consisting of stabilization and bone graft according to the Matti-Russe technique, performed in 60 subjects (controls, group II).

Everolimus strongly inhibited growth of the sensitive models in vivo but also significantly inhibited growth of the insensitive models, an effect attributable to its known anti-angiogenic/vascular properties. However, although tumor FDG and FLT uptake was significantly reduced in the sensitive models, it was not affected in the insensitive models, suggesting that endothelial-directed effects could not be detected by these PET tracers. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a well-vascularized orthotopic rat mammary tumor model, other antiangiogenic agents also failed to affect FDG uptake, despite inhibiting tumor growth. In contrast, the cytotoxic patupilone, a microtubule stabilizer, blocked tumor growth, and markedly reduced FDG uptake.

{"title": "Airway complications after lung transplantation can be avoided without bronchial artery revascularization.", "abstract": "The major cause of death following lung transplantation in the beginning after the first human lung transplantation in 1963 was airway dehiscence, representing a major obstacle to widespread use of this treatment option. Lung transplantation is unique among all solid organ transplantations, since systemic arterial blood supply is not restored during engraftment. In the eighties and thereafter the problem of airway healing after lung transplantation was the main focus of research. This review focuses on the incidence of airway anastomotic complications after lung transplantation and delineates potential risk factors.\nRefinements in lung preservation and surgical technique have reduced the incidence of airway complications. Reflecting these changes, the contemporary rate of anastomotic lesions following lung transplantation has dropped from 80% before 1983 to less than 3% with a range of 2.6-23.8%. Small clinical series of lung transplantation with direct bronchial artery revascularization have reported promising early results. However, direct bronchial artery revascularization has been considered a difficult and unreliable method to be used clinically, as it prolongs the operation and ischemic time, increases risk of bleeding, and because of the good results reported from transplants without bronchial artery revascularization. At the present time (nearly) all transplant centers perform the airway anastomosis without bronchial artery revascularization.\nBronchial anastomotic complications can be avoided by use of a standardized surgical technique which respects the fact that the donor bronchus is poorly vascularized.

To assess the significance of Notch3 on blood vessel formation in vivo, we investigated its role in retinal angiogenesis.\nWe show that Notch3-deficient mice exhibit reduced retinal vascularization, with diminished sprouting and vascular branching. Moreover, Notch3 deletion impairs mural cell investment, resulting in progressive loss of vessel coverage. In an oxygen-induced retinopathy model, we demonstrate that Notch3 is induced in hypoxia and interestingly, pathological neovascularization is decreased in retinas of Notch3-null mice. Analysis of oxygen-induced retinopathy mediators revealed that angiopoietin-2 expression is significantly reduced in the absence of Notch3. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that Notch3 is sufficient for angiopoietin-2 induction, and this expression is additionally enhanced in the presence of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1.\nThese results provide compelling evidence that Notch3 is important for the investment of mural cells and is a critical regulator of developmental and pathological blood vessel formation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-08-07", "authors": ["HuaLiu", "WenboZhang", "SimoneKennard", "Ruth BCaldwell", "BrendaLilly"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.218271"}

To test the role of astrocyte-derived VEGF, we used Cre-lox technology in mice to delete VEGF in retinal astrocytes during development. Surprisingly, this only had a minor impact on retinal vasculature development, with only small decreases in plexus spreading, endothelial cell proliferation and survival observed. In contrast, astrocyte VEGF deletion had more pronounced effects on hyperoxia-induced vaso-obliteration and led to the regression of smooth muscle cell-coated radial arteries and veins, which are usually resistant to the vessel-collapsing effects of hyperoxia.

{"title": "Strategies for vascularization of polymer scaffolds.", "abstract": "Biocompatible, degradable polymer scaffolds combined with cells or biological signals are being investigated as alternatives to traditional options for tissue reconstruction and transplantation. These approaches are already in clinical use as engineered tissues that enhance wound healing and skin regeneration. The continued enhancement of these material strategies is highly dependent on the ability to promote rapid and stable neovascularization (new blood vessel formation) within the scaffold. Whereas neovascularization therapies have shown some promise for the treatment of ischemic tissues, vascularization of polymer scaffolds in tissue engineering strategies provides a unique challenge owing to the volume and the complexity of the tissues targeted. In this article, we examine recent advances in research focused on promoting neovascularization in polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. These approaches include the use of growth factors, cells, and novel surgical approaches to both enhance and control the nature of the vascular networks formed. The continued development of these approaches may lead to new tissue engineering strategies for the generation of skin and other tissues or organs.", "journal": "Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research", "date": "2010-08-05", "authors": ["GeorgiaPapavasiliou", "Ming-HueiCheng", "Eric MBrey"], "doi": "10.231/JIM.0b013e3181f18e38"}

Epirubicin alone failed to induce changes in VEGF expression (P = 0.54), while the addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin resulted in a significant reduction in VEGF expression (P < 0.001). As a consequence, baseline VEGF had a negative prognostic role in patients who received epirubicin alone but not in patients receiving epirubicin plus tamoxifen (interaction test P < 0.05). VEGFR2 expression increased at residual tumor histology in both treatment arms, with a lesser extent in patients receiving tamoxifen plus epirubicin.

We have characterized the anatomical and biochemical properties of the Semitendinosus muscle of clones versus controls at day 60 and day 260. We have analyzed the contractile and metabolic properties of muscle fibers by measuring the abundance of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms and activities of metabolic enzymes (LDH, PFK, COX, CS, ICDH), respectively. The spatial repartition of some components of the extracellular matrix (collagen types I, IV, VI, chondroitin-6-sulfate, decorin, and tenascin-X) was also studied. At day 60 we found lower numbers and structural organization of fibers, and a delay in the setup of the extracellular matrix. IGF-2 transcript abundance was lower in clones than in their controls. There was no difference in the expression of VEGF (a growth factor regulating vascularization and myogenesis) and its receptor. At day 260 the muscles of fetal clones have not reached the same degree of differentiation than controls as shown by their lower energy metabolisms and their MyHC pattern.

Four weeks after transplantation, only the L6-Bcl2 rats showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction. Their vascular density in the damaged myocardium was greater, and they had more proliferating cells. The L6-Bcl2 group had an increased amount of myocytes in the infarct area. Soluble factors from L6-Bcl2 sheets induced a 2.9-fold increase in endothelial cell proliferation, and enhanced endothelial wound healing as compared to the L6-WT sheets.

{"title": "Neuropeptide Y and its Y2 receptor: potential targets in neuroblastoma therapy.", "abstract": "Neuroblastomas are pediatric tumors that develop from sympathetic precursors and express neuronal proteins, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY is a sympathetic neurotransmitter acting via multiple receptors (Y1-Y5R). Both NPY and Y2Rs are commonly expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and tissues. The peptide secreted from neuroblastomas stimulates tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. As both processes are Y2R-mediated, the aim of this study was to assess Y2R as a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma. In vitro, Y2R antagonist (BIIE0246) prevented activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by endogenous NPY, which resulted in decreased proliferation and induction of Bim-mediated apoptosis. Similar growth-inhibitory effects were achieved with NPY small interfering RNA (siRNA) and Y2R siRNA. In vivo, Y2R antagonist significantly inhibited growth of SK-N-BE(2) and SK-N-AS xenografts, which was associated with decreased activation of p44/42 MAPK, as well as reduced proliferation (Ki67) and increased apoptosis (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; TUNEL). The Y2R antagonist also exerted an antiangiogenic effect. In vitro, it reduced the proliferation of endothelial cells induced by neuroblastoma-conditioned media. Consequently, the Y2R antagonist-treated xenografts had decreased vascularization and a high degree of focal fibrosis. In human neuroblastoma tissues, the expression of Y2R was observed in both tumor and endothelial cells, while NPY was predominantly expressed in neuroblastoma cells.

According to the Neer classification, 12 patients (mean age 56 years) had three-part fractures, 19 patients (mean age 67 years) had four-part fractures, and one patient had a four-part fracture dislocation. Ten patients were in the age group of <60 years, 22 patients were in the age group of 60=or>years. All the patients were evaluated with plain radiographs preoperatively; in addition, computed tomography was used in 14 patients in whom articular surface and tuberculum displacement could not be assessed adequately. The operation was performed through a standard deltopectoral approach, and minimal soft tissue dissection was used aiming not to impair vascularization of the fracture fragments. A cerclage wire was used to help reduction in 12 patients. An oblique screw was inserted to stabilize the medial colon in cases in which medial cortical contact was insufficient. Bone grafting was not used in any of the patients. Active-assisted and passive exercises of the shoulder were initiated on the second postoperative day. Active abduction to 90 degrees was allowed two weeks after surgery. During follow-up, implant failure, loss of reduction, malunion, and bone healing were assessed on plain radiographs.

Typical radiological features include shortening of the tubular bones and macrocephaly, due to disruption of endochondral ossification. Consequently, FGFR3 has been described as a negative regulator of bone growth. Studying a large cohort of ACH patients, a delay in bone age was observed shortly after birth (for boys p=2.6\u00d710(-9) and for girls p=1.2\u00d710(-8)). This delay was no longer apparent during adolescence. In order to gain further insight into bone formation, bone development was studied in a murine model of chondrodysplasia (Fgfr3(Y367C/+)) from birth to 6weeks of age. Delayed bone age was also observed in Fgfr3(Y367C/+) mice at 1week of age followed by an accelerated secondary ossification center formation. A low level of chondrocyte proliferation was observed in the normal growth plate at birth, which increased with bone growth. In the pathological condition, a significantly high level of proliferative cells was present at birth, but exhibited a transient decrease only to rise again subsequently. Histological and in situ analyses suggested the altered endochondral ossification process may result from delayed chondrocyte differentiation, disruption of vascularization and osteoblast invasion of the femur. All these data provide evidence that FGFR3 regulates normal chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during bone growth and suggest that constitutive activation of the receptor disrupts both processes. Therefore, the consequences of FGFR3 activation on the physiological process of bone development appear to be dependent on spatial and temporal occurrence. In conclusion, these observations support the notion that FGFR3 has a dual effect, as both a negative and a positive regulator of the endochondral ossification process during post-natal bone development.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2010-08-03", "authors": ["St\u00e9phaniePannier", "EmilieMugniery", "Aur\u00e9lieJonquoy", "CatherineBenoist-Lasselin", "ThierryOdent", "Jean-PhilippeJais", "ArnoldMunnich", "LaurenceLegeai-Mallet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2010.07.020"}
{"title": "The correlation between the internal structure and vascularization of controllable porous bioceramic materials in vivo: a quantitative study.", "abstract": "It is noticeable that porous architectural characteristics of the biomaterials play an important role in revascularization of the scaffold. However, there has been no consensus regarding the optimal conditions for vascularization, including macropore size, shape, interconnection, and the arrangement of macropores, due to the failure to accurately control porous structure of biomaterials. To investigate the effect of the porous structure parameters on vascularization of the biomaterials, an accurate control of these parameters is required. In this study, porous \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) with accurately controlled pore parameters is fabricated by using assembled organic microspheres as templates combined with casting technique. Using this technique, we produced a series of disk-type \u03b2-TCP with variable pore sizes and variable interconnections to evaluate the influence of macropore size and interconnection on the vascularization of bioceramic material in vivo. The vascularization of \u03b2-TCP implanted in the rabbit model is evaluated by histomorphology and single photon emission computed tomography. The results showed that the pore parameters affect not only the size of the blood vessels growing into the porous structure but also the number of blood vessels formed in the pores of the bioceramic. The increase in pore size only resulted in an increase in size of the blood vessels growing into the macroporous of the bioceramic scaffolds. However, with the increase in size of interconnection, both the size and number of the blood vessels formed in the macroporous increased. Therefore, we conclude that the size of the interconnections is more important for vascularization in the scaffold compared with the pore size. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in vascularization in the scaffolds with pores size above 400\u2009\u03bcm, and there was no marked increase in extent of vascularization with further increase in pore size above 400\u2009\u03bcm, indicating that the upper limit of pore size for vascularization is 400\u2009\u03bcm.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) are released at traumatic or surgical wound sites and play major roles in vascularization and wound healing, we measured the concentrations of VEGF165 and FGF-2 in the exudate and fibrinous sloughs of PUs after PVFD. We collected 10 exudate samples and 3 samples of fibrinous sloughs from 10 PUs of 9 patients immediately after PVFD for 8 h and measured VEGF165 and FGF-2 by ELISA. All 10 exudate samples contained substantial amounts of VEGF165, from 2.79 to 13.27 microg g(-1), irrespective of the severity of the PUs.

Archival paraffin-embedded tissues from 4 fetal femora and 10 cases of chondromyxoid fibroma were analyzed simultaneously using histochemistry (safranin O) and established immunohistochemical antibodies (CD34, CD163, and smooth muscle actin). Vascularized cartilage canals growing into the fetal cartilage from the perichondrium displayed characteristic glomeruloid structures with central arterioles within the immature mesenchymal stroma and numerous superficial sinusoidal blood vessels accompanied by macrophage infiltration. Similarly, each case of chondromyxoid fibroma demonstrated admixture of two characteristic components: immature fibrous tissue of vascularized stroma with accumulation of macrophages in areas of superficial sinusoidal proliferation, and variable amounts of lobulated chondroid tissue. Based on the observed substantial morphological similarity between the cartilage canals and chondromyxoid fibroma, we suggest that the chondromyxoid fibroma represents a neoplasm originating from or mimicking the fetal cartilage canals within the immature cartilage.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2010-07-31", "authors": ["JozefZustin", "HanaAkpalo", "MarcoGambarotti", "MatthiasPriemel", "Johannes MRueger", "Andreas MLuebke", "DennisReske", "ClaudiaLange", "KlausPueschel", "ChristophLohmann", "WolfgangR\u00fcther", "MichaelAmling", "MarcoAlberghini"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2010.100171"}

The second proximal segment differs from the first segment in having taller columnar epithelium and a relatively narrow lumen. The intermediate segment is lined by non-ciliated columnar epithelium and its lumen appears empty. The distal tubule is narrow in diameter and its cuboidal epithelium is devoid of intercalated cells. A unique feature of L. chalumnae is having binucleate cells in the tubule and collecting duct epithelium.

In this study, we provide structural evidence for a second function of the oropharynx in the North American common musk turtle, Sternotherus odoratus, Kinosternidae: aquatic gas exchange. Using high-speed video, we demonstrate that S. odoratus can grasp food on land by its jaws, but is afterward incapable of lingual based intraoral transport; food is always lost during such an attempt. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy reveal that the reason for this is a poorly developed tongue. Although small, the tongue bears a variety of lobe-like papillae, which might be misinterpreted as an adaptation for terrestrial food uptake. Similar papillae also cover most of the oropharynx. They are highly vascularized as shown by light microscopy and may play an important role in aquatic gas exchange. The vascularization of the oropharyngeal papillae in S. odoratus is then compared with that in Emys orbicularis, an aquatic emydid with similar ecology but lacking the ability of underwater respiration. Oropharyngeal papillae responsible for aquatic respiration are also found in soft-shelled turtles (Trionychidae), the putative sister group of the kinosternids.

Tumour cells are prone to die by necrosis when they are metabolically stressed by hypoxic and glucose depletion (OGD) due to insufficient vascularization, a common feature of solid tumours. Tumour necrosis indicates poor prognosis and emergence of drug resistance in cancer patients; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) as an in vitro tumour model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying necrosis-linked drug resistance. MCF-7 cells formed tight and spherical shape of spheroids and started to form the necrotic core at 8 days of culture. We found that docetaxel (DOC)-induced apoptosis was gradually reduced during MCF-7 spheroid culture compared to that in monolayers and that more prominent resistance to DOC was observed when spheroids containing the necrotic core were treated. ERK1/2 and Akt appeared to be activated in MCF-7 spheroids with necrotic core, but not in 2D culture cells and in spheroids without necrotic core. DOC resistance in spheroids was reversed by inhibition of ERK1/2, but not of Akt, suggesting an important role for ERK1/2 in the DOC resistance in MCF-7 spheroids.

{"title": "Regulatory mechanisms in vascular calcification.", "abstract": "In the past decade, the prevalence, significance, and regulatory mechanisms of vascular calcification have gained increasing recognition. Over a century ago, pathologists recognized atherosclerotic calcification as a form of extraskeletal ossification. Studies are now identifying the mechanism of this remarkable process as a recapitulation of embryonic endochondral and membranous ossification through phenotypic plasticity of vascular cells that function as adult mesenchymal stem cells. These embryonic developmental programs, involving bone morphogenetic proteins and potent osteochondrogenic transcription factors, are triggered and modulated by a variety of inflammatory, metabolic, and genetic disorders, particularly hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis. They are also triggered by loss of powerful inhibitors, such as fetuin A, matrix Gla protein, and pyrophosphate, which ordinarily restrict biomineralization to skeletal bone. Teleologically, soft-tissue calcification might serve to create a wall of bone to sequester noxious foci such as chronic infections, parasites, and foreign bodies. This Review focuses on atherosclerotic and medial calcification. The capacity of the vasculature to produce mineral in culture and to produce de novo, vascularized, trabecular bone and cartilage tissue, even in patients with osteoporosis, should intrigue investigators in tissue engineering and regenerative biology.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

Porous tubular biomatrices with an inner diameter of 3\u2009 mm were prepared using highly purified collagen fibrils and were crosslinked with or without heparin. Heparinized biomatrices were supplemented with the heparin-binding GFs vascular endothelial GF, fibroblast GF-2, and heparin-binding epidermal GF. Biomatrices with and without GFs were used to replace a critical 1\u2009cm urethral segment in rabbits (n\u2009=\u200932). All animals showed normal urination without urinary retention. General histology and immunohistology of graft areas (2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after implantation) indicated that all biomatrices were replaced by urethra-like structures with normal appearing cytokeratin-positive urothelium surrounded by vascularized tissue. The GF-containing biomatrices showed an increase in extracellular matrix deposition, neovascularization, urothelium, glands, granulocytes, and fibroblasts, compared with biomatrices without GF. GFs substantially improved molecular features of healing but failed to be superior in functional outcome. Retrograde urethrography indicated a normal urethral caliber in case of biomatrices without GF, but a relative narrowing of the urethra at 2 weeks postsurgery and diverticula after 4 weeks in case of biomatrices with GF.

{"title": "Quiescence and activation of stem and precursor cell populations in the subependymal zone of the mammalian brain are associated with distinct cellular and extracellular matrix signals.", "abstract": "The subependymal zone (SEZ) of the lateral ventricles is one of the areas of the adult brain where new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem cells (NSCs), via rapidly dividing precursors. This neurogenic niche is a complex cellular and extracellular microenvironment, highly vascularized compared to non-neurogenic periventricular areas, within which NSCs and precursors exhibit distinct behavior. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms by which extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors might regulate this differential behavior. We show that NSCs and precursors proceed through mitosis in the same domains within the SEZ of adult male mice--albeit with NSCs nearer ependymal cells--and that distance from the ventricle is a stronger limiting factor for neurogenic activity than distance from blood vessels. Furthermore, we show that NSCs and precursors are embedded in a laminin-rich extracellular matrix, to which they can both contribute. Importantly, they express differential levels of extracellular matrix receptors, with NSCs expressing low levels of alpha6beta1 integrin, syndecan-1, and lutheran, and in vivo blocking of beta1 integrin selectively induced the proliferation and ectopic migration of precursors. Finally, when NSCs are activated to reconstitute the niche after depletion of precursors, expression of laminin receptors is upregulated. These results indicate that the distinct behavior of adult NSCs and precursors is not necessarily regulated via exposure to differential extracellular signals, but rather via intrinsic regulation of their interaction with their microenvironment.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2010-07-28", "authors": ["IliasKazanis", "Justin DLathia", "Tegy JVadakkan", "EricRaborn", "RuiqianWan", "Mohamed RMughal", "D MarkEckley", "TakakoSasaki", "BrucePatton", "Mark PMattson", "Karen KHirschi", "Mary EDickinson", "Charlesffrench-Constant"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0700-10.2010"}

PE-induced endothelium injury plays a critical role in the pathophysiological consequences of PE. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be mobilized from the bone marrow to enter circulation and play important roles in repair of damaged endothelium. However, it is not yet known if EPC mobilization results from PE. The alterations of the quantity and function of bone marrow-derived EPCs were detected in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) events in mice, and the possible role of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway in those alterations was explored. APE models were established by injection of autologous thrombi into the right jugular vein of C57BL/6 mice. Mice were divided into sham and experimental groups including one hour (1H), one day (1D) and two day (2D) groups after injection. The results showed that in the APE 1D group, the thrombi were easily found in the large or medium pulmonary vessel. And CD133(+) or CD34(+) cells in bone marrow increased significantly, while CD133(+)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(+) EPCs decreased. After seven days in culture, the abilities of incorporation into a vascular network, adhesion to fibronectin, migration and proliferation of bone marrow-derived EPCs in the APE 1D group increased significantly. The mRNA and protein expression levels of eNOS in EPCs increased in the APE 1D group. Treatment of EPCs with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester inhibited functional alterations induced by APE. The results suggested that APE events stimulate the mobilization of EPCs from bone marrow, and enhance their functions.

VEGF-A is essential for glomerular development and function but its role in other aspects of renal function is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the role of VEGF-A, derived specifically from haematopoietic and endothelial lineages in the kidney. We crossed VavCre and floxed Vegf-a mice allowing specific ablation of a single Vegf-a allele in the haematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Mutants were viable and fertile and had normal haematological composition, indicating that 50% gene dosage of Vegf-a in the Vav-expressing lineage is sufficient for establishing a functional haematopoietic system and mature vascular network. However, several abnormalities were observed in the kidney of the adult mutants. These included the formation of inclusion bodies in the proximal tubular cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. These features were observed in 9-11 month-old mutant animals. Most of these abnormalities have been described in aging kidneys in man, and were also observed in the older control mice (24 months). The pathological features appeared in mutant male animals at a younger age than in female mutants.

Our results showed that VASH-1 protein expression was muscle-type specific, with higher levels detected in less vascularized muscles. In rat plantaris and heart muscles, the expression of VASH-1 protein was decreased in response to exercise training, a physiological pro-angiogenic stimulus leading to muscle capillary growth. Interestingly, expression patterns for p36 and p42 were different between plantaris and heart muscles. Next, we analyzed the time-course expression of VASH-1 isoforms in rat soleus muscles subjected to hindlimb unloading, a model that induces muscle capillary regression. Both p36 and p42 isoforms were increased, a signal in favor of some vessel destabilization and regression. Finally, we investigated VASH-1 expression in plantaris muscles from Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF) that develop obesity and type-2 diabetes associated with a loss of capillaries in skeletal muscle. VASH-1 expression was higher in sedentary ZDF rats when compared to lean animals, suggesting its potential role during capillary regression.

We have recently proposed a new model of the neonatal islet formation in mice by a process of fission following contiguous endocrine cell proliferation in the form of branched cord-like structures in embryos and newborns. There exist large stretches of interconnected islet structures along large blood vessels in the neonatal pancreas, which, upon further development, segregate into smaller fragments (i.e., islets) that eventually become more spherical by internal proliferation as seen in the adult pancreas. \u03b1-cells span these elongated islet-like structures in the developing pancreas, which we hypothesize represent sites of fission and facilitate the eventual formation of discrete islets. The \u03b1-cells express both prohormone convertase 2 and 1/3 (PC 2 and PC 1/3, respectively), which resulted in the processing of the proglucagon precursor into glucagon-like peptide 1, thereby leading to local production of this important \u00df-cell growth factor. Furthermore, while \u03b1-cells in the adult basically only express PC 2, significant activation of PC 1/3 is also observed in mouse models of insulin resistance such as pregnant, ob/ ob, db/db and prediabetic NOD mice, which may be a common mechanism in proliferating \u00df-cells.

This review summarizes the studies directed on the teratogenicity of homocysteine carried out in animal studies, and elaborates on the underlying mechanisms.\nLiterature was searched in Pubmed (NCBI) through January 2010 and selected manually. Keywords comprised homocysteine, congenital abnormalities and animals.\nIncreased frequencies of a wide range of congenital malformations are reported especially in the chicken embryo after exposure to homocysteine (Hcy) in various dosages and forms. Reduced embryonic growth and abnormalities of the vascularization of the yolk sac are described in mouse studies. A study in rats revealed a reduced development of blastocysts. The congenital malformations observed in the chicken embryo model share the mutual involvement of Hcy sensitive neural crest cells. Derangements in the behavior of these cells by interactions between Hcy and pathways involved in vascularization, growth, metabolism, signaling, and DNA synthesis and methylation may explain the wide range of effects on embryonic organs, the yolk sac and placental tissues.\nThe associations between human hyperhomocysteinemia and congenital malformations are substantiated by chicken and rodent studies. Moreover, derangements of several pathways induced by Hcy are demonstrated with adverse effects on both reproduction and long term health. Because of the high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in both the reproductive and general population, research on underlying epigenetic mechanisms is warranted.", "journal": "Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)", "date": "2010-07-27", "authors": ["Nina Hvan Mil", "Annelien MOosterbaan", "R\u00e9gine P MSteegers-Theunissen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reprotox.2010.07.002"}

Myopericytoma is largely considered a neoplasm of skin and soft tissues, with examples of this lesion involving visceral sites being extremely limited. We present the clinical and pathologic details of an unusual case of myopericytoma occurring in the kidney. Histologically, the tumor was richly vascularized and composed of a perivascular proliferation of oval to spindle-shaped cells with bland cytologic features. The neoplastic cells were arranged in a concentric fashion around vascular lumina and also surrounded dilated, branching vessels, with a glomangiopericytomatous appearance. Mitotic figures were inconspicuous, and necrosis was absent. Perivascular myoid differentiation was supported by positive immunoreactivity for muscle-specific and smooth muscle actins, and absence of reactivity for desmin. The present case serves to expand the anatomical distribution of myopericytoma and also broadens the spectrum of primary mesenchymal neoplasms that may be encountered in the kidney.", "journal": "Human pathology", "date": "2010-07-27", "authors": ["Sean KLau", "RomanKlein", "ZhongJiang", "Lawrence MWeiss", "Peiguo GChu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.humpath.2010.02.014"}

LRP5 loss-of-function mutations cause incomplete development of retinal vessel network in humans as well as in mice. To understand the underlying mechanism for how LRP5 mutations lead to retinal vascular abnormalities, we have determined the retinal cell types that express LRP5 and investigated specific molecular and cellular functions that may be regulated by LRP5 signaling in the retina.\nWe characterized the development of retinal vasculature in LRP5 mutant mice using specific retinal cell makers and a GFP transgene expressed in retinal endothelial cells. Our data revealed that retinal vascular endothelial cells predominantly formed cell clusters in the inner-plexiform layer of LRP5 mutant retina rather than sprouting out or migrating into deeper layers to form normal vascular network in the retina. The IRES-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) report gene under the control of the endogenous LRP5 promoter was highly expressed in M\u00fcller cells and was also weakly detected in endothelial cells of the retinal surface vasculature. Moreover, the LRP5 mutant mice had a reduction of a M\u00fcller cell-specific glutamine transporter, Slc38a5, and showed a decrease in b-wave amplitude of electroretinogram.\nLRP5 is not only essential for vascular endothelial cells to sprout, migrate and/or anastomose in the deeper plexus during retinal vasculature development but is also important for the functions of M\u00fcller cells and retinal interneurons.

We investigated potential mechanisms by which darbepoetin exerts cardioprotection following myocardial infarction in mice and the significance of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)-common beta-chain (c-beta-chain) heteroreceptor.\nMice underwent 60 min coronary occlusion followed by treatment with vehicle or a single dose of darbepoetin. Effects on gene expression, apoptosis and neutrophil accumulation in infarcted left ventricle were assessed 24 h later. Cardiac function, effects on vascularization and fibrosis were assessed 28 days later. The significance of EPOR-c-beta-chain heteroreceptor was examined 28 days after infarction using mice deficient in c-beta-chain.\nTwenty-four hours after darbepoetin, mRNAs encoding haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), iNOS and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were markedly elevated only in infarcted regions, and the frequency of apoptotic cells attenuated. Inflammation was also attenuated with reductions in neutrophil numbers. Darbepoetin also elevated mRNAs encoding angiogenic factors: placental growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1beta. Twenty-eight days after treatment, CD31+ vessels in the infarct zone doubled and fibrosis reduced. Cardiac haemodynamics were improved.

In this study, we investigated the growth behaviour and the ability to form focal adhesions on the substrate, using vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein, as a marker. Moreover, the expression of bone specific proteins and growth factors such as type I collagen, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), BMP-7 and de novo synthesis of osteocalcin in normal human osteoblasts (NHOst) seeded on xenogenic GBO were evaluated. Our observations suggest that after four weeks of culture in differentiation medium, the NHOst showed a high affinity for the three dimensional biomaterial; in fact, cellular proliferation, migration and colonization were clearly evident. The osteogenic differentiation process, as demonstrated by morphological, histochemical, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis and biochemical analysis was mostly obvious in the NHOst grown on three-dimensional inorganic bovine bone biomaterial. Functional studies displayed a clear and significant response to calcitonin when the cells were differentiated. In addition, the presence of the biomaterial improved the response, suggesting that it could drive the differentiation of these cells towards a more differentiated osteogenic phenotype.

In this study, we report that approximately 10,000 T cells gene-engineered to express a single-chain IL-12 molecule can be therapeutically effective against established tumors in the absence of exogenous IL-2 and vaccine. Although IL-12-engineered cells did not perist long-term in hosts, they exhibited enhanced functionality and were detected in higher numbers intratumorally along with increased numbers of endogenous natural killer and CD8(+) T cells just before regression. Importantly, transferred T cells isolated from tumors stably overproduced supraphysiologic amounts of IL-12, and the therapeutic effect of IL-12 produced within the tumor microenvironment could not be mimicked with high doses of exogenously provided IL-12. Furthermore, antitumor effects could be recapitulated by engineering wild-type open-repertoire splenocytes to express both the single-chain IL-12 and a recombinant tumor-specific T-cell receptor (TCR), but only when individual cells expressed both the TCR and IL-12, indicating that arrested migration of T cells at the tumor site was required for their activities. Successful tumor eradication was dependent on a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen that reduced the number of intratumoral CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells.

The brood pouches of both species are highly vascularized structures with cup-like arrangements of brood-pouch vasculature developing around each embryo shortly after fertilization and breaking down before fry release. The density and size of paternally derived blood vessels in contact with the embryos were found to be consistent for S. fuscus once this structure was established early in development. On the contrary, these vasculature measurements varied with early S. floridae brood stages when the embryo still relied heavily on the yolk sac. Diameter measurements of S. fuscus brood-pouch blood vessels were also comparatively smaller during these early developmental stages, suggesting that the structural stability and opportunity for greater transport via slower blood flow may contribute to greater paternal allocation.

Transplanting cells into chicken embryos can also be a step towards transplantation experiments in other animal models. Recently the chicken embryo has been used to evaluate the neurogenic potential of human stem and progenitor cells following implantation into neural anlage. In this video we document the entire procedure for transplanting human stem cells into the developing central nervous system of the chicken embryo. The procedure starts with incubation of fertilized eggs until embryos of the desired age have developed. The eggshell is then opened, and the embryo contrasted by injecting dye between the embryo and the yolk. Small lesions are made in the neural tube using microsurgery, creating a regenerative site for cell deposition that promotes subsequent integration into the host tissue. We demonstrate injections of human stem cells into such lesions made in the part of the neural tube that forms the hindbrain and the spinal cord, and into the lumen of the part of the neural tube that forms the brain. Systemic injections into extraembryonic veins and arteries are also demonstrated as an alternative way to deliver cells to vascularized tissues including the central nervous system.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the expression of markers of vascularization/angiogenesis, a marker of intercellular communication, and cellular proliferation and apoptosis in follicles from the penultimate and final waves. On day 8 of the estrous cycle, 15 ewes were administered a single injection of PGF(2\u03b1) and an intravaginal MAP sponge, which remained in place for 6 days. Two days after sponge removal, ovaries which contained follicles from the penultimate and final waves were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry followed by image analysis, and for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Expression of factor VIII (marker of vascularization), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and GJA1 (Cx43; marker of gap junctional communication) was greater (P<0.05) in follicles from the final wave compared with follicles from the penultimate wave. For theca cells, mRNA expression for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was greater (P<0.05) and tended to be greater (P\u22640.1 and \u22650.05) for GJA1 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in follicles from the final wave compared with follicles from the penultimate wave.

In addition we measured placental volume, placental quotient, PAPP-A, as well as uterine artery at 12 and 22 weeks (mean PI and mean notch) and compared those data with the pregnancy outcome.\nData from 383 women could be evaluated. 10 developed pre-eclampsia (PE). Both flow and vascularization were markedly lower in the placentas compared to the adjoining decidua and myometria. There was some correlation between placental vascularization Index (PVI) as well as deciduo-myometrial vascularization index (MVI) and placental volume, PAPP-A and number of pregnancies and a marked correlation between PVI and especially MVI to mean notch at 12 weeks and 22 weeks (PVI: -0.215, -0.274 MVI: -0.316,-0.322). PVI and MVI were significantly reduced in women with pregnancy problems and showed the greatest reduction in PE-pregnancies (p: 0.0018, 0.0004). Of all measured parameters MVI showed the best sensitivity for the detection of PE.\nThe correlation between PVI and MVI in the first trimester and mean notch in the second shows that they provide valuable information at as early as 12 weeks which normally so far is only available at 22 weeks by uterine artery Doppler flow. As MVI measures the percentage of vessels in the deciduo-myometrial area it could also provide information on trophoblast invasion.

{"title": "[Heart valve and myocardial tissue engineering].", "abstract": "Cardiac function, including the heart muscle and valves, can be severely altered by congenital and acquired heart diseases. Several graft materials are currently used to replace diseased cardiac tissue and valvular segments. Implantable grafts are either non-vital or can trigger an immune response which leads to graft calcification and degeneration. None of the existing grafts have the ability to remodel and grow in tandem with the physiological growth of a child and therefore require re-operation. Novel approaches such as tissue engineering have emerged as possible alternatives for cardiac reconstruction. The main concept of tissue engineering includes the use of biological and artificial scaffolds that form the shape of the organ structures for subsequent tissue replacement, which will provide absolute biocompatibility, no thrombogenicity, no teratogenicity, long-term durability and growth.Heart valve tissue engineering represents an important field especially in pediatric patients with valve pathologies. In order to create an autologous valve equivalent myofibroblasts and/or endothelial cells are seeded on specially designed scaffolds. Here we describe the different types of cell sources and different types of matrices currently used in heart valve tissue engineering. Valve manufacture is carried out in specially designed bioreactors providing physiological conditions. The number of clinical studies using tissue engineered valves is still limited; however, several promising results have already demonstrated their durability and ability to grow.Myocardial tissue engineering aims to repair, replace and regenerate damaged cardiac tissue using tissue constructs created ex vivo. Conceivable indications for clinical application of tissue engineered myocardial-implant substitutes include ischemic cardiomyopathies, as well as right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in patients with congenital heart diseases. Therapeutic application of functional (contractile) tissue engineered heart muscle appears feasible once key issues such as identification of the suitable human cell source, large scale expansion and suitable scaffolds are solved. In addition, the present article discusses the importance of vascularization as an important prerequisite for successful bio-artificial myocardial tissue.Further experimental and clinical research on cardiovascular tissue engineering is felt to be of great importance for others as well as for us in order to create an ideal heart valve/myocardial substitute and help our patients with advanced cardiac pathologies.", "journal": "Herz", "date": "2010-07-16", "authors": ["SergheiCebotari", "IgorTudorache", "TobiasSchilling", "AxelHaverich"], "doi": "10.1007/s00059-010-3355-x"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis and progression in human melanoma.", "abstract": "In tumor growth, angiogenesis, the process of new-formation of blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is uncontrolled and unlimited in time. The vascular phase is characterized by the new-formation of vascular channels that enhances tumor cell proliferation, local invasion and hematogenous metastasis. Human malignant melanoma is a highly metastatic tumor with poor prognosis, and high resistance to treatment. Parallel with progression, melanoma acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing number of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall, favouring tumor cell extravasation and metastases. Melanoma neovascularization has been correlated with poor prognosis, overall survival, ulceration and increased rate of relapse. Secretion of various angiogenic cytokines, i.e. VEGF-A, FGF-2, PGF-1 and -2, IL-8, and TGF-1 by melanoma cells promote the angiogenic switch and has been correlated to transition from the radial to the vertical growth phase, and to the metastatic phase. Moreover, melanoma cells overexpress alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, alpha2beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins and release, together with stromal cells, higher amount of metalloproteases that increasing their invasive potential and angiogenesis.

Disruption of the proangiogenic interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with its receptor (VEGFR-2) has been reported to \"normalize\" tumor vasculature, enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents by increasing their delivery to the tumor intersitium. We thus sought to determine whether disrupting VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling could enhance the effectiveness of ACT in a murine cancer model. The administration of an antibody against mouse VEGF synergized with ACT to enhance inhibition of established, vascularized, B16 melanoma (P = 0.009) and improve survival (P = 0.003). Additive effects of an antibody against VEGFR-2 in conjunction with ACT were seen in this model (P = 0.013). Anti-VEGF, but not anti-VEGFR-2, antibody significantly increased infiltration of transferred cells into the tumor. Thus, normalization of tumor vasculature through disruption of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis can increase extravasation of adoptively transferred T cells into the tumor and improve ACT-based immunotherapy.

The resulting vasculature structurally mimicked normal vessels with intensive pericyte coverage. Increases in vascularized areas within VPC-injected xenografts were visualized with an ultrasound diagnostic system during injection of a microbubble-based contrast agent (Sonazoid), indicating a functional \"normalization\" of the tumor vasculature. In addition, gene expression profiles in the VPC-transplanted xenografts revealed a marked reduction in major factors involved in drug resistance and \"stemness\" of cancer cells.

{"title": "Adipose tissue-derived progenitors for engineering osteogenic and vasculogenic grafts.", "abstract": "The current need for bone grafts in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery cannot be satisfied by autologous tissue transplant due to its limited availability and significant associated morbidity. Tissue engineering approaches could supply sufficient amounts of bone substitutes by exploiting the ability to harvest autologous osteogenic progenitors associated with suitable porous materials. However, the generation of clinically relevant-sized constructs is critically hampered by limited vascularization, with consequent engraftment and survival only of a thin outer shell, upon in vivo implantation. To overcome this limitation, different non-mutually exclusive approaches have recently been developed to promote or accelerate graft vascularization, from angiogenic growth factor gene delivery to surgical pre-vascularization of the construct before implantation. A simple, promising strategy involves the co-culture of vasculogenic cells to form an intrinsic vascular network inside the graft in vitro, which can rapidly anastomose with the host blood vessels in vivo. Recent data have shown that adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) may provide an efficient, convenient, and autologous source for both osteogenic and endothelial cells. When SVF progenitors were cultured in appropriate bioreactor systems and ectopically implanted, a functional vascular network connected to the host was formed concomitantly to bone formation. Future studies should aim at demonstrating that this approach effectively supports survival of scaled up cell-based bone grafts at an orthotopic site.

{"title": "Influence of \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate granule size and morphology on tissue reaction in vivo.", "abstract": "In this study the tissue reaction to five different \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP)-based bone substitute materials differing only in size, shape and porosity was analyzed over 60 days, at 3, 10, 15, 30 and 60 days after implantation. Using the subcutaneous implantation model in Wistar rats both the inflammatory response within the implantation bed and the resulting vascularization of the biomaterials were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by means of standard and special histological staining methods. The data from this study showed that all investigated \u03b2-TCP bone substitutes induced the formation of multinucleated giant cells. Changes in size, shape and porosity influenced the integration of the biomaterials within the implantation bed and the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive and TRAP-negative multinucleated giant cells, as well as the rate of vascularization. While a high porosity generally allowed cell and fiber in-growth within the center of the bone substitute, a lower porosity resulted in a mosaic-like integration of the materials, with the granules serving as place holders. The number of multinucleated giant cells located in the implantation bed positively correlated with the vascularization rate. These data emphasize that all biomaterials investigated were capable of inducing the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated giant cells as a sign of biomaterial stability. Furthermore, these cells directly influenced vascularization by secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as other chemokines. Based on these findings, the role of multinucleated giant cells in the foreign body reaction to biomaterials might need to be reconsidered. This study demonstrates that variations in the physical properties of a bone substitute material clearly influence the (extent of the) inflammatory reaction and its consequences.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["ShahramGhanaati", "MikeBarbeck", "CarinaOrth", "InesWillershausen", "Benjamin WThimm", "ChristianeHoffmann", "AngelaRasic", "Robert ASader", "Ronald EUnger", "FabianPeters", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2010.07.006"}

Blockade of DLL4-mediated Notch signaling strikingly increases nonproductive angiogenesis, but significantly inhibits tumor growth in preclinical mouse models. Thus, DLL4 has emerged as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Anti-DLL4 antibodies have recently entered clinical trials. However, the potential toxic effects of anti-DLL4 are poorly understood. In this article, Yan et al. reported that chronic DLL4 blockade abnormally activates endothelial cells, causes pathological changes of multiple organs and induces vascular neoplasms.

Tumor angiogenesis is the result of a complex interplay between tumor cells, endothelial cells, and other stromal cells. It has been found to be under strict control of a plethora of molecular factors that function as angiogenic up- and down-regulators; nevertheless, the identification of molecular and cellular players and their roles in angiogenesis is still ongoing. The microvasculature resulting from tumor angiogenesis lacks hierarchy and has a high permeability for macromolecules and nanoparticles, which offers significant potential for nanoparticulate tumor imaging and drug delivery platforms. However, improvements in the delivery to poorly vascularized regions and the distribution throughout the tumor interstitium are critical for nanoparticles to become more effective in the battle against cancer. A tool that has proven extremely valuable in both unraveling angiogenic pathways and characterizing in vivo nanoparticle behavior in solid tumors is intravital microscopy of tumors grown in window chamber preparations. In this review this technique is explained, several exciting examples illustrating its value in elucidating tumor angiogenesis are presented and the study of nanoparticle behavior in solid tumors using this approach is described.

PCB153 is one of the most commonly found polychlorinated biphenyls, and based on epidemiological studies, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The endocrine disruptor PCB153 has been reported to bind the estrogen receptor alpha, induce vessel formation, and increase the formation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Since PCB153-induced phenotypic changes are similar to estradiol, we postulated that PCB153 activates redox signaling pathways common to 17\u03b2-estradiol. Whether the effect of PCB153 on the proteome is comparable to 17\u03b2-estradiol is not known. Therefore we investigated the proteome of human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to PCB153 (100\u00a0ng/ml) for 24\u00a0h. Using 2D DIGE coupled to MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF MS, we found 96 protein spots significantly (greater than 1.5-fold) modulated by experimental treatments. Mass spectrometry identified 11 of 13 protein spots with high confidence protein score CI that was greater than 95%. Of the identified proteins, lamin A/C and far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1) were regulated similarly by both treatments. FUBP1 is of particular interest because it controls c-myc. While lamin A/C modulates transcription factor AP-1 function. Interestingly, both c-myc and AP-1 are redox-sensitive transcription factors known to regulate genes required for cell growth. Network analysis of these proteins showed transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 and c-myc to play central roles. While our findings do not reveal any mechanisms involved in PCB153-induced vascularization, the identified network does provide a potential target pathway for further mechanistic studies of these relationships.", "journal": "Cell biology and toxicology", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["QuentinFelty"], "doi": "10.1007/s10565-010-9170-6"}

Here, we extend the vascular model through the capillary bed and the entire coronary venous system. The reconstruction was based on comprehensive morphometric data previously measured in the porcine heart. The reconstruction was formulated as a large-scale optimization process, subject to both global constraints relating to the location of the larger veins and to local constraints of measured morphological features. The venous network was partitioned into epicardial, transmural, and perfusion functional subnetworks. The epicardial portion was generated by a simulated annealing search for the optimal coverage of the area perfused by the arterial epicardial vessels. The epicardial subnetwork and coronary arterial capillary network served as boundary conditions for the reconstruction of the in-between transmural and perfusion networks, which were generated to optimize vascular homogeneity. Five sets of full coronary trees, which spanned the entire network down to the capillary level, were reconstructed. The total number of reconstructed venous segments was 17,148,946 \u00b1 1,049,498 (n = 5), which spanned the coronary sinus (order -12) to the first segment of the venous capillary (order 0v). Combined with the reconstructed arterial network, the number of vessel segments for the entire coronary network added up to 27,307,376 \u00b1 1,155,359 (n = 5).

However, following injection of dissociated cells, a massive loss of transplanted cells has been reported. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) were used as the cell source for the fabrication of cell sheet fragments, using a thermo-responsive methylcellulose hydrogel system. The fabricated hAFSC sheet fragments preserved the endogenous extracellular matrices (ECM) and retained their cell phenotype. Test samples were xenogenically transplanted into the peri-ischemic area of an immune-suppressed rat model at 1 week after myocardial infarction (MI) induction. There were four treatment groups (n>=10): sham; saline; dissociated hAFSCs; and hAFSC sheet fragments. The results obtained in the echocardiography revealed that the group treated with hAFSC sheet fragments had a superior heart function to those treated with saline or dissociated hAFSCs. Due to their inherent ECM, hAFSC sheet fragments had a better ability of cell retention and proliferation than dissociated hAFSCs upon transplantation to the host myocardium. Additionally, transplantation of hAFSC sheet fragments stimulated a significant increase in vascular density, consequently contributing towards improved wall thickness and a reduction in the infarct size, when compared with dissociated hAFSCs.

To address this limitation, we designed a novel continuous polymer coating system to provide sustained localized delivery of pharmacological agent, FTY720, a selective agonist for sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors, within massive tibial defects. In vitro drug release studies validated 64% loading efficiency with complete release of compound following 14 days. Mechanical evaluation following six weeks of healing suggested significant enhancement of mechanical stability in FTY720 treatment groups compared with unloaded controls. Furthermore, superior osseous integration across the host-graft interface, significant enhancement in smooth muscle cell investment, and reduction in leukocyte recruitment was evident in FTY720 treated groups compared with untreated groups. Using this approach, we can capitalize on the existing mechanical and biomaterial properties of devitalized bone, add a controllable delivery system while maintaining overall porous structure, and deliver a small molecule compound to constitutively target vascular remodeling, osseous remodeling, and minimize fibrous encapsulation within the allograft-host bone interface.

We have previously shown that human microcapillary endothelial cells (HDMEC) and primary human osteoblast cells (HOS) in coculture on various 3-D bone biomaterial scaffolds rapidly distribute and self-assemble into a morphological structure resembling bone tissue. Endothelial cells form microcapillary-like structures containing a lumen and these were intertwined between the osteoblast cells and the biomaterial. This tissue-like self-assembly occurred in the absence of exogenously added angiogenic stimuli or artificial matrices. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this in vitro pre-formed microvasculature persists and functions in vivo and to determine how the host responds to the cell-containing scaffolds. The scaffolds with cocultures were implanted into immune-deficient mice and compared to scaffolds without cells or with HDMEC alone. Histological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining with human-specific antibodies of materials removed 14 days after implantation demonstrated that the in vitro pre-formed microcapillary structures were present on the silk fibroin scaffolds and showed a perfused lumen that contained red blood cells. This proved anastomosis with the host vasculature. Chimeric vessels in which HDMEC were integrated with the host's ingrowing (murine) capillaries were also observed. No HDMEC-derived microvessel structures or chimeric vessels were observed on implanted silk fibroin when precultured with HDMEC alone. In addition, there was migration of the host (murine) vasculature into the silk fibroin scaffolds implanted with cocultures, whereas silk fibroin alone or silk fibroin precultured only with HDMEC were nearly devoid of ingrowing host microcapillaries. Therefore, not only do the in vitro pre-formed microcapillaries in a coculture survive and anastomose with the host vasculature to become functioning microcapillaries after implantation, the coculture also stimulates the host capillaries to rapidly grow into the scaffold to vascularize the implanted material. Thus, this coculture-based pre-vascularization of a biomaterial implant may have great potential in the clinical setting to treat large bone defects.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["Ronald EUnger", "ShahramGhanaati", "CarinaOrth", "AnneSartoris", "MikeBarbeck", "SvenHalstenberg", "AntonellaMotta", "ClaudioMigliaresi", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.057"}

In order to construct such a co-culture system, we attempted to create a hydrogel scaffold which could induce neo-tissue growth from the recipient bed into the material. This material would enable encapsulation of stem cells in vitro after which they could be transferred to an in vivo system utilizing nude mice. In this case, the hydrogel was implanted in the subfascial space of nude mice and excised 4 weeks later. Cross-sections of the excised samples were stained with von Kossa or safranin-O and tubular formations into the gel were observed with and tested by doppler imaging. The data showed that the hydrogel markedly induced growth of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and vascular-rich tissue into the hydrogel by 4 weeks, which surpassed that after transplantation in a co-culture system.

These results show that the transient down-regulation of VEGF-A mRNA and protein closely parallels the ligand-induced down-regulation of LHR mRNA.

Several occlusion levels were applied, from 0 to 100%, simultaneously with 3D Doppler acquisitions of several placentomes, using standardized settings. Each placentome was analyzed using VOCAL\u2122 (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) software. The correlation between true blood flow and Doppler indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) was evaluated, together with measurement reproducibility.\nForty-eight acquisitions were analyzed. All 3D Doppler indices were significantly correlated with true blood flow.

Intravitreous injection of bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, has recently been advocated as an adjunct in surgery for PDR. In this context, a clinically observed decrease in PDR epiretinal membrane vascularity (vascular regression) occurs from 24 hours to 48 hours after injection, but the exact mechanisms of drug action are unknown.\nA consecutive series of seven PDR membrane specimens that had been removed sequentially from seven bevacizumab-treated patients were studied retrospectively. The membrane specimens were examined using light microscopic methods, including immunohistochemistry.\nFive of the seven membranes were clinically avascular (one contained \"ghost\" vessels) and did not hemorrhage during excision. Of these 5 specimens, which included 1 removed 7 days after a total of 6 intravitreous injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab, 4 contained histologically detectable capillaries (1 did not). These blood vessels were lined by endothelial cells as determined by immunohistochemistry for the endothelial markers CD31 and CD34. The two remaining membranes were clinically and histologically still vascularized despite bevacizumab treatment. All the specimens also contained smooth muscle actin-containing fibroblastic cells within the collagenous stroma.\nThe findings do not support the concept that the clinical phenomenon of vascular regression in PDR membranes after bevacizumab injection in the vitreous is resulting from obliteration of the membrane blood vessels.

The vessel-type separation method is based on the fact that the spectral distribution of intrinsic physiological oscillations varies from arterial regions to venous regions. In arterial regions, the spectral power is higher in the heartbeat frequency (HF), whereas in venous regions, the spectral power is higher in the respiration frequency (RF). The separation method was begun by extracting the vascular network and its centerline. Then the spectra of the optical intrinsic signals were estimated by the multitaper method. A standard F-test was performed on each discrete frequency point to test the statistical significance at the given level. Four periodic physiological oscillations were examined: HF, RF, and two other eigenfrequencies termed F1 and F2. The separation of arteries and veins was implemented with the fuzzy c-means clustering method and the region-growing approach by utilizing the spectral amplitudes and power-ratio values of the four eigenfrequencies on the vasculature.

We have previously shown that PEDF can be phosphorylated and that distinct phosphorylation states of this factor differentially regulate its physiologic function. Here, we report that phosphomimetic mutants of PEDF, which possess significantly increased antiangiogenic activity, are much more efficient than wild-type (WT) PEDF in inhibiting growth and neovascularization in MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), and U87-MG (glioblastoma) xenograft models. Importantly, the antitumor activity of the phosphomimetic mutants is comparable with that of the established antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. However, unlike bevacizumab, these compounds act in a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-independent manner, as they do not affect the levels of VEGF-A mRNA and VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation. Further immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PEDF mutants affect mainly tumor-residing endothelial cells and prevent the formation of intratumoral vascular network by facilitating endothelial cell apoptosis. It was also found that PEDF mutants reduce survival of endothelial cells in culture much better than WT-PEDF, an effect that is apparent even in the presence of VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor, and promote much stronger endothelial cell apoptosis. On the other hand, PEDF and its mutants did not affect survival of cultured cancer cells, indicating that the antiangiogenic activity of these agents is the foremost element of the observed antitumor effect.

{"title": "A novel composite construct increases the vascularization potential of PEG hydrogels through the incorporation of large fibrin ribbons.", "abstract": "Developing a mechanism to vascularize tissue-engineered constructs is imperative for transplant function and integration, particularly when delivering hypoxia-sensitive tissues, such as pancreatic islets. Previous efforts have focused on bulk modifications of scaffold materials rendering the entire construct permissive to vessel penetration or the formation of a porous structure where vessels can infiltrate the empty spaces. Here, we describe a novel construct composed of large fibrin ribbons encapsulated within a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. The PEG/fibrin ribbon composite scaffold facilitates coculture of adhesive and nonadhesive cell types, thus providing closely neighboring environments with distinct material properties specific to the needs of two clinically relevant cell populations. This advantage is demonstrated here by the successful coculture of pancreatic islets in the PEG component and vessel-forming endothelial cells in entrapped fibrin ribbons. Transplanted endothelial cells can form anastomosies with host vasculature, suggesting that our cocultures may lead to more rapid scaffold vascularization. Additionally, we show that surface-seeded endothelial cells form multicellular projections that migrate into nonadhesive PEG hydrogels along permissive fibrin ribbons, further demonstrating composite construct vascularization potential. Distribution of large fibrin ribbons throughout PEG hydrogels provide a potential mechanism for vascularization of a well-established biomaterial without inherently changing its desirable properties.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The emerging tumor vasculature is non-hierarchical, compartmentalized into well-characterized zones, displays a complex geometry with necrotic zones and \"hot spots\" of increased vascular density and blood flow of varying size, and transports drug injections efficiently.

The PIS was divided into three segments from the crux cordis to the notch of the cardiac apex according to the American Heart Association classification (basal, mid ventricular and apical), and the artery or arteries supplying each segment were recorded. The relative frequency of the different vascularization patterns was calculated and the distribution of dominance types was recorded.\nBlood was supplied to the PIS by one or more branches of the right coronary artery (RCA), the left circumflex artery (LCX), or the left anterior descending artery (LAD). We observed 25 different irrigation patterns. In the most frequent pattern (31.3%), the basal and mid-ventricular segments were perfused by a single arterial branch originating from the RCA at the crux, and the apical segment was perfused by the LAD traveling beyond the notch of the cardiac apex and entering the posterior interventricular sulcus. Of the 356 cases, the circulation was right dominant in 310 (87.1%), left dominant in 34 (9.5%), and balanced in 12 (3.4%) cases. Individual segments were perfused by a single artery in 288 (80.9%) cases, and by more than one in the remainder.\nCCTA allows detailed assessment of the arterial supply of the PIS, and allowed to describe 25 subtypes.

Seven patients developed claw toe deformity in the donor side foot after the harvesting of a vascularized fibula graft. They comprised 5 males and 2 females with an average age of 29 years (range: 6-59 years). The affected toes in 6 patients were 1 and 2, or 1, 2, and 3. All toes were affected in the remaining patient. Four patients underwent Z-lengthening of the flexor hallucis longus at the medial malleolus of the ankle, while 3 underwent cutting of the tendons. The average time between harvesting a fibula graft and development of claw toe deformity was 13 months (range: 2.5-42 months), and the average follow-up time was 30 months (range: 10-47 months). Claw deformity of affected toes was successfully corrected in all patients by release of the flexor hallucis longus. Full extension of the affected toes was achieved by the time of final follow-up. Flexion of the interphalangeal joint was preserved in all patients except one who underwent cutting of the tendon beneath the metatarsophalangeal joint.

{"title": "RKTG inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing MAPK-mediated autocrine VEGF signaling and is downregulated in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are crucial regulators of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The autocrine VEGF signaling is required for maintaining the homeostasis of vasculature. Dysregulation of angiogenesis is implicated in the development of many human cancers, especially in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a highly vascularized tumor. Meanwhile, antiangiogenesis has become a mainstay in the treatment of human cancers. In this study, we analyzed the functional roles of RKTG (Raf Kinase Trapping to Golgi), a negative regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) signaling, by sequestration of Raf kinase to the Golgi apparatus, in angiogenesis and ccRCC. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we found that RKTG has a negative effect on cell proliferation, migration, sprouting and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. RKTG, by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, negatively regulates the transactivation activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) by inhibiting formation of HIF-1\u03b1/p300 complex and suppressing VEGF transcription, thereby reducing hypoxia-induced VEGF production. The expression level of RKTG is significantly downregulated in clinical ccRCC tumor samples, with an inverse correlation with VEGF expression level. These results highlight the functional roles of RKTG and its regulated Raf/ERK/MEK signaling cascade in angiogenesis and autocrine VEGF signaling. In addition, this study indicates that RKTG is likely implicated in the development of ccRCC through its regulation on angiogenesis.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2010-07-07", "authors": ["YZhang", "XJiang", "XQin", "DYe", "ZYi", "MLiu", "OBai", "WLiu", "XXie", "ZWang", "JFang", "YChen"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2010.270"}

In cancer, Met can act as an oncogene on tumor cells, as well as a pro-angiogenic factor activating endothelial cells and inducing new vessel formation. Molecules interfering with Met activity could be valuable therapeutic agents. Here we have investigated the antiangiogenic properties of a synthetic peptide mimicking the docking site of the Met carboxyl-terminal tail, which was delivered into the cells by fusion with the internalization sequences from Antennapedia or HIV-Tat. We showed that these peptides inhibit ligand-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, motility, invasiveness and morphogenesis in vitro to an even greater extent and with much less toxicity than the Met inhibitor PHA-665752, which correlated with interference of HGF-dependent downstream signaling. In vivo, the peptides inhibited HGF-induced angiogenesis in the matrigel sponge assay and impaired xenograft tumor growth and vascularization in Kaposi's sarcoma.

Apc(+/Min) mice when crossed with Ink4a/arf-/- mice, exhibited increased angiogenesis of colorectal tumors suggesting that dysregulation of Cdk4 (due to loss of Ink4a-mediated suppression) may contribute to enhanced angiogenesis. To demonstrate a direct role for Cdk4 in angiogenesis, we crossed mice that have an activated Cdk4, Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice, with Apc(+/Min) mice and examined levels of angiogenesis in intestinal tumors formed. Our results show an increase in the percentage of highly vascularized tumors in Cdk4(R24C/R24C):Apc(Min/+) and Cdk4(+/R24C):Apc(Min/+) mice compared to Cdk4(+/+):Apc(Min/+) mice. In addition immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase in CD-31 staining localized to endothelial cells of Cdk4(R24C/R24C):Apc(Min/+) mouse tumors, supporting the hypothesis of increased vasculature in these tumors. Further analysis showed an increase in the expression of the E2F1 target proteins Vegf-b and Cyclin A in Cdk4(R24C/R24C):Apc(+/Min) intestinal tumors. Together these data suggest that the dysregulated Cdk4 gene plays an important role in angiogenesis during intestinal tumor formation and may in part act via increasing E2F1 target proteins.

The region in which the microbubbles were destroyed with focused ultrasound was quantified in gel phantoms as a function of pressure, number of cycles and type of microbubble. At 2MPa the destruction took place in a fairly wide area for a lipid-shelled agent, while for polymer-shelled agents at this setting, distinct destruction spots with a radius of only 1mm were obtained. When microbubbles with a thicker shell were used, the pressure above which the bubbles were destroyed shifts to higher values. In vivo both lipid and polymer microbubbles increased the extravasation of the albumin binding dye Evans Blue, especially in muscle leading to about 6-8% of the injected dose to extravasate per gram muscle tissue 30 min after start of the treatment, while no Evans Blue could be detected in muscle in the absence of microbubbles. Variation in the time between ultrasound treatment and Evans Blue injection, demonstrated that the time window for promoting extravasation is at least an hour at the settings used. In MC38 tumors, extravasation already occurred without ultrasound and only a trend towards enhancement with about a factor of 2 could be established with a maximum percentage injected dose per gram of 3%.

Microscopic visualization of intestinal microvasculature under normal and pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. Despite the intensive need to characterize the intestinal microstructure and vasculature in an integrated fashion, 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of the gastrointestinal tissue is often limited by the spatial resolution of the imaging tools. In this research, we aimed to apply optical clearing to minimize the random light scattering in the mouse ileum, thereby facilitating photon penetration for high-resolution, 3D optical microscopy of the tissue network without microtome sectioning. We applied cardiac perfusion of lipophilic dialkylcarbocyanine dye DiD (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate) to label the mouse blood vessels, including the intestinal microvasculature. The labeled and paraformaldehyde-fixed ileum was immersed in the aqueous optical-clearing solution to improve photon penetration. Optical clearing revealed the interior domain of the mouse ileal mucosa and submucosa, where random light scattering was suppressed and the size of the microstructure in the fixed specimen remained the same.

When the NG2 proteoglycan is absent from pericyte surfaces, vascularization of syngeneic tumors growing in the C57Bl/6 mouse brain is aberrant in several respects, resulting in retardation of tumor progression. In the NG2 null mouse brain, pericyte investment of the tumor vascular endothelium is reduced, causing deficiencies in both pericyte and endothelial cell maturation, as well as reduced basal lamina assembly. While part of this deficit may be due to the previously-identified role of NG2 in beta1 integrin-dependent periyte/endothelial cell crosstalk, the ablation of NG2 also appears responsible for loss of collagen VI anchorage, in turn leading to reduced collagen IV deposition. Poor functionality of tumor vessels in NG2 null brain is reflected by reduced vessel patency and increased vessel leakiness, resulting in large increases in tumor hypoxia.

Hematoxylin and eosin or immunohistochemical staining were utilized to quantify tumor necrosis, hypoxia (pimonidazole), vascularization (CD31), and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). The results showed that cryoablated tumors demonstrated significant delayed growth following treatment compared to controls.

Exclusion criteria were the same in both groups. We collected demographic data and symptoms. Ultrasonography (Esaote Technos machine, two sonographers) was performed in all participants in both groups and plain radiography in the patients only. The PIP and DIP joints on fingers 2 to 5 were evaluated. Ultrasound features were compared between the two groups.\nWe included 55 patients (51 women; 440 PIPs and 440 DIPs) and 46 healthy controls (368 PIPs and 368 DIPs). The rate of PIP joint effusion was similar in the two groups (patients, 2.05\u00b12.03; controls, 1.6\u00b11.7; P>0.05), whereas the rate of DIP effusion was significantly higher in the patients (2.09\u00b11.87 versus 0\u00b10.6 in the controls; P<0.05). Increased vascularization by Doppler evaluation was rare and occurred chiefly in the DIP joints of the patients. None of the participants in either group had synovitis.

{"title": "Angiogenesis: from chronic liver inflammation to hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Recently, new information relating to the potential relevance of chronic hepatic inflammation to the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been generated. Persistent hepatocellular injury alters the homeostatic balance within the liver; deregulation of the expression of factors involved in wound healing may lead to the evolution of dysplastic lesions into transformed nodules. Progression of such nodules depends directly on the development and organization of a vascular network, which provides the nutritional and oxygen requirements to an expanding nodular mass. Angiogenic stimulation promotes intense structural and functional changes in liver architecture and physiology, in particular, it facilitates transformation of dysplasia to nodular lesions with carcinogenic potential. HCC depends on the growth and spreading of vessels throughout the tumor. Because these vascular phenomena correlate with disease progression and prognosis, therapeutic strategies are being developed that focus on precluding vascular expansion in these tumors. Accordingly, an in-depth study of factors that promote and support pathological angiogenesis in chronic hepatic diseases may provide insights into methods of preventing the development of HCC and/or stimulating the regression of established HCC.", "journal": "Journal of oncology", "date": "2010-07-02", "authors": ["PalomaSanz-Cameno", "Mar\u00edaTrapero-Marug\u00e1n", "Mar\u00edaChaparro", "Evan AnthonyJones", "RicardoMoreno-Otero"], "doi": "10.1155/2010/272170"}

For instance, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) shows a similar uptake, storage and release as norepinephrine. Intravenously injected radiolabeled MIBG is able to reflect neuronal damage induced by inflammation and tumors. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the results and the limitation of these neuronal imaging techniques in patients with pulmonary and cardiac diseases and to give an opinion about the clinical value of these new diagnostic tools.\nMIBG neuronal images of the lungs and heart can show heterogeneous distribution patterns with either diminished or increased MIBG uptake and/or washout. These changes reflect changes in endothelial integrity, neuronal innervations and clearance of norepinephrine. Interest in the role of neurotransmitter involvement and the relation between endothelial cell integrity and vascularization is growing and of utmost importance to understand the effect on pathophysiology of diseases.\nAt this moment, there is no added clinical value to routinely use MIBG scanning of the lungs and the heart. This is partly due to the many unresolved questions such as what actually happens and which factors influence MIBG uptake and washout under normal physiological circumstances. But the technique, if standardized and when dynamic time acquisition is performed with the latest equipment, such as PET and single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT), has a tremendous potential.

{"title": "ADAMTS1 cleavage of versican mediates essential structural remodeling of the ovarian follicle and cumulus-oocyte matrix during ovulation in mice.", "abstract": "Remodeling of ovarian follicle extracellular matrix is essential for ovulation and vascularization of the corpus luteum (CL). Formation of the cumulus matrix around oocytes also plays an important role in ovulation and subsequent fertilization of oocytes. ADAMTS1 is an extracellular metalloprotease induced in ovarian follicles by ovulatory hormones and is required for fertility. In this study, we identified ADAMTS1-mediated structural and morphological changes in remodeling of the follicle and cumulus oocyte complex (COC). In Adamts1(-/-) mice, the ovulation rate was 77% reduced and fertilization of ovulated oocytes was reduced a further 63%, resulting in a reduced number of litters and pups per litter. Morphological assessment of peri-ovulatory ovaries revealed abnormal morphogenesis with a lack of thecal/vascular invagination in the basal region of follicles. Cleavage of the ADAMTS1 substrate, versican, at these invaginating regions was abundant in Adamts1(+/-) but undetectable in Adamts1(-/-) ovaries, indicating that processing of versican by ADAMTS1 is involved in ovulating follicle remodeling. Versican and hyaluronan localization was abnormal during COC matrix expansion, and versican persisted beyond the expected time of fertilization in Adamts1(-/-) but was catabolized and cleared from control COC. The results demonstrate that ADAMTS1 is critical in both ovulation and fertilization processes in vivo. The protease activity of ADAMTS1 mediates neomorphogenesis of the ovulating follicle wall and COC matrix necessary for successful ovulation and fertilization, as well as subsequent catabolism of versican required for degradation of COC matrix after fertilization.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2010-07-02", "authors": ["Hannah MBrown", "Kylie RDunning", "Rebecca LRobker", "DerekBoerboom", "MelaniePritchard", "MichelleLane", "Darryl LRussell"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.110.084434"}

All charts were reviewed retrospectively for tumor type, stage and location, surgical procedure performed (including type of plate used), dental restoration if done, the use of pre- or postoperative radiotherapy, length of follow-up, and evidence of complications.\nFibula osteocutaneous free flaps were used for reconstruction in 117 patients, of whom 60% were men (mean age, 57.1 years) and 40% were women (mean age, 56.6 years). Most cases (61.1%) were secondary to oral malignancies (89.1% of these were squamous cell carcinoma). Thirty-one patients (26.5%) developed postoperative complications, including hardware failure or intolerance in 16 patients (13.7%), total or partial flap failure in 10 patients (8.5%), wound infection in 3 patients (2.6%), and peroneal nerve damage in 2 patients (1.7%).

EG-VEGF is abundantly expressed in the highest vascularized organ, the human placenta. Here we characterized its angiogenic effect using different experimental procedures. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize EG-VEGF receptors (PROKR1 and PROKR2) in placental and umbilical cord tissue. Primary microvascular placental endothelial cell (HPEC) and umbilical vein-derived macrovascular EC (HUVEC) were used to assess its effects on proliferation, migration, cell survival, pseudovascular organization, spheroid sprouting, permeability and paracellular transport. siRNA and neutralizing antibody strategies were used to differentiate PROKR1- from PROKR2-mediated effects. Our results show that 1) HPEC and HUVEC express both types of receptors 2) EG-VEGF stimulates HPEC's proliferation, migration and survival, but increases only survival in HUVECs. and 3) EG-VEGF was more potent than VEGF in stimulating HPEC sprout formation, pseudovascular organization, and it significantly increases HPEC permeability and paracellular transport. More importantly, we demonstrated that PROKR1 mediates EG-VEGF angiogenic effects, whereas PROKR2 mediates cellular permeability. Altogether, these data characterized angiogenic processes mediated by EG-VEGF, depicted a new angiogenic factor in the placenta, and suggest a novel view of the regulation of angiogenesis in placental pathologies.", "journal": "Molecular biology of the cell", "date": "2010-07-01", "authors": ["SophieBrouillet", "PascaleHoffmann", "MohamedBenharouga", "AudeSalomon", "Jean-PatrickSchaal", "Jean-JacquesFeige", "NadiaAlfaidy"], "doi": "10.1091/mbc.E10-01-0059"}
{"title": "The scatter factor signaling pathways as therapeutic associated target in cancer treatment.", "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key regulators of critical cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, neo-vascularization, and tissue repair. In addition to their importance in the regulation of normal physiology, aberrant expression of certain RTKs has also been associated to the development and progression of many types of cancer. c-Met and RON are two RTKs with closely related sequences, structural homology, and similar functional properties. Both these receptors, once activated by their respective ligands, the Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF1) and the Macrophage Stimulating Protein/Scatter Factor 2 (MSP/SF2), can induce cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Soon after its discovery in the mid-1980s, c-Met attracted a great interest because of its role in modulating cell motility. Moreover, the causal role for c-Met activating mutations in human cancer propelled an intensive drug discovery effort throughout academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. While c-Met is now a well-accepted target for anticancer drug design, less is known about the role of RON in cancer and less has been done to target this receptor. In this review we will discuss the biological relevance of c-Met and RON, their deregulation in human cancers and the progress, so far, in identifying c-Met and RON signaling inhibitors.

Therefore, our aim was to study whether apelin expression is associated with angiogenesis and/or tumor growth/behavior in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nA total of 94 patients with stage I-IIIA NSCLC and complete follow-up information were included. Apelin expression in human NSCLC samples and cell lines was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry.

Morphometric variables of human and mouse tumor capillaries were determined by anti-CD31 labeling.\nApelin was expressed in all of the six investigated NSCLC cell lines both at the mRNA and protein levels. Although apelin overexpression or apelin treatments did not increase NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro, increasing apelin levels by gene transfer to NSCLC cells significantly stimulated tumor growth and microvessel densities and perimeters in vivo. Apelin mRNA levels were significantly increased in human NSCLC samples compared with normal lung tissue, and high apelin protein levels were associated with elevated microvessel densities and poor overall survival.\nThis study reveals apelin as a novel angiogenic factor in human NSCLC.

However, cell behavior is significantly impacted by signals from the local microenvironment. Therefore, we investigated how the combinatorial effect of the location of injection and procedural differences affected xenograft characteristics. Patient-derived breast cancer cells were injected into mouse abdominal or thoracic mammary glands +/- estrogen and/or etoposide pretreatment. Abdominal xenografts had increased tumor incidence and volume, and decreased latency (P < 0.001) compared to thoracic tumors. No statistically significant difference in tumor volume was found in abdominal xenografts treated +/- estrogen or etoposide; however, etoposide suppressed tumor volume in thoracic xenografts (P < 0.02). The combination of estrogen and etoposide significantly decreased tumor incidence in both sites. In addition, mice treated +/- estradiol were injected orthotopically or subcutaneously with well-characterized breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, ZR75-1, MDA MB-231, or MCF10Ca1h). Orthotopic injection increased tumor volume; growth varied with estrogen supplementation. Location also altered methylation status of several breast cancer-related gene promoters.

{"title": "Contrast ultrasonography: necessity of linear data processing for the quantification of tumor vascularization.", "abstract": "This study is intended to compare the value of uncompressed ultrasonic data, obtained after linear power detection of the ultrasonic radiofrequencies that we call linear data, with usual compressed video data for the quantification of tumor perfusion, particularly for monitoring antivascular therapy.\nTo form a clinically useful ultrasonic image, the detected power of the received signals (linear data) is compressed in a quasi-logarithmic fashion in order to match the limited dynamic range of the video monitor. The resulting reduced range of signals from an injected contrast agent may limit the sensitivity to changes in the time-intensity curves. Following a theoretical evaluation of the effects of compression on time-intensity curves and as an in vivo example, we measured at different times the effects of an antivascular drug administered to mice bearing melanoma tumors. The mean time-intensity curves within the tumors after bolus injection of a contrast agent were determined using both linear and video data. Linearized data was recovered using the inverse of the true scanner's compression law, which was experimentally determined. Three features were extracted from the time-intensity curves: peak intensity (PI), time to peak intensity (TPI) and area under the curve in the wash-in phase (AUC (wash-in)). When contrast reached its maximum value, the coefficient of variation reflecting the heterogeneity of the intensity of contrast uptake within the tumor, was computed using both data sets.\nTPI was found to be similar with either data set (r = 0.98, p < 0.05, factor of 1.09). Linear PI and AUC (wash-in) had significantly earlier decreases after drug administration than video data (p = 0.015 and p = 0.03, respectively). The coefficient of variation was significantly lower when using video rather than linear data (p < 10 (-4)).\nIn conclusion, the use of linear data is the only mathematically valid methodology for determining a tumor's time-intensity curve and, in practice, it allows earlier demonstration of responses to antivascular drugs.", "journal": "Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)", "date": "2010-06-26", "authors": ["PPeronneau", "NLassau", "ILeguerney", "ARoche", "DCosgrove"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0029-1245450"}

In most approaches, a temporary porous scaffold is required to support tissue regeneration. The scaffold should be designed such that the turnover synchronizes with tissue remodeling and regeneration at the implant site. Segmented polyester urethanes (PUs) used in this study were based on epsilon-caprolactone (CL) and co-monomers D,L-lactide (D,L-L) and gamma-butyrolactone (BL), and 1,4-butanediisocyanate (BDI). In vitro, the PUs were nontoxic and haemocompatible. To test in vivo biocompatibility, the PUs were further processed into porous structures and subcutaneously implanted in rats for a period up to 21 days. Tissue remodeling and scaffold turnover was associated with a mild tissue response. The tissue response was characterized by extensive vascularization through the interconnected pores, with low numbers of macrophages on the edges and stroma formation inside the pores of the implants. The tissue ingrowth appeared to be related to the extent of microphase separation of the PUs and foam morphology. By day 21, all of the PU implants were highly vascularized, confirming the pores were interconnected.

Tissue sections from 10 adenomas, 8 ANs and 13 PC and surrounding tissue of 10 PCs and 2 benign nodules were immunostained for CD34. A computerized image analysis was used to determine the microvessel density in four hot spots and ten systematically selected fields.

The analysis of the CFDS-classification IV for the distinction between PCs and adenomas and ANs showed a sensitivity of 62% with a specificity of 100%. The lower sensitivity of the CFDS classification as compared with the immunohistologic determination of the microvessel density indicates that the CFDS classification detects the pathognomonic intranodular microvessels only incompletely.

It allows for enhanced sensitivity to contrast agents and superior image quality in spatial resolution. Iodine and barium sulfate were used as blood vessel contrast agents. Physiological features of whole-body mouse microvasculature were investigated using synchrotron radiation for the first time. The intracranial vascular network and other blood vessels were observed clearly, and the related anatomy and vessel diameters were studied. Dynamic angiography in mouse brain was performed with a high spatial image resolution of around 20-30 microm. Future research will focus on the development of novel specific targeting contrast agents for blood vessel imaging in vivo with a long half-life and fewer side effects.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2010-06-23", "authors": ["PingLiu", "JianqiSun", "JunZhao", "XiaoxiaLiu", "XiangGu", "JingLi", "TiqiaoXiao", "Lisa XXu"], "doi": "10.1107/S0909049510018832"}

{"title": "Emerging clinical principles on the use of bevacizumab for the treatment of malignant gliomas.", "abstract": "Despite advances in adjuvant therapy, the prognosis for most patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, and almost all HGGs have a likelihood of disease recurrence. HGGs are highly vascularized tumors with elevated expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important mediator of angiogenesis. A compelling biologic rationale, a pressing need for improved therapeutics and positive results from studies of bevacizumab in other tumor types, led to the evaluation of bevacizumab in the treatment of HGG. It was demonstrated previously that bevacizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, improved outcomes when combined with chemotherapy (most commonly irinotecan) in patients with recurrent HGG; and, on the basis of an improved objective response rate in 2 prospective phase 2 studies, bevacizumab was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration as a single agent in patients with previously treated glioblastoma (GB). Bevacizumab-containing therapy has been associated with manageable, class-specific toxicity; however, severe treatment-related adverse events are observed in a minority of patients. Preliminary data on bevacizumab-based therapy in recurrent anaplastic gliomas, in the frontline treatment of GB, and in additional patient populations are also encouraging. With the goal of addressing unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of bevacizumab, the objective of the current review was to provide a summary of the clinical efficacy and safety data on bevacizumab in patients with HGG, the practical issues surrounding the administration of bevacizumab, and ongoing investigations of bevacizumab in additional brain tumor treatment settings.", "journal": "Cancer", "date": "2010-06-22", "authors": ["Marc CChamberlain"], "doi": "10.1002/cncr.25256"}

Streptavidin alkaline phosphatase immunohistochemistry was performed with a mouse anti-human LRP1 and rabbit anti-human alpha(2)M antibodies. Retinal and choroidal blood vessels were labeled with mouse anti-human CD34 antibody in adjacent tissue sections. Mean scores for immunostaining from the pathological and control eyes were statistically compared. LRP1 immunoreactivity was very weak to negative in the neural retina of normal subjects except in scattered astrocytes. LRP1 expression in diabetic eyes was detected in the internal limiting membrane (ILM), astrocytes, inner photoreceptor matrix, choriocapillaris and choroidal stroma. The ligand alpha(2)M, however, was limited mainly to blood vessel walls, some areas of the inner nuclear layer (INL), photoreceptors, RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex, intercapillary septa, and choroidal stroma. In sickle cell eyes, avascular and vascular retina as well as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were analyzed. In avascular areas, LRP1 immunoreactivity was in innermost retina (presumably ILM, astrocytes, and Muller cells) and INL as well as RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex and choroidal stroma. alpha(2)M was very weak in avascular peripheral retina compared to vascularized areas and limited to stroma in choroid. In contrast, in areas with CNV, LRP1 immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in overlying retina and in RPE-Bruch's membrane and choroidal stroma compared to the controls, while alpha(2)M was elevated in RPE-Bruch's membrane near CNV compared to normal areas in sickle cell choroid. The mean scores revealed that LRP1 and alpha(2)M in neural retina were significantly elevated in astrocytes and ILM in diabetic eyes (p < or = 0.05), whereas in sickle cell eyes scores were elevated in ILM and INL (p < or = 0.05). In addition, alpha(2)M immunoreactivity was in photoreceptors in both ischemic retinopathies. In choroid, the patterns of LRP1 and alpha(2)M expression were different and not coincident. This is the first demonstration of the presence of LRP1 and alpha(2)M in human proliferative retinopathies.

Large and highly vascularized tumors were generated by cells over-expressing wt hPar1, Y397Z hPar1, with persistent signaling, or Y381A hPar1 mutant constructs. In contrast, cells over-expressing the truncated form of hPar1, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, developed small or no tumors, similar to cells expressing empty vector or control untreated cells. Antibody array membranes revealed essential hPar1 partners including Etk/Bmx and Shc. PAR(1) activation induces Etk/Bmx and Shc binding to the receptor C-tail to form a complex. Y/A mutations in the PAR(1) C-tail did not prevent Shc-PAR(1) association, but enhanced the number of liver metastases compared with the already increased metastases obtained with wt hPar1. We found that Etk/Bmx first binds via the PH domain to a region of seven residues, located between C378-S384 in PAR(1) C-tail, enabling subsequent Shc association. Importantly, expression of the hPar1-7A mutant form (substituted A, residues 378-384), which is incapable of binding Etk/Bmx, resulted in inhibition of invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Similarly, knocking down Etk/Bmx inhibited PAR(1)-induced MDA-MB-435 cell migration. In addition, intact spheroid morphogenesis of MCF10A cells is markedly disrupted by the ectopic expression of wt hPar1. In contrast, the forced expression of the hPar1-7A mutant results in normal ball-shaped spheroids. Thus, by preventing binding of Etk/Bmx to PAR(1) -C-tail, hPar1 oncogenic properties are abrogated.\nThis is the first demonstration that a cytoplasmic portion of the PAR(1) C-tail functions as a scaffold site.

{"title": "Three-dimensional morphometry of strained bovine periodontal ligament using synchrotron radiation-based tomography.", "abstract": "The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a highly vascularized soft connective tissue. Previous studies suggest that the viscous component of the mechanical response may be explained by the deformation-induced collapse and expansion of internal voids (i.e. chiefly blood vessels) interacting with liquids (i.e. blood and interstitial fluids) flowing through the pores. In the present work we propose a methodology by means of which the morphology of the PDL vascular plexus can be monitored at different levels of compressive and tensile strains. To this end, 4-mm-diameter cylindrical specimens, comprising layers of bone, PDL and dentin covered by cementum, were strained at stretch ratios ranging from lambda = 0.6 to lambda = 1.4 and scanned using synchrotron radiation-based computer tomography. It was concluded that: (1) the PDL vascular network is layered in two distinct planes of blood vessels (BVs): an inner layer (close to the tooth), in which the BVs run in apico-coronal direction, and an outer layer (close to the alveolar bone), in which the BVs distribution is more diffuse; (2) during tension and compression, the porosity tissue is kept fairly constant; (3) mechanical straining induces important changes in BV diameters, possibly modifying the permeability of the PDL and thus contributing to the viscous component of the viscoelastic response observed under compressive forces.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2010-06-19", "authors": ["MarzioBergomi", "Jo\u00eblCugnoni", "H W AnselmWiskott", "PhilippSchneider", "MarcoStampanoni", "JohnBotsis", "Urs CBelser"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01250.x"}

We examined the effect of pO(2) on formation of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, in 14-day cultures of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) on ivory discs. Hypoxia (1-2% O(2)) caused threefold increases in the number of osteoclasts formed, compared with 20% O(2). Hypoxia also caused a twofold increase in the number of nuclei per osteoclast, leading to stimulations of resorption pit formation of up to 10-fold. Exposure to hypoxia led to stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 expression by hPBMCs.

Thirty-two flaps were harvested and divided into the following combination groups: cutaneous-venoneuroadipofascial (n = 5), venoneuroadipofascial (n = 3), neurofascial (n = 4), cutaneous-adipovenous (n = 2), cutaneous-venoadipofascial (n = 9), venoadipofascial (n = 5), and purely fascial (n = 4). Leg length, location of the sural nerve crossing the deep fascia, and location of peroneal and posterior tibial artery perforators were recorded. Twenty-eight of the combination flaps were injected with barium sulfate. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography was used to analyze the vascular territory of each flap.\nThe cutaneous-venoneuroadipofascial and cutaneous-venoadipofascial flaps were perfused 86.5 percent and 80.2 percent, respectively, followed by cutaneous-adipovenous (75.7 percent), venoneuroadipofascial (87.1 percent), and venoadipofascial (74.8 percent) flaps. In contrast, the neurofascial and purely fascial flaps were merely perfused 40.8 percent and 44.1 percent, respectively, using only a perineural vascular network, with minimal fascial contribution.\nThe lesser saphenous vein and the deep adipose tissue are necessary for the arterial supply of the sural flap. The deep fascia serves only as mechanical support. The sural nerve contributes to the vascular network, but its inclusion does not increase the vascular territory.

{"title": "Self-assembling nanostructures to deliver angiogenic factors to pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "Supramolecular self-assembly of nanoscale filaments offers a vehicle to signal cells within dense cell aggregates such as pancreatic islets. We previously developed a heparin-binding peptide amphiphile (HBPA) that self-assembles into nanofiber gels at concentrations of 1% by weight when mixed with heparin and activates heparin-binding, angiogenic growth factors. We report here on the use of these molecules at concentrations 100 times lower to drive delivery of the nanofibers into the dense islet interior. Using fluorescent markers, HBPA molecules, heparin, and FGF2 were shown to be present in and on the surface of murine islets. The intraislet nanofibers were found to be necessary to retain FGF2 within the islet for 48 h and to increase cell viability significantly for at least 7 days in culture. Furthermore, enhanced insulin secretion was observed with the nanofibers for 3 days in culture.

{"title": "Magnetic resonance imaging of brain angiogenesis after stroke.", "abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. The initial changes in local perfusion and tissue status underlying loss of brain function are increasingly investigated with noninvasive imaging methods. In addition, there is a growing interest in imaging of processes that contribute to post-stroke recovery. In this review, we discuss the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the formation of new vessels by angiogenesis, which is hypothesized to participate in brain plasticity and functional recovery after stroke. The excellent soft tissue contrast, high spatial and temporal resolution, and versatility render MRI particularly suitable to monitor the dynamic processes involved in vascular remodeling after stroke. Here we review recent advances in the field of MR imaging that are aimed at assessment of tissue perfusion and microvascular characteristics, including cerebral blood flow and volume, vascular density, size and integrity. The potential of MRI to noninvasively monitor the evolution of post-ischemic angiogenic processes is demonstrated from a variety of in vivo studies in experimental stroke models. Finally, we discuss some pitfalls and limitations that may critically affect the accuracy and interpretation of MRI-based measures of (neo)vascularization after stroke.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2010-06-17", "authors": ["Peter RSeevinck", "Lisette HDeddens", "Rick MDijkhuizen"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-010-9174-0\n10.1002/ana.21393\n10.1002/ana.21412\n10.1056/NEJMoa0804656\n10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01562-9\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07176.x\n10.1007/s00401-009-0483-6\n10.1042/CS20060049\n10.2174/156720206776875902\n10.1016/S1050-1738(01)00149-9\n10.1161/01.STR.0000259636.26950.3b\n10.1038/jcbfm.2010.5\n10.1097/01.WCB.0000100341.78607.EB\n10.1097/00004647-199806000-00001\n10.1016/j.nbd.2008.08.005\n10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.025\n10.1016/j.brainres.2006.10.098\n10.1161/01.STR.0000037675.97888.9D\n10.1097/00004647-200110000-00011\n10.1148/radiol.2512080485\n10.1002/jmri.1073\n10.1097/00004647-199907000-00001\n10.1002/nbm.923\n10.1002/mrm.1910140211\n10.1002/mrm.1910060205\n10.1002/mrm.1252\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.06.063\n10.1002/mrm.1910230106\n10.1073/pnas.89.1.212\n10.1002/(SICI)1099-1492(199604)9:2<79::AID-NBM399>3.0.CO;2-4\n10.1002/mrm.1910400308\n10.1038/jcbfm.2008.33\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.502146\n10.1002/mrm.20383\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2586(199902)9:2<228::AID-JMRI12>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1097/00004424-200306000-00002\n10.1002/mrm.1910350207\n10.1002/mrm.1910340412\n10.1002/mrm.1910310103\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2594(199903)41:3<499::AID-MRM12>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1002/mrm.1910320610\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.022\n10.1002/mrm.10660\n10.1002/1522-2594(200103)45:3<397::AID-MRM1052>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1002/nbm.1278\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.86\n10.1002/mrm.1910400602\n10.1002/mrm.20017\n10.1002/1522-2594(200008)44:2<224::AID-MRM9>3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1002/nbm.921\n10.1038/jcbfm.2008.85\n10.1038/jcbfm.2008.42\n10.1002/mrm.1910170208\n10.1073/pnas.87.24.9868\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2586(199909)10:3<223::AID-JMRI2>3.0.CO;2-S\n10.1016/S0022-510X(99)00121-5\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600288\n10.1002/mrm.10524\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600053\n10.1016/S0006-8993(96)00815-3\n10.1002/nbm.1940070104\n10.1002/mrm.20198\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.491621\n10.1002/mrm.1910360510\n10.1002/mrm.1910360511\n10.1002/mrm.10610\n10.1038/nm0598-623\n10.1096/fj.07-103929\n10.1002/nbm.1134\n10.1593/neo.04436\n10.1038/nm1208\n10.1097/00001756-200306110-00014\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.218\n10.1006/nimg.1997.0288"}

Expression of osteogenic markers including osteogenic protein-1, bone morphogenetic protein-3 and type IV collagen mRNAs from generated specimens was examined by Northern blot analysis.\nHeterotopic intramuscular implantation of 5 and 25 microg hTGF-beta(2) combined with 100 mg of insoluble collagenous bone matrix yielded large corticalized mineralized ossicles by day 30 with remodelling and induction of haematopoietic marrow by day 90. Addition of morcellized rectus abdominis muscle to calvarial implants enhanced induction of bone formation significantly by day 90.\nIn Papio ursinus, in marked contrast to rodents and lagomorphs, hTGF-beta(2) induced large corticalized and vascularized ossicles by day 30 after implantation into the rectus abdominis muscle. This striated muscle contains responding stem cells that enhance the bone induction cascade of hTGF-beta(2). Induction of bone formation by hTGF-beta(2) in the non-human primate Papio ursinus may occur as a result of expression of bone morphogenetic proteins on heterotopic implantation of hTGF-beta(2); the bone induction cascade initiated by mammalian TGF-beta proteins in Papio ursinus needs to be re-evaluated for novel molecular therapeutics for induction of bone formation in clinical contexts.", "journal": "Cell proliferation", "date": "2010-06-16", "authors": ["URipamonti", "L CRoden"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2184.2010.00675.x"}
{"title": "Detection of hypoxia inducible factors and angiogenic growth factors during foetal endochondral and intramembranous ossification.", "abstract": "During skeletogenesis, the development of a new vascular network, i.e. angiogenesis, is triggered by hypoxia through the activation of the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. HIFs regulate the expression of several genes, including those coding for angiogenic growth factors such as VEGFA, angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2). The expression of HIFs and angiogenic growth factors is well documented in endochondral ossification, but few data exist on their expression during intramembranous ossification. In this study, the localization of these factors was examined using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR in bones of porcine foetuses. Immunostaining for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha was observed during endochondral ossification, whereas only HIF-2alpha was present at sites of intramembranous ossification. Furthermore, immunostaining for ANGPT2 was present at sites of endochondral and intramembranous ossification. In addition, gene transcripts for ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and VEGFA were detected with RT-PCR in laser capture microdissected isolates from both types of ossification. These results indicate that angiogenesis plays an important role during endochondral and intramembranous ossification. However, the different expression pattern of the HIF-alpha subunits suggests that alternative regulatory pathways trigger angiogenesis in these distinct types of ossification.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2010-06-16", "authors": ["WDe Spiegelaere", "PCornillie", "CCasteleyn", "CBurvenich", "WVan den Broeck"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0264.2010.01005.x"}

The retina is an excellent model in which to study the role of cell type-specific contributions to the process of blood vessel and neuronal growth. During retinal vascular development, glial cells such as astrocytes provide the template over which endothelial cells migrate to form the retinal vascular network, and hypoxia-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in this process as well as pathological neovascularization. To investigate the nature of cell-specific contributions to this process, we deleted VEGF and its upstream regulators, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha, and the negative regulator of HIF alpha, von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), in astrocytes. We found that loss of hypoxic response and VEGF production in astrocytes does not impair normal development of retinal vasculature, indicating that astrocyte-derived VEGF is not essential for this process. In contrast, using a model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy, we show that astrocyte-derived VEGF is essential for hypoxia-induced neovascularization. Thus, we demonstrate that astrocytes in the retina have highly divergent roles during developmental, physiological angiogenesis, and ischemia-driven, pathological neovascularization.", "journal": "Glia", "date": "2010-06-15", "authors": ["AlexanderWeidemann", "Tim UKrohne", "EdithAguilar", "ToshihideKurihara", "NorihikoTakeda", "Michael IDorrell", "M CelesteSimon", "Volker HHaase", "MartinFriedlander", "Randall SJohnson"], "doi": "10.1002/glia.20997"}

The out-flux of NO from a tumor to air or blood scales with the contacting area and with the concentration gradient; the gradient scales with the tumor-air or tumor-blood concentration difference and scales inversely with the thickness of the boundary layer, i.e. the fluid's flow rate. Air-contacting skin and lung cancers account for approximately 60% of all cancers in part because out-diffusion of NO from nascent tumors to air increases the likelihood of their survival. Out-diffusion of NO also explains their initially 2-D spreading at the air interface. Blood is an NO sink because its proteins are rapidly S-nitrosated; depletion of NO by the blood explains the dormancy of tumors until their vascularization and their virulence after vascularization. Erythrocytes store NO(2)- and their carbonic anhydrase converts it to NO and NO(3)(-). Thus, NaNO(2), a common additive in cured meats, may reduce NO out-diffusion by raising the blood NO concentration.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2010-06-15", "authors": ["AdamHeller"], "doi": "10.1039/c004520a"}
{"title": "Update on limbal stem cell transplantation.", "abstract": "Limbal epithelial stem cells are the primary source of corneal epithelial cell regeneration. Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) can develop in traumatic, immunologic, or genetic diseases that affect the ocular surface. LSCD leads to conjunctivalization, with corneal vascularization and opacification and subsequent loss of vision. Limbal stem cell transplantation is a surgical treatment to address LSCD and restore a corneal epithelial phenotype. Based on the source of cells, limbal transplant can be autologous or allogenic. Many surgical techniques are defined according to the source of the stem cells and the carrier tissues that are used. More recently, ex vivo expanded bioengineered epithelial cells have been used to reconstruct the corneal surface using autologous cells to eliminate the risk of rejection. Before transplantation, a systematic exam of the lids, eyelashes, fornices, and aqueous tears is mandatory and every effort should be made to optimize ocular surface health and control inflammation to enhance the chances of graft survival. Postoperative care is also another major determinant of success. Any factor that destabilizes the ocular surface needs to be addressed. In addition, systemic and topical immunosuppressants are also needed in all allograft recipients. In addition to pre-operative and postoperative care and the surgery itself, the etiology of LSCD also has an impact on the outcome.

By using a model of transplantation tolerance mediated by CD8(+) Tregs following CD40Ig treatment in rats, in this study, we show that the accumulation of tolerogenic CD8(+) Tregs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in allograft and spleen but not lymph nodes was associated with tolerance induction in vascularized allograft recipients. pDCs preferentially induced tolerogenic CD8(+) Tregs to suppress CD4(+) effector cells responses to first-donor Ags in vitro. When tolerogenic CD8(+) Tregs were not in contact with CD4(+) effector cells, suppression was mediated by IDO. Contact with CD4(+) effector cells resulted in alternative suppressive mechanisms implicating IFN-gamma and fibroleukin-2. In vivo, both IDO and IFN-gamma were involved in tolerance induction, suggesting that contact with CD4(+) effector cells is crucial to modulate CD8(+) Tregs function in vivo.

Characteristic pattern of juxtaepithelial loss of CD34 positive stromal cells and its role in malignant transformation in OSF deserves further attention.", "journal": "Oral oncology", "date": "2010-06-12", "authors": ["Rajiv SDesai", "G SMamatha", "Musarrat JKhatri", "Subraj JShetty"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.04.004"}

The efficacy of a new protocol that uses total body irradiation (TBI), granulocyte colony-stimulation factor (G-CSF), and FK506 to induce high level bone marrow chimerism was evaluated with particular reference to the dose requirement and toxicity of TBI.\nIn total, 82 whole-limb allotransplants from LacZ transgenic rats to LEW rats were performed. TBI was administered just prior to transplantation with various doses ranging from 100 to 1500 R (almost equal to 1-15 Gy). G-CSF was given for 4 d, while FK506 was used for 28 d. The level of chimerism was evaluated by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nThe survival of limb allografts in recipients that were pretreated with a myeloablative TBI dose of >1000 R was prolonged to more than 1 y. Recipients pretreated with <500 R showed no prolongation of limb graft survival. A majority of long-term survivors showed chronic, nonlethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). PCR analysis revealed a high level of intra-bone marrow chimerism in the recipient, thus demonstrating successful induction of macrochimerism.\nVascularized limb/bone marrow graft is a proven method for supplying donor cells to the bone marrow of irradiated recipients. A new protocol involving pretransplant myeloablative TBI with >1000 R followed by treatment with G-CSF and FK506 was found to induce a high level of chimerism and significantly prolong the survival of limb allografts without causing lethal GVHD.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2010-06-12", "authors": ["KeiichiMuramatsu", "HidetoyoKato", "YuichiroYoshida", "AtsushiMoriya", "TomoakiOkimoto", "ToshihikoTaguchi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2010.03.042"}

Controlled initiation of this mechanism for therapeutic/engineered angiogenesis must rely on precisely localized hypoxia. Here we have designed a 3D in vitro model able to test the effect and predictability of spatially positioned local hypoxic stimuli using defined cell depots within a 3D collagen matrix. Cell-mediated hypoxia was engineered using human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), to generate a local population of Hypoxia-Induced Signaling (HIS) cells. HIS cell depots released angiogenic factors which induced directional endothelial cell (EC) migration and tubule formation in a spatially defined assay system. Non-hypoxic baseline control cultures induced minimal EC migration with little tubule formation. Furthermore, depots of HIS cells, positioned in the core of 3D collagen constructs directed host vessel in-growth deep into the implant by 1 week, which was at least 7 days earlier than in non-hypoxia pre-conditioned constructs. The functionality of in vivo vascularisation was verified by real-time monitoring of O2 levels in the core of implanted constructs.

In vitro, treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with albendazole led to inhibition of tube formation, migration, permeability and down-regulation of the VEGF type 2 receptor (VEGFR-2).

These distant cells get less oxygen and nutrients and are exposed to lower doses of chemotherapeutic agents. As gap junctions allow the passage of small molecules between cells, we tested the possibility that the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine can diffuse through gap junctions in solid tumors.\nWe first showed with a dye transfer assay that the glioblastoma and the osteosarcoma cells used in this study have functional gap junctions. These cells were genetically engineered to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK), and induced a \"bystander effect\" as demonstrated by the killing of TK-negative cells in presence of the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir (GCV). The ability of gemcitabine to induce a similar bystander effect was then tested by mixing cells treated with 3 microM gemcitabine for 24 hours with untreated cells at different ratios. In all cell lines tested, bystander cells were killed with ratios containing as low as 5% treated cells, and this toxic effect was reduced in presence of alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), a specific gap junction inhibitor. We also showed that a 2- or a 24-hour gemcitabine treatment was more efficient to inhibit the growth of spheroids with functional gap junctions as compared to the same treatment made in presence of AGA. Finally, after a 24-hour gemcitabine treatment, the cell viability in spheroids was reduced by 92% as opposed to 51% in presence of AGA.\nThese results indicate that gemcitabine-mediated toxicity can diffuse through gap junctions, and they suggest that gemcitabine treatment could be more efficient for treating solid tumors that display gap junctions.

Inflammatory cytokines can induce neovascularization in different organs, including the kidneys. However, whether obesity triggers renal neovascularization and, if so, its effect on renal function has never been investigated.\nBlood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured in vivo. Renal microvascular (MV) architecture was studied by 3D micro-CT in lean and obese Zucker rats (LZR and OZR, n = 7/group) at 12, 22, and 32 weeks of age. Renal inflammation was assessed by quantifying interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and ED-1 expression, as renal fibrosis in trichrome-stained cross-sections.\nMild inflammation and lower GFR was only observed in younger OZR, without renal fibrosis or changes in MV density. Interestingly, renal MV density increased in OZR at 32 weeks of age, accompanied by pronounced increase in renal IL-6 and TNF-alpha, ED-1+ cells, proteinuria, decreased GFR, and fibrosis.\nThis study shows increased renal cortical vascularization in experimental obesity, suggesting neovascularization as an evolving process as obesity progresses.

{"title": "Portal vein arterialization for hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplantation: a case report, Doppler-ultrasound aspects, and review of the literature.", "abstract": "Portal vein arterialization (PVA) is a salvage procedure for insufficient hepatic arterial or portal vascularization. It plays a role in auxiliary and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In OLT, current indications for PVA include hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), pre-OLT or post-OLT extended splanchnic vein thrombosis, intraoperative low portal flow, and anatomic variations like the absence of portal and mesenteric veins. Out of the transplantation domain, PVA is used both in extensive surgery for malignancies of the liver, biliary tract, and pancreas and in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to intoxications. We describe a case of acute post-OLT HAT successfully treated with PVA as a short bridge to retransplantation. By Doppler ultrasound of clinical PVA we detected an increased intrahepatic portal flow velocity, with disappearance of the arterial spikes, a finding that needs further investigation. PVA represents a rare surgical procedure. In fact, it has been used most of all in urgent conditions or in case of abrupt vascular complications during surgery. According to the literature, PVA emerges as a salvage procedure for poor arterial or portal hepatic flow, both in OLT and in general abdominal surgery. The outcome of this procedure is unpredictable. The aim of the shunt is to gain time, awaiting the onset of collateral arterial vessels or the performance of definitive surgery. Its early thrombosis may be a catastrophic event, due to acute liver ischemia. In contrast, a late occlusion is often well tolerated. Strict surveillance is always useful because sometimes it is mandatory to embolize the arterioportal fistula to treat or to prevent the onset of portal hypertension.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2010-06-11", "authors": ["UMaggi", "SCamagni", "PReggiani", "RLauro", "CSposito", "EMelada", "GRossi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.03.087"}

Here, we show that circulating human TEMs are already preprogrammed in the circulation to be more angiogenic and express higher levels of such proangiogenic genes as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), VEGFA, COX-2, and WNT5A than TIE2(-) monocytes. Additionally, angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) markedly enhanced the proangiogenic activity of TEMs and increased their expression of two proangiogenic enzymes: thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and cathepsin B (CTSB). Three \"alternatively activated\" (or M2-like) macrophage markers were also upregulated by ANG-2 in TEMs: interleukin-10, mannose receptor (MRC1), and CCL17. To investigate the effects of ANG-2 on the phenotype and function of TEMs in tumors, we used a double-transgenic (DT) mouse model in which ANG-2 was specifically overexpressed by endothelial cells. Syngeneic tumors grown in these ANG-2 DT mice were more vascularized and contained greater numbers of TEMs than those in wild-type (WT) mice. In both tumor types, expression of MMP-9 and MRC1 was mainly restricted to tumor TEMs rather than TIE2(-) macrophages. Furthermore, tumor TEMs expressed higher levels of MRC1, TP, and CTSB in ANG-2 DT tumors than WT tumors. Taken together, our data show that although circulating TEMs are innately proangiogenic, exposure to tumor-derived ANG-2 stimulates these cells to exhibit a broader, tumor-promoting phenotype.

After transplantation in athymic mice, an early inosculation between the graft and host vasculatures occurred within 4 days. We also concurrently detected an active invasion of the dermis by host capillaries sprouting from the wound bed. Thus, the microvascular network constructed in vitro within our three-dimensional skin substitute did not only develop functional anastomoses with the host's blood vessels but also promoted a rapid, complete, and optimal vascularization of the implanted tissues by exerting an angiogenic effect compared with control RS.

Human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were seeded in alginate. Poly(ethylene)glycol-diacrylate (PEGDA) was photopolymerized into 40-mm-diameter dome-shaped gel. Alginate-ASC suspension was painted onto PEGDA surface. Cultivation of hybrid constructs ex vivo in adipogenic medium for 28 days showed no delamination. Upon 4-week in vivo implantation in athymic rats, hybrid implants well integrated with host subcutaneous tissue and could only be surgically separated. Vascularized adipose tissue regenerated in the thin, painted alginate layer only if ASC-derived adipogenic cells were delivered. Contrastingly, abundant fibrous tissue filled ASC-free alginate layer encapsulating the acellular PEGDA core in control implants. Human-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) was detected in human ASC-seeded implants. Interestingly, rat-specific PPAR-\u03b3 was absent in either human ASC-seeded or ASC-free implants.

Remarkably, rat-specific platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) was detected in both ASC-seeded and ASC-free implants, suggesting anastomosis of vasculature in bioengineered tissue with host blood vessels.

Oxygen and nutrient transport were enhanced by developing a bioreactor system for perfusing hMSC-seeded collagen gels using porous silk tubes, resulting in enhanced oxygen transport and cell viability within the gels. These systems are simple to use and scaled for versatility, to allow for the systematic study of relationships between cell content, oxygen, and cell function. The data may be combined with oxygen transport modeling to derive minimally sized modular units for construction of clinically relevant tissue-engineered constructs, a generic strategy that may be employed for vascularized target tissues.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "VEGF and its role in the early development of the long bone epiphysis.", "abstract": "In long bones of murine species, undisturbed development of the epiphysis depends on the generation of vascularized cartilage canals shortly after birth. Despite its importance, it is still under discussion how this event is exactly regulated. It was suggested previously that, following increased hypoxia in the epiphyseal core, angiogenic factors are expressed and hence stimulate the ingrowth of the vascularized canals. In the present study, we tested this model and examined the spatio-temporal distribution of two angiogenic molecules during early development in mice. In addition, we investigated the onset of cartilage hypertrophy and mineralization. Our results provide evidence that the vascular endothelial growth factor is expressed in the epiphyseal resting cartilage prior to the moment of canal formation and is continuously expressed until the establishment of a large secondary ossification centre. Interestingly, we found no expression of secretoneurin before the establishment of the canals although this factor attracts blood vessels under hypoxic conditions. Epiphyseal development further involves maturation of the resting chondrocytes into hypertrophic ones, associated with the mineralization of the cartilage matrix and eventual death of the latter cells. Our results suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor is the critical molecule for the generation of the epiphyseal vascular network in mice long bones. Secretoneurin, however, does not appear to be a player in this event.

The presence of an extensive vascular network inside the tissue suggests a significant contribution of the fluid phase to the mechanical response. This study examined the load response of bovine PDL under different pore pressure levels. A custom-made pressure chamber was constructed. Rod-shaped specimens comprising portions of dentine, bone, and intervening layer of PDL were extracted from bovine mandibular molars. The dentine ends of the specimens were secured to the actuator while the bone ends were affixed to the load cell. The entire assemblage was surrounded by the pressure chamber, which was then filled with saline. Specimens loaded at 1.0 Hz sinusoidal displacement were subjected to four different environmental fluid pressures (i.e., pressures of 0.0-1.0 MPa). The video images recorded during the tests were analyzed to determine whether or not fluid exchange between the PDL and the surrounding medium took place during mechanical loading. A value for the tissue's apparent Poisson ratio was also determined. The following observations were made: (1) fluid was squeezed out and pumped into the ligament during the compressive and tensile loading phases, (2) the PDL was highly compressible, and (3) the pore pressure had no influence on the mechanical response of the PDL.

To explore the model's clinical relevance we interrogated phenotype-specific expression patterns in human melanoma patient material. A matched primary/metastasis pair from a human melanoma patient was obtained and immunohistochemically stained for proliferative and invasive phenotype markers.

Strikingly, we observed that late phase metastatic melanoma cells adopt morphologies and behaviours identical to very early phase cells.

Bone marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) have the potential to differentiate, at the single cell level, toward the three embryonic germ layers and may be the progenitors of the other tissue-specific stem cells. However, molecular mechanisms of endothelial differentiation from MAPC have not been defined. The importance of epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation in gene regulatory networks during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation has been documented. We postulated that endothelial cell (EC) differentiation from MAPC could be enhanced by inhibiting DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, reversing the repression of genes that specify EC fate.\nMAPCs were derived from rat bone marrow and differentiated into EC by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in the presence or absence of the specific DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Expression of the endothelial marker genes was assessed by real time quantitative PCR and angiogenic potential of the differentiated EC was assessed by analysis of vascular network formation on fibronectin.\nBoth aza-dC and TSA induced at least a three-fold increase in the expression of the EC marker genes VE-cadherin, vWF, and Flk1. This increase was also observed in the presence of the EC differentiation inducer VEGF, suggesting that factors other than VEGF mediate the response to the epigenetic agents.

Tumor hypoxia and high HIF protein levels are frequently associated with aggressive disease.

Neuroblastoma tumor initiating cells are immature with a neural crest-like phenotype and downregulation of HIF-2\u03b1 in these cells results in neuronal sympathetic differentiation and the cells become phenotypically similar to the bulk of neuroblastoma cells found in clinical specimens.

Unlike previous assays, this new assay assesses the effects of drugs on the ability of tissues to attract and develop their own blood supply. The CAM already has a well-developed vascular network that is capable of providing blood vessels to the non-vascularized FB, allowing for this tissue to develop feathers. As a result, the exposure of the FB to drugs for 2 days followed by attachment to the CAM for 4 days allows evaluation of the compound's ability to impact blood vessel and feather formation within the CAM-attached FB tissue.

We examined the radiographic result after a minimum of 4 years with special reference to the development of osteoarthritis and its relation to clinical symptoms in eight patients, mean age 49 (25-66) years. After a mean of 60 (48-69) months, the arc of motion was 67\u00b0 (45\u00b0-95\u00b0) at the PIP joint and grip strength was 91% of the uninjured side. The visual analogue score for pain (0-100) was 10 (0-70) mm. Severe arthritis (grade IV) was found in two and mild arthritis (grade II) in another two patients, but only one of these four cases had troublesome pain. The hemi-hamate technique is an attractive alternative to other treatment options, but some cases develop osteoarthritis in the medium term.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery, European volume", "date": "2010-06-01", "authors": ["GAfendras", "AAbramo", "AMrkonjic", "MGeijer", "PKopylov", "MT\u00e4gil"], "doi": "10.1177/1753193410373311"}
{"title": "Iodinated blood pool contrast media for preclinical X-ray imaging applications--a review.", "abstract": "The in vivo X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a very powerful and non-invasive tool used to establish high-resolution images with isotropic voxels in typical scan times ranging from minutes to tenths of minutes. This preclinical imaging technology is primarily adapted to visualize bones. X-ray imaging of soft tissues is made possible by using opaque compounds, providing contrast through tissue vascularization. Thus, using control agents with a long-lasting time in the blood, active or passive targeting of soft tissue is made possible in small animals. In this respect, the use of hydrophilic iodinated X-ray contrast media remains limited due to their rapid blood clearance, albeit at a slightly slower pace in humans as compared with rodents. The development of an iodinated contrast medium with increased vascular residence time is thus necessary. This is precisely the scope of the present paper, which will review and compare in detail the different vectors used as long-circulating iodinated contrast agents for micro-CT, i.e. liposomes, nanoemulsions, micelles, dendrimers and other polymeric particles. The discussion is focused, for each of these nanoparticulate systems, on their method of formulation and production, their stability properties, encapsulation properties, release properties, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. The different aspects relative to the adaptation of these properties and physico-chemical characteristics for blood pool contrast agents aimed at angiographic micro-CT applications are also discussed. The aim of this review is to propose an overview into the formulation and properties of iodinated micro-CT contrast agents for preclinical applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-06-01", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7oisHallouard", "NicolasAnton", "PhilippeChoquet", "Andr\u00e9Constantinesco", "ThierryVandamme"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.066"}
{"title": "Sympathetic Neurotransmitters and Tumor Angiogenesis-Link between Stress and Cancer Progression.", "abstract": "Recent evidence supports a longstanding hypothesis that chronic stress can influence tumor growth and progression. It has been shown that sympathetic neurotransmitters, such as catecholamines and neuropeptides, can affect both cancer cell growth and tumor vascularization. Depending on neurotransmitter and type of tumor, these effects can be both stimulatory and inhibitory. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) are potent stimulators of vascularization, acting both by inducing the release of angiogenic factors from tumor cells and directly on endothelial cell (EC) functions. As a result, activation of the adrenergic system increases growth of various types of tumors and has been shown to mediate stress-induced augmentation of tumor progression. Dopamine (DA), on the other hand, interferes with VEGF signaling in endothelial cells, blocks its angiogenic functions and inhibits tumor growth. Another sympathetic neurotransmitter coreleased with NE, neuropeptide Y (NPY), directly stimulates angiogenesis. However, proangiogenic actions of NPY can be altered by its direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and survival. In consequence, NPY can either stimulate or inhibit tumor growth, depending on tumor type. Hence, sympathetic neurotransmitters are powerful modulators of tumor growth and can become new targets in cancer therapy.", "journal": "Journal of oncology", "date": "2010-05-29", "authors": ["JasonTilan", "JoannaKitlinska"], "doi": "10.1155/2010/539706"}

This has been documented for solid tumors, and there is an emerging evidence suggesting that tumor progression of hematolymphoid malignancies also depends on the induction of new blood vessel formation. The most important proangiogenic agent is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), activating VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The available data on angiogenesis in hemato-lymphoid malignancies, such as acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas, point towards the significance of autocrine and paracrine VEGF-mediated effects for proliferation and survival of leukemia/lymphoma cells in addition to tumor vascularization. Antiangiogenic strategies have become an important therapeutic modality for solid tumors. Several antiangiogenic agents targeting VEGF-related pathways are also being utilized in clinical trials for the treatment of hemato-lymphoid malignancies, and in some instances these pathways have emerged as promising therapeutic targets.

New developments in this area will be investigated by reviewing the most recent literature on this topic as compared with other techniques currently employed. With the advances of vascularized free flap reconstruction it is important to investigate the indication for nonvascularized techniques.\nReplacement of a portion of the mandibular bone is a common procedure for patients undergoing ablative cancer surgery or for infection as well as temporomandibular joint replacement secondary to disease or trauma. The subject of mandibular reconstruction has seen great advances in recent years with the advent of vascularized free tissue transfer. Other newer areas of mandibular replacement include tissue engineering and distraction osteogenesis. Traditional nonvascularized autogenous bone graft replacement can still play a vital role in rehabilitating these patients.\nAlthough vascularized free flap reconstruction of mandibular defects has become the more common method of treating the postablative cancer surgery patient, there remain indications for nonvascularized reconstruction of mandibular defects as well as other techniques.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2010-05-29", "authors": ["ArchieMorrison", "JamesBrady"], "doi": "10.1097/MOO.0b013e32833a46ed"}

Here we report that the transforming growth factor, TGFbeta2 is involved in RA-regulated cardiovascular development. In VAD embryos TGFbeta2 mRNA and protein expression are greatly elevated. The expression of TGFbeta receptor II is also elevated in VAD embryos but is normalized by treatment with TGFbeta2-specific antisense oligonucleotides (AS). Administration of this AS or an antibody specific for TGFbeta2 to VAD embryos normalizes posterior heart development and vascularization, while the administration of exogenous active TGFbeta2 protein to normal quail embryos mimics the excessive TGFbeta2 status of VAD embryos and induces VAD cardiovascular phenotype. In VAD embryos pSmad2/3 and pErk1 are not activated, while pErk2 and pcRaf are elevated and pSmad1/5/8 is diminished. We conclude that in the early avian embryo TGFbeta2 has a major role in the retinoic acid-regulated posterior heart morphogenesis for which it does not use Smad2/3 pathways, but may use other signaling pathways.

A large variety of reconstructive techniques for the plantar aspect of the foot have been described previously, including skin grafts, local flaps, fasciocutaneous flaps, perforator flaps, cross-limb flaps, and free flaps. This article presents a case of a 64-year-old patient with insulin-dependent diabetes who was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in a large plantar tissue defect (9x4 cm) extending to the base of the toes. After debridement of the wound, a subcutaneous flap was raised from the medial aspect of the lower leg in a sovrafascial plane. The flap was based on a double vascularization given by the great saphenous vein and by the perforator vessels from the posterior tibial artery, located anteriorly and inferiorly to the medial malleolus. The flap showed excellent vitality and long-term result with reduced donor site morbidity. We believe this flap represents a reliable surgical option in superficial plantar defects due to easy harvesting, short operative time, and minimal donor site morbidity. The subcutaneous flap of the distal medial fourth of the leg is a safe technique because of the vascular components of the pedicle.

We introduced human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (hBOEC) in a self-assembled human dermal fibroblast sheet (hDFS), intended as a tissue-engineered dermal substitute with inherent vascular potential. hBOEC were functionally and molecularly different from early endothelial progenitor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). hBOEC alone, unlike HUVEC, efficiently revascularized and re-oxygenated the wound bed, both by active incorporation into new vessels and by trophic stimulation of host angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, hBOEC alone, but not HUVEC, accelerated epithelial coverage and matrix organization of the wound bed. In addition, integration of hBOEC in hDFS not only further improved vascularization, epithelial coverage and matrix organization but also prevented excessive wound contraction. In vitro analyses with hBOEC, fibroblasts and keratinocytes revealed that these effects were both due to growth factor crosstalk and to short cutting hypoxia. Among multiple growth factors secreted by hBOEC, placental growth factor mediated at least in part the beneficial effects on keratinocyte migration and proliferation.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to re-endothelialization and neo-vascularization, and the increase of EPCs in peripherial circulation benefits the prognosis of cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the biological stimuli that initiate the proliferation and the maintenance of stem cell phenotype of EPCs. Here we reported that human umbilical vein blood derived EPCs expressed gene transcripts coding for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1-6, TLR8-10, TLR4 co-receptor CD14, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a TLR adaptor molecule. Protein expression of TLR2, 4, CD14, and MyD88 was also detected by FACS or Western blot. The activation of TLR4 by LPS modulated the expression of TLRs, induced the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, P38, and ERK42/44, and up-regulated the gene expression of cytokines IL-8, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and TNF-alpha, suggesting EPCs expressed functional TLR4. Unexpectedly LPS treatment failed to induce apoptosis in EPCs, but instead promoted cell proliferation of EPCs. Furthermore, the treatment of EPCs with LPS up-regulated stem cell markers AC133 and CD34 in both mRNA and protein levels, and down-regulated the protein expression of differential marker eNOS. These results suggested that TLR4 functions to maintain the stem cell phenotype of EPCs and enlarge its population, which reveals a novel aspect of the multiple-faced TLR biology, and may open new prospects for using TLR4 agonists to promote the production of EPCs for clinical use.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2010-05-28", "authors": ["JinHe", "ZhilinXiao", "XiaobinChen", "MeifangChen", "LiFang", "MeiYang", "QingshanLv", "YuehuiLi", "GuanchengLi", "JinyueHu", "XiumeiXie"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.22686"}

Here, we found that AE diminished the formation of novel reparative lipid mediator 14S,21-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid (14S,21-diHDHA) and its biosynthetic intermediate 14S-hydroxy-DHA (14S-HDHA) from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in murine wounds. However, AE did not reduce the formation of DHA and the intermediate 21-HDHA. These results indicate that in the biosynthetic pathways of 14S,21-diHDHA in wounds, AE suppresses the 14S-hydroxy-generating activity of 12-lipoxygenase-like (LOX-like), but does not suppress the 21-hydroxy-generating activity of cytochrome P450 and DHA-generating activities. The AE-suppression of 12-LOX-like activity was further confirmed by the diminished formation of 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid in wounds under AE. Supplementing 14S,21-diHDHA to wounds rescued the AE-impaired healing and vascularization. 14S,21-diHDHA restored AE-impaired processes of angiogenesis in vitro: endothelial cell migration, tubulogenesis, and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Taken together, the suppression of 14S,21-diHDHA formation is responsible, at least partially, for the AE-impairment of cutaneous wound healing and angiogenesis. Supplementing 14S,21-diHDHA to compensate its deficit in AE-impaired wounds rescues the healing and angiogenesis. These results provide a novel mechanistic insight for AE-impaired wound healing that involves the necessary roles of 14S,21-diHDHA.

This study was undertaken to examine whether overexpression of the relevant molecules could inhibit angiogenesis of normal microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), and whether silencing of these molecules in SSc MVECs could restore the lost angiogenic properties of the cells in vitro and in vivo.\nTransient transfection of MVECs with human MMP12 and PTX3 was performed by electroporation. Silencing of MMP12 and PTX3 was obtained by treatment with small interfering RNA, and treatment effects were validated by Western blotting with specific antibodies and a fluorimetric assay. In vitro cell migration and capillary morphogenesis were studied on Matrigel substrates. In vivo angiogenesis was studied using a Matrigel sponge assay in mice.\nTransfection of MMP12 and PTX3 in normal MVECs resulted in loss of proliferation, invasion, and capillary morphogenesis in vitro, attributed to truncation of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor by MMP12 and to the anti-fibroblast growth factor 2/anti-vascular endothelial growth factor activity of PTX3. These effects were particularly evident in mixed populations of transfected normal MVECs (50% transfected with MMP12 and 50% with PTX3). Silencing of the same molecules in SSc MVECs increased their invasion in Matrigel. Single-gene silencing did not increase the capillary morphogenesis of SSc MVECs, whereas double-gene-silenced cells showed a burst of capillary tube formation. Culture medium of silenced SSc MVECs stimulated angiogenesis in assays of Matrigel sponge invasion in mice.\nOverexpression of either MMP12 or PTX3 in normal MVECs blunts their angiogenic properties.

Fibroblasts (FBs) are responsible for expression of angiogenic growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as collagen deposition and fibrotic myocardial remodeling. Recently, self-assembling peptide nanofibers were described as a promising environment for cardiac regeneration due to its synthetic nature and control over physiochemical properties. In this study, peptide nanofibers were used as a model system to quantify the dual role of fibroblasts in mediating angiogenesis chemically via expression of angiogenic factors and mechanically via cell-mediated scaffold disruption, extracellular matrix deposition, and remodeling. Human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), FBs, or cocultures were cultured in three-dimensional nanofibers for up to 6 days. The peptide nanofiber microenvironment supported cell migration, capillary network formation, and cell survival in the absence of detectable scaffold contraction and proteolytic degradation. FBs enhanced early capillary network formation by \"assisting\" EC migration and increasing vascular endothelial growth factor and Angiopoietin-1 expression in a temporal manner. EC-FB interactions attenuated FB matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression while increasing collagen I deposition, resulting in greater construct stiffness and a more stable microenvironment in cocultures. Whereas FBs are critical for initial steps of angiogenesis in the absence of external angiogenic stimulation, coordinated efforts by ECs and FBs are required for a balance between cell-mediated scaffold disruption, extracellular matrix deposition, and remodeling at later time points.

P53 responsiveness of the angiogenesis-related target genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), and collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase alpha 2 (P4HA2), was evaluated by (i) overexpression of wild-type p53 in homozygously TP53-deleted LN-308 cells; (ii) shRNA-mediated p53 knockdown in the TP53 wild-type LNT-229 cells; and (iii) chemical induction of wild-type p53 expression in LNT-229 cells by camptothecin. Irrespective of the TP53 status, vascularization did not differ significantly between the two groups of glioblastoma specimens. Of all target genes, only P4HA2 mRNA was upregulated through wild-type p53. As opposed to several nonglial tumors, in glioblastoma cells, p53-mediated transcriptional induction of P4HA2 mRNA neither resulted in increased levels of P4HA2 protein or antiangiogenic endostatin nor did it influence endothelial cell sprouting, viability, or transmigration in vitro. Moreover, p53-uncoupled stable overexpression of P4HA2 in LN-308 cells did not affect endothelial cell viability.

{"title": "Etiology, clinical manifestations, and prediction of placental abruption.", "abstract": "Placental abruption, defined as complete or partial detachment of the placenta before delivery, is one of the most devastating pregnancy complications. Bleeding and pain consist the classical symptoms of placental abruption but the clinical picture varies from asymptomatic, in which the diagnosis is made by inspection of the placenta at delivery, to massive abruption leading to fetal death and severe maternal morbidity. The diagnosis is always clinical. The etiology of placental abruption is not fully understood but impaired placentation, placental insufficiency, intrauterine hypoxia, and uteroplacental underperfusion are likely the key mechanisms causing abruption. Abruption results from a rupture of maternal decidual artery causing dissection of the decidual-placental interface. Acute vasospasm of small vessels may precede abruption. The trophoplastic invasion in the spiral arteries and subsequent early vascularization may be defective. Moreover, placental abruption may also be a manifestation of an inflammatory process which could affect vascular bed. Despite heightened awareness, placental abruption still remains unpredictable and unpreventable. A clinically useful predictive test is needed to detect individuals at risk.

{"title": "A modular approach to cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Functional cardiac tissue was prepared using a modular tissue engineering approach with the goal of creating vascularized tissue. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) were seeded onto submillimeter-sized modules made of type I bovine collagen supplemented with Matrigel\u2122 (25% v/v) embedded with cardiomyocyte (CM)-enriched neonatal rat heart cells and assembled into a contractile, macroporous, sheet-like construct. Modules (without RAEC) cultured in 10% bovine serum (BS) were more contractile and responsive to external stimulus (lower excitation threshold, higher maximum capture rate, and greater en face fractional area changes) than modules cultured in 10% fetal BS. Incorporating 25% Matrigel in the matrix reduced the excitation threshold and increased the fractional area change relative to collagen only modules (without RAEC). A coculture medium, containing 10% BS, low Mg2+ (0.814mM), and normal glucose (5.5mM), was used to maintain RAEC junction morphology (VE-cadherin) and CM contractility, although the responsiveness of CM was attenuated with RAEC on the modules. Macroporous, sheet-like module constructs were assembled by partially immobilizing a layer of modules in alginate gel until day 8, with or without RAEC. RAEC/CM module sheets were electrically responsive; however, like modules with RAEC this responsiveness was attenuated relative to CM-only sheets. Muscle bundles coexpressing cardiac troponin I and connexin-43 were evident near the perimeter of modules and at intermodule junctions. These results suggest the potential of the modular approach as a platform for building vascularized cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Most of the authors consider that the occipital artery is the main artery to the vascular supply of this region. The role of the posterior auricular artery has not been clearly investigated. In order to describe the cutaneous territories of these two arteries, 20 occipital areas have been dissected after bilateral injection of coloured latex (40 occipital and 40 posterior auricular arteries studied), and 4 occipital areas have been dissected after selective injection of china ink in the occipital and posterior auricular arteries (4 occipital and 4 posterior auricular arteries injected). The occipital artery was deep from its origin to the arch constituted by the insertions of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Then the occipital artery was becoming superficial while ascending to the vertex. The cutaneous territory of the occipital arteries was paramedian and median (38% of the occipital area). The posterior auricular artery was superficial in the auriculomastoid sulcus and divided into three branches: auricular and mastoid as usually described and also a third terminal branch that we called \"transverse nuchal artery\".

{"title": "Vascular Robo4 restricts proangiogenic VEGF signaling in breast.", "abstract": "Formation of the vascular system within organs requires the balanced action of numerous positive and negative factors secreted by stromal and epithelial cells. Here, we used a genetic approach to determine the role of SLITs in regulating the growth and organization of blood vessels in the mammary gland. We demonstrate that vascularization of the gland is not affected by loss of Slit expression in the epithelial compartment. Instead, we identify a stromal source of SLIT, mural cells encircling blood vessels, and show that loss of Slit in the stroma leads to elevated blood vessel density and complexity. We examine candidate SLIT receptors, Robo1 and Robo4, and find that increased vessel angiogenesis is phenocopied by loss of endothelial-specific Robo4, as long as it is combined with the presence of an angiogenic stimulus such as preneoplasia or pregnancy. In contrast, loss of Robo1 does not affect blood vessel growth. The enhanced growth of blood vessels in Robo4(-/-) endothelium is due to activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-R2 signaling through the Src and FAK kinases. Thus, our studies present a genetic dissection of SLIT/ROBO signaling during organ development.

Novel roles in cell survival and metabolic adaptation to hypoxia have been ascribed to the microsomal glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT).

In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro antiangiogenic impact of AD4-015 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), which play an essential role as structural and functional components in tumor angiogenesis. We found that in vitro HBMEC migration and tubulogenesis were reduced by AD4-015 but not by CHL. The mumbaistatin analog significantly inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 secretion and gene expression as assessed by zymography and RT-PCR. PMA-mediated cell signaling leading to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and IkappaB downregulation was also inhibited, further confirming AD4-015 as a cell signaling inhibitor in tumor promoting conditions.

Endodontically treated teeth are devitalized, susceptible to re-infections, fractures, and subsequent tooth loss. Here, we report regeneration of dental-pulp-like tissue by cell homing and without cell transplantation. Upon in vivo implantation of endodontically treated real-size, native human teeth in mouse dorsum for the tested 3 weeks, delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor and/or vascular endothelial growth factor (bFGF and/or VEGF) yielded re-cellularized and revascularized connective tissue that integrated to native dentinal wall in root canals. Further, combined delivery of bFGF, VEGF, or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) with a basal set of nerve growth factor (NGF) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) generated cellularized and vascularized tissues positive of VEGF antibody staining and apparent neo-dentin formation over the surface of native dentinal wall in some, but not all, endodontically treated teeth. Newly formed dental pulp tissue appeared dense with disconnected cells surrounded by extracellular matrix. Erythrocyte-filled blood vessels were present with endothelial-like cell lining. Reconstructed, multiple microscopic images showed complete fill of dental-pulp-like tissue in the entire root canal from root apex to pulp chamber with tissue integration to dentinal wall upon delivery of bFGF, VEGF, or PDGF with a basal set of NGF and BMP7.

However, the factors that coordinate EC-ASC communications to promote migration of these cells toward one another, and their heterotypic assembly into vascular structures are not well defined. To understand the mechanisms of EC-ASC interaction, we developed an in vitro model of coculturing ECs with ASCs in a system containing serum but no additional exogenous cytokines or extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We demonstrated that ASCs have a profound potential to stimulate morphogenesis of ECs into branching networks of cord structures. The vascular networks developed in 6 days and were stable for at least 3 weeks. This process was associated with an increase in ECM protein production by ASCs and ECs, alpha-smooth muscle actin expression by ASCs, and increased CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) surface presentation by ECs. The vascular network formation (VNF) was dependent on matrix metalloproteinase activity and cell communications through vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB pathways. ASCs exhibited significantly higher potential to stimulate VNF than smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Media conditioned by ASCs promoted VNF by ECs cultured on smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, but could not replace the presence of ASCs in coculture. The presence of ASCs in EC-fibroblast cocultures in a low fraction efficiently stimulated VNF. These findings demonstrate that the vasculogenesis-promoting potential of ASCs depends on interaction with ECs involving contact and likely bi-directional interaction, resulting in modulated secretion of cytokines and ECM proteins.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

MMP-2-inducing conditions (30% compression, 1&#x2009;Hz, 72&#x2009;h) were defined after varying loading parameters. Addition of the Golgi-disturbing agent Brefeldin A suppressed this mechanical upregulation of MMP-2. Analysis of enzymatic activities demonstrated an enhancement of pro-MMP-2, mature MMP-2, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-2. Further, mechano-regulation of MMP-14 and mature MMP-2 was dependent upon the activity of furin, a proprotein processing endoprotease. Angiogenesis was stimulated by conditioned media from MSCs loaded at inducing conditions. This augmentation of angiogenesis was hindered by inhibition of pro-MMP-2 and mature MMP-2. In conclusion, mechanical stimulation of MSCs in a three-dimensional matrix induces pro-MMP-2 secretion and MMP-2 activation, potentially via the activation complex consisting of MMP-2/-14/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-2. Mechano-regulated pro-MMP-2 and mature MMP-2 seem to contribute to angiogenesis stimulation. Thus, an application of these loading parameters could augment vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs based on the described MMP-2-dependent mechanism.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

We analysis limb function of reconstruction methods by tumor location following resection of pediatric malignant bone tumors.\nWe classified the tumors according to their location into 3 types by preoperative MRI, and evaluated reconstruction methods after wide resection, paying attention to whether the joint function could be preserved. The mean age of the patients was 10.6 years, Osteosarcoma was observed in 26 patients, Ewing's sarcoma in 3, and PNET(primitive neuroectodermal tumor) and chondrosarcoma (grade 1) in 1 each.\nType I were those located in the diaphysis, and reconstruction was performed using a vascularized fibular graft(vascularized fibular graft). Type 2 were those located in contact with the epiphyseal line or within 1 cm from this line, and VFG was performed in 1, and distraction osteogenesis in 1. Type III were those extending from the diaphysis to the epiphysis beyond the epiphyseal line, and a Growing Kotz was mainly used in 10 patients.

In this study, we examined the potential of erythrocyte PpIX fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), using an orthotopic metastatic mouse model. Balb/C-bearing Renca cells were treated with NIH/3T3-LendSN cells. Lung weight, nodule area, microvascular area (MVA), and erythrocyte PpIX fluorescence were evaluated. Emission spectra were obtained by exciting the samples at 405 nm. There was a significant decrease in lung wet weight, lung nodule area and MVA in the treated group compared to the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Significant differences in autofluorescence shape were observed in the 620-650 nm spectral region. The most intense fluorescence peak was observed at \u223c632 nm. The autofluorescence of the control samples was about 53% higher than that of normal blood (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

The increase in levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, an antiangiogenic agent known to inhibit placental vascularization, is an important cellular factor implicated in the onset of preeclampsia. We investigated the ligand urotensin II (U-II), a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and proangiogenic agent, for which levels have been reported to increase in patients with preeclampsia. We hypothesized that an increased sensitivity to U-II in preeclampsia might be achieved by upregulation of placental U-II receptors. We further investigated the role of U-II receptor stimulation on soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 release in placental explants from diseased and normal patients. Immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and Western blotting analysis revealed that U-II receptor expression was significantly upregulated in preeclampsia placentas compared with controls (P<0.01). Cellular models of syncytiotrophoblast and vascular endothelial cells subjected to hypoxic conditions revealed an increase in U-II receptor levels in the syncytiotrophoblast model. This induction is regulated by the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. U-II treatment is associated with increased secretion of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 only in preeclamptic placental explants under hypoxia but not in control conditions. Interestingly, normal placental explants did not respond to U-II stimulation.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2010-05-19", "authors": ["Phillip SGould", "MeiGu", "JianqinLiao", "ShakilAhmad", "Melissa JCudmore", "AsifAhmed", "ManuVatish"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.152074"}

{"title": "[Implication of hyaluronic acid in normal and pathological angiogenesis. Application for cellular engineering].", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a physiological process that allows the formation of new blood vessels, either from the local vascular structures, or from circulating endothelial progenitor cells, mobilized from the bone marrow, and attracted to the neovascularization site. This mechanism is controlled by pro-angiogenic molecules. It is crucial to supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues during growth, embryonic development or tissue regeneration in response to injuries. Thus, the dermis part of the skin is highly vascularized by a dense network of small and medium arteries and of capillaries and venules. In case of injury, rapid tissue repair is possible through this vascular network. However, once the vascularization is restored in tissue repair, the process of angiogenesis is negatively regulated by anti-angiogenic molecules. Controling the balance between pro-and anti-angiogenic agents is crucial and its deregulation leads to serious disease. The extracellular matrix plays an important role in controlling angiogenesis, allowing at least, the distribution of growth factors and the regulation of endothelial cell migration. Among these matrix components, hyaluronic acid plays a major role in the mechanical properties of connective tissues in ensuring their hydration. This glycosaminoglycan is a large size polymer, whose breakdown products strongly act on angiogenesis, especially in pathological situations (cancer, inflammation).

We determined the protein expression of VEGF and CD31, an endothelial marker, in a series of 56 surgically removed pituitary adenomas using Western blot assay. Prolactinomas had higher VEGF protein expression compared to nonfunctioning or ACTH- and GH-secreting adenomas, while CD31 was similar in the different adenoma histotypes. VEGF and CD31 were not affected by sex, age, years of adenoma evolution, or proliferation rate (Ki67 and PCNA) for all adenoma types. Only in nonfunctioning adenomas CD31 concentration increased significantly with age. There was a positive correlation between CD31 and VEGF expression when all adenoma histotypes were considered, or when prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas were evaluated separately.

{"title": "Antivascular effects of electrochemotherapy: implications in treatment of bleeding metastases.", "abstract": "Solid tumors of various etiologies can be treated efficiently by electrochemotherapy (ECT), a combined use of electroporation (EP) and chemotherapeutic drugs, such as bleomycin and cisplatin. EP alone and ECT in particular, induce a profound reduction in tumor blood flow, which contributes to the antitumor effect. After EP and ECT, the time course of blood flow changes and follows the same two-phase pattern. The first rapid and short-lived vasoconstriction phase is followed by the second much longer-lived phase resulting from disrupted cytoskeletal structures and a compromised barrier function of the microvascular endothelium. In the case of ECT, however, tumor vascular endothelial cells are also affected by the chemotherapeutic drug, which leads to irrecoverable damage to tumor vessels and to a further decrease in tumor blood flow within hours after application of ECT. Tumor cells surviving the direct effects of ECT are consequently exposed to lack of oxygen and nutrients and are pushed into the secondary cascade of induced cell death. Clinically, the antitumor effectiveness of ECT has been proven extensively in the treatment of melanoma metastases, with 70-80% complete responses. The antivascular effects of ECT were also exploited for palliative treatment of bleeding melanoma metastases, with immediate cessation of bleeding and very good antitumor effectiveness.

{"title": "Donor pancreata: evolving approaches to organ allocation for whole pancreas versus islet transplantation.", "abstract": "As islet transplantation increasingly enters the clinical arena, its coexistence with vascularized pancreas transplantation makes it necessary to reassess the questions of donor selection and allocation. In answering these questions, one must put in the balance the short-term morbidity of pancreas transplantation with the long-term attrition of islet grafts. The preferential allocation of pancreases from obese and older donors for islet isolation has been based on their association with worse pancreas transplant outcomes and better islet isolation results in islet yields. In this overview, we show that transplanted islet mass does not necessarily correlate with graft function and make the case that donor selection criteria for islet transplantation, and hence allocation rules, may need to be redefined.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2010-05-14", "authors": ["ThierryBerney", "Paul R VJohnson"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e25a40"}

The Wise pattern skin-reducing mastectomy often provides the best options for shape and symmetry, but is not without morbidity. The authors reviewed their experience with a modified Wise pattern mastectomy and tissue expander reconstruction to improve safety.\nAll patients with breast cancer who underwent a skin-sparing mastectomy and modified Wise pattern skin-reducing reconstruction with a tissue expander were included. A dual-plane technique was used by covering the expander with the pectoralis muscle and a vascularized lower pole fasciocutaneous flap. Patient demographics were queried and outcomes were assessed.\nTwenty-seven patients (34 breasts) underwent tissue expander reconstruction using the dual-plane vascularized coverage technique. The average body mass index was 34 (range, 24 to 42). The average contralateral reduction weight was 502 g on all 20 unilateral reconstructions. Postoperative complications occurred in 37 percent of the patients (10 of 27), with seroma being the most common [six of 34 reconstructions (18 percent)]. The unplanned reoperation rate was 15 percent. The average follow-up was 16 months (range, 2 months to 4.5 years).\nThe authors have demonstrated that modifications to the Wise pattern mastectomy with a tissue expander using a dual plane of vascularized tissue coverage can optimize results in patients with breast cancer and macromastia.

Some of these defects--such as postosteitic hollowed out calcaneal bones--may profit from a simultaneous vascularized bone transplantation. The authors' experiences with 109 successive muscular and newly developed osteomuscular peroneus flaps are outlined for small to medium combined defects in this region.\nOne hundred nine patients with various soft-tissue and skeletal defects underwent reconstruction with proximally (n = 10) or distally pedicled (n = 98) or free microvascular transplanted (n = 1) peroneus brevis flaps. Eight patients received a composite flap of the peroneus brevis muscle with an attached lateral split fibula segment.\nIn 72.5 percent of the cases, a stable defect closure was achieved without significant secondary procedures. In 16.5 percent, further operations such as secondary wound closure or flaps were necessary, most often because of the avascular loss of the 1 to 3 cm of the distal flap tip. Nine flaps (8.3 percent) were lost completely. Seven of eight osteomuscular flaps demonstrated stable bony healing, and full weight bearing was achieved. No relevant donor-site complications were seen.\nThe peroneus brevis is a valuable flap for defect closure around the ankle and lower leg. It can be harvested together with a vascularized split fibula segment, representing a simple alternative to several free composite flaps. Its complication rate can be lowered significantly if the proximal 3 cm of the muscle origin (i.e., the flap tip in distally pedicled flaps) is discarded during dissection and delicate hemostasis is performed.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2010-05-14", "authors": ["Andreas BSchmidt", "Goetz AGiessler"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181e3b74d"}

Adipose tissue-derived stem cells promote tissue repair and vascularization and may increase the rate or degree of tissue incorporation. The authors hypothesized that introducing these cells into bioprosthetic mesh would result in adipose tissue-derived stem cell engraftment and proliferation and enhance incorporation of the bioprosthetic mesh.\nAdipose tissue-derived stem cells were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of syngeneic Brown Norway rats, expanded in vitro, and labeled with green fluorescent protein. Thirty-six additional rats underwent inlay ventral hernia repair with porcine acellular dermal matrix. Two 12-rat groups had the cells (1.0 x 10(6)) injected directly into the musculofascial/porcine acellular dermal matrix interface after repair or received porcine acellular dermal matrix on which the cells had been preseeded; the 12-rat control group received no stem cells.\nAt 2 weeks, adipose tissue-derived stem cells in both stem cell groups engrafted, survived, migrated, and proliferated. Mean cellular infiltration into porcine acellular dermal matrix at the musculofascial/graft interface was significantly greater in the preseeded and injected stem cell groups than in the control group. Mean vascular infiltration of the porcine acellular dermal matrix was significantly greater in both stem cell groups than in the control group.\nPreseeded and injected adipose tissue-derived stem cells engraft, migrate, proliferate, and enhance the vascularity of porcine acellular dermal matrix grafts at the musculofascial/graft interface.

Infants with ROP were more likely to have mothers with mHTN and to be younger and smaller at birth. At initial examination, more infants of mothers with mHTN had vascularization into the lower zones than did infants of mothers without mHTN (P < 0.001). However, at the examination in which the most severe ROP was present, there was no association between mHTN and ROP stage (P = 0.2342).

{"title": "Inhibition of neovascularization to simultaneously ameliorate graft-vs-host disease and decrease tumor growth.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Blood vessels are formed either by sprouting of resident tissue endothelial cells (angiogenesis) or by recruitment of bone marrow (BM)-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, vasculogenesis). Neovascularization has been implicated in tumor growth and inflammation, but its roles in graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and in tumors after allogeneic BM transplantation (allo-BMT) were not known. METHODS We analyzed neovascularization, the contribution of endothelial cells and EPCs, and the ability of anti-vascular endothelial-cadherin antibody, E4G10, to inhibit neovascularization in mice with GVHD after allo-BMT using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. We examined survival and clinical and histopathologic GVHD in mice (n = 10-25 per group) in which GVHD was treated with the E4G10 antibody using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and cytokine immunoassay. We also assessed survival, the contribution of green fluorescent protein-marked EPCs to the tumor vasculature, and the ability of E4G10 to inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice (n = 20-33 per group) after allo-BMT using histopathology and bioluminescence imaging. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS We found increased neovascularization mediated by vasculogenesis, as opposed to angiogenesis, in GVHD target tissues, such as liver and intestines. Administration of E4G10 inhibited neovascularization by donor BM-derived cells without affecting host vascularization, inhibited both GVHD and tumor growth, and increased survival (at 60 days post-BMT and tumor challenge with A20 lymphoma, the probability of survival was 0.29 for control antibody-treated allo-BMT recipients vs 0.7 for E4G10-treated allo-BMT recipients, 95% confidence interval = 0.180 to 0.640, P < .001).

{"title": "Anatomic basis of ulnar index metacarpal reverse flow vascularized bone graft for index distal bone loss.", "abstract": "Well-known advantages of vascularized bone grafts led us to determine the anatomical basis of a metacarpal vascularized bone graft to find a solution for distal index bone loss. Seventeen adult human hands from fresh cadavers were dissected and analyzed. For each hand, we studied the second dorsal metacarpal artery, the ulnar dorsal proper digital artery of index, and the ulnar palmar proper digital artery of the index. Location, diameters, origins, and anastomoses were observed, and at the end, the vascularised bone graft was raised. The second dorsal metacarpal artery was present in all hands, always arising from the dorsal carpal arch with a 1-mm mean diameter. The ulnar dorsal proper digital artery of index was isolated on all dissections, with a subcutaneous location on the ulno-dorsal side of the proximal phalanx. The mean diameter of ulnar dorsal proper digital artery at the level of index proximal phalanx was 0.4\u00a0mm. We found anastomotic branches between the ulnar dorsal and palmar proper digital artery of index at the level of the proximal phalanx which permitted us to elevate a vascularised bone graft. We succeeded in removing the graft in all specimens. Its pivot point was always more distal than the middle of the proximal phalanx. The arc of rotation allowed the graft to reach the distal phalanx in 80% of the cases. This anatomical study has demonstrated the theoretical possibility of a reversed pedicled bone graft taken from the ulnar neck of the second metacarpal. This graft brings the following benefits: (a) the use of a minor vascular axis, (b) a surgical technique with a dorsal approach allowing the elevation and the use of the graft at the same time.

{"title": "Anatomical and microstructural imaging of angiogenesis.", "abstract": "This article reviews and discusses different options for visualizing the microarchitecture of vessels ex vivo and in vivo with respect to reliability, practicability and availability.\nThe investigation of angiogenesis by standard histological methods, like microvessel density counts, is limited since the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture and the functionality of vessels cannot be considered properly. Coregistration of immunostained images of vessels may be performed but is time consuming and often not sufficiently accurate. Confocal fluorescence microscopy is an alternative, but only enables 3-D stacks of less than 500 nm in thickness. Multiphoton microscopy and other advanced technologies, such as optical coherence tomography and optical frequency domain imaging, provide a deeper view into tissues and allow for in vivo imaging of microvessels, which is a precondition for longitudinal studies. Besides these microscopic techniques, the vascularization in larger tissue samples can be investigated using corrosion casts in combination with scanning electron microscopy, or microcomputed tomography (microCT). Furthermore, recent improvements in microCT technology open up new perspectives for in vivo scans with high resolution and tolerable X-ray doses. Also 3-D contrast-enhanced high-frequency ultrasound has been shown to be sensitive for angiogenic vessels and even distinguishing between mature and immature vessels appears feasible. Microvessel architecture can also be visualized by MRI. Here, T1-weighted angiography techniques after injection of blood pool contrast agents appear preferable.

In this follow-up study, the effects of progesterone, MPA, norgestrel (N-EL), and norethindrone (N-ONE) on BT-474 xenograft tumors were compared in the context of several different hormonal environments. N-EL and N-ONE were included in the study because synthetic progestins vary considerably in their biological effects and the effects of these two progestins on the growth of human tumor xenografts are not known.\nEstradiol-supplemented intact and ovariectomized immunodeficient mice were implanted with BT-474 cells. Progestin pellets were implanted simultaneously with estradiol pellets either 2 days before tumor cell injection (ie, combined) or 5 days after tumor cell injections (ie, sequentially).\nProgestins stimulated the growth of BT-474 xenograft tumors independent of exposure timing and protocol, MPA stimulated the growth of BT-474 xenograft tumors in ovariectomized mice, and progestins stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor elaboration and increased tumor vascularity. Progestins also increased lymph node metastasis of BT-474 cells. Therefore, progestins, including N-EL and N-ONE, induce the progression of breast cancer xenografts in nude mice and promote tumor metastasis.\nThese observations suggest that women who ingest progestins for hormone therapy or oral contraception could be more at risk for developing breast cancer because of proliferation of existing latent tumor cells.

To define the regulators of these phenotypes, we performed a proteomic comparison of multiple human chondrogenic tumors, which revealed differential accumulation of the C-propeptides of procollagens Ialpha1 and II (PC1CP and PC2CP) in malignant versus benign tumors, respectively. Expression patterns of PC1CP correlated with levels of tumor vascularization, whereas expression patterns of PC2CP suggested its susceptibility to immobilization within the extracellular matrix. Prompted by these observations, we investigated the functions of recombinant PC1CP and PC2CP in the extracellular matrix in soluble or immobilized states. Each induced beta1 integrin-mediated chondrocyte adhesion by distinct domains and efficacies, suggesting that they initiated distinct signaling pathways. Indeed, immobilized PC2CP, but not PC1CP, induced apoptosis of primary chondrocytes and EAhy926 endothelial cells. In contrast, soluble PC1CP, but not PC2CP, induced the migration of EAhy926 cells and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CXCR4 expression in chondrocytes. Soluble PC2CP also increased VEGF expression, but along with a more pronounced effect on CXCR4 and matrix metalloproteinase 13 expression. Our findings suggest that PC1CP favors angiogenesis and tumor progression, but that PC2CP acts in a more complex manner, exerting antitumor and antiangiogenic properties through apoptosis induction when immobilized, but progression and metastasis when soluble.

The relatively poor vascularization of tendons is considered to be one of the reasons for their limited healing potential. Recently, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), an autologous concentrate of platelets, rich in growth factors, has been shown to enhance the repair process of injured tendons. This effect has been ascribed to the high levels of growth factors in PRP, several of which are known to be involved in tendon repair. Among many other growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor, a powerful stimulator of angiogenesis, is abundantly present in PRP, suggesting that enhancement of neovascularization might be one of the working mechanisms. In this study, the effect of PRP on neovascularization was studied in experimentally induced tendon injuries using color Doppler ultrasonography and immunological staining of Factor VIII. PRP induced significantly more neovascularization than the placebo treatment until at least 23 weeks after treatment, as detected by both Doppler ultrasonography and Factor VIII staining.

{"title": "Optoacoustic imaging of the prostate: development toward image-guided biopsy.", "abstract": "Optoacoustic (OA) tomography has demonstrated utility in identifying blood-rich malignancies in breast tissue. We describe the development and characterization of a laser OA imaging system for the prostate (LOIS-P). The system consists of a fiber-coupled Q-switched laser operating at 757 nm, a commercial 128-channel ultrasonic probe, a digital signal processor, and software that uses the filtered radial back-projection algorithm for image reconstruction. The system is used to reconstruct OA images of a blood-rich lesion induced in vivo in a canine prostate. OA images obtained in vivo are compared to images acquired using ultrasound, the current gold standard for guiding biopsy of the prostate. Although key structural features such as the urethra could be identified with both imaging techniques, a bloody lesion representing a highly vascularized tumor could only be clearly identified in OA images.

{"title": "Repetitive nicotine exposure leads to a more malignant and metastasis-prone phenotype of SCLC: a molecular insight into the importance of quitting smoking during treatment.", "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is strongly correlated with the onset of lung cancer. Nicotine, a major component in cigarette smoke, has been found to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, as well as protect cancer cells from apoptosis. Among all lung cancer cases, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is found almost exclusively in smokers; metastasis and chemoresistance are the main reasons for the high mortality rates associated with SCLC. Retrospective studies have shown that patients with tobacco-related cancers who continue to smoke after their diagnosis display lower response rates and a shorter median survival compared with those who stop smoking. In the current work, we examined the effects of acute and repetitive exposure to nicotine, in the concentrations found in the lungs of active smokers, on the malignant properties of N417 SCLC cells in vitro. We observed that repetitive nicotine exposure induced a neuronal-like appearance in N417 cells along with increased adhesion to the extracellular matrix and chemoresistance. These changes were accompanied by enhanced migration through collagen matrices and adhesion to and transmigration across lymphatic endothelial cell monolayers. SCLC differentiation reverted after cessation of nicotine exposure. Here, we provide evidence for the leading role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in these phenomena. Finally, we show how nicotine-differentiated N417 cells produced bigger and more vascularized tumors in mice, with lower apoptotic rates, than their nondifferentiated counterparts. In short, these findings identify the mechanisms through which nicotine increases SCLC malignancy and provide further evidence that CXCR4 is a potential anticancer target for nicotine-associated SCLC.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2010-05-12", "authors": ["EvaMart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda", "MartaIrigoyen", "OscarGonz\u00e1lez-Moreno", "LeticiaCorrales", "AlvaroTeijeira", "ElizabethSalvo", "AnaRouzaut"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfq138"}

However, one of the main limitations in tissue engineering is vascularization of the construct before implantation. Such a vascularization could play an important role in graft perfusion and host integration of tissue-engineered vascular adventitia. Using our self-assembly approach, we developed a method to vascularize tissue-engineered blood vessel constructs by coculturing endothelial cells in a fibroblast-laden tissue sheet. After subcutaneous implantation, enhancement of graft integration within the surrounding environment was noted after 48 h and an important improvement in blood circulation of the grafted tissue at 1 week postimplantation. The distinctive branching structure of end arteries characterizing the in vivo adventitial vasa vasorum has also been observed in long-term postimplantation follow-up. After a 90-day implantation period, hybrid vessels containing human and mouse endothelial cells were still perfused. Characterization of the mechanical properties of both control and vascularized adventitia demonstrated that the ultimate tensile strength, modulus, and failure strain were in the same order of magnitude of a pig coronary artery. The addition of a vasa vasorum to the tissue-engineered adventitia did not influence the burst pressure of these constructs.

{"title": "HEXIM1 modulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression and function in breast epithelial cells and mammary gland.", "abstract": "Recently, we found that mutation of the C-terminus of transcription factor hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) in mice leads to abnormalities in cardiovascular development because of aberrant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. HEXIM1 regulation of some genes has also been shown to be positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) dependent. However, it is not known whether HEXIM1 regulates VEGF in the mammary gland. We demonstrate that HEXIM1 regulates estrogen-induced VEGF transcription through inhibition of estrogen receptor-alpha recruitment to the VEGF promoter in a P-TEFb-independent manner in MCF-7 cells. Under hypoxic conditions, HEXIM1 inhibits estrogen-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression and recruitment of HIF-1alpha to the hypoxia-response element in the VEGF promoter. In the mouse mammary gland, increased HEXIM1 expression decreased estrogen-driven VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression. Conversely, a mutation in the C-terminus of HEXIM1 (HEXIM1(1-312)) led to increased VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression and vascularization in mammary glands of heterozygous HEXIM1(1-312) mice when compared with their wild-type littermates. In addition, HEXIM1(1-312) mice have a higher incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors with increased vascularization, suggesting an inhibitory role for HEXIM1 during angiogenesis.

We investigated whether human bone marrow CD133(+)-derived cells (BM-CD133(+) cells) might be used for cell therapy of heart injury in combination with tissue engineering. We examined these cells for: 1) their in vitro capacity to be converted into cardiomyocytes (CMs), and 2) their potential for in vivo differentiation when delivered to a tissue-engineered type I collagen patch placed on injured hearts (group II). To ensure a microvascular network ready for use by the transplanted cells, cardiac injury and patching were scheduled 2 weeks before cell injection. The cardiovascular potential of the BM-CD133(+) cells was compared with that of a direct injection (group I) of the same cells in heart tissue damaged according to the same schedule as for group II. While a small fraction (2 \u00b1 0.5%) of BM-CD133(+)cells cocultured with rat CMs switched in vitro to a CM-like cell phenotype, in vivo-and in both groups of nude rats transplanted with BM-CD133(+)--there was no evidence of any CM differentiation (as detected by cardiac troponin I expression), but there were signs instead of new capillaries and small arterioles. While capillaries prevailed over arterioles in group II, the opposite occurred in group I. The transplanted cells further contributed to the formation of new microvessels induced by the patch (group II) but the number of vessels did not appear superior to the one developed after directly injecting the BM-CD133(+)cells into the injured heart. Although chimeric human-rat microvessels were consistently found in the hearts of both groups I and II, they represented a minority (1.5-2.3%) compared with those of rat origin. Smooth muscle myosin isoform expression suggested that the arterioles achieved complete differentiation irrespective of the presence or absence of the collagen patch. These findings suggest that: 1) BM-CD133(+) cells display a limited propensity for in vitro conversion to CMs; 2) the preliminarily vascularized bioscaffold did not confer a selective homing and differentiation advantage for the phenotypic conversion of BM-CD133(+) cells into CMs; and 3) combined patching and cell transplantation is suitable for angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, but it does not produce better results, in terms of endothelial and smooth muscle cell differentiation, than the \"traditional\" method of cell injection into the myocardium.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2010-05-08", "authors": ["MPozzobon", "SBollini", "LIop", "PDe Gaspari", "AChiavegato", "C ARossi", "SGiuliani", "FFascetti Leon", "NElvassore", "SSartore", "PDe Coppi"], "doi": "10.3727/096368910X505864"}

{"title": "Ephrin-B2 regulates VEGFR2 function in developmental and tumour angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The formation and guidance of specialized endothelial tip cells is essential for both developmental and pathological angiogenesis. Notch-1 signalling regulates the generation of tip cells, which respond to gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). The molecular cues and signalling pathways that control the guidance of tip cells are poorly understood. Bidirectional signalling by Eph receptors and ephrin ligands represents one of the most important guidance cues involved in axon path finding. Here we show that ephrin-B2 reverse signalling involving PDZ interactions regulates endothelial tip cell guidance to control angiogenic sprouting and branching in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. In vivo, ephrin-B2 PDZ-signalling-deficient mice (ephrin-B2DeltaV) exhibit a reduced number of tip cells with fewer filopodial extensions at the vascular front in the mouse retina. In pathological settings, impaired PDZ signalling decreases tumour vascularization and growth. Mechanistically, we show that ephrin-B2 controls VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 internalization and signalling. Importantly, internalization of VEGFR2 is necessary for activation and downstream signalling of the receptor and is required for VEGF-induced tip cell filopodial extension. Together, our results suggest that ephrin-B2 at the tip cell filopodia regulates the proper spatial activation of VEGFR2 endocytosis and signalling to direct filopodial extension. Blocking ephrin-B2 reverse signalling may be an attractive alternative or combinatorial anti-angiogenic therapy strategy to disrupt VEGFR2 function in tumour angiogenesis.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2010-05-07", "authors": ["SuphansaSawamiphak", "SaschaSeidel", "Clara LEssmann", "George AWilkinson", "Mara EPitulescu", "TillAcker", "AmparoAcker-Palmer"], "doi": "10.1038/nature08995"}
{"title": "Flow of energy in the outer retina in darkness and in light.", "abstract": "Structural features of neurons create challenges for effective production and distribution of essential metabolic energy. We investigated how metabolic energy is distributed between cellular compartments in photoreceptors. In avascular retinas, aerobic production of energy occurs only in mitochondria that are located centrally within the photoreceptor. Our findings indicate that metabolic energy flows from these central mitochondria as phosphocreatine toward the photoreceptor's synaptic terminal in darkness. In light, it flows in the opposite direction as ATP toward the outer segment. Consistent with this model, inhibition of creatine kinase in avascular retinas blocks synaptic transmission without influencing outer segment activity. Our findings also reveal how vascularization of neuronal tissue can influence the strategies neurons use for energy management. In vascularized retinas, mitochondria in the synaptic terminals of photoreceptors make neurotransmission less dependent on creatine kinase. Thus, vasculature of the tissue and the intracellular distribution of mitochondria can play key roles in setting the strategy for energy distribution in neurons.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2010-05-07", "authors": ["Jonathan DLinton", "Lars CHolzhausen", "NorbertBabai", "HongmanSong", "Kiyoharu JMiyagishima", "George WStearns", "KenLindsay", "JunhuaWei", "Andrei OChertov", "Theo APeters", "RomeoCaffe", "HelmaPluk", "Mathias WSeeliger", "NaoyukiTanimoto", "KimberlyFong", "LauraBolton", "Denise L TKuok", "Ian RSweet", "Theodore MBartoletti", "Roxana ARadu", "Gabriel HTravis", "Willam NZagotta", "EllenTownes-Anderson", "EdParker", "Catharina E E MVan der Zee", "Alapakkam PSampath", "MaximSokolov", "Wallace BThoreson", "James BHurley"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1002471107"}

We investigated metabolic changes during the maturation of the CAM by (1)H NMR-based metabolic profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics), allowing simultaneous measurements of many metabolites in an untargeted fashion. Specifically, we examined the time course of the measured metabolites to elucidate common patterns of regulation. Three clusters of metabolites were observed that correspond to essential biological processes active in the CAM with similar dynamics. The time courses common to the metabolite clusters distinguished specific stages of vessel growth, identifying waste product metabolites being stored in the CAM and energy-related substrates decreasing during embryonic growth. Using this top-down approach, combined with existing microarray data, we could link gene expression to metabolic consequences during the growth of a vascularized organ. For example, transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that many transcripts involved in the TCA cycle were down-regulated during CAM development, which correlated with the decrease in levels of TCA precursors and intermediates seen in the metabolite data. Taken together, this paper provides the first metabonomic study in an embryonic tissue where vessel development is the most active morphogenic process.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2010-05-07", "authors": ["RachelCavill", "Jasmin KSidhu", "WitoldKilarski", "SophieJaverzat", "MartinHagedorn", "Timothy M DEbbels", "AndreasBikfalvi", "Hector CKeun"], "doi": "10.1021/pr100033t"}
{"title": "Radioimmunotherapy with radioactive nanoparticles: biological doses and treatment efficiency for vascularized tumors with or without a central hypoxic area.", "abstract": "Radioactive atoms attached to monoclonal antibodies are used in radioimmunotherapy to treat cancer while limiting radiation to healthy tissues. One limitation of this method is that only one radioactive atom is linked to each antibody and the deposited dose is often insufficient to eradicate solid and radioresistant tumors. In a previous study, simulations with the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended code showed that physical doses up to 50 Gy can be delivered inside tumors by replacing the single radionuclide by a radioactive nanoparticle of 5 nm diameter containing hundreds of radioactive atoms. However, tumoral and normal tissues are not equally sensitive to radiation, and previous works did not take account the biological effects such as cellular repair processes or the presence of less radiosensitive cells such as hypoxic cells.\nThe idea is to adapt the linear-quadratic expression to the tumor model and to determine biological effective doses (BEDs) delivered through and around a tumor. This BED is then incorporated into a Poisson formula to determine the shell control probability (SCP) which predicts the cell cluster-killing efficiency at different distances \"r\" from the center of the tumor. BED and SCP models are used to analyze the advantages of injecting radioactive nanoparticles instead of a single radionuclide per vector in radioimmunotherapy.\nCalculations of BED and SCP for different distances r from the center of a solid tumor, using the non-small-cell lung cancer as an example, were investigated for 90Y2O3 nanoparticles. With a total activity of about 3.5 and 20 MBq for tumor radii of 0.5 and 1.0 cm, respectively, results show that a very high BED is deposited in the well oxygenated part of the spherical carcinoma.\nFor either small or large solid tumors, BED and SCP calculations highlight the important benefit in replacing the single beta-emitter 90Y attached to each antibody by a 90Y2O3 nanoparticle.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2010-05-07", "authors": ["VBouchat", "V ENuttens", "CMichiels", "BMasereel", "OFeron", "BGallez", "TVander Borght", "SLucas"], "doi": "10.1118/1.3368599"}

In previous studies, the authors have shown the localization accuracy and the high frame-rate image acquisition on simple phantoms with limited medical relevance. The purpose of this study was to test the imaging capabilities of SPAI in the context of breast tumor detection and localization.\nThe authors constructed an array of phantoms that include spherical lesions of sizes 1.5-9 mm, buried in highly scattering tissue phantoms at depths of 3-30 mm. The authors investigated both homogeneous lesions made of blood at varying concentrations and heterogeneous lesions containing vessel-like structures. Volumetric images of the deeply buried lesions were taken at increasingly shallower depths and image-based localization was compared to measured depth.\nThe authors were able to detect and accurately localize homogeneous lesions having a realistic absorption coefficient of 0.2 cm(-1) down to depths of 9-20 mm, and heterogeneous lesions containing 0.5 mm diameter vessel-like structures down to depths of 13-20 mm. Image acquisition required 2.5 s for each volumetric lesion image.\nThese results suggest that 3D SPAI can detect highly vascularized lesions well below 1 cm in diameter and can overcome optical scatter of tissue to depths of 1-2 cm. With further improvement in the sensitivity and noise characteristics of the imaging system, similar imaging depths should be within reach in real breast tissue.

RWPs reduced expression of VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and cyclooxygenase-2 and increased expression of tumor suppressor genes p16(INK4A), p53, and p73 in tumor cells. In rats, RWPs reduced by 49% the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (preneoplastic lesions) in colon.

Different strategies are being developed to either prevent tumor angiogenesis or disrupt the tumor vasculature already in place. In this in vitro study, we investigated the antivascular properties of ENMD-1198, a new anticancer drug currently in clinical trials. ENMD-1198 is a new analogue of 2-methoxyestradiol, a microtubule-targeting agent that has shown promising results in the treatment of multiple myeloma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Using both bone marrow-derived and dermal microvascular endothelial cell lines, we analyzed the effect of ENMD-1198 on the different functions of endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis. In both cell lines, ENMD-1198 was more potent than 2-methoxyestradiol at inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, motility, migration, and morphogenesis. In addition, ENMD-1198 induced a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 protein expression in endothelial cells. Furthermore, videomicroscopy experiments showed that ENMD-1198 was able to completely disrupt preformed vascular structures within 2 hours. This vascular-disrupting activity was associated with extensive depolymerization of the microtubule network and accumulation of actin stress fibers and large focal adhesions in vascular endothelial cells.

Patients with cirrhosis and early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may have either malignant or benign (fibrin clot) portal vein thrombosis. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively whether well-defined diagnostic criteria would enable the nature of portal vein thrombosis to be established in patients with HCC under consideration for liver transplantation. Benign portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed by the application of the following criteria: lack of vascularization of the thrombus on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, absence of mass-forming features of the thrombus, absence of disruption of the walls of veins, and, if uncertainty persisted, biopsy of the thrombus for histological examination. Patients who did not fulfill the criteria for benign thrombosis were not placed on the transplantation list. In this study, all patients evaluated at our center during 2001-2007 with a diagnosis of HCC in whom portal vein thrombosis was concurrently or subsequently diagnosed were discussed by a multidisciplinary group to determine their suitability for liver transplantation. The outcomes for 33 patients who met the entry criteria of the study were as follows: in 14 patients who were placed on the transplantation list and underwent liver transplantation, no malignant thrombosis was detected when liver explants were examined histologically; 5 patients who were placed on the transplantation list either remained on the list or died from causes unrelated to HCC; in 9 patients, liver transplantation was contraindicated on account of a strong suspicion, or confirmation, of the presence of malignant portal vein thrombosis; and 5 patients who were initially placed on the transplantation list were subsequently removed from it on account of progression of HCC in the absence of evidence of neoplastic involvement of thrombosis.

Tissue engineering of the esophagus may provide the solution for esophageal loss. In our attempts to engineer the esophagus, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of generating vascularized in situ esophageal conduits using the ovine model.\nEsophageal biopsies were obtained from lambs, and ovine esophageal epithelial cells (OEEC) were proliferated. The OEEC were seeded on to bovine collagen sheets preseeded with fibroblasts. After 2 weeks of maintaining the constructs in vitro, the constructs were tubularized on stents to create a tube resembling the esophagus and implanted into the omentum for in situ tissue engineering. The edges of the omentum were sutured using nonabsorbable suture material. The implanted constructs were retrieved after 8 and 12 weeks.\nThe omental wrap provided vascular growth within and around the constructs as they were integrated along the outer surface area of the scaffold. After removal of the stents, the engineered conduit revealed a structure similar to the esophagus. Histologic investigations demonstrated esophageal epithelium organization into patches on the luminal side and vascular ingrowths on the conduit's outer perimeter.\nOur study demonstrated the seeding of OEEC on collagen scaffolds and formation of a rudimentary conduit resembling esophageal morphology after in situ omental implantation.

Eight patients underwent total removal of the auricle and 26 ones its resection. Extensive resection of the tumour in 36 patients was immediately followed by plastic reconstruction of the resulting defect on the outer ear with the use of the following graft varieties: rotation cutaneous flap (n=22), composite musculocutaneous flap vascularized by a. thoracoabdominalis (n=2), and free full-thickness cutaneous flap (n=4); Trendelenburg operation was performed in 8 patients. Clinical efficiency of the new method for the reconstruction of the defect in the initial portion of the external auditory canal using rotation cellulocutaneous postaural flap was evaluated. It is concluded that surgical treatment of external ear malignant tumours results in rather a high frequency of postoperative wound healing by first intention (91.5%).

The potency of mouse, cobra and viper NGFs to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation in ECs was higher than in neurons. In ECs, mNGF exhibited the highest efficacy of stimulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, followed by viper and cobra NGFs.

We utilized zebrafish and mouse ES cells to investigate the role of copeb in endoderm specification and hepatogenesis separate from its function in angiogenesis. During zebrafish development, copeb expression is enriched in digestive organs. Morpholino knockdown of copeb blocks expansion of the liver, pancreas and intestine, but does not affect their specification, differentiation or the vascularization of the liver. Decreased hepatocyte proliferation in copeb morphants is accompanied by upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor, cdkn1a, a Copeb transcriptional target.

Our goal is to integrate in vitro liver experiments with agent-based cellular models to simulate a spatially extended hepatic lobule. Here we describe a graphical model of the sinusoidal network that efficiently simulates portal to centrilobular mass transfer in the hepatic lobule. We analyzed the effects of vascular topology and metabolism on the cell-level distribution following oral exposure to chemicals. The spatial distribution of metabolically inactive chemicals was similar across different vascular networks and a baseline well-mixed compartment. When chemicals were rapidly metabolized, concentration heterogeneity of the parent compound increased across the vascular network. As a result, our spatially extended lobule generated greater variability in dose-dependent cellular responses, in this case apoptosis, than were observed in the classical well-mixed liver or in a parallel tubes model.

In this study, we examined the role of CCR2 in monocyte recruitment and alloimmune responses in a mouse model of vascularized orthotopic lung transplantation. The CCR2 ligand MCP-1 is upregulated in serum and allografts following lung transplantation. CCR2 is critical for the mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow into the bloodstream and for the accumulation of CD11c(+) cells within lung allografts. A portion of graft-infiltrating recipient CD11c(+) cells expresses both recipient and donor MHC molecules. Two-photon imaging demonstrates that recipient CD11c(+) cells are associated with recipient T cells within the graft. While recipient CCR2 deficiency does not prevent acute lung rejection and is associated with increased graft infiltration by T cells, it significantly reduces CD4(+) T(h)1 indirect and direct allorecognition.

Although first described over 60 years ago, its molecular etiology remains poorly understood. Recent work revealed that ABCs harbor translocation of TRE17/USP6, leading to its transcriptional upregulation. TRE17 encodes a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), and a TBC domain that mediates binding to the Arf6 GTPase. However, the mechanisms by which TRE17 overexpression contributes to tumor pathogenesis, and the role of its USP and TBC domains, are unknown. ABCs are characterized by osteolysis, inflammatory recruitment and extensive vascularization, the processes in which matrix proteases have a prominent role. This led us to explore whether TRE17 regulates the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we show that TRE17 is sufficient to induce expression of MMP-9 and MMP-10, in a manner requiring its USP activity, but not its ability to bind Arf6. TRE17 induces transcription of MMP-9 through activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mediated in part by the GTPase RhoA and its effector kinase, ROCK. Furthermore, xenograft studies show that TRE17 induces formation of tumors that reproduce multiple features of ABC, including a high degree of vascularization, with an essential role for the USP domain. In sum, these studies reveal that TRE17 is sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis, identify MMPs as novel TRE17 effectors that likely contribute to ABC pathogenesis and define the underlying signaling mechanism of their induction.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2010-04-27", "authors": ["YYe", "L MPringle", "A WLau", "D NRiquelme", "HWang", "TJiang", "DLev", "AWelman", "G ABlobel", "A MOliveira", "M MChou"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2010.116"}

Considering the recent studies that question previously reported cardio-protective effects of estrogen, there is a growing concern that estrogenic environmental compounds may contribute to the pathology of vascular lesion formation.\nReal-time quantitative PCR was used to monitor the expression of genes involved in vascularization. Using Bayesian network modeling, we determined a gene network that estrogenic chemicals modulate in human vascular endothelial cells.\nWe showed that planar and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induce the expression of different genes compared to estradiol. Non-planar PCB congener 153 induced NOTCH3 which is a new finding as well as CCL2 and IL8 similar to what has been reported by other non-planar PCBs in endothelial cells. Our gene network indicated that experimental treatments signal a network containing TGF-beta receptor and NOTCH3; molecules biologically relevant to signaling pulmonary vascular lesions.\nWe report in the present study that exposure of vascular endothelial cells to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrogenic PCBs induce gene networks implicated in the process of inflammation and adhesion. Our data suggest that PCBs can promote vascular lesion formation by activating gene networks involved in endothelial cell adhesion, cell growth, and pro-inflammatory molecules which were different from natural estrogen. Since inflammation and adhesion are a hallmark in the pathology of endothelial cell dysfunction, reconstructing gene networks provide insight into the potential mechanisms that may contribute to the vascular risks associated with estrogenic environmental chemicals.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2010-04-27", "authors": ["QuentinFelty", "ChangwonYoo", "AmyKennedy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2010.04.007"}

The interplay between vasculogenesis and leucocyte differentiation as well as the population of tumour tissues with ES cell-derived leucocytes and endothelial cells is, however, not sufficiently specified. In the present study, gene expression of the cell surface markers CD68 and CD14 (expressed on monocytes and macrophages), Mac-1 (CD11b) (expressed on granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells) and CD16 (expressed on neutrophils) was investigated in murine CGR8 ES cells in relation to the endothelial cell markers CD31 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Expression of leucocyte markers increased from day 7-8 of cell culture on. Furthermore, addition of macrophage colony-stimulating factor to the cell culture medium resulted in a threefold increase in the number of CD68(+) monocytes/macrophages. Treatment of embryoid bodies with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up-regulated CD14 thus suggesting functionality of the CD14 LPS receptor. Differentiation of vascular structures positive for CD31 and VE-cadherin preceded leucocyte differentiation by 2 days (i.e. from day 5-6 on) suggesting that vasculogenesis may be a determinant of leucocyte differentiation. Consequently the Flk-1 antagonist SU5416 which inhibits vasculogenesis of ES cells significantly blunted leucocyte differentiation. Confrontation culture of embryoid bodies with multicellular breast tumour spheroids initiated significant increase of leucocyte cell numbers and invasion of leucocytes into the tumour tissue. In summary our data demonstrate that during ES cell differentiation vasculogenesis precedes leucocyte differentiation, and point towards the direction that leucocyte cell invasion into tumour tissue may initiate the pro-inflammatory microenvironment necessary for tumour vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2010-04-24", "authors": ["MadeleineHannig", "Hans-ReinerFigulla", "HeinrichSauer", "MariaWartenberg"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00424.x"}

The primary aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of US and the sensitivity for localizing parathyroid glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3). The secondary aim was to assess the parameters that define parathyroid glandular perfusion.\nThe diagnostic use of US was assessed in 40 consecutive uremic patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) who were receiving maintenance hemodialysis or conservative therapy with a hypoproteic-hypophosphoric diet and had undergone parathyroidectomy. Prior to surgery (99m)TC-sestamibi scintigraphy (SM) was performed in all patients.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy of US were 74 %, 75 %, 98 %, and 74 %, respectively. The sensitivity for localizing glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3) was 90 %. US and SM had a combined sensitivity of 83 %. The vascularization of parathyroid glands became more evident with increasing glandular volume. With CDI, the signs of hypervascularization (i. e. an enlarged feeding artery at the hilum, a peripheral arc of vascularity and/or ray-like endonodular vessels) were present in 77 % of glands with a volume \u2265 500 mm(3).\nThe sensitivity of US is higher than that of SM, but it cannot be compared with that of parathyroidectomy (74 vs. 95 %). However, US/CDI is able to characterize glands with different volumes and vascular patterns. Since glandular volume and vascularization are indicative of the severity of sHPT, this study suggests that the main role of US/CDI in the setting of sHPT should be to complete the diagnosis and to evaluate the morphological changes of enlarged glands during uremia in order to define surgical timing, rather than to assess the presurgical location of glands.", "journal": "Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)", "date": "2010-04-24", "authors": ["MMeola", "IPetrucci", "FCalliada", "MBarsotti", "MPuccini", "MGrosso", "GBarsotti"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0029-1245236"}

The results showed that stage IV gastric carcinoma has a higher degree of vascularization than other stages and that both tryptase- and chymase-positive mast cells increase in parallel with malignancy grade even if the density of chymase-positive mast cells was significantly lower than the density of tryptase-positive mast cells and is highly correlated with the extent of angiogenesis.

This capacity of MSCs forms the basis for their use as a gene vector system in neoplasms. Here, we review the tumor-directed migratory potential of MSCs, mechanisms of the migration, and the choice of therapeutic transgenes, with a focus on malignant gliomas as a model system for invasive and highly vascularized tumors. We examine recent findings demonstrating that MSCs share many characteristics with pericytes and that implanted MSCs localize primarily to perivascular niches within tumors, which might have therapeutic implications.

{"title": "Recapitulation of endochondral bone formation using human adult mesenchymal stem cells as a paradigm for developmental engineering.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are typically used to generate bone tissue by a process resembling intramembranous ossification, i.e., by direct osteoblastic differentiation. However, most bones develop by endochondral ossification, i.e., via remodeling of hypertrophic cartilaginous templates. To date, endochondral bone formation has not been reproduced using human, clinically compliant cell sources. Here, we aimed at engineering tissues from bone marrow-derived, adult human MSC with an intrinsic capacity to undergo endochondral ossification. By analogy to embryonic limb development, we hypothesized that successful execution of the endochondral program depends on the initial formation of hypertrophic cartilaginous templates. Human MSC, subcutaneously implanted into nude mice at various stages of chondrogenic differentiation, formed bone trabeculae only when they had developed in vitro hypertrophic tissue structures. Advanced maturation in vitro resulted in accelerated formation of larger bony tissues. The underlying morphogenetic process was structurally and molecularly similar to the temporal and spatial progression of limb bone development in embryos. In particular, Indian hedgehog signaling was activated at early stages and required for the in vitro formation of hypertrophic cartilage. Subsequent development of a bony collar in vivo was followed by vascularization, osteoclastic resorption of the cartilage template, and appearance of hematopoietic foci. This study reveals the capacity of human MSC to generate bone tissue via an endochondral program and provides a valid model to study mechanisms governing bone development. Most importantly, this process could generate advanced grafts for bone regeneration by invoking a \"developmental engineering\" paradigm.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2010-04-22", "authors": ["CelesteScotti", "BeatriceTonnarelli", "AdamPapadimitropoulos", "ArnaudScherberich", "StefanSchaeren", "AlexandraSchauerte", "JavierLopez-Rios", "RolfZeller", "AndreaBarbero", "IvanMartin"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1000302107\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0040009"}
{"title": "A theoretical quantitative model for evolution of cancer chemotherapy resistance.", "abstract": "Disseminated cancer remains a nearly uniformly fatal disease. While a number of effective chemotherapies are available, tumors inevitably evolve resistance to these drugs ultimately resulting in treatment failure and cancer progression. Causes for chemotherapy failure in cancer treatment reside in multiple levels: poor vascularization, hypoxia, intratumoral high interstitial fluid pressure, and phenotypic resistance to drug-induced toxicity through upregulated xenobiotic metabolism or DNA repair mechanisms and silencing of apoptotic pathways. We propose that in order to understand the evolutionary dynamics that allow tumors to develop chemoresistance, a comprehensive quantitative model must be used to describe the interactions of cell resistance mechanisms and tumor microenvironment during chemotherapy.Ultimately, the purpose of this model is to identify the best strategies to treat different types of tumor (tumor microenvironment, genetic/phenotypic tumor heterogeneity, tumor growth rate, etc.). We predict that the most promising strategies are those that are both cytotoxic and apply a selective pressure for a phenotype that is less fit than that of the original cancer population. This strategy, known as double bind, is different from the selection process imposed by standard chemotherapy, which tends to produce a resistant population that simply upregulates xenobiotic metabolism. In order to achieve this goal we propose to simulate different tumor progression and therapy strategies (chemotherapy and glucose restriction) targeting stabilization of tumor size and minimization of chemoresistance.\nThis work confirms the prediction of previous mathematical models and simulations that suggested that administration of chemotherapy with the goal of tumor stabilization instead of eradication would yield better results (longer subject survival) than the use of maximum tolerated doses. Our simulations also indicate that the simultaneous administration of chemotherapy and 2-deoxy-glucose does not optimize treatment outcome because when simultaneously administered these drugs are antagonists. The best results were obtained when 2-deoxy-glucose was followed by chemotherapy in two separate doses.\nThese results suggest that the maximum potential of a combined therapy may depend on how each of the drugs modifies the evolutionary landscape and that a rational use of these properties may prevent or at least delay relapse.\nThis article was reviewed by Dr Marek Kimmel and Dr Mark Little.", "journal": "Biology direct", "date": "2010-04-22", "authors": ["Ariosto SSilva", "Robert AGatenby"], "doi": "10.1186/1745-6150-5-25\n10.1023/A:1013164609041\n10.1186/bcr315\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-2223\n10.1006/mvre.1999.2218\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4462\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3363\n10.1038/459508a\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3658\n10.1007/BF02618247\n10.1021/bi002426w\n10.2967/jnumed.107.047258\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2394\n10.1006/jtbi.2001.2385\n10.1088/0031-9155/39/12/003\n10.1002/jcp.1041510220\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.010\n10.1093/imammb/dqi005\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0343\n10.1073/pnas.68.1.229\n10.1038/sj.onc.1202660\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690617\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604752\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3740\n10.1038/426125a\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3658\n10.1182/blood-2009-07-204651"}

{"title": "Tissue macrophages act as cellular chaperones for vascular anastomosis downstream of VEGF-mediated endothelial tip cell induction.", "abstract": "Blood vessel networks expand in a 2-step process that begins with vessel sprouting and is followed by vessel anastomosis. Vessel sprouting is induced by chemotactic gradients of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates tip cell protrusion. Yet it is not known which factors promote the fusion of neighboring tip cells to add new circuits to the existing vessel network. By combining the analysis of mouse mutants defective in macrophage development or VEGF signaling with live imaging in zebrafish, we now show that macrophages promote tip cell fusion downstream of VEGF-mediated tip cell induction. Macrophages therefore play a hitherto unidentified and unexpected role as vascular fusion cells. Moreover, we show that there are striking molecular similarities between the pro-angiogenic tissue macrophages essential for vascular development and those that promote the angiogenic switch in cancer, including the expression of the cell-surface proteins TIE2 and NRP1. Our findings suggest that tissue macrophages are a target for antiangiogenic therapies, but that they could equally well be exploited to stimulate tissue vascularization in ischemic disease.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2010-04-21", "authors": ["AlessandroFantin", "Joaquim MVieira", "GaiaGestri", "LauraDenti", "QuentenSchwarz", "SergeyPrykhozhij", "FrancescaPeri", "Stephen WWilson", "ChristianaRuhrberg"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-12-257832"}

However, the lack of targeting delivery approaches limits its clinical application. We investigated a collagen based targeting system for bladder regeneration. A collagen binding domain was added to the native basic fibroblast growth factor N-terminal to allow it to bind to collagen.\nSprague-Dawley rats underwent partial cystectomy. Collagen scaffolds loaded with collagen binding domain basic fibroblast growth factor, native basic fibroblast growth factor or phosphate buffered saline were grafted to the remaining host bladders, respectively. At days 30 and 90 reconstructed bladders were evaluated by histological analysis and urodynamics.\nThis targeting basic fibroblast growth factor delivery system induced satisfying bladder histological structures. It promoted more vascularization and smooth muscle cell ingrowth. Urodynamics revealed well accommodated bladder tissue with volume capacity and compliance.\nResults show that the targeting delivery system consisting of collagen binding domain basic fibroblast growth factor and collagen membranes induced better bladder regeneration at the injury site.

Here we examined the molecular basis of disturbed interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) thermogenesis and the possible role of nitric oxide (NO) in the IBAT of diabetic rats. To induce diabetes, adult Mill Hill hybrid hooded male rats were given a single alloxan dose (120 mg/kg). Both non-diabetic and diabetic groups were further divided into three subgroups receiving: (i) L-arginine.HCl (2.25%) or (ii) N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME.HCl, 0.01%) for 12 days in drinking water and (iii) untreated controls. Treatment of the diabetic animals started after diabetes induction (glucose level 12 mmol/L). Diabetes led to a decrease in the mRNA levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) as revealed by RT-PCR. The diabetic rats had reduced eNOS and inducible NOS (iNOS) protein contents accompanied by low tissue vascularization, a parameter directly related to tissue thermogenic state. Downregulation of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) transcripts were also observed in diabetes. In contrast, the expression level of PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA was elevated. Supplementation with L-arginine not only restored diabetes-induced changes in the expressions of these molecules important for IBAT regulation, but also increased the vascularity. Interestingly, L-NAME induced similar patterns of changes in vascularity and PGC-1alpha mRNA level as did l-arginine. In summary, our results provide insight into the molecular basis underlying diabetes-induced metabolic and functional disturbances in the IBAT and suggest a beneficial role for the L-arginine-NO production pathway.", "journal": "Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry", "date": "2010-04-21", "authors": ["AVasilijevi\u0107", "LjVojci\u0107", "IDinulovi\u0107", "BBuzadzi\u0107", "AKora\u0107", "VPetrovi\u0107", "AJankovi\u0107", "BKora\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.niox.2010.04.001"}

{"title": "Sustained release of vancomycin from polyurethane scaffolds inhibits infection of bone wounds in a rat femoral segmental defect model.", "abstract": "Infection is a common complication in open fractures that compromises the healing of bone and can result in loss of limb or life. Currently, the clinical standard of care for treating contaminated open fractures comprises a staged approach, wherein the wound is first treated with non-biodegradable antibiotic-laden poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beads to control the infection followed by bone grafting. Considering that tissue regeneration is associated with new blood vessel formation, which takes up to 6 weeks in segmental defects, a biodegradable bone graft with sustained release of an antibiotic is desired to prevent the implant from becoming infected, thus allowing the processes of both vascularization and new bone formation to occur unimpeded. In the present study, we utilized biodegradable porous polyurethane (PUR) scaffolds as the delivery vehicle for vancomycin. Hydrophobic vancomycin free base (V-FB) was obtained by precipitating the hydrophilic vancomycin hydrochloride (V-HCl) at pH 8. The decreased solubility of V-FB resulted in an extended vancomycin release profile in vitro, as evidenced by the fact that active vancomycin was released for up to 8 weeks at concentrations well above both the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Using PUR prepared from lysine triisocyanate (LTI) (PUR(LTI)), the extended in vitro release profile observed for V-FB translated to improved infection control in vivo compared to V-HCl in a contaminated critical-sized fat femoral segmental defect. The performance of PUR(LTI)/V-FB was comparable to PMMA/V-HCl beads in vivo. However, compared with PMMA, PUR is a biodegradable system which does not require the extra surgical removal step in clinical use. These results suggest that PUR scaffolds incorporating V-FB could be a potential clinical therapy for treatment of infected bone defects.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2010-04-13", "authors": ["BingLi", "Kate VBrown", "Joseph CWenke", "Scott AGuelcher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.04.002"}

Tracheal tumor resection was followed by carinal restitution (n = 3) and interposition of the graft, splinted by a silicone stent. The allograft consisted of an aortic segment, either fresh (in the first 2 patients) or cryopreserved (in the last 4). All grafts were wrapped with bulky and well-vascularized flaps (pectoral muscle flap all patients, with an additional \"thymopericardial fat flap\" in the last 2) to promote revascularization and to prevent erosion of adjacent large vessels or fistulas. No immunosuppressive therapy was administered.\nComplete resection (R0) was achieved in 5 (83%) of 6 patients. Three of the first 4 patients experienced major morbidity, mainly fistulas between the esophagus and graft. The last 2 patients had an uneventful outcome. All grafts transformed into well-vascularized conduits focally lined with respiratory epithelium. So far, the last 4 patients are disease-free and 3 of them have returned to full-time employment. Stent removal has not been attempted in any patient.\nTracheal replacement with aortic allografts enables resection of extensive tumors with a curative intent.

In the control group (group C; n = 20) burns were dressed with Vaseline sterile gauze after normal saline irrigation. In group S (n = 20), the lesions were treated with silver sulfadiazine cream after normal saline irrigation. In the third group (group K; n = 20), the burn wounds were dressed with kiwifruit. The dressings were changed twice a day in all groups. The response to treatments was assessed histologically at day 21 postburn and microbiologically on days 7 and 21. Macroscopic evaluation was performed every day to determine wound closure rate, measure burn wound area, and investigate macroscopic edema, hyperemia, and epithelialization. Histopathologic evaluation included monitoring of epithelialization, vascularization, granulation tissue formation, and inflammatory cell response.\nOn day 21, the wounds in the group K healed completely in comparison to other groups (P < .0001). There was significant reduction in wound area size in the group K in all evaluation days as compared with groups S and C (P < .0001).

In addition, whole blood count (Hb, RBC, WBC, PLT) and body weight were monitored in all animals at each time point. The greatest increase in mucosal capillary regeneration occurred in the early healing period on days 4, 7, 9, and recovery to baseline was achieved by postoperative day 11. Comparisons between preoperative versus postoperative, and prospective mean capillary density measurements on days 2, 4, 7, and 9 were statistically significant (P<0.05).

Some preclinical data suggest that cycling between low and high negative pressure may be more beneficial than continuous NPWT. The purpose of this in vivo study was to compare the effect of intermittent negative pressure (cycled either from 0 to -75 or to -125 mm Hg) and variable negative pressure (cycled from -10 to -75 or -125 mm Hg or from -45 to -75 or -125 mm Hg) on wound edge microvascular blood flow. Using a peripheral wound model (n = 8 domestic 70-kg pigs), intermittent and variable NPWT was applied to surgically created wounds (5 cm diameter, 2 cm depth) for five cycles of 5 minutes of high and 2 minutes of low pressure. Blood flow was measured using laser Doppler velocimetry in subcutaneous and muscle tissue at 0.5 and 2.5 cm from the wound edge. When NPWT was applied, blood flow decreased an average of 29% +/- 2% in muscle tissue and 22 % +/- 4% in subcutaneous tissue at -75 mm Hg at 0.5 cm from the wound edge and increased an average of 20% +/- 6% for -75 mm Hg at 2.5 cm from the wound edge. Blood flow changed repeatedly when negative pressure was cycled. Large gradients between the cycled pressures (eg, -10 to -75 mm Hg) resulted in greater blood flow alterations than smaller (eg, -45 to -75 mm Hg) gradients. Blood flow alternations were similar between low-pressure settings of -10 mm Hg (variable NPWT) and 0 mm Hg (intermittent NPWT) and between high-pressure settings of -75 or -125 mm Hg. Both intermittent and variable NPWT result in a beneficial combination of increased blood flow, known to facilitate oxygenation and nutrient supply, and decreased blood flow, known to stimulate angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation.

{"title": "Distributed self-regulation of living tissue: beyond the ideal limit.", "abstract": "The present paper is devoted to mathematical description of the vascular network response to local perturbations in the cellular tissue state, being one of the basic mechanisms controlling the inner environment of human body. Keeping in mind individual organs we propose a model for distributed self-regulation of living tissue, which is regarded as an active hierarchical system without any controlling center. This model is based on the self-processing of information about the cellular tissue state and cooperative interaction of blood vessels governing redistribution of blood flow over the vascular network. The information self-processing is implemented via mass conservation, i.e., conservation of blood flow as well as special biochemical compounds called activators transported by blood. The cooperative interaction of blood vessels stems from the response of individual vessels to activators in blood flowing through them. The general regularities are used to specify the vessel behavior. The arterial and venous beds are considered to be individually of the tree form. The constructed governing equations are analyzed numerically. In particular, first, we show that the blood perfusion rate approximately (in the analyzed case within 10% accuracy) depends only on the local concentration of activators in the cellular tissue. It is due to the hierarchical structure of the vascular network rather than the ideal behavior of individual vessels accepted previously. Second, we demonstrate the distinction between the reaction thresholds of individual vessels and that of the vascular network as a whole. The latter effect is the cause for introducing the notion of activators instead of using such quantities as temperature in describing the living tissue self-regulation.", "journal": "Physical review.

Group 1 (Control Group): No radiation or drugs were administered. Group 2 (Radiation Group): only radiation was applied without any drugs. Group 3 (Halofuginone Group): halofuginone 100 microg/kg per day was given intraperitoneally. Group 4 (Methylprednisolone Group): methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day was administered intramuscularly. In all groups, 90 days after application of radiation, sections of the proximal esophagus and hypopharynx were examined for fibrosis, fibroblast proliferation, vascularization, epithelial atypia, necrosis, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear cells, and stenosis index by light microscope and the hydroxyproline levels were assessed biochemically. Fibrosis, epithelial atypia and hydroxyproline levels were found to be significantly higher in the radiation group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). We did not observe fibrosis in either the halofuginone or the control groups. Fibrosis was also significantly lower in the methylprednisolone group than the radiation group (P < 0.05). The differences of the stenosis index scores between the groups were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). Vascularization was similar in all groups.

Also, extreme hypoxia plays main role in pathological studies of cardiac dysfunction. The morphological and physiological developmental studies of the cardiovascular system under low oxygen are important as it is directly related to oxygen supply and consumption. Furthermore, cardiac function demands high energy during system development and thus it is most likely to be affected by hypoxia. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) can act as a model organism for oxygen demand management study as in natural environment, due to ecological disturbances, it is exposed to changes in oxygen concentrations routinely and thus would have natural ability to cope with it for survival. We have studied, in zebrafish, i) cardiovascular flexibility under extreme hypoxia (PO(2)=20 Torr, 3 kPa) at 3-10 dpf (days post-fertilization), ii) cardiac re-animation in normoxia (PO(2)=152 Torr, 20 kPa) after 90 min of anoxia (PO(2)=0 Torr, 0 kPa)-induced suspended animation at 4 dpf and iii) oxygen consumption in 8 dpf von Hippel-Lindau (vhl(-)(/)(-)) mutant that exhibits an artificial hypoxic response under normoxic conditions. In hypoxic fish, cardiac output, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume were elevated while intersegmental blood vessels vascularization index at 6 dpf and at 10 dpf was 22% and 11% higher respectively as compared to the normoxic fish. The heart rate in hypoxic fish was lower until 6 dpf and then showed an elevated trend. There was no significant difference in body length between the hypoxic and normoxic individuals. The observed changes may have enhanced the performance of the cardiovascular system for oxygen uptake. We also report for the first time that the post-anoxia re-animated heart rate returns to normal after 48h.

The relationship between the volume of the vascularized graft and the extent of tolerance induced to it remains unclear and needs further investigation. Adult male Fischer and Rowett nude rats (8-10 weeks old, 200-250 g) were used as donors and recipients of allogeneic thymus grafts. Rowett nude rats were randomly divided into three groups: Group A, sham-grafted controls (n=5); Group B, recipients of whole thymus (including two thymic lobes) (n=10); Group C, recipients of one thymic lobe (n=8). The animal body weight and survival were monitored postoperatively. Histological examination was used to monitor graft survival. Graft function and tolerance induction were assessed by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), flow cytometry (FCM), and full-thickness skin graft studies. All animals survived. After 16 weeks, the vessels supplying blood to the thymus graft were patent and histologically the grafts had normal corticomedullary architecture. Body weight increased to the greatest extent in Group B (p<0.05). After 5 weeks, FCM showed that the percentage of CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood was higher in Group B than Group C (p<0.05). MLR and skin graft studies showed that the thymus grafts had re-established a peripheral blood T lymphocyte function in Groups B and C and induced low donor-specific immune responses. Skin allografts had survived 2-3 days longer in Group B than in Group C. Additionally, the lymphocyte reaction to the donor was lower in Group B than Group C (15.1% vs 20.5%), but the lymphocyte reaction to third-party cell stimulation was stronger in Group B than Group C (94.4% vs 22.1%).

Features include severe intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), poor postnatal growth (adult stature approximately 100 cm), severe microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, characteristic facial features, and normal or near normal intelligence. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved registry was created and currently follows 25 patients with a diagnosis of MOPD II. Based on previous studies, a neurovascular screening program was implemented and 13 (52%) of these patients have been found to have cerebral neurovascular abnormalities including moyamoya angiopathy and/or intracranial aneurysms. The typical moyamoya pathogenesis begins with vessel narrowing in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral (A1) or middle cerebral (M1) artery segments. The narrowing may predominate initially on one side, progresses to bilateral stenosis, with subsequent occlusion of the vessels and collateral formation. We present four patients who, on neurovascular screening, were found to have cerebrovascular changes. Two were asymptomatic, one presented with a severe headache and projectile vomiting related to a ruptured aneurysm, and one presented after an apparent decline in cognitive functioning. Analysis of the registry suggests screening for moyamoya disease be performed at the time of MOPD II diagnosis and at least every 12-18 months using MRA or computerized tomographic angiography (CTA). We believe this is imperative. If diagnosed early enough, re-vascularization and aneurysm treatment in skilled hands can be performed safely and prevent or minimize long-term sequelae in this population.

Elimination constant was calculated based on the dynamics of cisplatin concentration in time period between 1 h to 24 h using nonlinear regression analysis. Area under curve (AUC24) was calculated by the trapezium method.\nIt was shown that for liposomal form of cisplatin (LCp) AUC24 in tumor practically didn't depend on the level of the tumor sensitivity, while in animals with the resistant variant (CpRGC), AUC24 for free cisplatin (FCp) decreased by 70% less (p < 0.001) as compared to the sensitive tumor strain (CpSGC). Significant decrease of elimination constant of LCp compared to FCp in blood serum of rats bearing either CpRGC or CpSGC tumors favors cisplatin accumulation in tumor tissues with low vascularization level. The dynamics of cisplatin concentration in CpRGC variant was characterized by 90% higher level in 24 h after administration of LCp as compared to FCp (p < 0.05). This fact may explain increased antitumor efficacy of LCp compared to FCp toward CpRGC variant.

Some Practical Considerations on the Pre-Operative Identification of this Artery Starting from a Single Team Experience in Pre-Surgical Selective Embolization of Vascularized Spinal Lesions.", "abstract": "The major radicular artery eponymically named \"Adamkiewicz's artery\" (AKA) is an important vessel supplying the spinal cord, especially the lumbar enlargement. This report emphasizes the importance of anatomical knowledge of this artery and highlights the concept of the potential risk of neurological complications during different procedures: spine orthopedic/neurosurgery, aortic repair (vascular surgery) and endovascular selective embolizations performed by interventional neuro/radiologists. Anatomical considerations are made on the spinal cord arterial circulation with a special focus on the AKA. Our review of the literature considered this anatomical element essential to compare the potential risk of spinal cord ischemic damage during orthopedic/neurosurgical spine procedures, aortic vascular surgery repair procedures and endovascular selective arterial embolizations. Evaluation of the endovascular selective arterial spine embolization risk was based on our series of 410 embolization procedures. Spinal cord infarction and transient or permanent paraplegia may result from inadvertent interruption of the AKA. The presence of intersegmental collaterals may decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemia: this is an important element to bear in mind that may help in spine surgery or aortic repair procedures performed by vascular surgeons. Nevertheless, during aortic repair (open surgery or stent-graft procedures) interruption of bilateral segmental arteries at multiple consecutive levels including that of the AKA may occur thereby increasing the ischemic spinal cord risk, annulling the benefit of intersegmental collaterals. Accidental embolizations of the AKA during endovascular spine procedures (i.e. selective arterial embolizations) performed by interventional neuro/radiologists will cause an almost certain spinal cord infarction due to the consequent embolizations of the anterior spinal artery (ASA).", "journal": "The neuroradiology journal", "date": "2010-04-01", "authors": ["AStafa", "CBarbara", "SBoriani", "LSimonetti", "MLeonardi"], "doi": "10.1177/197140091002300213"}
{"title": "Multiple roles for CCR2 during fracture healing.", "abstract": "Bone injury induces an inflammatory response that involves neutrophils, macrophages and other inflammatory cells. The recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of injury occurs in response to specific signaling pathways. The CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) is crucial for recruiting macrophages, as well as regulating osteoclast function. In this study, we examined fracture healing in Ccr2-/- mice. We first demonstrated that the expression of Ccr2 transcripts and the filtration of macrophages into fracture calluses were most robust during the early phases of fracture healing. We then determined that the number of macrophages at the fracture site was significantly lower in Ccr2-/- mice compared with wild-type controls at 3 days after injury. As a result, impaired vascularization, decreased formation of callus, and delayed maturation of cartilage were observed at 7 days after injury in mutant mice. At day 14, Ccr2-/- mice had less bone in their calluses. At day 21, Ccr2-/- mice had larger calluses and more bone compared with wild-type mice, suggesting a delayed remodeling. In addition, we examined the effect of Ccr2 mutation on osteoclasts. We found that a lack of Ccr2 did not affect the number of osteoclasts within fracture calluses at 21 days after injury. However, Ccr2-/- osteoclasts exhibited a decreased ability to resorb bone compared with wild-type cells, which could contribute to the delayed remodeling of fracture calluses observed in Ccr2-/- mice. Collectively, these results indicate that a deficiency of Ccr2 reduces the infiltration of macrophages and impairs the function of osteoclasts, leading to delayed fracture healing.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2010-04-01", "authors": ["ZhiqingXing", "ChuanyongLu", "DianeHu", "Yan-yiuYu", "XiaodongWang", "CelineColnot", "MaryNakamura", "YaleiWu", "TheodoreMiclau", "Ralph SMarcucio"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.003186"}

We directly compared the reactions of ADSCs and BMDSCs to hypoxic and inflammatory conditions in vitro. Cultured ADSCs and BMDSCs from Balb/c mice were cultivated for 48 h under 1% O2 (hypoxia), 20% O2 (normoxia) or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. Cell viability analyzed by annexin V-PE binding and 7AAD storage (flow cytometry), and by quantitative TUNEL showed no decrease under hypoxic condition. But cell apoptotic rates significantly increased (up to 70 %) under inflammatory condition. Inflammatory cytokines did not stimulate gene expression of angiogenic growth factors. Otherwise, gene expression profiles of angiogenesis-related cytokines showed activation of pro-angiogenic and suppression of anti-angiogenic factors in the cells under hypoxic condition. In general this effect was higher for ADSCs than for BMDSCs.

{"title": "Predicting effects of blood flow rate and size of vessels in a vasculature on hyperthermia treatments using computer simulation.", "abstract": "Pennes Bio Heat Transfer Equation (PBHTE) has been widely used to approximate the overall temperature distribution in tissue using a perfusion parameter term in the equation during hyperthermia treatment. In the similar modeling, effective thermal conductivity (Keff) model uses thermal conductivity as a parameter to predict temperatures. However the equations do not describe the thermal contribution of blood vessels. A countercurrent vascular network model which represents a more fundamental approach to modeling temperatures in tissue than do the generally used approximate equations such as the Pennes BHTE or effective thermal conductivity equations was presented in 1996. This type of model is capable of calculating the blood temperature in vessels and describing a vasculature in the tissue regions.\nIn this paper, a countercurrent blood vessel network (CBVN) model for calculating tissue temperatures has been developed for studying hyperthermia cancer treatment. We use a systematic approach to reveal the impact of a vasculature of blood vessels against a single vessel which most studies have presented. A vasculature illustrates branching vessels at the periphery of the tumor volume. The general trends present in this vascular model are similar to those shown for physiological systems in Green and Whitmore. The 3-D temperature distributions are obtained by solving the conduction equation in the tissue and the convective energy equation with specified Nusselt number in the vessels.\nThis paper investigates effects of size of blood vessels in the CBVN model on total absorbed power in the treated region and blood flow rates (or perfusion rate) in the CBVN on temperature distributions during hyperthermia cancer treatment. Also, the same optimized power distribution during hyperthermia treatment is used to illustrate the differences between PBHTE and CBVN models. Keff (effective thermal conductivity model) delivers the same difference as compared to the CBVN model. The optimization used here is adjusting power based on the local temperature in the treated region in an attempt to reach the ideal therapeutic temperature of 43 degrees C. The scheme can be used (or adapted) in a non-invasive power supply application such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Results show that, for low perfusion rates in CBVN model vessels, impacts on tissue temperature becomes insignificant. Uniform temperature in the treated region is obtained.\nTherefore, any method that could decrease or prevent blood flow rates into the tumorous region is recommended as a pre-process to hyperthermia cancer treatment. Second, the size of vessels in vasculatures does not significantly affect on total power consumption during hyperthermia therapy when the total blood flow rate is constant. It is about 0.8% decreasing in total optimized absorbed power in the heated region as gamma (the ratio of diameters of successive vessel generations) increases from 0.6 to 0.7, or from 0.7 to 0.8, or from 0.8 to 0.9. Last, in hyperthermia treatments, when the heated region consists of thermally significant vessels, much of absorbed power is required to heat the region and (provided that finer spatial power deposition exists) to heat vessels which could lead to higher blood temperatures than tissue temperatures when modeled them using PBHTE.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2010-03-30", "authors": ["Huang-WenHuang", "Tzu-ChingShih", "Chihng-TsungLiauh"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-9-18\n10.1016/S0169-409X(02)00041-8\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.002\n10.1016/j.ejca.2009.03.009\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1980.tb50742.x\n10.1088/0031-9155/29/5/002\n10.1115/1.3138533\n10.1115/1.3138502\n10.1115/1.3138205\n10.1115/1.2895721\n10.1115/1.2891173\n10.1115/1.3138610\n10.1115/1.3138623\n10.1115/1.3138609\n10.1115/1.3108442\n10.1115/1.2894097\n10.1088/0031-9155/35/7/007\n10.1115/1.2895728\n10.1088/0031-9155/45/4/317\n10.1115/1.2795937\n10.1115/1.2165693\n10.1115/1.2895804\n10.1115/1.2895458\n10.1118/1.2712415"}

Among the plethora of roles that Wnt signaling plays, its canonical branch regulates eye organogenesis and angiogenesis. Mutations in the genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor protein 5 (LRP5) and frizzled 4 (FZD4), acting as coreceptors for Wnt ligands, cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). Moreover, mutations in the gene encoding NDP, a ligand for these Wnt receptors, cause Norrie disease and FEVR. Both FEVR and Norrie disease share similar phenotypic characteristics, including abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina and formation of fibrovascular masses in the eye that can lead to blindness. In this mutation update, we report 21 novel variants for FZD4, LRP5, and NDP, and discuss the putative functional consequences of missense mutations. In addition, we provide a comprehensive overview of all previously published variants in the aforementioned genes and summarize the phenotypic characteristics in mouse models carrying mutations in the orthologous genes.

The samples were colored by using standard histochemical methods: hematoxylin-eosin (HE), trichrome Masson painting, Gomora reticulin and PAS technique.\nPterygium was mostly covered by epithelium resembling conjunctival, while in the frontal cap region it showed the morphology of plate-layer cornea epithelium. The structural basis of the epithelium was composed of continuous basal lamina and continuous adhesive fibres underneath. This adhesive basis showed fibrinoid changes in the form of oval islands of various size, parallel to convexity of pterygium, or in the form of unified focus. The number, caliber and type of blood vessels showed a pronounced variability. Duration of pterygium and its size were in negative correlation with intensity of inflammation, without statistical significance. Pterygium with a longer period of develepment had negative correlation with the degree of vascularization (p > 0.05). The presence of Fuchs' spots showed a statitistically significant positive correlation with the degree of vascularization (p < 0.05). The intensity of fibrinoid changes was higher in pterygium with Fuchs' spots and in those which recurred (p > 0.05).\nHistopathological analysis of pterygium morphological shapes is a good basis for the prediction of recidives, which present the greatest problem in the treatment of this widely spread disease.", "journal": "Vojnosanitetski pregled", "date": "2010-03-27", "authors": ["BobanDzuni\u0107", "PredragJovanovi\u0107", "GordanaZlatanovi\u0107", "DraganVeselinovi\u0107", "AleksandarPetrovi\u0107", "IvanStefanovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.2298/vsp1002159d"}

We show that zebrafish vhl mutants display a marked increase in blood vessel formation throughout the embryo, starting at 2 days post-fertilization. The most severe neovascularization is observed in distinct areas that overlap with high vegfa mRNA expression, including the vhl mutant brain and eye. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed increased expression of the duplicated VEGFA orthologs vegfaa and vegfab, and of vegfb and its receptors flt1, kdr and kdr-like, indicating increased vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) signaling in vhl mutants. Similar to VHL-associated retinal neoplasms, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, we show, by tetramethyl rhodamine-dextran angiography, that vascular abnormalities in the vhl(-/-) retina lead to vascular leakage, severe macular edema and retinal detachment. Significantly, vessels in the brain and eye express cxcr4a, a marker gene expressed by tumor and vascular cells in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinomas. VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibition (through exposure to sunitinib and 676475) blocked vhl(-/-)-induced angiogenesis in all affected tissues, demonstrating that Vegfaa, Vegfab and Vegfb are key effectors of the vhl(-/-) angiogenic phenotype through Flt1, Kdr and Kdr-like signaling. Since we show that the vhl(-/-) angiogenic phenotype shares distinct characteristics with VHL-associated vascular neoplasms, zebrafish vhl mutants provide a valuable in vivo vertebrate model to elucidate underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of these lesions. Furthermore, vhl mutant zebrafish embryos carrying blood vessel-specific transgenes represent a unique and clinically relevant model for tissue-specific, hypoxia-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular retinopathies.

{"title": "Tumor rejection by local interferon gamma induction in established tumors is associated with blood vessel destruction and necrosis.", "abstract": "It has been shown that injecting a suspension of IFN-\u03b3-secreting tumor cells results in their rejection. This effect has been attributed to IFN-\u03b3 preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells. However, it is not known, which influence IFN-\u03b3 has on tumors with an established stroma. To address this question, the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-\u03b3 gene expression. After the injection of the tumor cells into mice, IFN-\u03b3 was induced at different time points. Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-\u03b3 immediately after tumor cell inoculation, while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-\u03b3 was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks. Induction of IFN-\u03b3 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient (0-17% rejection). IFN-\u03b3 induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis. Together, we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-\u03b3 expression, but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time. This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-\u03b3 treatment the better they are established.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2010-03-25", "authors": ["DanaBriesemeister", "DanielSommermeyer", "ChristophLoddenkemper", "RainerLoew", "WolfgangUckert", "ThomasBlankenstein", "ThomasKammertoens"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.25350"}
{"title": "Modified technique for thoracomyoplasty after posterolateral thoracotomy.", "abstract": "Thoracomyoplasty after prior posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT) remains a challenge for the thoracic surgeon. Thoracodorsal artery division after PLT impairs the vascularization supply of the latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) resulting in muscle mass reduction due to distal atrophy. This makes adequate filling of residual empyema space and/or surgical closure of bronchial stump insufficiency more difficult, and they require alternative surgical procedures. We present an alternative approach using a four-muscle flap technique to include the infraspinatus, the subscapularis and the teres major muscle group, all pedicled from the subscapular artery as a part of a modified thoracomyoplasty technique for closing residual empyema space and bronchial stump insufficiency.\nBetween 2002 and 2008 we performed the technique in 7 patients with residual empyema space. Three patients had post-tuberculosis syndrome, 2 had postpneumectomy empyema, and 2 had chronic parapneumonic empyema. Three cases were combined with a bronchopleural fistula. All patients underwent a two-stage procedure. First, open window thoracostomy was performed followed by definitive surgical treatment after 3-6 months. In all cases with bronchial insufficiency the stump was covered with a subscapularis muscle flap. The infraspinatus and the teres muscle group were used in combination with a local thoracoplasty.\nMean age was 68 +/- 7.9 years. Time from open window thoracostomy to thoracomyoplasty averaged 4 +/- 1.3 months. The number of resected ribs ranged between 4 and 8. Mean postoperative stay in the ICU was 3 +/- 2.9 days. The thoracic drains were removed after 5 +/- 2.3 days. Total hospital stay was 15 +/- 7.6 days. No hospital mortality was noted. Minor postoperative complications occurred in 2 cases. Shoulder function without pain allowed abduction up to 90 degrees. Function was decreased by 16 +/- 9 degrees compared to preoperative evaluation. No severe progressive scoliosis was noted.\nDivision of the LDM and its vascular supply after posterolateral thoracotomy results in a reduction of muscle mass. The shoulder girdle muscles offer an adequate alternative to fill residual empyema space with acceptable long-term results and restriction in shoulder motion.

Endometrial fragments and ovarian follicles were transplanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of hamsters, which were treated with genistein (50 and 200 mg/kg) or vehicle (control). Vascularization and blood perfusion of the grafts was analyzed over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy and histology. Genistein inhibited angiogenesis neither in endometriotic lesions nor in ovarian follicles. This was indicated by a final microvessel density of the grafts, which was comparable to that of controls. Blood perfusion was not affected by genistein treatment. At day 14 after transplantation, the grafts of genistein- and vehicle-treated animals exhibited a histomorphology, which was typical for well-vascularized endometriotic lesions and ovarian follicles without any signs of regression.

Here we exploited image guided surgery to sample multiple intratumoral areas to define potential cellular heterogeneity in correlation to the oxygen tension gradient within the GBM mass. Our results indicate that more immature cells are localized in the inner core and in the intermediate layer of the tumor mass, whereas more committed cells, expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and beta-III-tubulin, are distributed along the peripheral and neo-vascularized area, where Smad1/5/8 and Stat3 result to be activated. Moreover, GBM stem cells, identified with the stem cell marker CD133, express high level of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) known to be involved in chemotherapy resistance and highly expressed in the inner core of the tumor mass. Importantly, these cells and, particularly, CD133(+) cells result to be resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), the most used oral alkylating agent for the treatment of GBM, which specifically causes apoptosis only in GBM cells derived from the peripheral layer of the tumor mass. These results indicate a correlation between the intratumoral hypoxic gradient, the tumor cell phenotype, and the tumor resistance to chemotherapy leading to a novel concentric model of tumor stem cell niche, which may be useful to define the real localization of the chemoresistant GBM tumor cells in order to design more effective treatment strategies.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2010-03-24", "authors": ["FrancescaPistollato", "SaraAbbadi", "ElenaRampazzo", "LucaPersano", "AlessandroDella Puppa", "ChiaraFrasson", "EvaSarto", "RenatoScienza", "DomenicoD'avella", "GiuseppeBasso"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.415"}

{"title": "The role of disc-type crystal shape for micromechanical predictions of elasticity and strength of hydroxyapatite biomaterials.", "abstract": "The successful design of ceramic bone biomaterials is challenged by two competing requirements: on the one hand, such materials need to be stiff and strong, which would suggest a low porosity (of pore sizes in the 10-100 microm range) to be targeted; on the other hand, bone biomaterials need to be bioactive (in particular vascularized), which suggests a high porosity of such materials. Conclusively, reliable information on how porosity drives the stiffness and strength properties of ceramic bone biomaterials (tissue engineering scaffolds) is of great interest. In this context, mathematical models are increasingly being introduced into the field. Recently, self-consistent continuum micromechanics formulations have turned out as expressedly efficient and reliable tools to predict hydroxyapatite biomaterials' stiffness and strength, as a function of the biomaterial-specific porosity, and of the 'universal' properties of the individual hydroxyapatite crystals: their stiffness, strength and shape. However, the precise crystal shape can be suitably approximated by specific ellipsoidal shapes: while it was shown earlier that spherical shapes do not lead to satisfactory results, and that acicular shapes are an appropriate choice, we here concentrate on disc-type crystal shape as, besides needles, plates are often reported in micrographs of hydroxyapatite biomaterials. Disc-based model predictions of a substantial set of experimental data on stiffness and strength of hydroxyapatite biomaterials almost attain the quality of the very satisfactory needle-based models. This suggests that, as long as the crystal shape is clearly non-spherical, its precise shape is of secondary importance if stiffness and strength of hydroxyapatite biomaterials are predicted on the basis of continuum micromechanics, from their micromorphology and porosity.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

Cyclic AMP-elevating agents promoted vascular stability and barrier function, and reduced cellular turnover. Under conditions that induced the highest levels of cAMP, the physiology of engineered microvessels in vitro quantitatively mirrored that of native vessels in vivo.

The disease is unilateral in most cases but can exceptionally involve both sides of the face. Progressive deformation of the orbital frame due to the expanding plexiform neurofibroma and buphthalmos occurs in a large proportion of cases. The associated sphenoidal dysplasia, which is thought to be, according to the most recent hypothesis, genetically determined, will inescapably increase the burden to the orbital content, cause pulsating proptosis and will endanger noble structures, finally resulting in loss of vision. Using the Jackson classification, the authors report their personal series of 22 cases (19 operated). Until now, there has been no effective medical treatment for plexiform neurofibroma and surgery remains the standard care for these patients. Controversies remain about the timing of the first operation and today most multidisciplinary teams involving plastic, maxillofacial, ophthalmologic, and neurosurgeons favor early intervention to try to minimize the secondary deformation of the orbital and facial skeleton.

{"title": "[Incisional hernia - how do I do it? Standard surgical approach].", "abstract": "Various techniques for repair of an incisional hernia are available for the surgeon. Conventional suture techniques are quick and easy to perform but they are associated with an unacceptable rate of recurrence and therefore should only be used in exceptional cases. An underlying systemic disturbance of collagen metabolism is assumed to exist in patients with an incisional hernia. In such patients the mechanisms of wound healing and remodeling of the abdominal wall following laparotomy are insufficient, which necessitates reinforcement of the abdominal wall with a non-resorbable alloplastic mesh prosthesis to enable a long-term cure. The implantation of such meshes can be carried out laparoscopically or by an open approach. The gold standard of open repair techniques is the retromuscular placement of a mesh prosthesis. The retromuscular mesh placement as a reinforcement of the abdominal wall (augmentation) must be categorically differentiated into the abdominal wall replacement by mesh bridging. In this technique the mesh is likewise placed in the retromuscular space, however a complete closure of the ventral fascia is not necessary. Retromuscular augmentation enables an extra-peritoneal placement of the prosthesis, an optimization of tissue integration by plane coverage of the prosthesis by well vascularized muscular tissue and a sufficient overlap in cranio-caudal and lateral directions. Mesh fixation is best made with absorbable suture material but is better suited for technical simplification. The use of a prophylactic drainage should be decided depending on the individual patient's risk factors, because sufficient evidence-based data are currently not available. If augmentation is not possible bridging is necessary and then the mesh has to be fixed without underlying support. Current data reveal that the recurrence rate following incisional hernia repair by retromuscular mesh augmentation has decreased promisingly in comparison to simple suture techniques. In total the recurrence rate following retromuscular mesh placement ranges between 2 and 12%. Current results of prospective randomized multicentre trials are not available. However, it is to be expected that further development of mesh materials as well as improvement of surgical techniques with avoidance of typical pitfalls will lead to further reduction of the recurrence rate with an improvement in patient satisfaction.", "journal": "Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen", "date": "2010-03-20", "authors": ["JConze", "MBinneb\u00f6sel", "KJunge", "VSchumpelick"], "doi": "10.1007/s00104-009-1817-6"}

{"title": "Neutrophils responsive to endogenous IFN-beta regulate tumor angiogenesis and growth in a mouse tumor model.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a hallmark of malignant neoplasias, as the formation of new blood vessels is required for tumors to acquire oxygen and nutrients essential for their continued growth and metastasis. However, the signaling pathways leading to tumor vascularization are not fully understood. Here, using a transplantable mouse tumor model, we have demonstrated that endogenous IFN-beta inhibits tumor angiogenesis through repression of genes encoding proangiogenic and homing factors in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils. We determined that IFN-beta-deficient mice injected with B16F10 melanoma or MCA205 fibrosarcoma cells developed faster-growing tumors with better-developed blood vessels than did syngeneic control mice. These tumors displayed enhanced infiltration by CD11b+Gr1+ neutrophils expressing elevated levels of the genes encoding the proangiogenic factors VEGF and MMP9 and the homing receptor CXCR4. They also expressed higher levels of the transcription factors c-myc and STAT3, known regulators of VEGF, MMP9, and CXCR4. In vitro, treatment of these tumor-infiltrating neutrophils with low levels of IFN-beta restored expression of proangiogenic factors to control levels. Moreover, depletion of these neutrophils inhibited tumor growth in both control and IFN-beta-deficient mice. We therefore suggest that constitutively produced endogenous IFN-beta is an important mediator of innate tumor surveillance. Further, we believe our data help to explain the therapeutic effect of IFN treatment during the early stages of cancer development.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2010-03-20", "authors": ["JadwigaJablonska", "SaraLeschner", "KathrinWestphal", "StefanLienenklaus", "SiegfriedWeiss"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI37223\n10.1111/j.1750-3639.1994.tb00835.x\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.11.006\n10.1038/nm0195-27\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2427\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.07.003\n10.1084/jem.181.1.435\n10.1073/pnas.0601807103\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.09.004\n10.1096/fj.05-5137fje\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2003.10.003\n10.1023/B:NEON.0000024241.05346.24\n10.1002/ijc.22024\n10.1093/brain/awl173\n10.1038/416744a\n10.1128/JVI.01718-06\n10.1038/nri1961\n10.1128/JVI.74.7.3404-3409.2000\n10.1073/pnas.95.24.14411\n10.1038/sj.gt.3300509\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00223.x\n10.1084/jem.20080421\n10.1084/jem.193.6.727\n10.1038/nrc1256\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3473\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.08.031\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.034\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.1038/nm1101-1194\n10.1073/pnas.81.6.1747\n10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.002\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401829\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208314\n10.1128/MCB.24.21.9390-9400.2004\n10.1182/blood-2004-12-4918\n10.1016/S1471-4906(02)02195-6\n10.1038/nri1703\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80165-X\n10.1038/sj.icb.7100082\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.193268\n10.1189/jlb.0605337\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3452\n10.1128/IAI.72.7.3823-3828.2004\n10.1073/pnas.2230460100\n10.1016/S1359-6101(01)00035-1\n10.1634/theoncologist.6-1-34\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00754-7\n10.1038/35073080\n10.1056/NEJMoa035611\n10.1056/NEJMoa035471"}

Subcutaneous Lewis Lung carcinomas (LLC-1) carcinomas were established in mice. A-MEL-3 melanomas were grown in dorsal skinfold chambers of hamsters to permit bimodal imaging of tumor microcirculation by CEUS and IVM. Animals were treated by i.p. injection of ZD6126 and CEUS imaging after bolus injection of microbubbles was performed. Red blood cell velocity (VRBC), segmental blood flow (Q) and microcirculatory perfusion (PI) of tumors was quantified by IVM. Change in signal intensity (SI) from baseline (\u0394SI), rate of SI increase (RSI) and area below intensity time curves (AUC) were calculated in tumors by analysis of CEUS data. Microvessel density was measured by quantitative analysis of CD31 immunohistochemistry. The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate differences between groups. Spearman correlation test was used to investigate the relation between CEUS and IVM parameters or histologic CD31 count. \u0394SI, RSI and AUC values in ZD6126 treated tumors were lower compared to untreated controls. Comparing central and peripheral tumor regions a vascularized viable rim in the tumor periphery could be detected by CEUS imaging. For the entire cohort \u0394SI, RSI and AUC values positively correlated with VRBC, Q and PI quantified by IVM. In LLC-1 carcinomas a positive correlation between \u0394SI, RSI and AUC and histological assessment of tumor vascularity was found. In conclusion tumor vascular response to vascular targeting therapy can be quantified non-invasively by CEUS.

Considering the recognized importance of PAI-1 in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and invasion in murine models of skin tumor transplantation, we explored the functional significance of PAI-1 during early stages of neoplastic progression in the transgenic mouse model of multistage epithelial carcinogenesis (K14-HPV16 mice). We have studied the effect of genetic deletion of PAI-1 on inflammation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and tumor progression. In this model, PAI-1 deficiency neither impaired keratinocyte hyperproliferation or tumor development nor affected the infiltration of inflammatory cells and development of angiogenic or lymphangiogenic vasculature. We are reporting evidence for concomitant lymphangiogenic and angiogenic switches independent to PAI-1 status. Taken together, these data indicate that PAI-1 is not rate limiting for neoplastic progression and vascularization during premalignant progression, or that there is a functional redundancy between PAI-1 and other tumor regulators, masking the effect of PAI-1 deficiency in this long-term model of multistage epithelial carcinogenesis.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2010-03-17", "authors": ["AnneMasset", "CatherineMaillard", "Nor EddineSounni", "NathalieJacobs", "Fran\u00e7oiseBruy\u00e9re", "PhilippeDelvenne", "MarleneTacke", "ThomasReinheckel", "Jean-MichelFoidart", "Lisa MCoussens", "Agn\u00e8sNo\u00ebl"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.25326"}
{"title": "Arctigenin blocks the unfolded protein response and shows therapeutic antitumor activity.", "abstract": "Cancer cells in poorly vascularized solid tumors are constantly or intermittently exposed to stressful microenvironments, including glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and other forms of nutrient starvation. These tumor-specific conditions, especially glucose deprivation, activate a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which enhances cell survival by induction of the stress proteins. We have established a screening method to discover anticancer agents that could preferentially inhibit tumor cell viability under glucose-deprived conditions. Here we identify arctigenin (ARC-G) as an active compound that shows selective cytotoxicity and inhibits the UPR during glucose deprivation. Indeed, ARC-G blocked expression of UPR target genes such as phosphorylated-PERK, ATF4, CHOP, and GRP78, which was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha during glucose deprivation. The UPR inhibition led to apoptosis involving a mitochondrial pathway by activation of caspase-9 and -3. Furthermore, ARC-G suppressed tumor growth of colon cancer HT-29 xenografts.

To study the structural and cellular differences in both diaphyseal and metaphyseal periosteum of osteoporotic rats, samples from the right femur of osteoporotic and normal female Lewis rats were collected and tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, antibodies or staining kit against tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand (vWF), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The results showed that the osteoporotic rats had much thicker and more cellular cambial layer of metaphyseal periosteum compared with other periosteal areas and normal rats (P < 0.001). The number of TRAP(+) osteoclasts in bone resorption pits, VEGF(+) cells and the degree of vascularization were found to be greater in the cambial layer of metaphyseal periosteum of osteoporotic rats (P < 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in the number of ALP(+) cells between the two groups. Sympathetic nerve fibers identified by TH staining were predominantly located in the cambial layer of metaphyseal periosteum of osteoporotic rats. No obvious difference in the expression of CGRP between the two groups was found.

To verify this hypothesis, wild type (WT) mice were studied 3 and 8 weeks after aortic stenosis, created by banding the ascending aorta in WT and MMP-9-/- (MMP-9KO) mice.

The molecular mechanisms underlying SSc vasculopathy are largely unknown. Friend leukemia integration factor 1 (Fli1), an important regulator of immune function and collagen fibrillogenesis, is expressed at reduced levels in endothelial cells in affected skin of patients with SSc. To develop a disease model and to investigate the function of Fli1 in the vasculature, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Fli1 in endothelial cells (Fli1 CKO). Fli1 CKO mice showed a disorganized dermal vascular network with greatly compromised vessel integrity and markedly increased vessel permeability. We show that Fli1 regulates expression of genes involved in maintaining vascular homeostasis including VE-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, type IV collagen, matrix metalloproteinase 9, platelet-derived growth factor B, and S1P(1) receptor. Accordingly, Fli1 CKO mice are characterized by down-regulation of VE-cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, impaired development of basement membrane, and a decreased presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in dermal microvessels. This phenotype is consistent with a role of Fli1 as a regulator of vessel maturation and stabilization. Importantly, vascular characteristics of Fli1 CKO mice are recapitulated by SSc microvasculature. Thus, persistently reduced levels of Fli1 in endothelial cells may play a critical role in the development of SSc vasculopathy.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2010-03-17", "authors": ["YoshihideAsano", "LukaszStawski", "FayeHant", "KristinHighland", "RichardSilver", "GaborSzalai", "Dennis KWatson", "MariaTrojanowska"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2010.090593"}

However, anorectal mucosal melanoma is a rare neoplasm, usually occurring in the sixth and seventh decades of life. It may often be confused clinically with other pathologic entities, such as prolapsed rectal polyps and hemorrhoids. The prognosis of anorectal melanoma is poor; this is at least in part attributable to the relatively large size that such tumors have frequently achieved at presentation, as well as their rich vascular network. In particular, anorectal melanoma in children and adolescents is extraordinarily uncommon.

{"title": "[Ultrasonographic findings validity in the identification of metastatic regional lymph nodes in patients with cutaneous melanoma].", "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM. Early identification of lymph node (LN) metastases has both therapeutic and prognostic significance in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Ultrasonographic (US) examination of LN morphological characteristics and US of LN morphological and vascular characteristics are diagnostic methods used in identification of regional LN metastases, thus rendering a base for lymphonododisection indication. The aim of this study was to determine validity of these two US diagnostic methods and eventual statistically significant difference between them. METHODS. The study included the two groups of the patients with clinical stage III melanoma. The group I included 31 patients followed up by the use of US of LN morphological characteristics due to the fact that US findings described them only. The group II included 30 patients in whom morphological and vascular LN characteristics were followed up. The patients of both groups were examined in the Institute for Radiology, Military Medical Academy using an ultrasonographic unit type Akuson Sequoia Model 2000. After that, therapeutic and elective radical disections were performed. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of US examination of LN were checked by histopathological examination.\nThe presence of LN metastases in the group I was suggested by LN enlargement and its extent, while in the group II it was suggested by the ratio of LN length and width in 83.3% of the patients, echogenicity of LN center in 76.7% of the patients, LN resistance index in 73.3% of the patients, pathologic LN vascularization in 86.7%, and pathologic intranodal arborization in 83.3% of the patients. In 67.7% of the patients in the group I and in 93.3% of the patients in the group II matastatic changes of LN were diagnosed by pathohistology. A difference between validities of the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05).\nLN size without other US morphological and vascular characteristics of LN does not provide enough valid US finding for a reliable preoperative identification of LN with metastatic changes in patients with cutaneous melanoma.", "journal": "Vojnosanitetski pregled", "date": "2010-03-17", "authors": ["GoranSijan", "JeftaKozarski", "DaraStefanovi\u0107", "MikicaLalkovi\u0107", "SasaMili\u0107evi\u0107", "GoranStankovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.2298/vsp1001025s"}

We developed a micro-computerized tomography (micro-CT) method to quantify the marrow contact channel surface (MCCS) with the CEP and to validate the hypothesis according to which MCCS was correlated to the effective permeability of the vertebral endplate (VEP) and influenced by the mechanical stimuli. The influence of compression loading on local vascularization was investigated. Six 4-week-old skeletally immature pigs were instrumented with left pedicle screws and rod at both T5-T6 and L1-L2 levels to create asymmetrical spine tethers. After 3 months of growth, three cylindrical specimens of the VEP (one central and two lateral right and left) were obtained from both the instrumented and the control levels. We used a previously validated method for measuring permeability. Micro-CT analysis (resolution 12 microm) yielded a gray-scale 2D-image of the discal end of each specimen converted into a binary 2D-image to derive the MCCS. Correlations between MCCS and effective permeability were assessed. Effective permeability and MCCS were significantly decreased compared to the control group especially on the tethered side (-41.5%, p = 0.004 and -52.5%, p = 0.0009, respectively). Correlations were significant and showed maximal value (r(2) = 0.430, p < 0.0001) on the tethered side involving maximal compressive loadings. Mechanical stimuli, due to unbalanced growth, altered the vascularization and the convective properties of the CEP.

{"title": "VHL and HIF signalling in renal cell carcinogenesis.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays an important role in renal tumourigenesis. In the majority of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most frequent and highly vascularized RCC subtype, HIF is constitutively activated by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. Of the HIF subunits, HIF-2alpha appears to be more oncogenic than HIF-1alpha, in that HIF-2alpha activates pro-tumourigenic target genes. In addition, recent studies indicate that HIF-1alpha, more than HIF-2alpha, can undergo proteasomal degradation in VHL - /- RCC cells. A more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of hypoxia and angiogenesis in renal carcinogenesis has set the stage for the development of targeted therapies, inhibiting multiple HIF-related pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mTOR, RAS/RAF/MAP, and VEGF signalling routes. However, despite the positive results of these targeting agents in progression-free survival, clinical resistance remains an issue. Recent pre-clinical studies have suggested new targeting approaches such as inhibition of HIF-driven key metabolic enzymes and have introduced new HIF targeting agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, with successful anti-neoplastic effects.

Fifteen rabbits were used for this study. Three of the animals were used in a pilot study to develop the protocol. During the study, thoracodorsal and lateral thoracic vascular pedicles on each side constituted 4 study groups. The pedicles were prepared to simulate prelamination with and without transfer of angiosomes, and prefabrication with and without transfer of angiosomes. In all of the groups, a 10 x 15 mm auricular cartilage graft was used as the construct to be vascularized. After 2 weeks, vascularization of the grafts was evaluated by means of microangiography and histology. Results indicate that both prelamination and prefabrication with transfer of angiosomes displayed better vascularization, both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, prelamination with transfer of angiosomes group displayed distinct statistical superiority.

In the present report, we describe a novel biotechnology concept to create living small diameter TEBV based exclusively on microtissue self-assembly (living cellular re-aggregates). A novel bioreactor was designed to assemble microtissues in a vascular shape and apply pulsatile flow and circumferential mechanical stimulation. Microtissues composed of human artery-derived fibroblasts (HAFs) and endothelial cells (HUVECs) were accumulated and cultured for 7 and 14 days under pulsatile flow/mechanical stimulation or static culture conditions with a diameter of 3mm and a wall thickness of 1mm. The resulting vessels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell phenotype (von Willebrand factor, alpha-SMA, Ki67, VEGF). Self-assembled microtissues composed of fibroblasts displayed significantly accelerated ECM formation compared to monolayer cell sheets. Accumulation of vessel-like tissue occurred within 14 days under both, static and flow/mechanical stimulation conditions. A layered tissue formation was observed only in the dynamic group, as indicated by luminal aligned alpha-SMA positive fibroblasts. We could demonstrate that self-assembled cell-based microtissues can be used to generate small diameter TEBV. The significant enhancement of ECM expression and maturation, together with the pre-vascularization capacity makes this approach highly attractive in terms of generating functional small diameter TEBV devoid of any foreign material.", "journal": "Journal of biotechnology", "date": "2010-03-13", "authors": ["Jens MKelm", "VolkerLorber", "Jess GSnedeker", "D\u00f6rtheSchmidt", "AngelaBroggini-Tenzer", "MartinWeisstanner", "BernhardOdermatt", "AnitaMol", "GregorZ\u00fcnd", "Simon PHoerstrup"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.03.002"}

The most common manifestation is the development of hemangioblastomas typically located in the central nervous system and other organs including the liver. PTEN (Phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10) inactivation also upregulates HIF-1alpha and may take part in promoting vascular lesions in tumors. The coordinate effect of loss of these tumor suppressors on HIF levels, and the subsequent effect on vascular lesion formation would elucidate the potential for mechanisms to modify HIF dosage supplementally and impact tumor phenotype. We therefore employed models of somatic conditional inactivation of Vhl, Pten, or both tumor suppressor genes in individual cells of the liver by Cre-loxP recombination to study the cooperativity of these two tumor suppressors in preventing tumor formation. Nine months after tumor suppressor inactivation, Vhl conditional deletion (Vhl (loxP/loxP)) mice showed no abnormalities, Pten conditional deletion (Pten (loxP/loxP)) mice developed liver steatosis and focal nodular expansion of hepatocytes containing lipid droplet and fat. Vhl and Pten conditional deletion (Vhl (loxP/loxP);Pten (loxP/loxP)) mice, however, developed multiple cavernous liver lesions reminiscent of hemangioblastoma.

We observed an influx of spatially organized host CD11b(+) myeloid cells into the Matrigel implant 1 to 3 days after implantation, which was shown to be cell mediated rather than a nonspecific response. Myeloid cells were significantly reduced once the implants were fully vascularized at days 6 and 7, suggesting an active role during steps that precede formation of functional anastomoses and perfused vessels. Importantly, depletion of circulating myeloid cells resulted in a significant reduction in microvessel density in the implants. In summary, the recruitment of myeloid cells occurs rapidly after coimplantation of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells and is necessary for full vascularization in this model.

NCAM-binding peptide-coated liposomes loaded with both doxorubicin and a lipophilic gadolinium (Gd) derivative were generated. NCAM-targeted liposomes induced an enhanced in vitro doxorubicin internalization within Kaposi's cells as detected by MRI with respect to untargeted polyethylene glycol liposomes. Internalization resulted in enhanced apoptosis. In vivo weekly administration of NCAM-targeted liposomes containing 5 mg/kg doxorubicin for 4 consecutive weeks induced a significant reduction of tumor mass and vascularization and enhanced cell necrosis and apoptosis with respect to untargeted liposomes. These effects were associated with an enhanced concentration of doxorubicin within the tumor and a reduced systemic toxicity of doxorubicin. By electron microscopy, NCAM-targeted liposomes were detected mainly within tumor cells whereas the untargeted liposomes were mainly accumulated in the extracellular space. Gd-labeled liposomes allowed the MRI visualization of drug delivery in the tumor region. The intensity of MRI signal was partially hampered by the \"quenching\" of the attainable relaxation enhancement on endosomal entrapment of the Gd-labeled liposomes.

{"title": "Constructing kidney-like tissues from cells based on programs for organ development: toward a method of in vitro tissue engineering of the kidney.", "abstract": "The plausibility of constructing vascularized three-dimensional (3D) kidney tissue from cells was investigated. The kidney develops from mutual inductive interactions between cells of the ureteric bud (UB), derived from the Wolffian duct (WD), and the metanephric mesenchyme (MM). We found that isolated MMs were capable of inducing branching morphogenesis of the WD (an epithelial tube) in recombination cultures; suggesting that the isolated MM retains inductive capacity for WD-derived epithelial tubule cells other than those from the UB. Hanging drop aggregates of embryonic and adult renal epithelial cells from UB and mouse inner medullary collecting duct cell (IMCD) lines, which are ultimately of WD origin, were capable of inducing MM epithelialization and tubulogenesis with apparent connections (UB cells) and collecting duct-like tubules with lumens (IMCD). This supports the view that the collecting system can be constructed from certain epithelial cells (those ultimately of WD origin) when stimulated by MM. Although the functions of the MM could not be replaced by cultured mesenchymal cells, primary MM cells and one MM-derived cell line (BSN) produced factors that stimulate UB branching morphogenesis, whereas another, rat inducible metanephric mesenchyme (RIMM-18), supported WD budding as a feeder layer. This indicates that some MM functions can be recapitulated by cells. Although engineering of a kidney-like tissue from cultured cells alone remains to be achieved, these results suggest the feasibility of such an approach following the normal developmental progression of the UB and MM. Consistent with this notion, implants of kidney-like tissues constructed in vitro from recombinations of the UB and MM survived for over 5 weeks and achieved an apparently host-derived glomerular vasculature. Lastly, we addressed the issue of optimal macro- and micro-patterning of kidney-like tissue, which might be necessary for function of an organ assembled using a tissue engineering approach. To identify suitable conditions, 3D reconstructions of HoxB7-green fluorescent protein mouse rudiments (E12) cultured on a filter or suspended in a collagen gel (type I or type IV) revealed that type IV collagen 3D culture supports the deepest tissue growth (600 +/- 8 microm) and the largest kidney volume (0.22 +/- 0.02 mm(3)), and enabled the development of an umbrella-shaped collecting system such as occurs in vivo. Taken together with prior work (Rosines et al., 2007; Steer et al., 2002), these results support the plausibility of a developmental strategy for constructing and propagating vascularized 3D kidney-like tissues from recombinations of cultured renal progenitor cells and/or primordial tissue.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

HA-PLGA-SIS significantly enhanced neo-vascularization in an in ovo chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis model. The angiogenic capability of the newly fabricated HA-PLGA-SIS was tested in a canine bladder augmentation model. Urinary bladder augmentation was performed in beagle dogs following hemi-cystectomy using HA-PLGA-SIS. The regenerated bladder was harvested at 10 weeks post augmentation and vascularization was evaluated using CD31 immunohistochemical staining. Bladder regenerated with HA-PLGA-SIS had significantly higher vascular ingrowth compared to unmodified SIS. This study shows that HA-PLGA NPs may represent a new approach for modifying naturally derived SIS biomaterials in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Oxygen tension differentially influences osteogenic differentiation of human adipose stem cells in 2D and 3D cultures.", "abstract": "Skeletal defects commonly suffer from poor oxygen microenvironments resulting from compromised vascularization associated with injury or disease. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) represent a promising cell population for stimulating skeletal repair by differentiating toward the osteogenic lineage or by secreting trophic factors. However, the osteogenic or trophic response of ASCs to reduced oxygen microenvironments is poorly understood. Moreover, a direct comparison between 2D and 3D response of ASCs to hypoxia is lacking. Thus, we characterized the osteogenic and angiogenic potential of human ASCs under hypoxic (1%), normoxic (5%), and atmospheric (21%) oxygen tensions in both 2D and 3D over 4 weeks in culture. We detected greatest alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular calcium deposition in cells cultured in both 2D and 3D under 21% oxygen, and reductions in enzyme activity corresponded to reductions in oxygen tension. ASCs cultured in 1% oxygen secreted more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) over the 4-week period than cells cultured in other conditions, with cells cultured in 2D secreting VEGF in a more sustained manner than those in 3D. Expression of osteogenic markers revealed temporal changes under different oxygen conditions with peak expression occurring earlier in 3D. In addition, the increase of most osteogenic markers was significantly higher in 2D compared to 3D cultures at 1% and 5% oxygen. These results suggest that oxygen, in conjunction with dimensionality, affects the timing of the differentiation program in ASCs. These findings offer new insights for the use of ASCs in bone repair while emphasizing the importance of the culture microenvironment.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2010-03-10", "authors": ["JiaweiHe", "Damian CGenetos", "Clare EYellowley", "J KentLeach"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.22514"}

Normal values of leukocytes, red cells, haematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets. C-Reactive Protein negative. Electrolytes and coagulation tests were normal. Normal vitamin K coagulation proteins levels. Serological tests for TORCH (IgM) and Parvovirus (IgG and IgM) were negative. Sonography showed a reduced blood flow in the iliac artery and reported a 1 cm long vessel thrombosis. From 8 hours of life we administered an intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) 75 UI/Kg for the first 10 minutes then 28 UI/Kg/h.On the 2nd day tests were performed to assess absence of inhibiting-clot factors. The dosage of homocysteine, protein S and antithrombin was normal. FV Leiden and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. The mapping of G20210A prothrombin's gene resulted normal, whereas the concentration of Protein C was lower than normal: activity 46% (68-150%), antigen 35% (70-150%).The same deficiency was also found in the father. The mother showed normal concentrations. No episodes of thrombosis events were documented in the family. The intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy was replaced after 64 hours by subcutaneous nadroparin 600 UI twice/day, which was stopped 5 days later when the vessel sonographic images were completely normal. During the hospitalization the infant didn't show bleeding. The child was followed-up yearly until 4 years of age: he was well and had a normal body and mental development.The final diagnosis is likely to be of a permanent protein C deficiency in heterozygous form. Our case is interesting because the first manifestation was an important thrombosis of large vessel that occurred within a few hours of life in absence of perinatal risk factors, as if it was a homozygous disease, but the patient had a heterozygotic form.

{"title": "Impaired lymphoid organ development in mice lacking the heparan sulfate modifying enzyme glucuronyl C5-epimerase.", "abstract": "The development of lymphoid organs depends on cross talk between hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stromal cells and on vascularization of the lymphoid primordia. These processes are orchestrated by cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors that require tight spatiotemporal regulation. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are molecules designed to specifically bind and regulate the bioactivity of soluble protein ligands. Their binding capacity and specificity are controlled by modification of the HS side chain by HS-modifying enzymes. Although HS proteoglycans have been implicated in the morphogenesis of several organ systems, their role in controlling lymphoid organ development has thus far remained unexplored. In this study, we report that modification of HS by the HS-modifying enzyme glucuronyl C5-epimerase (Glce), which controls HS chain flexibility, is required for proper lymphoid organ development. Glce(-/-) mice show a strongly reduced size of the fetal spleen as well as a spectrum of defects in thymus and lymph node development, ranging from dislocation to complete absence of the organ anlage. Once established, however, the Glce(-/-) primordia recruited lymphocytes and developed normal architectural features. Furthermore, Glce(-/-) lymph node anlagen transplanted into wild-type recipient mice allowed undisturbed lymphocyte maturation. Our results indicate that modification of HS by Glce is required for controlling the activity of molecules that are instructive for early lymphoid tissue morphogenesis but may be dispensable at later developmental stages and for lymphocyte maturation and differentiation.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2010-03-09", "authors": ["Rogier MReijmers", "Mark F RVondenhoff", "RamonRoozendaal", "AnnemiekeKuil", "Jin-PingLi", "MarcelSpaargaren", "Steven TPals", "Reina EMebius"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.0902200"}

In the present study, this subject has been further explored by the analysis of HIF-related marker expression in a benign tumor entity - uterine leiomyomas - using immunohistochemistry, western blotting and RT-PCR. The oxygenation status of 17 leiomyomas was assessed by means of intraoperative polarographic needle electrode measurements. Results show that these tumors are severely and uniformly hypoxic, but do not induce HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 or carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX. Furthermore, this downregulation of the HIF-system was not caused by an overexpression of the hypoxia-inducible prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) 2 and 3. Compared with normal myometrium, leiomyomas also show a poorer vascularization. Conversely, leiomyosarcomas show abundant expression of HIF-related markers despite a similar microvascular density.

We describe our technique of serratus fascial flap harvest, using the Harmonic SYNERGY curved blade (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, Ohio).\nA 21-year-old, right-hand-dominant, male carpenter and martial arts expert was involved in a motorcycle collision and sustained a left-hand dorsal degloving injury and extensor tendon rupture. Soft tissue reconstruction was performed with a serratus fascial free flap, immediate split-thickness skin graft, and palmaris longus tendon grafts. The flap was harvested with the Harmonic blade, which utilizes ultrasonic energy translated into mechanical energy, thereby allowing dissection and hemostasis simultaneously.\nFlap elevation proceeded facilely using the Harmonic curved blade. The patient had no postoperative complications involving his flap or donor site. The closed suction drain in the donor site was removed on postoperative day 3, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10. The patient is doing well at 4 months follow-up.\nThe Harmonic blade may assist in the dissection of the serratus fascial flap by aiding with hemostasis and minimizing surrounding tissue damage.

We therefore screened eight osteosarcoma cell lines for their ability to form vascularized tumours on the CAM.\nWe implanted 3-5 million cells of human osteosarcoma lines (HOS, MG63, MNNG-HOS, OST, SAOS, SJSA1, U2OS, ZK58) on the CAM at day 10 of embryonic development.

{"title": "Tomographic quantification of branching morphogenesis and renal development.", "abstract": "Branching morphogenesis is a central process in renal development, but imaging and quantifying this process beyond early organogenesis presents challenges due to growth of the kidney preventing ready imaging of the complex structures. Current analysis of renal development relies heavily on explant organ culture and visualization by confocal microscopy, as a more developmentally advanced native tissue is too thick for conventional microscopic imaging. Cultured renal primordia lack vascularization and a supportive matrix for normal growth, resulting in tissue compression and distortion of ureteric branching. To overcome this, we used optical projection tomography to image and reconstruct the branching ureter epithelium of ex vivo embryonic kidneys and developed software to quantify these three-dimensional (3D) data. Ureteric branching was assessed by measuring tree and terminal branch length, tip number, branching iterations, branch angles, and inter-tip distances in 3D space. To validate this approach for analyzing genetic influences on renal development, we assessed branching and organ morphology in Tgfbeta2(+/-) embryos from E12.5 through E15.5. We found decreased branching, contrary to previous findings using organ culture, and quantified a primary defect in renal pelvic formation. Our approach offers many advantages from improved throughput, analysis, and observation of in vivo branching states, and has demonstrated its utility in studying the basis of renal developmental disease.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2010-03-05", "authors": ["Kieran MShort", "Mark JHodson", "Ian MSmyth"], "doi": "10.1038/ki.2010.42"}

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) corresponds to the ultrasmall pore predicted by the model of peritoneal transport. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that upregulation of the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries results in increased water permeability and ultrafiltration, without affecting the osmotic gradient or small solute permeability. Conversely, studies in Aqp1 mice have shown that haplo-insufficiency for AQP1 results in significant attenuation of water transport. Recent studies have demonstrated that AQP1 is involved in the migration of different cell types, including endothelial cells. In parallel, chemical screening has identified lead compounds that could act as antagonists or agonists of AQPs, with description of putative binding sites and potential mechanisms of gating the water channel.

We hypothesized that the level of vessel maturation is critically involved in the response to antiangiogenic therapies. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the vascular network in spontaneously developing melanomas of MT/ret transgenic mice after using PTK787/ZK222584 for anti-VEGF therapy but also analyzed human melanoma metastases taken at clinical relapse in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment using bevacizumab. Both experimental settings showed that tumor vessels, which are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy, are characterized by enhanced vessel diameter and normalization of the vascular bed by coverage of mature pericytes and immunoreactivity for desmin, NG-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and the late-stage maturity marker alpha smooth muscle actin. Our findings emphasize that the level of mural cell differentiation and stabilization of the vascular wall significantly contribute to the response toward antiangiogenic therapy in melanoma.

Our study was designed to test whether epigenomic dysregulation mediates the cellular memory of this intrauterine event. To test this hypothesis, we isolated pancreatic islets from control and IUGR (induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation at day 18 of fetal life) animals at 7 weeks of age. Using the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR) assay, we generated the first DNA methylation map at almost 1 million unique sites throughout the rat genome in normal pancreatic islet cells, allowing us to identify the changes that occur as a consequence of IUGR. We validated candidate dysregulated loci with quantitative assays of cytosine methylation and gene expression. IUGR changes cytosine methylation at approximately 1,400 loci (false discovery rate of 4.2%) in male rats at 7 weeks of age, preceding the development of diabetes and thus representing candidate loci for mediating the pathogenesis of metabolic disease that occurs later in life. Epigenetic dysregulation occurred preferentially at conserved intergenic sequences, frequently near genes regulating processes known to be abnormal in IUGR islets, such as vascularization, beta-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and cell death, associated with concordant changes in mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that epigenetic dysregulation is a strong candidate for propagating the cellular memory of intrauterine events, causing changes in expression of nearby genes and long term susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2010-03-03", "authors": ["Reid FThompson", "Melissa JFazzari", "HongshunNiu", "NirBarzilai", "Rebecca ASimmons", "John MGreally"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M109.095133"}

We identified, in fact, two independent tumors, with different localization and sharing some common features, markers of a highly aggressive potential: loss of cell differentiation markers and cell cycle regulators, ability to avoid death by suppressing Fas antigen expression and important invasive capacity by down regulation of E-cadherin expression. However, only in the posterior tumor, we found cells with high proliferation rate, Fas ligand molecule expression and MMP-9 secretion, acquisitions associated with a much more aggressive behavior. These particular phenotypes allowed the posterior cells to grow and to invade the surrounding tissues more rapidly than the anterior ones, leading to the development of a large size tumoral mass, responsible for the clinical symptoms.

In this study, we applied a novel and efficient time-resolved MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) method to investigate in a prostate cancer model the localized temporal dynamics of the uptake of [1-(13)C]-pyruvate and its conversion to metabolic products, specifically [1-(13)C]-lactate. This hyperpolarized (13)C method used multiband excitation pulses for efficient use of the magnetization. This study demonstrated that regions of tumor were differentially characterized from normal tissue by the lactate dynamics, where tumors showed later lactate detection and longer lactate duration that was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Compared to late-pathologic-stage tumors, early- to intermediate-stage tumors demonstrated significantly (P < 0.01) lower lactate total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with similar temporal dynamic parameters. Hyperpolarized pyruvate dynamics provided uptake, perfusion, and vascularization information on tumors and normal tissue.

E-SFCS constituted of a nano-featured fibrillar sheets, whereas SFCS sheets had a smooth morphology with unaligned micro-fibrillar extensions at the ends. Adhesion of hASC to either scaffolds occurred within 30 min and was higher than HUVEC adhesion. The percentage of moving cells and average speed was highest for hASC on SFCS scaffold as compared to hASC cocultured with HUVEC. HUVEC interactions with hASC appeared to slow the speed of hASC migration (in coculture) on both scaffolds.

{"title": "Natural angiogenesis inhibitor signals through Erk5 activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma).", "abstract": "Erk-5, a member of the MAPK superfamily, has a catalytic domain similar to Erk1/2 and a unique C-terminal domain enabling binding with transcription factors. Aberrant vascularization in the Erk5-null mice suggested a link to angiogenesis. Ectopic expression of constitutively active Erk5 blocks endothelial cell morphogenesis and causes HIF1-alpha destabilization/degradation. However the mechanisms by which endogenous Erk5 regulates angiogenesis remain unknown. We show that Erk5 and its activating kinase MEK5 are the upstream mediators of the anti-angiogenic signal by the natural angiogenesis inhibitor, pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF). We demonstrate that Erk5 phosphorylation allows activation of PPARgamma transcription factor by displacement of SMRT co-repressor.

Hydrogels were fabricated with integrin binding sites and protease-sensitive substrates to mimic the natural provisional extracellular matrices, and endothelial cells cultured in these hydrogels organized into stable, intricate networks of capillary-like structures. The resulting structures were further stabilized by recruitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells that differentiated into a smooth muscle cell lineage and deposited collagen IV and laminin in vitro.

{"title": "The role of the fluid phase in the viscous response of bovine periodontal ligament.", "abstract": "The mechanical response of the periodontal ligament (PDL) is complex. This tissue responds as a hyperelastic solid when pulled in tension while demonstrating a viscous behavior under compression. This intricacy is reflected in the tissue's morphology, which comprises fibers, glycosaminoglycans, a jagged interface with the surrounding porous bone and an extensive vascular network. In the present study we offer an analysis of the viscous behavior and the interplay between the fibrous matrix and its fluid phase. Cylindrical specimens comprising layers of dentine, PDL and bone were extracted from bovine first molars and affixed to a tensile-compressive loading machine. The viscous properties of the tissue were analyzed (1) by subjecting the specimens to sinusoidal displacements at various frequencies and (2) by cycling the specimens in 'fully saturated' and in 'partially dry' conditions. Both modes assisted in determining the contribution of the fluid phase to the mechanical response. It was concluded that: (1) PDL showed pseudo-plastic viscous features for cyclic compressive loading, (2) these viscous features essentially resulted from interactions between the porous matrix and unbound fluid content of the tissue. Removing the liquid from the PDL largely eliminates its damping effect in compression.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2010-02-27", "authors": ["MarzioBergomi", "Jo\u00eblCugnoni", "JohnBotsis", "Urs CBelser", "H WAnselm Wiskott"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.12.020"}

Although adequate engraftment of porous poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds has been demonstrated in the past, it has not yet been investigated how vascularization is influenced by vitalization or, more precisely, by seeding PLGA scaffolds with osteoblast-like cells (OLCs). For this reason, we conducted an in vivo study to assess host angiogenic and inflammatory responses after the implantation of PLGA scaffolds vitalized with isogeneic OLCs.\nOLCs were seeded on collagen-coated PLGA scaffolds that were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers in BALB/c mice (n = 8). Two further groups of animals received either collagen-coated (n = 8) or uncoated PLGA scaffolds (n = 8). Animals that received chambers without implants served as controls (n = 8). Angiogenesis, neovascularization, and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction were analyzed for 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy.\nPLGA scaffolds with and without OLCs showed a temporary increase in leukocyte recruitment. At day 3 after implantation, a marked angiogenic host tissue response was observed in close vicinity of all scaffolds studied. At days 6 and 10, the angiogenic response was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in PLGA scaffolds vitalized with OLCs than in uncoated or collagen-coated PLGA scaffolds. The majority of OLCs, however, died within 14 days after implantation.\nOur study demonstrates that PLGA scaffold vitalization with OLCs accelerates the angiogenic response in the surrounding host tissue.

Five women had bilateral masses, giving a total number of 143 masses analyzed. Vascularization was assessed using VOCAL software. 3D-PDA vascular indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) from the most vascularized area within papillary projections and solid areas were calculated automatically using spherical sampling. Five different volumes of sphere were used (1 cm(3), 2 cm(3), 3 cm(3), 4 cm(3) and 5 cm(3)) in each case. A definitive histological diagnosis was obtained in each case after surgical tumor removal.\nOne hundred and seventeen (82%) masses were malignant and 26 (18%) were benign. Morphological evaluation revealed 34 (24%) unilocular solid masses, 49 (34%) multilocular solid masses and 60 (42%) mostly solid masses. The 1-cm(3) sphere could be used in 100% of the cases, the 2-cm(3) sphere could be used in 98.2% of the cases and the 3-5-cm(3) spheres could be used in 97.2% of the cases. The median VI, FI and VFI for all sphere volumes were significantly higher in malignant compared with non-malignant tumors. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis showed that VI and VFI, independently of sphere volume, were better predictors of malignancy than was FI. The best cut-off values for the 3D-PDA indices differed depending on sphere volume. VI was significantly more specific than were VFI and FI.\nSphere volume does not affect the performance of 3D-PDA. We recommend the use of different cut-off values for 3D-PDA indices for discriminating between benign and malignant adnexal masses, depending on the sphere volume used.

{"title": "SDF-1/CXCR4 contributes to the activation of tip cells and microglia in retinal angiogenesis.", "abstract": "PURPOSE. Although stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 contributes to angiogenesis, its effects on sprouting angiogenesis remain ill defined. The authors investigated how SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, influence neovascular sprouting. METHODS. In vivo retinal vascular development was evaluated and ex vivo retinal angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Time-sequential observation was followed by the quantification of movements in neovascular sprouts and microglia. Real-time PCR was performed for the measurement of mRNA levels. RESULTS. Neutralizing antibodies against SDF-1 or an antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, reduced the radius of the vascularized area in retinal vascular development. These inhibitions disturbed the filopodial extensions in tip cells and proliferation in stalk cells, reduced the number of microglia, and decreased the mRNA levels of KDR/Flk-1, UNC5B, and PDGFB, which are abundantly expressed in tip cells. In ex vivo experiments, VEGF induced SDF-1 mRNA expression, and the inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR4 decreased the number of VEGF-induced neovascular sprouts. The authors further evaluated the kinetics of sprouts using time-lapse imaging and found that SDF-1/CXCR4 contributes to the elongation of neovascular sprouts and to the extension and retraction of leading edges. The movements of resident microglia after VEGF treatment were also reduced by SDF-1/CXCR4 inhibition. Interestingly, microglial depletion decreased VEGF-induced neovascular sprouts with the partial effects of SDF-1/CXCR4 blockade. CONCLUSIONS. SDF-1/CXCR4 promotes retinal angiogenesis by both tip cell activation and the indirect angiogenic effects of microglia.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2010-02-26", "authors": ["NoriyukiUnoki", "TomoakiMurakami", "KazuakiNishijima", "KenOgino", "Nicovan Rooijen", "NagahisaYoshimura"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.09-4978"}

Unfortunately, most damaged peripheral nerves have gaps making primary repair impossible. Autologous nerve grafts that are used to repair damaged nerves can either be conventional nonvascularized nerve grafts or vascularized nerve grafts. Vascularized nerve grafts are proposed to be superior to conventional nerve grafts especially in recipient beds that are scarred, with poor vascular supply. One of the disadvantages of vascularized nerve grafts is the limited donor site. It is possible to eliminate this problem by prefabricating vascularized nerve grafts. In this study, to prefabricate a vascularized nerve, segments harvested from left sciatic nerves of 10 Wistar albino rats were implanted on right femoral vessels, and intact right sciatic nerves were used as controls to evaluate the function, electrophysiologic studies, and histopathologic examination, were performed on these grafts 4 weeks after implantation.

In the foetal growth plate, Sox9 is highly expressed in chondrocytes of the proliferating and prehypertrophic zone but declines abruptly in the hypertrophic zone, suggesting that Sox9 downregulation in hypertrophic chondrocytes might be a necessary step to initiate cartilage-bone transition in the growth plate. In order to test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice misexpressing Sox9 in hypertrophic chondrocytes under the control of a BAC-Col10a1 promoter. The transgenic offspring showed an almost complete lack of bone marrow in newborns, owing to strongly retarded vascular invasion into hypertrophic cartilage and impaired cartilage resorption, resulting in delayed endochondral bone formation associated with reduced bone growth. In situ hybridization analysis revealed high levels of Sox9 misexpression in hypertrophic chondrocytes but deficiencies of Vegfa, Mmp13, RANKL and osteopontin expression in the non-resorbed hypertrophic cartilage, indicating that Sox9 misexpression in hypertrophic chondrocytes inhibits their terminal differentiation. Searching for the molecular mechanism of SOX9-induced inhibition of cartilage vascularization, we discovered that SOX9 is able to directly suppress Vegfa expression by binding to SRY sites in the Vegfa gene. Postnatally, bone marrow formation and cartilage resorption in transgenic offspring are resumed by massive invasion of capillaries through the cortical bone shaft, similar to secondary ossification. These findings imply that downregulation of Sox9 in the hypertrophic zone of the normal growth plate is essential for allowing vascular invasion, bone marrow formation and endochondral ossification.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2010-02-25", "authors": ["TakakoHattori", "CatharinaM\u00fcller", "SonjaGebhard", "EvaBauer", "FriederikePausch", "BrittaSchlund", "Michael RB\u00f6sl", "AndreasHess", "CordulaSurmann-Schmitt", "Helgavon der Mark", "Benoitde Crombrugghe", "Klausvon der Mark"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.045203"}

The epoxygenase products, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, are pro-angiogenic, and down-regulation of their biosynthesis by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligands reduces tumor angiogenesis and growth. Endothelial cells lacking a Cyp2c44 epoxygenase, a PPARalpha target, show reduced proliferative and tubulogenic activities that are reversed by the enzyme's metabolites. In a mouse xenograft model of tumorigenesis, disruption of the host Cyp2c44 gene causes marked reductions in tumor volume, mass, and vascularization. The relevance of these studies to human cancer is indicated by the demonstration that: (a) activation of human PPARalpha down-regulates endothelial cell CYP2C9 epoxygenase expression and blunts proliferation and tubulogenesis, (b) in a PPARalpha-humanized mouse model, activation of the receptor inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth, and (c) the CYP2C9 epoxygenase is expressed in the vasculature of human tumors.

Angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were shown to promote biomaterial vascularization and enhance bone formation. However, high local concentrations of VEGF induce the formation of malformed, nonfunctional vessels. We hypothesized that a continuous delivery of low concentrations of VEGF from calcium phosphate ceramics may increase the efficacy of VEGF administration.VEGF was co-precipitated onto biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics to achieve a sustained release of the growth factor. The co-precipitation efficacy and the release kinetics of the protein were investigated in vitro. For in vivo investigations BCP ceramics were implanted into critical size cranial defects in Balb/c mice. Angiogenesis and microvascularization were investigated over 28 days by means of intravital microscopy. The formation of new bone was determined histomorphometrically. Co-precipitation reduced the burst release of VEGF. Furthermore, a sustained, cell-mediated release of low concentrations of VEGF from BCP ceramics was mediated by resorbing osteoclasts. In vivo, sustained delivery of VEGF achieved by protein co-precipitation promoted biomaterial vascularization, osseointegration, and bone formation. Short-term release of VEGF following superficial adsorption resulted in a temporally restricted promotion of angiogenesis and did not enhance bone formation. The release kinetics of VEGF appears to be an important factor in the promotion of biomaterial vascularization and bone formation.

We tested the hypothesis that macrophages recruited during the diverse phases of skin repair after mechanical injury exert specific functions to restore tissue integrity. For this purpose, we developed a mouse model that allows conditional depletion of macrophages during the sequential stages of the repair response. Depletion of macrophages restricted to the early stage of the repair response (inflammatory phase) significantly reduced the formation of vascularized granulation tissue, impaired epithelialization, and resulted in minimized scar formation. In contrast, depletion of macrophages restricted to the consecutive mid-stage of the repair response (phase of tissue formation) resulted in severe hemorrhage in the wound tissue. Under these conditions, transition into the subsequent phase of tissue maturation and wound closure did not occur. Finally, macrophage depletion restricted to the late stage of repair (phase of tissue maturation) did not significantly impact the outcome of the repair response.

Cadaveric dissection was also performed to gain a greater understanding of the surgical anatomy relevant to this procedure.\nIn 6 patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction a rectus abdominis muscle flap was interposed between the bladder neck and urethral stump at bladder neck closure. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications associated with this procedure. At a mean followup of 45.5 months (range 18 to 120) all 6 patients were continent of urine. There have been no urinary fistulas related to use of the rectus abdominis muscle flap.

Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent that specifically targets the vascular endothelial growth factor, exerts an antitumor effect by inhibiting the development of the vascular network that is promoted by the tumor and mandatory for its growth. Yet angiogenesis is also a physiologic event contributing to wound healing and tissue regeneration. To date, it is well documented that the use of bevacizumab in combination with cytotoxic agents greatly improves pathologic response. Also well described is the protective effect of bevacizumab against sinusoidal injuries induced by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Up to now, no side effects related to the perioperative use of bevacizumab have been reported in the setting of liver resection for CLM, and bevacizumab was shown not to impair liver regeneration following portal vein embolization. The clinical consequences of the protective effect of bevacizumab against sinusoidal injuries are hard to evaluate as patient selection and preparation have improved and these improvements contribute greatly to the favorable outcomes following liver resection for CLM. Indeed, patient safety in the setting of hepatic resection for CLM mainly depends on a careful preoperative evaluation of liver volumes and a limited use of cytotoxic agents followed by a delay of at least 5 weeks before the surgery.", "journal": "Journal de chirurgie", "date": "2010-02-23", "authors": ["SZalinski", "J-MBigourdan", "J-NVauthey"], "doi": "10.1016/S0021-7697(10)70004-1"}

In this study, to clarify the effect of tissue fabrication process on a pre-vascular network formation, human origin ECs were introduced into the stratified tissue in several different ways, and the behavior of ECs in various positions of the 3-D tissue were compared each other. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), and their mixture were harvested as an intact cell sheet from temperature-responsive culture dish at low-temperature (<20 degrees C).

Biodegradable collagen scaffolds may be useful in case of fetal therapy for spina bifida, but biochemical properties need to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether biodegradable collagen scaffolds can be used to treat full-thickness fetal skin defects. We hypothesized that the pro-angiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF2 would enhance vascularization, epidermialization and lead to improved wound healing. To investigate the effect of these two growth factors, a fetal sheep model for skin defects was used. Compared to wounds treated with bare collagen scaffolds, wounds treated with growth factor-loaded scaffolds showed excessive formation of capillaries and less myofibroblasts were present in these wounds, leading to less contraction.

In the present study we have investigated, step by step, the destiny of the erythrocytes present in the endodermal vesicles during the embryonic period. Twelve human YSs and their corresponding yolk stalks were analyzed between weeks 4 and 7 of embryonic age by light and scanning electron microscopy. It is shown that erythrocytes (according to their size and morphological features) located within the endodermal vesicles of the YS wall are pulled out through endodermal pits into the YS cavity, from where they reach the lumen of the primitive gut of the embryo through the vitelline duct, a temporary pathway communicating both compartments. During the study period no erythrocytes were seen within the embryo's vascular network where only primitive erythroblasts were identified.

Ionizing radiation represents an effective therapy for GBM, but radiotherapy remains only palliative because of radioresistance. In this study, we demonstrate that glioma cells participate in tumor vascularization and contribute to vascular radioresistance. Using a 3-dimensional coculture system, we observed an intimate interaction of glioma cells with endothelial cells whereby endothelial cells form vascular structures, followed by the recruitment and vascular patterning of glioma cells. In addition, tumor cells stabilize the vascular structures and render them radioresistant. Blocking initial endothelial vascular formation with endothelial-specific inhibitors prevented tumor cells from forming any structures. However, these inhibitors exhibited minimum effects on vascular structures formed by tumor cells, due to the absence of the targeted receptors on tumor cells. Consistent with the in vitro findings, we show that glioma cells form perfused blood vessels in xenograft tumor models.

{"title": "Human cord blood-derived AC133+ progenitor cells preserve endothelial progenitor characteristics after long term in vitro expansion.", "abstract": "Stem cells/progenitors are central to the development of cell therapy approaches for vascular ischemic diseases. The crucial step in rescuing tissues from ischemia is improvement of vascularization that can be achieved by promoting neovascularization. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the best candidates for developing such an approach due to their ability to self-renew, circulate and differentiate into mature endothelial cells (ECs). Studies showed that intravenously administered progenitors isolated from bone marrow, peripheral or cord blood home to ischemic sites. However, the successful clinical application of such transplantation therapy is limited by low quantities of EPCs that can be generated from patients. Hence, the ability to amplify the numbers of autologous EPCs by long term in vitro expansion while preserving their angiogenic potential is critically important for developing EPC based therapies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of cord blood (CB)-derived AC133+ cells to differentiate, in vitro, towards functional, mature endothelial cells (ECs) after long term in vitro expansion.\nWe systematically characterized the properties of CB AC133+ cells over the 30 days of in vitro expansion. During 30 days of culturing, CB AC133+ cells exhibited significant growth potential that was manifested as 148-fold increase in cell numbers. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that CB AC133+ cells' expression of endothelial progenitor markers was not affected by long term in vitro culturing. After culturing under EC differentiation conditions, cells exhibited high expression of mature ECs markers, such as CD31, VEGFR-2 and von Willebrand factor, as well as the morphological changes indicative of differentiation towards mature ECs. In addition, throughout the 30 day culture cells preserved their functional capacity that was demonstrated by high uptake of DiI fluorescently conjugated-acetylated-low density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL), in vitro and in vivo migration towards chemotactic stimuli and in vitro tube formation.\nThese studies demonstrate that primary CB AC133+ culture contained mainly EPCs and that long term in vitro conditions facilitated the maintenance of these cells in the state of commitment towards endothelial lineage.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2010-02-18", "authors": ["BranislavaJanic", "Austin MGuo", "A S MIskander", "Nadimpalli Ravi SVarma", "Alfonso GScicli", "Ali SArbab"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0009173"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of brain iron transport: insight into neurodegeneration and CNS disorders.", "abstract": "Trace metals such as iron, copper, zinc, manganese, and cobalt are essential cofactors for many cellular enzymes. Extensive research on iron, the most abundant transition metal in biology, has contributed to an increased understanding of the molecular machinery involved in maintaining its homeostasis in mammalian peripheral tissues. However, the cellular and intercellular iron transport mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS) are still poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that impaired iron metabolism is an initial cause of neurodegeneration, and several common genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disorders have been proposed to be associated with dysregulated CNS iron homeostasis. This review aims to provide a summary of the molecular mechanisms of brain iron transport. Our discussion is focused on iron transport across endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier and within the neuro- and glial-vascular units of the brain, with the aim of revealing novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and CNS disorders.", "journal": "Future medicinal chemistry", "date": "2010-02-18", "authors": ["EricMills", "Xian-PingDong", "FudiWang", "HaoxingXu"], "doi": "10.4155/fmc.09.140"}
{"title": "Development of hypoxia in a preclinical model of tumor micrometastases.", "abstract": "Hypoxic regions have been shown to be a characteristic feature of a wide variety of human primary tumors, whereas the oxygenation status of subclinical micrometastases is in general unknown. The development of hypoxia in a xenograft model of microscopic metastases was investigated in this study.\nU-25-GFP human melanomas growing in dorsal window chamber preparations in BALB/c nu/nu mice were used as a preclinical model of micrometastases. Tumor blood supply time and morphologic parameters of the vascular network were determined from first-pass imaging movies and vascular maps recorded by use of 155-kDa tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled dextran as a vascular tracer. Tumor hypoxia was assessed from immunohistochemical preparations of the imaged tissue by use of pimonidazole as a hypoxia marker.\nNearly half of the tumors had developed hypoxic regions when they reached a diameter of 2 to 3 mm. Tumors with multiple hypoxic foci showed a low growth rate, low blood flow velocity, high vessel tortuosity, high vessel segment length, and high vascular density, whereas tumors with a single hypoxic region showed a high growth rate, high blood flow velocity, low vessel tortuosity, low vessel segment length, and low vascular density. The tumors with hypoxic regions did not differ from those without hypoxia in any single parameter.\nU-25-GFP xenograft models of vascularized human tumor micrometastases may develop hypoxic regions as a consequence of two distinctly different morphologic abnormalities in the vascular network: high resistance against blood flow (i.e., high vessel tortuosity and high vessel segment length) or low vascular density.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2010-02-18", "authors": ["Trude GSimonsen", "Jon-VidarGaustad", "Einar KRofstad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.09.045"}
{"title": "Analysis of retinal circulation using an image-based network model of retinal vasculature.", "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a circulation analysis using an image based network model of a murine retinal vasculature, which closely represents the 3D vascular distribution of the retina. The uneven distribution of the red blood cells at vascular network bifurcations (i.e., plasma skimming effect), the microvascular diameter effect (i.e., Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect) and the role of endothelium surface layer (i.e., in vivo viscosity) were considered in determining the viscosity of the blood in the retinal vessel segments. The study yielded detailed distributions of the hemodynamic quantities in the arterial and venous trees shown in various anatomical based contour plots. Quantitative analysis was also carried out based on statistical distributions. The analysis shows that the distribution of the blood hematocrit (H(D)) in the retinal network is very non-uniform, with lower values at the pre-equator region (near the optic disc) and higher values in the equator region of the retina. This has significant influence on the distribution of apparent viscosity, pressure and wall shear stress (WSS) in the vasculature. The viscosity is generally higher in smaller vessels (i.e., pre-capillary vessels) but exceptions occur in some vessels where the H(D) is small. WSS is greater in smaller vessels located near the optic disc than that in the mainstream retinal vessels. The results presented can be directly useful to ophthalmologists and researchers working with retinal vasculature.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2010-02-17", "authors": ["PGanesan", "SHe", "HXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2010.02.005"}

PBMCs from healthy subjects were used either directly for cell culture or for CD133(+) sorting. The two groups of cells were cultured in complete medium 199 (M199) for 7 to 14 days and the phenotypes of EPCs were analyzed by FACS. The proliferation of differentiated EPCs was studied by MTT assay, and the VEGF concentration was measured using an ELISA kit. ECM gel experiment and migration assay were performed in vivo. The results showed that PBMCs produced more colony-forming units (CFU) than CD133(+) enriched cells from the same volume of blood (P<0.01). From day 7 to 14, the two groups showed decreased expression of hematopoietic stem cell markers and increased level of endothelial markers, but CD144(+) cells in CD133(+) group were less than in PBMCs group (P<0.01). PBMCs group secreted more VEGF than CD133(+) group on the day 7 (P<0.01). As compared with CD133(+) group, PBMCs group had more potent potential of proliferation and vascularization in vitro.

Both of these processes depend on the detection of environmental guidance cues by endothelial cells. A specialized subtype of endothelial cell known as the tip cell is thought to be involved in the detection and response to these cues, but the molecular signaling pathways used by tip cells to mediate tissue vascularization remain largely uncharacterized. To identify genes critical to tip cell function, we have developed a method to isolate them using laser capture microdissection, permitting comparison of RNA extracted from endothelial tip cells with that of endothelial stalk cells using microarray analysis. Genes enriched in tip cells include ESM-1, angiopoietin-2, and SLP-76.

{"title": "Model of pulmonary fluid traffic homeostasis based on respiratory cycle pressure, bidirectional bronchiolo-pulmonar shunting and water evaporation.", "abstract": "The main puzzle of the pulmonary circulation is how the alveolar spaces remain dry over a wide range of pulmonary vascular pressures and blood flows. Although normal hydrostatic pressure in pulmonary capillaries is probably always below 10 mmHg, well bellow plasma colloid pressure of 25 mmHg, most textbooks state that some fluid filtration through capillary walls does occur, while the increased lymph drainage prevents alveolar fluid accumulation. The lack of a measurable pressure drop along pulmonary capillaries makes the classic description of Starling forces unsuitable to the low pressure, low resistance pulmonary circulation. Here presented model of pulmonary fluid traffic describes lungs as a matrix of small vascular units, each consisting of alveoli whose capillaries are anastomotically linked to the bronchiolar capillaries perfused by a single bronchiolar arteriole. It proposes that filtration and absorption in pulmonary and in bronchiolar capillaries happen as alternating periods of low and of increased perfusion pressures. The model is based on three levels of filtration control: short filtration phases due to respiratory cycle of the whole lung are modulated by bidirectional bronchiolo-pulmonar shunting independently in each small vascular unit, while fluid evaporation from alveolar groups further tunes local filtration. These mechanisms are used to describe a self-sustaining regulator that allows optimal fluid traffic in different settings. The proposed concept is used to describe development of pulmonary edema in several clinical entities (exercise in wet or dry climate, left heart failure, people who rapidly move to high altitudes, acute cyanide and carbon monoxide poisoning, large pulmonary embolisms).", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2010-02-16", "authors": ["SvenKurbel", "BeatricaKurbel", "DanijelaGulam", "BorislavSpaji\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.018"}

They are fed by the articular branch of the descending genicular artery and/or the superomedial genicular artery. Several constant vascular axes can be found, and may serve as a pedicle for a vascularized osteochondral graft from the medial femoral trochlea. The radii of curvature of this graft do fit those of the proximal carpal row.

{"title": "Differentiation of the brain vasculature: the answer came blowing by the Wnt.", "abstract": "Vascularization of the vertebrate brain takes place during embryonic development from a preformed perineural vascular plexus. As a consequence of the intimate contact with neuroectodermal cells the vessels, which are entering the brain exclusively via sprouting angiogenesis, acquire and maintain unique barrier properties known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The endothelial BBB depends upon the close association of endothelial cells with pericytes, astrocytes, neurons and microglia, which are summarized in the term neuro-vascular unit. Although it is known since decades that the CNS tissue provides the cues for BBB induction and differentiation in endothelial cells, the molecular mechanism remained obscure.Only recently, the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the Wnt7a/7b growth factors have been implicated in brain angiogenesis on the one hand and in BBB induction on the other. This breakthrough in understanding the differentiation of the brain vasculature prompted us to review these findings embedded in the emerging concepts of Wnt signaling in the vasculature. In particular, interactions with other pathways that are crucial for vascular development such as VEGF, Notch, angiopoietins and Sonic hedgehog are discussed. Finally, we considered the potential role of the Wnt pathway in vascular brain pathologies in which BBB function is hampered, as for example in glioma, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": "Journal of angiogenesis research", "date": "2010-02-13", "authors": ["StefanLiebner", "Karl HPlate"], "doi": "10.1186/2040-2384-2-1\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000183609.55154.44\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000218510.04541.5e\n10.1083/jcb.200302070\n10.1016/0006-8993(82)91227-6\n10.1007/s00441-003-0751-z\n10.1038/329671a0\n10.3109/08977198909069078\n10.1126/science.277.5323.242\n10.1073/pnas.0805165106\n10.1083/jcb.200806024\n10.1126/science.1164594\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.018\n10.1038/nature01611\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00685-2\n10.1101/gad.13.5.505\n10.1038/jid.2008.445\n10.1016/j.tcb.2007.07.002\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00197-1\n10.1038/ncb0804-687\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00662.x\n10.1016/j.cub.2004.05.039\n10.1007/s10456-008-9095-3\n10.1016/j.gde.2009.09.004\n10.1083/jcb.200212157\n10.1083/jcb.200403050\n10.1016/0014-4886(92)90029-P\n10.1016/0012-1606(81)90382-1\n10.1038/nrn1824\n10.1016/j.devcel.2008.12.009\n10.1095/biolreprod.105.042739\n10.1038/ng957\n10.1167/iovs.05-0174\n10.1086/383202\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00216-8\n10.1083/jcb.200201089\n10.1093/hmg/ddn047\n10.1242/dev.012187\n10.1038/nature03928\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.048\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06237.x\n10.1161/01.RES.0000156273.30274.f7\n10.1074/jbc.M201919200\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.015\n10.1073/pnas.0813221106\n10.1242/dev.02644\n10.1038/89083\n10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00861.x\n10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.062\n10.2174/092986708784638834\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208296\n10.1152/ajpgi.00515.2004\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209330\n10.1038/ncb1534\n10.1038/nm889\n10.1016/S0006-291X(02)02275-1\n10.1023/A:1006416003964\n10.1016/j.molcel.2009.09.034\n10.1016/j.neuint.2009.03.016\n10.1007/s11064-008-9906-3\n10.1073/pnas.0937423100\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.524504\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.492215\n10.1038/27208\n10.1074/jbc.M707108200\n10.1080/08820530701745124\n10.1038/ng0692-204\n10.1159/000046473"}

Determining drug delivery to brain tumors is a challenging problem, and the noninvasive detection of drug directly in the tumor can be critically important for accessing, predicting, and eventually improving effectiveness of therapy. In this study, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to detect an anticancer agent, temozolomide (TMZ), in vivo in murine xenotransplants of U87MG human brain cancer. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the low-molecular-weight contrast agent, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA), was used to evaluate tumor vascular parameters.

Heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) MRS of brain tumors was performed before and after i.p. administration of [(13)C]TMZ.

{"title": "Surgical angiogenesis: a new approach to maintain osseous viability in xenotransplantation.", "abstract": "Large segmental osseous defects are challenging clinical problems. Current reconstructive methods, using non-viable allografts, vascularized autografts or prostheses have significant rates of serious complications and failure. These include infection, stress fracture and non-union (frozen structural allogenic bone); loosening and implant failure (prosthetic replacement); limited availability, poor match of size and shape and donor site morbidity (vascularized autograft bone). In the future, microvascular transplantation of living allogenic or xenogenic bone could solve some of these issues, combining the advantages of living bone autografts (capability of primary osseous healing, remodeling, and fracture resistance) with the ability to match size and shape, provide immediate stability and avoid donor site morbidity. Xenotransplants would be particularly attractive, as they could be readily available, if long-term bone survival could be achieved without unacceptable morbidity. Here, we present a preliminary study to evaluate a new and unique method to maintain xenogenic bone circulation without need for long-term immune modulation that depends upon generation of a neo-angiogenic circulation within the transplanted bone from recipient-derived vessels. Thus, only short-term immunosuppression would be required to achieve bone survival.\nOne hundred and forty-one hamster femora were microsurgically transplanted to rats, restoring nutrient vessel circulation with standard microvascular anastomoses. At the same time, a host-derived arteriovenous bundle (AVB) was placed within the medullary canal. Two independent variables were evaluated: use of tacrolimus/cyclophosmamid immunosuppression (IS) and patency of the implanted AVB. Rats were therefore randomized to four groups; group 1-no IS + patent AVB; group 2-no IS + ligated AVB; group 3-IS + patent AVB; group 4-IS + ligated AVB. Rats were sacrificed after 1 or 2 weeks. We evaluated bone blood flow (microsphere entrapment), neoangiogenesis (microangiography and quantification of capillary density), bone necrosis rate (osteocyte counts) and nutrient pedicle rejection (microsurgical anastomotic patency). Statistical Analysis was performed with two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.\nCapillary density was significantly increased with a patent intramedullary AVB (groups 1/3) compared to groups with ligated AVBs (groups 3/4). Capillary sprouting was predominantly restricted to the endosteal layer. Most nutrient pedicles (78.7%) stayed patent in groups with IS (groups 3 and 4). Consequently, bone blood flow was significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 compared to groups 1 and 2. Similarly, a patent AV bundle improved flow in group 1 when compared to group 2. The bone necrosis rate was not influenced by the presence of patent AVBs but was significantly reduced in groups 3 and 4.\nSurgical angiogenesis occurs when patent arteriovenous bundles are placed in the medullary canal of xenogenic bone and leads to increased bone blood flow.

Optical imaging has contributed greatly to our current understanding of beta cell structure and function. In vitro microscopy of beta cell lines has revealed the localization of molecular components in the cell and more recently their dynamic behavior. In cultured islets, interactions of beta cells with other islet cells and the matrix as well as paracrine and autocrine signaling or reaction to nutrients have been studied. Lastly, microscopy has been performed on tissue sections, visualizing the islets in an environment closer to their natural surroundings. In most efforts to date, the samples have been isolated for investigation and hence have by definition been divorced from their natural environments and deprived of vascularization and innervations. In such a setting the beta cells lack the metabolic information that is primordial to their basic function of maintaining glucose homeostasis. We review optical microscopy; its general principles, its impact in decoding beta cell function and its recent developments towards the more physiologically relevant assessment of beta cell function within the environment of the whole organism. This requires both large imaging depth and fast acquisition times. Only few methods can achieve an adequate compromise.

{"title": "Influence of polymer content in Ca-deficient hydroxyapatite-polycaprolactone nanocomposites on the formation of microvessel-like structures.", "abstract": "Calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramics are widely used in bone tissue engineering due to their good osteoconductivity. The mechanical properties of CaP can be modified by the addition of small volume fractions of biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL). Nevertheless, it is also important to evaluate how the polymer content influences cell-material or cell-cell interactions because of potential consequences for bone regeneration and vascularization. In this study we assessed the general biocompatibilty of Ca-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA)-PCL disks containing nominally 11 and 24% polycaprolactone using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human primary osteoblasts. Confocal microscopy showed that both CDHA-PCL variants supported the growth of both cell types. In terms of the endothelial cells grown on CDHA-PCL nanocomposites with 24% PCL, an increased expression of the endothelial marker vWF compared to CDHA-PCL with 11% PCL was observed in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. In addition to monocultures, co-cultures of outgrowth endothelial cells, derived from peripheral blood, and primary osteoblasts were assessed as an example of a more complex test system for bone regeneration and vascularization. Constructs based on CDHA with different PCL contents were investigated with regard to the formation of microvessel-like structures induced by the co-culture process using confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. Furthermore, the osteogenic differentiation of the co-culture was assessed. As a result, more pre-vascular structures were observed after 1 week on the CDHA-PCL disks with 24% PCL, whereas after 4 weeks of culture the extent of microvessel-like structure formation was slightly higher on the CDHA with 11% PCL. In contrast to this, variation of PCL content had no effect on the osteogenic differentiation in the co-culture.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2010-02-11", "authors": ["SFuchs", "XJiang", "IGotman", "CMakarov", "HSchmidt", "E YGutmanas", "C JKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.001"}

Primary tracheal reconstructions are commonly performed, but complications such as tension and inadequate vascular supply limit the length of surgical resection. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a hydrated, decellularized porcine tracheal extracellular matrix showed the potential to serve as a functional tracheal replacement graft. Porcine tracheas were decellularized and evaluated to characterize their biochemical composition and biomechanical behavior. Hydrated decellularized tracheal matrix (HDTM) grafts (>5 cm) were implanted heterotopically beneath the strap muscle and wrapped in the omentum in a canine model for 2 and 8 weeks followed by histologic and mechanical analysis. HDTM patches (2 x 3 cm) were also used in a patch tracheoplasty model. The repair site was evaluated bronchoscopically and radiographically, and the grafts were analyzed by histologic methods to evaluate epithelialization and persistence of the cartilage rings. The present study showed that HDTM maintains mechanical characteristics necessary for function under physiologic loading conditions even after 8 weeks of heterotopic implantation. After orthotopic implantation, the grafts were shown to support development of a columnar, pseudostratified, ciliated epithelium, but the cartilage structures showed histologic evidence of degradation and limited new cartilage formation. The results of the study showed tracheal ECM scaffolds support the formation of site-specific epithelium and provide sufficient mechanical integrity withstand physiologic pressures in the short-term.

Placental growth factor (PlGF), a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) homologue, establishes its angiogenic capacity under pathophysiological conditions. We investigated the function of PlGF in experimental models of acute colitis. Acute colonic damage was induced in PlGF knock-out ((-/-)) mice and PlGF wild-type ((+/+)) mice by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The concentrations of PlGF and VEGF were measured in distal colonic lysates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Colonic injury was evaluated by assessing colon length, colonocyte apoptosis (by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling), colonic cytokine production and histological score. Infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells was determined by assaying myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In a separate experiment, recombinant PlGF was administered to PlGF(-/-) mice by adenoviral transfer before DSS administration. Mucosal vascularization was quantified by computerized morphometric analysis of CD31-stained distal colonic sections. Colonic mucosal hypoxia was visualized by pimonidazole staining. Both VEGF and PlGF were upregulated during acute colitis. In addition, compared with PlGF(+/+) controls, PlGF(-/-) mice showed a significant increase in weight loss and colonic shortening during both DSS and TNBS colitis. This correlated with enhanced colonocyte apoptosis, elevated colonic cytokine levels and increased histological damage score, but not with enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration (MPO activity). The increased morbidity of PlGF(-/-) mice during DSS colitis was preventable by adenovirus (Ad)-mediated overexpression of PlGF. After the administration of DSS, strongly reduced mucosal angiogenesis was observed in PlGF(-/-) mice compared with PlGF(+/+) mice. This was associated with an early increase in intestinal epithelial pimonidazole accumulation in PlGF(-/-) mice, suggesting a function of enhanced epithelial hypoxia in the observed differences between the two groups. In summary, our data show that the absence of PlGF strongly inhibits mucosal intestinal angiogenesis in acute colitis, which is associated with an early increase in intestinal epithelial hypoxia and aggravation of the course of the disease.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2010-02-10", "authors": ["PieterHindryckx", "AnoukWaeytens", "DebbyLaukens", "HaraldPeeters", "JacquesVan Huysse", "LiesbethFerdinande", "PeterCarmeliet", "MartineDe Vos"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2010.37"}

These features of impaired nerve regeneration were largely attenuated in diabetic AR(-/-)YFP mice. Retarded macrophage invasion and vascularization associated with Wallerian degeneration were normalized in diabetic AR(-/-)YFP mice.

{"title": "Complementary interplay between matrix metalloproteinase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and osteoclast function drives endochondral bone formation.", "abstract": "Long bone development depends on endochondral bone formation, a complex process requiring exquisite balance between hypertrophic cartilage (HC) formation and its ossification. Dysregulation of this process may result in skeletal dysplasias and heterotopic ossification. Endochondral ossification requires the precise orchestration of HC vascularization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the recruitment of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteoclasts have all been shown to regulate endochondral ossification, but how their function interrelates is not known. We have investigated the functional relationship among these regulators of endochondral ossification, demonstrating that they have complementary but non-overlapping functions. MMP-9, VEGF and osteoclast deficiency all cause impaired growth plate ossification resulting in the accumulation of HC. VEGF mRNA and protein expression are increased at the MMP-9-/- growth plate, and VEGF activity contributes to endochondral ossification since sequestration of VEGF by soluble receptors results in further inhibition of growth plate vascularization and ossification. However, VEGF bioavailability is still limited in MMP-9 deficiency, as exogenous VEGF is able to rescue the MMP-9-/- phenotype, demonstrating that MMP-9 may partially, but not fully, regulate VEGF bioavailability. The organization of the HC extracellular matrix at the MMP-9-/- growth plate is altered, supporting a role for MMP-9 in HC remodeling. Inhibition of VEGF impairs osteoclast recruitment, whereas MMP-9 deficiency leads to an accumulation of osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous junction. Growth plate ossification in osteoclast-deficient mice is impaired in the presence of normal MMP-9 expression, indicating that other osteoclastic functions are also necessary. Our data delineate the complementary interplay between MMP-9, VEGF and osteoclast function that is necessary for normal endochondral bone formation and provide a molecular framework for investigating the molecular defects contributing to disorders of endochondral bone formation.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2010-02-10", "authors": ["NathalieOrtega", "KeWang", "NapoleoneFerrara", "ZenaWerb", "Thiennu HVu"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.004226"}

Four patients had undergone surgery previously: two had initial pinning of the acute AC joint separation, and two had a subsequent Mumford procedure. The surgical technique, performed entirely by arthroscopy, consisted of (1) rerouting the coracoacromial ligament with a bone block harvested from the tip of the acromion in a socket created in the distal clavicle (Chuinard's modification of the Weaver-Dunn procedure) and (2) augmenting the reconstruction with 2 titanium buttons connected by a heavy suture in a 4-strand configuration (Double-Button fixation; Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA). Patients were prospectively followed up for a mean of 12.8 months (range, 6 to 20 months).\nOne patient had a superficial infection of the superior (clavicular) portal, which resolved with oral antibiotics.

Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) promotes vessel assembly, whereas Ang-2 and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) cause vessel breakdown. To determine the potential effect of estrogen on the expression of these angioregulatory factors in the endometrium, Ang-1, Ang-2, TSP-1, and Tie-2 receptor mRNA levels were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in glandular epithelial and stromal cells isolated from the endometrium of ovariectomized baboons treated acutely with estradiol. Corresponding protein expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry and the proximity ligation assay (PLA) during advancing stages of the baboon menstrual cycle. Serum estradiol levels in ovariectomized baboons were 400 pg/ml within 4-6 hr of estradiol treatment. Ang-1 mRNA levels in glandular epithelial cells increased threefold (P < 0.01) within 4 hr of estradiol administration. In contrast, TSP-1 mRNA levels decreased four- to fivefold (P < 0.01) in endometrial glandular epithelial and stromal cells 4-6 hr after estradiol, whereas Ang-2 and Tie-2 expression was unaltered. Immunostaining for Ang-1 increased, TSP-1 decreased, and Ang-2 and Tie-2 were unaltered in the endometrium during the secretory compared with the proliferative phase of the cycle. Endometrial Ang-1 protein expression, quantified by PLA, increased 10-fold (P < 0.05) between the early proliferative and late proliferative/mid-secretory phases of the menstrual cycle in association with the rise in estrogen.

Marrow-derived cytokines induce host neovascularization at the graft surface, but hypoxic conditions cause cell death at the core. Addition of cellular components that generate an extensive primitive plexus-like vascular network that would perfuse the entire scaffold upon anastomosis could potentially yield significantly higher-quality grafts. We used a mouse model to develop a two-stage protocol for generating vascularized bone grafts using mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from human bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived endothelial cells. The endothelial cells formed tube-like structures and subsequently networks throughout the bone scaffold 4-7 days after implantation. hMSCs were essential for stable vasculature both in vitro and in vivo; however, contrary to expectations, vasculature derived from hMSCs briefly cultured in medium designed to maintain a proliferative, nondifferentiated state was more extensive and stable than that with hMSCs with a TGF-beta-induced smooth muscle cell phenotype. Anastomosis occurred by day 11, with most hMSCs associating closely with the network. Although initially immature and highly permeable, at 4 weeks the network was mature. Initiation of scaffold mineralization had also occurred by this period.

The MSC sheets were harvested from culture flasks, wrapped around implants to construct the complexes, and then cultured in osteogenic medium. The layered cell sheets integrated well with implants and remained viable, with small mineralized nodules visible on the implant surfaces for up to four weeks after culture. Cells on the implants underwent classical in vitro osteogenic differentiation with an associated elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity and bone- and vascular-related protein expression. In vivo, two kinds of cell sheet-implant complexes were transplanted under the skin of SCID mice and cultured for eight weeks. For the MSC sheet titanium implant complex, histological examination revealed that new bone tissue that formed around implants followed a predominantly endochondral pathway, exhibiting histological markers of native bone; for the MSC sheet zirconia implant complex, however, intramembranous ossification appeared to occur on the surface of the zirconia implant, as observed with typical osteocytes embedded in dense matrix and accompanied by both microvessels and marrow cavities.

The statistical analysis of SI and VEGF expression was performed using Anova and Tukey as a postcomparison test. The results show that in the second group, the curve of SI changes the time points for maximum and minimum activity, and the peak of VEGF expression appears before the first group. In conclusion, in the hepatectomized mice, the increases of hepatic proliferation, measured by the SI index, may produce a rise in VEGF expression with the object of generating a vascular network for hepatic regeneration.

Attempts to engineer bone tissue have predominantly focused on intramembranous (direct) bone formation. A relatively new and most likely more physiological approach in this line is endochondral bone formation, comprising an intermediate cartilaginous stage. Cartilage in nature is an avascular tissue and its cells are equipped to survive the poor oxygenation and nutritional conditions inherent to implanted tissues. Subsequent terminal differentiation (hypertrophy) of the chondrocytes initiates the formation of a mineralized matrix that will then be converted into bone. Through this mechanism, our long bones grow and most fractures heal through the process of secondary fracture healing. The feasibility of the attractive concept of endochondral bone tissue engineering has already been shown. Most emphasis has gone to the multipotent stromal cells because of their great potential for expansion and differentiation and immunoprivileged nature.

This may be due to the duration of carcinogenesis or age related changes providing a favorable environment for tumor formation. Aging is associated with molecular, cellular and physiological events that influence carcinogenesis and cancer growth. Physiologic cell proliferation, differentiation, and aging can result in cell death. However, under the influence of exogenous or endogenous factors cells can undergo pathologic dedifferentiation, immortalization, and neoplastic clone formation. The effects of age have been recognized in both animal and human malignancies. These processes can result in cellular senescence as a barrier to tumorigenesis. Inducing senescence is an important outcome for the successful treatment of cancers particularly those resistant to apoptosis. Senescence is associated with polyploidy in several human cell lines. Polyploid cells are dangerous in that they can undergo aberrant mitoses giving rise to unstable progeny. Polyploid cells have been shown to escape senescence and divide. We examined the effects of aging on squamous cell carcinoma formation in a mouse model. Chronologically aged mice experience shorter tumor latency periods than wild-type animals. Tumors in aged mice were poorly vascularized, necrotic, and produced significantly fewer cervical lymph node metastases. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression was similar in primary tumors from young and old mice, but microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors arising in aged mice.

Four weeks after BM transplant, Ewing's sarcoma TC71 or A4573 cells were injected, and tumor growth and vessel density were compared. Strikingly, chimeric mice transplanted with Mekk3(Deltaflox/-) BM exhibited a reduction in tumor growth and vessel density compared with mice transplanted with Mekk3(Deltaflox/+) BM cells.

The peptide also decreased the rate of tumor growth and microvascular density in vivo in a small cell lung cancer xenograft model.\nThe peptide treatment significantly decreased the invasion of microvessels in angioreactors and the rate of tumor growth in the xenograft model, indicating potential treatment for angiogenesis-dependent disease, and for translational development as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2010-02-04", "authors": ["Jacob EKoskimaki", "Emmanouil DKaragiannis", "Benjamin CTang", "HansHammers", "D NeilWatkins", "RobertoPili", "Aleksander SPopel"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-10-29\n10.3322/CA.2007.0010\n10.1007/s11912-008-0043-6\n10.2217/14796694.3.2.131\n10.1016/S0169-5002(00)00124-0\n10.1517/14728222.11.8.1033\n10.1073/pnas.0803241105\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.231\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e328011bec3\n10.4065/83.3.355\n10.2174/138161207781039715\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.08.011\n10.1073/pnas.0807055105\n10.1215/15228517-2009-012\n10.1006/excr.1994.1017"}
{"title": "Corrosion study of iron-cobalt alloys for MRI-based propulsion embedded in untethered microdevices operating in the vascular network.", "abstract": "Our group have shown in an experiment performed in the carotid artery of a living swine that magnetic gradients generated by a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system could propel and navigate untethered medical microdevices and micro-nanorobots in the human vasculature. The main problem with these devices is that the metal necessary for magnetic propulsion may corrode and induce cytotoxic effects. The challenge, then, is to find an alloy with low corrosion yet providing an adequate magnetization level for propulsion in often stringent physiological conditions. Because of their high magnetization, we studied the corrosion behavior of two iron-cobalt alloys, Permendur (49% Fe, 49% Co, 2% V) and Vacoflux 17 (81% Fe, 17% Co, 2% Cr), in physiological solution by potentiodynamic polarization assay, surface analysis, and corrosion electrolyte analysis. Both alloys exhibited low corrosion parameters such as a corrosion potential (E(corr)) of -0.57 V/SCE and E(corr) of -0.42 V/SCE for Vacoflux 17. The surface of Permendur samples was homogenously degraded. Vacoflux 17 surface was impaired by cracks and crevices. Both alloys had a stoichiometric dissolution in the electrolyte, and they released enough cobalt to induce cytotoxic effects. This study concluded that Fe-Co alloys could be used preferably in medical microdevices if they were coated so as not to come in contact with physiological solutions.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

ADAM8-deficient mice have no evident spontaneous developmental or pathological defects, and little is currently known about the role of ADAM8 in disease. Here, we investigated the contribution of ADAM8 to pathological neovascularization in mice using an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model and heterotopical injection of tumor cells. We found an increase in retinal re-vascularization but fewer neovascular tufts in the OIR model and increased growth of heterotopically injected tumor cells in Adam8-/- mice compared with wild-type controls. These results suggest that ADAM8 functions to limit both of these processes in wild-type mice. In cell-based assays, overexpression of ADAM8 increased the ectodomain shedding of several co-expressed membrane proteins with roles in angiogenesis (CD31, Tie-2, Flk-1, Flt-1, EphrinB2, EphB4, VE-cadherin, KL-1, E-selectin, and neuregulin-1beta2). Thus, dysregulated expression of ADAM8 in endothelial cells in vivo could potentially increase the processing of these and other substrate proteins. Taken together, our findings suggest that inhibiting ADAM8 could be useful for promoting re-vascularization and thereby preventing formation of neovascular tufts in proliferative retinopathies. On the other hand, blocking ADAM8 could be detrimental in the context of rapidly growing tumors.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2010-02-02", "authors": ["Victor HGuaiquil", "StevenSwendeman", "WenhuiZhou", "PatricioGuaiquil", "GiselaWeskamp", "J\u00f6rg WBartsch", "Carl PBlobel"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-010-0591-8"}

The small neotropical family Metteniusaceae was recently placed within the lamiids, as sister to either the enigmatic Oncothecaceae or the clade (Boraginaceae + Gentianales + Lamiales + Solanales + Vahliaceae). We examined the development of two of the primary diagnostic traits of Metteniusaceae, the moniliform anthers and the unilocular gynoecium. The gynoecium is 5-carpellate, and contains two ovules with a massive, vascularized integument. Late sympetaly and unitegmic ovules support placement of Metteniusaceae in the lamiids. The 5-carpellate gynoecium is consistent with a sister-group relationship between Metteniusaceae and Oncothecaceae. The gynoecium of Metteniusaceae is unusual in that it is monosymmetric throughout ontogeny, which indicates pseudomonomery; the five carpel initials are congenitally fused by their margins and form a single locule; the two ovules develop from the two smallest and most poorly developed lateral carpels. Comparisons with other pseudomonomerous taxa allow us to propose division of the complex processes leading to pseudomonomery into eight characters, including carpel number and fusion, gynoecial symmetry, timing of carpel reduction, and number and position of nonfertile carpels.", "journal": "American journal of botany", "date": "2010-02-01", "authors": ["Favio AGonz\u00e1lez", "Paula JRudall"], "doi": "10.3732/ajb.0900194"}

In this study, we used a subcutaneous implantation model in Wistar rats to examine SF scaffolds prepared by treating the degummed cocoon with FA for either 30 or 60 min. The tissue reaction and inflammatory response to SF was assessed by qualitative histology at intervals from 3 to 180 days. Additionally, dynamic biomaterial-induced vascularization and biomaterial degradation were quantified using a technique for analysing an image of the entire implanted biomaterial. Varying the FA treatment time led to different scaffold morphologies and resulted in two distinct peri-implant tissue reactions. The 30 min-treated scaffold was integrated into the surrounding tissue beginning at day 3 after implantation and vascularization increased 10-fold from 15 to 180 days, while the scaffold was continuously degraded throughout the first 90 days. In contrast, the 60 min-treated SF scaffold appeared as bulk for the first 90 days after implantation, after which a rapid degradation and vascularization process began. After 180 days, the tissue response was similar for both scaffolds, with eventual formation of a well vascularized connective tissue integrating the SF fibres. This study indicates that by modifying the FA treatment time, the tissue reaction to SF scaffolds can be tailored for different tissue-engineering applications. The tunability and biocompatibility of SF make it an attractive scaffold for exploration in regenerative medicine and clinical tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2010-01-30", "authors": ["ShahramGhanaati", "CarinaOrth", "Ronald EUnger", "MikeBarbeck", "Matthew JWebber", "AntonellaMotta", "ClaudioMigliaresi", "CJames Kirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1002/term.257"}

Although many PGL mutations have been described, gross SDHD deletions have not yet been implicated as founder mutations and are rarely characterized at the DNA sequence level. We investigated the genetic basis of head and neck PGLs observed in 20 subjects from two unrelated multiplex pedigrees from Austria and identified a 4944-base pair partial SDHD deletion, which escaped PCR-based detection methods. The deletion occurred between Alu elements and was present within the same haplotype context in both pedigrees, indicating a founder effect. The deletion caused tumors only after a paternal transmission similar to other conventional SDHD mutations, suggesting preservation of genomic imprinting mechanisms operating at this locus.

This cell-based therapy is hindered by significant apoptosis of EC upon transplantation as well as poor recruitment of host mural cells to stabilize nascent vessels. Here, we address these deficiencies by augmenting endothelial cell transplantation with dual delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) - to improve survival of transplanted EC - and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) - to induce mural cell recruitment. We produced alginate microparticles that deliver VEGF and MCP-1 with distinct release kinetics and that can be integrated into a collagen/fibronectin (protein) gel construct for delivery of EC. Combined delivery of VEGF and MCP-1 increased functional vessel formation from transplanted EC and also led to a higher number of smooth muscle cell-invested vessels than did EC therapy alone. Despite the well-known role of MCP-1 in inflammation, these beneficial effects were accomplished without a long-term increase in monocyte/macrophage recruitment or a shift to a pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage phenotype. Overall, these data suggest a potential benefit of combined delivery of MCP-1 and VEGF from EC-containing hydrogels as a strategy for therapeutic vascularization.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-01-30", "authors": ["Steven MJay", "Benjamin RShepherd", "Jillian WAndrejecsk", "Themis RKyriakides", "Jordan SPober", "W MarkSaltzman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.014"}

We recognize the vessels are not tubes with ends that get glued but physiological factors are relevant into the vascular development. Our contribution integrates the graph theory and physiological information to derive a quantitative model for the vascular tree in the sense that the vertices and edges represent, respectively, a branching point and a vessel. From such a premise, development of the arterial vascular tree of the kidney is mathematically expressed, including physiological processes as the effect of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the vessel length. A definition of the graph is used to visualize the topology of vascular tree in kidney providing physiological information into the edges.

Tissues from most donor species fully mature, exhibiting complete spermatogenesis within months. The connection to the recipient's vascular system is mandatory for graft development, and failure of vascularization leads to necrosis in the grafted tissue. In the present study, we analyze to what extent 1) the xenografted immature donor tissue and 2) the recipient's cells and tissues contribute to the functional recovery of a \"testicular xenograft.\" We address whether recipient cells migrate into the testicular parenchyma and whether the circulatory connection between the donor testicular tissue and the recipient is established by ingrowing host or outgrowing donor blood vessels. Although this issue has been repeatedly discussed in previous xenografting studies, so far it has not been possible to unequivocally distinguish between donor and recipient tissues and thus to identify the mechanisms by which the circulatory connection is established. To facilitate the distinction of donor and recipient tissues, herein we used immature green fluorescent protein-positive rat testes as donor tissues and adult nude mice as graft recipients. At the time of graft recovery, donor tissues could be easily identified by the GFP expression in these tissues, allowing us to distinguish donor- and recipient-derived blood vessels. We conclude that the circulatory connection between graft and host is established by a combination of outgrowing small capillaries from the donor tissue and formation of larger vessels by the host, which connect the graft to subcutaneous blood vessels.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2010-01-29", "authors": ["StefanSchlatt", "BirgitWesternstr\u00f6er", "KathrinGassei", "JensEhmcke"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.109.082073"}

Fat loss occurred with no change of energy expenditure but reduced food intake that occurred without signs of illness and despite reduced circulating leptin and reduced hypothalamic POMC gene expression, indicating that the decrease in food intake is independent of the action of leptin.\nThese experiments provide compelling evidence for a previously unknown relationship between the status of adipose tissue vasculature and the regulation of food intake.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2010-01-28", "authors": ["Dong-HoonKim", "Stephen CWoods", "Randy JSeeley"], "doi": "10.2337/db09-1141"}

The MSs were characterized, and their tissue reaction and degradation in rats was examined. Histological analysis of the explants after 14 and 28 days in vivo also showed that Syn-RG was degraded slower than Hu-RG, which correlated with the in vitro degradation assay. Hu-RG explants displayed more cellular ingrowth (60% vs. 15% for Syn-RG at day 14), which was associated with extracellular matrix deposition and vascularization. The infiltrating cells consisted of mainly macrophages, part of which fused to giant cells locally, and fibroblasts. No differences were found in matrix metalloproteinase mRNA levels, whereas gelatinase activity was clearly higher in Hu-RG explants.

These mice developed normally and had no obvious cardiac abnormalities as adults. However, evaluation of the vasculature revealed that juvenile doxorubicin exposure impaired vascular development, resulting in abnormal vascular architecture in the hearts with less branching and decreased capillary density. Both physiological and pathological stress induced late-onset cardiotoxicity in the adult doxorubicin-treated mice.

Possible causes have been related to fibrotic change of the muscle either due to devascularization or compartment-like syndrome after a tight wound closure. This study elucidates the vascularization and nerve supply of the FHL muscle after fibula flap harvest in a fresh cadaver model.A fibula bone flap was harvested through a lateral approach in 20 fresh limbs. The popliteal artery was isolated and injected with a silicone compound, the muscle isolated, and its neurovascular supply visualized.The distal third and fourth portion of the FHL muscle was always found to be located in a more compressed and deeper compartment. The peroneal artery was entirely filled by the silicone compound in 17 fresh cadaver limbs with at least one branch supplying the distal fourth of the FHL. The posterior tibialis artery was filled in all limbs and an average of 2 branches was found to supply the muscle. In all dissections, the nerve supplying the FHL originated from the tibialis nerve with an average of three branches perforating the muscle.Following fibula harvest, the FHL muscle will maintain vascular supply through the distal portion of the peroneal artery and the posterior tibialis artery.

However, the procedure is often incomplete owing to extensive vascular structure and arteriovenous shunts. We report our experience with embolization of these lesions by means of direct puncture and intratumoral injection of n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) or Onyx. Ten patients aged 32-82 years who were referred for preoperative embolization of seven carotid body tumors and three jugular paragangliomas were retrospectively analyzed. Intratumoral injections were primarily performed in four cases with multiple small-caliber arterial feeders and adjunctive to transarterial embolization in six cases with incomplete devascularization. Punctures were performed under ultrasound and injections were performed under roadmap fluoroscopic guidance. Detailed angiographies were performed before and after embolization procedures. Control angiograms showed complete or near-complete devascularization in all tumors. Three tumors with multiple small-caliber arterial feeders were treated with primary NBCA injections. One tumor necessitated transarterial embolization after primary injection of Onyx. Six tumors showed regional vascularization from the vasa vasorum or small-caliber branches of the external carotid artery following the transarterial approach. These regions were embolized with NBCA injections. No technical or clinical complications related to embolization procedures occurred. All except one of the tumors were surgically removed following embolization.

However, these differences have not been formally described, nor have any angiogenic factors been implicated to be involved in the Wnt1 tumors.\nHere, we show that MMTV-Wnt1 tumors were more vascularized than MMTV-Her2 tumors, and this correlated with significantly higher expression of a CXC chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1/CXCL12) but not with VEGFA. Isolation of various cell types from Wnt1 tumors revealed that SDF1 was produced by both tumor myoepithelial cells and stromal cells, whereas Her2 tumors lacked myoepithelial cells and contained significantly less stroma. The growth of Wnt1 tumors, but not Her2 tumors, was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to SDF1, but not by neutralization of VEGFA. Anti-SDF1 treatment decreased the proportion of infiltrating Gr1(+) myeloid cells in the Wnt1 tumors, which correlated with a decrease in the percentage of endothelial cells. The involvement of Gr1(+) cells was evident from the retardation of Wnt1 tumor growth following in vivo depletion of these cells with an anti-Gr1-specific antibody. This degree of inhibition on Wnt1 tumor growth was comparable, but not additive, to the effect observed with anti-SDF1, indicative of overlapping mechanisms of inhibition. In contrast, Her2 tumors were not affected by the depletion of Gr1(+) cells.\nWe demonstrated that SDF1 is important for Wnt1, but not for HER2, in inducing murine mammary tumor and the role of SDF1 in tumorigenesis involves Gr1(+) myeloid cells to facilitate growth and/or angiogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2010-01-21", "authors": ["Bob YLiu", "IrinaSoloviev", "PeterChang", "JohnLee", "XiaoDongHuang", "CuilingZhong", "NapoleoneFerrara", "PaulPolakis", "ChieSakanaka"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008611"}

Compared to injection of soluble VEGF, these matrices delivered sustained in vivo levels of VEGF over 2 weeks as the matrix degraded. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, degradable constructs containing VEGF and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide induced a significant number of vessels to grow into the implant at 2 weeks with increasing vessel density at 4 weeks.

Aberrant expression of transcription factors, which has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of several types of cancers, may provide a mechanism that induces the expression of growth and angiogenic factors in tumors, leading to their local increase in the tumor microenvironment, favoring tumor progression. In this report, we demonstrate that the transcription factor HOXB9 is overexpressed in breast carcinoma, where elevated expression correlates with high tumor grade. HOXB9 induces the expression of several angiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, and ANGPTL-2), as well as ErbB (amphiregulin, epiregulin, and neuregulins) and TGF-ss, which activate their respective pathways, leading to increased cell motility and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes. In vivo, HOXB9 promotes the formation of large, well-vascularized tumors that metastasize to the lung.

Adipose formation occurs in a coordinated fashion with neovascularization. Previous studies have shown that extracellular matrix-based materials supplemented with factors that stimulate neovascularization promote adipogenesis in a number of animal models. The present study examines the ability of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) delivered from alginate microbeads to induce neovascularization and adipogenesis in type I collagen gels in a vascular pedicle model of adipose tissue engineering. FGF-1 loaded microbeads stimulated greater vascular network formation in an in vitro 3D co-culture model than a single bolus of FGF-1. In in vivo studies, FGF-1 loaded beads suspended in collagen and implanted in a chamber surrounding the exposed femoral pedicle of a rat resulted in a significant increase in vascular density at 1 and 6 weeks in comparison to bolus administration of FGF-1. Staining for smooth muscle actin showed that over 48% of vessels had associated mural cells. While an increase in neovascularization was achieved, there was less than 3% adipose under any condition. These results show that delivery of FGF-1 from alginate beads stimulated a more persistent neovascularization response than bolus FGF-1 both in vitro and in vivo. However, unlike previous studies, this increased neovascularization did not result in adipogenesis.

Targeted brain regions are highly vascularized, and it remains unknown if DBS electric fields modulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, either through electroporation of individual endothelial cells or electro-permeation of barrier tight junctions. In our study, we calculated the intensities of EF generated around energized Medtronic 3387 and 3389 DBS leads by using a finite element model. Then we designed a novel stimulation system to study the effects of such fields with DBS-relevant waveforms and intensities on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) monolayers, which were used as a basic analog for the blood-brain barrier endothelium. Following 5 min of stimulation, we observed a transient increase in endothelial hydraulic conductivity (Lp) that could be related to the disruption of the tight junctions (TJ) between cells, as suggested by zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein staining. This 'electro-permeation' occurred in the absence of cell death or single cell electroporation, as indicated by propidium iodide staining and cytosolic calcein uptake. Our in vitro results, using uniform fields and BAEC monolayers, thus suggest that electro-permeation of the BBB may occur at electric field intensities below those inducing electroporation and within intensities generated near DBS electrodes. Further studies are necessary to address potential BBB disruption during clinical studies, with safety and efficacy implications.", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "date": "2010-01-16", "authors": ["S VLopez-Quintero", "ADatta", "RAmaya", "MElwassif", "MBikson", "J MTarbell"], "doi": "10.1088/1741-2560/7/1/016005"}

A biphasic calcium phosphate of MGSB was prepared by chemical precipitation method, with a porous spherical morphology. On the basis of the fact that HA plays important roles in bone regeneration and promotes the differentiation, vascularization, and migration of stem cells, HA-cystamine (CYS) hydrogels with cleavable disulfide linkages were prepared to supply HA continuously for effective bone regeneration by their controlled degradation in vivo. Among seven different samples using Bio-OSS\u00ae, MGSB, and/or several kinds of HA hydrogels, MGSB/HA-CYS hydrogels resulted in the most significant bone regeneration in the calvarial critical bone defect of New Zealand white rabbits. Histological and histomorphometric analyses revealed that the bone regeneration by MGSB/HA-CYS hydrogels was as high as 43%, occupying 71% of the bone defect area with MGSB in the form of a calvarial bone plate in 4 weeks. After that, MGSB was bioabsorbed and replaced gradually with regenerated bones as observed in 8 weeks. Synchrotron X-ray imaging clearly confirmed the effective bone regeneration by MGSB/HA-CYS hydrogels, showing three-dimensional micron-scale morphologies of regenerated bones interconnected with MGSB. In addition, sequential nondestructive synchrotron X-ray tomographic analysis results from anterior to posterior of the samples were well matched with the histomorphometric analysis results. The clinically feasible artificial bone substitutes of MGSB/HA-CYS hydrogels will be investigated further for various bone tissue engineering applications using the synchrotron X-ray bioimaging systems.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Although islet blood flow has been studied extensively, little is known about the dynamics of islet blood flow during hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. To investigate changes in islet blood flow as a function of blood glucose level, we clamped blood glucose sequentially at hyperglycemic ( approximately 300 mg/dl or 16.8 mM) and hypoglycemic ( approximately 50 mg/dl or 2.8 mM) levels while simultaneously imaging intraislet blood flow in mouse models that express green fluorescent protein in the beta-cells or yellow fluorescent protein in the alpha-cells. Using line scanning confocal microscopy, in vivo blood flow was assayed after intravenous injection of fluorescent dextran or sulforhodamine-labeled red blood cells. Regardless of the sequence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, islet blood flow is faster during hyperglycemia, and apparent blood volume is greater during hyperglycemia than during hypoglycemia. However, there is no change in the order of perfusion of different islet endocrine cell types in hypoglycemia compared with hyperglycemia, with the islet core of beta-cells usually perfused first. In contrast to the results in islets, there was no significant difference in flow rate in the exocrine pancreas during hyperglycemia compared with hypoglycemia. These results indicate that glucose differentially regulates blood flow in the pancreatic islet vasculature independently of blood flow in the rest of the pancreas.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "CD40 ligand-triggered human dendritic cells mount interleukin-23 responses that are further enhanced by danger signals.", "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-23-specific subunit p19 and the p40 subunit which also constitutes part of IL-12. IL-23 propagates development of Th17 cells, a novel T cell subset which produces IL-17 but no interferon-gamma or IL-4. For both, IL-23 and IL-23-driven IL-17, a crucial role in autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, and colitis is well accepted. Recent studies indicate that there is also a role for IL-23 and IL-17 in tumorigenesis, promoting tumor growth and vascularization, and affecting tumor incidence. We show that human CD14(+) peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), as used for clinical applications in anti-tumor immunization strategies, produce high amounts of IL-23. CD40-triggering of immature and mature DC but not of primary monocytes induced a rapid expression of high levels of IL-23, free p40, and minor levels of IL-12. Upon stimulation of DC subsets with a variety of different danger signals such as single stranded and double stranded RNA, bacterial components or viral infections, IL-23 expression pattern was analyzed. Interestingly, co-stimulation with CD40L enabled IL-23 expression by DC subsets towards danger signals to which they have been unresponsive upon single stimulation. Furthermore, we detected two novel splice variants of the IL-23-specific subunit p19 that could be associated with the regulation of IL-23 expression.

Inhibition of vascularization has been validated by the successful marketing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target specific growth factors or their receptors, but there is considerable room for improvement in existing therapies. Combination of mAbs targeting both the VEGF and PDGF pathways has the potential to increase the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy without the accompanying toxicities of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the inability to combine efficiently with traditional chemotherapeutics. However, development costs and regulatory issues have limited the use of combinatorial approaches for the generation of more efficacious treatments. The concept of mediating disease pathology by targeting two antigens with one therapeutic was proposed over two decades ago. While mAbs are particularly suitable candidates for a dual-targeting approach, engineering bispecificity into one molecule can be difficult due to issues with expression and stability, which play a significant role in manufacturability. Here, we address these issues upstream in the process of developing a bispecific antibody (bsAb). Single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) targeting PDGFRbeta and VEGF-A were selected for superior stability. The scFvs were fused to both termini of human Fc to generate a bispecific, tetravalent molecule. The resulting molecule displays potent activity, binds both targets simultaneously, and is stable in serum.

The mean of each index from four spherical sonobiopsies were compared to those from evaluation of the entire placenta for their degree of correlation and agreement.\nThe mean VI and VFI from the two techniques were similar (13.9 [95% CI 12.3-15.8] versus 14.3 [95% CI 12.1-17.0], p = 0.62 and 6.1 [95% CI 5.2-7.1] versus 6.1 [95% CI 5.0-7.4], p = 0.93, respectively) and significantly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.70 [95% CI 0.60-0.78, p < 0.001] and r = 0.69 [95% CI 0.58-0.77, p < 0.001], respectively). The mean FI from the two techniques were significantly different (44.5 [95% CI 42.9-46.1] versus 41.3 [95% CI 39.6-43.0], p = 0.001), but correlated (r = 0.59 [95% CI 0.46-0.70, p < 0.001]).\nOur findings suggest that placenta vascular indices from sonobiopsy have a good correlation with those from evaluation of the entire placenta. Sonobiopsy may be a valid alternative for evaluation of the placental vascular tree when visualization of the entire placenta is not feasible.

We investigated the necessity of a vascular carrier and mucosal graft when using porous titanium for laryngotracheal reconstruction. Surgical defects of the laryngotracheal complex in 22 rabbits were reconstructed with: (a) porous titanium implanted on a vascularized fascia combined with a buccal mucosal graft (first stage) before transposing to the neck area (second stage); (b) porous titanium implanted on a vascularized fascia (first stage) combined with a mucosal graft (second stage); (c) porous titanium on a pedicled fascia flap; and (d) porous titanium alone. The grafts were tolerated well. Re-epithelialization occurred in all groups. Normal mucosa with a submucosal layer containing vital cells was noted using the titanium implants. Blood vessels were grown in the pores of the titanium scaffold to supply the overlying mucosa. The scaffold was well integrated in the adjacent tracheal cartilage and surrounding tissues, except in the two cases that showed titanium displacement. Inflammation and granulation formation were seen in most rabbits in groups III and IV, initiated probably by the use of buccal mucosal grafts. Reconstruction of a rabbit's trachea using composites of porous titanium, mucosal grafts and a fascia flap is feasible. Titanium seems to meet the requirements needed for closing a small defect of the tracheal wall and allows for re-epithelialization.

The basis of the distinction is that human cancers are known to overexpress facilitative GLUT transporters and TGF-beta1 protein. These proteins are linked to the increased metabolic energy consumption indicating uncontrolled growth and proliferation. We have assayed not only the expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3 and TGF-beta1 proteins, but also the uptake of 2-fluoro-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), a tracer for cancer diagnosis. Western blot analysis and whole body autoradiography were used to measure the 18FDG uptake of tumor cells. Elevated 18FDG uptake was measured in both tumor cell lines. Whole body autoradiography provided evidence that the uptake of 18FDG was lower in the necrotic inner part than in the more vascularized outer parts of primary hepatocarcinoma and mesenchymal renal tumors. GLUT-1 overexpression in hepatocarcinoma tumor, and high levels of GLUT-3 were found in the NeDe cell line and in the mesenchymal renal tumor. TGF-beta-1 was overexpressed in hepatocarcinoma and mesenchymal renal tumors. In vitro and in vivo parameters support the view that the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells cannot be determined by the expression of a single parameter such as the expression of either GLUT-1, GLUT-3 or 18FDG uptake. Besides the tumorigenic potential of the hepatocarcinoma, the high metabolic activity of the renal tumor indicated by its 18FDG uptake, GLUT-3 and TGF-beta1 expression, the mesenchymal renal tumor induced by N-nitroso-dimethylamine is not a benign, but an an aggressive renal carcinoma.", "journal": "Histology and histopathology", "date": "2010-01-08", "authors": ["GyorgyTrencsenyi", "TamasJuhasz", "FruzsinaBako", "TerezMarian", "IstvanPocsi", "PalKertai", "JanosHunyadi", "GasparBanfalvi"], "doi": "10.14670/HH-25.309"}
{"title": "Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by the matrix metalloproteinase-activated anthrax lethal toxin in an orthotopic model of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.", "abstract": "Patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) typically succumb to their disease months after diagnosis despite aggressive therapy. A large percentage of ATCs have been shown to harbor the V600E B-Raf point mutation, leading to the constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. ATC invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis are in part dependent on the gelatinase class of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). The explicit targeting of these two tumor markers may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ATC. The MMP-activated anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a novel recombinant protein toxin combination, shows potent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition in gelatinase-expressing V600E B-Raf tumor cells in vitro. However, preliminary in vivo studies showed that the MMP-activated LeTx also exhibited dramatic antitumor activity against xenografts that did not show significant antiproliferative responses to the LeTx in vitro. Here, we show that the MMP-activated LeTx inhibits orthotopic ATC xenograft progression in both toxin-sensitive and toxin-resistant ATC cells via reduced endothelial cell recruitment and subsequent tumor vascularization. This in turn translates to an improved long-term survival that is comparable with that produced by the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Our results also indicate that therapy with the MMP-activated LeTx is extremely effective against advanced tumors with well-established vascular networks. Taken together, these results suggest that the MMP-activated LeTx-mediated endothelial cell targeting is the primary in vivo antitumor mechanism of this novel toxin. Therefore, the MMP-activated LeTx could be used not only in the clinical management of V600E B-Raf ATC but potentially in any solid tumor.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2010-01-08", "authors": ["Randall WAlfano", "Stephen HLeppla", "ShihuiLiu", "Thomas HBugge", "Janelle MOrtiz", "Terry CLairmore", "Nicholas SDuesbery", "Ian CMitchell", "FiemuNwariaku", "Arthur EFrankel"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0694"}

{"title": "Collagen glycation alters neovascularization in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Microvascular network formation is required for the success of many therapies in regenerative medicine. The process of vessel assembly is fundamentally altered, however, in many people within the potential patient population, including the elderly and people with diabetes. Significant research has been performed to determine how cellular dysfunction contributes to this inadequate neovascularization, but alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) may also influence this process. Glycation of ECM proteins, specifically type I collagen, increases as people age and is accelerated due to uncontrolled diabetes. This glycation results in increased ECM stiffness and resistance to degradation. The goal of this research is to determine whether collagen glycation consistent with changes in aged (defined as people older than 80 years old) and diabetic individuals influences neovascularization. Collagen gels that were incubated in glucose-6-phopshate (G6P) for varying times exhibited cross-linking (26.2+/-8.1% and 31.3+/-5.6% for incubation in 375 mM G6P for 5 and 8 days, respectively), autofluorescence, and advanced glycation end product levels (666+/-481 and 2122+/-501 pmol/mg protein for 5 and 8 days of 375 mM G6P, respectively) consistent with aged and diabetic populations. Three-dimensional culture models showed that sprouting angiogenesis was delayed in collagen gels with high levels of glycation. When implanted in vivo, glycated gels were degraded (44.4+/-4.2% and 49.5+/-11.7% nondegraded gel remaining for gels incubated for 5 and 8 days in 375 mM G6P, respectively) and vascularized (75.5+/-32.0 and 73.7+/-23.6 vessels/mm(2)) more slowly than controls (22.3+/-9.9% gel remaining and 133.3+/-31.0 vessels/mm(2)).

In this study, a novel APA microcapsule embedded with three-dimensional fibrous scaffolds (called APA-FS) was proposed to eliminate cellular necrosis by regulating cells to form multi-small spheroids. HepG2 cells were embedded within the APA-FS to form spheroids and the state of these spheroids was evaluated via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide assay, glucose/lactate metabolism, live/dead staining, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Comparing with the conventional APA microcapsules, the cells within APA-FS organized into multi-small spheroids. The size of these spheroids depended on the concentration of fibrous scaffolds embedded within the microcapsules. In the APA-FS embedded with 5% (v/v) fibrous scaffolds, the average size of cellular spheroids was controlled below 100 microm and the cellular viability was increased by 50% than the control. The results of live/dead staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the improved cellular viability might be attributed to the decreased necrosis in the core of these spheroids.

Since endothelial cells (EC) are the first graft cells encountered by activated host lymphocytes, it is important to delineate the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the interaction of EC with activated T cells. Here, the interaction of CD8(+) T cells with Ag-presenting EC in vivo was examined using a transgenic heart transplantation model with beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) expression exclusively in EC (Tie2-LacZ hearts). We found that priming with beta-gal peptide-loaded DC failed to generate a strong systemic IFN-gamma response, but elicited pronounced TV in both IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-competent, and ifngr(-/-) Tie2-LacZ hearts. In contrast, stimulation of EC-specific CD8(+) T cells with beta-gal-recombinant mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV-LacZ) in recipients of ifngr(+/+) Tie2-LacZ hearts did not precipitate significant TV. However, MCMV-LacZ infection of recipients of ifngr(-/-) Tie2-LacZ hearts led to massive activation of beta-gal-specific CD8 T cells, and led to development of fulminant TV. Further analyses revealed that the strong systemic IFN-gamma \"storm\" associated with MCMV infection induced upregulation of programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) on EC, and subsequent attenuation of programmed death-1 (PD-1)-expressing EC-specific CD8(+) T cells.

{"title": "Nanomaterial standards for efficacy and toxicity assessment.", "abstract": "Decreased toxicity via selective delivery of cancer therapeutics to tumors has become a hallmark achievement of nanotechnology. In order to be optimally efficacious, a systemically administered nanomedicine must reach cancer cells in sufficient quantities to elicit a response and assume its active form within the tumor microenvironment (e.g., be taken up by cancer cells and release a toxic component once within the cytosol or nuclei). Most nanomedicines achieve selective tumor accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or a combination of the EPR effect and active targeting to cellular receptors. Here, we review how the fundamental physicochemical properties of a nanomedicine (its size, charge, hydrophobicity, etc.) can dramatically affect its distribution to cancerous tissue, transport across vascular walls, and retention in tumors. We also discuss how nanoparticle characteristics such as stability in the blood and tumor, cleavability of covalently bound components, cancer cell uptake, and cytotoxicity contribute to efficacy once the nanoparticle has reached the tumor's interstitial space. We elaborate on how tumor vascularization and receptor expression vary depending on cancer type, stage of disease, site of implantation, and host species, and review studies which have demonstrated that these variations affect tumor response to nanomedicines. Finally, we show how knowledge of these properties (both of the nanoparticle and the cancer/tumor under study) can be used to design meaningful in vivo tests to evaluate nanoparticle efficacy.", "journal": "Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

{"title": "The multifunctional choroid.", "abstract": "The choroid of the eye is primarily a vascular structure supplying the outer retina. It has several unusual features: It contains large membrane-lined lacunae, which, at least in birds, function as part of the lymphatic drainage of the eye and which can change their volume dramatically, thereby changing the thickness of the choroid as much as four-fold over a few days (much less in primates). It contains non-vascular smooth muscle cells, especially behind the fovea, the contraction of which may thin the choroid, thereby opposing the thickening caused by expansion of the lacunae. It has intrinsic choroidal neurons, also mostly behind the central retina, which may control these muscles and may modulate choroidal blood flow as well. These neurons receive sympathetic, parasympathetic and nitrergic innervation. The choroid has several functions: Its vasculature is the major supply for the outer retina; impairment of the flow of oxygen from choroid to retina may cause Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The choroidal blood flow, which is as great as in any other organ, may also cool and warm the retina. In addition to its vascular functions, the choroid contains secretory cells, probably involved in modulation of vascularization and in growth of the sclera. Finally, the dramatic changes in choroidal thickness move the retina forward and back, bringing the photoreceptors into the plane of focus, a function demonstrated by the thinning of the choroid that occurs when the focal plane is moved back by the wearing of negative lenses, and, conversely, by the thickening that occurs when positive lenses are worn. In addition to focusing the eye, more slowly than accommodation and more quickly than emmetropization, we argue that the choroidal thickness changes also are correlated with changes in the growth of the sclera, and hence of the eye. Because transient increases in choroidal thickness are followed by a prolonged decrease in synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules and a slowing of ocular elongation, and attempts to decouple the choroidal and scleral changes have largely failed, it seems that the thickening of the choroid may be mechanistically linked to the scleral synthesis of macromolecules, and thus may play an important role in the homeostatic control of eye growth, and, consequently, in the etiology of myopia and hyperopia.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2010-01-02", "authors": ["Debora LNickla", "JoshWallman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.12.002"}

Targeting preadipocyte to adipocyte conversion may be an effective approach to regulate adipose mass. Using differential screening we identified Fstl1, a secreted glycoprotein with roles in immunomodulation, cell growth, cardioprotection, and vascularization, as a \"preadipokine\". Fstl1 is highly expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and dramatically downregulated early in their differentiation to adipocytes. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues reveals white adipose tissue (WAT), lung and heart as primary sites of Fstl1 transcript expression. In WAT, Fstl1 transcript is restricted to the preadipocyte-containing stromal-vascular cell population. Time course studies in multiple adipogenesis models reveal downregulation of Fstl1 is a hallmark of white and brown adipocyte conversion. By Western blot, we show culture media of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes contains high levels of Fstl1 protein that rapidly decline in adipocyte conversion. Moreover, we observe a correlation between preadipocyte phenotype and Fstl1 expression in that TNFalpha-mediated de-differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes is accompanied by re-expression of Fstl1 transcript and protein. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a panel of 18 hormones and other agents revealed the demethylating agent 5-aza-cytidine decreases Fstl1 transcript and protein levels by approximately 90%. Furthermore, of 10 additional preadipocyte-expressed genes analyzed we find Pref-1, Col1A1, Sca-1/Ly6a, Lox and Thbs2, are also downregulated by 5-aza-cytidine. Using luciferase reporter constructs containing 791 or 3922 bp of the Fstl1 5' flanking region, we determine negative transcriptional regulation by Kruppel-like factor 15.

{"title": "VEGF and pleiotrophin modulate the immune profile of breast cancer.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the sprouting of the existing vascular network to form new vessels, is required for the growth of solid tumors. For this reason, the primary stimulant of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), is an attractive target for tumor therapy. In fact, there are currently numerous anti-VEGF therapies in clinical development for the treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer. VEGF signals through two primary VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGFR2 is the primary angiogenic receptor, and VEGFR1 has been implicated in macrophage chemotaxis and tumor cell survival and invasion. It has only been appreciated recently that the VEGFRs are expressed not only on endothelial cells and tumor cells but also on many host immune cells. Therefore, to better understand the effects of anti-VEGF therapy it is important to consider the effects of VEGF on all cells in the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells. Bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae, Genetech), which binds VEGF and inhibits interaction with VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, was approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/NEU-negative breast cancer in 2008, however, the majority of human mammary tumors are either innately resistant or will acquire resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. This suggests that these tumors activate alternate angiogenesis pathways. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an important angiogenic cytokine in breast cancer and is expressed at high levels in approximately 60% of human breast tumors. PTN functions as an angiogenic factor and promotes remodeling of the tumor microenvironment as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, PTN can have profound effects on macrophage phenotype. The present review focuses on the functions of VEGF and PTN on immune cell infiltration and function in breast cancer. Furthermore, we will discuss how anti-VEGF therapy modulates the immune cell profile.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["Kristi DLynn", "Christina LRoland", "Rolf ABrekken"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers2020970\n10.1186/bcr1746\n10.1056/NEJM197108122850711\n10.1200/JCO.2002.10.088\n10.1177/1534735405282557\n10.1182/blood.V97.3.785\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0040186\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3086\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5287\n10.1093/jnci/djk031\n10.1023/A:1009049932252\n10.1159/000041024\n10.1097/00007890-199504150-00015\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1684\n10.1186/bcr1679\n10.1189/jlb.0307164\n10.1182/blood-2002-11-3423\n10.1182/blood-2005-08-3182\n10.1007/s12026-009-8109-6\n10.4161/cc.6.23.5090\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(199611)31:3<283::AID-NEU2>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1016/S0006-291X(05)81267-7\n10.3109/08977199409010982\n10.1016/0006-291X(89)92715-0\n10.1073/pnas.0607299103\n10.1007/BF00666163\n10.1038/nature00821\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08448.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69446-4\n10.1016/j.juro.2007.07.030\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.01.006\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04964.x\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.1038/nature04186\n10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.11.2009\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.003\n10.1023/B:JURE.0000021387.92378.2e\n10.1002/jcp.21313\n10.1038/nrc1256\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1278\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00607.x\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603240\n10.1016/j.molonc.2007.10.003\n10.1023/A:1020304003704\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1823\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6705\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0280\n10.1002/ijc.22217\n10.1002/ijc.22937\n10.1182/blood-2008-02-133751\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000222017.05085.8e\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.06.010\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6229\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.08.031\n10.1038/nbt1323\n10.1038/nature06348\n10.1038/35036374\n10.1073/pnas.0601807103\n10.1038/labinvest.3700053\n10.1111/j.1478-3231.2004.0990.x\n10.1038/nri1498\n10.1038/nm1096-1096\n10.1182/blood-2007-01-065714\n10.1007/s00262-006-0234-7\n10.1007/s00262-007-0441-x\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0409\n10.1182/blood-2007-02-075945\n10.1084/jem.193.11.1303\n10.1080/02841860701233443\n10.1007/BF02303745\n10.1038/cmi.2009.2\n10.1038/nm1749\n10.1007/s12094-009-0368-0\n10.1200/JCO.2005.05.098\n10.1056/NEJMoa072113\n10.1200/JCO.2008.16.1612\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1332\n10.1172/JCI114322"}

Exudative, or \"wet\", AMD is a late form of AMD (as distinguished from atrophic, so-called dry, AMD) and is responsible for over 60% of all cases of blindness due to AMD. It is widely accepted that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key component in the pathogenesis of choroidal neo-vascularization (CNV), which is a precursor to wet AMD. The current gold-standard for treating wet AMD is the monoclonal antibody fragment ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis), which targets VEGF. Other agents used to treat wet AMD include pegaptanib (Macugen), bevacizumab (Avastin; off-label use), and several other experimental agents. The advent of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has presented a whole new approach to inhibiting VEGF. This article reviews the status of a novel siRNA-based therapeutic, bevasiranib, for the treatment of wet AMD. Bevasiranib is believed to work by down regulating VEGF production in the retina. Studies in human cell-lines and animal models have shown that VEGF siRNAs are effective in inhibiting VEGF production.

Functional assessment following anatomic site restoration focused on the quality of feeding and deglutition.\nThe anatomical success rate was 94.63% (5 complete necroses out of 93 flaps). Results were considered to be good (normal or close to normal function for feeding and deglutition) in the majority of patients (83% at 6 months, 91% at 18 months). On the donor site: Functional sequelae were moderate when post-operative reeducation was correctly performed.\nVascularized free scapular flap bone graft is very interesting for the reconstruction of mandibular discontinuity, composite (soft tissue and cutaneous resection) or exclusively osseous defects (not in excess of 13 cm), secondary to oncologic or osteoradionecrotic resections.", "journal": "Revue de laryngologie - otologie - rhinologie", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["M YLouis", "J PRame", "DDe Raucourt", "H AbouMayaleh"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Water transport across biological membranes: Overton, water channels, and peritoneal dialysis.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis involves diffusive and convective transports and osmosis through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) corresponds to the ultrasmall pore predicted by the modelization of peritoneal transport. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that upregulation of the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries is reflected by increased water permeability and ultrafiltration, without affecting the osmotic gradient and the permeability for small solutes. Inversely, studies in Aqp1 mice have shown that haplo-insufficiency in AQP1 is reflected by significant attenuation of water transport. Recent studies have identified lead compounds that could act as agonists of aquaporins, as well as putative binding sites and potential mechanisms of gating the water channel. By modulating water transport, these pharmacological agents could have clinically relevant effects in targeting specific tissues or disease states. These studies on the peritoneal membrane also provide an experimental framework to investigate the role of water channels in the endothelium and various cell types.", "journal": "Bulletin et memoires de l'Academie royale de medecine de Belgique", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["ODevuyst"], "doi": null}

For example, design considerations such as porosity, pore shape, and interconnection play significant roles in determining graft performance. The effective delivery of bone morphogenetic proteins and the ability to restore vascularization also play significant roles in determining the success of a bone graft material.

However, especially in tissues with clinically relevant sizes, the mass transport of nutrients into the tissue is often insufficient to sustain all the cells within the tissue. This is not only the case during in vitro culture. After implantation of an engineered tissue, a vascular network is not directly established. Therefore, the mass transport of nutrients is also critical during the initial period after implantation. This review introduces the basics of mass transport, leading to the conclusion that three main concepts can be used to increase nutrient supply in tissue engineering. These are; increasing the overall diffusion coefficient, decreasing the diffusion distance, or increasing convective transport. Based on these concepts, the main strategies that have been developed to enhance the supply of nutrients to cells in engineered tissues will be discussed.", "journal": "Biotechnology & genetic engineering reviews", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["JeroenRouwkema", "BartoKoopman", "ClemensBlitterswijk", "WouterDhert", "JosMalda"], "doi": "10.5661/bger-26-163"}

No consensus in the literature was found on how thrombosis could best be prevented. The Dutch Head and Neck Cancer Centers use routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent thrombosis in the anastomosis. It was also concluded that non-pharmacologic measures for preventing thrombosis, such as meticulous microvascular surgery and smoking cessation prior to the operation, are thought to play an important role in the prevention of thrombosis in microvascular free-flap reconstructions. It has not been determined which pre- and postoperative pharmacologic measure can prevent thrombosis most effectively.

{"title": "The expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in ovarian follicles throughout the estrous cycle in the ewe.", "abstract": "Healthy follicles are highly vascularized whereas those undergoing atresia have poor vascularity, suggesting a relationship between follicular vascularization and follicular function. Vascularization is regulated by angiogenic factors, and among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-Tie (Ang-Tie) systems are of central importance. The objectives of this study were to determine if VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and components of the Ang-Tie system are expressed in ovarian follicles at both the protein and mRNA levels and to explore if their expression is related to the stage of the estrous cycle in the ewe. Ovaries from cyclic ewes were collected during the luteal phase (n=5) or before (n=5), during (n=4), and after (n=4) the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. After fixation, ovaries were wax-embedded, serially sectioned, and analyzed for both protein and mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2. mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled ovine riboprobes. A similar pattern of expression was observed for mRNA and protein for all of the factors. Both mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2 in the granulosa and theca cells of follicles >or=2mm in diameter was significantly different among the stages of the estrous cycle, with the highest expression detected at the post-LH surge stage. Theca cells expressed significantly greater levels of the six angiogenic factors compared with granulosa cells at all stages of the estrous cycle. Expression levels in granulosa and theca cells were comparable between small (2.0 to 2.5mm) and medium (2.5 to 4.0mm) follicles, but large follicles (>4.0mm) expressed higher mRNA and protein levels (all P<0.05) for all factors at all stages of the estrous cycle. These data show (i) that VEGF, VEGFR-2, and the Ang-Tie system are present in both granulosa and theca cells of the ovarian follicle, (ii) that thecal cells consistently express greater levels of all of these factors compared with granulosa cells, and (iii) that their levels of expression are related to the stage of the estrous cycle and to follicle size.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["M W HChowdhury", "R JScaramuzzi", "C P DWheeler-Jones", "MKhalid"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.10.011"}
{"title": "High-throughput flow cytometry purification of transduced progenitors expressing defined levels of vascular endothelial growth factor induces controlled angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Delivery of therapeutic genes by genetically modified progenitors is a powerful tool for regenerative medicine. However, many proteins remain localized within or around the expressing cell, and heterogeneous expression levels can lead to reduced efficacy or increased toxicity. For example, the matrix-binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can induce normal, stable, and functional angiogenesis or aberrant angioma growth depending on its level of expression in the microenvironment around each producing cell, and not on its total dose. To overcome this limitation, we developed a flow cytometry-based method to rapidly purify transduced cells expressing desired levels of a therapeutic transgene. Primary mouse myoblasts were transduced with a bicistronic retrovirus expressing VEGF linked to a nonfunctional, truncated form of the syngenic molecule CD8a. By using a clonal population uniformly expressing a known VEGF level as a reference, cells producing similar VEGF amounts were rapidly sorted from the primary population on the basis of their CD8a fluorescence intensity. A single round of sorting with a suitably designed gate yielded a purified population that induced robust, normal, and stable angiogenesis, and completely avoided angioma growth, which was instead always caused by the heterogeneous parent population. This clinically applicable high-throughput technique allowed the delivery of highly controlled VEGF levels in vivo, leading to significantly improved safety without compromising efficacy. Furthermore, when applied to other suitable progenitor populations, this technique could help overcome a significant obstacle in the development of safe and efficacious vascularization strategies in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2009-12-30", "authors": ["HeidiMisteli", "ThomasWolff", "PhilippF\u00fcglistaler", "RobertoGianni-Barrera", "LorenzG\u00fcrke", "MichaelHeberer", "AndreaBanfi"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.291"}

This paper will be a review defect classification, goals of reconstruction, the various donor sites, dental rehabilitation, new advances, and persistent problems. Reconstruction of segmental mandibular defects after ablative surgery is best accomplished using free tissue transfer to restore mandibular continuity and function. Reestablishing occlusion and optimizing tongue mobility are important to post-operative oral function. Persistent problems in oro-mandibular reconstruction relate to the effects of radiation treatment on the native tissue and include xerostomia, dysgeusia, osteoradionecrosis and trismus.

{"title": "VEGF-A expression by HSV-1-infected cells drives corneal lymphangiogenesis.", "abstract": "Inflammatory lymphangiogenesis plays a crucial role in the development of inflammation and transplant rejection. The mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis during bacterial infection, toll-like receptor ligand administration, and wound healing are well characterized and depend on ligands for the vascular endothelial grow factor receptor (VEGFR) 3 that are produced by infiltrating macrophages. But inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in nonlymphoid tissues during chronic viral infection is unstudied. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection of the cornea is a leading cause of blindness and depends on aberrant host immune responses to antigen within the normally immunologically privileged cornea. We report that corneal HSV-1 infection drives lymphangiogenesis and that corneal lymphatics persist past the resolution of infection. The mechanism of HSV-1-induced lymphangiogenesis was distinct from the described mechanisms of inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. HSV-1-elicited lymphangiogenesis was strictly dependent on VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling but not on VEGFR-3 ligands.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical study of the vaginal inflammatory response in experimental trichomoniasis.", "abstract": "In the present paper, the acute and subchronical inflammatory processes of the vaginal epithelial were studied in mice experimentally infected with two Trichomonas vaginalis strains of different pathogenicity, by means of histological and immunological methods. There was an increase in the stratified epithelium layers as well as edema produced by the increase of vascularization in the propia submucosa and infiltration of leukocytes. The proliferation of the vaginal epithelium favors the settlement and persistence of the parasitic infection. All of the findings corresponded with signs of a systemic disease being observed in the animals, including significant weight loss and also intestinal invasion. The entire inflammatory process has been corroborated by studies of adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin, VCAM-1 and PECAM-1. A correlation between the time of appearance and the perseverance of the inflammatory process with E-Selectin and VCAM-1 expression was observed, but not with PECAM-1. The strain with a higher pathogenicity was able to invade deep vaginal tissues and thus, parasites could not be detected by vaginal washings. This may be an important cause of diagnosis and treatment failure. Also, by the different localization of trichomonads, it appeared that the battle between host and parasite took place in different areas dependent upon the characteristics of the strain.", "journal": "Acta tropica", "date": "2009-12-23", "authors": ["AEscario", "AG\u00f3mez Barrio", "BSimons Diez", "J AEscario"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.12.002"}
{"title": "Deficiency for the cysteine protease cathepsin L promotes tumor progression in mouse epidermis.", "abstract": "To define a functional role for the endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) during squamous carcinogenesis, we generated mice harboring a constitutive Ctsl deficiency in addition to epithelial expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 oncogenes (human cytokeratin 14 (K14)-HPV16). We found enhanced tumor progression and metastasis in the absence of Ctsl. As tumor progression in K14-HPV16 mice is dependent on inflammation and angiogenesis, we examined immune cell infiltration and vascularization without finding any effect of the Ctsl genotype. In contrast, keratinocyte-specific transgenic expression of cathepsin V, the human orthologue of mouse Ctsl, in otherwise Ctsl-deficient K14-HPV16 mice restored the phenotype observed in the control HPV16 skin. To better understand this phenotype at the molecular level, we measured several oncogenic signal transduction pathways in primary keratinocytes on stimulation with keratinocyte-conditioned cell culture medium. We found increased activation of protein kinase B/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in protease-deficient cells, especially if treated with media conditioned by Ctsl-deficient keratinocytes. Similarly, the level of active GTP-Ras was increased in Ctsl-deficient epidermis. We conclude that Ctsl is critical for the termination of growth factor signaling in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of keratinocytes and, therefore, functions as an anti-tumor protease.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2009-12-22", "authors": ["JDennem\u00e4rker", "TLohm\u00fcller", "JMayerle", "MTacke", "M MLerch", "L MCoussens", "CPeters", "TReinheckel"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2009.466"}
{"title": "Neuroproteomics", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury is a major clinical and public health challenge. Although a common and increasingly prevalent wartime condition (1), injury to peripheral nerves, plexuses, and roots is present in 5% of patients seen in civilian trauma centers (2). In one study, almost half of peripheral nerve injuries at trauma centers were due to motor vehicle accidents and about half required surgery (3). Peripheral nerve injuries can substantially impact quality of life through loss of function and increased risk of secondary disabilities from falls, fractures, and other injuries (2). Neurons are connected in intricate communication networks established during development to convey sensory information from peripheral receptors of sensory neurons to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), and to convey commands from the central nervous system to effector organs such as skeletal muscle innervated by motor neurons. The peripheral nerve environment is quite complex, consisting of axonal projections from neurons, supporting cells such as Schwann cells and fibroblasts, and the blood supply to the nerve. Connective tissue known as endoneurium surrounds peripheral nerve axons. Within peripheral nerves, axons are grouped into fascicles surrounded by connective tissue known as perineurium. Between and surrounding groups of fascicles is the epineurium. Microvessel plexuses course longitudinally through the epineurium and send branches through the perineurium to form a vascular network of capillaries in the endoneurium (4). The primary supporting cell for peripheral nerves is the Schwann cell. Schwann cells wrap around axons in a spiral fashion multiple times and their plasma membranes form a lipid-rich tubular cover around the axon known as the myelin sheath or the neurilemma. Schwann cells and the myelin sheath support and maintain axons and help to guide axons during axonal regeneration following nerve injury (5). It has been known for quite some time that regenerating axons exhibit a strong preference for growing along the inside portion of remaining basal lamina tubes in the distal nerve stump, the well-characterized \u201cbands of Bungner\u201d (6\u201310). Schwann cells originally associated with myelinated axons form such bands all the way from the transection site to the distal end organ target. The critical concept here is that the eventual distal destination of regenerating axons is largely determined by the Schwann cell tubes as they enter at the nerve transection site (9,11,12). Recent elegant work with transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins in their axons has verified that most (but not all) regenerating axons distal to either a crush or a transection injury remain within a single Schwann cell band as they grow within the distal nerve stump (13,14). Within the motor system it has even been shown that the same axon predominantly reinnervates the same neuromuscular junctions, and that Schwann cell bands act as mechanical barriers to direct axon outgrowth (13). The neuronal cell body is the site of synthesis of virtually all proteins and organelles in the cell. A complex process known as anterograde transport continuously moves materials from the neuronal cell body via the axon to its terminal synapse. These transported substances include neurotransmitters that facilitate communications between the neuron and end organ tissue across a narrow extracellular space known as the synaptic cleft (5) or, as in the case of the motor neuron innervation of muscle, the neuromuscular junction (15). Conversely, end organs such as muscle produce substances that act as nerve growth factors. These make their way across the neuromuscular junction to the innervating motor neuron axon (16). Some of these substances, or chemical messengers induced by them, are packaged and conveyed by retrograde transport from the synapse via the axon to the neuronal cell body. In this manner, the neuron and its end organ are continuously informed about the status of the connection between them. It has been suggested that information from end organs takes the form of factors that sustain existing nerve cell connections and promote the regeneration of damaged nerve cells. For instance, it has long been known that muscle exerts a strong influence on developing and regenerating motor neurons, and we have recently shown that even within an individual muscle there are factors that can influence the accuracy of reinnervation (17). Recent work has elegantly shown that if a single muscle fiber is selectively lesioned, the motor neuron axon terminal making up the proximal side of the neuromuscular junction rapidly atrophies and withdraws from the muscle postsynaptic sites within a matter of hours (18). The clinical significance, prognosis, and treatment of peripheral nerve injury depend on the site and extent of the injury. Despite regeneration, extensive peripheral nerve injuries can result in the effective paralysis of the entire limb or distal portions of the limb. Two peripheral nerve injury classification schemes, the Seddon (19) and the Sunderland (20), are in common use. These classify nerve injury according to whether the injury was confined to demyelination only or a more severe disruption of axons and supporting connective tissue. According to Seddon, the most severe injuries are classified as axonotmesis and neurotmesis. Axonotmesis is a nerve injury characterized by axon disruption rather than destruction of the connective tissue framework. The connective tissue and Schwann tubes are relatively intact. This is typical of stretch injuries common in falls and motor vehicle accidents. In contrast, neurotmesis involves the disruption of the nerve trunk and the connective tissue structure. This would occur in injuries where the nerve has been completely severed or badly crushed. Prognosis is good in peripheral nerve injuries where endoneurial Schwann cell tubes remain intact. Disruption of the Schwann cell tubes results in the loss of established pathways that regenerating axons follow. For extensive injuries, surgery is usually necessary to remove damaged nerve tissue and join viable nerve ends by direct anastomosis or by a nerve tissue graft (1). Refinement of microsurgical techniques involving the introduction of the surgical microscope and microsutures has increased the accuracy of this mechanical process, yet only 10% of adults will recover normal nerve function using state-of-the-art current techniques (21\u201323). The limits of microsurgical techniques have been reached; this is not surprising given that the finest suture material and needles ( and microns, respectively) are still quite a bit larger than the smallest axons that need to be repaired. The major key to recovery of function following peripheral nerve lesions is the accurate regeneration of axons to their original target end organs. A recognized leader of clinical nerve repair once stated, \u201cThe core of the problem is not promoting axon regeneration, but in getting them back to where they belong\u201d (Sunderland, 1991) (23). At the level of a mixed peripheral nerve where motor and sensory axons are intermixed, correct discriminatory choices for appropriate terminal nerve branches at the lesion site are necessary prerequisites for the subsequent successful reinnervation of appropriate end-organ targets. Motor axons previously innervating muscle may be misdirected to sensory organs, and sensory axons typically innervating skin can be misdirected to muscle. Misdirected regeneration is a major barrier to functional recovery. In order to understand axonal regeneration and the mechanisms that axons use to navigate to target tissues, our laboratory has conducted a series of studies that are now culminating in proteomic investigations to identify specific biochemical mediators that may be the underlying mechanisms that direct accurate axon regeneration. We describe our work and that of others in the development of a model of axonal regeneration in the rodent femoral nerve and what we have learned from it. Then we will lay out our current research direction illustrating how approaches in proteomics such as two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry can be used to identify the underlying mediators that may lead to new therapies for peripheral nerve injury.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2010", "authors": ["OscarAlzate", "Mark W.Massing", "Grant A.Robinson", "Christine E.Marx", "OscarAlzate", "Roger D.Madison"], "doi": null}

The normal anatomy can be distorted because of inflammatory processes and tumors and recurrences. Avoiding injuries to the semicircular canals (SCCs) and facial canal is mandatory, and there is need to find a way to recognize the facial nerve and SCCs for safe performance of mastoidectomy. We describe, as a proof of concept, a novel technique to drill the mastoid while allowing the surgeon to recognize and avoid injuries to vital structures, in the cadaver.\nFour fresh cadaveric heads (8 sides) were prepared by cannulating the major vessels at the level of the neck. After removal of the mastoid cortex, indocyanine green was injected in the vessels. The sigmoid sinus alongside the facial nerve and SCCs was skeletonized using the drilling guidance provided by the fluorescence. The mucosa covering the air cells of the mastoid is very well vascularized compared with the thick bone representing the outer layer of the SCCs and facial canal. Consequently, after the indocyanine green injection, the mucosa shines whereas the bone does not. The fluorescence guides the drilling displaying air cells that are safe to remove.\nEight mastoidectomies were performed, resulting in optimal drilling with no injuries to the facial canal and SCCs.\nWith this novel technique, it is possible to perfectly skeletonize the facial nerve and the SCCs in the cadaver. We think that this technique can be an adjunct in the armamentarium of trainees that are not familiar with the anatomy of the temporal bone and eventually of neurosurgeons facing lesions that require the removal of various degrees of the mastoid.", "journal": "Neurosurgery", "date": "2009-12-22", "authors": ["CristianGragnaniello", "MahmoudKamel", "OssamaAl-Mefty"], "doi": "10.1227/01.NEU.0000360567.15127.C5"}

Hemimandibular bone, masseter muscle, tongue and hemifacial skin flaps were dissected based on the same vascular pedicle of common carotid artery and external jugular vein. The flaps were then transplanted to the recipient inguinal region. Evaluation methods included flap angiography, plain x-ray, computed tomographic scan, and histology.All transplants survived indefinitely and no graft loss was noted. Flap angiography demonstrated intact vascular supply to the bone. Computed tomography scan and bone histology confirmed the viability of the bone components for the composite grafts. Hematoxylin and eosin staining determined the presence of viable bone marrow cells within the transplanted mandible. Viability of the tongue was confirmed by the presence of pink color and bleeding after puncture, as well as by histology.We have introduced a new composite hemiface/mandible/tongue transplant model. The main advantage of this model is the presence of vascularized bone marrow within the mandibular component, which may facilitate future studies on chimerism and tolerance induction.

Clin. Cancer Res. 15(17), 5511-5517 (2009). Novel methods in assessing pancreas cancer vascularization and metabolism are urgently needed for pretherapeutic patient stratification. Recently, noninvasive quantification of blood flow and metabolic activity of pancreatic tumors using [(15)O]H(2)O and [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to assess these parameters. This also implied that high tumor metabolism and low blood flow (and thus probably also low tissue oxygenation) are linked with an aggressive cancer phenotype, and potentially reflect treatment resistance. Furthermore, such functional imaging might prove clinically that pancreatic cancer differs from other gastrointestinal cancer in its desmoplastic reaction and hypovascularity, which might well explain the enormous heterogeneity in treatment sensitivity. Therefore, determination of the metabolism to blood flow ratio could help in the decision on which (additional) chemotherapies or targeted agents to administer to a particular patient.

The definitive treatment of this serious lower extremity injury remains controversial, and the use of large allogeneic bone grafts, vascularized bone grafts, and tibiocalcaneal fusion, as well as reimplantation of the extruded talus have been recommended.", "journal": "The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons", "date": "2009-12-18", "authors": ["HichemMnif", "MakramZrig", "MustaphaKoubaa", "RafikJawahdou", "ImedHammouda", "AbderrazekAbid"], "doi": "10.1053/j.jfas.2009.09.003"}
{"title": "In vitro reconstruction of an autologous, watertight, and resistant vesical equivalent.", "abstract": "Currently, bladder repair is performed using gastrointestinal segments; however, this technique has a high morbidity rate, and new alternatives are thus needed. The lack of native or synthetic tissue with similar properties of the bladder led us to develop autologous vesical substitutes entirely made by tissue engineering and without exogenous matrices. Watertight function and mechanical resistance are fundamental for the model. The aim of this study was to determine the structural and functional characteristics of our vesical equivalent (VE).\nPorcine VEs are produced in 55 days. The cellular types that make up the vesical wall are extracted and purified simultaneously from a small porcine bladder biopsy. Dermal fibroblasts are extracted and cultured in vitro to form cellular sheets. Endothelial cells were seeded on the fibroblast sheets before their superimposition. Urothelial cells are then seeded onto this cellular construction. VEs are characterized by histology, immunostaining, electron microscopy, and cell viability. Mechanical properties of the reconstructed substitutes are evaluated by uniaxial tensile tests, and tissue absorption is verified with (14)C-urea, which quantifies the degree of impermeability.\nThis process allowed us to obtain a highly structured tissue with a total fusion of the fibroblast layers. As expected, histological observations showed a pseudostratification of the urothelium developing on an organized self-secreted extracellular matrix. Positive markers for cytokeratin 8/18 in immunostaining confirmed the presence of a urinary epithelium. Electron microscopy confirmed the normal aspect of urothelial cells. Our VE's permeability to (14)C-urea was significantly similar to porcine bladder, and characterization of the mechanical properties indicated that our tissue could be suitable for grafting since its ultimate tensile strength compares favorably with a native porcine bladder.\nThe construction of a VE using this method seems very promising in meeting the needs in the urological field. Our substitute has proven its efficiency as a barrier to urea and has a sufficient mechanical resistance to support suturing. Additionally, this model is completely autologous, and its possible endothelialization could promote the early vascularization process after grafting and thus significantly reducing inflammation and possible rejection.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Graft vascularization is a critical rate-limiting step in skeletal stem cell-mediated posterolateral spinal fusion.", "abstract": "The ability of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) to direct spinal fusion (SF) upon transplantation in conjunction with osteoconductive biomaterials was investigated in a rabbit model. When tested in a mouse heterotopic transplantation assay, rabbit SSCs and Pro-Osteon 500R was osteoconductive and supported osteogenesis. When used in a SF model, the same constructs induced bone formation in periapophyseal regions (PARs). In this respect, they proved to be superior to grafts of cell-free carrier or total uncultured bone marrow-carrier constructs, used as controls. However, interapophyseal regions (IARs) remained devoid of new bone, such that true bony bridging of adjacent transverse apophyses (true SF) could not be achieved. Interestingly, this could not be predicted from high-resolution radiography. A systematic histological survey of the entire graft harvested at 6 months was essential for proper assessment of the transplantation procedure outcome. Immunohistochemical analysis of microvessel density revealed that IARs remained undervascularized, as compared to PARs, suggesting that differential vascularization could account for the absence or presence of new bone formation in the same regions. SF is an extreme model of stem cell-directed bone regeneration, requiring a combination of orthotopic (PAR) and heterotopic (IAR) bone formation. Our data show that, in this setting, graft size can be critical with respect to the necessary neovascularization, a crucial variable independent of proper osteogenic and osteoconductive competence of the cells and materials employed. Furthermore, stringent histological studies are mandatory for proper assessment of outcomes in SF studies, in which the use of mineralized materials can make radiographic assessment misleading.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["GiuseppeGiannicola", "EmilianoFerrari", "GennaroCitro", "BenedettoSacchetti", "AlessandroCorsi", "MaraRiminucci", "GianlucaCinotti", "PaoloBianco"], "doi": "10.1002/term.238"}

In this study, a modified arteriovenous loop (AVL) model was developed to prefabricate an axial vascularized tissue-engineered coral bone. In group A (n = 28), an arteriovenous fistula between rabbit femoral artery and vein was anastomosed to form an AVL. The AVL was placed in a coral block (6 x 8 x 10 mm (3)) as a vascular carrier. The complex was wrapped with polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and implanted subcutaneously. In group B (n = 20), there was no vascular carrier, and the same dimensional coral was directly implanted beneath inguinal skin. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, the rabbits were perfused with heparinized saline (for scanning electron microscopy), India ink (for histological examination), and ethylene perchloride (for vascular casts) via the abdominal aorta. In group A, histology showed that newly formed vasculature extended over the surfaces and invaded the entire coral blocks. The vascular density was significantly superior to that in group B. Vascular casts showed that new blood vessels robustly sprouted from the AVL. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that there were minute sprouting cavities in the vascular endangium.

Further, after anastomosis, thrombosis is a major complication arising due to vasoconstriction. Therefore, we decided to apply lidocaine topically on the recipient artery to prevent postoperative vasospasm. We had applied lidocaine topically on the recipient artery in seven patients with persistent vasospasm before the completion of the surgery. After surgery, 0.2 mL lidocaine (4%) was directly applied on the vascularized region every 15 minutes for the first 3 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours, and every 1 hour for the next 18 hours. Although four patients experienced a disturbance in the blood flow immediately after the surgery, they showed improvements after lidocaine application. In three of these four patients, vasospasm was also suspected to occur at 15 minutes after the surgery; however, topical application of lidocaine was found to be effective in these patients. Thrombosis was not observed in any case. We believe that if the site of lidocaine application is appropriate, even a small dose of low-concentration lidocaine (4%) can produce an adequate effect. Moreover, the intervals between lidocaine applications should be carefully considered.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["ToshiyaYokoyama", "YasuyoshiTosa", "KoichKadomatsu", "KaneshigeSato", "YoshiakiHosaka"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0029-1243291"}

In this study, we examined the process of BSP formation in the rhodopsin knockout (rho (-/-)) mouse, a murine model for human RP.\nIn rho (-/-) mice from 2 to 16 months of age, representing the range from early to late stages of degeneration, retinal sections and whole mounts were examined morphologically by light and electron microscopy. The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP.\nAfter the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly. Also, the vascular endothelium developed fenestrations similar to the RPE-choroid interface. In whole mounts, the pigmented cell clusters outlining retinal capillaries correlated well with BSPs in human RP. The structure of the inner retina remained well preserved, even in late stages.\nThe Rho (-/-) mouse is the first animal model that depicts all major pathological changes, even in the late stages of RP. Using the rho (-/-) mouse model we were able to analyze the complete dynamic process of BSP formation. Therefore we conclude that: (1) In rho (-/-) retinas, BSPs only form in areas devoid of photoreceptors; (2) Direct contact between inner retinal vessels and RPE appears to be a major trigger for migration of RPE cells; (3) The distribution of the RPE cells in BSPs reflects the vascular network at the time of formation.

Increased or deregulated activity of these molecules has been linked to cancer and bone-related pathologies. By using novel mouse models to locally increase VEGF levels in the skeleton, we found that embryonic VEGF over-expression in osteo-chondroprogenitors and their progeny largely pheno-copied constitutive beta-catenin activation. Adult induction of VEGF in these cell populations dramatically increased bone mass, associated with aberrant vascularization, bone marrow fibrosis and haematological anomalies. Genetic and pharmacological interventions showed that VEGF increased bone mass through a VEGF receptor 2- and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-mediated pathway inducing beta-catenin transcriptional activity in endothelial and osteoblastic cells, likely through modulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta phosphorylation. These insights into the actions of VEGF in the bone and marrow environment underscore its power as pleiotropic bone anabolic agent but also warn for caution in its therapeutic use.

{"title": "Inhaled insulin-intrapulmonary, intranasal, and other routes of administration: mechanisms of action.", "abstract": "After discovery of insulin as a hypoglycemic agent in 1921 various routes of administration to control blood glucose were attempted. These included subcutaneous, oral, rectal, sublingual, buccal, transdermal, vaginal, intramuscular, intrapulmonary and intranasal delivery systems. While each delivery system controlled hyperglycemia the subcutaneous route was given priority until 2006 when the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first commercially available pulmonary inhaled insulin.\nA review of major publications dealing with intrapulmonary administration of insulin was made to understand the physiological basis for its use, its efficacy in controlling hyperglycemia, its side effects and a comparison of its efficacy with other delivery methods.\nThe large surface area of the lung, its good vascularization, capacity for solute exchange and ultra thin membranes of alveolar epithelia are unique features that facilitate pulmonary insulin delivery. Large lung surface area ( approximately 75 m(2)) and thin alveolar epithelium ( approximately 0.1-0.5 microm) permit rapid drug absorption. First pass metabolism avoids gastrointestinal tract metabolism. Lung drug delivery depends upon a complex of factors including size, shape, density, charge and pH of delivery entity, velocity of entry, quality of aerosol deposition, character of alveoli, binding characteristics of aerosol on the alveolar surface, quality of alveolar capillary bed and its subsequent vascular tree. Many studies were performed to optimize each of these factors using several delivery systems to enhance pulmonary absorption. Availability was about 80% of subcutaneous administration with peak activity within 40-60 min of administration. Intranasal insulin delivery faces a smaller surface area ( approximately 180 cm(2)) with quite different absorption characteristics in nasal epithelium and its associated vasculature. Absorption depends upon many factors including composition and character of nasal mucus. Absorption of intranasal insulin resulted in a faster absorption time course than with subcutaneous insulin.\nAfter many studies the FDA approved Pfizer's product, Exubera, for intrapulmonary insulin delivery. While the system was effective its expense and putative side effects caused the drug company to withdraw the drug from the marketplace.

Microtomography, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy analyses demonstrated the capability of the material processing to create a three-dimensional porous PU scaffold with nHA on the surface. Compared to nHA-free PU scaffolds (control), this modified scaffold type induced a significant increase in in vitro adsorption of model proteins. In vivo analysis of the inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response to implanted nHA/PU scaffolds in the dorsal skinfold chamber model indicated that the incorporation of nHA particles into the scaffold material did not affect biocompatibility and vascularization when compared to control scaffolds.

Twenty biopsy specimens of human thymus, including foetal and adult normal thymus and thymoma were analysed. Double staining with CD34 and mast cell tryptase was used to count both mast cells and microvessels in the same fields. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed to characterize the spatial distribution of MCs and blood vessels in selected specimens. Results demonstrated that MCs were localized exclusively to the medulla. Their number was significantly higher in thymoma specimens as compared with adult and foetal normal specimens respectively. In contrast the microvessel area was unchanged. The analysis of the spatial distribution and relationship between MCs and microvessels revealed that only in the thymoma specimens was there a significant spatial association between MCs and microvessels.

Using microfluidic patterning, it was possible to localize hydrogel-encapsulated HUVECs and MSCs within separate channels spaced at 500, 1000 or 2000 microm. All three MSC populations had similar expression profiles of mesenchymal cell markers and similar capacity for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. However, bone marrow-derived MSCs (but not umbilical vein or artery derived MSCs) showed strong distance-dependent migration toward HUVECs and supported the formation of stable vascular networks resembling capillary-like vasculature.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the mechanical stimuli and the capillary network formation on cell differentiation within a scaffold of irregular morphology. A porous scaffold of calcium phosphate based glass was used. The pores and the solid phase were discretized using micro computed tomography images. Cell activity was simulated within the interconnected pore domain of the scaffold using a lattice modeling approach. Compressive strains of 0.5 and 1% of total deformation were applied and two cases of mesenchymal stem cells initialization (in vitro seeding and in vivo) were simulated. Similar capillary networks were formed independently of the cell initialization mode and the magnitude of the mechanical strain applied. Most of vessels grew in the pores at the periphery of the scaffolds and were blocked by the walls of the scaffold. When 0.5% of strain was applied, 70% of the pore volume was affected by mechano-regulatory stimuli corresponding to bone formation; however, because of the lack of oxygen, only 40% of the volume was filled with osteoblasts. 40% of volume was filled with chondrocytes and 3% with fibroblasts.

The corneal transparency is due, at least in part, to the arrangement in orthogonal lamellae of collagen fibrils, surrounded by proteoglycans (PGs). These PGs regulate fibrilogenesis, the matrix assembly, and ultimately the corneal transparency. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of AMT upon the corneal PGs after severe limbal injury.\nExperiments were performed on the right corneas of 22 New Zealand female albino rabbits, and their left corneas were used as matched controls. These animals were divided into 3 groups: G1 (n=10): total peritomy and keratolimbectomy, followed by application of 0.5 M NaOH; G2 (n=10): submitted to the same trauma as G1, and treated by AMT; G3: no trauma, only AMT (n=2). The right corneas of G2 and G3 were covered by DMSO4 cryopreserved human amniotic membrane, fixed by interrupted 9-0 mononylon sutures, with its stromal face toward the ocular surface. After 7 or 30 days, the corneas were removed and PGs were extracted.\nNormal corneas contained approximately 9 mg of PGs per gram of dry tissue. AMT on intact cornea (G3) did not cause any changes in the concentration of PGs. In contrast, injured corneas contained much less PGs, both on the seventh and on the 30th day posttrauma. The PG concentration was even lower in injured corneas treated by AMT. This decrease was due almost exclusively to dermatan sulfate PGs, and the structure of dermatan sulfate was also modified, indicating changes in the biosynthesis patterns.\nAlthough beneficial effects have been observed on clinical observation and concentration of soluble proteins after AMT, the normal PG composition of cornea was not attained, even 30 days postinjury, indicating that the normal ocular surface reconstruction, if possible, is a long-term process.", "journal": "European journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["Alexandre LAndrade", "Mauro QCampos", "Jos\u00e9 A PGomes", "Alessandra G ABerto", "Yara MMichelacci"], "doi": "10.1177/112067211002000206"}

Grafts were performed with a pool of organ-cultured donor corneas designated for emergency grafting and prepared for immediate use with all safety tests performed. Assignation criteria were corneas with a small superficial stromal opacity but meeting all selection criteria for penetrating keratoplasty tissue and corneas without stromal opacity but an endothelial cell density from 1800 to 2300 cells per square millimeter or mild polymegethism or pleomorphism. Cox multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival, and log rank test were applied.\nAll requests for corneal tissue were honored within 24 hours. Ninety-one patients showed a complete and 60 an imminent perforation. One hundred thirty-one penetrating grafts and 20 lamellar grafts have been used. The globes were saved in 140 of the 151 patients (92.7%). Globe preservation was not significantly related to the absence of penetrating keratoplasty quality of the donor endothelium, the type of grafting, the degree of vascularization in the host cornea, or diabetic disease in the recipient. The main risk factor for globe preservation was the presence of a systemic autoimmune disease in the recipient (P = 0.0021).\nA selected pool of donor corneas designated for emergency grafting, that does not interfere with the scheduled procedures, allows more efficient and safe use of donor tissue in case of an imminent perforation.

{"title": "Functional muscle regeneration with combined delivery of angiogenesis and myogenesis factors.", "abstract": "Regenerative efforts typically focus on the delivery of single factors, but it is likely that multiple factors regulating distinct aspects of the regenerative process (e.g., vascularization and stem cell activation) can be used in parallel to affect regeneration of functional tissues. This possibility was addressed in the context of ischemic muscle injury, which typically leads to necrosis and loss of tissue and function. The role of sustained delivery, via injectable gel, of a combination of VEGF to promote angiogenesis and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) to directly promote muscle regeneration and the return of muscle function in ischemic rodent hindlimbs was investigated. Sustained VEGF delivery alone led to neoangiogenesis in ischemic limbs, with complete return of tissue perfusion to normal levels by 3 weeks, as well as protection from hypoxia and tissue necrosis, leading to an improvement in muscle contractility. Sustained IGF1 delivery alone was found to enhance muscle fiber regeneration and protected cells from apoptosis. However, the combined delivery of VEGF and IGF1 led to parallel angiogenesis, reinnervation, and myogenesis; as satellite cell activation and proliferation was stimulated, cells were protected from apoptosis, the inflammatory response was muted, and highly functional muscle tissue was formed. In contrast, bolus delivery of factors did not have any benefit in terms of neoangiogenesis and perfusion and had minimal effect on muscle regeneration. These results support the utility of simultaneously targeting distinct aspects of the regenerative process.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["CristinaBorselli", "HannahStorrie", "FrankBenesch-Lee", "DmitryShvartsman", "ChristineCezar", "Jeff WLichtman", "Herman HVandenburgh", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0903875106"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of myocardium-coronary vessel interaction.", "abstract": "The mechanisms by which the contracting myocardium exerts extravascular forces (intramyocardial pressure, IMP) on coronary blood vessels and by which it affects the coronary flow remain incompletely understood. Several myocardium-vessel interaction (MVI) mechanisms have been proposed, but none can account for all the major flow features. In the present study, we hypothesized that only a specific combination of MVI mechanisms can account for all observed coronary flow features. Three basic interaction mechanisms (time-varying elasticity, myocardial shortening-induced intracellular pressure, and ventricular cavity-induced extracellular pressure) and their combinations were analyzed based on physical principles (conservation of mass and force equilibrium) in a realistic data-based vascular network. Mechanical properties of both vessel wall and myocardium were coupled through stress analysis to simulate the response of vessels to internal blood pressure and external (myocardial) mechanical loading. Predictions of transmural dynamic vascular pressure, diameter, and flow velocity were determined under each MVI mechanism and compared with reported data. The results show that none of the three basic mechanisms alone can account for the measured data. Only the combined effect of the cavity-induced extracellular pressure and the shortening-induced intramyocyte pressure provides good agreement with the majority of measurements.

Endothelial cell activation, in turn, is mediated primarily at the level of gene transcription. Here, we show that in response to several activation agonists, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and thrombin, endothelial cells demonstrate rapid and profound induction of the early growth response (Egr) genes egr-1 and egr-3. In VEGF-treated endothelial cells, induction of Egr-3 was far greater and more prolonged compared with Egr-1. VEGF-mediated stimulation of Egr-3 involved the inducible binding of NFATc, serum response factor, and CREB to their respective consensus motifs in the upstream promoter region of Egr-3. Knockdown of Egr-3 markedly impaired VEGF-mediated proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells and blocked VEGF-induced monocyte adhesion. Egr-3 knockdown abrogated VEGF-mediated vascular outgrowth from ex vivo aortic rings and attenuated Matrigel plug vascularization and melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that Egr-3 is a critical determinant of VEGF signaling in activated endothelial cells. Thus, Egr-3 represents a potential therapeutic target in VEGF-mediated vasculopathic diseases.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["Jun-ichiSuehiro", "TakaoHamakubo", "TatsuhikoKodama", "William CAird", "TakashiMinami"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-07-233478"}

Correcting penile curvature is an essential step in proximal hypospadias surgery. It is logical to lengthen the ventral radius using a graft; however, penile curvature would recur owing to a graft contracture with inadequate vascularization. Although a tunica vaginalis is considered a suitable material to be used as a flap instead of a graft, clinical application of this technique is uncommon. Information regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of this procedure is required.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, we repaired 146 patients with hypospadias and the urethral plate was transected in 39 patients because of severe curvature. Significant severe curvature persisting even after transection of the plate was corrected with ventral corporeal lengthening procedures using a tunica vaginalis flap in 15 patients and postoperative results were evaluated.\nStraight penile erection was identified in all 15 boys at home by their parents. In 7 of the 15 boys, artificial erection was performed at the time of additional surgery; 5 degrees of curvature was found in 2 patients and 0 degree in 5.\nAt the second session of surgery, we observed that penile straightening was maintained without recurrence of curvature. Additionally, the area in which the tunica vaginalis flap was placed on the ventrum did not contract. Therefore, lengthening the ventral aspect using a tunica vaginalis flap might be an important alternative for correction of severe penile curvature in hypospadias surgery.", "journal": "Urology", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["YutaroHayashi", "YoshiyukiKojima", "KentaroMizuno", "AkihiroNakane", "ToshikiKato", "SatoshiKurokawa", "HideyukiKamisawa", "TetsujiMaruyama", "KenjiroKohri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.urology.2009.08.080"}

We investigated the effects of long-term voluntary wheel running on growth and progression using an animal model of human breast cancer. We also examined effects on the central features of tumor physiology, including markers of tumor blood perfusion/vascularization, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Athymic female mice fed a high-fat diet were orthotopically (direct into the mammary fat pad) implanted with human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 at 1 x 10(6)) into the right dorsal mammary fat pad and randomly assigned (1:1) to voluntary wheel running (n = 25) or a nonintervention (sedentary) control group (n = 25). Tumor volume was measured every three days using digital calipers. All experimental animals were killed when tumor volume reached > or = 1,500 mm(3).

However, tumors from exercising animals had significantly improved blood perfusion/vascularization relative to the sedentary control group (P < 0.05). Histological analyses indicated that intratumoral hypoxia levels (as assessed by hypoxia-inducible factor 1) were significantly higher in the exercise group relative to sedentary control (P < 0.05).

The areas of blood-brain barrier leakage were associated with increased staining of HRP and C-terminal of amyloid precursor protein/beta-amyloid peptide in perivascular space suggesting, respectively, an additional response to ischemia and neuronal death.

{"title": "Complications of limb salvage surgery in childhood tumors and recommended solutions.", "abstract": "Bone and soft tissue malignancies are associated with serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems in every level of pubertal growth in children. Current treatment modality preferred in bone and soft tissue tumors is wide resection of tumor followed by the reconstruction of consequent defect by various methods.

Mostly, it is very difficult to control problems following wide resection and reconstruction. In this study, our aim is to discuss the problems encountered in different resection and reconstruction approaches in childhood bone and soft tissue tumors, and the recommended solutions addressed to these problems.

With sacrificed physis, 13 patients had a mean value of 4.6 cm limb shortness. Limb salvage surgery has been considered as the gold standard treatment in orthopedic oncological surgery. More understanding of the biology of sarcoma, introduction of new effective chemotherapeutic agents, development of new techniques concerning the surgical resection, advances in diagnostic methods, and improvements in reconstructive surgery all make a major contribution to limb salvage surgery.

We have previously shown that metabolic stress due to glucose depletion (GD) induces necrosis and HMGB1 release through mitochondrial ROS production in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on GD-induced necrosis and show that hypoxia prevented GD-induced mitochondrial ROS production, HMGB1 release, and necrosis and switched the cell death mode to apoptosis that is dependent on caspase-3 and -9. We further found that inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 abolished the effects of hypoxia to switch the cell death mode and to suppress mitochondrial ROS production, indicating an important role(s) of the ERK pathway in cell death mode determination. We also found that during OGD-induced apoptosis the prosurvival protein kinase Akt is activated and inhibition of Akt by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin prevent OGD-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG. Similar inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors were observed in A549 cells that underwent apoptosis when treated with GD in the presence of NAC (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a H(2)O(2) scavenger), or in the presence of active PKC by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, indicating a crucial role(s) of the PI3K-Akt pathway in OGD-indcued apoptosis.

{"title": "Bioinspired engineering study of Plantae vascules for self-healing composite structures.", "abstract": "This paper presents the first conceptual study into creating a Plantae-inspired vascular network within a fibre-reinforced polymer composite laminate, which provides an ongoing self-healing functionality without incurring a mass penalty. Through the application of a 'lost-wax' technique, orthogonal hollow vascules, inspired by the 'ray cell' structures found in ring porous hardwoods, were successfully introduced within a carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy polymer composite laminate. The influence on fibre architecture and mechanical behaviour of single vascules (located on the laminate centreline) when aligned parallel and transverse to the local host ply was characterized experimentally using a compression-after-impact test methodology. Ultrasonic C-scanning and high-resolution micro-CT X-ray was undertaken to identify the influence of and interaction between the internal vasculature and impact damage. The results clearly show that damage morphology is influenced by vascule orientation and that a 10 J low-velocity impact damage event is sufficient to breach the vasculature; a prerequisite for any subsequent self-healing function. The residual compressive strength after a 10 J impact was found to be dependent upon vascule orientation. In general, residual compressive strength decreased to 70 per cent of undamaged strength when vasculature was aligned parallel to the local host ply and a value of 63 per cent when aligned transverse.

{"title": "Effect of cell seeding and mechanical loading on vascularization and tissue formation inside a scaffold: a mechano-biological model using a lattice approach to simulate cell activity.", "abstract": "Achieving successful vascularization remains one of the main problems in bone tissue engineering. After scaffold implantation, the growth of capillaries into the porous construct may be too slow to provide adequate nutrients to the cells in the scaffold interior and this inhibits tissue formation in the scaffold core. Often, prior to implantation, a controlled cell culture environment is used to stimulate cell proliferation and, once in place, the mechanical environment acting on the tissue construct is determined by the loading conditions at the implantation site. To what extent do cell seeding conditions and the construct loading environment have an effect on scaffold vascularization and tissue growth? In this study, a mechano-biological model for tissue differentiation and blood vessel growth was used to determine the influence of cell seeding on vascular network development and tissue growth inside a regular-structured bone scaffold under different loading conditions. It is predicted that increasing the number of cells seeded homogeneously reduces the rate of vascularization and the maximum penetration of the vascular network, which in turn reduces bone tissue formation. The seeding of cells in the periphery of the scaffold was predicted to be beneficial for vascularization and therefore for bone growth; however, tissue formation occurred more slowly during the first weeks after implantation compared to homogeneous seeding. Low levels of mechanical loading stimulated bone formation while high levels of loading inhibited bone formation and capillary growth. This study demonstrates the feasibility of computational design approaches for bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2009-12-04", "authors": ["SaraCheca", "Patrick JPrendergast"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.044"}

Of the 1,280 eyes in 1,255 patients receiving 2,890 intravitreal injections, there were 125 eyes with vPED. For every vPED eye that developed an RPE tear (Group 1), 3 or more vPED eyes without RPE tears (Group 2) were randomly selected in each study center during the same time period for comparison. The primary outcome measure was PED height (microm), and the secondary measures included volume index (vPED height x surface area), total macular volume, subretinal fluid, cystoid macular edema, center-point thickness, central 1 mm, and pre- and postinjection best-corrected Snellen visual acuities.\nTwenty-one vPED eyes in 21 patients among 125 vPED eyes (16.8% of all vPED eyes) developed RPE tears. The 21 Group 1 eyes were compared with the 78 randomly selected Group 2 eyes. The vPED height was significantly higher for Group 1 eyes in comparison to Group 2 eyes (mean: 648.9 +/- 245.0 vs. 338.1 +/- 201.6 microm, P < 0.001). The same was true for the following: volume index (P = 0.001), subretinal fluid (P = 0.002), and total macular volume (P = 0.04). The mean preinjection and post-RPE tear best-corrected visual acuity were 0.92 logMAR (20/166) and 0.84 logMAR (20/137), respectively (P = 0.25). Multivariate analysis showed PED height to be the only significant risk factor associated with RPE tears in Group 1 eyes [odds ratio = 0.995 (95% confidence interval: 0.992-0.997), P < 0.001].\nElevated preinjection vPED height is the single most significant predictor for RPE tears after bevacizumab injections for vPED eyes.

We have previously demonstrated (pro-)cathepsin-L as a target of INSL3 in human thyroid cancer cells facilitating penetration of tumor cells through elastin matrices. We demonstrate the expression of RXFP2 in human thyroid tissues and in mouse follicular thyroid epithelial cells using Cre-recombinase transgene driven by Rxfp2 promoter. Recombinant and secreted INSL3 increased the motility of thyroid carcinoma (TC) cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner. This effect required the presence of RXFP2. We identified S100A4 as a novel INSL3 target molecule and showed that S100A4 facilitated INSL3-induced enhanced motility. Stable transfectants of the human follicular TC cell line FTC-133 expressing and secreting bioactive human INSL3 displayed enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assays. Xenotransplant experiments in nude mice showed that INSL3, but not EGFP-mock transfectants, developed fast-growing and highly vascularized xenografts. We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells in capillary tube formation assays to demonstrate increased 2-dimensional tube formations induced by recombinant human INSL3 and human S100A4 comparable to the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor used as positive control. We conclude that INSL3 is a powerful and multifunctional promoter of tumor growth and angiogenesis in human thyroid cancer cell xenografts.

We report here the fabrication of angiogenic cell sheets using a combination of two magnetic force-based techniques which use magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs), magnetofection and magnetic cell accumulation. A retroviral vector encoding an expression cassette of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was labeled with MCLs, to magnetically attract the particles onto a monolayer of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, for gene delivery. MCL-mediated infection increased transduction efficiency by 6.7-fold compared with the conventional method. During the fabrication of the tissue constructs, MCL-labeled cells were accumulated in the presence of a magnetic field to promote the spontaneous formation of a multilayered cell sheet. VEGF gene-engineered C2C12 (C2C12/VEGF) cell sheets, constructed using both magnetic force-based techniques, were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice.

{"title": "Adipose tissue derived stem cells secretome: soluble factors and their roles in regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Stem cells have been long looked at as possible therapeutic vehicles for different health related problems. Among the different existing stem cell populations, Adipose- derived Stem Cells (ASCs) have been gathering attention in the last 10 years. When compared to other stem cells populations and sources, ASCs can be easily isolated while providing simultaneously higher yields upon the processing of adipose tissue. Similar to other stem cell populations, it was initially thought that the main potential of ASCs for regenerative medicine approaches was intimately related to their differentiation capability. Although this is true, there has been an increasing body of literature describing the trophic effects of ASCs on the protection, survival and differentiation of variety of endogenous cells/tissues. Moreover, they have also shown to possess an immunomodulatory character. This effect is closely related to the ASCs' secretome and the soluble factors found within it. Molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factors, interleukins (ILs) 6, 7, 8 and 11, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), adipokines and others have been identified within the ASCs' secretome. Due to its importance regarding future applications for the field of regenerative medicine, we aim, in the present review, to make a comprehensive analysis of the literature relating to the ASCs' secretome and its relevance to the immune and central nervous system, vascularization and cardiac regeneration.

{"title": "Inhibition of semaphorin as a novel strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The axon-guiding molecules known as semaphorins and their receptors (plexins) regulate the vascular pattern and play an important role in the development of vascular network during embryogenesis. Semaphorin (Sema)3E is one of the class 3 semaphorins, and plexinD1 is known to be its receptor. Although these molecules have a role in embryonic vascular development, it remains unclear whether the Sema3E/plexinD1 axis is involved in postnatal angiogenesis.\nThe objective of this study was to elucidate the role of Sema3E/plexinD1 in postnatal angiogenesis.\nSema3E inhibited cell growth and tube formation by suppressing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Expression of Sema3E and plexinD1 was markedly upregulated in ischemic limbs of mice (2.5- and 4.5-fold increase for Sema3E and plexinD1, respectively), and inhibition of this pathway by introduction of the plexinD1-Fc gene or disruption of Sema3E led to a significant increase of blood flow recovery (1.6- and 1.5-fold increase for the plexinD1-Fc gene treatment and Sema3E disruption, respectively). Hypoxia activated the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby upregulating Sema3E expression. Expression of p53 and Sema3E was enhanced in diabetic mice compared with normal mice (2- and 1.3-fold increase for p53 and Sema3E, respectively). Consequently, neovascularization after VEGF treatment was poor in the ischemic tissues of diabetic mice, whereas treatment with VEGF plus plexinD1-Fc markedly improved neovascularization.\nThese results indicate that inhibition of Sema3E may be a novel strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis, especially when VEGF is ineffective.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JunjiMoriya", "TohruMinamino", "KaoruTateno", "ShoOkada", "AkiyoshiUemura", "IppeiShimizu", "MasatakaYokoyama", "AikaNojima", "MitsuhiroOkada", "HisashiKoga", "IsseiKomuro"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.210815"}
{"title": "Differential effects of hypoxia on osteochondrogenic potential of human adipose-derived stem cells.", "abstract": "Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hATSC) have been contemplated as reparative cells for cartilage engineering. Chondrogenic differentiation of hATSC can be induced by an enriched culture medium and a three-dimensional environment. Given that bone is vascularized and cartilage is not, oxygen tension has been suggested as a regulatory factor for osteochondrogenic differentiation. Our work aimed at determining whether hypoxia affects the osteochondrogenic potential of hATSC. hATSC were cultured in chondrogenic or osteogenic medium for 28 days, in pellets or monolayers, and under 5% or 20% oxygen tension. Cell differentiation was monitored by real-time PCR (COL2A1, aggrecan, Runx2, and osteocalcin). The chondrogenic differentiation was further evaluated by Alcian blue and immunohistological staining for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen, respectively. Osteogenic differentiation was also assessed by the staining of mineralized matrix (Alizarin Red) and measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The expression of chondrogenic markers was upregulated when hATSC were exposed to hypoxia in chondrogenic medium. Conversely, osteocalcin expression, mineralization, and ALP activity were severely reduced under hypoxic conditions even in the presence of osteogenic medium. Our data strongly suggest that hypoxia favors the chondrogenic differentiation of hATSC as evidenced by the expression of the chondrogenic markers, whereas it could alter their osteogenic potential. Our results highlight the differential regulatory role of hypoxia on the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes of hATSC.

Paradoxically, shallow trophoblast invasion and defective vascular remodelling of the uterine spiral arteries in the first trimester may result in impaired placental perfusion and chronic placental ischemia and hypoxia later in gestation leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are key mediators of the response to low oxygen. We aimed to elucidate mechanisms of regulation of HIFs and the role these may play in the control of placental differentiation, growth and function in both normal and pathological pregnancies. The Pubmed database was consulted for identification of the most relevant published articles. Search terms used were oxygen, placenta, trophoblast, pregnancy, HIF and hypoxia. The HIFs are able to function throughout all aspects of normal and abnormal placental differentiation, growth and function; during the first trimester (physiologically low oxygen), during mid-late gestation (where there is adequate supply of blood and oxygen to the placenta) and in pathological pregnancies complicated by placental hypoxia/ischemia. During normal pregnancy HIFs may respond to complex alterations in oxygen, hormones, cytokines and growth factors to regulate placental invasion, differentiation, transport and vascularization. In the ever-changing environment created during pregnancy, the HIFs appear to act as key mediators of placental development and function and thereby are likely to be important contributors to both normal and adverse pregnancy outcomes.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2009-11-21", "authors": ["K GPringle", "K LKind", "A NSferruzzi-Perri", "J GThompson", "C TRoberts"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/dmp046"}

Ischemic fractures were generated in male adult mice by resecting the femoral artery prior to the creation of a nonstabilized tibia fracture. Recombinant human BMP7 (rhBMP7, 50 microg) was injected into the fracture site immediately after surgery. At 7 days after injury, more tissue vascularization was observed in rhBMP7 treated fractures. Histomorphometric analyses revealed that rhBMP7 induced more cartilage at day 7, more callus and bone at days 14 and 28, and more adipose tissue and fibrous tissue at days 7, 14, and 28 compared to controls (n=5/group/time). At day 28, all fractures treated with rhBMP7 (50 microg, n=5) healed, whereas only three of five control fractures exhibited slight bony bridging. In addition, we found that rhBMP7 (both 10 and 50 microg) significantly increased the amount of cartilage compared to controls in stabilized fractures, confirming its chondrogenic effect. Lastly, using bone marrow transplantation, we determined that no donor-derived osteocytes or chondrocytes were present in rhBMP7-treated fractures, suggesting rhBMP7 did not recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow to the fracture site.

We previously reported that the angiogenic growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) coaxes monocytes to assume the phenotype of functional endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study we show that PTN expression is colocalized with capillaries of human atherosclerotic plaques. Among the various reagents that are critical to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, interferon (IFN)-gamma was found to markedly induce PTN mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in macrophages. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Janus kinase inhibitors, WHI-P154 and ATA, efficiently blocked STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Notably, the level of phosphorylated STAT1 was found to correlate directly with the PTN mRNA levels. In addition, STAT1/STAT3/p44/42 signaling molecules were found to be phosphorylated by IFN-gamma in macrophages, and they were translocated into the nucleus. Further, PTN promoter analysis showed that a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) located at -2086 to -2078 bp is essential for IFN-gamma-regulated promoter activity. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that both STAT1 and STAT3 bind to the GAS at the chromatin level in the IFN-gamma stimulated cells. Finally, to test whether the combined effect of STAT1/STAT3/p44/42 signaling is required for the expression of PTN in macrophages, gene knockdowns of these transcription factors were performed using siRNA.

From a prospective database, results after pneumonectomy were compared between patients receiving and not receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation during the same time period.\nOver 7 years, 50 pneumonectomies were performed for non-small-cell carcinoma; 18 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation (group A) and 32 did not (group B). Comparing group A with group B, there was no significant difference in patient demographics, blood loss, transfusion requirements or pneumonectomy side. Group A had more patients with stage III disease [17/ 18 (94%) versus 15/32 (47%), P = 0.001] and also more often had vascularized flap for bronchial stump coverage [17/18 (94%) versus 4/32 (13%), P < 0.001].

Pigs' vasculature in the skin is anatomically and physiologically similar to human, making it an ideal model for research. Until now, most vascular imaging studies are of two-dimensions. The aim of this study is to provide a three-dimensional (3D) model that reveals detailed architecture of the vascular network of the porcine, for accurate quantitative assessment.\nFive Guangxi Bama minipigs were anaesthetized intramuscularly and underwent whole body lead oxide-gelatin injection. Spiral computed tomography scanning was performed on the subjects and three-dimensional reconstructions were made. Another minipig was used, and underwent Cardiografin injection. 3D-reconstruction was executed in vivo. All subjects were then dissected by layers to document the individual perforators.\nAngiography using perfusion with lead oxide-gelatine mixture has the advantage of illustrating distinctively the vessels and their perforating branches. However, it is incapable of displaying other tissues structures. Angiography through perfusion with Cardiografin in vivo has the advantage of demonstrating the relationship between arteries and bones. Yet it could only display coarsely the vascular trunk, and is incapable of displaying the vascular network. By combining these two methods, the 3D structure, source, course, and territories of the arteries were presented distinctively.\n3D modeling in combination with traditional sectional imaging of the pig model enables blood vessels to be displayed more dynamically with greater realism.

We tested the hypothesis that ascorbic acid (AA) reduces cell death in myocardial grafts both in vitro and in vivo and introduced a new model of autologous graft vascularization for later transplantation. Luciferase (Fluc)- and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing H9C2 cardiomyoblasts were seeded in gelatin scaffolds to form myocardial artificial grafts (MAGs). MAGs were supplemented with AA (5 or 50 mumol/L) or plain growth medium. Bioluminescence imaging showed increased cell photon emission from day 1 to 5 in grafts supplemented with 5 mumol/L (p < 0.001) and 50 mumol/L (p < 0.01) AA. The amount of apoptotic cells in plain MAGs was significantly higher than in AA-enriched grafts. In our in vitro model, AA also enhanced H9C2 cell myogenic differentiation. For in vivo studies, MAGs containing H9C2-GFP-Fluc cells and enriched with AA (n = 10) or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 10) were implanted in the renal pouch of Wistar rats. At day 6, postimplantation bioluminescence signals decreased by 74% of baseline in plain MAGs versus 36% in AA-enriched MAGs (p < 0.0001).

However, to facilitate systemic application it would be useful to improve tumor targeting and antitumor efficacy further. Here we report the generation of vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig, a targeted and armed oncolytic vaccinia virus. Tumor targeting was achieved by deletion of genes for thymidine kinase and vaccinia virus growth factor, which are necessary for replication in normal but not in cancer cells. Given the high vascularization typical of kidney cancers, we armed the virus with the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 protein for an antiangiogenic effect. Systemic application of high doses of vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig resulted in cytokine induction in an immunocompromised mouse model. Upon histopathological analysis, splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis was seen in all virus-injected mice and was more pronounced in the vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig group. Analysis of the innate immune response after intravenous virus injection revealed high transient and dose-dependent cytokine elevations. When medium and low doses were used for intratumoral or intravenous injection, vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig exhibited a stronger antitumor effect than the unarmed control. Furthermore, expression of VEGFR-1-Ig was confirmed, and a concurrent antiangiogenic effect was seen. In an immunocompetent model, systemic vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig exhibited superior antitumor efficacy compared to the unarmed control virus. In conclusion, the targeted and armed vvdd-VEGFR-1-Ig has promising anticancer activity in renal cell cancer models.

The influence of the temporal profile of VEGF concentration, dose, and the impact of VEGF spatial distribution on angiogenesis in in vitro models of angiogenesis and ischemic murine limbs was analyzed in this study. Importantly, a profile consisting of a high VEGF concentration initially, followed by a decreasing concentration over time was found to yield optimal angiogenic sprouting. A total VEGF dose 0.1 microg/g, when delivered with kinetics found to be optimal in vitro, provided a favorable therapeutic dose in murine hindlimb ischemia model, and distributing this VEGF dose in two spatial locations induces a higher level of vascularization and perfusion than a single location.

In this work, we investigate the consequences of a combined raloxifene/estrogen therapy on bone and uterus with experimental osteoporosis. 40 Wistar rats began treatment 3 months post-ovariectomy. Estrogen and raloxifene were administered 0.03 mg/kg/day and 1.5mg/kg/day separately and together for 5 times per week for 12 weeks. Biomechanical tests and bone mineral density measurements, histology of uterus, and blood markers were analyzed. The co-administration group had higher toughness and ultimate strength than the ovariectomized controls (P<0.01). E+R had better biomechanical properties than the single treatments; yet the differences were not significant. Uterus histology signified high degeneration in the estrogen group. The raloxifene group had less degeneration but higher vascularization. Less immune reaction and vascularization were observed in the group with combined dosage than in those with individual treatments. Hence, the uterus of the combined treatment had fewer side effects than the ones that were individually treated. Mutual antagonization might be possible between raloxifene and estrogen, and that might have caused a decrease in the adverse effects.

The endometrial volume was calculated, along with the vascularization index (VI), flow index and vascularization flow index (VFI) in the endometrium and in a 2-mm 'shell' surrounding the endometrium. The 'gold standard' was the histological diagnosis of the endometrium obtained by hysteroscopic resection of focal lesions, dilatation and curettage or hysterectomy. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves were drawn for all measurements to evaluate their ability to distinguish between benign and malignant endometrium. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to create mathematical models to estimate the risk of endometrial malignancy.\nThere were 49 benign and 13 malignant endometria. Endometrial thickness and volume were significantly larger in malignant than in benign endometria, and flow indices in the endometrium and endometrial shell were significantly higher. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of endometrial thickness was 0.82, that of endometrial volume 0.78, and that of the two best power Doppler variables (VI and VFI in the endometrium) 0.82 and 0.82.

Current treatments are ineffective, and new PDA therapies are urgently needed. In this context, ultrasound-mediated chemotherapy by polymeric micelles and/or nanoemulsion/microbubble encapsulated drugs may offer an innovative approach to PDA treatment. PDA xenografts were orthotopically grown in the pancreas tails of nu/nu mice by surgical insertion of red fluorescence protein (RFP)-transfected MiaPaCa-2 cells. Tumor growth was controlled by fluorescence imaging. Occasional sonographic measurements correlated well with the formal tumor tracking by red fluorescence. Tumor accumulation of paclitaxel-loaded nanoemulsion droplets and droplet-to-bubble transition under therapeutic ultrasound was monitored by diagnostic ultrasound imaging. MiaPaCa-2 tumors manifested resistance to treatment by gemcitabine (GEM). This drug is the gold standard for PDA therapy. The GEM-resistant tumors proved sensitive to paclitaxel. Among six experimental groups studied, the strongest therapeutic effect was exerted by the following drug formulation: GEM + nanodroplet-encapsulated paclitaxel (nbGEN) combined with tumor-directed 1-MHz ultrasound that was applied for 30 s four to five hours after the systemic drug injection. Ultrasound-mediated PDA therapy by either micellar or nanoemulsion encapsulated paclitaxel resulted in substantial suppression of metastases and ascites, suggesting ultrasound-enhanced killing of invasive cancerous cells. However, tumors relapsed after the completion of therapy, indicating survival of some tumor cells. The recurrent tumors manifested development of paclitaxel resistance. Ultrasound imaging suggested nonuniform distribution of nanodroplets in the tumor volume due to irregular vascularization, which may result in the development of zones with subtherapeutic drug concentration.

Mice overexpressing HIFalpha subunits in osteoblasts produce abundant VEGF and develop extremely dense, highly vascularized long bones. In this study, we investigated the individual contributions of Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha in angiogenesis and osteogenesis by individually disrupting each Hifalpha gene in osteoblasts using the Cre-loxP method. Mice lacking Hif-1alpha demonstrated markedly decreased trabecular bone volume, reduced bone formation rate, and altered cortical bone architecture. By contrast, mice lacking Hif-2alpha had only a modest decrease in trabecular bone volume. Interestingly, long bone blood vessel development measured by angiography was decreased by a similar degree in both DeltaHif-1alpha and DeltaHif-2alpha mice suggesting a common role for these Hifalpha subunits in skeletal angiogenesis. In agreement with this idea, osteoblasts lacking either Hif-1alpha or Hif-2alpha had profound reductions in VEGF mRNA expression but only the loss of Hif-1alpha impaired osteoblast proliferation. These findings indicate that expression of both Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha by osteoblasts is required for long bone development.

The mean age of the patients was 44 years (range, 19-59 years). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 8 years; range, 2-11 years).\nTwenty patients (23 hips) had conversion surgery to THA. The mean Harris hip scores for the patients who did not have conversion surgery to THA improved from 53 to 88 points. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in the 11-year survival rate between patients with Stage II and Stage III disease (THA as an end point). However, the survival rate was lower for patients with Stage IV disease compared with patients with Stages II and III disease.

{"title": "Chapter 55: neural transplantation.", "abstract": "The history of cell transplantation in the nervous system is reviewed in four main sections. The \"early era\" spans the period from 1890 to 1940, during which the first attempts at cell transplantation in the brain were undertaken. Many contemporary themes were first addressed such as surgical factors to achieve survival of grafted cells and how that should be assessed, immunological factors, use of tumors as a readily viable cell source; and use of the anterior eye chamber as a model transplantation site. However, such studies generally exhibited only low levels of viability or successful implantation. The \"middle era\" from 1940 to 1970 spans the period when the techniques for viable and reliable cell transplantation using embryonic donor tissues implanted into sites with effective vascularization were first established in brain and neuroendocrine systems in a limited number of specialist centers. However, although sometimes impressive, these results were at variance with the prevailing view that the adult mammalian brain is immutable and resistant to plasticity, growth or regeneration, and were largely ignored. The \"modern era,\" since 1970, began with the pioneering studies that combined cell transplantation with the use of improved histochemical and ultrastructural anatomical techniques to demonstrate selectivity, specificity and regenerative capacity of implanted cells, and the slow acceptance that the adult brain does exhibit considerable potential for plasticity and repair. The last three decades have witnessed the identification of reliable and efficient transplantation technologies combined with progressively refined methods of molecular, cellular, biochemical, physiological and functional analysis. This now enables the ready use of cell transplantation as a powerful novel method within the neuroscience tool-kit, which is being used: to analyze normal organization and function of the nervous system; to reveal the biological mechanisms and principles of neuronal development, regeneration and plasticity; and to study the principles of surgically directed cell therapies for promoting plasticity, replacement and repair in response to injury and disease.

{"title": "Thick soft tissue reconstruction on highly perfusive biodegradable scaffolds.", "abstract": "The lack of a vascular network and poor perfusion is what mostly prevents three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds from being used in organ repair when reconstruction of thick tissues is needed. Highly-porous scaffolds made of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) are prepared by directional thermally induced phase separation (dTIPS) starting from 1,4-dioxane/PLLA solutions. The influence of polymer concentration and temperature gradient, in terms of imposed intensity and direction, on pore size and distribution is studied by comparison with scaffolds prepared by isotropic TIPS. The processing parameters are optimized to achieve an overall porosity for the 3D scaffolds of about 93% with a degree of interconnectivity of 91%. The resulting pore network is characterized by the ordered repetition of closely packed dendrite-like cavities, each one showing stacks of 20 microm large side lamellar branches departing from 70 microm diameter vertical backbones, strongly resembling the vascular patterns. The in vitro biological responses after 1 and 2 weeks are evaluated from mesenchymal (bone marrow stromal) cells (MSC) static culturing. A novel vacuum-based deep-seeding method is set up to improve uniform cell penetration down to scaffold thicknesses of over 1 mm. Biological screenings show significant 3D scaffold colonization even after 18 h, while cellular retention is observed up to 14 d in vitro (DIV).

{"title": "An alternative technique to shape scaffolds with hierarchical porosity at physiological temperature.", "abstract": "The method described in this work, termed GELPOR3D, is characterised by its simplicity of use, low-cost equipment, compositional flexibility, and lack of aggressive or toxic solvents or other thermal treatment. This technique ensures the generation of a three-dimensional network of interconnected pores (300-900 microm); in addition, a random and not necessarily connected porosity is generated, yielding a hierarchical porous architecture from the macro to the molecular scale. The interconnected pores, large enough to ensure an adequate vascularization and new tissue ingrowth, can be obtained by pouring a slurry containing a biodegradable thermogel (such as agarose and gellan) and a ceramic into a mold consisting of a three-dimensional network of rigid filaments. Additional pore distributions in the macropore region can be tailored as a function of the drying/preservation technology (10-100 microm) or the interaction between the inorganic particles coated by the polymeric components (0.1-1 microm). Moreover, porosity in the mesopore range can be created by shaping ceramics such as mesoporous silica or nanocrystalline carbonatehydroxyapatite. In addition to the various bioceramics that have been successfully shaped, this method is flexible enough to allow the introduction of certain substances whose controlled release may help to avoid some negative effects that usually appear with the implantation of a material, i.e. infection, inflammation, etc., or to simplify some of the many steps required for the successful integration of a graft.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2009-11-06", "authors": ["JuanPe\u00f1a", "Jes\u00fasRom\u00e1n", "MVictoria Caba\u00f1as", "Mar\u00edaVallet-Reg\u00ed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2009.10.049"}
{"title": "Sonic hedgehog promotes angiogenesis and osteogenesis in a coculture system consisting of primary osteoblasts and outgrowth endothelial cells.", "abstract": "A number of previous studies documented the angiogenic potential of outgrowth endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo and provided evidence that therapeutic success could depend on coculture or coimplantation strategies. Thus, deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this pro-angiogenic effect of cocultures might provide new translational options for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. One promising signaling pathway in bone repair involved in neoangiogenesis and bone formation is the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In this article, we focus on the effect of Shh on the formation of microvessel-like structures and osteoblastic differentiation in cocultures of primary osteoblasts and outgrowth endothelial cells. Already after 24 h of treatment, Shh leads to a massive increase in microvessel-like structures compared with untreated cocultures. Increased formation of angiogenic structures seems to correlate with the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor or angiopoietins (Ang-1 and Ang-2) studied at both the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, treatment with cyclopamine, an inhibitor of hedgehog signaling, blocked the formation of microvessel-like structures in the cocultures. However, exogenous Shh also resulted in the upregulation of several osteogenic differentiation markers in real-time polymerase chain reaction, as well as in an increased mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity. The present data highlight the central role of the Shh pathway in bone regeneration and vascularization. Further, Shh might have the potential to improve both angiogenesis and osteogenesis in clinical applications in the future.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In the ovary, angiogenesis is known to occur after ovulation in the developing corpus luteum (CL) in mammals. To determine whether HIF1 participates in angiogenesis in bovine CL, the present study investigated the mRNA and protein expressions of the HIF1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and VEGF in bovine CL during the estrous cycle. The effects of hypoxia on the expressions of HIF1A protein, VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein in bovine luteal cells were also examined by using a cell culture system. HIF1A mRNA expression was less at the regressed stage than at the other stages, whereas protein expression of HIF1A was highest at the early luteal stage and decreased thereafter. VEGF mRNA expression was highest at the developing luteal stage and decreased thereafter. VEGF protein expression was highest at the early luteal stage and decreased significantly at the regressed luteal stage. Hypoxia increased the amounts of HIF1A protein, VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein in cultured bovine luteal cells. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia inhibited progesterone production in the mid luteal cells, but not in the early luteal cells. The overall findings indicate that HIF1 is one of the factors promoting VEGF-induced angiogenesis during luteal development, and suggest that the hypoxic conditions formed after follicle rupture contribute to establishing luteal vascularization in cattle.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["RyoNishimura", "KiyoshiOkuda"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.09-162e"}

Examination by X-ray and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), histologic analysis, and biomechanical tests were used to evaluate repair and the vascularization of the implants. The results showed that by co-seeding MSCs and MSC-derived ECs, the resulting vascularization was able to promote osteogenesis and improve mechanical properties. The rabbits treated with vascularized tissue engineered bone exhibited far more extensive osteogenesis and good vascularization.

CS was a better implantable hemostatic material than gelatin sponge (GS) or oxidized cellulose (OC) in both the acute and chronic bleeding models. The better efficacy of CS may be due to its greater ability to enhance platelet activation, erythrocyte aggregation and morphological alteration, and thrombin generation at sites it is applied than GS or OC. Moreover, preliminary safety evaluations have demonstrated excellent blood and cell compatibility in hemorheological measurements, blood coagulation analysis, histological evaluations and hepatocytes culture experiments. None of CS, GS, or OC induced acute inflammation or other adverse effects while normal tissue growth and vascularization were observed in each case 4 weeks after each hemostatic agent had been implanted.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of EBs showed the best induction, with markedly increased expression of endothelial cell proteins CD31, VE-Cadherin, and von Willebrand Factor, but not the hematopoietic cell marker CD45. CD31 expression peaked around days 10 to 14. Continuous VEGF treatment resulted in a 4- to 5-fold enrichment of CD31(+) cells but did not increase endothelial proliferation rates, suggesting a primary effect on differentiation. CD31(+) cells purified from differentiating EBs upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in response to TNFalpha, confirming their ability to function as endothelial cells.

{"title": "Stimulatory effects of thyroid hormone on brain angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.", "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is critical for the proper development of the central nervous system. However, the specific role of thyroid hormone on brain angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Treatment of rats from birth to postnatal day 21 (P21) with propylthiouracil (PTU), a reversible blocker of triiodothyronine (T3) synthesis, resulted in decreased brain angiogenesis, as indicated by reduced complexity and density of microvessels. However, when PTU was withdrawn at P22, these parameters were fully recovered by P90. These changes were paralleled by an altered expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf2). Physiologic concentrations of T3 and thyroxine (T4) stimulated proliferation and tubulogenesis of rat brain-derived endothelial (RBE4) cells in vitro. Protein and mRNA levels of VEGF-A and FGF-2 increased after T3 stimulation of RBE4 cells. The thyroid hormone receptor blocker NH-3 abolished T3-induced Fgf2 and Vegfa upregulation, indicating a receptor-mediated effect. Thyroid hormone inhibited the apoptosis in RBE4 cells and altered mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes, namely Bcl2 and Bad. The present results show that thyroid hormone has a substantial impact on vasculature development in the brain. Pathologically altered vascularization could, therefore, be a contributing factor to the neurologic deficits induced by thyroid hormone deficiency.", "journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "date": "2009-10-29", "authors": ["LiqunZhang", "Christiana MarieCooper-Kuhn", "UlfNannmark", "KlasBlomgren", "Hans GeorgKuhn"], "doi": "10.1038/jcbfm.2009.216"}
{"title": "Evaluation of oxygen consumption of culture medium and in vitro photodynamic effect of talaporfin sodium in lung tumor cells.", "abstract": "Successful photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires high production of radical ions and singlet oxygen to kill target cells. However, PDT also induces angiogenesis through production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes cell regrowth and vascularization. In this study, we evaluated the importance of oxygen in PDT by measuring oxygen consumption, photosensitizer bleaching, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the culture medium, and VEGF secretion either during or after PDT treatment using mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.\nLocal hypoxia is induced under a low oxygen environment. Oxygen is consumed when ROS and singlet oxygen are produced during PDT. The effect of oxygen consumption on cytotoxicity and VEGF secretion has not been clarified.\nMouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells treated with the photosensitizer talaporfin sodium were irradiated by a continuous wave semiconductor laser (wavelength, 664 +/- 1 nm). We used oxygen microelectrode for oxygen measurement, a fluorescent probe to detect ROS, MTT assay to evaluate the PDT efficacy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure VEGF concentration.\nDuring PDT, oxygen consumption was higher with high doses of talaporfin sodium solution compared with low doses. In addition, the fluorescence of 2-[6-(4'-amino)phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl]benzoic acid, a probe for highly reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (*OH), dramatically increased when the dose of talaporfin sodium solution was high. Moreover, VEGF concentration increased after PDT due to hypoxia in a manner dependent on photosensitizer concentration.\nThese results indicate that the efficiency of PDT might be improved by sustaining a replete oxygen environment during PDT, not only for ROS and singlet oxygen production, but also for inhibiting neoangiogenesis.", "journal": "Photomedicine and laser surgery", "date": "2009-10-29", "authors": ["YutakaTomioka", "ToshihiroKushibiki", "KunioAwazu"], "doi": "10.1089/pho.2008.2468"}

It was hypothesized that the application of hyperbaric oxygen to a tooth moving into the distracted area would accelerate ossification and vascularization of newly formed bone in the distracted space.\nTen dogs were used. After creating a 10-mm-long bone defect, a bony segment was prepared and translocated into the defect area at a rate of 1 mm/d for 10 days. Following the distraction period, tooth movement was started and the dogs were divided into two groups. The HBO group received hyperbaric oxygen; whereas, the control group did not. At 150 days after tooth movement, the distracted area around the moving tooth was evaluated radiologically and histologically. Differences between groups were confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test.\nTrabecular bone density and cortical and subcortical bone areas measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography in the HBO group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Histological observations revealed regenerated bone and blood vessels formation in the tension site of the moving tooth in the HBO group. The regenerated bone structure measured by bone histomorphometry was larger and more active in bone formation in the HBO group than in the control group.\nApplying hyperbaric oxygen to tooth movement into a distracted area appears to accelerate ossification and vascularization of regenerated bone in the that area.", "journal": "The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association", "date": "2009-10-29", "authors": ["TakatoInokuchi", "TatsuoKawamoto", "KazuhiroAoki", "AsatoAoki", "KouheiNagahama", "YoshiyukiBaba", "SyouichiSuzuki", "MasaharuShibayama", "YoshihiroMano", "KeiichiOhya", "KeijiMoriyama"], "doi": "10.1597/09-016.1"}

In this study cigarette smoke exposure was hypothesized to increase expression of the inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, thereby suppressing PGC-1alpha, and hence affecting down stream molecules that regulate oxygen transport and muscle function. Furthermore, we hypothesized that highly vascularized oxidative skeletal muscle would be more susceptible to cigarette smoke than less well-vascularized glycolytic muscle. To test these hypotheses, mice were exposed to cigarette smoke daily for 8 or 16 weeks, resulting in 157% (8 weeks) and 174% (16 weeks) increases in serum TNF-alpha. Separately, TNF-alpha administered to C2C12 myoblasts was found to dose-dependently reduce PGC-1alpha mRNA. In the smoke-exposed mice, PGC-1alpha mRNA was decreased, by 48% in soleus and 23% in EDL. The vascular PGC-1alpha target molecule, VEGF, was also down-regulated, but only in the soleus, which exhibited capillary regression and an oxidative to glycolytic fiber type transition. The apoptosis PGC-1alpha target genes, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were up-regulated, and to a greater extent in the soleus than EDL. Citrate synthase (soleus-19%, EDL-17%) and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (beta-HAD) (soleus-22%, EDL-19%) decreased similarly in both muscle types. There was loss of body and gastrocnemius complex mass, with rapid soleus but not EDL fatigue and diminished exercise endurance.

{"title": "Gallery of uncommon orthopedic implants: a guide for emergency radiologist.", "abstract": "The purpose of this gallery of orthopedic implants was to provide a reference for emergency radiologists to quickly identify uncommon devices in the shoulders, hips, and extremities. The cases presented in this exhibit will include unusual arthroplasties and prostheses as well as bone graft implants (including allograft and autograft). Bone grafts are frequently used for the treatment of bone defects, which may be caused by trauma, infection, or avascularity. Autogenous cancellous, corticocancellous, or cortical bone grafts are often used, either free or vascularized. Alternative bone graft substitutes are also used. An obvious complication of bone grafts is the failure of incorporation. Joint arthroplasty is the most frequently performed orthopedic procedure after fracture fixation. Major indications include degenerative joint disease, inflammatory arthropathy, avascular necrosis, and complicated fractures. Custom orthopedic implants are frequently used for less common indications or for patients with bone tumors. The common hardware complications are infections, loosening, small particle disease/osteolysis, periprosthetic fracture, hardware fracture or dislocation, and recurrent disease, especially in patients with tumors. Many of the devices used by orthopedic surgeons are infrequently seen in everyday radiology practice. With such variations, correct recognition of the prosthetic devices and their complications is very important. The goal of this exhibit was to familiarize the radiologist with both the normal and abnormal appearance of many atypical orthopedic implants. It is important to understand the purpose and proper function of a device, but not necessarily important to describe every device by its proper brand name. Although this exhibit is not meant to be inclusive of every unusual orthopedic implant, we will present multiple examples of orthopedic hardware involving the shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, pelvis, hip, femur, knee, tibia, ankle, and foot that are not likely seen in everyday practice.", "journal": "Emergency radiology", "date": "2009-10-28", "authors": ["EricWhite", "DarrenLu", "BenEyer", "ChrisGottsegen", "ElkeAhlmann", "ChrisAllison"], "doi": "10.1007/s10140-009-0834-6"}

Thus, it is possible to do needle-point monopolar electrocauterization only at the needle tip because of the insulation of the other parts of the needle by the silicone catheter. By retracting the needle with catheter on it during electrocauterization, electrothrombosis was achieved through and around the channel of the needle, leaving vascularized tissue areas between the channels to perfuse the skin or mucosa covering the hemangioma.\nThis technique was applied as a single treatment or before surgery for the treatment of cavernous hemangiomas to more than 40 patients. However, adequate documentation was found for only 10 patients. After percutaneous electrocauterization of deep hemangiomas, discrete areas of skin necrosis appeared in some patients during the healing period, but the subsequent debridement and surgical excisions were easier because of the thrombosis effect of the technique due to the diffuse denaturation and fibrosis through and around the electrocauterization channels. The follow-up period was 1-13 years.\nThe proposed percutaneous electrocauterization technique for the treatment of deep hemangiomas achieved four effects: (1) volume reduction, (2) bleeding reduction, (3) anesthesia time reduction, and (4) cost reduction.

Subtotal splenectomy, preserving the upper spleen pole nourished only by splenogastric vessels is an alternative when the splenic pedicle must be ligated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of partial, subtotal and total splenectomies on the distribution of Escherichia coli in the mononuclear phagocytic system.\nThirty-two rats divided into four groups were studied: sham operation (total spleen preservation), partial splenectomy, subtotal splenectomy and total splenectomy. Five weeks after surgeries, an aliquot of E. coli marked with tecnetium-99m was injected intravenously. The animals were killed 20min later and the spleen, lungs and liver were removed in order to determine the distribution of labeled bacteria.\nThe amount of E. coli in the splenic tissue was greater in the intact spleen group than in the partial or subtotal splenectomy groups. Phagocytosis through the spleen did not differ between the partial and subtotal splenectomy groups. The amount of bacteria in the lungs was greater in the partial than in the subtotal splenectomy group. The distribution of labeled bacteria was greater in the liver of animals submitted to subtotal splenectomy than in the other groups.\nThe upper splenic pole, supplied only by splenogastric vessels, has the ability to remove live bacteria from the blood stream, showing that effective blood clearance occurs even without vascularization through the splenic pedicle.

A549-TPalpha cells induced greater tumor growth and increased vascularization in tumors than in the control A549 cells. Increased angiogenesis was further verified by studying the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in A549-TPalpha cells. I-BOP, an agonist of TP, stimulated the expression of VEGF in this cell line as well as in another human lung cancer H157 cells in a time and dose dependent manner. The expression of VEGF was determined at both the mRNA and protein levels. The signaling pathways that are involved in I-BOP-induced VEGF expression were further examined by the use of inhibitors. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation blocked the induction almost completely indicating that ERK activation was an essential step in the induction. Each of the three upstream kinases, protein kinase A, EGFR kinase and Src kinase, contributed partially to the overall induction. However, PI 3-kinase and protein kinase C had minimal contribution.

Recently endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been reported to circulate in substantial numbers under physiologic conditions and to contribute to bone regeneration. The authors investigated EPC mobilization in patients undergoing limb lengthening.\nThirteen of 24 consecutive patients who underwent limb-lengthening procedures on weight-bearing long bones (femur and tibia) were included in this study. Peripheral blood samples were taken at four different time points from each patient, that is, before operation (pre-Op), 2 or 3 days after osteotomy (early-PO), before the start of distraction (pre-Dist), and at 7 to 14 days after the start of distraction (during-Dist). Numbers of leukocytes and levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. After isolating mononuclear cells (MNCs) by centrifugation, we performed FACS analysis on freshly isolated MNCs using antibodies to the cell surface markers; CD34, CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and alkaline phosphatase. MNCs were also cultured in endothelial cell growth medium and numbers of EPC colony-forming units were counted. Plasma levels of EPC-mobilizing cytokines, such as, VEGF, SDF-1, and MCP-1, were determined by ELISA.\nNumbers of leukocytes and CRP plasma levels increased significantly during the early-PO period (p<0.01) but were maintained within normal range in the during-Dist period. FACS analysis of freshly isolated MNCs showed that EPC-enriched cell fractions increased after distraction, but that alkaline phosphatase-positive cell numbers were unchanged. Numbers of EPC colony-forming units significantly increased in the during-Dist period (p<0.01). Plasma levels of VEGF and SDF-1 significantly increased in the during-Dist period (p<0.05). In femoral lengthening patients whose healing index was less than 30 days/cm, the number of CFUs was 46.8 in the during-Dist period, whereas it was 12.7 in patients whose healing index was more than 30 days/cm (p=0.088).\nThis study demonstrates a mobilization of EPC population during distraction osteogenesis in human limb-lengthening patients.

In this paper we studied in rats whether a reduction in blood supply to the brain or neuroinflammation are possible mediators of this cognitive dysfunctionality. Methotrexate reduced hippocampal blood vessel density 1 week and 3 weeks after treatment as measured immunohistochemically with an endothelial barrier antigen. Since reduced brain vascularization may relate to lowered central glucose metabolism [(18)F]FDG PET was performed. Methotrexate reduced tracer uptake in the hippocampal region 1 week after treatment, which was not seen 3 weeks after treatment. Neuroinflammatory processes were explored via a number of methods: a microglia immunohistochemical marker was applied to hippocampal sections, [(11)C]PK11195 PET was performed, and cytokine levels in plasma and homogenized hippocampal tissue were measured. Methotrexate activated microglia in the hippocampus 1 week and 3 weeks after treatment. PET analysis, however, did not show an increase in hippocampal tracer uptake and the multiplex analysis of various cytokines showed that hippocampal cytokine levels were not increased after methotrexate administration.

Methotrexate reduces hippocampal blood vessel density, indicative of a reduced brain glucose metabolism, which may contribute to the cognitive impairment following methotrexate administration.

This abnormal and disproportionate hyper-vascularization is a compensatory mechanism to overcome an earlier phase of microvessel degeneration and reinstate metabolic equilibrium to the hypoxic retina.

Compared to other sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human fetal MSC (hfMSC) have recently been shown to be more proliferative and osteogenic. We studied the functional performance of hfMSC-mediated TEBG in 7 mm rat femoral critical-sized bone defects (CSD). Dynamically-cultured and osteogenically-primed hfMSC seeded onto macroporous poly-epsilon-caprolactone tri-calcium phosphate scaffolds were transplanted into CSDs. After 12 weeks, hfMSC-mediated TEBG induced 2.1x more new bone formation (43.3+/-10.5 vs. 21.0+/-7.4 mm(3), p<0.05), with greater compact and woven bone, and a 9.8x increase in stiffness (3.9+/-1.7 vs. 0.4+/-0.3 mNm/degree, p<0.05) compared to acellular scaffolds, such that only animals transplanted with TEBG underwent full fracture repair of the CSD. Although hfMSC survived for <4 weeks, by 4 weeks they were associated with a 3.9x larger vasculature network in the defect area (35.2+/-11.1 vs. 6.5+/-3.6 mm(3)p<0.05), suggesting an important role for hfMSC in the promotion of neo-vasculogenesis.

However, therapies based on inhibition of VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) have shown modest results for patients with cancer. Surprisingly little is known about mechanisms underlying the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression, the main targets of these drugs. Here, analysis of tissue microarrays revealed an inversely reciprocal pattern of VEGFR regulation in the endothelium of human squamous-cell carcinomas (high VEGFR1, low VEGFR2), as compared with the endothelium of control tissues (low VEGFR1, high VEGFR2). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that VEGF signals through the Akt/ERK pathway to inhibit constitutive ubiquitination and induce rapid VEGFR1 accumulation in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, VEGFR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of endothelial cells. In contrast, VEGF signals through the JNK/c-Jun pathway to induce endocytosis, nuclear translocation, and downregulation of VEGFR2 via ubiquitination. VEGFR1 signaling is required for endothelial-cell survival, while VEGFR2 regulates capillary tube formation. Notably, the antiangiogenic effect of bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) requires normalization of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in human squamous-cell carcinomas vascularized with human blood vessels in immunodeficient mice.

{"title": "Implanted microvessels progress through distinct neovascularization phenotypes.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that implanted microvessels form a new microcirculation with minimal host-derived vessel investment. Our objective was to define the vascular phenotypes present during neovascularization in these implants and identify post-angiogenesis events. Morphological, functional and transcriptional assessments identified three distinct vascular phenotypes in the implants: sprouting angiogenesis, neovascular remodeling, and network maturation. A sprouting angiogenic phenotype appeared first, characterized by high proliferation and low mural cell coverage. This was followed by a neovascular remodeling phenotype characterized by a perfused, poorly organized neovascular network, reduced proliferation, and re-associated mural cells. The last phenotype included a vascular network organized into a stereotypical tree structure containing vessels with normal perivascular cell associations. In addition, proliferation was low and was restricted to the walls of larger microvessels. The transition from angiogenesis to neovascular remodeling coincided with the appearance of blood flow in the implant neovasculature. Analysis of vascular-specific and global gene expression indicates that the intermediate, neovascular remodeling phenotype is transcriptionally distinct from the other two phenotypes. Therefore, this vascular phenotype likely is not simply a transitional phenotype but a distinct vascular phenotype involving unique cellular and vascular processes. Furthermore, this neovascular remodeling phase may be a normal aspect of the general neovascularization process. Given that this phenotype is arguably dysfunctional, many of the microvasculatures present within compromised or diseased tissues may not represent a failure to progress appropriately through a normally occurring neovascularization phenotype.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2009-10-17", "authors": ["Sara SNunes", "Kevin AGreer", "Chad MStiening", "Helen Y SChen", "Kameha RKidd", "Mark ASchwartz", "Chris JSullivan", "HarishRekapally", "James BHoying"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2009.10.001"}

At clinically compatible concentrations, ZA modulated the mevalonate pathway and affected protein prenylation in both tumour cells and macrophages.

{"title": "Intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants: mechanism of disease.", "abstract": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of prematurity. IVH typically initiates in the germinal matrix, which is a richly vascularized collection of neuronal-glial precursor cells in the developing brain. The etiology of IVH is multifactorial and is primarily attributed to the intrinsic fragility of the germinal matrix vasculature and the disturbance in the cerebral blood flow (CBF). Although this review broadly describes the pathogenesis of IVH, the main focus is on the recent development in molecular mechanisms that elucidates the fragility of the germinal matrix vasculature. The microvasculature of the germinal matrix is frail because of an abundance of angiogenic blood vessels that exhibit paucity of pericytes, immaturity of basal lamina, and deficiency of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the ensheathing astrocytes endfeet. High VEGF and angiopoietin-2 levels activate a rapid angiogenesis in the germinal matrix. The elevation of these growth factors may be ascribed to a relative hypoxia of the germinal matrix perhaps resulting from high metabolic activity and oxygen consumption of the neural progenitor cells. Hence, the rapid stabilization of the angiogenic vessels and the restoration of normal CBF on the first day of life are potential strategies to prevent IVH in premature infants.", "journal": "Pediatric research", "date": "2009-10-10", "authors": ["PraveenBallabh"], "doi": "10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181c1b176"}

The implants collected at day 9 postimplantation were processed for the assessment of hemoglobin, myeloperoxidase (MPO), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and collagen. Relevant inflammatory, angiogenic and fibrogenic cytokines were also determined. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant decrease in sponge vascularization (Hb content) and in VEGF levels at both doses. Neutrophil influx (MPO activity) was not affected by the compound whereas macrophage recruitment (NAG activity) was inhibited, suggesting a degree of selectivity by atorvastatin for this cell population. The level of CCL2 (MCP1-JE) was decreased only with 0.6 mg/kg. Atorvastatin was also able to reduce collagen deposition and the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) intraimplant, dose-dependently.

Although the effects of overexpressing angiogenic growth factors have been studied in inducing angiogenesis, the formation of functional vessels remains a challenge. The present study evaluates the reversal of diabetes-mediated impairment of angiogenesis in the infarcted diabetic rat myocardium by proangiogenic gene therapy.\nAd*VEGF and Ad*Ang1 were intramyocardially administered in combination immediately after myocardial infarction to nondiabetic and diabetic rats. Ad*LacZ was similarly administered to the respective control groups. The hearts were excised for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis at predetermined time points. The myocardial function was measured by echocardiography 30 days after the intervention.\nWe observed reduced fibrosis and increased capillary/arteriolar density along with reduced ventricular remodeling, as assessed by echocardiography in the treated diabetic animals compared with the nontreated diabetic controls. We also observed increased phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2, 2 days after the treatment and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flk-1, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Tie-2, and survivin, 4 days after treatment in the diabetic animals. Gel shift analysis revealed that the combination gene therapy stimulated the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB in the diabetic animals.\nOur preclinical data demonstrate the efficacy of coadministration of adenoviral VEGF and Ang-1 in increasing angiogenesis and reducing ventricular remodeling in the infarcted diabetic myocardium.

However, recipient vessels are often small rendering microvascular anastomosis difficult. We have developed a novel technique using retrograde flow through the branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery to use the proximal end of the artery as the recipient vessel. A vessel diameter of up to 5 mm is obtained providing a good match with the peroneal vessels. We used this technique to perform vascularized bone grafting of the femoral head in 10 patients with Ficat grade 2 and 3 osteonecrosis. Pulsatile retrograde flow from the lateral circumflex femoral artery was observed in each case. Retrospective review gave a median follow up of 52 months (range 17-99). Symptoms improved in all 10 cases. There was no radiological deterioration over the period of follow-up in eight cases.

However, generation of thick, three-dimensional liver tissue has been limited by the lack of vasculature in the tissue-engineered constructs. Here, we used collagen hydrogel as a matrix to generate engineered hepatic units to reconstitute three-dimensional, vascularized hepatic tissue in vivo. Hepatocytes harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats were mixed with liquid type I collagen, concentrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (2 x), and hepatocyte maintenance medium to create hepatocyte/collagen hydrogel constructs. The constructs were then dissociated into cylindrical hepatic units (diameter/height: 2000-4000 microm/500-1000 microm). Stacking of hepatic units under the subcutaneous space resulted in significant cell engraftment, with the formation of large fused hepatic system (more than 0.5 cm thickness) containing blood vessels. In contrast, only less cell engraftment could be achieved when hepatocytes were transplanted in a manner of whole constructs. Functional maintenance of the engineered hepatic tissue was confirmed by the expression of liver-specific mRNA and proteins. The engineered hepatic tissue has the ability to respond to the regenerative stimulus. In conclusion, large hepatic tissue containing blood vessels could be engineered in vivo by merging small hepatic units.

I use the same classification of diagnoses proposed in 1988, dividing the aesthetic alterations into five groups, and describe my experience during a 6-year period with 502 patients. I used vibroliposuction and performed plicature of the muscular aponeurosis through tunnels (where there are no important muscular perforator vessels), without damaging the vascularization. I propose an appropriate ratio of 1/1.5 between infra- and supraumbilical segments for uses in diagnosis and treatment, and the same ratio between the perimeter of the waist and the hips up to 1/1.618, known as the golden or divine proportion. According to this new treatment concept, vibroliposuction is used in GI. Vibroliposuction and suprapubic fusiform skin resection with an indigenous canoe shape are used in GII. Vibroliposuction, fusiform skin resection, and plicature of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis through two lateral tunnels are used in GIII. Vibroliposuction, fusiform skin resection, plicature of the rectus muscles aponeurosis through a medial tunnel, and detachment of the umbilicus aponeurotic implantation and reattachment in a maximum proportion of 1/1.6 between the infra- and supraumbilical skin segment with a bolster stitch are used in GIV. In GV, all the infraumbilical skin and a subcutaneous segment are removed after vibroliposuction, then a median tunnel from the umbilicus to the xiphoid process and a plicature of the rectus muscle aponeurosis from the pubis to the xiphoid process are made, and then the umbilicus is transposed.

{"title": "The significance of neuronal and glial cell changes in the rat retina during oxygen-induced retinopathy.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity is a devastating vascular disease of premature infants. A number of studies indicate that retinal function is affected in this disease. Using the rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, it is possible to explore more fully the complex relationship between neuronal, glial and vascular pathology in this condition. This review examines the structural and functional changes that occur in the rat retina following oxygen-induced retinopathy. We highlight that vascular pathology in rats is characterized by aberrant growth of blood vessels into the vitreous at the expense of blood vessel growth into the body of the retina. Moreover, amino acid neurochemistry, a tool for examining neuronal changes in a spatially complete manner reveals widespread changes in amacrine and bipolar cells. In addition, neurochemical anomalies within inner retinal neurons are highly correlated with the absence of retinal vessels. The key cell types that link blood flow with neuronal function are macroglia. Macroglia cells, which in the retina include astrocytes and M\u00fcller cells, are affected by oxygen-induced retinopathy. Astrocyte loss occurs in the peripheral retina, while M\u00fcller cells show signs of reactive gliosis that is highly localized to regions that are devoid of intraretinal blood vessels. Finally, we propose that treatments, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, that not only targets pathological angiogenesis, but that also promotes re-vascularization of the retina are likely to prove important in the treatment of those with retinopathy of prematurity.", "journal": "Documenta ophthalmologica.

Vascularized pedicle colonic conduit was most commonly used for esophageal substitution. Six hundred seventeen patients without a history of gastrectomy treated in the same period form the control group. After the operation, pathological characteristic, tumor staging, and survival statistics were analyzed.\nOf those patients with esophageal cancer associated with gastric remnant, the majority were male. There was an average of 16.5 years for diagnosing esophageal cancer from the initial partial gastrectomy, 75% (21/28) of them were patients with Billroth I anastomosis. The proportion of lower-third tumors in patients after gastrectomy (12 of 28 patients, 43%) was significantly higher compared with that of the patients with intact stomachs (124 of 617 patients, 20%; P = 0.004). After surgical treatment, the overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of gastrectomized and nongastrectomized patients were 100%, 35.00%, and 23.33% versus 98.93%, 59.42%, and 30.85% in stages I-II and 80.00%, 30.00%, and 0% versus 98.59%, 62.03%, and 21.03% in stages III-IV.

For patients with a history of distal gastrectomy, a vascularized pedicle colonic conduit was most commonly used for esophageal substitution. Surgical efficacy was similar with the no-gastrectomy group in early stages I-II of esophageal cancer associated with gastric remnant but was lower compared with the no-gastrectomy group in stages III-IV.

{"title": "Antiangiogenesis therapy might have the unintended effect of promoting tumor metastasis by increasing an alternative circulatory system.", "abstract": "Antiangiogenesis therapy is one of the most promising approaches to cancer treatment. Its clinical success has come out but still too limited. Vascularization of tumor is a complex and heterogenous process. So far, it has been demonstrated that several additional mechanisms can provide the tumor with oxygen and nutrients. Moreover, it is now clear that vascularization of tumor does not necessarily depend on endothelial cells proliferation and sprouting of new capillaries. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) as an alternative circulatory system, has been described in multiple malignant tumor types, and considered to be associated with a poor prognosis for the patient. VM serves as an adjunct to the existing vasculature system, thereby aiding tumor growth as well as contributing to the metastatic process. Moreover, hypoxia has been confirmed to promote some tumor cells to form vessel-like tubes in vitro and express genes associated with VM. Yet, the current antiangiogenesis strategies, which are directed mainly against the tumor endothelium and then cause hypoxia of tumor cells, have no effect on VM. Our central hypothesis is that when the endothelium-dependent vessels are inhibited by the effective angiogenesis inhibitors, the hypoxia of tumor cells caused by antiangiogenesis may increase VM compensatively which can replace the job of endothelium-dependent vessels to maintain the tumor blood supply and provide a convenient route of tumor metastasis. As a result, antiangiogenesis therapy might have the unintended effect of promoting tumor metastasis by increasing VM. Thus, treatment strategies that target the tumor microcirculation should not only target endothelium-dependent vessels, but also take VM into account in tumors presenting VM.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2009-09-12", "authors": ["BoQu", "LongGuo", "JinluMa", "YiLv"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2009.08.020"}

In this study, we tested the possibility of regenerating vascularized human dental pulp in emptied root canal space and producing new dentin on existing dentinal walls using a stem/progenitor cell-mediated approach with a human root fragment and an immunocompromised mouse model. Stem/progenitor cells from apical papilla and dental pulp stem cells were isolated, characterized, seeded onto synthetic scaffolds consisting of poly-D,L-lactide/glycolide, inserted into the tooth fragments, and transplanted into mice. Our results showed that the root canal space was filled entirely by a pulp-like tissue with well-established vascularity.

Two features distinguish adipose tissue from other organs--the ability to greatly expand its mass, via increases in cell size and/or number, and the wide anatomical distribution. While adipose tissue function is greatly affected by adipocyte size and anatomic location, regulations of adipocyte size, number, and body fat distribution are poorly understood. Transplantation of either mature adipose tissue or adipocyte progenitor cells has been used in studying adipocyte function and biogenesis. In this review, we will attempt to summarize methodological considerations for transplantation, including selections of donor material, transplantation site and the length of transplantation study, as well as effects of these factors and vascularization and innervation on the function of transplants. Specific studies are also reviewed to illustrate the utility of adipose tissue transplants in studying adipose tissue function and biogenesis. The focus is on studies in three areas: (1) use of transplants in demonstrating adipose tissue function, such as effects of adipose tissue transplants on metabolism and energy homeostasis of the recipient animals and depot-specific differences in adipose tissue function; (2) use of transplantation to dissect direct or cell-autonomous from indirect or non-cell-autonomous effects of leptin signaling and sex on adipocyte size; (3) use of transplantation in the identification of adipocyte progenitor cells and lineage analysis.

The mechanisms mediating these defects remain largely unknown at present, thus limiting the development of therapeutic approaches. Using a wound healing model, we here investigate the mechanisms by which IR exposure limits skin regeneration. Our data show that induction of the stromal cell-derived growth factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) is severely impaired in the wounded skin of irradiated, compared to non-irradiated, mice. Hence, we evaluated the potential of bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), which secrete high levels of SDF-1alpha, to improve skin regeneration in irradiated mice. Injection of MSCs into the wound margin led to remarkable enhancement of skin healing in mice exposed to IR. Injection of irradiated MSCs into the wound periphery of non-irradiated mice delayed wound closure, also suggesting an important role for the stromal microenvironment in skin repair. The beneficial actions of MSCs were mainly paracrine, as the cells did not differentiate into keratinocytes. Specific knockdown of SDF-1alpha expression led to drastically reduced efficiency of MSCs in improving wound closure, indicating that SDF-1alpha secretion by MSCs is largely responsible for their beneficial action. We also found that one mechanism by which SDF-1alpha enhances wound closure likely involves increased skin vascularization. Our findings collectively indicate that SDF-1alpha is an important deregulated cytokine in irradiated wounded skin, and that the decline in tissue regeneration potential following IR can be reversed, given adequate microenvironmental support.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2009-09-04", "authors": ["YannickLandry", "OanhL\u00ea", "Kimberly AMace", "Terry ERestivo", "Christian MBeaus\u00e9jour"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00887.x"}

Flow-cytometry analysis revealed that hTGSCs were positive for CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD166, but negative for CD34, CD45 and CD133, suggesting that these cells are mesenchymal-like stem cells. Under specific culture conditions, hTGSCs differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic and neurogenic cells, as well as formed tube-like structures in Matrigel assay. hTGSCs showed significant levels of expression of sox2 and c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA), and a very high level of expression of klf4 mRNA when compared with human embryonic stem cells. This study reports for the first time that hTGSCs express developmentally important transcription factors that could render hTGSCs an attractive candidate for future somatic cell re-programming studies to differentiate germs into various tissue types, such as neurons and vascular structures.

These were reproducibly expanded at high purity and subsequently seeded into biodegradable, fibrin-based hydrogels. The process of capillary formation in vitro followed the principles of both angiogenesis and postnatal vasculogenesis and a distinct sequence of other developmental steps that closely resemble embryonic neovascularization. Capillary lumen formation in vitro was initiated by the deposition of a basement membrane and intensive pinocytosis, followed by the generation of intracellular vacuoles, successive fusion of these vacuoles, and finally the formation of a long, continuous lumen. After transplantation the vascular structures were stabilized by mural cells of the recipient animal. Our findings suggest that the in vitro engineering of prevascularized matrices is within reach.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Free vascularized fibular transfer offers the potential for rapid autograft incorporation in limbs compromised by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients treated with free vascularized fibular graft reconstruction of large skeletal defects after tumor resections (mean defect length, 14.8 cm). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 4.9 years; range, 2-15 years). One patient died with liver and lung metastases at 3 years postoperatively. Loss of limb occurred in one patient. Five patients either had metastatic disease (one patient) or had metastatic disease (four patients) develop after treatment, with a mean time to metastasis of 18 months. The overall complication rate was 16 of 30 (53%), with a reoperation rate of 12 of 30 (40%). Union was attained in all 30 grafts. Primary union was attained in 23 (77%) at a mean of 6 months. Secondary union was achieved in seven (23%) after revision fixation and bone grafting; the mean subsequent time to union was 9.2 months, with an index of 1.33 additional operations per patient. Graft fracture (20%) and infection (10%) were other common complications.

{"title": "The effect of oxygen tension on the long-term osteogenic differentiation and MMP/TIMP expression of human mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells in tissue engineering to augment the repair of a variety of tissues including bone is a rapidly growing and exciting field. Although oxygen tension is a powerful stimulus for cells both in vitro and in vivo, the oxygen environment in which such cells would undergo differentiation is commonly overlooked. We examined the effect of long-term (21-days) low oxygen tension (1, 2 and 5%) on the osteogenic differentiation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) expression of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our data suggest that MSCs undergo osteoblastic differentiation most rapidly under 21% oxygen while oxygen tensions below 5% have an inhibitory effect. Interestingly, there was not a statistically significant difference in osteogenic markers between 5 and 21% oxygen. In addition, our data suggest that oxygen tension affects the expression of individual MMP and TIMPs differently. Low oxygen tension has an inhibitory effect on MMP-13 and TIMP-1 expression, which are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and potentially vascular invasion. In contrast, MMP-2, a metalloproteinase involved in cell migration was not affected by oxygen tension. This data suggests that 21% oxygen may be beneficial for rapid osteogenic differentiation as would be required for the production of individual patient ex vivo constructs. In addition, this has important in vivo implications relating to the importance of early vascularization of sites of orthopedic injury. By augmenting the neovascularization process, it may be possible to facilitate more rapid differentiation of progenitors and thus the repair process.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2009-08-20", "authors": ["Leah FRaheja", "Damian CGenetos", "Clare EYellowley"], "doi": "10.1159/000235679"}

An experimental model for immunotolerance studies should sustain a high antigenicity with low morbidity. Accordingly, we introduced an iliac bone osteomusculocutaneous (IBOMC) transplant model in rat. It consists of a large skin component and an abundant bone marrow cells (BMC) population. We tested this model with isograft transplantations between Lewis rats (RT1(l)) and with allograft transplantation between Lewis-Brown Norway (LBN RT1(l + n)) donors and Lewis (RT1(l)) recipients under low dose of cyclosporine A monotherapy. Immunologic responses were tested for donor cell engraftment and chimerism induction. All isografts survived indefinitely and allografts were viable at 200 days post-transplant under low dose of cyclosporine A. Microangiography of the graft revealed preservation of skin, muscle, and bone components. Histologic examination confirmed viability of all allograft components without signs of rejection. Long-term engraftment of donor-origin (RT1(n)) BMC was confirmed by donor-specific chimerism (1.2%) in peripheral blood and bone marrow (1.65%) compartments and by engraftment into lymphoid organs of recipients.

Clinical parameters [plaque index, probing depth, bleeding on probing (BOP), origin of peri-implant soft tissue, and amount of irradiation] were recorded, and microbiological identification of periodontal pathogens was carried out by DNA-DNA hybridization. To identify yeast species, the samples were cultivated on Sabouraud agar plates and subsequently identified by API 20C AUX plates. An implant site showing BOP, probing pocket depth (PPD)>or=5 mm and radiographic vertical bone loss was considered to have peri-implant disease.\nColonization by periodontal pathogens was found on 15 implants, while yeast species were found in 14 cases. Using a univariate analysis, none of the investigated parameters (microbiologic sign, detection of yeast, origin of peri-implant soft tissue and irradiation) were significantly correlated to signs of peri-implant disease. In the multivariate analysis, yeast [odds ratio (OR) 12.32, P=0.033] and periodontal pathogen (OR 9.88, P=0.046) were significant predictor variables for peri-implant disease.

Yeast and periodontal pathogen were explanatory variables for the development of peri-implant disease.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most potent of a suite of growth factors responsible for uterine vascularization in mammals. We have sequenced VEGF mRNA transcripts expressed in the uterus of oviparous and viviparous Australian skinks, and compared uterine VEGF expression in nonreproductive and late-reproductive Saiphos equalis, a fossorial viviparous skink. VEGF sequences differed between phylogenetic groups of skinks, rather than oviparous and viviparous skinks. Two transcripts were identified in the uterus of each species that had the same splice sites as human VEGF(165) and VEGF(189). A third transcript, found only in uterine and testis tissue from S. equalis, had the same splice sites as human VEGF(111). This is the first natural expression of VEGF(111), previously found only in human cultured cells subjected to environmental stress. All the three VEGF transcripts identified showed higher expression in uterus from late-reproductive S. equalis than nonreproductive females.

The aim of this study was to determine whether delayed myoblast implantation, at day 4 or 7, improves myoblast survival compared with implantation at day 0 in an in vivo arterio-venous loop (AB loop) chamber model. In adult inbred Sprague-Dawley rats, an AB loop was inserted into a plastic chamber (day 0). In Group I, day 0, two million DiI-labeled (neonatal inbred) myoblasts were implanted around the AB loop. In Groups II and III, day 0, the AB loop was created and inserted into a novel delayed cell seeding chamber, and 4 (Group II) or 7 days (Group III) later the delay chamber was seeded with 2 million DiI-labeled myoblasts. Constructs were harvested 7-day postmyoblast implantation, for morphometric determination of DiI/DAPI-positive myoblasts/mm(2), and percent vascular volume on Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (endothelial cell marker)-labeled tissue sections. Control (nonmyoblast seeded) and experimental (myoblast seeded) constructs demonstrated similar capillary and tissue growth patterns. DiI/DAPI-labeled myoblasts/mm(2) appeared in similar numbers in constructs implanted at days 0 and 4, but increased markedly in day-7 implanted constructs. The percent vascular volume increased significantly (p = 0.03) over time. A positive correlation existed between myoblast survival and construct vascularity (p = 0.017).

In addition, we investigated the mechanisms leading to the support of endothelial organization by these cells. We cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), ASCs, and BMSCs either alone or in combination in fibrin-embedded spheroids for 14 days. We found that BMSCs and ASCs formed cellular networks that expressed alpha smooth muscle actin and, in the case of ASCs, also CD34. Further, BMSCs and ASCs secreted hepatocyte growth factor and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and 2. In addition, ASC-conditioned medium induced HUVEC outgrowth, whereas BMSC-conditioned medium and hepatocyte growth factor-supplemented medium did not. Finally, both BMSCs and ASCs supported HUVEC organization into prevascular-like structures when cocultured.

{"title": "Hypoxic preconditioning of human mesenchymal stem cells overcomes hypoxia-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation.", "abstract": "Osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into osteoblasts is a prerequisite for subsequent bone formation. Numerous studies have explored osteogenic differentiation under standard tissue culture conditions, which usually employ 21% of oxygen. However, bone precursor cells such as hMSCs reside in stem cell niches of low-oxygen atmospheres. Furthermore, they are subjected to low oxygen concentrations when cultured on three-dimensional scaffolds in vitro, and even more so after transplantation when vascularization has yet to be established. Similarly, hMSCs are exposed to low oxygen in the fracture microenvironment following bony injury. Recent studies revealed that hypoxic preconditioning improves cellular engraftment and survival in low-oxygen atmospheres. In our study we investigated the osteogenic differentiation potential of hMSCs under 2% O(2) (hypoxia) in comparison to a standard tissue culture oxygen atmosphere of 21% (normoxia). We assessed the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs following hypoxic preconditioning to address whether this pretreatment is beneficial for subsequent differentiation processes as well. To validate our findings we carefully characterized the extent of hypoxia exerted and its effect on cell survival and proliferation. We found that hMSCs proliferate better if cultured under 2% of oxygen. We confirmed that osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs is indeed inhibited if osteogenic induction is carried out under constant hypoxia. Finally, we showed for the first time that hypoxic preconditioning of hMSCs prior to osteogenic induction restores osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, our results indicate that maintaining constant levels of oxygen improves the osteogenic potential of hMSCs and suggest that low oxygen concentrations may preserve the stemness of hMSCs.

Scaffolds were seeded with hMSCs for culture in osteogenic conditions or subcutaneous implantation into nude rats. Compressive moduli increased with HA content in a near-linear fashion. The osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs increased in a dose-dependent manner as determined by alkaline phosphatase activity and osteopontin secretion after 4 weeks of culture. Further, endogenous secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor was sustained at significantly higher levels over 28 days for hMSCs seeded in 2.5:1 and 5:1 HA:PLG scaffolds. Eight weeks after implantation, scaffolds with higher HA:PLG ratios exhibited greater vascularization and more mineralized tissue.

Studies using 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and 50/10 OIR+SO models were reviewed. Repeated fluctuations in oxygen increased retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) even while peripheral avascular retina persisted and prior to the development of intravitreous neovascularization. Repeated fluctuations in oxygen increased VEGF(164) expression but not VEGF(120). Neutralizing VEGF bioactivity significantly reduced intravitreous neovascularization and arteriolar tortuosity without interfering with ongoing retinal vascularization. Repeated oxygen fluctuations led to retinal hypoxia and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibiting ROS with NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, reduced avascular retina by interfering with apoptosis. Supplemental oxygen reduced retinal VEGF concentration and exacerbated NADPH oxidase activation to contribute to intravitreous neovascularization through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Oxygen stresses relevant to those experienced by preterm infants today trigger signaling of different pathways to cause avascular retina and intravitreous neovascularization. Increased signaling of VEGF appears important to the development of both avascular retina and intravitreous neovascularization.", "journal": "Documenta ophthalmologica.

The biological activity of VEGF binding on heparinized collagen was demonstrated by promoting endothelial cells proliferation. Evaluation of the angiogenic potential of heparinized DBM loaded with VEGF was further investigated by subcutaneous implantation. Improved angiogenesis of heparinized DBM loaded with VEGF was observed from haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry examination.

Patients with a diagnosis of ODG, consecutively treated in a single institution, were reviewed and reclassified according to WHO and Daumas-Duport grading systems.

Tissue sections were used for pathology review and to evaluate immunostaining of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R), Ki-67, and CD34. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the impact of tumor angiogenesis-related pathological and radiological factors on patient survival. One hundred thirty-four patients with pure ODG were included in this study. Multivariate analysis identified four independent poor prognostic factors: necrosis, absence of seizure, increased vascularization, and age >55 years. A subgroup of patients with tumor necrosis, increased vascularization, and absence of seizures had a significantly worse outcome than predicted, with a median overall survival of 14.2 months. VEGF expression was significantly higher in this subgroup and correlated with disease progression regardless of histologic grade. Based on the presence of radiological or pathological necrosis, contrast enhancement or endothelial hyperplasia, and absence of seizures, a high risk group of ODG can be identified with significantly worse overall survival.

{"title": "Increased angiogenesis induced by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells is mediated by leukemia-derived Ang2 and VEGF.", "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that angiogenic signalling pathways play important role in the patho-biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our goal was to investigate: (i) the spontaneous and hypoxia-induced production of pro-angiogenic factors, VEGF and Ang2, by Real-time PCR and ELISA, (ii) the degree of vascularization in CLL-infiltrated bone marrow (BM) compartment by CD34 immunohistochemical staining of microvessels and (iii) the direct angiogenic effect of CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2 by function-blocking experiments in Matrigel assays. The results demonstrated that CLL cells spontaneously express both VEGF and Ang2 and are able to secrete these factors in surrounding microenvironment. Full-length Ang2 mRNA and truncated form Ang2(443) were detectable. Moreover, CLL cells were shown to enhance secretion of both VEGF and Ang2 proteins when subjected to hypoxic condition. Furthermore, increased in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis was induced by CLL cells. Enhanced BM vascularity correlated with Ig-unmutated CLL subset and increased expression of Ang2. Then, we demonstrated that supernatants obtained from CLL cells significantly increase the HUVEC tube formation in Matrigel assays and that this enhanced angiogenic capacity is mediated by both CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2. Taken together, these results suggest that several simultaneous mechanisms may be involved in the CLL capacity to induce the disruption of pre-existing vessel structures to give rise to tumor neoangiogenesis. The preliminary studies in solid tumors, showing that the disruption of Ang2 function can inhibit tumor vessel density and growth, are encouraging and suggest the possibility of new future therapeutic options targeting CLL microenvironment.", "journal": "Leukemia research", "date": "2009-07-21", "authors": ["RossanaMaffei", "SilviaMartinelli", "IlariaCastelli", "RitaSantachiara", "PatriziaZucchini", "MarcellaFontana", "StefaniaFiorcari", "GorettaBonacorsi", "FiorellaIlariucci", "GiuseppeTorelli", "RobertoMarasca"], "doi": "10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.023"}

{"title": "Evaluation of photo-crosslinked fibrinogen as a rapid and strong tissue adhesive.", "abstract": "Tissue adhesives and sealants are commonly used in surgery either as an adjunct to, or replacement for, sutures. Previously, we have shown that fibrinogen can be crosslinked rapidly to give a high-strength bond in the presence of a ruthenium(II) complex, a persulfate and irradiation with visible light, and that the crosslinked fibrinogen is nontoxic to cells in vitro. This approach addresses limitations to current fibrin sealants that typically have relatively slow curing times and low bond strengths. In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of this new biological scaffold sealant in various animal models. When placed as solid implants into rats, the crosslinked fibrinogen persisted for at least 8 weeks but was fully resorbed by 18 weeks with minimal inflammatory responses. When used as a tissue adhesive for repair of skin incisions in rats or as an arterial haemostat in pig, the photo-crosslinked fibrinogen sealed tissue or arrested bleeding within 20 s of application. For the skin incisions, the fibrinogen sealant promoted rapid tissue vascularization and cellular infiltration with no adverse foreign body cell generation. New collagen deposition occurred and with time the matrix had remodelled to acquire large mature collagen fiber bundles which were accompanied by maximum regenerated tensile strength.

These conditions were in the presence or absence of heparin and/or bone marrow cells. By 30 days, very few cell infiltrations were observed in the dorsal subcutaneous and peritoneal implants at any conditions; however, the presence of heparin and bone marrow cells improved cell infiltration toward an inflammatory reaction. The insertion of an arteriovenous bundle into the central cavity of the scaffold resulted in partial wound tissue infiltration in the control scaffolds implanted subcutaneously in the hind limb. In similar conditions, the presence of bone marrow cells and heparin resulted in dense wound tissue with numerous capillaries and a significant amount of newly deposited collagen fibers.

{"title": "Selective upregulation of interleukin-8 by human rhabdomyosarcomas in response to hypoxia: therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of adolescence and childhood. Because RMS tumors are highly vascularized, we sought to determine which factors secreted by RMS cells are crucial in stimulating angiogenesis in response to hypoxia. To address this issue, we evaluated expression of several proangiogenic factors [interleukin (IL)-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)] in 8 human RMS cell lines in both normal steady-state and hypoxic conditions. We found by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that from all the factors evaluated, IL-8, whose expression is very low in normoxia, had been very highly expressed and secreted by RMS cells lines during hypoxic conditions ( approximately 40-170 times). Interestingly, this upregulation was not affected by knocking down hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, but was inhibited by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)p42/44 and phosphatidylinositaol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway inhibitors. This suggests that IL-8 expression is regulated in an activating protein (AP)-1- and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that conditioned media (CM) harvested from RMS cells exposed to hypoxia activated and stimulated chemotactic responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and that IL-8 was responsible for hypoxia-related effects. Finally, by employing shRNA, the expression of IL-8 in human RH-30 cells was downregulated. We noticed that such RMS cells, if injected into skeletal muscles of immunodeficient mice, have a reduced ability for tumor formation. We conclude that IL-8 is a pivotal proangiogenic factor released by human RMS cells in hypoxic conditions and that the targeting of IL-8 may prove to be a novel and efficient strategy for inhibiting RMS growth.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2009-07-10", "authors": ["MarcinWysoczynski", "Dong-MyungShin", "MagdaKucia", "Mariusz ZRatajczak"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.24732"}

Three groups were compared: MAA beads, control poly(methyl methacrylate) beads (PMMA), and no bead blanks. MAA bead treatment significantly increased percent wound closure at all timepoints (7, 14, and 21 days) with MAA bead-treated wounds almost closed at day 21 (91 +/- 5.4% MAA vs. 79 +/- 3.2% PMMA or 76 +/- 4.8% no beads; p < 0.05). This was consistent with the expected significant increase in vascularity in the MAA group at days 7 and 14.

Epithelial gap and migration measurements suggested that the increased vascularity leads to enhanced epithelial cell migration as a principal means of wound closure.

Previous studies suggest that the ECM scaffold remodeling process is dependent on microenvironmental factors, including tissue-specific biomechanical loading. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of long-term catheterization (LTC), with its associated inhibition of bladder filling and physiologic biomechanical loading, on ECM scaffold remodeling following partial cystectomy in a canine model. Reconstruction of the partial cystectomy site was performed using ECM scaffolds prepared from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM). Animals were randomly assigned to either a long-term catheterization (LTC) group (n=5, catheterized 28 d) or a short-term catheterization group (STC, n=5, catheterized 24 h), and scaffold remodeling was assessed by histologic methods at 4 and 12 wk postoperatively. By 4 wk, animals in the STC group showed a well-developed and highly differentiated urothelium, a robust vascularization network, abundant smooth muscle actin (SMA), and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (smMHC) expressing spindle-shaped cells, and many neuronal processes associated with newly formed arterioles. In contrast, at 4 wk the scaffolds in LTC animals were not epithelialized, and did not express neuronal markers. The scaffolds in the LTC group developed a dense granulation tissue containing SMA+, smMHC-, spindle-shaped cells that were morphologically and phenotypically consistent with myofibroblasts, but not smooth muscle cells. By 12 wk postoperatively, the ECM scaffolds in the STC animals showed a constructive remodeling response, with a differentiated urothelium and islands of smooth muscle cells within the remodeled scaffold. In contrast, at 12 wk the scaffolds in LTC animals had a remodeling response more consistent with fibrosis even though catheters had been removed 8 wk earlier.

To evaluate the ability of IFI16 to inhibit in vivo tumorigenesis of HNO136 cells and to characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for its anti-tumor activity, IFI16 expression on cell growth was evaluated by an in vivo tumorigenicity assay. After excision, tumors were subjected to morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses with markers of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Restoring IFI16 expression significantly reduced the in vivo tumorigenesis of HNO136, decreased tumor vascularization and increased areas of tumor necrosis. Further analysis revealed that IFI16 expression triggered apoptosis of tumor cells, as evaluated using TUNEL assay. Finally, restoring IFI16 protein to HNO136 cells increased CD45+ inflammatory cell infiltration of the tumor burden, predominantly consisting of CD68/CD14 positive macrophages.

However, relatively little is known about the role of glial cells during pathological retinal neovascularization (NV), a leading contributor to vision loss in industrialized nations. We demonstrate that the loss of astrocytes and microglia directly correlates with the development of pathological NV in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). These two distinct glial cell populations were found to have cooperative survival effects in vitro and in vivo. The intravitreal injection of myeloid progenitor cells, astrocytes, or astrocyte-conditioned media rescued endogenous astrocytes from degeneration that normally occurs within the hypoxic, vaso-obliterated retina following return to normoxia. Protection of the retinal astrocytes and microglia was directly correlated with accelerated revascularization of the normal retinal plexuses and reduction of pathological intravitreal NV normally associated with OIR. Using astrocyte-conditioned media, several factors were identified that may contribute to the observed astrocytic protection and subsequent normalization of the retinal vasculature, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Injection of VEGF or bFGF at specific doses rescued the retinas from developing OIR-associated pathology, an effect that was also preceded by protection of endogenous glia from hypoxia-induced degeneration. Together, these data suggest that vascular-associated glia are also required for normalized revascularization of the hypoxic retina.

{"title": "Tumor perfusion assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI correlates to the grading of renal cell carcinoma: initial results.", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether assessment of the tumor perfusion by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) enables to estimate the morphologic grading of renal cell carcinomas. A total of 21 patients with suspected renal cell cancer were examined using a Gadobutrol-enhanced, dynamic saturation-recovery, turbo-fast, low-angle shot sequence. Tumor perfusion and the tissue-blood ratio within the entire tumor and the most highly vascularized part of the tumor were calculated according to the model of Miles. Immediately after examination, patients underwent surgery, and the results from imaging were compared with the morphological analysis of the histologic grading. Fourteen patients had G2 tumors, and seven patients had G3 tumors. Significantly higher perfusion values (p<0.05) were obtained in G3 tumors than in G2 tumors when the entire tumor area was considered (1.59+/-0.44(ml/g/min) vs. 1.08+/-0.38(ml/g/min)) or its most highly vascularized part (2.14+/-0.89(ml/g/min) vs. 1.40+/-0.49(ml/g/min)). By contrast, the tissue-blood ratios did not differ significantly between the two groups. In conclusion, unlike tissue-blood ratio, surrogate parameters of the tumor perfusion determined by DCE MRI seem to allow an estimation of the grading of renal cell carcinoma.

Following implantation, we used intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry to analyze the biocompatibility, neovascularization, and incorporation of each material over a time period of 2 weeks. Biocompatibility was good in all groups, as indicated by the absence of leukocyte activation upon implantation. All groups displayed angiogenic response in the host tissue, but that response was highest in the polyglycolic acid group. Histology revealed vascularized granulation tissue surrounding all three biomaterials, with many proliferating cells and a lack of apoptotic cell death 2 weeks after implantation.

The kidney is a highly vascularized organ and has two important microvasculatures; glomerular and peritubular capillaries. Loss of these capillaries is strongly associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease. In several kidney disease animal models, VEGF expression in the kidney is decreased and administration of VEGF is protective. Recent clinical observations revealed that blocking VEGF by endogenous inhibitor (soluble Flt-1) in preeclampsia and monoclonal antibody against VEGF in cancer patients cause proteinuria and renal dysfunction. However, plasma VEGF levels in diabetic nephropathy patients are increased and blocking VEGF improved diabetic nephropathy in animal models. Increased plasma VEGF levels have been reported in CKD patients. Deleterious effects of VEGF have been demonstrated in atherosclerosis and sepsis, which are frequent complications in CKD patients.

{"title": "Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the endometrium during menstrual cycle and implantation.", "abstract": "Blood vessels develop via two subsequent processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, both being of crucial importance during menstrual cycle and implantation. These processes are also involved in the development of the fetal and placental vasculatures. During vasculogenesis, formation of the earliest primitive capillaries is achieved by in situ differentiation of hemangiogenic stem cells that are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal cells. The subsequent process, angiogenesis, is characterized by development of new vessels from already existing vessels, and is a well coordinated process initiated by stimulation of various growth factors. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are important and complex processes involving extensive interplay between cells and growth factors. The development, maturation and maintenance of the vascular network are necessary for successful hemochorial placentation as well as normal embryonic development and growth. In this review, we outline the basic mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle and different stages of implantation, and consider how this data can be applied to human pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that during the initiation steps of implantation, angiogenic factors trigger vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Different inducers and stimulators affect angiogenesis and vasculogenesis by directly or indirectly stimulating proliferation, differentiation and migration of endothelial or respective precursor cells. As a conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the roles of angiogenic factors during the menstrual cycle and implantation may provide new insights and possible approaches for embryo implantation and healthy pregnancy.", "journal": "Acta histochemica", "date": "2009-06-02", "authors": ["RamazanDemir", "AylinYaba", "BertholdHuppertz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acthis.2009.04.004"}

{"title": "Fascicular turnover flap for nerve gaps.", "abstract": "It is well known that free vascularised nerve grafts have a potential for rapid axonal sprouting. However, they are not very popular as the surgical techniques are complicated. With the recent development of supramicrosurgical techniques and microanatomy of nerve trunks, a new method, 'fascicular turnover method', using vascularised fascicular flap was used for repairing nerve gaps. METHODSAND RESULTS: Arterial embalming method, using rat sciatic nerves, was employed to observe fascicular micro-vascularisation. Rich vascular network systems were observed within and outside the rat island nerve flaps. Four cases with digital and facial nerves gaps were repaired with fascicular turnover flap without a nerve graft. Three patients had digital nerve gaps (10-20mm in length) and one had a 3-cm facial nerve gap. The results of sensory recovery of digital nerve gap were 3.22-3.66 (Semmes-Weinstein values) and 6-12mm (moving two-point discriminations) at 6 and -16 months after surgery, respectively.\nThe advantages of this method are: retention of the normal donor nerve, a shorter operation time and repair of the digital nerve gaps under local anaesthesia. Fascicular flap is a vascularised nerve flap with fast and accurate nerve sprouting in comparison to a non-vascularised graft. Excellent nerve regeneration can be expected even in cases with longer nerve gap and scarred recipient bed. It is a simple and quick surgery compared to free vascularised nerve flaps.

Kidneys are particularly vulnerable to drug toxicity, especially since they are highly vascularized, thus receiving about 25% of cardiac output. Furthermore, interstitial accumulation of toxic agents in papilla and the medulla often occurs due to the existence of a corticomedullary osmotic gradient. Moreover, the key role played by the renal tubule in the reabsorption processes of a number of endogenous and exogenous substances further increases the exposure of the kidney to high concentrations of potentially toxic agents, both in the tubular lumen and cells. As a result, drugs may be toxic to all of the four structures of the kidney: glomerulus, tubule, interstitium, and blood vessels.

The aim of this study was to objectively assess if there were differences in the immune response to CSG and primarily vascularized skin in composite tissue allotransplants (SCTT) using in vivo techniques in order to gain new insights in to the immune response to skin allotransplants. CSG and SCTT were transplanted from standard Lewis (LEW) ad Wistar Furth (WF) to recipient transgenic green fluorescent Lewis rats (LEW-GFP). In vivo confocal microscopy was used to observe cell trafficking within skin of the transplants. In addition, immunohistochemical staining was performed on skin biopsies to reveal possible expression of class II major histocompatibility antigens. A difference was observed in the immune response to SCTT compared to CSG. SCTT had a greater density cellular infiltrate than CSG (p<0.03) that was focused more at the center of the transplant (p<0.05) than at the edges, likely due to the immediate vascularization of the skin. Recipient dendritic cells were only observed in rejecting SCTT, not CSG. Furthermore, dermal endothelial class II MHC expression was only observed in allogeneic SCTT. The immune response in both SCTT and CSG was focused on targets in the dermis, with infiltrating cells clustering around hair follicles (CSG and SCTT; p<0.01) and blood vessels (SCTT; p<0.01) in allogeneic transplants. This study suggests that there are significant differences between rejection of SCTT and CSG that may limit the relevance of much of the historical data on skin graft rejection when applied to composite tissue allotransplantation.

Complications were recorded, and range of motion analysis was performed comparing operated and non-operated sides during follow-up appointments.\nThe descending branch muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap was used for reconstruction of: the chest wall (2), axilla (2) and upper extremity (1). The skin paddles harvested ranged from 15 x 7cm to 24 x 9cm. All donor sites were closed primarily. There was one case of minor wound dehiscence on the donor site and one case of wound infection (reconstruction was for chronic, severe axillary hidradenitis suppuritiva). There were no incidences of seroma. In all cases, there was no difference in strength or range of motion around the shoulder joint when comparing the operated to the non-operated side.\nThe pedicled descending branch muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap with a transversely orientated skin paddle results in minimal functional deficit of the donor site, absence of seroma, low rate of flap complications and an aesthetically acceptable scar.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2009-03-24", "authors": ["CorrineWong", "MichelSaint-Cyr"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2009.01.059"}
{"title": "Morpho-physical recording of bovine conceptus (Bos indicus) and placenta from days 20 to 70 of pregnancy.", "abstract": "The study is based on 141 pregnant Bos indicus cows, from days 20 to 70 post-insemination. First, special attention was given to the macroscopically observable phenomena of attachment of the conceptus to the uterus, i.e. the implantation, from about days 20 to 30 post-insemination up to day 70, and placentome development by growth, vascularization and increase in the number of cotyledons opposite to the endometrial caruncles. Secondly, as for the conceptuses, semiquantitative, statistical analyses were performed of the lengths of chorio-allantois, amnion and yolk sac; and the different parts of the centre and two extremes of the yolk sacs were also analysed. Thirdly, the embryos/foetuses corresponding to their membranes were measured by their greatest length and by weight, and described by the appearance of external developmental phenomena during the investigated period like neurulation, somites, branchial arcs, brain vesicles, limb buds, C-form, pigmented eye and facial grooves. In conclusion, all the data collected in this study from days 20 to 70 of bovine pregnancy were compared extensively with corresponding data of the literature. This resulted in an 'embryo/foetal age-scale', which has extended the data in the literature by covering the first 8 to 70 days of pregnancy. This age-scale of early bovine intrauterine development provides model for studies, even when using slaughtered cows without distinct knowledge of insemination or fertilization time, through macroscopic techniques. This distinctly facilitates research into the cow, which is now being widely used as 'an experimental animal' for testing new techniques of reproduction like in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer and cloning.", "journal": "Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene", "date": "2009-03-14", "authors": ["A CAssis Neto", "F T VPereira", "T CSantos", "C EAmbrosio", "RLeiser", "M AMiglino"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0531.2009.01345.x"}
{"title": "Dermis-derived hydrogels support adipogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Biomaterials that support adipogenesis could contribute to tissue engineering therapies to be used as alternatives to traditional methods of tissue reconstruction and regeneration. We have recently shown that hydrogels comprised of urea soluble proteins and polysaccharides extracted from adipose tissue promote preadipocyte differentiation in vitro and adipogenesis in vivo. However, it is not clear if these findings result from the adipose tissue source of the extracts or if the technique isolates adipogenic factors from other tissues. The present study investigates whether the application of this technique to dermis samples would provide adipogenic hydrogels. Extracts from dermis assembled into hydrogels by either temperature or pH mechanisms. Both formulations supported preadipocyte differentiation in vitro and vascularized adipose formation in vivo. The temperature formulation of the gels induced more rapid adipose formation than the pH formulation in vivo. Interestingly, in comparison to our previous studies the dermis derived hydrogels had comparable adipogenic properties to adipose gels in vivo but not in vitro. Further study of these materials could lead to insight of the role of specific matrix properties on adipogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Free serratus anterior fascia flap for reconstruction of hand and finger defects.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the dorsal surface of hand defects requires thin, pliable, well vascularized tissue with a gliding surface for the extensor tendon course. Also defects of the palmar hand and degloved fingers need non-bulky soft tissue for reconstruction. We present a retrospective analysis of nine patients with free serratus anterior fascia flaps used to cover defects of the palmar and dorsal hand and of degloved fingers.\nThree of the patients presented limited range of hand motion due to full-thickness burns; one patient had defects of the dorsum of one hand after acute burn injury. Two patients had an acute trauma of the dorsum of the hand with extensor tendon injury, another patient a soft-tissue defect of his thumb and dorsal hand due to an avulsion injury. One patient presented dorsal defect of three fingers after degloving injury. One patient had a palmar defect after industrial crush injury with exposed tendons, vessels, and nerves. The flaps were applied as pure fascial flaps with an immediate partial-thickness skin graft.\nOne patient presented a partial necrosis of <10% flap size. All other flaps survived completely. Two of the patients presented wound healing problems of the skin graft that healed secondarily. All patients recovered useful hand function without a bulky contour of their hand or fingers. Except for the scar, no donor-site morbidity was reported.\nThe free serratus anterior fascia flap has good functional and cosmetic properties and there is low donor-site morbidity. It is an excellent flap for soft-tissue reconstruction combined with extensor tendon reconstruction on the dorsum of the hand. The flap is also very useful for palmar and finger defects.", "journal": "Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery", "date": "2009-03-10", "authors": ["DietmarUlrich", "PaulFuchs", "AhmedBozkurt", "NorbertPallua"], "doi": "10.1007/s00402-009-0845-5"}

The aim of this study was to investigate morphological and physiological alterations in the terminal branches of the superior rectal artery (SRA) in patients with haemorrhoidal disease treated by stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH) using noninvasive transperineal ultrasound.\nThirty-seven consecutive patients (14 women, 23 men; median age 52, range 30-77 years) who underwent SH for treatment of grade III haemorrhoids were scanned by transperineal colour Doppler ultrasound at baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. Seventeen healthy volunteers served as the control group (nine women, eight men; median age 24, range 18-72 years). Calibre and arterial flow velocity (AFV) of the terminal branches of the SRA were measured.\nBaseline measurements significantly differed between patients and the control group (median calibre 2, range 0.9-3.6 mm, vs 1, range 0.6-1.2 mm, and median AFV 24, range 10-65 cm/s, vs 12, range 5-21 cm/s, P < 0.0001). Postoperative follow-up showed no significant alterations in the physiological parameters. Patients with a higher recurrence rate of haemorrhoidal disease had higher baseline AFV values.\nStapled haemorrhoidopexy does not reduce arterial inflow in the feeding vessels of the anorectal vascular plexus.

Collagen I (coll I)- and collagen I/chondroitin sulfate (coll I/CS)-coated PHB scaffolds were seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Proliferation and differentiation were characterized by different biochemical assays in vitro. For animal experiments, the cells were cultivated on coll I- or coll I/CS-coated scaffolds and either expanded or osteogenically differentiated. Scaffolds were piled up to create a 3D scaffold pad and implanted subcutaneously into nude rats. In vitro hMSC showed proliferation and differentiation on PHB scaffolds. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium increased in the differentiation medium and in the presence of coll I/CS. In vivo blood vessels were found in the scaffold-stack. Histological/immunohistological analyses of explanted scaffolds showed osteogenic markers such as osteopontin, osteonectin, and coll I around the PHB fibers. Coll I/CS-coated scaffolds with expanded hMSC showed higher values of ALP and calcium than the other combinations.

{"title": "Bioactivation of collagen matrices through sustained VEGF release from PLGA microspheres.", "abstract": "The success of any tissue engineering implant relies upon prompt vascularization of the cellular construct and, hence, on the ability of the scaffold to broadcast specific activation of host endothelium and guide vessel ingrowth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic stimulator, and if released in a controlled manner it may enhance and guide scaffold vascularization. Therefore, the aim of this work was to realize a scaffold with integrated depots able to release VEGF in a controlled rate and assess the ability of this scaffold to promote angiogenesis. VEGF-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres were produced and included in a collagen scaffold. The release of VEGF from microspheres was tailored to be sustained over several weeks and occurred at a rate of approximately 0.6 ng/day per mg of microspheres. It was found that collagen scaffolds bioactivated with VEGF-loaded microspheres strongly enhanced endothelial cell activation and vascular sprouting both in vitro and in vivo as compared with a collagen scaffold bioactivated with free VEGF. This report demonstrates that by finely tuning VEGF release rate within a polymeric scaffold, sprouting of angiogenic vessels can be guided within the scaffolds interstices as well as broadcasted from the host tissues.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Imaging anti-angiogenic treatment response with DCE-VCT, DCE-MRI and DWI in an animal model of breast cancer bone metastasis.", "abstract": "As current classification systems for the assessment of treatment response in bone metastasis do not meet the needs of oncologists, new imaging biomarkers are desirable. Therefore, the diagnostic impact of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-volumetric computed tomography (VCT) (descriptive analysis), DCE-MRI (two-compartment model) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) for monitoring anti-angiogenic therapy effects of the VEGF antibody bevacizumab in breast cancer bone metastases in rats was studied. Nude rats (n=8 animals treated with bevacizumab and n=9 untreated control rats) with site-specific osteolytic bone metastasis of the hind leg were imaged with a 1.5T clinical MRI-scanner in an animal coil as well as in a volumetric CT-scanner at days 30, 40, 50 and 60 after inoculation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. From these data, osteolytic lesion size (OLS), peak enhancement (PE), area under the curve (AUC), amplitude (A), exchange rate constant (k(ep)) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were determined in bone metastases. Prior to changes in OLS (p< or =0.05 at days 50 and 60) there was already a significant decrease in PE, AUC and A (p< or =0.05 at days 40-60) in treated animals compared to controls. However, for k(ep) and ADC there were no significant differences between the groups at any time point (p>0.05 at days 40-60).

All patients were also examined with CT-perfusion (CTp) technique after i.v. injection of 50mL of iodinated contrast. Data were analyzed using a dedicated software which generated a quantitative map of liver parenchyma perfusion. The following parameters were assessed: hepatic perfusion (HP); blood volume (BV); arterial perfusion (AP); time to peak (TTP) and hepatic perfusion index (HPI).

{"title": "Covalent surface heparinization potentiates porous polyurethane scaffold vascularization.", "abstract": "Porous scaffolds play an integral role in many tissue-engineering approaches, and the ability to improve vascularization, without eliciting an excessive inflammatory response, would constitute an important step towards achieving long-term healing and function of devices made from these materials. After having previously optimized the dimensional requirements of the well-defined pores, the present study aimed at a further shift from inflammation to vascularization via surface immobilization with heparin. Porous polyurethane disks were produced to contain well-defined pores (147 +/- 2 microm) with abundant interconnecting windows (67 +/- 2 microm). After heparinization via copolymer grafting and amination to contain 32 microg of heparin, the modification appeared as a uniform layer on all exposed surfaces, with no signs of pore obliteration or significant changes in pore size. After 28 days implantation in a rat subcutaneous model, the scaffolds were assessed for vascularization/arteriolization and inflammation using CD31/actin and ED-1 staining, respectively. Heparinization resulted in a significant increase in vascularization: capillaries increased by 62% in number (66.2 +/- 0.8 to 107.3 +/- 1.4 vessels/mm( 2); p < 0.03) and 56% in total area (0.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.02%; p<0.02). Arteriolization also increased in absolute terms (200% in number; p<0.03), but did not change significantly when normalized to capillary number. Heparinization did not significantly affect the inflammatory response at this time-point, as quantified by ED-1 positive macrophage and foreign body giant cell (FBGC) content. Thus, the in vivo vascularization of porous scaffolds could be increased without concomitant increase in the inflammatory response by employing a simple surface modification technique. This could be a valuable tool for in vivo tissue engineering applications where enhanced vascularization is required.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2008-11-27", "authors": ["DeonBezuidenhout", "NeilDavies", "MelanieBlack", "ChristianSchmidt", "AnelOosthuysen", "PeterZilla"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328208097565"}

A prerequisite for successful application of bioartificial liver tissue is sufficient initial vascularization. In this study, we evaluated the transplantation of fibrin gel-immobilized FLC in a vascularized arterio-veno-venous (AV)-loop model. FLC were isolated from embryonic/foetal (ED 16) rat livers and were enriched by using magnetic cell sorting (MACS). After cryopreservation, FLC were labelled by pkh-26. Cells were transplanted in a fibrin matrix into a subcutaneous chamber containing a microsurgically created AV-loop in the femoral region of the recipient rat. The chambers were explanted after 14 days. Subcutaneous implants without an AV-loop and cell-free implants served as controls. Fluorescence microscopy of the constructs was used to identify pkh-26(+)- donor cells. Characterization was performed by RT-PCR and immunhistology (IH) for CK-18 and CD31. Transplantation of FLC using the AV-loop permitted a neo-tissue formation in the fibrin matrix. A high-density vascularization was observed in the AV-loop constructs as shown by CD31 IH. Viable foetal donor cells were detected which expressed CK-18. FLC can be successfully used for heterotopic transplantation. Fibrin matrix permits rapid blood vessel ingrowth from the AV-loop and supports engraftment of FLC. It is therefore an appropriate environment for hepatocyte transplantation in combination with microsurgical vascularization strategies.
