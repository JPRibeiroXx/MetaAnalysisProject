EPCs were separated and cultured from umbilical cord blood. Their phenotypes were confirmed by uptake of double stains dioctadecyl tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled acetylated LDL and FITC-labeled Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (DILDL-UEA-1). EPCs of cord blood were counted. Human VEGFR-2 and eNOS from the cultured EPCs were assessed by qPCR. Human EPCs was transplanted intramyocardially in canines with AMI. ECG and cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin I) were measured to assess severity of cellular damage. Histopathology was done to assess neovascularisation. Immunostaining was done to detect EPCs transdifferentiation into cardiomyocytes in peri-infarct cardiac tissue. qPCR for human genes (hVEGFR-2, and eNOS) was done to assess homing and angiogenic function of transplanted EPCs. Cultured human cord blood exhibited an increased number of EPCs and significant high expression of hVEGFR-2 and eNOS genes in the culture cells. Histopathology showed increased neovascularization and immunostaining showed presence of EPCs newly differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Our findings suggested that hEPCs can mediate angiogenesis and differentiate into cardiomyoctes in canines with AMI.", "journal": "Journal of advanced research", "date": "2015-03-10", "authors": ["M TAbd El Aziz", "E AAbd El Nabi", "MAbd El Hamid", "DSabry", "H MAtta", "L ARahed", "AShamaa", "SMahfouz", "F MTaha", "SElrefaay", "D MGharib", "Khaled AElsetohy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jare.2013.12.006"}

The hearts were then isolated, and the antioxidant enzymatic activities were assessed. Body weight and catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities significantly decreased in groups fed with OSO, while the lipid peroxidation (LPO) level significantly increased. Administration of OSO with \u03b1T (600 mg \u00b7 kg-1) returned the body weight values and LPO levels to similar values as the control group. The CAT and GPx activities increased but remained significantly lower compared to the control group. In the OSO group with \u03b1T (1200 mg \u00b7 kg-1), the CAT and GPx activities also decreased, while LPO significantly increased. Heart tissue sections obtained from the groups revealed the presence of large areas of necrosis. This study suggested that OSO induced oxidative stress and that administration of a moderate dose of \u03b1T restored the antioxidant balance, but that high levels of \u03b1T supplementation result in a pro-oxidant effect.", "journal": "International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Unfortunately, low retention of these cells, to the therapeutic delivery sites, reduces effectiveness of this strategy; thus it has been identified as the most critical problem for advancement of cardiac regenerative medicine.\nThe specific aim of this work was three-fold: (1) to isolate highly viable populations of human, autologous CD34+, CD117+, and CD133+ bone marrow stem cells; (2) to bioengineer heterospecific, tetravalent antibodies and to use them for recruiting of the stem cells to regenerated zones of infarcted myocardium; (3) to direct vasculogenesis of the retained stem cells with the defined factors.\nCardiac tissue was biopsied from the hearts of the patients, who were receiving orthotopic heart transplants after multiple cardiac infarctions. This tissue was used to engineer fully human \nAdministration of the bioengineered, heterospecific antibodies preceding administration of the stem cells greatly improved the stem cells' recruitment and retention to the infarcted myocardium. Treatment of the retained stem cells with vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin efficiently directed their differentiation into endothelial cells, which expressed vascular endothelial cadherin, platelet / endothelial cell adhesion molecule, claudin, and occludin, while forming tight and adherens junctions.\nThis novel strategy improved retention of the patients' autologous bone marrow stem cells to the infarcted myocardium followed by directed vasculogenesis.

CCl4 (l.2\u00a0ml/kg body weight) was administered as a single dose intraperitoneally. The results revealed that the administration of silymarin alone or in combination with chlorogenic acid (CGA) and/or melatonin for 21 consecutive days, 24\u00a0h after CCl4 injection to rats, markedly ameliorated the increases in serum markers of cardiac infarction, including troponin T and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), as well as increases in the pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in serum and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and C-reactive protein in cardiac tissue compared to CCl4 intoxicated rats. The used agents also successfully modulated the alteration in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum and the oxidative DNA damage and the increase in the apoptosis marker caspase 3 in cardiac tissue in response to CCl4 toxicity. The present biochemical results are supported by histo-pathological examination. The current results proved that treatment with silymarin in combination with CGA and melatonin was the most effective one in ameliorating the toxicity of CCl4 induced cardiac damage and this may support the use of this combination as an effective drug to treat cardiac damage induced by toxic agents.", "journal": "Saudi journal of biological sciences", "date": "2014-06-24", "authors": ["Nouf MAl-Rasheed", "Nawal MAl-Rasheed", "L MFaddah", "Azza MMohamed", "Raeesa AMohammad", "MahaAl-Amin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.09.006"}

Over the last 20 years, cardiomyoplasty, based on the isolated administration of cells with regenerative capacity, has been the focal point of most studies aimed at regenerating the heart. Although this therapy has proved feasible in the clinical setting, the degree of infarcted myocardium regenerated and of improved cardiac function are at best modest. Hence, tissue engineering has emerged as a novel technology using cells with regenerative capacity, biological and/or synthetic materials, growth, proangiogenic and differentiation factors, and online registry systems, to induce the regeneration of whole organs or locally damaged tissue. The next step, seen recently in pioneering animal studies, is de novo generation of bioartificial hearts by decellularization and preservation of supporting structures for their subsequent repopulation with new contractile, vascular muscle tissue.

{"title": "Is the lack of adiponectin associated with increased ER/SR stress and inflammation in the heart?", "abstract": "Objective To study whether there is an association between adiponectin and endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ERSR) stress. Research design Eleven-month-old male wild-type (WT) and adiponectin knockout (ADKO) mice were placed on chow or high fat diet for 12 weeks. The changes in ER stress and inflammatory genes were determined in the epididymal adipose, as well as heart tissue of adult WT and ADKO mice. To understand the role of ER/SR stress in the regulation of adiponectin, we studied the effect of tunicamycin or palmitate on H9C2 cardiomyoblasts in culture. To demonstrate the protective role of adiponectin, we studied the effect of purified adiponectin on the regulation of ERSR stress genes and inflammation in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Results (1) High fat diet increased TNF\u03b1 in adipose tissue of ADKO mice. (2) ERSR stress genes, HSPa5, ERN1, and GADD34, and inflammation response genes, TNF\u03b1 and CD68, were increased in heart of ADKO mice. High fat diet did not further increase the effect. (3) Induction of ERSR stress by tunicamycin in H9C2 resulted in the upregulation of ERSR stress response genes along with downregulation of adiponectin, adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, and Serca2A. ER stress was accompanied by down regulation of I\u043a\u03b2\u03b1 and an increase in HSPa5 proteins. (4) Adiponectin decreased ERSR stress and inflammation response genes and increased Serca2A in to H9C2 cardiomyoblasts.

Progress in treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality will include the development of new drugs. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell technology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication techniques have created a unique opportunity to develop three-dimensional (3D) microphysiological systems that more accurately reflect in vivo human biology when compared with two-dimensional flat systems or animal models. Our group is working to develop 3D microphysiological systems using induced pluripotent stem cell technology that simulates the microcirculation, the cardiac muscle, and the solid tumor, and then to combine these systems into an integrated microphysiological system that simulates perfused cardiac muscle and solid tumor on a single platform. The platform will be initially validated to predict anti-cancer efficacy while minimizing cardiac muscle toxicity. A critical feature will be blood flow through a human microcirculation (capillaries and larger microvessels), which is necessary to overcome diffusion limitations of nutrients and waste products in realistic 3D cultures, and serves to integrate multiple organ systems. This is a necessary and critical feature of any platform that seeks to simulate integrated human organ systems.

The activity of catalase superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and intensity of lipid peroxidation was determined in the tissues of the heart, kidneys and liver. Doxorubicin in the content of nanocarrier alone caused an increase of serum creatinine and aspartateaminotrasferase activity in plasma of experimental animals with carcinoma. Nanocomposite which contained doxorubicin and NSE, did not cause an increase of these parameters. It has been shown that the administration of a carrier containing doxorubicin to mice with Lewis lung carcinoma caused the decrease of catalase activity in mice with carcinoma. The combination of NSE and doxorubicin on the carrier led to the normalization of this parameter to the level of intact animals. NSE immobilized on a carrier together with doxorubicin caused a decrease in the activity of superoxide dismutase in the kidney tissue of mice with tumor.

Despite its demonstrated cardioprotective activity, the bioaccumulation of RSV or its metabolites in cardiac tissue is still unknown.\nDiabetic rats were randomized to 1, 3 or 6 weeks of RSV treatment at two different doses (1 or 5\u00a0mg/kg/day). A dose and time-dependent accumulation was observed, with no detectable levels of RSV metabolites found in heart tissues after 1 week and significant concentrations of RSV-3-sulfate and RSV-3-glucuronide after 6 weeks of treatment (0.05\u00a0nmol/g of tissue and 0.01\u00a0nmol/g of tissue, respectively). Tissue accumulation of RSV metabolites was accompanied by an improvement of cardiac function in long-term diabetes, when myocardial morpho-functional damage is more evident, with an almost complete recovery of all hemodynamic parameters, at the highest RSV dose.\nEven if a higher concentration of RSV in tissues cannot be ruled out after constant oral administration, an accumulation coherent with what is usually evaluated in cell based mechanistic studies is largely unattainable and the RSV unconjugated form would not be present in this paradigm.

The thoracic inferior vena cava instead of pulmonary artery was employed to reconstruct the outflow tract of the graft heart (in the new method group, 82 cases). Meanwhile, in other 47 cases as the control group, traditional anastomosis was used between pulmonary artery of the graft and vena cava of the recipient. The recipient surgery time, vena cava-vena cava anastomosis time, graft cold ischemia time and graft re-beating time were (41.5 +/- 1. 5) min, (8.4 +/- 0.6) min, (32.3 +/- 0.4) min and (1.5 +/- 0.2) min respectively. All the above data were statistically superior to those in the traditional method group (P < 0.001 or P < 0.05). The survival rate of 100 d post surgery in the new method group was 93. 9%. Meanwhile, the cardiac tissue remained almost normal examined by HE and Picro-sirus red staining. Therefore, the novel model can facilitate the anastomosis of the outflow tract in recipient operation in mouse heart transplantation model.", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "date": "2014-01-28", "authors": ["SongSu"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Antenatal architecture and activity of the human heart.", "abstract": "We construct the components for a family of computational models of the electrophysiology of the human foetal heart from 60 days gestational age (DGA) to full term. This requires both cell excitation models that reconstruct the myocyte action potentials, and datasets of cardiac geometry and architecture. Fast low-angle shot and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) of foetal hearts provides cardiac geometry with voxel resolution of approximately 100 \u00b5m. DT-MRI measures the relative diffusion of protons and provides a measure of the average intravoxel myocyte orientation, and the orientation of any higher order orthotropic organization of the tissue. Such orthotropic organization in the adult mammalian heart has been identified with myocardial sheets and cleavage planes between them. During gestation, the architecture of the human ventricular wall changes from being irregular and isotropic at 100 DGA to an anisotropic and orthotropic architecture by 140 DGA, when it has the smooth, approximately 120\u00b0 transmural change in myocyte orientation that is characteristic of the adult mammalian ventricle. The DT obtained from DT-MRI provides the conductivity tensor that determines the spread of potential within computational models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology. The foetal electrocardiogram (fECG) can be recorded from approximately 60 DGA, and RR, PR and QT intervals between the P, R, Q and T waves of the fECG can be extracted by averaging from approximately 90 DGA. The RR intervals provide a measure of the pacemaker rate, the QT intervals an index of ventricular action potential duration, and its rate-dependence, and so these intervals constrain and inform models of cell electrophysiology. The parameters of models of adult human sinostrial node and ventricular cells that are based on adult cell electrophysiology and tissue molecular mapping have been modified to construct preliminary models of foetal cell electrophysiology, which reproduce these intervals from fECG recordings. The PR and QR intervals provide an index of conduction times, and hence propagation velocities (approx. 1-10 cm s(-1), increasing during gestation) and so inform models of tissue electrophysiology.

{"title": "Anaphylactic Shock: Kounis Hypersensitivity-Associated Syndrome Seems to be the Primary Cause.", "abstract": "Experiments have shown that anaphylaxis decreases cardiac output; increases left ventricular end diastolic pressure; induces severe early acute increase in respiratory resistance with pulmonary interstitial edema; and decreases splanchnic, cerebral, and myocardial blood flow more than what would be expected from severe arterial dilation and hypotension. This is attributed to the constrictive action of inflammatory mediators released during anaphylactic shock. Inflammatory mediators such as histamine, neutral proteases, arachidonic acid products, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and a variety of cytokines and chemokines constitute the pathophysiologic basis of Kounis hypersensitivity-associated acute coronary syndrome. Although the mechanisms of anaphylactic shock still remain to be elucidated, myocardial involvement due to vasospasm-induced coronary blood flow reduction manifesting as Kounis syndrome should be always considered. Searching current experimental and clinical literature on anaphylactic shock pathophysiology, causality, clinical appearance, and treatment via PubMed showed that differentiating global hypoperfusion from primary tissue suppression due to mast cell mediator constrictive action on systemic arterial vasculature is a challenging procedure. Combined tissue suppression from arterial involvement and peripheral vasodilatation, perhaps, occur simultaneously.

The presence of high loads of venous gas emboli (VGE) induced by a rapid ambient pressure reduction on ascent from diving may cause ischemia and acute heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diving-induced VGE formation on cardiac stress marker levels and the cardioprotective effect of HBO-PC. To induce high loads of VGE, 63 female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a rapid ambient pressure reduction from a simulated saturation dive (50 min at 709 kPa) in a pressure chamber. VGE loads were measured for 60 min in anesthetized animals by the use of ultrasonography. The animals were divided into five groups. Three groups were exposed to either diving or to HBO-PC (100% oxygen, 38 min at 303 kPa) with a 45 or 180 min interval between HBO-PC and diving. Two additional groups were used as baseline controls for the measurements; one group was exposed to equal handling except for HBO-PC and diving, and the other group was completely unexposed. Diving caused high loads of VGE, as well as elevated levels of the cardiac stress markers, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), natriuretic peptide precursor B (Nppb), and \u03b1B-crystallin, in blood and cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Formation of spatially discordant alternans due to fluctuations and diffusion of calcium.", "abstract": "Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) of action potential duration (APD) is a phenomenon where different regions of cardiac tissue exhibit an alternating sequence of APD that are out-of-phase. SDA is arrhythmogenic since it can induce spatial heterogeneity of refractoriness, which can cause wavebreak and reentry. However, the underlying mechanisms for the formation of SDA are not completely understood. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism for the formation of SDA in the case where the cellular instability leading to alternans is caused by intracellular calcium (Ca) cycling, and where Ca transient and APD alternans are electromechanically concordant. In particular, we show that SDA is formed when rapidly paced cardiac tissue develops alternans over many beats due to Ca accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The mechanism presented here relies on the observation that Ca cycling fluctuations dictate Ca alternans phase since the amplitude of Ca alternans is small during the early stages of pacing. Thus, different regions of a cardiac myocyte will typically develop Ca alternans which are opposite in phase at the early stages of pacing. These subcellular patterns then gradually coarsen due to interactions with membrane voltage to form steady state SDA of voltage and Ca on the tissue scale. This mechanism for SDA is distinct from well-known mechanisms that rely on conduction velocity restitution, and a Turing-like mechanism known to apply only in the case where APD and Ca alternans are electromechanically discordant. Furthermore, we argue that this mechanism is robust, and is likely to underlie a wide range of experimentally observed patterns of SDA.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-01-07", "authors": ["DaisukeSato", "Donald MBers", "YohannesShiferaw"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0085365\n10.1080/713609356\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00737-X\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.10.1385\n10.1161/hc4201.097136\n10.1056/NEJM199401273300402\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2008.02.014\n10.1103/PhysRevE.71.021903\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77126-2\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00196.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.14.1664\n10.1103/PhysRevE.76.051911\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.208101\n10.1161/01.RES.0000240542.03986.e7\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.108103\n10.1196/annals.1380.020\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.00088.x\n10.1007/978-94-007-2888-2_52\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.09.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.10.012\n10.1161/01.RES.0000244002.88813.91\n10.1152/ajpheart.00757.2007\n10.1073/pnas.0511061103\n10.1152/ajpheart.01121.2010\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74784-5\n10.1161/01.res.0000244087.36230.bf\n10.1109/10.784149\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.1.201\n10.1529/biophysj.106.98160\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197590\n10.1529/biophysj.106.091009\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.10.3761\n10.1529/biophysj.108.130419\n10.1161/01.RES.0000119923.64774.72\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.221481\n10.1536/ihj.47.381\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00011-5\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)00033-8\n10.1073/pnas.0602133103\n10.1113/expphysiol.2009.047548"}
{"title": "Shock-induced termination of reentrant cardiac arrhythmias: comparing monophasic and biphasic shock protocols.", "abstract": "In this article, we compare quantitatively the efficiency of three different protocols commonly used in commercial defibrillators. These are based on monophasic and both symmetric and asymmetric biphasic shocks. A numerical one-dimensional model of cardiac tissue using the bidomain formulation is used in order to test the different protocols. In particular, we performed a total of 4.8 \u00d7 10(6) simulations by varying shock waveform, shock energy, initial conditions, and heterogeneity in internal electrical conductivity.

This study investigated whether stimulation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor is able to ameliorate post-MI cardiac remodeling and what the underlying mechanisms may be. MI was induced in Wistar rats by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery. Treatment with the angiotensin type 2 receptor agonist compound 21 (0.03 mg/kg) was started 6 hours post-MI and continued for 6 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by echocardiography and intracardiac catheter. Effects on proteolysis were studied in heart tissue and primary cardiac fibroblasts. Compound 21 significantly improved systolic and diastolic functions, resulting in improved ejection fraction (71.2\u00b14.7% versus 53.4\u00b17.0%; P<0.001), fractional shortening (P<0.05), LV internal dimension in systole (P<0.05), LV end-diastolic pressure (16.9\u00b11.2 versus 22.1\u00b11.4 mm Hg; P<0.05), ratio of early (E) to late (A) ventricular filling velocities, and maximum and minimum rate of LV pressure rise (P<0.05). Compound 21 improved arterial stiffness parameters and reduced collagen content in peri-infarct myocardium. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 was strongly upregulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and transforming growth factor \u03b21 were diminished in LV of treated animals.

In this study, various 5-HT agonists and antagonists were employed to determine which 5-HT receptor subtypes are responsible for the positive chronotropic effect by 5-HT. The pharmacological results demonstrate that a 5-HT2B agonist significantly increases the heart rate; however, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT7 agonists do not have a significant effect on the heart rate. Furthermore, 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, markedly reduces the positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT in a dose-response manner. Furthermore, we employed genetic approaches to confirm the pharmacological results. For this purpose, we used RNA interference line to knock down 5-HT2ADro and also used 5-HT2ADro and 5-HT2BDro insertional mutation lines. The results show that 5-HT2ADro or 5-HT2BDro receptor mutations reduce the response of the heart to 5-HT.

Amiodarone reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, but oral therapy requires a presurgery loading period, lasting from 1 to 4 weeks. In this study, we showed that it is possible to rapidly obtain therapeutic cardiac tissue levels of the drug by infusing aqueous amiodarone intrapericardially, without appreciable systemic exposure. We also examined the long-term histologic safety of intrapericardial infusion.\nIn this observational study, 9 adult sheep, randomized into 3 groups of 3 animals each, were given low (2.5 -mg/h), medium (10-mg/h), or high (50-mg/h) dosages of amiodarone by continuous infusion intrapericardially for 72 hours. An intrapericardial drain prevented tamponade from fluid build-up. Levels of amiodarone and its active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA), were assessed both in plasma and in transmural biopsy specimens taken from the left atrial appendage and left and right ventricular myocardium. Cardiac, hepatic, and renal functions were also assessed. Humane euthanization was performed after 3 months, and cardiac and thoracic tissues were assessed for evidence of epicarditis, severe fibrotic changes, or other adverse effects potentially caused by the local amiodarone administration.\nPericardial infusion resulted in rapid uptake and high concentrations of amiodarone and DEA in the myocardial tissues, without an appreciable systemic presence of either drug. The highest and lowest levels of these agents were observed in the left atrium and left ventricle, respectively. Drug concentrations in all cardiac biopsy specimens were similar to, or higher than, those reportedly observed in patients taking long-term oral amiodarone. At 90 days, postmortem microscopic, biochemical, and hematologic evaluation of end-organ tissues from the 8 surviving sheep showed no adverse effects. Excessive inflammation or fibrotic changes were not observed in these 8 sheep. The ninth sheep died prematurely, and its death was deemed not to be related to this study.\nShort-term intrapericardial delivery of amiodarone is a safe method for rapidly obtaining therapeutic atrial-tissue drug levels.

{"title": "Co-treatment with conjugated linoleic acid and nitrite protects against myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "According to the CDC, the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which commonly leads to myocardial infarction (MI). Therapeutic approaches to lessen the resulting cardiovascular injury associated with MI are limited. Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to act as negative regulators of gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and/or stimulating mRNA degradation. A single miRNA can modulate physiological or disease phenotypes by regulating whole functional systems. Importantly, miRNAs can regulate cardiac function, thereby modulating heart muscle contraction, heart growth and morphogenesis. MicroRNA-499 (miRNA-499) is a cardiac-specific miRNA that when elevated causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in turn preventing cardiac dysfunction during MI. Previous studies revealed that combination treatment with conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) and nitrite preserved cardiovascular function in mice. Therefore, it was hypothesized that cLA and nitrite may regulate miRNA-499, thus providing cardiac protection during MI. To test this hypothesis, 12-week old mice were treated with cLA (10\u00a0mg/kg/d-via osmotic mini-pump) or cLA and nitrite (50\u00a0ppm-drinking water) 3 days prior to MI (ligation of the left anterior descending artery). Echocardiography and pressure-volume (PV)-loop analysis revealed that cLA and nitrite-treated MI mice had improved heart function (10 days following MI) compared to untreated MI mice. Treatment with cLA and nitrite significantly induced levels of miRNA-499 compared to untreated MI mice. In addition, treatment with cLA and nitrite abolished MI-induced protein expression of p53 and dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP-1). Moreover, the antioxidant enzyme expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was elevated in MI mice treated with cLA and nitrite compared to untreated MI mice. Confocal imaging on heart tissue confirmed expression the levels of HO-1 and p53.

Transcriptional profiling showed that 51, 46 and 26 of 88 genes were significantly upregulated after 2 Gy, 10 Gy and FIR. Of these genes, 22 showed dose- and fractionation-independent upregulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed a robust increase in p65 and cMyc expression in distant heart after SDR and FIR. Immunoblotting revealed increased phosphorylation of p38 after 2 Gy and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 after 10 Gy in nontargeted heart. In addition, IR exposure significantly enhanced DNA fragmentation in nontargeted heart. Together, these data clearly indicated an induced abscopal response in distant organ after clinically relevant IR doses. More importantly, the results imply that orchestration of NF-\u03baB signal transduction in nontargeted tissues may serve as an effector and could play a key role in induced abscopal responses.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2013-12-21", "authors": ["SAravindan", "MNatarajan", "S KRamraj", "VPandian", "F HKhan", "T SHerman", "NAravindan"], "doi": "10.1038/cgt.2013.72"}

In this study we tested the hypothesis that POI in women under hormone therapy (HT) are associated with vascular vasodilatation attenuation and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and these impairments are related to changes in systemic antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the possibility that ovarian hormone deprivation can induce such changes and that HT cannot reverse all of those impairments was examined in an experimental model of POI.\nFifteen control and 17 patients with primary ovarian insufficiency receiving HT were included in the study. To test the systemic and cardiac consequences of ovarian hormone deprivation, ovariectomy was induced in young female rats that were submitted or not to HT. Spectral analysis of RR interval and blood pressure signals were performed and oxidative stress parameters were determined.\nPOI women under HT have increased mean arterial pressure (94\u00b110 vs. 86\u00b15 mmHg) despite normal endothelial and autonomic modulation of vasculature. Additionally, they presented impaired baroreflex sensitivity (3.9\u00b11.38 vs. 7.15\u00b13.62 ms/mmHg) and reduced heart rate variability (2310\u00b11173 vs. 3754\u00b11921 ms(2)). Similar results obtained in ovariectomized female rats were accompanied by an increased lipoperoxidation (7433\u00b11010 vs. 6180\u00b1289 cps/mg protein) and decreased antioxidant enzymes in cardiac tissue. As it was observed in women, the HT in animals did not restore hemodynamic and autonomic dysfunctions.\nThese data provide clinical and experimental evidence that long term HT may not restore all cardiovascular risk factors associated with ovarian hormone deprivation.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["SilviaGoldmeier", "K\u00e1tiaDe Angelis", "KarinaRabello Casali", "C\u00e9sarVilodre", "FernandaConsolim-Colombo", "AdrianeBell\u00f3 Klein", "RodrigoPlentz", "PolimaraSpritzer", "Maria-Cl\u00e1udiaIrigoyen"], "doi": null}
{"title": "The uremic toxin adsorbent AST-120 abrogates cardiorenal injury following myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "An accelerated progressive decline in renal function is a frequent accompaniment of myocardial infarction (MI). Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin that accumulates from the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is contributory to both renal and cardiac fibrosis. IS levels can be reduced by administration of the oral adsorbent AST-120, which has been shown to ameliorate pathological renal and cardiac fibrosis in moderate to severe CKD. However, the cardiorenal effect of AST-120 on less severe renal dysfunction in the post-MI setting has not previously been well studied. MI-induced Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either AST-120 (MI+AST-120) or were untreated (MI+Vehicle) for 16 weeks. Serum IS levels were measured at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. Echocardiography and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were assessed prior to sacrifice. Renal and cardiac tissues were assessed for pathological changes using histological and immunohistochemical methods, Western blot analysis and real-time PCR. Compared with sham, MI+Vehicle animals had a significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (by 42%, p<0.001) and fractional shortening (by 52%, p<0.001) as well as lower GFR (p<0.05) and increased serum IS levels (p<0.05). A significant increase in interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex was demonstrated in MI+Vehicle animals (p<0.001). Compared with MI+Vehicle, MI+AST-120 animals had increased GFR (by 13.35%, p<0.05) and reduced serum IS (p<0.001), renal interstitial fibrosis (p<0.05), and renal KIM-1, collagen-IV and TIMP-1 expression (p<0.05). Cardiac function did not change with AST-120 treatment, however gene expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as collagen-I and TIMP-1 protein expression was decreased in the non-infarcted myocardium (p<0.05).

Recent reports have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by MSCs have angiogenesis-promoting activity; however, the therapeutic effect of MSC-EVs on an ischemic heart is unclear. In the present study, we reported that MSCs could release a large quantity of EVs around 100\u00a0nm in diameter upon hypoxia stimulation though the majority of the cells had not experienced apoptosis. MSC-EVs could be promptly uptaken by human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and the internalization resulted in dose-dependent enhancement of in vitro proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells. Using an acute myocardial infarction rat model, we found that intramyocardial injection of MSC-EVs markedly enhanced blood flow recovery, in accordance with reduced infarct size and preserved cardiac systolic and diastolic performance compared to those treated with PBS. These data suggest that like MSCs, MSC-EVs could also protect cardiac tissue from ischemic injury at least by means of promoting blood vessel formation, though further detailed investigations should be performed to define the functionality of MSC-EVs.\nMSCs released extracellular vesicles (EVs) upon hypoxia stimulation.

Parasympathetic cardiac ganglion (CG) neurons synthesize and release the sympathetic neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), which may serve to maintain these close connections. In this study we investigated whether NGF synthesis by CG neurons is altered in heart failure, and whether norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons promotes NGF synthesis. NGF and proNGF immunoreactivity in CG neurons in heart failure rats following chronic coronary artery ligation was investigated. NGF immunoreactivity was decreased significantly in heart failure rats compared to sham-operated animals, whereas proNGF expression was unchanged. Changes in neurochemistry of CG neurons included attenuated expression of the cholinergic marker vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and increased expression of the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. To further investigate norepinephrine's role in promoting NGF synthesis, we cultured CG neurons treated with adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists. An 82% increase in NGF mRNA levels was detected after 1h of isoproterenol (\u03b2-AR agonist) treatment, which increased an additional 22% at 24h. Antagonist treatment blocked isoproterenol-induced increases in NGF transcripts. In contrast, the \u03b1-AR agonist phenylephrine did not alter NGF mRNA expression.

The peak systolic tissue velocity (PSV), peak systolic displacement (PD), and peak systolic strain (PS) were determined in the mid-segment of the ventricular walls (ROI 1 right ventricle (RV), ROI 2 left ventricle (LV)) and in the basal segment of the ventricular walls (ROI 3 tricuspid annulus, ROI 4 mitral annulus). TDI parameters were correlated with established fetal vascular Doppler parameters (peak systolic blood flow velocity (Vmax) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), pulsatility index (PI) in the MCA, in the umbilical artery (UA), and in the venous duct (DV)).\nThe PSV in the LV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the MCA. Both the PSV and PD in the LV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the UA. The PS in the RV correlated significantly negatively with the PI in the UA. The left ventricular PSV and PD correlated significantly positively with the PI in the DV. The Vmax in the MCA did not correlate with any systolic myocardial TDI parameter.\nIn fetal anemia, peak systolic myocardial TDI parameters correlate with vascular Doppler parameters, confirming that TDI is a promising method to evaluate myocardial function in the anemic fetus.

{"title": "MYBPC3's alternate ending: consequences and therapeutic implications of a highly prevalent 25 bp deletion mutation.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common form of inherited cardiac disease and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. HCM is caused by mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a thick filament contractile protein that regulates sarcomere organization and cardiac contractility. About 200 different mutations in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) have thus far been reported as causing HCM. Among them, a 25 base pair deletion in the branch point of intron 32 of MYBPC3 is widespread, particularly affecting people of South Asian descent, with 4% of this population carrying the mutation. This polymorphic mutation results in skipping of exon 33 and a reading frame shift, which, in turn, replaces the last 65 amino acids of the C-terminal C10 domain of cMyBP-C with a novel sequence of 58 residues (cMyBP-C(C10mut)). Carriers of the 25 base pair deletion mutation are at increased risk of developing cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Because of the high prevalence of this mutation in certain populations, genetic screening of at-risk groups might be beneficial. Scientifically, the functional consequences of C-terminal mutations and the precise mechanisms leading to HCM should be defined using induced pluripotent stem cells and engineered heart tissue in vitro or mouse models in vivo. Most importantly, therapeutic strategies that include pharmacology, gene repair, and gene therapy should be developed to prevent the adverse clinical effects of cMyBP-C(C10mut). This review article aims to examine the effects of cMyBP-C(C10mut) on cardiac function, emphasizing the need for the development of genetic testing and expanded therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2013-12-12", "authors": ["Diederik W DKuster", "SakthivelSadayappan"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-013-1417-7"}

One possible mechanism is through mobilization of endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs). This study aimed to test the pro-migratory effect of MSC conditioned medium (MSC-CM) on endogenous CSCs from human cardiac tissue. By using a three-dimensional collagen assay, we found that MSC-CM improved migration of cells from human cardiac tissue. Cell counts, perimeter and area measurements were utilized to quantify migration effects. To examine whether resident stem cells were among the migrating cells, specific stem cell properties were investigated. The migrating cells displayed strong similarities with resident Cardiac Atrial appendage Stem Cells (CASCs), including a clonogenic potential of ~21.5% and expression of pluripotency associated genes like Oct-4, Nanog, c-Myc and Klf-4. Similar to CASCs, migrating cells demonstrated high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and were able to differentiate towards cardiomyocytes. Receptor tyrosine kinase analysis and collagen assays performed with recombinant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and Imatinib Mesylate, a PDGF receptor inhibitor, suggested a role for the PDGF-AA/PDGF receptor \u03b1 axis in enhancing the migration process of CASCs. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that factors present in MSC-CM improve migration of resident stem cells from human cardiac tissue. These data open doors towards future therapies in which MSC secreted factors, like PDGF-AA, can be utilized to enhance the recruitment of CASCs towards the site of myocardial injury.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2013-12-12", "authors": ["SeverinaWindmolders", "AstridDe Boeck", "RemcoKoninckx", "AnnickDani\u00ebls", "OlivierDe Wever", "MarcBracke", "MarcHendrikx", "KarenHensen", "Jean-LucRummens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.016"}

However, the regulation of heart rate during embryonic development is still not clear. The aim of this study was to determine how endothelin-1 (ET-1) affects the heart rate of embryonic mice, as well as the pathway through which it exerts its effects.\nThe effects of ET-1 and ET-1 receptor inhibition on cardiac contraction were studied using confocal Ca(2+) imaging of isolated mouse embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes and ultrasonographic examination of embryonic cardiac contractions in utero. In addition, the amount of ET-1 peptide and ET receptor a (ETa) and b (ETb) mRNA levels were measured during different stages of development of the cardiac muscle.\nHigh ET-1 concentration and expression of both ETa and ETb receptors was observed in early cardiac tissue. ET-1 was found to increase the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in E10.5 embryonic cardiomyocytes in vitro. Non-specific inhibition of ET receptors with tezosentan caused arrhythmia and bradycardia in isolated embryonic cardiomyocytes and in whole embryonic hearts both in vitro (E10.5) and in utero (E12.5). ET-1-mediated stimulation of early heart rate was found to occur via ETb receptors and subsequent inositol trisphosphate receptor activation and increased SR Ca(2+) leak.\nEndothelin-1 is required to maintain a sufficient heart rate, as well as to prevent arrhythmia during early development of the mouse heart.

The expression levels of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE), transforming growth factor- \u03b2 1 (TGF- \u03b2 1), collagen IV, fibronectin, urotensin II, and urotensin II receptor were examined in the myocardial tissue of ZDF rats. KIOM-79 treatment at 500\u2009mg/kg inhibited the accumulation of AGEs, reduced RAGE mRNA and protein expression, and reduced the upregulation of cardiac fibrogenic factors, such as fibronectin and collagen IV, in heart of ZDF rats. Additionally, KIOM-79 ameliorated urotensin II/receptor gene expression in the cardiac tissue of ZDF rats. Our findings indicate that KIOM-79 diminishes cardiac fibrosis in ZDF rats by preventing AGEs accumulation and RAGE overexpression and by modulating the cardiac urotensin II/receptor pathway, which decreases the amount of profibrotic factors, such as TGF- \u03b2 1, fibronectin, and collagen in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2013-12-11", "authors": ["JunghyunKim", "EunjinSohn", "Chan-SikKim", "Yun MiLee", "KyuhyungJo", "Jin SookKim"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/547653"}

Myocardial mass loss and lack of contractility are precursors to heart failure. Surgical demand for effective myocardial repair is tempered by a paucity of appropriate biological materials. These materials should conveniently replicate natural human tissue components, convey persistent elasticity, promote cell attachment, growth and conformability to direct cell orientation and functional performance. Here, microfabrication techniques are applied to recombinant human tropoelastin, the resilience-imparting protein found in all elastic human tissues, to generate photocrosslinked biological materials containing well-defined micropatterns. These highly elastic substrates are then used to engineer biomimetic cardiac tissue constructs. The micropatterned hydrogels, produced through photocrosslinking of methacrylated tropoelastin (MeTro), promote the attachment, spreading, alignment, function, and intercellular communication of cardiomyocytes by providing an elastic mechanical support that mimics their dynamic mechanical properties in vivo. The fabricated MeTro hydrogels also support the synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes in response to electrical field stimulation.

We evaluated the efficacy of curcumin pretreatment on cardioprotection.\nThirty Sprague-Dawley rats were evenly divided into 3 groups of sham-operated control, renal I/R injury, and a curcumin pretreatment group. Renal ischemia was conducted by bilateral occlusions of pedicles for 45 minutes, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. The cardiac function was assessed by the left ventricular end-systolic-pressure-volume-relation (ESPVR), systolic pressure (SP), ejection fraction (EF), and stroke volume (SV).

In this study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enabled by matrix implantation of ionized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was used to map several classes of lipids in heart tissue. The use of AgNP matrix implantation was motivated by our previous work showing that implantation doses of only 10(14)/cm(2) of 2 nm gold nanoparticulates into the first 10 nm of the near surface of the tissue enabled detection of most brain lipids (including neutral lipid species such as cerebrosides) more efficiently than traditional organic MALDI matrices. Herein, a similar implantation of 500 eV AgNP(-) across the entire heart tissue section results in a quick, reproducible, solvent-free, uniform matrix concentration of 6 nm AgNP residing near the tissue surface.

Hence the present study was framed to investigate the protective role of Gallic acid (GA) on AGEs induced cardiac fibrosis. Rats were infused with in vitro prepared AGEs (50mg/kg BW-intravenous injection) for 30 days. Further, GA (25mg/kgBW) was administered to rats along with AGEs. On infusion of AGEs, induction of fibrotic markers, collagen deposition, oxidative marker NADPH oxidase (NOX-p47 phox subunit), AGE receptor (RAGE) and cytokines expression was evaluated in the heart tissues using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining methods. AGEs infusion significantly (P<0.01) increased the HW/BW ratio and fibrosis (4-fold) with increased expression of matrix genes MMP-2 and -9 (P<0.01, respectively) in the heart tissues.

Further, GA treatment effectively prevented the AGEs mediated up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes and ECM proteins such as TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, MMP-2 and -9 expression. In addition, the increased expression of NOX (P<0.01), RAGE (P<0.01), NF-\u03baB (P<0.01) and ERK 1/2 on AGEs infusion were normalized by GA treatment.

ECTs rapidly mature in vitro to acquire the features of functional cardiac muscle and respond to mechanical load with increased proliferation and maturation. ECTs are now being investigated as platforms for in vitro models for human diseases and for pharmacologic screening for drug toxicities. We tested the hypothesis that global ECT gene expression patterns are complex and sensitive to mechanical loading and tyrosine kinase inhibitors similar to the maturing myocardium. We generated ECTs from day 14.5 rat embryo ventricular cells, as previously published, and then conditioned constructs after 5 days in culture for 48 h with mechanical stretch (5%, 0.5 Hz) and/or the p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor BIRB796. RNA was isolated from individual ECTs and assayed using a standard Agilent rat 4 \u00d7 44k V3 microarray and Pathway Analysis software for transcript expression fold changes and changes in regulatory molecules and networks. Changes in expression were confirmed by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) for selected regulatory molecules. At the threshold of a 1.5-fold change in expression, stretch altered 1559 transcripts, versus 1411 for BIRB796, and 1846 for stretch plus BIRB796. As anticipated, top pathways altered in response to these stimuli include cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation; tissue development; cell death, cell signaling, and small molecule biochemistry as well as numerous other pathways. Thus, ECTs display a broad spectrum of altered gene expression in response to mechanical load and/or tyrosine kinase inhibition, reflecting a complex regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and architectural alignment of cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes within ECT.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2013-12-05", "authors": ["FeiYe", "FangpingYuan", "XiaohongLi", "NigelCooper", "Joseph PTinney", "Bradley BKeller"], "doi": "10.1002/phy2.78"}
{"title": "Hypoxia-induced epigenetic modifications are associated with cardiac tissue fibrosis and the development of a myofibroblast-like phenotype.", "abstract": "Ischemia caused by coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction leads to aberrant ventricular remodeling and cardiac fibrosis. This occurs partly through accumulation of gene expression changes in resident fibroblasts, resulting in an overactive fibrotic phenotype. Long-term adaptation to a hypoxic insult is likely to require significant modification of chromatin structure in order to maintain the fibrotic phenotype. Epigenetic changes may play an important role in modulating hypoxia-induced fibrosis within the heart. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the potential pro-fibrotic impact of hypoxia on cardiac fibroblasts and determine whether alterations in DNA methylation could play a role in this process. This study found that within human cardiac tissue, the degree of hypoxia was associated with increased expression of collagen 1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA). In addition, human cardiac fibroblast cells exposed to prolonged 1% hypoxia resulted in a pro-fibrotic state. These hypoxia-induced pro-fibrotic changes were associated with global DNA hypermethylation and increased expression of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Expression of these methylating enzymes was shown to be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1. Using siRNA to block DNMT3B expression significantly reduced collagen 1 and ASMA expression. In addition, application of the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine suppressed the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF\u03b2. Epigenetic modifications and changes in the epigenetic machinery identified in cardiac fibroblasts during prolonged hypoxia may contribute to the pro-fibrotic nature of the ischemic milieu.

We sought to investigate the role of interleukin-23 (IL-23) deficiency, a cytokine important in differentiation of CD4+ cells, in scar formation of the ischemic heart.\nMI was performed in wild-type and IL23p19-/- mice. Thirty-day mortality, hemodynamic function 4 days after MI and myocardial inflammation, and remodeling 4 and 30 days after MI were examined. Differentiation of fibroblasts from infarcted and noninfarcted hearts into myofibroblasts was examined under basal conditions and after stimulation with interferon-\u03b3, IL-17\u03b1 and IL-23. Interleukin-23p19-/- mice showed higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration in the scar early after MI compared with wild-type mice. A stronger interferon-\u03b3/Th1 reaction seemed to be responsible for the increased inflammation under IL-23 deficiency. Expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen I and III was significantly higher in the heart tissue and isolated cardiac fibroblasts 4 days after MI in the wild-type mice. Interleukin-23p19-/- mice showed impaired healing compared with wild-type mice, as seen by significantly higher mortality because of ventricular rupture (40% higher after 30 days) and stronger left ventricular dilation early after MI. Stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts with interferon-\u03b3, the main Th1 cytokine, but not with IL-23 or IL-17\u03b1, led to a significant downregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and III and decreased migration and differentiation to myofibroblasts.\nIL-23 deficiency leads to increased myocardial inflammation and decreased cardiac fibroblast activation, associated with impaired scar formation and adverse remodeling after MI.", "journal": "Circulation.

{"title": "Glutathione peroxidase-1 deficiency potentiates dysregulatory modifications of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and vascular dysfunction in aging.", "abstract": "Recently, we demonstrated that gene ablation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 markedly contributed to age-related vascular dysfunction and mitochondrial oxidative stress. The present study has sought to investigate the extent of vascular dysfunction and oxidant formation in glutathione peroxidase-1-deficient (GPx-1(-/-)) mice during the aging process with special emphasis on dysregulation (uncoupling) of the endothelial NO synthase. GPx-1(-/-) mice on a C57 black 6 (C57BL/6) background at 2, 6, and 12 months of age were used. Vascular function was significantly impaired in 12-month-old GPx-1(-/-) -mice as compared with age-matched controls. Oxidant formation, detected by 3-nitrotyrosine staining and dihydroethidine-based fluorescence microtopography, was increased in the aged GPx-1(-/-) mice. Aging per se caused a substantial protein kinase C- and protein tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation as well as S-glutathionylation of endothelial NO synthase associated with uncoupling, a phenomenon that was more pronounced in aged GPx-1(-/-) mice. GPx-1 ablation increased adhesion of leukocytes to cultured endothelial cells and CD68 and F4/80 staining in cardiac tissue. Aged GPx-1(-/-) mice displayed increased oxidant formation as compared with their wild-type littermates, triggering redox-signaling pathways associated with endothelial NO synthase dysfunction and uncoupling. Thus, our data demonstrate that aging leads to decreased NO bioavailability because of endothelial NO synthase dysfunction and uncoupling of the enzyme leading to endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and promotion of adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes into cardiovascular tissue, all of which was more prominent in aged GPx-1(-/-) mice.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2013-12-04", "authors": ["MatthiasOelze", "SwenjaKr\u00f6ller-Sch\u00f6n", "SebastianSteven", "EdithLubos", "ChristopherDoppler", "MichaelHausding", "SilkeTobias", "ChristophBrochhausen", "HuigeLi", "MichaelTorzewski", "PhilipWenzel", "MarkusBachschmid", "Karl JLackner", "EberhardSchulz", "ThomasM\u00fcnzel", "AndreasDaiber"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01602"}

{"title": "Resveratrol attenuates left ventricular remodeling in old rats with COPD induced by cigarette smoke exposure and LPS instillation.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate left cardiac damage and the cardioprotective effects of resveratrol in old rats with COPD. Rats 22 months old were divided into three groups: control (CTL), smoking and lipopolysaccharides (SM/LPS), and SM/LPS plus resveratrol (SM/LPS-Res). Cardiac function, pathology, oxidative stress, and apoptosis index were measured. Expression of myocardial SIRT1 was studied by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot detection. The heart weight-body weight ratio (LVW/BW) increased in the SM/LPS group compared with the CTL group. Both the LVW/BW and the area of fibrosis in the SM/LPS-Res group decreased compared with those in the SM/LPS group. 8-OHdG expression increased in cardiac tissue of rats in the SM/LPS group, which could be inhibited by resveratrol. Resveratrol significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the cardiac malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level in the SM/LPS-Res group. There was a significant decrease in the extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the SM/LPS-Res group compared with the SM/LPS group. SIRT1 mRNA increased in the SM/LPS-Res group compared with the SM/LPS group.

{"title": "Current status of induced pluripotent stem cells in cardiac tissue regeneration and engineering.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with damage to the myocardium which results in a great loss of functional cardiomyocytes. As one of the most terminally differentiated organs, the endogenous regenerative potentials of adult hearts are extremely limited and insufficient to compensate for the myocardial loss occurring after MI. Consequentially, exogenous regenerative strategies, especially cell replacement therapy, have emerged and attracted increasing more attention in the field of cardiac tissue regeneration. A renewable source of seeding cells is therefore one of the most important subject in the field. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells that are derived from somatic cells by reprogramming, represent a promising candidate due to their high potentials for self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and more importantly, they provide an invaluable method of deriving patient-specific pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, iPSC-based cardiac tissue regeneration and engineering has been extensively investigated in recent years. This review will discuss the achievements and current status in this field, including development of iPSC derivation, in vitro strategies for cardiac generation from iPSCs, cardiac application of iPSCs, challenges confronted at present as well as perspective in the future.", "journal": "Regenerative medicine research", "date": "2013-12-01", "authors": ["ZhiqiangLiu", "JinZhou", "HaibinWang", "MenggeZhao", "ChangyongWang"], "doi": "10.1186/2050-490X-1-6\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1097/00001573-200403000-00017\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.11.040\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.04.040\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1038/nature07040\n10.1084/jem.20061469\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000064899.53876.A3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.054\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.778795\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.05.009\n10.1007/s12015-010-9123-8\n10.1038/nature05944\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.11.008\n10.1016/j.diff.2010.03.002\n10.1038/nprot.2010.16\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.10.014\n10.1073/pnas.0905284106\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.11.014\n10.1002/mrd.21117\n10.1074/jbc.M110.150540\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015947\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024501\n10.1038/nbt1374\n10.1073/pnas.0711983105\n10.1016/j.cub.2008.05.010\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0317\n10.1038/nbt.1503\n10.1126/science.1162494\n10.1126/science.1154884\n10.1073/pnas.0908450106\n10.1182/blood-2009-02-204800\n10.1182/blood-2009-02-203695\n10.1242/jcs.054783\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.09.008\n10.1089/scd.2009.0314\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.06.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019743\n10.1681/ASN.2011010106\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.05.011\n10.1126/science.1164270\n10.2183/pjab.85.348\n10.1186/gb-2009-10-5-220\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.04.005\n10.1038/nature07863\n10.1073/pnas.0901471106\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.05.005\n10.1126/science.1172482\n10.1038/nmeth.1426\n10.1038/emboj.2011.2\n10.1126/science.1088547\n10.1038/nature07864\n10.1038/nature08129\n10.1126/science.1152092\n10.1073/pnas.0801677105\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.865154\n10.1002/stem.1083\n10.1002/stem.1104\n10.3390/ijms13033598\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243139\n10.1038/nature09855\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.041\n10.1126/science.1158799\n10.1038/nature07677\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.769562\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023657\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1093/cvr/cvq189\n10.1089/scd.2011.0075\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.052\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.868885\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.08.008\n10.1096/fj.08-128546\n10.1096/fj.09-139477\n10.1096/fj.09-145177\n10.1186/1471-213X-10-98\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014414\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016734\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0235\n10.1002/jcb.23118\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.08.052\n10.1063/1.1481962\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.044\n10.3727/096368911X627561\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008443\n10.2217/rme.09.83\n10.1002/bit.23301\n10.2217/rme.10.103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.087684\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr166\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.06.062\n10.1089/scd.2011.0131\n10.1038/nature10135\n10.1073/pnas.0905729106\n10.1038/nature08320\n10.1098/rstb.2011.0026\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.12.001\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.02.040"}

The pathogenic mechanisms implicated are diverse, inducing functional and structural changes in the myocardium. Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) plays an important role in modulating the cell cycle, and helps the differentiation and proliferation of cardiac tissue inhibiting apoptosis. Experimental studies have suggested the role of IGF-1 in alcohol-induced cardiac damage. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on IGF-1 myocardial expression and to compare this expression in cases of hypertension and other cardiac diseases.\nWe studied heart samples from human organ donors: 10 healthy donors, 16 with hypertension, 23 with chronic alcohol consumption and 7 with other causes of cardiac disease. IGF-1 myocardial expression was evaluated with a specific immunohistochemistry assay using a semi-quantitative method.\nA significant decrease in IGF-1 myocardial expression was observed comparing all the cases included with control donors. This decrease in IGF-1 myocardial expression was significantly lower in the group of donors with chronic alcohol consumption compared to controls. On group evaluation according to the presence of CMP, donors with chronic alcohol consumption without CMP presented significantly lower IGF-1 expression than controls, whereas donors with chronic alcohol consumption with CMP showed a downward trend without achieving significance.\nChronic alcohol consumption significantly reduces IGF-1 myocardial expression.

{"title": "Rapid induction of aldosterone synthesis in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes under high glucose conditions.", "abstract": "In addition to classical adrenal cortical biosynthetic pathway, there is increasing evidence that aldosterone is produced in extra-adrenal tissues. Although we previously reported aldosterone production in the heart, the concept of cardiac aldosterone synthesis remains controversial. This is partly due to lack of established experimental models representing aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression in robustly reproducible fashion. We herein investigated suitable conditions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) culture system producing CYP11B2 with considerable efficacy. NRCMs were cultured with various glucose doses for 2-24 hours. CYP11B2 mRNA expression and aldosterone concentrations secreted from NRCMs were determined using real-time PCR and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. We found that suitable conditions for CYP11B2 induction included four-hour incubation with high glucose conditions. Under these particular conditions, CYP11B2 expression, in accordance with aldosterone secretion, was significantly increased compared to those observed in the cells cultured under standard-glucose condition. Angiotensin II receptor blocker partially inhibited this CYP11B2 induction, suggesting that there is local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation under high glucose conditions. The suitable conditions for CYP11B2 induction in NRCMs culture system are now clarified: high-glucose conditions with relatively brief period of culture promote CYP11B2 expression in cardiomyocytes. The current system will help to accelerate further progress in research on cardiac tissue aldosterone synthesis.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["MasamiFujisaki", "TomohisaNagoshi", "TetsuoNishikawa", "TaroDate", "MichihiroYoshimura"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/161396"}

The high stiffness and hydrophobicity of the PCL fiber mesh does not provide significant cell attachment and proliferation in cardiac tissue engineering. Towards this goal, the study focused on a compound of PCL and oligomer hydrogel [Bisphenol A ethoxylated dimethacrylate (BPAEDMA)] processed into electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds. The composition, morphology and mechanical properties of the compound scaffolds, composed of varying ratios of PCL and hydrogel were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analyzer. The elastic modulus of PCL/BPAEDMA nanofibrous scaffolds was shown to be varying the BPAEDMA weight fraction and was decreased by increasing the BPAEDMA weight fraction. Compound fiber meshes containing 75 wt % BPAEDMA oligomer hydrogel exhibited lower modulus (3.55 MPa) and contact angle of 25(o) . Rabbit cardiac cells cultured for 10 days on these PCL/BPAEDMA compound nanofibrous scaffolds remained viable and expressed cardiac troponin and alpha-actinin proteins for the normal functioning of myocardium. Cell adhesion and proliferations were significantly increased on compound fiber meshes containing 75 wt % BPAEDMA, when compared with other nanofibrous scaffolds. The results observed that the produced PCL/BPAEDMA compound nanofibrous scaffolds promote cell adhesion, proliferation and normal functioning of cardiac cells to clinically beneficial levels, relevant for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Human-specific hypomethylation of CENPJ, a key brain size regulator.", "abstract": "Both the enlarged brain and concurrent highly developed cognitive skills are often seen as distinctive characteristics that set humans apart from other primates. Despite this obvious differentiation, the genetic mechanisms that underlie such human-specific traits are not clearly understood. In particular, whether epigenetic regulations may play a key role in human brain evolution remain elusive. In this study, we used bisulfite sequencing to compare the methylation patterns of four known genes that regulate brain size (ASPM, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, and MCPH1) in the prefrontal cortex among several primate species spanning the major lineages of primates (i.e., humans, great apes, lesser apes, and Old World monkeys). The results showed a human-specific hypomethylation in the 5' UTR of CENPJ in the brain, where methylation levels among humans are only about one-third of those found among nonhuman primates. Similar methylation patterns were also detected in liver, kidney, and heart tissues, although the between-species differences were much less pronounced than those in the brain. Further in vitro methylation assays indicated that the methylation status of the CENPJ promoter could influence its expression. We also detected a large difference in CENPJ expression in the human and nonhuman primate brains of both adult individuals and throughout the major stages of fetal brain development. The hypomethylation and comparatively high expression of CENPJ in the central nervous system of humans suggest that a human-specific--and likely heritable--epigenetic modification likely occurred during human evolution, potentially leading to a much larger neural progenitor pool during human brain development, which may have eventually contributed to the dramatically enlarged brain and highly developed cognitive abilities associated with humans.", "journal": "Molecular biology and evolution", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["LeiShi", "QiangLin", "BingSu"], "doi": "10.1093/molbev/mst231"}
{"title": "Diuretics prevent thiazolidinedione-induced cardiac hypertrophy without compromising insulin-sensitizing effects in mice.", "abstract": "Much concern has arisen regarding critical adverse effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on cardiac tissue. Although TZD-induced cardiac hypertrophy (CH) has been attributed to an increase in plasma volume or a change in cardiac nutrient preference, causative roles have not been established. To test the hypothesis that volume expansion directly mediates rosiglitazone-induced CH, mice were fed a high-fat diet with rosiglitazone, and cardiac and metabolic consequences were examined. Rosiglitazone treatment induced volume expansion and CH in wild-type and PPAR\u03b3 heterozygous knockout (Pparg(+/-)) mice, but not in mice defective for ligand binding (Pparg(P465L/+)). Cotreatment with the diuretic furosemide in wild-type mice attenuated rosiglitazone-induced CH, hypertrophic gene reprogramming, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, hypertrophy-related signal activation, and left ventricular dysfunction. Similar changes were observed in mice treated with pioglitazone. The diuretics spironolactone and trichlormethiazide, but not amiloride, attenuated rosiglitazone effects on volume expansion and CH. Interestingly, expression of glucose and lipid metabolism genes in the heart was altered by rosiglitazone, but these changes were not attenuated by furosemide cotreatment. Importantly, rosiglitazone-mediated whole-body metabolic improvements were not affected by furosemide cotreatment. We conclude that releasing plasma volume reduces adverse effects of TZD-induced volume expansion and cardiac events without compromising TZD actions in metabolic switch in the heart and whole-body insulin sensitivity.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["Cherng-ShyangChang", "Pei-JaneTsai", "Junne-MingSung", "Ju-YiChen", "Li-ChunHo", "KumarPandya", "NobuyoMaeda", "Yau-ShengTsai"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.10.020"}

Tissues assembled from progenitor-derived myocytes and neonate myocytes demonstrated similar cytoskeletal architectures but different gap junction organization and electromechanical properties.

{"title": "Possible involvement of HSP90-HSF1 multichaperone complex in impairment of HSP72 induction in the failing heart following myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that an increase in the myocardial level of heat-shock protein 72 (HSP72) protects viable cardiac tissue against myocardial infarction (MI)-induced stress. However, the induction of HSP72 after exposure to heat shock (HS) is blunted in the failing rat heart following MI. The mechanisms underlying this impairment in the HSP72 induction ability of the failing heart are not yet clearly defined. In the present study, we examined the involvement in heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor of HSPs, in decreased ability for HSP72 induction in the failing rat heart following MI. In the failing heart, nuclear translocation of the HSF1 after exposure to hyperthermia was markedly reduced, whereas HSF1 in the cytosolic fraction and the HSP90 chaperone complex containing HSF1, a repressor of HSF1, were increased. Treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygel-danamycin, appeared to dissociate the interaction of HSF1 with HSP90, and then induced HSP72 in the failing heart after exposure to hyperthermia.

{"title": "Bariatric surgery modulates circulating and cardiac metabolites.", "abstract": "Bariatric procedures such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation offer profound metabolic enhancement in addition to their well-recognized weight loss effects.

The aim of the study was to compare the metabolic profiles of plasma and heart tissue extracts from RYGB- and sham-operated Wistar rats to identify the systemic and cardiac signature of metabolic surgery. A total of 27 male Wistar rats were housed individually for a week and subsequently underwent RYGB (n = 13) or sham (n = 14) operation. At week 8 postoperation, a total of 27 plasma samples and 16 heart tissue samples (8 RYGB; 8 Sham) were collected from animals and analyzed using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS) to characterize the global metabolite perturbation induced by RYGB operation. Plasma bile acids, phosphocholines, amino acids, energy-related metabolites, nucleosides and amine metabolites, and cardiac glycogen and amino acids were found to be altered in the RYGB operated group. Correlation networks were used to identify metabolite association. The metabolic phenotype of this bariatric surgical model inferred systematic change in both myocardial and systemic activity post surgery. The altered metabolic profile following bariatric surgery reflects an enhancement of cardiac energy metabolism through TCA cycle intermediates, cardiorenal protective activity, and biochemical caloric restriction. These surgically induced metabolic shifts identify some of the potential mechanisms that contribute toward bariatric cardioprotection through gut microbiota ecological fluxes and an enterocardiac axis to shield against metabolic syndrome of cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["HutanAshrafian", "Jia VLi", "KonstantinaSpagou", "LeanneHarling", "PerrineMasson", "AraDarzi", "Jeremy KNicholson", "ElaineHolmes", "ThanosAthanasiou"], "doi": "10.1021/pr400748f"}

We observed significant alterations in miRNA and gene expression profile after I/R injury. There were 39 miRNAs significantly downregulated and 20 upregulated up to 1.5 fold in heart grafts with I/R injury compared with the grafts without I/R. 48 genes were observed with 3 fold change and p<0.05 and 18 signalling pathways were enriched using Keggs pathway library.

{"title": "Coptisine protects rat heart against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing myocardial apoptosis and inflammation.", "abstract": "Protecting the heart from myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) damage is the focus of intense research. Coptisine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Coptidis Rhizoma. The present study investigated the potential effect of coptisine on myocardial I/R damage in rats and the underlying mechanisms.\nElectrocardiogram examination showed that the administration of coptisine 10 min before ischemia significantly decreased I/R-induced arrhythmia after 30 min ischemia followed by 3 h reperfusion. The release of cardiac markers was also limited. Echocardiography was performed before ischemia and 24 h post-I/R, separately. The M-mode records showed that the reductions of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were attenuated in coptisine-treated rats compared with the I/R rats. Similar results were obtained with Evans Blue/triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, in which coptisine notably reduced infarct size. Moreover, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay demonstrated coptisine suppressed myocardial apoptosis, which may be related to the upregulation of Bcl-2 protein and inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Coptisine treatment also attenuated the proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in heart tissue. Additionally, Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis showed that coptisine markedly reduced Rho, Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1), and ROCK2 expression and attenuated the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit-1, a downstream target of ROCK.\nCoptisine exerts pronounced cardioprotection in rats subjected to myocardial I/R likely through suppressing myocardial apoptosis and inflammation by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK pathway.", "journal": "Atherosclerosis", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["JingGuo", "Shou-BaoWang", "Tian-YiYuan", "Yu-JieWu", "YuYan", "LiLi", "Xiao-NaXu", "Li-LiGong", "Hai-LinQin", "Lian-HuaFang", "Guan-HuaDu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.10.003"}

However, it has other nonimmune functions: in the cardiovascular system, it is a regulator of heart hypertrophy and locally, in coated vascular stents, it inhibits vascular wall cell growth and hence neointimal formation/restenosis. Because the mTOR pathway plays major roles in normal cell growth, metabolism, and survival, we hypothesized that inhibiting it with rapamycin before an acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) would confer cardioprotection by virtue of slowing down cardiac function and metabolism.\nYorkshire pigs received either placebo or 4 mg/d rapamycin orally for 7 days before the IRI. All animals underwent median sternotomy, and the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 60 minutes followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressure-volume data were collected throughout the operation. The ischemic and infarcted areas were determined by monastral blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, respectively, and plasma cardiac troponin I concentration. mTOR kinase activities were monitored in remote cardiac tissue by Western blotting with specific antibodies against mTOR substrates phosphorylating sites.\nRapamycin before treatment impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation, attenuated cardiac function during IRI, and increased myocardial necrosis.

In this study, we focused on the spatiotemporal development of the ID in the EHTs constructed by mixing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with collagen/Matrigel, and investigated the effect of 3D microenvironment provided by collagen/Matrigel matrix on the formation of ID. By histological and immmunofluorescent staining, the spatiotemporal distribution of ID-related junctions was detected. Furthermore, the ultra-structures of the ID in different developmental stages were observed under transmission electron microscope. In addition, the expression of the related proteins was quantitatively analyzed. The results indicate that accompanying the re-organization of cardiomyocytes in collagen/Matrigel matrix, the proteins of adherens junctions, desmosomes and gap junctions redistributed from diffused distribution to intercellular regions to form an integrated ID. The adherens junction and desmosome which are related with mechanical connection appeared earlier than gap junction which is essential for electrochemical coupling.

Here we study effects from cell coupling on APD heterogeneity in cardiac tissue in numerical simulations using the ionic TP06 model for human cardiac tissue. We show that the effect of cell coupling on APD heterogeneity can be described mathematically using a Gaussian Green's function approach. This relates the problem of electrotonic interactions to a wide range of classical problems in physics, chemistry and biology, for which robust methods exist. We show that, both for determining effects of tissue heterogeneity from cell heterogeneity (forward problem) as well as for determining cell properties from tissue level measurements (inverse problem), this approach is promising.

We used computational modeling of tissue contraction and assembly mechanics in conjunction with microfabricated constraints to guide the design of aligned and functional 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiac microtissues that we term cardiac microwires (CMWs). Miniaturization of the platform circumvented the need for tissue vascularization and enabled higher-throughput image-based analysis of CMW drug responsiveness. CMW tissue properties could be tuned using electromechanical stimuli and cell composition. Specifically, controlling self-assembly of 3D tissues in aligned collagen, and pacing with point stimulation electrodes, were found to promote cardiac maturation-associated gene expression and in vivo-like electrical signal propagation. Furthermore, screening a range of hPSC-derived cardiac cell ratios identified that 75% NKX2 Homeobox 5 (NKX2-5)+ cardiomyocytes and 25% Cluster of Differentiation 90 OR (CD90)+ nonmyocytes optimized tissue remodeling dynamics and yielded enhanced structural and functional properties. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the optimized platform in a tachycardic model of arrhythmogenesis, an aspect of cardiac electrophysiology not previously recapitulated in 3D in vitro hPSC-derived cardiac microtissue models.

{"title": "Inhibition of murine cardiomyocyte respiration by amine local anesthetics.", "abstract": "The hydrophobic amino acyl amide-linked local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine and bupivacaine) impose potent cardiac toxicity and direct mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate these adverse events, an in vitro system was employed to measure their effects on O2 consumption (cellular respiration) by murine myocardium. Specimens were collected from the ventricular myocardium and immediately immersed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer saturated with 95\u00a0% O2:5\u00a0% CO2. O2 concentration was determined as a function of time from the phosphorescence decay rates of Pd(II)-meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-tetrabenzoporphyrin. Myocardial O2 consumption was linear with time (zero-order kinetics); its rate (k, in \u03bcM\u00a0O2\u00a0min(-1)), thus, was the negative of the slope of [O2] vs. time. Cyanide inhibited O2 consumption, confirming the oxidation occurred in the respiratory chain. Lidocaine and bupivacaine produced immediate and sustained inhibition of cellular respiration at plasma concentrations of the drugs (low micromolar range). Bupivacaine was twice as potent as lidocaine. The inhibition was dose-dependent, saturating at concentrations \u226530\u00a0\u03bcM. At saturating doses, lidocaine produced ~20\u00a0% inhibition and bupivacaine ~40\u00a0% inhibition. Cellular ATP was also decreased in the presence of 30\u00a0\u03bcM lidocaine or bupivacaine.

{"title": "Induction of a monocyte/macrophage phenotype switch by mesenchymal stem cells might contribute to improved infarct healing postacute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Inadequate healing following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can lead to the development of heart failure. The ischemic myocardium triggers an inflammatory response that clears cell debris and initiates the onset of scar tissue formation. The duration and intensity of this inflammatory response have been linked to the cardiac functioning post-AMI. In order to diminish scar tissue formation and stimulate regeneration of cardiac tissue, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) have been applied post-AMI and showed beneficial effects on cardiac function. However, other than the expected regeneration of cardiac tissue, modulation of the inflammatory response post-AMI, especially related to an effect on monocytes/macrophages, was recently found to be an important aspect of MSC therapy. In healing post-AMI, monocytes and macrophages are key players that can either stimulate or repress inflammation using different phenotypes. Increased levels of the proinflammatory phenotype have clinically been associated with poor cardiac functional outcome post-AMI. MSC have been suggested to switch the monocytes/macrophages phenotype into a more anti-inflammatory state and might therefore beneficially influence the duration and intensity of the inflammatory response and subsequent cardiac function post-AMI.

The obtained results using the two technologies were similar with around 35 genes differentially expressed using both technologies. Absence of CD36 led to down-regulation of the expression of three groups of genes involved in pathways of FA metabolism, angiogenesis/apoptosis and structure. These data are consistent with the fact that the CD36 protein binds FA and thrombospondin 1 invoved respectively in lipid metabolism and anti-angiogenic activities.

{"title": "Computational methods to reduce uncertainty in the estimation of cardiac conduction properties from electroanatomical recordings.", "abstract": "Cardiac imaging is routinely used to evaluate cardiac tissue properties prior to therapy. By integrating the structural information with electrophysiological data from e.g. electroanatomical mapping systems, knowledge of the properties of the cardiac tissue can be further refined. However, as in other clinical modalities, electrophysiological data are often sparse and noisy, and this results in high levels of uncertainty in the estimated quantities. In this study, we develop a methodology based on Bayesian inference, coupled with a computationally efficient model of electrical propagation to achieve two main aims: (1) to quantify values and associated uncertainty for different tissue conduction properties inferred from electroanatomical data, and (2) to design strategies to optimize the location and number of measurements required to maximize information and reduce uncertainty. The methodology is validated in an in silico study performed using simulated data obtained from a human image-based ventricular model, including realistic fibre orientation and a transmural scar. We demonstrate that the method provides a simultaneous description of clinically-relevant electrophysiological conduction properties and their associated uncertainty for various levels of noise. By using the developed methodology to investigate how the uncertainty decreases in response to added measurements, we then derive an a priori index for placing electrophysiological measurements in order to optimize the information content of the collected data. Results show that the derived index has a clear benefit in minimizing the uncertainty of inferred conduction properties compared to a random distribution of measurements, reducing the number of required measurements by over 50% in several of the investigated settings.

Male Fischer rats that were 28 days old were randomly divided into a control group (CG, n = 16) and a protein-restricted group (PRG, n = 16). After weaning, CG and PRG animals received isocaloric diets containing 15 and 6% protein, respectively, for 35 days. Biometric parameters were then measured, and the hearts were removed for the analysis of contractile function and calcium transient in isolated cardiomyocytes of the left ventricule (LV), and the quantification of calcium and collagen fibers in LV myocardium. PRG animals had lower body weight (BW) and LV weight (LVW), an increased LVW to BW ratio and a higher proportion of collagen fibers than CG animals. PRG animals exhibited reduced tissue levels of calcium, reduced the length, width and volume of cardiomyocytes and their sarcomere length compared to CG animals. Cardiomyocytes from PRG animals had a lower amplitude of shortening, a slower time to the peak of shortening and a longer time to half-relaxation than those from the CG. Cardiomyocytes from PRG animals also presented a lower peak of calcium transient and a longer calcium transient decay time than CG animals. Taken together, the results indicate that short-term PR after weaning induces a marked structural remodeling of the myocardium parenchyma and stroma that coexists with contractile dysfunctions in single LV cardiomyocytes of rats, which is probably associated with pathological changes of the intracellular calcium kinetics, rather than inadequate available amounts of this mineral in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2013-11-20", "authors": ["Arlete RPenitente", "R\u00f4mulo DNovaes", "Deocl\u00e9cio AChianca", "M\u00e1rcia Fda Silva", "Marcelo ESilva", "Aline M ASouza", "SilviaGuatimosim", "Pedro W MAlmeida", "M\u00e1rcia N MAlves", "Leonardo BFelix", "Cl\u00f3vis ANeves", "Ant\u00f4nio JNatali"], "doi": "10.1159/000355943"}

To date, little is known about molecular mechanisms regulating cardiac sympathetic innervation. The aim of the study was to determine the role of fibroblasts in heart sympathetic innervation. RT-qPCR and western-blots analysis performed in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts isolated from healthy adult rat hearts revealed that Pro-Nerve growth factor (NGF) and pro-differentiating mature NGF were the most abundant neurotrophins expressed in cardiac fibroblasts while barely detectable in cardiomyocytes. When cultured with cardiac fibroblasts or fibroblast-conditioned medium, PC12 cells differentiated into/sympathetic-like neurons expressing axonal marker Tau-1 at neurites in contact with cardiomyocytes. This was prevented by anti-NGF blocking antibodies suggesting a paracrine action of NGF secreted by fibroblasts. When co-cultured with cardiomyocytes to mimic neurocardiac synapse, differentiated PC12 cells exhibited enhanced norepinephrine secretion as quantified by HPLC compared to PC12 cultured alone while co-culture with fibroblasts had no effect. However, when supplemented to PC12-cardiomyocytes co-culture, fibroblasts allowed long-term survival of the neurocardiac synapse. Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) isolated from myocardial infarction rat hearts exhibited significantly higher mature NGF expression than normal fibroblasts and also promoted PC12 cells differentiation. Within the ischemic area lacking cardiomyocytes and neurocardiac synapses, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was increased and associated with local anarchical and immature sympathetic hyperinnervation but tissue norepinephrine content was similar to that of normal cardiac tissue, suggesting depressed sympathetic function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time that fibroblasts are essential for the setting of cardiac sympathetic innervation and neurocardiac synapse stability.

When combined with congenital heart disease (CHD) both morbidity and mortality may be greater compared to CHD alone. Whether HCM in DS patients is related to having trisomy 21 versus a second site mutation is unknown.\nWe report a case of severe HCM in an infant with DS in combination with double outlet right ventricle (DORV) who required surgery for relive of sub-aortic obstruction and congestive heart failure. We predicted that this infant would have a second site mutation involving either a sarcomeric protein or metabolic disorder as a cause for his HCM. Using current genetic and metabolic testing as well as histologic assessment of excised cardiac tissue we sought to further characterize the nature of the HCM. A successful resection of sub-aortic stenosis and DORV repair was performed. Genetic and metabolic testing was negative for gene defects and/or syndromes commonly associated with familial HCM. Excised cardiac tissue from the ventricular septum exhibited myocyte hypertrophy and sub-endocardial fibrosis but no sarcomeric disarray, myocyte fibrosis or glycogen storage. Metabolic testing for common forms of mitochondrial disease was negative. Post-operative echocardiograms show persistent, non-obstructive septal hypertrophy.\nUnlike prior reports, this child required a surgical intervention to relieve his sub-aortic obstruction. Thus, HCM in this population can be more serious that previously suspected. Although testing did not reveal the cause of his HCM, we still suggest screening for known causes of HSC until the etiology of the HCM in DS is well understood.", "journal": "The American journal of case reports", "date": "2013-11-14", "authors": ["LaxmiGhimire", "OssamaTawffik", "Valerie ASchroeder"], "doi": "10.12659/AJCR.889581"}

We previously reported that ocotillol is capable of enhancing the antitumor activity of Dox; however, the effects of ocotillol on its cardiotoxicity remain unclear. In the current study, the effects of ocotillol on the toxicity of Dox were investigated, particularly its role in cardiotoxicity. In the acute injury model, pre\u2011administration of ocotillol prolonged the survival time. In the chronic animal model, pre\u2011administration of ocotillol decreased the elevated levels of plasma creatine kinase (CK) and CK\u2011MB, as well as attenuated the pathological changes that occurred. Pre\u2011treatment with ocotillol ameliorated the decreased glutathione level and reduced the cumulated malondialdehyde in the heart tissue. In addition, pre\u2011treatment with ocotillol restored the lowered white blood cell count.

{"title": "Can stem cells really regenerate the human heart? Use your noggin, dickkopf! Lessons from developmental biology.", "abstract": "The human heart is the first organ to develop and its development is fairly well characterised. In theory, the heart has the capacity to regenerate, as its cardiomyocytes may be capable of cell division and the adult heart contains a cardiac stem cell niche, presumably capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes and other cardiac-associated cell types. However, as with most other organs, these mechanisms are not activated upon serious injury. Several experimental options to induce regeneration of the damaged heart tissue are available: activate the endogenous cardiomyocytes to divide, coax the endogenous population of stem cells to divide and differentiate, or add exogenous cell-based therapy to replace the lost cardiac tissue. This review is a summary of the recent research into all these avenues, discussing the reasons for the limited successes of clinical trials using stem cells after cardiac injury and explaining new advances in basic science. It concludes with a reiteration that chances of successful regeneration would be improved by understanding and implementing the basics of heart development and stem cell biology.", "journal": "Cardiovascular journal of Africa", "date": "2013-11-13", "authors": ["PaulaSommer"], "doi": "10.5830/CVJA-2013-045"}

Sesamin (Ses), an active component extracted from sesame seeds, exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, possible protective mechanisms of Ses on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity were investigated in rats and cultured H9C2 cells. We demonstrated that Ses exhibits a significant protective effect on cardiac tissue in animal and cell models of DOX-induced cardiac injury. Moreover, Ses can ameliorate DOX-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Further studies suggested that Ses is able to up-regulate the protein expression of Mn-SOD in normal rats and to restore the decreased expression of Mn-SOD in DOX-induced cardiac injury rats. Exposure to Ses or DOX alone slightly increased the protein expression of Sirt1; however, a more remarkable increase in Sirt1 protein level was detected in the Ses+DOX group. Treatment with a pan-sirtuin inhibitor (nicotinamide) or a Sirt1-specific inhibitor (EX-527) partially antagonised the effect of Ses on DOX-induced mitochondrial damage and completely abolished the effect of Ses on Mn-SOD expression.

While numerous reports have demonstrated increased myocardial fatty acid (FA) utilization in obese T2DM animal models, this diabetic phenotype has yet to be demonstrated in non-obese animal models of T2DM. Therefore, the present study investigates functional, metabolic, and genomic differences in myocardial FA metabolism in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats. The study utilized Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats at the age of 24 weeks. Each rat was imaged with small animal positron emission tomography (PET) to estimate myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial FA metabolism. Echocardiograms (ECHOs) were performed to assess cardiac function. Levels of triglycerides (TG) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured in both plasma and cardiac tissues. Finally, expression profiles for 168 genes that have been implicated in diabetes and FA metabolism were measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) arrays. GK rats exhibited increased NEFA and TG in both plasma and cardiac tissue. Quantitative PET imaging suggests that GK rats have increased FA metabolism. ECHO data indicates that GK rats have a significant increase in left ventricle mass index (LVMI) and decrease in peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E') compared to Wistar rats, suggesting structural remodeling and impaired diastolic function. Of the 84 genes in each the diabetes and FA metabolism arrays, 17 genes in the diabetes array and 41 genes in the FA metabolism array were significantly up-regulated in GK rats.

Strikingly, the patterns of expression of LncRNA differed between plasma and other tissue during HF. LncRNA expression was associated with LncRNA length in all samples but not in plasma during HF, which suggests that the global association of LncRNA expression and LncRNA length in plasma could be biomarkers for HF. In total, 32 LncRNAs all expressed in the heart, whole blood and plasma showed changed expression with HF, so they may be biomarkers in HF. In addition, sense-overlapped LncRNAs tended to show consistent expression with their paired coding genes, whereas antisense-overlapped LncRNAs tended to show the opposite expression in plasma; so different types of LncRNAs may have different characteristics in HF. Interestingly, we revealed an inverse correlation between changes in expression of LncRNAs in plasma and in heart, so circulating levels of LncRNAs may not represent just passive leakage from the HF heart but also active regulation or release of circulatory cells or other cells during HF.\nWe reveal stable expression of LncRNAs in plasma during HF, which suggests a newly described component in plasma.

We investigated the possible underlying mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of this therapy, especially those linked to endogenous regeneration. FGF1- and NRG1-loaded MPs were prepared using a multiple emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Seventy-three female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, and MPs were intramyocardially injected in the peri-infarcted zone four days later. Cardiac function, heart tissue remodeling, revascularization, apoptosis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and stem cell homing were evaluated one week and three months after treatment. MPs were shown to efficiently encapsulate FGF1 and NRG1, releasing the bioactive proteins in a sustained manner. Three months after treatment, a statistically significant improvement in cardiac function was detected in rats treated with growth factor-loaded MPs (FGF1, NRG1, or FGF1/NRG1). The therapy led to inhibition of cardiac remodeling with smaller infarct size, a lower fibrosis degree and induction of tissue revascularization.

ISO (150 mg/kg, subcutaneous, two doses administered at 24-hour intervals) treatment induced significant decreases in P waves and QRS complexes (p<0.01), as well as a significant increase in ST segments. Moreover, ISO-treated rats exhibited decreases in left-ventricular systolic pressure, maximal rate of developed left ventricular pressure (+dP/dtmax) and minimal rate of developed left ventricular pressure (-dP/dtmax), in addition to significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and creatine kinase activity. Heart rate, however, was not significantly altered. And the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were decreased, whereas the activity of malondialdehyde was increased in the ISO-treated group. ISO-treated group also showed increased caspase-3 level, release of inflammatory markers and neutrophil infiltration in heart tissue. KRG pretreatment (250 and 500 mg/kg, respectively) significantly ameliorated almost all of the parameters of heart failure and myocardial injury induced by ISO. The protective effect of KRG on ISO-induced cardiac injury was further confirmed by histopathological study. In this regard, ISO treatment induced fewer morphological changes in rats pretreated with 250 or 500 mg/kg of KRG. Compared with the control group, all indexes in rats administered KRG (500 mg/kg) alone were unaltered (p>0.05).

During the period 2005 to 2006, 1281 salmon carcasses (628 male, 652 female) were collected throughout the spawning season and from the entire spawning reaches of the Chena and Salcha Rivers. For each fish, infection status was determined by culture method and visual inspection of lesions of heart tissue as uninfected (culture negative), infected without lesions (culture positive with no visible lesions), and infected with lesions (culture positive with visible lesions), and spawning status was determined by visually inspecting the percentage of gametes remaining as full-spawned (<10%), partial-spawned (10-50%), and unspawned (>50%). Among the 3 groups, the proportion of full-spawned (i.e. spawning success) females was lower for those infected without lesions (69%) than those uninfected (87%) and infected with lesions (86%), but this did not apply to males (uninfected 42%, infected without lesions 38%, infected with lesions 41%). At the population level, the combined (infected and uninfected) proportion of female spawning success was 86%, compared to 87% when all females were assumed uninfected. These data suggest that while Ichthyophonus infection slightly reduces spawning success of infected females, its impact on the spawning population as a whole appears minimal.", "journal": "Diseases of aquatic organisms", "date": "2013-11-07", "authors": ["ToshihideHamazaki", "ErynKahler", "Bonnie MBorba", "TamaraBurton"], "doi": "10.3354/dao02657"}
{"title": "A novel insight into the cardiotoxicity of antineoplastic drug doxorubicin.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is a commonly used antineoplastic agent in the treatment of many types of cancer. Little is known about the interactions of doxorubicin with cardiac biomolecules. Serious cardiotoxicity including dilated cardiomyopathy often resulting in a fatal congestive heart failure may occur as a consequence of chemotherapy with doxorubicin. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exposure to doxorubicin on the changes in major amino acids in tissue of cardiac muscle (proline, taurine, glutamic acid, arginine, aspartic acid, leucine, glycine, valine, alanine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine and serine). An in vitro interaction study was performed as a comparison of amino acid profiles in heart tissue before and after application of doxorubicin. We found that doxorubicin directly influences myocardial amino acid representation even at low concentrations. In addition, we performed an interaction study that resulted in the determination of breaking points for each of analyzed amino acids. Lysine, arginine, \u03b2-alanine, valine and serine were determined as the most sensitive amino acids. Additionally we compared amino acid profiles of myocardium before and after exposure to doxorubicin. The amount of amino acids after interaction with doxorubicin was significantly reduced (p = 0.05). This fact points at an ability of doxorubicin to induce changes in quantitative composition of amino acids in myocardium. Moreover, this confirms that the interactions between doxorubicin and amino acids may act as another factor most likely responsible for adverse effects of doxorubicin on myocardium.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2013-11-05", "authors": ["ZbynekHeger", "NataliaCernei", "JiriKudr", "JaromirGumulec", "IvaBlazkova", "OndrejZitka", "TomasEckschlager", "MarieStiborova", "VojtechAdam", "ReneKizek"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms141121629"}

In the injured heart, however, fibroblasts are activated and differentiate into myofibroblasts that proliferate and generate fibrosis as a component of the wound-healing response. This review discusses how fibroblasts and fibrosis, while essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the heart wall after injury, have undesirable electrophysiological effects by disrupting the normal electrical connectivity of cardiac tissue to increase the vulnerability to arrhythmias. We emphasize the dual contribution of fibrosis in altering source-sink relationships to create a vulnerable substrate while simultaneously facilitating the emergence of triggers such as afterdepolarization-induced premature ventricular complexes-both factors combining synergistically to promote initiation of reentry. We also discuss the potential role of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in directly altering myocyte electrophysiology in a pro-arrhythmic fashion. Insight into these processes may open up novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating arrhythmias in the setting of heart disease as well as avoiding potential arrhythmogenic consequences of cell-based cardiac regeneration therapy.

Three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds have been utilized as potential therapies for treating heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, native tissues have numerous properties that make them potentially useful scaffolding materials for recreating the native cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we have developed a pericardium-derived scaffold that mimics the natural myocardial extracellular environment and investigated its properties for cardiac tissue engineering. Human pericardium membranes (PMs) were decellularized to yield 3D macroporous pericardium scaffolds (PSs) with well-defined architecture and interconnected pores. PSs enabled human Sca-1(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) to migrate, survive, proliferate and differentiate at higher rates compared with decellularized pericardium membranes (DPMs) and collagen scaffolds (COLs). Interestingly, histological examination of subcutaneous transplanted scaffolds after one month revealed low immunological response, enhanced angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte differentiation in PSs compared to DPMs and COLs.

We tested the hypothesis that the activity of several types of proteases in heart and liver tissue is changed in the early stages of atherosclerosis development. Additionally, we evaluated whether increased serum lipids would induce anxiety in mice, as determined by using a 'plus-maze' test. The mice were administered P-407 by intraperitoneal injection twice a week for one month. P-407 administration to mice resulted in a marked increase in total serum cholesterol, atherogenic non-HDL-cholesterol, and especially in total triglycerides, and it also increased anxiety. Morphological changes observed in P-407-treated mice included contractile type changes in cardiomyocytes and foamy macrophages in liver. A significant increase of cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L (at 24 h) and aspartate protease cathepsin D (at both 24 h and 5 days) was determined in heart tissue following P-407 administration. However, no changes were noted in heart matrix metalloproteinase activity. The activity of cysteine and aspartate proteases was significantly increased in liver at both 24 hours and 5 days after P-407 administration. In conclusion, administration of P-407 to mice for one month resulted in increased anxiety, and more importantly, there was an increase in the activity of heart and liver proteases secondary to sustained dyslipidemia.

Energy starvation is known to exacerbate congestive heart failure, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1(Ser51) phosphorylation is increased in the failing heart. However, the effect of GCN2 during the evolution of congestive heart failure has not been tested. In this study, we examined the influence of GCN2 expression in response to a cardiac stress by inducing chronic pressure overload with transverse aortic constriction in wild-type and GCN2 knockout mice. Under basal conditions, GCN2 knockout mice had normal left ventricular structure and function, but after transverse aortic constriction, they demonstrated less contractile dysfunction, less increase in lung weight, less increase in lung inflammation and vascular remodeling, and less myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis compared with wild-type mice, despite an equivalent degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. As expected, GCN2 knockout attenuated transverse aortic constriction-induced cardiac eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1(Ser51) phosphorylation and preserved sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase expression compared with wild-type mice. Interestingly, the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly elevated in GCN2 knockout hearts, whereas in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes, selective knockdown of GCN2 increased Bcl-2 protein expression and enhanced myocyte resistance to an apoptotic stress. Collectively, our data support the notion that GCN2 impairs the ventricular adaptation to chronic pressure overload by reducing Bcl-2 expression and increasing cardiomyocyte susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli.

Recent meta-analyses have shown that TZDs are associated with an increased risk for the development of heart failure. To elucidate the mechanism underlying such a cardiac adverse effect, we used a (1)H NMR-based approach to examine the metabonomic profiles in the cardiac tissues treated with RSG (15 mg/kg body weight/day) or PIO (45 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks and found that the TZD treatments resulted in a significantly altered metabolic profile in hearts, which was associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TZDs led to an accumulation in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and a depletion of inosine. Consistently, AMP kinase, a signal pathway sensitive to the change in the intracellular concentrations of AMP, was activated in the cardiac tissues from the TZDs-treated rats. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed a significant induction of the genes involved in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotide but a reduction of those for the catabolism. Furthermore, the putative PPAR-responsive elements were identified in the 5'-flanking regions of the TZD-up-regulated genes such as adenylosuccinate synthase gene (Adss) and phosphoribosl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (Prps1), and the binding of PPAR\u03b3 to these motifs was confirmed by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that TZDs induced alterations in purine nucleotide metabolism in rat hearts via transcriptional regulation of the PPAR\u03b3-target genes, which may play an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy associated with TZDs.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2013-10-30", "authors": ["YanLiu", "XingYan", "GuangmeiMao", "LiFang", "BeileiZhao", "YahanLiu", "HuiruTang", "NanpingWang"], "doi": "10.1021/pr400587y"}

Vaccine development is one of CD prevention methods to protect people at risk. Two plasmids containing genes encoding a trans-sialidase protein (TcSP) and an amastigote-specific glycoprotein (TcSSP4) were used as DNA vaccines in a canine model. Splenomegaly was not found in either of the recombinant plasmid-immunized groups; however, cardiomegaly was absent in animals immunized only with the plasmid containing the TcSSP4 gene. The inflammation of subendocardial and myocardial tissues was prevented only with the immunization with TcSSP4 gene. In conclusion, the vaccination with these genes has a partial protective effect on the enlargement of splenic and cardiac tissues during the chronic CD and on microscopic hearth damage, since both plasmids prevented splenomegaly but only one avoided cardiomegaly, and the lesions in heart tissue of dog immunized with plasmid containing the TcSSP4 gene covered only subepicardial tissue.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2013-10-29", "authors": ["OliviaRodr\u00edguez-Morales", "Silvia CCarrillo-S\u00e1nchez", "HumbertoGarc\u00eda-Mendoza", "AlbertoAranda-Fraustro", "Martha ABallinas-Verdugo", "RicardoAlejandre-Aguilar", "Jos\u00e9 LuisRosales-Encina", "MaiteVallejo", "MinervaArce-Fonseca"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/826570"}

In this study, we aimed to rapidly, quantitatively, and differentially identify infections by these two parasite species in cultured PBT as well as identify potential host immune responses. Using real-time qPCR, we were successful in quantitatively detecting parasite-specific DNA from within host blood, gill, and heart tissues; positively identifying parasitic infections 44 days earlier than microscopy methods previously employed. Both gill and heart became heavily infected by both parasite species in PBT within two months of sea-cage culture, which was only mitigated by the administration of anthelmintic praziquantel. Nevertheless, fish were observed to mount an organ specific transcriptive immune response during infection that mirrored the relative quantity of pathogenic load. In heart, significant (3-6 fold) increases in IgM, MHC2, TCR\u03b2, and IL-8 transcription was observed in infected fish relative to uninfected controls; whereas in the gills only IgM transcription was observed to be induced (11 fold) by infection. Interestingly, the relative quantity of IgM transcription was highly correlated to the relative abundance of C.\u00a0orientalis but not C.\u00a0opisthorchis DNA in the gill samples, even though this organ showed high prevalence of DNA from both parasite species. Taken together, these findings indicate that although ineffective at combating infection during primary exposure, a cellular immune response is mounted in PBT as a potential rejoinder to future Cardicola exposure, particularly against C.\u00a0orientalis. Although future investigation into antibody effectiveness will be needed, this work provides valuable preliminary insight into host responsiveness to Cardicola infection as well as additional support for the need of anthelmintic treatment following primary parasite exposure during PBT culture.", "journal": "Fish & shellfish immunology", "date": "2013-10-29", "authors": ["MarkPolinski", "ShoShirakashi", "AndrewBridle", "BarbaraNowak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fsi.2013.10.008"}

DOX's clinical efficacy is greatly limited because of severe cardiotoxicity. To evaluate if DOX is genotoxic in the heart, ~7-week-old, male F344 rats were administered intravenously 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg bw DOX at 0, 24, 48, and 69 hr and the Comet assays in heart, liver, kidney, and testis and micronucleus (MN) assay in the peripheral blood (PB) erythrocytes using flow cytometry were conducted. Rats were euthanized at 72 hr and PB was removed for the MN assay and single cells were isolated from multiple tissues for the Comet assays. None of the doses of DOX induced a significant DNA damage in any of the tissues examined by the alkaline Comet assay. Contrastingly, the glycosylase enzymes-modified Comet assay showed a significant dose dependent increase in the oxidative DNA damage in the cardiac tissue (P \u2264 0.05). In the liver, only the top dose induced significant increase in the oxidative DNA damage (P \u2264 0.05). The histopathology showed no severe cardiotoxicity but non-neoplastic lesions were present in both untreated and treated samples. A severe toxicity likely occurred in the bone marrow because no viable reticulocytes could be screened for the MN assay.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes, such as imprinting control, circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation, immune responses and chromosome dynamics. Notably, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in disease etiology, although an association with VSD has not been reported. In the present study, we conducted an integrated analysis of dysregulated lncRNAs, focusing specifically on the identification and characterization of lncRNAs potentially involving in initiation of VSD. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of cardiac tissues from VSD-affected and normal hearts was performed using a second-generation lncRNA microarray, which covers the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts (29,241 lncRNAs and 30,215 coding transcripts). In total, 880 lncRNAs were upregulated and 628 were downregulated in VSD. Furthermore, our established filtering pipeline indicated an association of two lncRNAs, ENST00000513542 and RP11-473L15.2, with VSD. This dysregulation of the lncRNA profile provides a novel insight into the etiology of VSD and furthermore, illustrates the intricate relationship between coding and ncRNA transcripts in cardiac development.

Here we investigate if this pathway is also responsible for allograft fibrosis and if interference with the IL-13/TGF-\u03b21 interaction prevents allograft fibrosis.\nFVB or control DBA/1 donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into DBA/1 recipient mice and hearts were explanted at day 60 and 100 post-transplantation. Cardiac tissue was examined by Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, CD11b, IL-13, Fas ligand, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13, \u03b22-microglobulin, and Gremlin-1. Graft-infiltrating cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-13 and TGF-\u03b21 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the amount of collagen was quantified using a Sircol assay; IL-13R\u03b12 expression was detected by Western blotting. In some experiments IL-13/ TGF-\u03b21 signaling was blocked with specific IL-13R\u03b12 siRNA. Additionally, a PCR array of RNA isolated from the allografts was performed to analyze expression of multiple genes involved in fibrosis.\nBoth groups survived long-term (>100 days). The allogeneic grafts were infiltrated by significantly increased numbers of CD4+ (P <0.0001), CD8+ (P <0.0001), and CD11b+ cells (P = 0.0065) by day 100. Furthermore, elevated IL-13 levels (P = 0.0003) and numbers of infiltrating IL-13+ cells (P = 0.0037), together with an expression of IL-13R\u03b12, were detected only within allografts.

HO has recently emerged as a key factor modulating the immune response in diverse models of inflammatory diseases. In mice with two different genetic backgrounds, the pharmacologic inhibition of HO activity with zinc-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) induced enhanced myocarditis and reduced parasitaemia, which was accompanied by an amplified production of nitric oxide and increased influx of CD4(+), CD8(+) and IFN-\u03b3(+) cells to the myocardium in comparison with the control group.

For the most part, the human heart is capable of performing its duties without complications; however, throughout many decades of use, at some point this system encounters problems. Research into the heart's activities during healthy states and during adverse impacts that occur in disease states is necessary in order to strategize novel treatment options to ultimately prolong and improve patients' lives. Animal models are an important aspect of cardiac research where a variety of cardiac processes and therapeutic targets can be studied. However, there are differences between the heart of a human being and an animal and depending on the specific animal, these differences can become more pronounced and in certain cases limiting. There is no ideal animal model available for cardiac research, the use of each animal model is accompanied with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this review, we will discuss these advantages and disadvantages of commonly used laboratory animals including mouse, rat, rabbit, canine, swine, and sheep. Since the goal of cardiac research is to enhance our understanding of human health and disease and help improve clinical outcomes, we will also discuss the role of human cardiac tissue in cardiac research. This review will focus on the cardiac ventricular contractile and relaxation kinetics of humans and animal models in order to illustrate these differences.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2013-10-22", "authors": ["NimaMilani-Nejad", "Paul M LJanssen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.10.007"}

Here we report a simple approach for fabricating 3-dimensional (3D) gold nanoparticle (NP)-based fibrous scaffolds, for engineering functional cardiac tissues generating a strong contraction force. A polycaprolactone-gelatin mixture was electrospun to obtain fibrous scaffolds with an average fiber diameter of 250 nm. In a facile method, gold NPs were evaporated on the surface of the fibers, creating nanocomposites with a nominal gold thickness of 2, 4, and 14 nm. Compared to pristine scaffolds, cardiac cells seeded on the nano-gold scaffolds assembled into more elongated and aligned tissues. The gold NPs on the fibers were able to maintain the ratio of cardiomyocytes to fibroblasts in the culture, to encourage the growth of cardiomyocytes with significantly higher aspect ratio, and promote massive cardiac sarcomeric actinin expression. Finally, engineering cardiac tissues within gold NP-based scaffolds exhibited significantly higher contraction amplitudes and rates, as compared to scaffolds without gold. We envision that cardiac tissues engineered within these gold NP scaffolds can be used to improve the function of the infarcted heart.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

However, little is known about their combined effects on cardiac function. The aim of the present study was to observe the effects of a ketamine/xylazine (K/X) combination on the cardiac function of rats with severe scalds and compare them with those of avertin. Adult rats were randomly distributed into four groups: the KXB group (scalds anesthetized with K/X, n=10), the KXC group (sham scalds anesthetized with K/X, n=10), the AVB group (scalds anesthetized with avertin, n=10) and the AVC group (sham scalds anesthetized with avertin, n=10). Ketamine and xylazine were administered at 25 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, and avertin at 200 mg/kg before full-thickness scalds or sham scalds of 30% total body surface area (TBSA) were produced. Echocardiographic parameters were assessed following injury. The heart rate (HR) in the KXB group was fatally low during the study period. Fractional shortening (FS%) and ejection fraction (EF) in the KXB group were extremely low initially and remained low. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) were reduced in the burned rats. Serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were significantly higher in the KXB group than in the AVB group (1.66\u00b10.28 vs. 1.16\u00b10.34 ng/ml, P<0.01). The highest lung wet/dry weight ratio was observed in the KXB group. However, no evident heart tissue pathological changes were observed in these groups. The apoptotic index of myocardial cells and caspase 3 expression level were highest in the KXB group (P<0.01).

Healthy male Wistar rats were fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for four weeks, and then were injected with STZ twice (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Once DCM was confirmed, the rats were divided randomly into the following groups: DCM without treatment, CEPO treatment at different dosages (500, 1,000 or 2,000 IU/kg) or recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) treatment (1,000 IU/kg), for a four-week short intervention or an eight-week long intervention protocol. Healthy rats were used as normal controls. Venous blood samples were drawn for routine hematological examinations, and heart tissues were collected for histological analysis, as well as the determination of myocardial apoptosis and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. CEPO treatment had no significant effect on the erythrocyte or hemoglobin levels in the rats with DCM; however, it reduced myocardial cell apoptosis in the rats and protected the cellular ultrastructure. In addition, CEPO treatment inhibited caspase-3 and increased Bcl-xl protein expression (P<0.05). It also increased PI3K (p85) and Akt1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the hearts of the rats with DCM, with a dose-response relationship. An eight-week treatment using CEPO, in comparison with a four-week protocol, marginally increased PI3K (p85) and Akt1 expression, and did not demonstrate significant benefit.

{"title": "Proangiogenic microtemplated fibrin scaffolds containing aprotinin promote improved wound healing responses.", "abstract": "Survival of tissue engineered constructs after implantation depends heavily on induction of a vascular response in host tissue, promoting a quick anastomosis of the cellular graft. Additionally, implanted constructs typically induce fibrous capsule formation, effectively preventing graft integration with host tissue. Previously we described the development of a high density microtemplated fibrin scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering applications with tunable degradation and mechanical properties which promoted seeded cell survival and organization in vitro (Thomson et al., Tissue Eng Part A, 2013). Scaffold degradation in vitro was controllable by addition of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and/or the fibrin cross-linker Factor XIII (FXIII). The goal of this study was to assess host tissue responses to these fibrin scaffold formulations by determining effects on scaffold degradation, angiogenic responses, and fibrous capsule formation in a subcutaneous implant model. Aprotinin significantly decreased scaffold degradation over 2\u00a0weeks of implantation. A significant increase in capillary infiltration of aprotinin implants was found after 1 and 2\u00a0weeks, with a significantly greater amount of capillaries reaching the interior of aprotinin scaffolds. Interestingly, after 2\u00a0weeks the aprotinin scaffolds had a significantly thinner, yet apparently more cellular fibrous capsule than unmodified scaffolds. These results indicate aprotinin not only inhibits fibrin scaffold degradation, but also induces significant responses in the host tissue. These included an angiogenic response resulting in increased vascularization of the scaffold material over a relatively short period of time. In addition, aprotinin release from scaffolds may reduce fibrous capsule formation, which could help promote improved integration of cell-seeded scaffolds with host tissue.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2013-10-16", "authors": ["Kassandra SThomson", "Sarah KDupras", "Charles EMurry", "MartaScatena", "MichaelRegnier"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-013-9388-z"}
{"title": "Biomimetic materials design for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. In the absence of sufficient numbers of organs for heart transplant, alternate approaches for healing or replacing diseased heart tissue are under investigation. Designing biomimetic materials to support these approaches will be essential to their overall success. Strategies for cardiac tissue engineering include injection of cells, implantation of three-dimensional tissue constructs or patches, injection of acellular materials, and replacement of valves. To replicate physiological function and facilitate engraftment into native tissue, materials used in these approaches should have properties that mimic those of the natural cardiac environment. Multiple aspects of the cardiac microenvironment have been emulated using biomimetic materials including delivery of bioactive factors, presentation of cell-specific adhesion sites, design of surface topography to guide tissue alignment and dictate cell shape, modulation of mechanical stiffness and electrical conductivity, and fabrication of three-dimensional structures to guide tissue formation and function. Biomaterials can be engineered to assist in stem cell expansion and differentiation, to protect cells during injection and facilitate their retention and survival in vivo, and to provide mechanical support and guidance for engineered tissue formation. Numerous studies have investigated the use of biomimetic materials for cardiac regeneration.

Our aims were to investigate the effect of IH on heart tissue using an IH-exposed rat model and to explore the potential mechanisms involved in the occurrence of cardiac damage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to IH and intermittent normoxia as control and sacrificed after 2 or 4 weeks. IH for 4 weeks caused elevation in serum malondialdehyde and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 and reduction in serum adiponectin levels. In contrast, cardiac oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers were suppressed while cardiac adiponectin and cholesterol levels were elevated after IH exposure for 4 weeks. In parallel, there was an increase in apoptosis in the heart of IH-exposed rats, demonstrated by elevations of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein and TUNEL staining. Cardiac damage was further evident with decreased arterial vessel and capillary densities, increased cardiac fibrosis, and the loss of troponin I. Our data demonstrated that IH exposure paradoxically caused systemic oxidative and inflammatory responses and cardioprotective responses, i.e., anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. Despite such a local compensatory protective mechanism, cardiac damage was observed that might be due to IH-induced cholesterol accumulation in the heart and caspase-dependent apoptosis.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["QianHan", "Sze CYeung", "Mary S MIp", "Judith C WMak"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-013-0294-z"}

Transesophageal echocardiography has thus gained an important role in many catheterization laboratories that perform percutaneous structural heart disease interventions.

The task of coronary arteries is to distribute blood to the heart tissue and any blockage in them can cause the tissue to absorb less oxygen and nutrients than needed (ischaemia disease). This imbalance will continue until the first cell is destroyed (myocardial infarction). Simulating the myocardial infarction in the laboratory rats, this study tries to determine the extent of tissue damage through the electrocardiogram (ECG) and atrial blood pressure (ABP) synchronic signals. The signals of 50 wistar rats with a weight range of 200-300 g were recorded at 30 min in the normal case and 30 min in the ischaemia and myocardial infarction (MI) case (the artificial complete blockage was in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)). For a different injury in the rats' heart, the vasopressin (AVP) with different doses was injected to 40 rats. After that the images of the heart sections and the data were extracted, the 50-dimensional feature vector was generated by using the wavelet packet transform (WPT) on the ECG and ABP signals and also by obtaining the entropy of the wavelet coefficients. The extent of tissue damage on the images of the heart tissue was extracted by using the image processing method. Finally, the amount of the damaged tissue was estimated by four artificial neural networks (ANN) (with different structures) with an averaging criterion.

Aberrant glycosylation is reported to associate with diseases such as cancers, human immunodeficiency virus, and immune disorders. It is considerably important to study protein glycosylation and the associated glycans for diagnostics and disease prognostics. Unlike other protein modifications, glycans attached to proteins are enormously complex. Therefore, the comprehensive analysis of glycans from biological or clinical samples is an unmet technical challenge. Development of the high-throughput method will facilitate the glycomics analysis. In this study, we developed a novel method for the high-throughput analysis of N-glycans from glycoproteins using glycoprotein immobilization for glycan extraction (GIG) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) in an integrated microfluidic platform (chipLC). The separated glycans were then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Briefly, proteins were first immobilized on a solid support. Glycans on immobilized glycoproteins were modified on solid phase to increase the detection and structure analysis. N-Glycans were then enzymatically released and subsequentially separated by porous graphitized carbon particles packed in the same device. By applying the GIG-chipLC for glycomic analysis of human sera, we identified N-glycans with 148 distinct N-glycan masses. The platform was used to analyze N-glycans from mouse heart tissue and serum. The extracted N-glycans from tissues indicated that unique unsialylated N-glycans were detected in tissues that were missing from the proximal or distal serum, whereas common N-glycans from tissues and serum have mature and sialylated structures.

{"title": "A novel approach for deriving global activation maps from non-averaged cardiac optical signals.", "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are often characterized by non-repetitive complex activation sequences. The properties of electrical activity in cardiac tissue, such as activation time (AT), can be accurately determined using optical imaging of electrical signals using voltage-sensitive dyes. The electrical AT of optical action potentials is known to accurately correlate with the time of the maximal derivative (dF/dt(max)) of the upstroke of ensemble averaged optical signals. The sensitivity of dF/dt(max) to noise is therefore problematic for mapping AT from nonrepetitive activity. Here we experimentally evaluated a novel method to determine activation times (AT) from non-averaged epicardial optical signals. The method depends upon the time delays of activation between adjacent pixels developing a global AT map, as opposed to measuring local AT from each pixel independently based on dF/dt(max). ATs from dF/dt(max) and global AT maps of non-ensemble averaged signals were correlated with averaged signals. Global ATs improved linear correlation coefficients and accuracy of AT patterns. Furthermore, global AT maps were significantly more robust at reproducing AT maps between consecutive stable beats. The proposed method of global AT mapping will potentially enable accurate mapping of non-repetitive propagation during arrhythmias.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Stochastic pacing effect on cardiac alternans--simulation study of a 2D human ventricular tissue.", "abstract": "The physiological heart rate is not deterministic but rather varies in time; those variations are termed heart rate variability (HRV). It is well known that low HRV is often seen in patients prone to arrhythmias. The ability of HRV to predict arrhythmia events is traditionally attributed to an impaired balance between the autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. However, there is no concrete model that directly relates low HRV to the electrical conduction in the cardiac tissue and to arrhythmogenic dynamic properties. We simulated stochastic cardiac pacing with Gaussian distribution using 2D human ventricular tissue model. Conduction stabilization was obtained with stochastic pacing owing to reduced propensity of the appearance of action potential duration (APD) discordant alternans and reduced APD spatial heterogeneity.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Effects of the hydrostatic pressure in in vitro beating cardiac syncytia in terms of kinematics (kinetic energy and beat frequency) and syncytia geometrical-functional classification.", "abstract": "Many important observations and discoveries in heart physiology have been made possible using the isolated heart method of Langendorff, e.g. the discovery of the very famous Frank-Starling law of the heart. Nevertheless, the Langendorff's method has some limitations and disadvantages such as the probability of preconditioning and a high oxidative stress, leading to the deterioration of the contractile function. To avoid the preceding drawbacks associated to the use of a whole heart, we have alternatively used beating mouse cardiac syncytia cultured in vitro in order to assess the ergotropic and chronotropic effects of both increasing and decreasing hydrostatic pressures. To achieve the preceding aim, we have developed a method based on image processing analysis to evaluate the kinematics of that pressure-loaded beating syncytia starting from the video registration of their contraction movement. We have verified the Frank-Starling law of the heart in in vitro beating cardiac syncytia and we have obtained their geometrical-functional classification. The present method could be used in in vitro studies of beating cardiac patches, as alternative to the Langendorff's heart in biochemical, pharmacological, and physiology studies, and, especially, when the Langendorff's technique is inapplicable. Furthermore, the method could help, in heart tissue engineering and bioartificial heart researches, to \"engineer the heart piece by piece\".", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

However, culture conditions, by which CSCs are expanded while maintaining their therapeutic potential, have not been optimized. We hypothesized that the plating cell-density would affect proliferation activity, differentiation and therapeutic potential of CSCs through the Notch signaling pathway.\nHuman CSCs were plated at 4 different densities. The population doubling time, C-KIT positivity, and dexamethasone-induced multidifferentiation potential were examined in vitro. The therapeutic potential of CSCs was assessed by transplanting them into a rat acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model. The low plating density (340cells/cm(2)) maintained the multidifferentiation potential with greater proliferation activity and C-KIT positivity in vitro. On the other hand, the high plating density (5,500cells/cm(2)) induced autonomous differentiation into endothelial cells by activating Notch signaling in vitro. CSCs cultured at low or high density with Notch signal inhibitor showed significantly greater therapeutic potential in vivo compared with those cultured at high density.\nCSCs cultured with reduced Notch signaling showed better cardiomyogenic differentiation and therapeutic potentials in a rat AMI model.

{"title": "Generation of bioartificial heart tissue by combining a three-dimensional gel-based cardiac construct with decellularized small intestinal submucosa.", "abstract": "The in vitro generation of a bioartificial cardiac construct (CC) represents a promising tool for the repair of ischemic heart tissue. Several approaches to engineer cardiac tissue in vitro have been conducted. The main drawback of these studies is the insufficient size of the resulting construct for clinical applications. The focus of this study was the generation of an artificial three-dimensional (3D), contractile, and suturable myocardial patch by combining a gel-based CC with decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), thereby engineering an artificial tissue of 11\u2009cm\u00b2 in size. The alignment and morphology of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs) in SIS-CC complexes were investigated as well as the re-organization of primary endothelial cells which were co-isolated in the rCM preparation. The ability of a rat heart endothelial cell line (RHE-A) to re-cellularize pre-existing vessel structures within the SIS or a biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) was determined. SIS-CC contracted spontaneously, uniformly, and rhythmically with an average rate of 200 beats/min in contrast to undirected contractions observed in CC without SIS support. rCM exhibited an elongated morphology with well-defined sarcomeric structures oriented along the longitudinal axis in the SIS-CC, whereas round-shaped and random-arranged rCM were observed in CC. Electric coupling of rCM was demonstrated by microelectrode array measurements. A dense network of CD31\u207a/eNOS\u207a cells was detected as permeating the whole construct. Superficial supplementation of RHE-A cells to SIS-CC led to the migration of these cells through the CC, resulting in the re-population of pre-existing vessel structures within the decelluarized SIS. By infusion of RHE-A cells into the BioVaM venous and arterial pedicles, a re-population of the BioVaM vessel bed as well as distribution of RHE-A cells throughout the CC was achieved. Rat endothelial cells within the CC were in contact with RHE-A cells.

Heart diseases are the main problem in humans worldwide, resulting very often in death of patients. Consequently, investigators sought methods which could improve myocardial function in patients with cardiac failure. Stem cells therapy belongs to one of the highly promising and the most realistic methods of treating myocardial infarction. Despite the fact that many cell types were transplanted into damaged myocardium, autologous skeletal myoblasts seem to be the most encouraging cell source for myocardial repair due to their myogenic and contractile phenotype, biochemical and functional similarities to cardiac cells, high proliferative capacity in vitro and resistance to ischemia. Moreover, engrafted myoblasts could repopulate post-infarction scar and improve cardiac function. Unfortunately, transplanted SMs do not functionally or electrically integrate with the host myocardium, which could also cause ventricular arrhythmias, therefore, the use of these cells still remains a subject of intensive studies aiming at improvement of this therapeutic method.

New translational therapeutic approaches explore cardiomyogenic differentiation of various types of stem cells in combination with tissue-engineered scaffolds. In this study we fabricated PHBHV/gelatin constructs mimicking myocardial structural properties. Chemical structure and molecular interaction between material components induced specific properties to the substrate in terms of hydrophilicity degree, porosity and mechanical characteristics. Viability and proliferation assays demonstrated that these constructs allow adhesion and growth of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cardiac resident non myocytic cells (NMCs). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that stem cells cultured on these constructs adopt a distribution mimicking the three-dimensional cell alignment of myocardium. qPCR and immunofluorescence analyses showed the ability of this construct to direct initial MSC and NMC lineage specification towards cardiomyogenesis: both MSCs and NMCs showed the expression of the cardiac transcription factor GATA-4, fundamental for early cardiac commitment. Moreover NMCs also acquired the expression of the cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5 and TBX5 and produced sarcomeric proteins.

Oxygenation is known to promote cardiac survival through activation of NOS3 gene. We hypothesized a dual role for p53, which, depending on oxygenation, can elicit apoptotic death signals or NOS3-mediated survival signals in the infarct heart. p53 exhibited a differential DNA-binding, namely, BAX-p53RE in the infarct heart or NOS3-p53RE in the oxygenated heart, which was regulated by oxygen-induced, post-translational modification of p53. In the infarct heart, p53 was heavily acetylated at Lys(118) residue, which was exclusively reversed in the oxygenated heart, apparently regulated by oxygen-dependent expression of TIP60. The inhibition of Lys(118) acetylation promoted the generation of NOS3-promoting prosurvival form of p53. Thus, oxygenation switches p53-DNA interaction by regulating p53 core-domain acetylation, promoting a prosurvival transcription activity of p53.

We hypothesized that mitochondrial function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) would reflect cellular respiration in other organs during hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.\nUsing a fixed-pressure HS model, Long-Evans rats were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg. When blood pressure could no longer be sustained without intermittent fluid infusion (decompensated HS), lactated Ringer's solution was incrementally infused to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 40 mmHg until 40% of the shed blood volume was returned (severe HS).

{"title": "Hexokinase-mitochondrial interactions regulate glucose metabolism differentially in adult and neonatal cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "In mammalian tumor cell lines, localization of hexokinase (HK) isoforms to the cytoplasm or mitochondria has been shown to control their anabolic (glycogen synthesis) and catabolic (glycolysis) activities. In this study, we examined whether HK isoform differences could explain the markedly different metabolic profiles between normal adult and neonatal cardiac tissue. We used a set of novel genetically encoded optical imaging tools to track, in real-time in isolated adult (ARVM) and neonatal (NRVM) rat ventricular myocytes, the subcellular distributions of HKI and HKII, and the functional consequences on glucose utilization. We show that HKII, the predominant isoform in ARVM, dynamically translocates from mitochondria and cytoplasm in response to removal of extracellular glucose or addition of iodoacetate (IAA). In contrast, HKI, the predominant isoform in NRVM, is only bound to mitochondria and is not displaced by the above interventions. In ARVM, overexpression of HKI, but not HKII, increased glycolytic activity. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NVRM), knockdown of HKI, but not HKII, decreased glycolytic activity. In conclusion, differential interactions of HKI and HKII with mitochondria underlie the different metabolic profiles of ARVM and NRVM, accounting for the markedly increased glycolytic activity of NRVM.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["GuillaumeCalmettes", "Scott AJohn", "James NWeiss", "BernardRibalet"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.201310968\n10.1016/S0969-2126(98)00006-9\n10.1016/0003-9861(84)90554-X\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.239376\n10.1074/jbc.M706334200\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.4.578\n10.1126/science.253.5018.390\n10.1074/jbc.M301333200\n10.1038/onc.2008.114\n10.1074/jbc.M808698200\n10.1172/JCI114085\n10.1101/gad.889901\n10.1007/s00424-007-0395-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017674\n10.1002/jcb.21634\n10.1128/MCB.24.2.730-740.2004\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402285\n10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00027.x\n10.1126/science.272.5259.263\n10.1161/JAHA.112.005645\n10.1007/s10863-008-9148-8\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1925\n10.4161/cc.4.5.1678\n10.1161/01.RES.68.1.114\n10.1172/JCI116076\n10.1006/abbi.1998.1043\n10.1074/jbc.M506943200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.244962\n10.1007/s10863-009-9207-9\n10.1006/abbi.1997.0241\n10.1021/ja202902d\n10.1677/joe.1.06381\n10.1016/0003-9861(90)90545-A\n10.1242/jeb.00241\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223115\n10.1038/nbt0997-871"}

We aimed to test the hypothesis that hMSCs from the heart and epicardial fat would be better cells for infarct repair.\nWe isolated and grew hMSCs from patients with ischemic heart disease from 4 locations: epicardial fat, pericardial fat, subcutaneous fat, and the right atrium. Significantly, hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat secreted the highest amounts of trophic and inflammatory cytokines, while hMSCs from pericardial and subcutaneous fat secreted the lowest. Relative expression of inflammation- and fibrosis-related genes was considerably higher in hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat than in subcutaneous fat hMSCs. To determine the functional effects of hMSCs, we allocated rats to hMSC transplantation 7 days after myocardial infarction. Atrial hMSCs induced greatest infarct vascularization as well as highest inflammation score 27 days after transplantation. Surprisingly, cardiac dysfunction was worst after transplantation of hMSCs from atrium and epicardial fat and minimal after transplantation of hMSCs from subcutaneous fat. These findings were confirmed by using hMSC transplantation in immunocompromised mice after myocardial infarction. Notably, there was a correlation between tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 secretion from hMSCs and posttransplantation left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.\nBecause of their proinflammatory properties, hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat of cardiac patients could impair heart function after myocardial infarction.

Female Wistar rats received low or control zinc diets from the beginning of pregnancy up to offspring weaning. After being weaned, offspring were fed either a low or control zinc diet until 81 days. Systolic blood pressure was measured. Echocardiographic and electrocardiographic examinations, morphological experiments, and apoptosis by TUNEL assay were performed in the left ventricle. In the early stages, zinc-deficient male and female offspring showed an increase in cardiomyocyte diameter, probably associated with an increase in cardiac apoptotic cells, but smaller myocyte diameters in adulthood. In adult males, this nutritional injury induced decreased contractility and dilatation of the left ventricle, not allowing the heart to compensate the higher levels of blood pressure, and hypertrophic remodeling of coronary arteries associated with increased blood pressure. Adequate zinc intake during postweaning life did not overcome blood pressure levels but reversed some of the detrimental effects of earlier zinc deficiency in cardiac morphology and function. Females were less sensitive to this deficiency, exhibiting normal levels of blood pressure and no structural or functional heart alterations in adult life. The present study demonstrates that the effects of zinc deficiency on blood pressure, cardiac morphology, and function differ between sexes, with males more predisposed to develop cardiovascular diseases in adulthood.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Now, the protection and underlying mechanisms of SLD against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are still unknown. In the present study, we revealed both antioxidative mechanism and Bcl2-dependent survival signaling involved in SLD's protection. We observed that DOX exposure induced mortality elevation, body weight loss, and cardiac dysfunction in mice, increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, but decreased cell viability and size in cardiac tissues and cultured H9c2 cells, respectively, which were effectively antagonized by SLD supplement. We further observed that SLD significantly reduced the intercellular oxidative stress level, partly by inhibiting NOX1 expression and augmenting the expression and activities of the endogenous antioxidative enzymes, catalase, and manganese superoxide dismutase. In addition, SLD treatment upregulated the antiapoptotic Bcl2 and downregulated the proapoptotic Bax and inhibited a downstream pathway of Bcl2/Bax and caspase-3 activity.

Scientists are trying to generate cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo to repair damaged heart tissue. Pluripotent reprogramming brings an alternative source of embryonic-like stem cells, and the possibility of regenerating mammalian tissues by first reverting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells, followed by redifferentiating these cells into cardiomyocytes. More recently, lineage reprogramming of fibroblasts directly into functional cardiomyocytes has been reported. The procedure does not involve reverting cells back to a pluripotent stage, and, thus, would presumably reduce tumorigenic potential. Interestingly, lineage reprogramming could be used for in situ conversion of cell fate.

{"title": "GAPDH: the missing link between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation?", "abstract": "The main function of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is to produce cellular energy in the form of ATP. In the present paper we propose a link between both of these energy-regulatory processes in the form of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and CytOx (cytochrome c oxidase). GAPDH is the sixth enzyme of glycolysis, whereas CytOx is the fourth complex of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. In MS analysis, GAPDH was found to be associated with a BN-PAGE (blue native PAGE)-isolated complex of CytOx from bovine heart tissue homogenates. Both GAPDH and CytOx are highly regulated under normal energy metabolic conditions, but both of these enzymes are highly deregulated in the presence of oxidative stress. The interaction of GAPDH with CytOx could be the point of interest as it has already been shown that GAPDH protein damage results in a marked decrease in cellular ATP levels. On the other hand, decreasing the ATP/ADP ratio may ultimately result in switching off the allosteric ATP inhibition of CytOx leading to increased ROS (reactive oxygen species), cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, we have previously reported that allosteric ATP inhibition of CytOx is responsible for keeping the membrane potential at low healthy values, thus avoiding the production of ROS and this allosteric ATP inhibition is switched on at a high ATP/ADP ratio. So, in the present paper, we propose a scheme that could prove to be a link between these two enzymes and their role in the prevalence of diseases.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["RabiaRamzan", "PetraWeber", "UweLinne", "SebastianVogt"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20130067"}

{"title": "Shadow enhancers flanking the HoxB cluster direct dynamic Hox expression in early heart and endoderm development.", "abstract": "The products of Hox genes function in assigning positional identity along the anterior-posterior body axis during animal development. In mouse embryos, Hox genes located at the 3' end of HoxA and HoxB complexes are expressed in nested patterns in the progenitors of the secondary heart field during early cardiogenesis and the combined activities of both of these clusters are required for proper looping of the heart. Using Hox bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), transposon reporters, and transgenic analyses in mice, we present the identification of several novel enhancers flanking the HoxB complex which can work over a long range to mediate dynamic reporter expression in the endoderm and embryonic heart during development. These enhancers respond to exogenously added retinoic acid and we have identified two retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) within these control modules that play a role in potentiating their regulatory activity. Deletion analysis in HoxB BAC reporters reveals that these control modules, spread throughout the flanking intergenic region, have regulatory activities that overlap with other local enhancers. This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Regulatory analysis of the HoxA complex reveals that it also has enhancers in the 3' flanking region which contain RAREs and have the potential to modulate expression in endoderm and heart tissues. Together, the similarities in their location, enhancer output, and dependence on retinoid signaling suggest that a conserved cis-regulatory cassette located in the 3' proximal regions adjacent to the HoxA and HoxB complexes evolved to modulate Hox gene expression during mammalian cardiac and endoderm development. This suggests a common regulatory mechanism, whereby the conserved control modules act over a long range on multiple Hox genes to generate nested patterns of HoxA and HoxB expression during cardiogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2013-09-24", "authors": ["ChristofNolte", "TimJinks", "XinghaoWang", "Mar\u00eda TeresaMartinez Pastor", "RobbKrumlauf"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.09.016"}
{"title": "Impact of weightlessness on cardiac shape and left ventricular stress/strain distributions.", "abstract": "In this paper, a finite element model of the heart is developed to investigate the impact of different gravitational loadings of Earth, Mars, Moon, and microgravity on the cardiac shape and strain/stress distributions in the left ventricle. The finite element model is based on realistic 3D heart geometry, detailed fiber/sheet micro-architecture, and a validated orthotropic cardiac tissue model and constitutive relationship that capture the passive behavior of the heart at end-diastole. The model predicts the trend and magnitude of cardiac shape change at different gravitational levels with great fidelity in comparison to recent cardiac sphericity measurements performed during simulated reduced-gravity parabolic flight experiments. Moreover, the numerical predictions indicate that although the left ventricular strain distributions remain relatively unaltered across the gravitational fields and the strain extrema values occur at the same relative locations, their values change noticeably with decreasing gravity. As for the stress, however, both the magnitude and location of the extrema change with a decrease in the gravitational field. Consequently, tension regions of the heart on Earth can change into compression regions in space.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2013-09-21", "authors": ["IlanaIskovitz", "MohammadKassemi", "James DThomas"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4025464"}

This situation predisposes nonhuman primate colonies exposed to outdoor housing to infection from ingestion or bite of triatomid insects. Using a T. cruzi-specific real-time PCR and Trypanosome spp.-specific ELISA, we revealed a prevalence rate of 8.5% in a colony of outdoor-housed cynomolgus macaques. By using a discriminating kinetoplastid minicircle PCR, we eliminated the possibility of mixed prevalence with nonpathogenic trypanosomes and showed the ELISA results were specific for T. cruzi. In this study, we found an inverse relationship between antibody titers and circulating parasite load. Also, 23% of T. cruzi IgG ELISA-positive macaques were negative by real-time PCR. Furthermore, in a subset of infected macaques, cardiac tissue was infiltrated by inflammatory mononuclear cells and contained T. cruzi genomic and kinetoplast DNA despite lacking microscopic evidence of discrete parasite stages. In addition, 19% of the infected macaques had titers for cardiac troponin I autoantibody, which could contribute to autoimmune myocarditis or interfere with circulating troponin I measurements. These findings indicate the possibility of T. cruzi to interfere with the assessment of cardiac safety signals in preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies and the necessity for prestudy screening for T. cruzi in outdoor-housed nonhuman primates from endemic areas.", "journal": "Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS", "date": "2013-09-18", "authors": ["HarshanPisharath", "Chih-LingZao", "JohnKreeger", "SusanPortugal", "ThomasKawabe", "TareaBurton", "LisaTomaeck", "AhmedShoieb", "Brandy MorenkoCampbell", "JudyFranco"], "doi": null}

HER2 positivity, as defined by IHC or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, remains an imprecise predictor of patient response to HER2-targeted therapies. Challenges to correct HER2 assessment and patient stratification include intratumoral heterogeneity, lack of quantitative and/or objective assays, and differences between measuring HER2 amplification at the protein versus gene level. We developed a novel immunofluorescence method for quantitation of HER2 protein expression at the single-cell level on FFPE patient samples. Our assay uses automated image analysis to identify and classify tumor versus non-tumor cells, as well as quantitate the HER2 staining for each tumor cell. The HER2 staining level is converted to HER2 protein expression using a standard cell pellet array stained in parallel with the tissue sample. This approach allows assessment of HER2 expression and heterogeneity within a tissue section at the single-cell level. By using this assay, we identified distinct subgroups of HER2 heterogeneity within traditional definitions of HER2 positivity in both breast and gastric cancers. Quantitative assessment of intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity may offer an opportunity to improve the identification of patients likely to respond to HER2-targeted therapies.

However, the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in IR is still controversial. The present study was designed to explore the possible involvement of nNOS in cardiac IR. nNOS-/- knockout (KO) and wild type C57 (WT) mice were subjected to 45 min of ischemia by left descending branch of coronary artery ligation followed by 3 h reperfusion, which plasma was collected for creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurements, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and measurements of activities of caspase-3, -8, -9, phospho-p38, -ERK, -JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospho-nNOS, phospho-eNOS and iNOS. IR induced cardiac tissue apoptosis by increases of TUNEL staining and activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9, accompanied with increase of CK and LDH concentration and phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK MAPK and phospho-nNOS, phospho-eNOS and iNOS in both mouse strains. However, IR induced increases of TUNEL staining and activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and CK and LDH concentrations and activation of p38 MAPK were markedly lower in KO mice compared with WT mice.

{"title": "Disruption of pro-oxidant and antioxidant systems with elevated expression of the ubiquitin proteosome system in the cachectic heart muscle of nude mice.", "abstract": "Current research into the mechanisms of organ atrophy associated with cancer cachexia have centred on the loss of skeletal muscle, as it is one of the most profound physical changes of the disease. However, many patients with cancer cachexia also experience significant atrophy of the heart. The mechanisms causing cardiac tissue wastage in cancer cachexia are largely unknown. However, it is believed to involve a number of molecular interactions between the tumour and host. Increased levels of oxidative stress have been found in cancer cachectic skeletal muscle and has been linked to the activation of the ubiquitin proteosome system (UPS). The aim of the current study was to examine the role of oxidative stress and the UPS in the hearts of mice with cancer cachexia.\nOxidative damage to DNA (8-OH-2dG), mRNA levels of the ROS-producing enzymes NADPH oxidase (NOX), and xanthine oxidase (XDH), the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and key components of the UPS was measured in the heart of mice with cancer cachexia. Protein expression levels of NOX enzyme subunits and SOD enzyme activity was also measured in the same heart samples.\n8-OH-2dG levels were 1.5-fold higher in the heart of mice with cancer cachexia, and this was associated with a 1.7-fold lower level of NOX2 mRNA and twofold higher XDH mRNA in the same hearts. Cancer cachexia was also associated with a 1.5-fold lower level of SOD activity in the heart. Accompanying these pro- and antioxidant differences was a significantly higher level of mRNA for the key UPS elements MURF-1 (4.3=fold) and MAFbx (3.8-fold) in the hearts of mice with cancer cachexia.\nThe current study demonstrated that cardiac atrophy of cachectic mice is associated with oxidative damage to DNA in the myocardium. The higher levels of XDH mRNA in cachectic hearts suggest that xanthine oxidase may have an important role to play in producing oxidative stress. It appears that the combination of higher XDH expression and lower SOD enzyme activity are key contributors to oxidative stress and cardiac tissue damage in cancer-induced cardiac atrophy. Oxidative stress in the myocardium as with skeletal muscle may also induce increased expression of the E3 ligases MURF-1 and MAFbx as seen in this study.", "journal": "Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle", "date": "2013-09-14", "authors": ["E C AHinch", "M JSullivan-Gunn", "V CVaughan", "M AMcGlynn", "Paul ALewandowski"], "doi": "10.1007/s13539-013-0116-8\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3145\n10.1054/bjoc.2001.1696\n10.1038/bjc.1997.433\n10.1038/379739a0\n10.1016/j.febslet.2005.02.017\n10.1089/ars.2009.2818\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6602780\n10.1126/science.1065874\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.10.026\n10.1016/j.canlet.2004.12.005\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfp042\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2007.11.001\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000041431.57222.AF\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.163\n10.1016/S0304-3835(02)00006-X\n10.1164/rccm.200407-887OC\n10.1007/s13539-011-0037-3\n10.1161/01.RES.85.5.437\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.04.003\n10.1007/s00380-010-0006-3\n10.3109/10641969509033636\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.07.015\n10.1073/pnas.0404341102"}

{"title": "Reduced vesicular storage of catecholamines causes progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus.", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disease. Pathologically, PD is characterized by Lewy body deposition and subsequent death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. PD also consistently features degeneration of the locus ceruleus, the main source of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. We have previously reported a mouse model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration based on reduced expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2 LO). To determine if reduced vesicular storage can also cause noradrenergic degeneration, we examined indices of damage to the catecholaminergic systems in brain and cardiac tissue of VMAT2 LO mice. At two months of age, neurochemical analyses revealed substantial reductions in striatal dopamine (94%), cortical dopamine (57%) and norepinephrine (54%), as well as cardiac norepinephrine (97%). These losses were accompanied by increased conversion of dopamine and norepinephrine to their deaminated metabolites. VMAT2 LO mice exhibited loss of noradrenergic innervation in the cortex, as determined by norepinephrine transporter immunoreactivity and (3)H-nisoxetine binding. Using unbiased stereological techniques, we observed progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus that preceded degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, the ventral tegmental area, which is spared in human PD, remained unaffected. The coordinate loss of dopamine and norepinephrine neurons in VMAT2 LO mice parallels the pattern of neurodegeneration that occurs in human PD, and demonstrates that insufficient catecholamine storage can cause spontaneous degeneration in susceptible neurons, underscoring cytosolic catecholamine catabolism as a determinant of neuronal susceptibility in PD.

Bisulfite sequencing studies have identified 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) DNA methylation as one of the epigenetic changes that may be involved in this process. However, analysis of samples by bisulfite sequencing is a time-consuming procedure. In addition, it has recently been shown that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) is also present in mammalian DNA, and bisulfite sequencing cannot distinguish between 5 hmC and 5 mC.\nWe have developed specific MethylScreen restriction enzyme digestion and qPCR-based protocols to more rapidly quantify DNA methylation at four CpG sites in the FXN upstream GAA region. Increased DNA methylation was confirmed at all four CpG sites in both FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues. We have also analysed the DNA methylation status in FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues using an approach that enables distinction between 5 hmC and 5 mC. Our analysis reveals that the majority of DNA methylation in both FRDA and unaffected tissues actually comprises 5 hmC rather than 5 mC. We have also identified decreased occupancy of the chromatin insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) at the FXN 5' UTR region in the same FRDA cerebellum tissues.\nIncreased DNA methylation at the FXN upstream GAA region, primarily 5 hmC rather than 5 mC, and decreased CTCF occupancy at the FXN 5' UTR are associated with FRDA disease-relevant human tissues.

Our 2D studies use (a) both homogeneous and inhomogeneous distributions of fibroblasts, (b) various ranges for parameters such as [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], and (c) intercellular couplings that can be zero-sided, one-sided, and two-sided connections of fibroblasts with myocytes. We show, in particular, that the plane-wave conduction velocity [Formula: see text] decreases as a function of [Formula: see text], for zero-sided and one-sided couplings; however, for two-sided coupling, [Formula: see text] decreases initially and then increases as a function of [Formula: see text], and, eventually, we observe that conduction failure occurs for low values of [Formula: see text]. In our homogeneous studies, we find that the rotation speed and stability of a spiral wave can be controlled either by controlling [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text]. Our studies with fibroblast inhomogeneities show that a spiral wave can get anchored to a local fibroblast inhomogeneity. We also study the efficacy of a low-amplitude control scheme, which has been suggested for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models for cardiac tissue, in our MF model both with and without heterogeneities.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-09-12", "authors": ["Alok RanjanNayak", "T KShajahan", "A VPanfilov", "RahulPandit"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0072950"}

CYP2J2 also contributes to drug metabolism and is responsible for the intestinal clearance of ebastine. However, the interaction between arachidonic acid metabolism and drug metabolism in cardiac tissue, the main expression site of CYP2J2, has not been examined. Here we investigate an adult-derived human primary cardiac cell line as a suitable model to study metabolic drug interactions (inhibition and induction) of CYP2J2 in cardiac tissue. The primary human cardiomyocyte cell line demonstrated similar mRNA-expression profiles of P450 enzymes to adult human ventricular tissue. CYP2J2 was the dominant isozyme with minor contributions from CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. Both terfenadine and astemizole oxidation were observed in this cell line, whereas midazolam was not metabolized suggesting lack of CYP3A activity. Compared with recombinant CYP2J2, terfenadine was hydroxylated in cardiomyocytes at a similar K(m) value of 1.5 \u03bcM. The V(max) of terfenadine hydroxylation in recombinant enzyme was found to be 29.4 pmol/pmol P450 per minute and in the cells 6.0 pmol/pmol P450 per minute. CYP2J2 activity in the cell line was inhibited by danazol, astemizole, and ketoconazole in submicromolar range, but also by xenobiotics known to cause cardiac adverse effects. Of the 14 compounds tested for CYP2J2 induction, only rosiglitazone increased mRNA expression, by 1.8-fold.

{"title": "Effects of electromagnetic field exposure on the heart: a systematic review.", "abstract": "The use of electrical devices has gradually increased throughout the last century, and scientists have suggested that electromagnetic fields (EMF) generated by such devices may have harmful effects on living creatures. This work represents a systematic review of collective scholarly literature examining the effects of EMFs on the heart. Although most works describing effects of EMF exposure have been carried out using city electric frequencies (50-60 Hz), a consensus has not been reached about whether long- or short-term exposure to 50-60 Hz EMF negatively affects the heart. Studies have indicated that EMFs produced at cell-phone frequencies cause no-effect on the heart. Differences between results of studies may be due to a compensatory response developed by the body over time. At greater EMF strengths or shorter exposures, the ability of the body to develop compensation mechanisms is reduced and the potential for heart-related effects increases. It is noteworthy that diseases of heart tissues such as myocardial ischemia can also be successfully treated using EMF. Despite the substantial volume of data that has been collected on heart-related effects of EMFs, additional studies are needed at the cellular and molecular level to fully clarify the subject. Until the effects of EMF on heart tissue are more fully explored, electronic devices generating EMFs should be approached with caution.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2013-09-12", "authors": ["OnurElmas"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233713498444"}

Thus study of cardiomyocyte morphology and function during early stages of diabetes using modern analytical methods is of critical importance. Therefore, using confocal microscopy, we determined metric parameters, volumes and contractility, with calcium transients in isolated left-ventricular myocytes at one week after induction of diabetes in rats. Myocyte volume analysis from 3D confocal scans was performed using an automated contour detection algorithm that took the actual shape of the myocytes into account. We showed a significant reduction in myocyte volume in diabetic animals. We also showed a significant reduction in length and width but not in thickness of the myocytes, which suggests disproportional reorganization of the structure of the heart tissue during short-term diabetes. From a functional point of view, we observed a significant decrease in cell shortening at a stimulation frequency of 0.5 Hz. This was accompanied by a decrease in calcium transient amplitude.

An MS-based strategy utilizing an inexpensive acetone-based peptide-labeling technique known as reductive alkylation by acetone (RABA) for quantitative phosphoproteomics was explored to evaluate its capacity. Because the chemistry for RABA labeling for phosphorylation profiling had not been previously reported, it was first validated using a standard phosphoprotein and identical phosphoproteomes from cardiac tissue extracts. A workflow was then utilized to compare cardiac tissue phosphoproteomes from mouse hearts not expressing FGF2 versus hearts expressing low-molecular-weight fibroblast growth factor-2 (LMW FGF2) to relate low-molecular-weight fibroblast growth factor-2 (LMW FGF2)-mediated cardioprotective phenomena induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury of hearts, with downstream phosphorylation changes in LMW FGF2 signaling cascades. Statistically significant phosphorylation changes were identified at 14 different sites on 10 distinct proteins, including some with mechanisms already established for LMW FGF2-mediated cardioprotective signaling (e.g., connexin-43), some with new details linking LMW FGF2 to the cardioprotective mechanisms (e.g., cardiac myosin binding protein C or cMyBPC), and also several new downstream effectors not previously recognized for cardio-protective signaling by LMW FGF2. Additionally, one of the phosphopeptides, cMyBPC/pSer-282, identified was further verified with site-specific quantification using an SRM (selected reaction monitoring)-based approach that also relies on isotope labeling of a synthetic phosphopeptide with deuterated acetone as an internal standard.

This limitation motivates the search for small, inexpensive molecules that would simultaneously be cardio-protective and vasculogenic. Here, we present peptide sequence QHREDGS, based upon the fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-1, as a prime candidate molecule. We demonstrated previously that QHREDGS improved cardiomyocyte metabolism and mitigated serum starved apoptosis. In this paper we further demonstrate the potency of QHREDGS in its ability to enhance endothelial cell survival, metabolism and tube formation. When endothelial cells were exposed to the soluble form of QHREDGS, improvements in endothelial cell barrier functionality, nitric oxide production and cell metabolism (ATP levels) in serum starved conditions were found. The functionality of the peptide was then examined when conjugated to collagen-chitosan hydrogel, a potential carrier for in vivo application. The presence of the peptide in the hydrogel mitigated paclitaxel induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the peptide modified hydrogels stimulated tube-like structure formation of encapsulated endothelial cells. When integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b15\u03b21 were antibody blocked during cell encapsulation in peptide modified hydrogels, tube formation was abolished.

At 24h, overall cell attachment was lowest on fetal ECM; however, ~80% of the cells were cardiomyocytes, while many non-myocytes attached to older ECM and poly-l-lysine controls. After 5 days, the cardiomyocyte population remained highest on fetal ECM, with a 4-fold increase in number. Significantly more cardiomyocytes stained positively for the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 on fetal ECM compared with other substrates at 5 days, suggesting that proliferation may be a major mechanism of cardiomyocyte expansion on young ECM.

{"title": "Assessing the translatability of in vivo cardiotoxicity mechanisms to in vitro models using causal reasoning.", "abstract": "Drug-induced cardiac toxicity has been implicated in 31% of drug withdrawals in the USA. The fact that the risk for cardiac-related adverse events goes undetected in preclinical studies for so many drugs underscores the need for better, more predictive in vitro safety screens to be deployed early in the drug discovery process. Unfortunately, many questions remain about the ability to accurately translate findings from simple cellular systems to the mechanisms that drive toxicity in the complex in vivo environment. In this study, we analyzed translatability of cardiotoxic effects for a diverse set of drugs from rodents to two different cell systems (rat heart tissue-derived cells (H9C2) and primary rat cardiomyocytes (RCM)) based on their transcriptional response. To unravel the altered pathway, we applied a novel computational systems biology approach, the Causal Reasoning Engine (CRE), to infer upstream molecular events causing the observed gene expression changes. By cross-referencing the cardiotoxicity annotations with the pathway analysis, we found evidence of mechanistic convergence towards common molecular mechanisms regardless of the cardiotoxic phenotype. We also experimentally verified two specific molecular hypotheses that translated well from in vivo to in vitro (Kruppel-like factor 4, KLF4 and Transforming growth factor beta 1, TGFB1) supporting the validity of the predictions of the computational pathway analysis. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the use of a novel systems biology approach to predict mechanisms of toxicity such as KLF4 and TGFB1 that translate from in vivo to in vitro. We also show that more complex in vitro models such as primary rat cardiomyocytes may not offer any advantage over simpler models such as immortalized H9C2 cells in terms of translatability to in vivo effects if we consider the right endpoints for the model.

Bluefin tuna hearts offer a unique model to investigate processes underlying thermal acclimation. Their hearts, while supporting an endothermic physiology, operate at ambient temperature, and are presented with a thermal challenge when migrating to different thermal regimes. Here, we examined the molecular responses in atrial and ventricular tissues of Pacific bluefin tuna acclimated to 14\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C. Quantitative PCR studies showed an increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase gene expression with cold acclimation and an induction of Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger gene at both cold and warm temperatures. These data provide evidence for thermal plasticity of excitation-contraction coupling gene expression in bluefin tunas and indicate an increased capacity for internal Ca(2+) storage in cardiac myocytes at 14\u00b0C. Transcriptomic analysis showed profound changes in cardiac tissues with acclimation. A principal component analysis revealed that temperature effect was greatest on gene expression in warm-acclimated atrium. Overall data showed an increase in cardiac energy metabolism at 14\u00b0C, potentially compensating for cold temperature to optimize bluefin tuna performance in colder oceans. In contrast, metabolic enzyme activity and gene expression data suggest a decrease in ATP production at 25\u00b0C. Expression of genes involved in protein turnover and molecular chaperones was also decreased at 25\u00b0C. Expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response and programmed cell death suggest an increase in oxidative damage and apoptosis at 25\u00b0C, particularly in the atrium.

Continuous high Ang II for 3 days markedly increased cardiomyocyte size, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cardiomyocytes, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. These deleterious effects were also observed in the memory condition (high Ang II for 2 days followed by normal medium for 1 day). Furthermore, in a mouse model, Ang II infusion for 3 weeks significantly increased cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, inflammation, and ROS generation but decreased cardiac function compared with control mice, and similar effects were also observed in mice in the memory condition. Importantly, blockade of NADPH oxidase using apocynin diminished the induction of high Ang II stress markers in isolated cardiomyocytes and in the mouse heart. These effects were associated with inhibition of NADPH oxidase-mediated AKT/mTOR/S6K and ERK signaling pathways.

{"title": "Evaluating the effect of three-dimensional visualization on force application and performance time during robotics-assisted mitral valve repair.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of three-dimensional (3D) binocular, stereoscopic, and two-dimensional (2D) monocular visualization on robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty versus conventional techniques in an ex vivo animal model. In addition, we sought to determine whether these effects were consistent between novices and experts in robotics-assisted cardiac surgery.\nA cardiac surgery test-bed was constructed to measure forces applied during mitral valve annuloplasty. Sutures were passed through the porcine mitral valve annulus by the participants with different levels of experience in robotics-assisted surgery and tied in place using both robotics-assisted and conventional surgery techniques.\nThe mean time for both the experts and the novices using 3D visualization was significantly less than that required using 2D vision (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the maximum force applied by the novices to the mitral valve during suturing (P = 0.7) and suture tying (P = 0.6) using either 2D or 3D visualization. The mean time required and forces applied by both the experts and the novices were significantly less using the conventional surgical technique than when using the robotic system with either 2D or 3D vision (P < 0.001).\nDespite high-quality binocular images, both the experts and the novices applied significantly more force to the cardiac tissue during 3D robotics-assisted mitral valve annuloplasty than during conventional open mitral valve annuloplasty. This finding suggests that 3D visualization does not fully compensate for the absence of haptic feedback in robotics-assisted cardiac surgery.", "journal": "Innovations (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2013-08-31", "authors": ["Maria ECurrie", "Ana LuisaTrejos", "ReizaRayman", "Michael W AChu", "RajniPatel", "TerryPeters", "Bob BKiaii"], "doi": "10.1097/IMI.0b013e3182a3200e"}
{"title": "Cell therapy for heart failure: a comprehensive overview of experimental and clinical studies, current challenges, and future directions.", "abstract": "Despite significant therapeutic advances, the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF) remains poor, and current therapeutic approaches are palliative in the sense that they do not address the underlying problem of the loss of cardiac tissue. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of HF by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-myocardial regeneration. For the first time since cardiac transplantation, a therapy is being developed to eliminate the underlying cause of HF, not just to achieve damage control. Since the initial report of cell therapy (skeletal myoblasts) in HF in 1998, research has proceeded at lightning speed, and numerous preclinical and clinical studies have been performed that support the ability of various stem cell populations to improve cardiac function and reduce infarct size in both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Nevertheless, we are still at the dawn of this therapeutic revolution. Many important issues (eg, mechanism(s) of action of stem cells, long-term engraftment, optimal cell type(s), and dose, route, and frequency of cell administration) remain to be resolved, and no cell therapy has been conclusively shown to be effective. The purpose of this article is to critically review the large body of work performed with respect to the use of stem/progenitor cells in HF, both at the experimental and clinical levels, and to discuss current controversies, unresolved issues, challenges, and future directions.

{"title": "Effect and mechanism of propofol on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in type 2 diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Propofol has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in various experimental models by reducing oxidative stress, protecting mitochondrial function and suppressing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of propofol on myocardial I/R injury in type 2 diabetic rats.\nA total of 24 streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were randomly divided into three equal groups as follows: the DI group with myocardial I/R, which was induced by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30min, followed by 2h of reperfusion; the DP group, which underwent I/R and propofol infusion at 6mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7h(-1); and the DC group, which underwent sham operations without tightening of the coronary sutures. As a control, 24 healthy, age-matched, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: the CI, CP and CC groups. The injured cardiac tissues were removed for microscopic examination after reperfusion. The serum concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET-1); the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 within the cardiac structures; and the number of apoptotic myocardial cells were measured.\nCompared with the baseline levels before ischemia, the serum concentration of ET-1 after 2h of reperfusion was increased in the CI and DI groups, while the concentration of NO in these groups decreased after reperfusion. Compared with the I/R groups, propofol increased the content of NO and decreased the content of ET-1. Compared with the sham operation groups, I/R decreased the ratio of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 to the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which resulted in an elevation of the index of apoptosis (AI). In contrast, compared with the I/R group, propofol increased the Bcl-2-to-Bax ratio and decreased the AI. I/R increased the expression of caspase-3 compared with the sham treatment groups, while treatment with propofol reduced caspase-3 expression relative to the I/R groups.\nThese data suggest that propofol can protect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in both normal and type 2 diabetic rats, possibly by attenuating endothelial cell injury and inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2013-08-31", "authors": ["ChangfuLin", "HaijingSui", "JieGu", "XueYang", "LinDeng", "WenzhiLi", "WengangDing", "DongmeiLi", "YingchunYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2013.08.002"}

We changed surface properties of the PLA nanofilms (i.e., roughness and wettability) as a function of MNPs concentration. We found that the incorporation of MNPs into the nanofilms enhanced both proliferation and adhesion of H9c2 cells. Through the morphological assessment of the differentiated H9c2 cells, we also found that the presence of MNPs significantly increased the fusion index and the surface area of myotubes.

{"title": "Stanniocalcin1 is a key mediator of amyloidogenic light chain induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Immunoglobulin light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL) results from overproduction of circulating amyloidogenic LC proteins and subsequent amyloid fibril deposition in organs. Mortality in AL amyloidosis patients is highly associated with a rapidly progressive AL cardiomyopathy, marked by profound impairment of diastolic and systolic cardiac function and significant early mortality. While myocardial fibril deposition contributes to the severe diastolic dysfunction seen in AL cardiomyopathy patients, the degree of fibril deposition has not been found to correlate with prognosis. Previously, we and others showed a direct cardiotoxic effect of amyloidogenic LC proteins (AL-LC), which may contribute to the pathophysiology and mortality observed in AL cardiomyopathy patients. However, the mechanisms underlying AL-LC related cardiotoxicity remain unknown. Mammalian stanniocalcin1 (STC1) is associated with a number of cellular processes including oxidative stress and cell death. Herein, we find that STC1 expression is elevated in cardiac tissue from AL cardiomyopathy patients, and is induced in isolated cardiomyocytes in response to AL-LC, but not non-amyloidogenic LC. STC1 overexpression in vitro recapitulates the pathophysiology of AL-LC mediated cardiotoxicity, with increased ROS production, contractile dysfunction and cell death. Overexpression of STC1 in vivo results in significant cardiac dysfunction and cell death. Genetic silencing of STC1 prevents AL-LC induced cardiotoxicity in cardiomyocytes and protects against AL-LC induced cell death and early mortality in zebrafish. The cardiotoxic effects of STC1 appears to be mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production and increased mitochondrial calcium levels.

{"title": "Localization of sodium channel subtypes in mouse ventricular myocytes using quantitative immunocytochemistry.", "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in cardiac muscle. Previously, both TTX-sensitive neuronal sodium channels (NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6) and the TTX-resistant cardiac sodium channel (NaV1.5) have been detected in cardiac myocytes, but relative levels of protein expression of the isoforms were not determined. Using a quantitative approach, we analyzed z-series of confocal microscopy images from individual mouse myocytes stained with either anti-NaV1.1, anti-NaV1.2, anti-NaV1.3, anti-NaV1.4, anti-NaV1.5, or anti-NaV1.6 antibodies and calculated the relative intensity of staining for these sodium channel isoforms. Our results indicate that the TTX-sensitive channels represented approximately 23% of the total channels, whereas the TTX-resistant NaV1.5 channel represented 77% of the total channel staining in mouse ventricular myocytes. These ratios are consistent with previous electrophysiological studies in mouse ventricular myocytes. NaV1.5 was located at the cell surface, with high density at the intercalated disc, but was absent from the transverse (t)-tubular system, suggesting that these channels support surface conduction and inter-myocyte transmission. Low-level cell surface staining of NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 channels suggest a minor role in surface excitation and conduction. Conversely, NaV1.1 and NaV1.3 channels are localized to the t-tubules and are likely to support t-tubular transmission of the action potential to the myocyte interior. This quantitative immunocytochemical approach for assessing sodium channel density and localization provides a more precise view of the relative importance and possible roles of these individual sodium channel protein isoforms in mouse ventricular myocytes and may be applicable to other species and cardiac tissue types.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2013-08-29", "authors": ["Ruth EWestenbroek", "SebastianBischoff", "YingFu", "Sebastian K GMaier", "William ACatterall", "ToddScheuer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.08.004"}

Although HCM-causing truncation mutations in cMyBP-C are well studied, the growing number of disease-related cMyBP-C missense mutations remain poorly understood. Our objective was to define the primary contractile effect and molecular disease mechanisms of the prevalent cMyBP-C E258K HCM-causing mutation in nonremodeled murine engineered cardiac tissue (mECT). Wild-type and human E258K cMyBP-C were expressed in mECT lacking endogenous mouse cMyBP-C through adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. Expression of E258K cMyBP-C did not affect cardiac cell survival and was appropriately incorporated into the cardiac sarcomere. Functionally, expression of E258K cMyBP-C caused accelerated contractile kinetics and severely compromised twitch force amplitude in mECT. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that E258K cMyBP-C abolished interaction between the N terminal of cMyBP-C and myosin heavy chain sub-fragment 2 (S2). Furthermore, this mutation increased the affinity between the N terminal of cMyBP-C and actin. Assessment of phosphorylation of three serine residues in cMyBP-C showed that aberrant phosphorylation of cMyBP-C is unlikely to be responsible for altering these interactions. We show that the E258K mutation in cMyBP-C abolishes interaction between N-terminal cMyBP-C and myosin S2 by directly disrupting the cMyBP-C-S2 interface, independent of cMyBP-C phosphorylation. Similar to cMyBP-C ablation or phosphorylation, abolition of this inhibitory interaction accelerates contractile kinetics. Additionally, the E258K mutation impaired force production of mECT, which suggests that in addition to the loss of physiological function, this mutation disrupts contractility possibly by tethering the thick and thin filament or acting as an internal load.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2013-08-28", "authors": ["Willem JDe Lange", "Adrian CGrimes", "Laura FHegge", "Alexander MSpring", "Taylor MBrost", "J CarterRalphe"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.201311018\n10.1074/jbc.M610899200\n10.1016/j.jmb.2008.09.065\n10.1016/S0195-668X(03)00466-4\n10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201190\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.014\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.028\n10.1073/pnas.0606741103\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178996\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.183897\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.012\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242354\n10.1085/jgp.201210837\n10.1186/1471-2350-9-95\n10.1016/0002-9149(91)90441-M\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.009\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.10.2597\n10.1016/j.jmb.2008.02.044\n10.1006/jmbi.1998.2522\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00727-9\n10.1161/01.RES.0000012222.70819.64\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01244.2005\n10.1016/j.jsb.2010.12.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000096363.85588.9A\n10.1016/j.jmb.2011.09.026\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.4.785\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.202440\n10.1007/s10974-011-9268-3\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.519bh.x\n10.1056/NEJMoa075463\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.08.014\n10.1056/NEJM199804303381802\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.111.960831\n10.1074/jbc.M606949200\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000066323.15244.54\n10.1074/jbc.M110.170605\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242560\n10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00242-2\n10.1074/jbc.M808850200\n10.1016/j.cccn.2004.09.016\n10.1056/NEJM199703133361107\n10.1152/ajpheart.00205.2006\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.838672\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.07.045\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.201251\n10.1073/pnas.93.17.8999"}

{"title": "Urinary bladder matrix promotes site appropriate tissue formation following right ventricle outflow tract repair.", "abstract": "The current prevalence and severity of heart defects requiring functional replacement of cardiac tissue pose a serious clinical challenge. Biologic scaffolds are an attractive tissue engineering approach to cardiac repair because they avoid sensitization associated with homograft materials and theoretically possess the potential for growth in similar patterns as surrounding native tissue. Both urinary bladder matrix (UBM) and cardiac ECM (C-ECM) have been previously investigated as scaffolds for cardiac repair with modest success, but have not been compared directly. In other tissue locations, bone marrow derived cells have been shown to play a role in the remodeling process, but this has not been investigated for UBM in the cardiac location, and has never been studied for C-ECM. The objectives of the present study were to compare the effectiveness of an organ-specific C-ECM patch with a commonly used ECM scaffold for myocardial tissue repair of the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT), and to examine the role of bone marrow derived cells in the remodeling response. A chimeric rat model in which all bone marrow cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated and used to show the ability of ECM scaffolds derived from the heart and bladder to support cardiac function and cellular growth in the RVOT. The results from this study suggest that urinary bladder matrix may provide a more appropriate substrate for myocardial repair than cardiac derived matrices, as shown by differences in the remodeling responses following implantation, as well as the presence of site appropriate cells and the formation of immature, myocardial tissue.", "journal": "Organogenesis", "date": "2013-08-27", "authors": ["Nathaniel TRemlinger", "Thomas WGilbert", "MasahiroYoshida", "Brogan NGuest", "RyotaroHashizume", "Michelle LWeaver", "William RWagner", "Bryan NBrown", "KimimasaTobita", "Peter DWearden"], "doi": "10.4161/org.25394\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.187998\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31828124ad\n10.1067/mtc.2002.127449\n10.1055/s-0029-1185513\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.06.003\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.06.050\n10.1016/S0022-5223(98)70449-0\n10.1097/01.ju.0000121377.61788.ad\n10.1097/01.prs.0000181692.71901.bd\n10.1186/1752-1947-6-234\n10.1126/science.1189345\n10.1510/icvts.2011.280016\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0430\n10.3727/000000006783982368\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.11.035\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0698\n10.1038/nm.2170\n10.1038/nm.2193\n10.1016/S1010-7940(96)80328-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.067\n10.1089/ten.2006.0437\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0730\n10.1172/JCI61974\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1002/jcb.24130\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1159/000331400\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.09.039\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0392\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.07.008\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2006.06.085\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0587\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.04.071\n10.1016/j.gie.2008.04.022\n10.1016/j.jss.2007.04.035\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.11.031\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.054\n10.1016/S0301-472X(01)00729-9\n10.1002/jor.20071\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0162\n10.1046/j.1524-475x.2001.00495.x\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0419\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0264\n10.1016/j.it.2004.09.015\n10.1038/nri2448\n10.1002/emmm.201201737\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.040"}
{"title": "RNA binding proteins in the regulation of heart development.", "abstract": "In vivo, RNA molecules are constantly accompanied by RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which are intimately involved in every step of RNA biology, including transcription, editing, splicing, transport and localization, stability, and translation. RBPs therefore have opportunities to shape gene expression at multiple levels. This capacity is particularly important during development, when dynamic chemical and physical changes give rise to complex organs and tissues. This review discusses RBPs in the context of heart development. Since the targets and functions of most RBPs--in the heart and at large--are not fully understood, this review focuses on the expression and roles of RBPs that have been implicated in specific stages of heart development or developmental pathology. RBPs are involved in nearly every stage of cardiogenesis, including the formation, morphogenesis, and maturation of the heart. A fuller understanding of the roles and substrates of these proteins could ultimately provide attractive targets for the design of therapies for congenital heart defects, cardiovascular disease, or cardiac tissue repair.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2013-08-27", "authors": ["YotamBlech-Hermoni", "Andrea NLadd"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2013.08.008"}

However, the cellular mechanism underlying LPC-induced cardiomyocyte damage remains to be elucidated. This study focuses on the effects of LPC on cardiomyocyte gap junction. At 30\u03bcM, LPC decreased the spontaneous contraction rates of cardiomyocytes, and caused arrhythmic contraction without affecting cell viability. Connexin43 (Cx43) was seen as large plaques at cell junctions in control cells, whereas upon LPC treatment, the intensity of Cx43 staining was decreased in a concentration-sensitive manner and Cx43 staining appeared as tiny dots at cell junctions with a corresponding increase in cytoplasmic punctate staining. This distributional change of Cx43 was accompanied by an impairment of the gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC). Further, LPC treatment induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and PKC-dependent Cx43 phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 368. Pre-treatment with a specific PKC\u025b inhibitor, eV1-2, prevented the LPC-induced Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368 and the loss of Cx43 from gap junctions, both of which may disturb GJIC functions. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of PKC\u025b in H9c2 cells prevented LPC-induced serine phosphorylation of Cx43, confirming the role of PKC\u025b in Cx43 serine phosphorylation. Double labeling immunofluorescence showed that LPC increased the colocalization of Cx43 with ubiquitin, and pretreatment with MG132 effectively prevented LPC-induced gap junction disassembly. LPC increased the ubiquitination of Cx43, which was blocked by eV1-2 pretreatment, suggesting that LPC accelerated the intracellular degradation of Cx43 via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. It can be concluded that LPC destroyed the structure and function of gap junctions via PKC\u025b-mediated serine phosphorylation of Cx43. PKC\u025b inhibitors might therefore be effective in prevention of LPC-related diseases.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2013-08-27", "authors": ["Chih-KaiLiao", "Hsiang-HsiCheng", "Sheng-DeWang", "Dong-FengYeih", "Seu-MeiWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2013.08.001"}
{"title": "Computational estimation of tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes using noisy NMR data from cardiac biopsies.", "abstract": "The aerobic energy metabolism of cardiac muscle cells is of major importance for the contractile function of the heart. Because energy metabolism is very heterogeneously distributed in heart tissue, especially during coronary disease, a method to quantify metabolic fluxes in small tissue samples is desirable. Taking tissue biopsies after infusion of substrates labeled with stable carbon isotopes makes this possible in animal experiments. However, the appreciable noise level in NMR spectra of extracted tissue samples makes computational estimation of metabolic fluxes challenging and a good method to define confidence regions was not yet available.\nHere we present a computational analysis method for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. The method was validated using measurements on extracts of single tissue biopsies taken from porcine heart in vivo. Isotopic enrichment of glutamate was measured by NMR spectroscopy in tissue samples taken at a single time point after the timed infusion of 13C labeled substrates for the TCA cycle. The NMR intensities for glutamate were analyzed with a computational model describing carbon transitions in the TCA cycle and carbon exchange with amino acids. The model dynamics depended on five flux parameters, which were optimized to fit the NMR measurements. To determine confidence regions for the estimated fluxes, we used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate extensive ensembles of feasible flux combinations that describe the data within measurement precision limits. To validate our method, we compared myocardial oxygen consumption calculated from the TCA cycle flux with in vivo blood gas measurements for 38 hearts under several experimental conditions, e.g. during coronary artery narrowing.\nDespite the appreciable NMR noise level, the oxygen consumption in the tissue samples, estimated from the NMR spectra, correlates with blood-gas oxygen uptake measurements for the whole heart. The MCMC method provides confidence regions for the estimated metabolic fluxes in single cardiac biopsies, taking the quantified measurement noise level and the nonlinear dependencies between parameters fully into account.", "journal": "BMC systems biology", "date": "2013-08-24", "authors": ["HannesHettling", "David J CAlders", "JaapHeringa", "Thomas WBinsl", "A B JohanGroeneveld", "Johannes H G Mvan Beek"], "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-7-82\n10.1096/fj.09-129171\n10.1007/978-1-4615-4863-8_58\n10.1113/expphysiol.2006.036228\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq018\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btl445\n10.1186/1475-2859-8-25\n10.1186/1752-0509-6-9\n10.1016/j.ymben.2006.01.004\n10.1152/ajpheart.00338.2003\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002130\n10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80080-9\n10.1073/pnas.86.16.6426\n10.1152/ajpheart.00983.2003\n10.1016/j.csda.2007.02.021\n10.1074/jbc.270.14.7999\n10.1161/01.RES.42.1.119\n10.1016/S1071-3581(00)70011-0\n10.1016/j.abb.2007.02.022\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.668665\n10.1038/jcbfm.1995.2\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.1.270\n10.1186/1752-0509-5-41"}

Neuregulin-1 (NRG) is a growth factor involved in cardiac repair after MI. We previously described how biocompatible and biodegradable microparticles, which are able to release NRG in a sustained manner, represent a valuable approach to avoid problems related to the short half-life after systemic administration of proteins. The effectiveness of this strategy could be improved by combining NRG with several cytokines involved in cardiac regeneration. The present study investigates the potential feasibility of using NRG-releasing particle scaffold combined with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) as a multiple growth factor delivery-based tissue engineering strategy for implantation in the infarcted myocardium. NRG-releasing particle scaffolds with a suitable size for intramyocardial implantation were prepared by TROMS. Next, ADSC were adhered to particle scaffolds and their potential for heart administration was assessed in a MI rat model. NRG was successfully encapsulated reaching encapsulation efficiencies of 92.58 \u00b1 3.84%. NRG maintained its biological activity after the microencapsulation process. ADSCs adhered efficiently to particle scaffolds within a few hours. The ADSC-cytokine delivery system developed proved to be compatible with intramyocardial administration in terms of injectability through a 23-gauge needle and tissue response.

However, only a small fraction of the introduced stem cells are detected at the site of the injury, merely two weeks after this therapeutic intervention.

To resolve the aforementioned problem, we genetically and molecularly bioengineered heterospecific, tetravalent antibodies (htAbs), which have both exquisite specificity and high affinity towards human, pluripotent, stem cells through the htAbs' domains binding SSEA-4, SSEA-3, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81, as well as towards the injured cardiac muscle through the htAbs' domains binding human cardiac myosin, \u03b1-actinin, actin, and titin.

We report here on our work, where for the first time, a 3-dimensional (3D) spring-like fiber scaffold was fabricated, successfully mimicking the coiled perimysial fibers of the heart. We hypothesized that since in vivo straightening and re-coiling of these fibers allow stretching and contraction of the myocardium in the direction of the cardiomyocytes, such a scaffold can support the assembly of a functional cardiac tissue capable of generating a strong contraction force. In this study, the mechanical properties of both spring-like single fibers and 3D scaffolds composed of them were investigated. The measurements showed that they have increased elasticity and extensibility compared to corresponding straight fibers and straight fiber scaffolds. We have also shown that cardiac cells cultivated on single spring-like fibers formed cell-fiber interactions that induced fiber stretching in the direction of contraction. Moreover, cardiac cells engineered within 3D thick spring-like fiber scaffolds formed a functional tissue exhibiting significantly improved function, including stronger contraction force (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), higher beating rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and lower excitation threshold (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), compared to straight fiber scaffolds.

A recent study reported a case of a person affected by DS who carried mutations in FBN1, the gene causative for a connective tissue disorder called Marfan Syndrome (MFS). The fact that the person did not have any cardiac alterations suggested compensation effects due to DS. This observation is supported by a previous DS meta-analysis at the molecular level where we have found an overall upregulation of FBN1 (which is usually downregulated in MFS). Additionally, that result was cross-validated with independent expression data from DS heart tissue. The aim of this work is to elucidate the role of FBN1 in DS and to establish a molecular link to MFS and MFS-related syndromes using a computational approach. To reach that, we conducted different analytical approaches over two DS studies (our previous meta-analysis and independent expression data from DS heart tissue) and revealed expression alterations in the FBN1 interaction network, in FBN1 co-expressed genes and FBN1-related pathways. After merging the significant results from different datasets with a Bayesian approach, we prioritized 85 genes that were able to distinguish control from DS cases. We further found evidence for several of these genes (47%), such as FBN1, DCN, and COL1A2, being dysregulated in MFS and MFS-related diseases.

This was accompanied by an increased in the oxidative stress as evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased antioxidant enzyme capacity along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK-MB) serum levels as compared with the control. Tempol treatment significantly corrected the changes in the cardiac extracellular matrix, TGF-\u03b2, ROS or serum LDH, CK-MB levels, and normalized MMP-2 activity along with preservation of cardiac tissues integrity of diabetic rats against damaging responses. Moreover, tempol normalized the elevated systolic blood pressure and improved some cardiac functions in diabetic rats. Collectively, our data suggest a potential protective role of tempol against diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis in rats via reducing oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["AshrafTaye", "Mekky MAbouzied", "Omar M MMohafez"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-013-0904-x"}

Factors affecting their dynamics, such as spatiotemporal drift, are of great interest for particular applications. Here, we propose a quantitative description for spiral wave dynamics on curved surfaces which shows that for a wide class of systems, including the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and anisotropic cardiac tissue, the Ricci curvature scalar of the surface is the main determinant of spiral wave drift. The theory provides explicit equations for spiral wave drift direction, drift velocity, and the period of rotation.

In the present paper, one-dimensional tissue of the phase I Luo-Rudy model is numerically investigated. The effects of various parameters of pacing signals on bistability width are studied. The following conclusions are obtained: (i) Pacing can be classified into two types: pulsatile and sinusoidal types. Pulsatile pacing reduces bistability width as its magnitude is increased. Sinusoidal pacing increases the width as its amplitude is increased. (ii) In a pacing period the hyperpolarizing part plays a more important role than the depolarizing part. Variations of the hyperpolarizing ratio in a period evidently change the width of bistability and its variation tendency. (iii) A dynamical mechanism is proposed to qualitatively explain the phenomena, which reveals the reason for the different effects of pulsatile and sinusoidal pacing on bistability.

Iron chelators and other antioxidants have not completely succeeded in mitigating this effect. One hindrance to the development of cardioprotectants is the lack of physiologically-relevant animal models to simultaneously study antitumor activity and cardioprotection. Therefore, we optimized a syngeneic rat model and examined the mechanisms by which oxidative stress affects outcome. Immune-competent spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were implanted with passaged, SHR-derived, breast tumor cell line, SST-2. Tumor growth and cytokine responses (IL-1A, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1) were observed for two weeks post-implantation. To demonstrate the utility of the SHR/SST-2 model for monitoring both anticancer efficacy and cardiotoxicity, we tested cardiotoxic doxorubicin alone and in combination with an established cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane, or a nitroxide conjugated to a triphenylphosphonium cation, Mito-Tempol (4) [Mito-T (4)]. As predicted, tumor reduction and cardiomyopathy were demonstrated by doxorubicin. We confirmed mitochondrial accumulation of Mito-T (4) in tumor and cardiac tissue. Dexrazoxane and Mito-T (4) ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy without altering the antitumor activity. Both agents increased the pro-survival autophagy marker LC3-II and decreased the apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the heart, independently and in combination with doxorubicin. Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis corresponding to cytotoxicity in the tumor and cardioprotection in the heart. Changes in serum levels of 8-oxo-dG-modified DNA and total protein carbonylation corresponded to cardioprotective activity. Finally, 2D-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry identified specific serum proteins oxidized under cardiotoxic conditions.

In the present study, the effects of in vitro I/R injury on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation under different substrate conditions were investigated.\nHypoxia was achieved following complete consumption of oxygen by mitochondria isolated from rat heart tissue in an experimental chamber.

Membrane potentials of myocytes from spontaneously active or electrically paced in vitro rabbit cardiac tissue preparations were recorded using intracellular glass microelectrodes. Action potentials of central and peripheral SAN, right and left atrial, and pulmonary vein myocytes were each fitted using a generic ionic model having three phenomenological ionic current components: one time-dependent inward, one time-dependent outward, and one leakage current. To bridge the gap between the single-cell ionic models and the gross electrical behaviour of the 3D whole-atrial model, a simplified 2D tissue disc with heterogeneous regions was optimised to arrive at parameters for each cell type under electrotonic load. Parameters were then incorporated into the 3D atrial model, which as a result exhibited a spontaneously active SAN able to rhythmically excite the atria.

The classification performed by SCA is an essential component of the detection and analysis of various cardiac arrhythmic disorders, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Given a digitized frame of a propagating wave, SCA constructs a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, piecewise interpolates this representation with cubic splines, and subjects the result to an accurate curvature analysis. This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on spiral-tip tracking, as it considers the entire wave front and back. To increase the smoothness of the resulting symbolic representation, the SCA uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the smoothness at join points. SCA has been applied to a number of representative types of spiral waves, and, for each type, a distinct curvature evolution in time (signature) has been identified. Distinct signatures have also been identified for spiral breakup.

The pathological progression following MI is very complex and involves a number of cell populations including cells localized within the heart, as well as cells recruited from the circulation and other tissues that participate in inflammatory and reparative processes. These cells, with their secretory factors, have pleiotropic effects that depend on the stage of inflammation and regeneration. Excessive inflammation leads to enlargement of the infarction site, pathological remodeling and eventually, heart dysfunction. Stem cell therapy represents a unique and innovative approach to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation caused by ischemic heart disease. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the crosstalk between stem cells and other cells involved in post-MI cardiac tissue repair, especially immune cells, in order to harness the beneficial effects of the immune response following MI and further improve stem cell-mediated cardiac regeneration.

This requires careful choice of cells, culture conditions, a biomaterial to act as scaffold, and crucial strategies for vascularization. Autologous stem cells with high plasticity, which would avoid the need for antirejection therapies after transplantation, are an attractive source of both cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. Most stem cells also have inherent paracrine activity, releasing cytoprotective factors and growth-promoting cytokines that can further stimulate tissue regeneration and neovascularization through recruitment of endogenous stem and progenitor cells. Current advances for growing vascularized and functional cardiac constructs with human stem cells are described, bringing us a step closer to the engineering of complex cardiac tissues such as pacemaker, conducting tissue, or contractile myocardial flaps ideal for transplantation.

{"title": "Nebivolol: a multifaceted antioxidant and cardioprotectant in hypertensive heart disease.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte necrosis with attendant microscopic scarring is a pathological feature of human hypertensive heart disease (HHD). Understanding the pathophysiological origins of necrosis is integral to its prevention. In a rat model of HHD associated with aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST), myocyte necrosis is attributable to oxidative stress induced by cytosolic-free [Ca]i and mitochondrial [Ca]m overloading in which the rate of reactive oxygen species generation overwhelms their rate of detoxification by endogenous Zn-based antioxidant defenses. We hypothesized that nebivolol (Neb), unlike another \u03b21 adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol (Aten), would have a multifaceted antioxidant potential based on its dual property as a \u03b23 receptor agonist, which activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase to stimulate nitric oxide (NO) generation. NO promotes the release of cytosolic Zn sequestered inactive by its binding protein, metallothionein. Given the reciprocal regulation between these cations, increased [Zn]i reduces Ca entry and attendant rise in [Ca]i and [Ca]m. Herein, we examined the antioxidant and cardioprotectant properties of Neb and Aten in rats receiving 4 weeks ALDOST. Compared with untreated age-/sex-matched controls, ALDOST alone or ALDOST with Aten, Neb cotreatment induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation, NO generation and a marked increase in [Zn]i with associated decline in [Ca]i and [Ca]m. Attendant antioxidant profile at subcellular and cellular levels included attenuation of mitochondrial H2O2 production and lipid peroxidation expressed as reduced 8-isoprostane concentrations in both mitochondria and cardiac tissue. Myocyte salvage was expressed as reduced microscopic scarring and tissue collagen volume fraction.

Here, we investigated the influence of transgenic (Tg) APPL1 overexpression in mice on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. Wild-type (WT) mice fed an HFD for 16 wk showed cardiac dysfunction, determined by echocardiography, with decreased ejection fraction, decreased fractional shortening, and increased end diastolic volume. HFD-fed APPL1 Tg mice were significantly protected from this dysfunction. Speckle tracking echocardiography to accurately assess cardiac tissue deformation strain and wall motion also indicated dysfunction in WT mice and a similar improvement in Tg vs. WT mice on HFD. APPL1 Tg mice had less HFD-induced increase in circulating nonesteridied fatty acid levels and myocardial lipid accumulation. Lipidomic analysis using LC-MS-MS showed HFD significantly increased myocardial contents of distinct ceramide, sphingomyelin, and diacylglycerol (DAG) species, of which increases in C16:0 and C18:0 ceramides plus C16:0 and C18:1 DAGs were attenuated in Tg mice. A glucose tolerance test indicated less peripheral insulin resistance in response to HFD in Tg mice, which was also apparent by measuring cardiac Akt phosphorylation and cardiomyocyte glucose uptake. In summary, APPL1 Tg mice exhibit improved peripheral metabolism, reduced cardiac lipotoxicity, and improved insulin sensitivity.

The architectures of native desmosomal assemblies have been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, and the network of protein domain interactions is becoming apparent. Plakophilin and desmoplakin mutations have been discovered to alter binding interfaces, structures, and stabilities of folded domains that have been resolved by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The flexibility within desmoplakin has been revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering and fluorescence assays, explaining how mechanical stresses are accommodated.

An altered glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan is at the molecular basis of muscular dystrophies defined as secondary dystroglycanopathies, that depend on malfunctioning of the enzymes in the glycosylation pathway. An increased level of transcription of the dystroglycan gene may be crucial for obtaining sufficient amounts of dystroglycan precursor substrate required for the production of the heavily glycosylated and fully functional \u03b1-dystroglycan molecule. Even slight differences in these transcriptional levels may exert a protective or pathogenetic effect, as discussed for the unique case of primary dystroglycanopathy so far identified (T192M), where the heart tissues are not affected by the pathology.

This study shows that 24-weeks of diabetes in rats induce early signs of mild cardiac alterations as indicated by an increase of oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis which are mediated, at least partially, by glycation.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2013-08-01", "authors": ["OlafBrouwers", "Joyce M Jde Vos-Houben", "Petra M GNiessen", "ToshioMiyata", "Fransvan Nieuwenhoven", "Ben J AJanssen", "GejaHageman", "Coen D AStehouwer", "Casper GSchalkwijk"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms140815724\n10.1515/cclm-2012-0878\n10.1177/1470320313480537"}
{"title": "Increased cardiac endothelin-1 and nitric oxide in adriamycin-induced acute cardiotoxicity: protective effect of Ginkgo biloba extract.", "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity and congestive heart failure are the major factors that limit the use of anti-neoplastic drug adriamycin (ADR). There is increasing experimental evidence that endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) are vasoactive mediators that regulate cardiac performance. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of ET-1 and NO in ADR-induced acute cardiotoxicity and to evaluate the protective effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) in rats. A single dose of ADR (20 mg/kg i.p.) caused a significant increase in the cardiac enzyme activities of aspartate transaminases (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) in the serum of animals. This was accompanied by significant increase in cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), ET-1 and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels. On the other hand, reduced glutathione (GSH) was significantly depressed. Histopathological examination of heart tissues showed hyalinization of the myocardium, with interstitial edema and inflammatory exudates. Pre-treatment of the animals with EGb761 (100 mg/kg, orally) 10 days before and 5 days after ADR treatment reversed the cardiac enzyme levels to normal value, decreased cardiac MDA, TAC, TNF-alpha. ET-1 and NO(x), increased GSH and reversed the histopathological damage induced by ADR. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effects of EGb761 on markers of ADR-induced acute cardiotoxicity appeared to have been mediated by the regulation of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators, as well as the inhibition of membrane lipid peroxidation. Thus, EGb761 may find use as promising adjuvant therapy to ameliorate cardiotoxicity of ADR.", "journal": "Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics", "date": "2013-08-01", "authors": ["Noha AhmedEl-Boghdady"], "doi": null}

We evaluated whether these functional alterations can be reproduced in engineered heart tissue (EHT) and yield novel mechanistic information on the function of cMyBP-C. EHTs were generated from cardiac cells of neonatal KI, heterozygous (HET) or wild-type controls (WT) and developed without apparent morphological differences. KI had 70% and HET 20% lower total cMyBP-C levels than WT, accompanied by elevated fetal gene expression. Under standard culture conditions and spontaneous beating, KI EHTs showed more frequent burst beating than WT and occasional tetanic contractions (14/96). Under electrical stimulation (6Hz, 37\u00b0C) KI EHTs exhibited shorter contraction and relaxation times and a twofold higher sensitivity to external [Ca(2+)]. Accordingly, the sensitivity to verapamil was 4-fold lower and the response to isoprenaline or the Ca(2+) sensitizer EMD 57033 2- to 4-fold smaller. The loss of EMD effect was verified in 6-week-old KI mice in vivo. HET EHTs were apparently normal under basal conditions, but showed similarly altered contractile responses to [Ca(2+)], verapamil, isoprenaline and EMD. In contrast, drug-induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) transients (Fura-2) were essentially normal. In conclusion, the present findings in auxotonically contracting EHTs support the idea that cMyBP-C's normal role is to suppress force generation at low intracellular Ca(2+) and stabilize the power-stroke step of the cross bridge cycle. Pharmacological testing in EHT unmasked a disease phenotype in HET.

This study investigated whether the natural polyphenolic compound resveratrol could be used as a prophylactic treatment to alleviate sepsis-related myocardial injury; the underlying molecular mechanisms were deciphered by both in vitro and in vivo experiments.\nA mouse model of endotoxin-induced cardiomyopathy was developed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS, and resveratrol was administered prophylatically to the animals. Serum LDH and CK activities were measured to detect myocardial injury, and echocardiography was performed to monitor cardiac structure and function. Various cytokines/chemokines and the Nrf2 antioxidant defense system were examined in the heart tissue. The effects of resveratrol on LPS-induced Nrf2 activation, ROS generation, and apoptotic cell death were further investigated in cultured primary human cardiomyocytes. An Nrf2 specific siRNA was used to define its role in resveratrol-mediated cardiomyocyte protective effect.\nResveratrol pretreatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced myocardial injury in mice, which was associated with suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and enhanced Nrf2 activation in the heart. In cultured primary human cardiomyocytes, resveratrol activated Nrf2, inhibited LPS-induced ROS generation, and effectively protected the cells from LPS-induced apoptotic cell death. Knockdown of Nrf2 abrogated resveratrol-mediated protection of the cells from LPS-induced cell death.\nResveratrol effectively alleviates endotoxin-induced cardiac toxicity through mechanisms that involve the Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway.

There is increasing evidence that microvascular damage is involved. Endoglin, an accessory receptor for TGF-\u03b21, is highly expressed in damaged endothelial cells and may play a crucial role in cell proliferation and revascularization of damaged heart tissue. We have therefore specifically examined the role of endoglin in microvascular damage and repair in the irradiated heart.\nA single dose of 16 Gy was delivered to the heart of adult Eng(+/+) or Eng(+/-) mice and damage was evaluated at 4, 20 and 40 weeks, relative to age-matched controls.

Fibrosis related genes, TGF-\u03b21, ALK 5 and PDGF, were only upregulated in Eng(+/+) mice during the early phase of radiation-induced cardiac damage (4 weeks). In addition, only the Eng(+/+) mice showed significant upregulation of collagen deposition in the early fibrotic phase (20 weeks) after irradiation. Despite these differences in gene expression, there was no reduction in inflammatory invasion (CD45+cells) of irradiated Eng(+/-) hearts. Microvascular damage (microvascular density, alkaline phosphatase and von-Willebrand-Factor expression) was also similar in both strains.\nEng(+/-) mice displayed impaired early inflammatory and fibrotic responses to high dose irradiation compared to Eng(+/+) littermates.

The therapeutic potential of DPPIV inhibition in preventing cardiac dysfunction is also investigated.\nMeasurements of DPPIV activity in blood samples obtained from 190 patients with HF and 42 controls demonstrated that patients with HF exhibited an increase of \u2248130% in circulating DPPIV activity compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, an inverse correlation was observed between serum DPPIV activity and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction in patients with HF. Similarly, radiofrequency LV ablation-induced HF rats displayed higher DPPIV activity in the plasma (\u224850%) and heart tissue (\u22483.5-fold) compared with sham-operated rats. Moreover, positive correlations were observed between the plasma DPPIV activity and LV end-diastolic pressure and lung congestion. Two days after surgery, 1 group of LV ablation-induced HF rats was treated with the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin (40 mg/kg BID) for 6 weeks, whereas the remaining rats were administered water. Hemodynamic measurements demonstrated that radiofrequency LV-ablated rats treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant attenuation of HF-related cardiac dysfunction, including LV end-diastolic pressure, systolic performance, and chamber stiffness. Sitagliptin treatment also attenuated cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and minimized pulmonary congestion.\nCollectively, the results presented herein associate circulating DPPIV activity with poorer cardiovascular outcomes in human and experimental HF.

{"title": "CB1 receptor mediates the effects of glucocorticoids on AMPK activity in the hypothalamus.", "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a regulator of cellular and systemic energy homeostasis, can be influenced by several hormones. Tissue-specific alteration of AMPK activity by glucocorticoids may explain the increase in appetite, the accumulation of lipids in adipose tissues, and the detrimental cardiac effects of Cushing's syndrome. Endocannabinoids are known to mediate the effects of various hormones and to influence AMPK activity. Cannabinoids have central orexigenic and direct peripheral metabolic effects via the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). In our preliminary experiments, WT mice received implants of a corticosterone-containing pellet to establish a mouse model of Cushing's syndrome. Subsequently, WT and Cb1 (Cnr1)-knockout (CB1-KO) littermates were treated with corticosterone and AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, various adipose tissues, liver and cardiac tissue was measured. Corticosterone-treated CB1-KO mice showed a lack of weight gain and of increase in hypothalamic and hepatic AMPK activity. In adipose tissues, baseline AMPK activity was higher in CB1-KO mice, but a glucocorticoid-induced drop was observed, similar to that observed in WT mice. Cardiac AMPK levels were reduced in CB1-KO mice, but while WT mice showed significantly reduced AMPK activity following glucocorticoid treatment, CB1-KO mice showed a paradoxical increase. Our findings indicate the importance of the CB1 receptor in the central orexigenic effect of glucocorticoid-induced activation of hypothalamic AMPK activity. In the periphery adipose tissues, changes may occur independently of the CB1 receptor, but the receptor appears to alter the responsiveness of the liver and myocardial tissues to glucocorticoids.

In this study, we have identified a novel strategy to enhance cardiac differentiation of human iPS cells by treating embryoid bodies (EBs) with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), together with activin A and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Over a narrow window of concentrations, TSA (1 ng/ml) directed the differentiation of human iPS cells into a cardiomyocyte lineage. TSA also exerted an additive effect with activin A (100 ng/ml) and BMP4 (20 ng/ml). The resulting cardiomyocytes expressed several cardiac-specific transcription factors and contractile proteins at both gene and protein levels. Functionally, the contractile EBs displayed calcium cycling and were responsive to the chronotropic agents isoprenaline (0.1 \u03bcM) and carbachol (1 \u03bcM). Implanting microdissected beating areas of iPS cells into tissue engineering chambers in immunocompromised rats produced engineered constructs that supported their survival, and they maintained spontaneous contraction. Human cardiomyocytes were identified as compact patches of muscle tissue incorporated within a host fibrocellular stroma and were vascularized by host neovessels.

To precisely define Tm isoform expression in the human heart, towards a better understanding of their functional roles, we have employed top-down mass spectrometry for in-depth proteomic characterization of Tm isoforms.

Interestingly, our data revealed regional variations of Tm isoforms and post-translational modifications in the human heart. Specifically, the expression level of \u03ba-Tm was highest in the left atrium but nearly undetectable in the left ventricle. The phosphorylation level of \u03b1-Tm (p\u03b1-Tm) was significantly higher in the atria than it was in the ventricles. The sequences of all Tm isoforms were characterized and the sites of post-translational modifications were localized.

Calsequestrin (CASQ) is a major Ca(2+)-storage protein within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of both cardiac and skeletal muscles. CASQ acts as a Ca(2+) buffer and Ca(2+)-channel regulator through its unique Ca(2+)-dependent oligomerization. Equilibrium dialysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy experiments illustrated the perturbational effect of cocaine on CASQ2 polymerization, resulting in substantial reduction of its Ca(2+)-binding capacity. We also confirmed the accumulation of cocaine in rat heart tissue and the substantial effects cocaine has on cultured C2C12 cells. The same experiments were performed with methamphetamine as a control, which displayed neither affinity for CASQ2 nor any significant effects on its function. Since cocaine did not have any direct effect on the Ca(2+)-release channel judging from our single channel recordings, these studies provide new insights into how cocaine may interfere with the normal E-C coupling mechanism with lethal arrhythmogenic consequences.\nWe propose that cocaine accumulates in SR through its affinity for CASQ2 and affects both SR Ca(2+) storage and release by altering the normal CASQ2 Ca(2+)-dependent polymerization. By this mechanism, cocaine use could produce serious cardiac problems, especially in people who have genetically-impaired CASQ2, defects in other E-C coupling components, or compromised cocaine metabolism and clearance.", "journal": "Drug and alcohol dependence", "date": "2013-07-24", "authors": ["Emiliano JSanchez", "Robert PHayes", "John TBarr", "Kevin MLewis", "Brian NWebb", "Arun KSubramanian", "Mark SNissen", "Jeffrey PJones", "Eric AShelden", "Barbara ASorg", "MichaelFill", "James OSchenk", "ChulheeKang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.06.012"}

In these studies, we have used a mouse model containing a cardiac-specific, oxygen-stabilized, doxycycline (Dox)-off regulated HIF-1\u03b1 transgene to probe the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in cardioprotection. Hearts used in these studies were derived from wild-type (WT), noninduced (Non-I), and 2 day (2D) and 6 day (6D) Dox-deprived mice. Whereas HIF-1\u03b1 protein is undetectable in WT mice, it is present in heart tissue of \"noninduced\" transgenic mice, presumably because of leakiness of the promoter construct. In mice denied Dox for 2 or 6 days, HIF-1\u03b1 is overexpressed to a much greater extent than Non-I or WT animals, as expected. WT and HIF-1\u03b1-expressing hearts (Non-I, 2D and 6D induced) were subjected to 30 min of ischemia, and functional recovery was measured upon reperfusion. Recovery of preischemic left ventricular developed pressure was 14% for WT, 67% for Non-I hearts, 64% for 2D-induced, and 62% for 6D-induced hearts. 6D-induced HIF hearts have increased preischemic glycogen reserves, higher glycogen synthase protein levels, and significantly higher lactic acid release during ischemia. 6D-induced HIF hearts were also better able to maintain ATP levels during ischemia compared with WT and Non-I hearts. Interestingly, Non-I hearts showed no significant increase in glycogen reserves, glycolytic flux, or greater ATP preservation during ischemia and yet were protected to a similar extent as the 6D-induced hearts. Finally, the mitochondrial membrane potential of isolated adult myocytes was monitored during anoxia or treatments with cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose. HIF-1\u03b1 expression was shown to protect mitochondrial polarization during both stress treatments. Taken together these data indicate that, while HIF-1\u03b1 expression in heart does induce increases in compensatory glycolytic capacity, these changes are not necessarily required for cardioprotection, at least in this model of ischemic stress.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Genetic deletion of aquaporin-1 results in microcardia and low blood pressure in mouse with intact nitric oxide-dependent relaxation, but enhanced prostanoids-dependent relaxation.", "abstract": "The water channels, aquaporins (AQPs) are key mediators of transcellular fluid transport. However, their expression and role in cardiac tissue is poorly characterized. Particularly, AQP1 was suggested to transport other molecules (nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) with potential major bearing on cardiovascular physiology. We therefore examined the expression of all AQPs and the phenotype of AQP1 knockout mice (vs. wild-type littermates) under implanted telemetry in vivo, as well as endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated aortas and resistance vessels ex vivo. Four aquaporins were expressed in wild-type heart tissue (AQP1, AQP7, AQP4, AQP8) and two aquaporins in aortic and mesenteric vessels (AQP1-AQP7). AQP1 was expressed in endothelial as well as cardiac and vascular muscle cells and co-segregated with caveolin-1. AQP1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a prominent microcardia and decreased myocyte transverse dimensions despite no change in capillary density. Both male and female AQP1 KO mice had lower mean BP, which was not attributable to altered water balance or autonomic dysfunction (from baroreflex and frequency analysis of BP and HR variability). NO-dependent BP variability was unperturbed. Accordingly, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDH(F)) or NO-dependent relaxation were unchanged in aorta or resistance vessels ex vivo. However, AQP1 KO mesenteric vessels exhibited an increase in endothelial prostanoids-dependent relaxation, together with increased expression of COX-2. This enhanced relaxation was abrogated by COX inhibition. We conclude that AQP1 does not regulate the endothelial EDH or NO-dependent relaxation ex vivo or in vivo, but its deletion decreases baseline BP together with increased prostanoids-dependent relaxation in resistance vessels. Strikingly, this was associated with microcardia, unrelated to perturbed angiogenesis. This may raise interest for new inhibitors of AQP1 and their use to treat hypertrophic cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["VMontiel", "ELeon Gomez", "CBouzin", "HEsfahani", "MRomero Perez", "ILobysheva", "ODevuyst", "CDessy", "J LBalligand"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-013-1325-x"}
{"title": "Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["Walid HamdyEl-Tantawy"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-013-0277-0"}
{"title": "Autonomic cardiac innervation: development and adult plasticity.", "abstract": "Autonomic cardiac neurons have a common origin in the neural crest but undergo distinct developmental differentiation as they mature toward their adult phenotype. Progenitor cells respond to repulsive cues during migration, followed by differentiation cues from paracrine sources that promote neurochemistry and differentiation. When autonomic axons start to innervate cardiac tissue, neurotrophic factors from vascular tissue are essential for maintenance of neurons before they reach their targets, upon which target-derived trophic factors take over final maturation, synaptic strength and postnatal survival. Although target-derived neurotrophins have a central role to play in development, alternative sources of neurotrophins may also modulate innervation. Both developing and adult sympathetic neurons express proNGF, and adult parasympathetic cardiac ganglion neurons also synthesize and release NGF. The physiological function of these \"non-classical\" cardiac sources of neurotrophins remains to be determined, especially in relation to autocrine/paracrine sustenance during development. \u00a0 Cardiac autonomic nerves are closely spatially associated in cardiac plexuses, ganglia and pacemaker regions and so are sensitive to release of neurotransmitter, neuropeptides and trophic factors from adjacent nerves. As such, in many cardiac pathologies, it is an imbalance within the two arms of the autonomic system that is critical for disease progression. Although this crosstalk between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves has been well established for adult nerves, it is unclear whether a degree of paracrine regulation occurs across the autonomic limbs during development. Aberrant nerve remodeling is a common occurrence in many adult cardiovascular pathologies, and the mechanisms regulating outgrowth or denervation are disparate. However, autonomic neurons display considerable plasticity in this regard with neurotrophins and inflammatory cytokines having a central regulatory function, including in possible neurotransmitter changes. Certainly, neurotrophins and cytokines regulate transcriptional factors in adult autonomic neurons that have vital differentiation roles in development. Particularly for parasympathetic cardiac ganglion neurons, additional examinations of developmental regulatory mechanisms will potentially aid in understanding attenuated parasympathetic function in a

Previously, we showed that endothelium-targeted adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer of the human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (h15-LO-1) enhances arterial relaxation through the production of vasodilatory hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acid (HEETA) and trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (THETA) metabolites. To further define this function, a transgenic (Tg) mouse line that overexpresses h15-LO-1 was studied. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR results confirmed expression of 15-LO-1 transgene in tissues, especially high quantity in coronary arterial wall, of Tg mice. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of [(14)C]-AA metabolites in heart tissues revealed enhanced 15-HETE synthesis in Tg vs. WT mice. Among the 15-LO-1 metabolites, 15-HETE, erythro-13-H-14,15-EETA, and 11(R),12(S),15(S)-THETA relaxed the mouse mesenteric arteries to the greatest extent. The presence of h15-LO-1 increased acetylcholine- and AA-mediated relaxation in mesenteric arteries of Tg mice compared to WT mice. 15-LO-1 was most abundant in the heart; therefore, we used the Langendorff heart model to test the hypothesis that elevated 15-LO-1 levels would increase coronary flow following a short ischemia episode. Both peak flow and excess flow of reperfused hearts were significantly elevated in hearts from Tg compared to WT mice being 2.03 and 3.22 times greater, respectively. These results indicate that h15-LO-1-derived metabolites are highly vasoactive and may play a critical role in regulating coronary blood flow.", "journal": "Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["TamasKriska", "CodyCepura", "LawanSiangjong", "Tina CWan", "John AAuchampach", "AvivShaish", "DrorHaratz", "GaneshKumar", "John RFalck", "Kathryn MGauthier", "William BCampbell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2013.07.002"}

{"title": "Discovery and characterization of miRNA genes in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by use of a deep sequencing approach.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of endogenous small RNA molecules that downregulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. They play important roles in multiple biological processes by regulating genes that control developmental timing, growth, stem cell division and apoptosis by binding to the mRNA of target genes. Despite the position Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has as an economically important domesticated animal, there has been little research on miRNAs in this species. Knowledge about miRNAs and their target genes may be used to control health and to improve performance of economically important traits. However, before their biological function can be unravelled they must be identified and annotated. The aims of this study were to identify and characterize miRNA genes in Atlantic salmon by deep sequencing analysis of small RNA libraries from nine different tissues.\nA total of 180 distinct mature miRNAs belonging to 106 families of evolutionary conserved miRNAs, and 13 distinct novel mature miRNAs were discovered and characterized. The mature miRNAs corresponded to 521 putative precursor sequences located at unique genome locations. About 40% of these precursors were part of gene clusters, and the majority of the Salmo salar gene clusters discovered were conserved across species. Comparison of expression levels in samples from different tissues applying DESeq indicated that there were tissue specific expression differences in three conserved and one novel miRNA. Ssa-miR 736 was detected in heart tissue only, while two other clustered miRNAs (ssa-miR 212 and132) seems to be at a higher expression level in brain tissue. These observations correlate well with their expected functions as regulators of signal pathways in cardiac and neuronal cells, respectively. Ssa-miR 8163 is one of the novel miRNAs discovered and its function remains unknown. However, differential expression analysis using DESeq suggests that this miRNA is enriched in liver tissue and the precursor was mapped to intron 7 of the transferrin gene.\nThe identification and annotation of evolutionary conserved and novel Salmo salar miRNAs as well as the characterization of miRNA gene clusters provide biological knowledge that will greatly facilitate further functional studies on miRNAs in this species.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2013-07-20", "authors": ["RuneAndreassen", "Merete MoltonWorren", "Bj\u00f8rnH\u00f8yheim"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-14-482\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00045-5\n10.1016/j.ceb.2009.04.009\n10.1038/ncb0309-228\n10.1093/nar/gkj112\n10.1038/35040556\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.23.090506.123406\n10.1038/nrg1379\n10.1038/nrm2347\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.12.035\n10.1093/nar/gkn714\n10.1038/ng1810\n10.1093/bib/bbp019\n10.1038/nbt1394\n10.1186/1471-2164-11-4\n10.1093/nar/gks043\n10.1186/1471-2164-10-502\n10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.006\n10.1073/pnas.75.11.5575\n10.1016/j.tree.2005.04.008\n10.1073/pnas.0712259105\n10.1093/nar/gkr688\n10.1261/rna.2183803\n10.1038/nrg2179\n10.1101/gad.1310605\n10.1093/nar/gkq1027\n10.1002/wsbm.111\n10.1073/pnas.242606799\n10.1084/jem.20100458\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.05.017\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.01.005\n10.1073/pnas.0508448102\n10.1046/j.1365-294x.1999.00651.x\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106"}

Subsequently, the bioactivity of released peptide and its effects on human cardiac fibroblast (HCF) were explored. We achieved sustained release from three films with low, intermediate and high release profiles for 30 days. Moreover, the bioactivity of released peptide was verified from the elevated production of cyclic guanosine monophospate (cGMP). The CD-NP released from films was able to inhibit the proliferation of hypertrophic HCF as well as suppress DNA synthesis in HCF. Furthermore, the sustained delivery from films showed comparable or superior suppressive actions on hypertrophic HCF compared to daily infusion of CD-NP.

{"title": "Induction of human cardiomyocyte-like cells from fibroblasts by defined factors.", "abstract": "Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Owing to the limited regenerative capacity of heart tissue, cardiac regenerative therapy has emerged as an attractive approach. Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. In the present study, we sought to determine whether human fibroblasts also could be converted to iCMs by defined factors. Our initial finding that GMT was not sufficient for cardiac induction in HCFs prompted us to screen for additional factors to promote cardiac reprogramming by analyzing multiple cardiac-specific gene induction with quantitative RT-PCR. The addition of Mesp1 and Myocd to GMT up-regulated a broader spectrum of cardiac genes in HCFs more efficiently compared with GMT alone. The HCFs and human dermal fibroblasts transduced with GMT, Mesp1, and Myocd (GMTMM) changed the cell morphology from a spindle shape to a rod-like or polygonal shape, expressed multiple cardiac-specific proteins, increased a broad range of cardiac genes and concomitantly suppressed fibroblast genes, and exhibited spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations.

These perturbations may alter the trajectory of spiral wave drift in the heart muscle. We investigate the effect of spatially extended inhomogeneity of transverse cell coupling on the spiral wave trajectory using a simple active media model. The spiral wave was either attracted or repelled from the center of inhomogeneity as a function of cell excitability and gradient of the cell coupling. High levels of excitability resulted in an attraction of the wave to the center of inhomogeneity, whereas low levels resulted in an escape and termination of the spiral wave. The spiral wave drift velocity was related to the gradient of the coupling and the initial position of the wave. In a diseased heart, a region of altered transverse coupling corresponds with local gap junction remodeling that may be responsible for stabilization-destabilization of spiral waves and hence reflect potentially important targets in the treatment of heart arrhythmias.", "journal": "Journal of biological physics", "date": "2013-07-19", "authors": ["PawelKuklik", "PrashanthanSanders", "LukaszSzumowski", "Jan J\u017bebrowski"], "doi": "10.1007/s10867-012-9286-4\n10.1063/1.166374\n10.1161/01.RES.74.6.1065\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01443-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.5.1742\n10.1103/PhysRevE.72.046204\n10.1063/1.165844\n10.1046/j.1540.8167.90318.x\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.02.001\n10.1016/0167-2789(95)00256-1\n10.1063/1.1947427\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.058101\n10.1103/PhysRevE.79.026220\n10.1063/1.166286\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.07.005\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.016107\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.011929\n10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4943\n10.1016/0167-2789(94)90054-X\n10.2174/1568006033337276\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01290.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.598631\n10.1016/0167-2789(95)00059-D\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76821-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018052\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.481\n10.1016/j.physleta.2004.03.080\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2006.00382.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2594(199908)42:2<393::AID-MRM22>3.0.CO;2-F\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00226-2\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1781\n10.1161/01.RES.44.5.701\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3854\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.168303\n10.1063/1.3263167\n10.1098/rsta.2010.0038\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.015"}
{"title": "Prothymosin alpha protects cardiomyocytes against ischemia-induced apoptosis via preservation of Akt activation.", "abstract": "The human prothymosin alpha (PT\u03b1) gene encodes a 12.5\u00a0kDa highly acidic nuclear protein that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues including the heart and importantly, is detectable also in blood serum. During apoptosis or necrosis, PT\u03b1 changes its nuclear localization and is able to exert an important cytoprotective effect. Since the role of PT\u03b1 in the heart has never been evaluated, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PT\u03b1 on cardiomyocytes during ischemic injury. Our data show that seven after myocardial infarction (MI), PT\u03b1 expression levels are significantly increased both in blood serum and in cardiac tissue, and notably we observe that PT\u03b1 translocates from the nuclei to cytoplasm and plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes following MI. Furthermore, in vitro experiments in cardiomyocytes, confirm that after 6\u00a0h of simulated ischemia (SI), PT\u03b1 protein levels are upregulated compared to normoxic cells. Importantly, treatment of cardiomyocytes with a recombinant PT\u03b1 (rPT\u03b1), during SI results in a significant decrease in the apoptotic response and in a robust increase in cell survival. Moreover, these effects are accompanied to a significant preservation of the activated levels of the anti-apoptotic serine-threonine kinase Akt. Consistent with our in vitro observation, rPT\u03b1-treated MI mice exhibit a strong reduction in infarct size at 24\u00a0h, compared to the MI control group and at the molecular level, PT\u03b1 treatment induces activation of Akt.

Recently, we successfully detected \u03b1-Gal epitopes as well as Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antigens from the N-glycans in the pig heart tissues, which have been considered as promising non-Gal antigens. However, the profiling of O-glycan from pig heart tissues had not been performed owing to the difficulty of O-glycan preparation.\nIn this study, we established the simple and sensitive method to profile O-glycans from pig heart aortic valve, aortic wall, pulmonary valve, pulmonary wall, and cardiac muscle tissues. To liberate O-glycans from the pig heart tissues, we used non-reductive \u03b2-elimination reagent and subsequently purified the glycans. After permethylation, the glycans were qualitatively analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).\nThe comprehensive O-glycan analysis method was successfully validated using model glycoproteins such as bovine serum fetuin (BSF) and bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM) glycoproteins, and their O-glycan profiles were in accordance with the data of previous studies. Next, we applied the method for O-glycan release and characterization to analysis of various pig heart tissues. As a result, total 39, 33, 24, 36, and 25 of O-glycans were detected from aortic valve, aortic wall, pulmonary valve, pulmonary wall, and cardiac muscle, respectively. Furthermore, four in aortic valve, one in aortic wall, one in pulmonary valve, one in pulmonary wall, and one in cardiac muscle were particularly determined as terminally N-glycolylneuraminic acid-linked O-glycans, which is considered to be the H-D antigens.\nHere, we initially described the O-glycan structures of various pig heart tissues, and additionally, the existence of H-D antigen type O-glycans was firstly identified.

Using SD rats as donors and Wistar rats as recipients, animals were divided into two groups, control and cyclosporine A intervention plus heart transplant groups. After transplant at 1, 3, 7, 10 and 12d, we assessed the ability of lymphocytes to infiltrate into cardiac tissues and levels of leukocyte coding genes in peripheral blood. Histopathological changes were monitored in cardiac tissue to determine the level of transplant rejection.\n(1) 24h after transplant peripheral blood lymphocytes' transcription and expression were temporarily reduced. (2) CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes infiltrate into cardiac tissue and Grade 1R pathological changes were observed 3d-7d after heart transplant. (3)Cyclosporine A was not able to completely block heart transplant rejection.(4) Although cyclosporine A was not able to effectively suppress CD4(+) T cell gene expression, it did suppress CD8(+) T cell gene transcription. (5) Cyclosporine A did not effectively reduce the rapid infiltration of CD4(+) or CD8(+) infiltration in 3d, but significantly reduced the degree of CD4(+) T cell infiltration in cardiac tissues between 3 and 7d.

Cyclosporine A group: there were differences in thrombospondin-1, TCR, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, sodium channel beta-1, gig18 and TCR. In the cyclosporine A group 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate positive expression was observed 24h after the control group, which indicates that cyclosporine A slowed down the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate transcription rate in peripheral lymphocytes and delayed its expression time. Cyclosporine A also suppressed gig18 transcription in peripheral lymphocytes. After 24h, sodium channel beta-1 was positively expressed in the cyclosporine A group.

Subsequently, preexposure to PM(2.5) induced a slight increase of IFN-\u03b3 in the sera of CVB3-infected mice.\nThese results demonstrated that PM(2.5) exposure exacerbated virus-induced myocarditis possibly through the increase in Th17-mediated viral replication, perforin response and imbalance of MMP-2/TIMP-1.

Renal and cardiac functions in both sexes were deteriorated following acute renal I/R injury proved by the increase in serum urea, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels. These cardiac lesions are mainly due to the oxidative stress response in the form of the increase in cardiac tissue lipid peroxide, and the decrease in cardiac tissue glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels.

Mitochondria were rapidly isolated from fresh atrial tissue samples obtained from 14 patients undergoing Maze surgery due to atrial fibrillation. Human heart mitochondria exhibited typical mPT characteristics upon calcium overload such as swelling, evaluated by changes in light scattering, inhibition of respiration and loss of respiratory coupling. Swelling was a morphologically reversible event following transient calcium challenge. Calcium retention capacity (CRC), a quantitative measure of mPT sensitivity assayed by following extramitochondrial [Ca(2+)] and changes in respiration during a continuous calcium infusion, was significantly increased by cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitors. The thiol-reactive oxidant phenylarsine oxide sensitized mitochondria to calcium-induced mPT. Release of the pro-apoptotic intermembrane protein cytochrome c was increased after, but not before, calcium discharge and respiratory inhibition in the CRC assay.

However, the protective effect of ACEi in early stages of this specific injury remains elusive. Activated nuclear transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) regulate cellular metabolism, but their involvement in anthracycline cardiomyopathy has not been investigated yet.

Control animals received vehicle. Left ventricular function was measured invasively under anesthesia. Cell-shortening was measured by videomicroscopy in isolated cardiomyocytes. Expression of PPARs mRNA in cardiac tissue was measured by Real-Time PCR. Although the hemodynamic parameters of daunorubicin-treated rats remained altered upon ACEi co-administration, ACEi normalized daunorubicin-induced QT prolongation. On cellular level, ACEi normalized altered basal and isoproterenol-stimulated cardiac cell shortening in daunorubicine-treated group. Moreover, anthracycline administration significantly up-regulated heart PPAR\u03b1 mRNA and its expression remained increased after ACEi co-administration. On the other hand, the expression of cardiac PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 was not altered in anthracycline-treated animals, whereas co-administration of ACEi increased its expression.

{"title": "Mineralocorticoid receptors and the heart, multiple cell types and multiple mechanisms: a focus on the cardiomyocyte.", "abstract": "MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) activation in the heart plays a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. The MR is present in many cell types within the myocardium, including cardiomyocytes, macrophages and the coronary vasculature. The specific role of the MR in each of these cell types in the initiation and progression of cardiac pathophysiology is not fully understood. Cardiomyocyte MRs are increasingly recognized to play a role in regulating cardiac function, electrical conduction and fibrosis, through direct signal mediation and through paracrine MR-dependent activity. Although MR blockade in the heart is an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of heart failure and other forms of heart disease, current antagonists are limited by side effects owing to MR inactivation in other tissues (including renal targets). This has led to increased efforts to develop therapeutics that are more selective for cardiac MRs and which may have reduced the occurrence of side effects in non-cardiac tissues. A major clinical consideration in the treatment of cardiovascular disease is of the differences between males and females in the incidence and outcomes of cardiac events. There is clinical evidence that female sensitivity to endogenous MRs is more pronounced, and experimentally that MR-targeted interventions may be more efficacious in females. Given that sex differences have been described in MR signalling in a range of experimental settings and that the MR and oestrogen receptor pathways share some common signalling intermediates, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the mechanisms of MRs need to be evaluated in a sex-selective manner.

Thus, \u03b8 is closely related to the maximum rate of action potential (AP) depolarization [(dV/dt)max], as determined by the fast Na(+) current (I Na); the axial resistance (r a) to local circuit current flow between cells; their membrane capacitances (c m); and to the geometrical relationship between successive myocytes within cardiac tissue. These determinants are altered by a wide range of pathophysiological conditions. Firstly, I Na is reduced by the impaired Na(+) channel function that arises clinically during heart failure, ischemia, tachycardia, and following treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Such reductions also arise as a consequence of mutations in SCN5A such as those occurring in Len\u00e8gre disease, Brugada syndrome (BrS), sick sinus syndrome, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Secondly, r a, may be increased due to gap junction decoupling following ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure, or as a result of mutations in CJA5 found in idiopathic AF and atrial standstill. Finally, either r a or c m could potentially be altered by fibrotic change through the resultant decoupling of myocyte-myocyte connections and coupling of myocytes with fibroblasts. Such changes are observed in myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy or following mutations in MHC403 and SCN5A resulting in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or Len\u00e8gre disease, respectively. This review defines and quantifies the determinants of \u03b8 and summarizes experimental evidence that links changes in these determinants with reduced myocardial \u03b8 and arrhythmogenesis. It thereby identifies the diverse pathophysiological conditions in which abnormal \u03b8 may contribute to arrhythmia.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2013-07-05", "authors": ["James HKing", "Christopher L-HHuang", "James AFraser"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2013.00154\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.07.019\n10.1007/s00232-012-9466-y\n10.1161/01.RES.0000152325.07495.5a\n10.1093/cvr/cvp324\n10.1161/01.RES.0000144125.61927.1c\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.3.1024\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.06.021\n10.1196/annals.1380.007\n10.1161/01.RES.87.8.656\n10.1161/01.RES.77.4.813\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1023/A:1009700404218\n10.1083/jcb.105.6.2621\n10.1056/NEJM199505183322002\n10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80411-X\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.183400\n10.1161/01.RES.0000122382.19400.14\n10.1093/cvr/cvn274\n10.1074/jbc.M807747200\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.135038\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.12.3083\n10.1161/01.RES.80.6.765\n10.1161/01.RES.82.2.232\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.532614\n10.1161/01.RES.79.2.174\n10.1016/S0027-5107(01)00160-9\n10.1016/0735-1097(94)90879-6\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00222-X\n10.1038/nrd3682\n10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00317-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.55.3.455\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1308\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.09.015\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.11.2953\n10.1161/01.RES.0000141134.64811.0a\n10.1085/jgp.201110617\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.10.023\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00045.x\n10.1161/01.RES.81.6.1045\n10.1161/01.RES.32.5.625\n10.1056/NEJMoa052800\n10.1172/JCI119367\n10.1038/nature07039\n10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00528-2\n10.1161/01.RES.88.3.333\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.08.007\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.960807\n10.1159/000092579\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.937029\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00645.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.11.025\n10.1161/01.RES.86.12.1193\n10.1097/00005344-198903000-00017\n10.1017/S0958067099017947\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.7.651\n10.1093/cvr/cvt141\n10.1161/01.RES.87.5.399\n10.1016/S0960-9822(98)70114-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.73.1.189\n10.1016/S0022-2828(84)80591-X\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.4.1665\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.010\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00273-0\n10.1161/01.RES.83.8.795\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81282-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.6.675\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2006.00411.x\n10.1083/jcb.149.7.1503\n10.1016/S0022-2143(03)00060-X\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.168997\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.5.547\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.07.016\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.054\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046452.67724.B8\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.2.194\n10.1161/01.RES.85.11.1046\n10.1161/01.RES.26.2.135\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1016/S0002-9149(02)03403-3\n10.1016/j.pcad.2005.06.002\n10.1016/0896-6273(89)90190-6\n10.1161/01.RES.0000035854.11082.01\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01443-7\n10.1085/jgp.108.5.375\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.653949\n10.1007/s00232-012-9465-z\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.12.005\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035\n10.1007/s10439-009-9667-4\n10.1097/00005344-200406000-00015\n10.1038/12618\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.10.3051\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01962-9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.163956\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1997.tb06199.x\n10.1161/01.RES.62.4.811\n10.1161/01.RES.86.3.302\n10.1161/01.RES.50.2.175\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00294-7\n10.1038/35059090\n10.1172/JCI115313\n10.1161/01.RES.0000074916.41221.EA\n10.1161/01.RES.85.8.672\n10.1074/jbc.M102548200\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2000.01262.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00940.x\n10.1007/BF02110109\n10.1161/01.RES.60.1.93\n10.1161/01.RES.0000129579.59664.9d\n10.1172/JCI26620\n10.1172/JCI46315\n10.1006/geno.1996.0236\n10.1006/jmcc.1994.1036\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.565804\n10.1038/nsmb737\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00279-1\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.03276.x\n10.1161/01.RES.71.2.460\n10.1161/01.RES.84.7.776\n10.1161/01.RES.87.4.316"}
{"title": "The Expression of the fim Operon Is Crucial for the Survival of Streptococcus parasanguinis FW213 within Macrophages but Not Acid Tolerance.", "abstract": "The acquisition of transition metal ions is essential for the viability and in some cases the expression of virulence genes in bacteria. The fimCBA operon of Streptococcus parasanguinis FW213 encodes a Mn(2+)/Fe(2+)-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter. FimA, a lipoprotein in the system, is essential for the development of endocarditis, presumably by binding to fibrin monolayers on the damaged heart tissue. Recent sequence analysis revealed that Spaf_0344 was homologous to Streptococcus gordonii scaR, encoding a metalloregulatory protein for the Sca Mn(2+)-specific transporter. Based on the homology, Spaf_0344 was designated fimR. By using various fim promoter (p fim ) derivatives fused with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, the functions of the cis-elements of p fim were analyzed in the wild-type and fimR-deficient hosts. The result indicated that FimR represses the expression of p fim and the palindromic sequences 5' to fimC are involved in repression of p fim . A direct interaction between FimR and the palindromic sequences was further confirmed by in vitro electrophoresis gel mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)-quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The result of the ChIP-qPCR analysis also indicated that FimR is activated by Mn(2+) and, to a lesser degree, Fe(2+). Functional analysis indicated that the expression of FimA in S. parasanguinis was critical for wild-type levels of survival against oxidative stress and within phagocytes, but not for acid tolerance. Taken together, in addition to acting as an adhesin (FimA), the expression of the fim operon is critical for the pathogenic capacity of S. parasanguinis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-07-05", "authors": ["Yi-Ywan MChen", "Hui-RuShieh", "Ya-ChingChang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066163"}
{"title": "[Effect of hydrogen sulfide donor NaHs on the functional state of the respiratory chain of the rat heart mitochondria].", "abstract": "In experiments on mitochondria isolated from the heart tissue of adult rats we studied the effects of a donor of hydrogen sulfide, NaHS, on the respiratory chain of the organelles. We found that NaHS (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/l) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption in the presence of succinate and ADP (state 3 to Chance), and in the absence of ADP (state 4). The decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption in a concentration NaHS 10(-9) mol/l and 10(-8) mol/l associated with an increased conjugation of oxidation and phosphorylation, as evidenced by the increase in the respiratory control, the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (ADP/O) is not changed. Our studies suggest a protective effect of hydrogen sulfide donor on the functional state of the mitochondria. To elucidate of other the mechanisms of the protective action H2S we also investigated the effect of hydrogen sulfide donor on the mitochondrial swelling. It was found that NaHS in the range of concentration 10(-12) - 10(-4) mol/l influences the level of mitochondria swelling of the rats heart in the dose-dependent manner. It was also shown that when the concentration of Ca2+ 1 nmol/mg protein in the medium, under the action of hydrogen sulfide in the donor concentration range 10(-12) - 10(-8) mol/l, there was a moderate swelling of rats heart mitochondria. Under the action of NaHS at a concentration of 10(-9) mol/l it was observed swelling of the mitochondria, the maximum change in the level of which was 11%. Inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channels) 5-hydroxydecanoate (10(-4) mol/l) partially reduced the mitochondrial swelling in the presence of NaHS (10(-9) mol/l), which may indicate the activation of K(ATP) channels.

Transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells has the potential to alleviate heart disease. Since the initial derivation of human embryonic stem cells, significant progress has been made in the generation and characterization of enriched cardiomyocytes and the demonstration of the ability of these cardiomyocytes to survive, integrate, and function in animal models. The scope of therapeutic potential from pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has been further expanded with the invention of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be induced to generate functional cardiomyocytes for regenerative cardiac therapy in a patient specific manner. The reprogramming technology has also inspired the recent discovery of direct conversion of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells, which may allow endogenous cardiac repair.

{"title": "Myocardial ER chaperone activation and protein degradation occurs due to synergistic, not individual, cold and hypoxic stress.", "abstract": "Environmental stress at high altitude affects the myocardium at the physiological and molecular level. Characterized by hypobaric hypoxia and low temperatures, the cumulative impact of these stressors on the protein folding homeostasis in the heart is yet unexplored. The present study evaluates the collective effect of cold and hypoxia on the myocardial protein oxidation and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Adult rats were exposed to either a singular acute stress of cold (10 \u00b0C; C), hypobaric hypoxia (7620 m; H) or simultaneously to both cold and hypobaric hypoxia (CH) for 6 h. Hypoxic stress amplified the free radical generation in H and CH groups, leading to enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Coupled to cold stress, reduced oxygen availability caused substantial protein oxidative modifications, as well as cardiac tissue injury and matrix remodeling, evident in the histological staining. Presence of oxidized proteins caused a significant upregulation in expression of ER chaperones GRP78 and PDI in the cold hypoxia exposed animals. Enhanced proteolytic activity signaled the removal of misfolded proteins. Linked intricately to cellular stress response, cell survival kinases were expressed higher in CH group; however apoptotic CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) expression remained unaltered. Administration of ER stress inducer, tunicamycin along with cold hypoxic stress, caused a discernible increase in protein oxidation and GRP78 expression, along with a significant elevation in proteasome and apoptotic activity.

Male Wistar rats were divided in 3 groups (n=7/each) and treated for 30 days: only L-NAME-treated (60 mg/kg/day by oral gavage), L-NAME+resveratrol (L-NAME+R) and L-NAME+grape juice (L-NAME+G). BP signal was directly recorded and pulse interval (PI) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability were analyzed in time and frequency domains. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was determined by the alpha index. Oxidized and reduced glutathione concentrations were determined in cardiac tissue. L-NAME increased BP with no differences among groups (mean BP: L-NAME=124\u00b14, L-NAME+R=126\u00b13 and L-NAME+G=125\u00b14 mmHg). PI and SAP variability expressed by total variance were also similar among groups. However, normalized low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components of PI variability were lower and higher, respectively, in both R and G-treated groups when compared to only L-NAME group.

Retrospective data was obtained from a total of 80 patients: 29 patients with a normal echocardiogram, and 51 intensive care unit patients; 28 septic and 23 with heart failure. The mean TD peak systolic velocity (Sm) was significantly lower in the heart failure patients (P <0.05) compared to both normal and septic group. The mean CO was significantly higher in septic patients when compared to heart failure patients. A mild to moderate positive correlation was found between Sm and CO in the heart failure group and with all patients combined (r2=0.19, P <0.001). Subsequent analysis of Sm versus stroke volume again showed a mild positive correlation in the heart failure group and combined results (r2=0.18, P <0.001). Sm was weakly correlated to heart rate only in the normal group but not in the combined cohort.

Administration of doxorubicin to male mice leads to an increase in the level of urea and creatinine, as well as activation of ALT in blood plasma. Introduction of NSE resulted in normalization of these parameters to the level of intact animals. In the heart tissue doxorubicin has multidirectional effects on the activity of antioxidant enzymes, in particular it decreases the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase activity increases. Introduction of NSE normalizes these two indicators. It was found that tumor growth leads to an increase in the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Introduction of NSE normalizes activity of these enzymes. Doxorubicin causes an increase in catalase activity in the kidney of mice with tumour, NSE prevented the increase in the activity of the above enzyme. The cancer process leads to increased levels of catalase activity in the liver of tumour-bearing mice, the introduction of NSE decreases the enzyme activity.", "journal": "Ukrains'kyi biokhimichnyi zhurnal (1999 )", "date": "2013-07-03", "authors": ["Ie AHudz'", "N MHula", "T MHorid'ko", "Iu MBashta", "A IVoie\u012dkov"], "doi": null}

The promising cardioprotective effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) protein in animal experiments have not been consistently reproduced in clinical human trials of acute MI; however, the mechanisms underlying the inconsistent discrepancies are not yet fully understood. We hypothesized that the plasmid human erythropoietin gene (phEPO) delivered by our bioreducible polymer might produce cardioprotective effects on post-infarct cardiac remodeling. We demonstrated that intramyocardial delivery of phEPO by an arginine-grafted poly(disulfide amine) (ABP) polymer in infarcted rats preserves cardiac geometry and systolic function. The reduced infarct size of phEPO/ABP delivery was followed by decrease in fibrosis, protection from cardiomyocyte loss, and down-regulation of apoptotic activity. In addition, the increased angiogenesis and decreased myofibroblast density in the border zone of the infarct support the beneficial effects of phEPO/ABP administration. Furthermore, phEPO/ABP delivery induced prominent suppression on Ang II and TGF-\u03b2 activity in all subdivisions of cardiac tissues except for the central zone of infarct.

Occlusion of a coronary artery produces ischemia and myocardial necrosis that leads to left ventricular (LV) remodeling, dysfunction, and heart failure. Stem cell therapy may decrease infarct size and improve LV function; the hypoxic environment, however, following a myocardial infarction may result in apoptosis, which in turn decreases survival of transplanted stem cells. Therefore, the effects of preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with hyperoxia (100% oxygen), Z-VAD-FMK pan-caspase inhibitor (CI), or both in a hypoxic environment in order to mimic conditions seen in cardiac tissue post-myocardial infarction were studied in vitro. MSCs preconditioned with hyperoxia or CI significantly decreased apoptosis as suggested by TUNEL assay and Annexin V analysis using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. These effects were more profound when both, hyperoxia and CI, were used. Additionally, gene and protein expression of caspases 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 were down-regulated significantly in MSCs preconditioned with hyperoxia, CI, or both, while the survival markers Akt1, NF-\u03baB, and Bcl-2 were significantly increased in preconditioned MSCs. These changes ultimately resulted in a significant increase in MSC proliferation in hypoxic environment as determined by BrdU assays compared to MSCs without preconditioning.

The reduction of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in cardiac tissue induces myocyte death and cardiac dysfunction, leading to the development of myocardial dilation in animal models; this has also been documented in patients with heart failure (HF). During several pathological situations (cardiac insufficiency and HF) and in experimental models (obesity), the heart becomes more sensitive to the effect of cardiac glycosides, due to a decrease in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase levels. The primary female sex steroid estradiol has long been recognized to be important in a wide variety of physiological processes. Numerous studies, including ours, have shown that estradiol is one of the major factors controlling the activity and expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the cardiovascular (CV) system. However, the effects of estradiol on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in both normal and pathological conditions, such as obesity, remain unclear. Increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which estradiol mediates its effects on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase function may help to develop new strategies for the treatment of CV diseases.

It is of great significance to explore novel treatments to reverse cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensives with or without affecting blood pressure. In the present study, we investigated whether low-dose resveratrol alone or in a combination with a blood pressure-lowering agent can reverse hypertension-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Twenty-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with resveratrol (2.5 mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9 per day) and/or hydralazine (25 mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9 per day) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, cardiac structure and function, and electrocardiogram measurements were examined. Pressure myography of resistance arteries, histological examinations of heart tissues, oxidative stress and inflammatory measurements were also preformed to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Although resveratrol treatment alone was ineffective in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, diastolic dysfunction and vascular remodeling, it significantly prevented the systolic impairment and reduced myocardial fibrosis, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertensive rats. Furthermore, a combination of resveratrol with hydralazine treatment significantly reduced blood pressure, improved systolic and diastolic function, decreased fibrosis and improved vascular geometry. In summary, low-dose resveratrol itself was unable to reduce systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, diastolic dysfunction and vascular remodeling. However, resveratrol alone alleviated cardiac fibrosis and some of the functional abnormalities in SHRs.

Anisotropy is determined by orientation of myocardial fibres. Determining fibre orientation field and shape of the heart is important for anatomically accurate modelling of electrical and mechanical function of the heart. The aim of this paper is to introduce a theoretical rule-based model for anatomy and fibre orientation of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart and to compare it with experimental data. We suggest explicit analytical formulae that allow us to obtain the left ventricle form and its fibre direction field. The ventricle band concept of cardiac architecture given by Torrent-Guasp is chosen as the model postulate.\nIn our approach, anisotropy of the heart is derived from some general principles. The LV is considered as a set of identical spiral surfaces, each of which can be produced from the other by rotation around one vertical axis. Each spiral surface is filled with non-intersecting curves which represent myocardial fibres.For model verification, we use experimental data on fibre orientation in human and canine hearts.\nLV shape and anisotropy are represented by explicit analytical expressions in a curvilinear 3-D coordinate system. The derived fibre orientation field shows good qualitative agreement with experimental data. The model reveals the most thorough quantitative simulation of fibre angles at the LV middle zone.\nOur analysis shows that the band concept can generate realistic anisotropy of the LV.

This study aimed to investigate whether the selective 5-LOX inhibitor 11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (11-keto BA), in three different dose levels, exert a protective effect on myocardial I/R injury in an in vivo rat heart model. Sixty male Wister rats were used in this study and divided into five equal groups (n=12): GP1, sham-operated receiving normal saline; Gp 2, rats were subjected to 45 min left anterior descending coronary artery ligation followed by 4 h reperfusion to serve as I/R group. Gps 3-5 received 11-keto BA in doses 250, 500, 1,000 mg/kg, respectively, via an oral gavage for 7 days then were exposed to I/R. I/R injury induced a significant elevation in myeloperoxidase activity and gene expression of intracellular adhesion molecules, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-lipooxygenasae, nuclear factor kappa-beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, and hemeoxygenease-1 consequently with reduction in glutathione peroxidase in heart tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemical examination of the heart tissues showed positive immuostaining for both 3-nitrotyrosine and caspase-3 with DNA-ladder formation in all diseased rats. 11-keto BA in three dose levels exerted dose dependent cardioprotective effect manifested by dose-dependent reduction in serum lactate dehydrogenase and infract size through mechanisms related to enhancement of antioxidant capacity and prevention of inflammatory cascades.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["Shimaa MElshazly", "Dalia MAbd El Motteleb", "Noha NNassar"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-013-0885-9"}

Nilotinib, a small-molecule Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was reported to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transmembrane transporters. The present study aimed to investigate nilotinib's affection on the steady-state pharmacokinetics, disposition and cardiotoxicity of DOX. A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (6 in each) and received the following regimens: saline, intravenous DOX (5mg/kg) alone, and DOX co-administrated with either 20 or 40mg/kg nilotinib. Blood was withdrawn at 12 time points till 72h after DOX injection and the concentrations of DOX and its metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol) in serum and cardiac tissue were assayed by LC-MS-MS method. To determine the cardiotoxicity, the following parameters were investigated: creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase. Histopathological examination of heart section was carried out to evaluate the extent of cardiotoxicity after treatments. The results showed that pretreatment of 40mg/kg nilotinib increased the AUC0-t and Cmax of DOX and DOXol. However, their accumulation in cardiac tissue was significantly decreased when compared with the group that received DOX alone. In addition, biochemical and histopathological results showed that 40mg/kg nilotinib reduced the cardiotoxicity induced by DOX administration. In conclusion, co-administration of nilotinib increased serum exposure, but significantly decreased the accumulation of DOX in cardiac tissue. Consistent with in vitro profile, oral dose of 40mg/kg nilotinib significantly decreased the cardiotoxicity of DOX in rat by enhancing P-gp activity in the heart.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["Zhi-YongZhou", "Li-LiWan", "Quan-JunYang", "Yong-LongHan", "YanLi", "QiYu", "ChengGuo", "XiaoLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.002"}

Whether these effects are different in the setting of obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) requires investigation. We examined the cardiometabolic actions of GLP-1 (7-36) in lean and obese/T2DM humans, and in lean and obese Ossabaw swine. GLP-1 significantly augmented myocardial glucose uptake under resting conditions in lean humans, but this effect was impaired in T2DM. This observation was confirmed and extended in swine, where GLP-1 effects to augment myocardial glucose uptake during exercise were seen in lean but not in obese swine. GLP-1 did not increase myocardial oxygen consumption or blood flow in humans or in swine. Impaired myocardial responsiveness to GLP-1 in obesity was not associated with any apparent alterations in myocardial or coronary GLP1-R expression. No evidence for GLP-1-mediated activation of cAMP/PKA or AMPK signaling in lean or obese hearts was observed. GLP-1 treatment augmented p38-MAPK activity in lean, but not obese cardiac tissue.

Ischemia after myocardial infarction (MI) and interaction of MSCs with their niche is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS hinder cell adhesion and induce detachment of cells, which induces anoikis signals in implanted MSCs. Therefore, strategies to regulate oxidative stress following the implantation of MSCs are therapeutically attractive.

However, the role of insulin in the regulation of the muscle atrophy-related Ub-ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1 as well as in autophagy, a major adaptive response to nutritional stress, in the heart has not been characterized. We report here that acute insulin deficiency in the cardiac muscle of rats induced by streptozotocin increased the expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 as well as LC3 and Gabarapl1, 2 autophagy-related genes. These effects were associated with decreased phosphorylation levels of Akt and its downstream target Foxo3a; this phenomenon is a well-known effect that permits the maintenance of Foxo in the nucleus to activate protein degradation by proteasomal and autophagic processes. The administration of insulin increased Akt and Foxo3a phosphorylation and suppressed the diabetes-induced expression of Ub-ligases and autophagy-related genes. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, nutritional stress induced by serum/glucose deprivation strongly increased the expression of Ub-ligases and autophagy-related genes; this effect was inhibited by insulin. Furthermore, the addition of insulin in vitro prevented the decrease in Akt/Foxo signaling induced by nutritional stress. These findings demonstrate that insulin suppresses atrophy- and autophagy-related genes in heart tissue and cardiomyocytes, most likely through the phosphorylation of Akt and the inactivation of Foxo3a.", "journal": "Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme", "date": "2013-06-13", "authors": ["SPaula-Gomes", "D A PGon\u00e7alves", "A MBaviera", "N MZanon", "L C CNavegantes", "I CKettelhut"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0033-1347209"}

The present review summarizes recent advances in cardiac cell therapy based on these two cell sources and discusses the advantages and limitations of each candidate. We conclude that, although both types of stem cells can be considered for autologous transplantation with promising outcomes in animal models, CS/PCs have advanced more in their clinical application because iPSCs and their derivatives possess inherent obstacles for clinical use.

{"title": "Adult stem cells and biocompatible scaffolds as smart drug delivery tools for cardiac tissue repair.", "abstract": "The contribution of adult stem cells to cardiac repair is mostly ascribed to an indirect paracrine effect, rather than to their actual engraftment and differentiation into new contractile and vascular cells. This effect consists in a direct reduction of host cell death, promotion of neovascularization, and in a \"bystander effect\" on local inflammation. A number of cytokines secreted by adult stem/progenitor cells has been proposed to be responsible for the consistent beneficial effect reported in the early attempts to deliver different stem cell subsets to the injured myocardium. Aiming to maximize their beneficial activity on the diseased myocardium, the genetic modification of adult stem cells to enhance and/or control the secretion of specific cytokines would turn them into active drug delivery vectors. On the other hand, engineering biocompatible scaffolds as to release paracrine factors could result in multiple advantages: (1) achieve a local controlled release of the drug of interest, thus minimizing off-target effects, (2) enhance stem cell retention in the injured area and (3) boost the beneficial paracrine effects exerted by adult stem cells on the host tissue. In the present review, a critical overview of the state-of-the-art in the modification of stem cells and the functionalization of biocompatible scaffolds to deliver beneficial soluble factors to the injured myocardium is offered.

We have reported recently that overexpression of HSPA12B increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in mouse cardiac tissues during endotoxemia. Endothelial NOS has been shown to protect heart from ischaemic injury. We hypothesized that overexpression of HSPA12B will attenuate cardiac dysfunction and remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI) through an eNOS-dependant mechanism.\nMI was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing hspa12b gene and its wild-type (WT) littermates. Echocardiographic analysis revealed that Tg mice exhibited improvements in cardiac dysfunction and remodelling at 1 and 4 weeks after MI. These improvements were accompanied by a significant decrease in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increase in capillary and arteriolar densities. Significant up-regulation of eNOS, VEGF, Ang-1, and Bcl-2 was also observed in Tg hearts compared with WT hearts after MI. However, pharmacological inhibition of eNOS abolished the HSPA12B-induced decrease in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increase in capillary formation after MI. Most importantly, inhibition of eNOS abrogated the protection of HSPA12B against cardiac dysfunction and remodelling after MI.\nThese data demonstrate for the first time that the overexpression of HSPA12B attenuates cardiac dysfunction and remodelling after MI. This action of HSPA12B was mediated, at least in part, by prevention of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promotion of myocardial angiogenesis via an eNOS-dependent mechanism.

{"title": "Cardioprotection in the aging, diabetic heart: the loss of protective Akt signalling.", "abstract": "Old age and diabetes are risk factors that often coexist increasing the vulnerability of the heart to the lethal effects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, to our knowledge, no investigations have examined IRI and cardioprotective signalling in animal models bearing these co-morbidities concomitantly. The ability of the heart to recover following IRI is greatly dependent on its innate cardioprotective potential, in which a central role is played by Akt. We aimed to investigate in an aging diabetic rat model, the susceptibility of the heart to IRI, the achievability of ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) against this lethal event, and the changes in Akt signalling, as the main prosurvival intracellular pathway.\nOur data showed that the isolated hearts of aged, diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats were more susceptible to sub-lethal injury and not amenable to cardioprotection via IPC, compared with younger diabetic rat hearts. Western blot analysis of the heart tissue suggested a chronic up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation, and reduced expression of the mitochondrial regulator PGC-1\u03b1 and of the anti-oxidant enzyme catalase, potentially due to the Akt up-regulation. Moreover, no further activation of Akt could be achieved following IPC.\nAn increased susceptibility to IRI in the aged, diabetic heart could be a consequence of impaired Akt signalling due to chronic Akt phosphorylation. Additional Akt phosphorylation required for IPC protection may therefore not be possible in the aged, diabetic rat heart and may explain why this cardioprotective manoeuvre cannot be achieved in these hearts.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2013-06-01", "authors": ["Hannah JWhittington", "IdrisHarding", "Clemency I MStephenson", "RobertBell", "Derek JHausenloy", "Mihaela MMocanu", "Derek MYellon"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvt140\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.02.080\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.08.623\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.009\n10.1152/ajpheart.00374.2004\n10.2337/diabetes.54.8.2360\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00796.x\n10.1136/hrt.2003.032797\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01499.x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.10.025\n10.1002/path.4113\n10.1097/00005344-199611000-00008\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.09.024\n10.1093/cvr/cvr302\n10.1074/jbc.M807397200\n10.1007/s00125-002-0882-x\n10.2337/diabetes.50.10.2363\n10.1152/ajpheart.00394.2008\n10.1007/s10557-009-6184-5\n10.1023/A:1024751109196\n10.1253/circj.67.955\n10.1023/A:1010482017540\n10.1007/s00125-004-1514-4\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0751\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00018-7\n10.2337/dc09-S301\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.01.017\n10.1152/ajpregu.00374.2006\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.158469\n10.1038/nature05861\n10.3945/ajcn.110.001917\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.01.026\n10.1016/j.tcm.2005.05.001\n10.1007/s00246-011-9889-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136997.53612.6C\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00533-9\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00078-X\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223545\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00234-4\n10.1007/s00395-011-0222-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvp033\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705097"}

Cardiotoxicity was induced by six equal doses of doxorubicin (2.5mgkg(-1) i.p., each) given at 48h intervals over two weeks to achieve a total dose of 15mgkg(-1). Cannabidiol treatment (5mgkg(-1)/day, i.p.) was started on the same day of doxorubicin administration and continued for four weeks. Cannabidiol significantly reduced the elevations of serum creatine kinase-MB and troponin T, and cardiac malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, nitric oxide and calcium ion levels, and attenuated the decreases in cardiac reduced glutathione, selenium and zinc ions. Histopathological examination showed that cannabidiol ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cannabidiol significantly reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-\u03baB, Fas ligand and caspase-3, and increased the expression of survivin in cardiac tissue of doxorubicin-treated rats.

In the myocardium, cardiac fibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for the synthesis, deposition, and degradation of matrix proteins, and they therefore play a critical role in the development and maintenance of functional heart tissue. This review will summarize the extensive research conducted in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating the influence of both physical and chemical stimuli on cardiac fibroblasts and how these interactions impact both the extracellular matrix and, by extension, cardiomyocytes. This work is of considerable significance, given that cardiovascular diseases are marked by extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which ultimately impairs the functional capacity of the heart. We seek to summarize the unique role of cardiac fibroblasts in normal cardiac development and the most prevalent cardiac pathologies, including congenital heart defects, hypertension, hypertrophy, and the remodeled heart following myocardial infarction.

Recently, some evidence indicated that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expressed in the cardiac tissue. However, the functional role of CaSR in diabetic cardiac injury remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between CaSR activation and diabetes-induced cardiac injury. Diabetic model was successfully established by administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in vivo, and cardiomyocyte injury was simulated by 25.5 mM glucose in vitro. Apoptotic rate, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca\u00b2\u207a](i)) and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH\u2082-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 were examined. We demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as well as decrease in maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise and fall (\u00b1dp/dtmax), and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was also observed by TUNEL staining. In vitro, 25.5 mM glucose-induced apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Further results showed that 25.5 mM glucose significantly increased [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i), up-regulated the expression of Bax, P-ERK and P-JNK, and suppressed Bcl-2 expression. However, the above deleterious changes were further confirmed when co-treatment with CaSR agonist GdCl\u2083 (300 \u00b5M). But the effects of GdCl\u2083 were attenuated by 10 \u00b5M NPS-2390, a specific CaSR inhibitor. When CaSR was silence by siRNA transfection, the effects of high glucose were inhibited.

{"title": "TNF, acting through inducibly expressed TNFR2, drives activation and cell cycle entry of c-Kit+ cardiac stem cells in ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "TNF, signaling through TNFR2, has been implicated in tissue repair, a process that in the heart may be mediated by activated resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs). The objective of our study is to determine whether ligation of TNFR2 can induce activation of resident CSCs in the setting of ischemic cardiac injury. We show that in human cardiac tissue affected by ischemia heart disease (IHD), TNFR2 is expressed on intrinsic CSCs, identified as c-kit(+)/CD45(-)/VEGFR2(-) interstitial round cells, which are activated as determined by entry to cell cycle and expression of Lin-28. Wild-type mouse heart organ cultures subjected to hypoxic conditions both increase cardiac TNF expression and show induced TNFR2 and Lin-28 expression in c-kit(+) CSCs that have entered cell cycle. These CSC responses are enhanced by exogenous TNF. TNFR2(-/-) mouse heart organ cultures subjected to hypoxia increase cardiac TNF but fail to induce CSC activation. Similarly, c-kit(+) CSCs isolated from mouse hearts exposed to hypoxia or TNF show induction of Lin-28, TNFR2, cell cycle entry, and cardiogenic marker, \u03b1-sarcomeric actin (\u03b1-SA), responses more pronounced by hypoxia in combination with TNF. Knockdown of Lin-28 by siRNA results in reduced levels of TNFR2 expression, cell cycle entry, and diminished expression of \u03b1-SA. We conclude that hypoxia-induced c-kit(+) CSC activation is mediated by TNF/TNFR2/Lin-28 signaling. These observations suggest that TNFR2 signaling in resident c-kit(+) CSCs induces cardiac repair, findings which provide further understanding of the unanticipated harmful effects of TNF blockade in human IHD.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2013-05-29", "authors": ["Rafia SAl-Lamki", "WanhuaLu", "JunWang", "JunYang", "Timothy JSargeant", "RichardWells", "ChenquSuo", "PennyWright", "MartinGoddard", "QunhuaHuang", "Amir HLebastchi", "GeorgeTellides", "YingqunHuang", "WangMin", "Jordan SPober", "John RBradley"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.1433"}

{"title": "Bladder contractility is modulated by Kv7 channels in pig detrusor.", "abstract": "Kv7 channels are involved in smooth muscle relaxation, and accordingly we believe that they constitute potential targets for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. We have therefore used myography to examine the function of Kv7 channels in detrusor, i.e. pig bladder, with a view to determining the effects of the following potassium channel activators: ML213 (Kv7.2/Kv7.4 channels) and retigabine (Kv7.2-7.5 channels). Retigabine produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of carbachol- and electric field-induced contractions. The potency was similar in magnitude to that of ML213-induced relaxation, suggesting that Kv7.2 and/or Kv7.4 channels constitute the subtypes that are relevant to bladder contractility. The effects of retigabine and ML213 were attenuated by pre-incubation with 10\u00b5M XE991 (Kv7.1-7.5 channel blocker) (P<0.05), which in turn confirmed Kv7 channel selectivity. Subtype-selective effects were further investigated by incubating the detrusor with 10\u00b5M chromanol 293B (Kv7.1 channel blocker). Regardless of the experimental protocol, this did not cause a further increase in the evoked contraction. In contrast, the addition of XE991 potentiated the KCl-induced contractions, but not those induced by carbachol or electric field, indicating the presence of a phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-biphosphate-dependent mechanism amongst the Kv7 channels in detrusor. qRT-PCR studies of the mRNA transcript level of Kv7.3-7.5 channels displayed a higher level of Kv7.4 transcript in detrusor compared to that present in brain cortex and heart tissues. Thus, we have shown that Kv7.4 channels are expressed and functionally active in pig detrusor, and that the use of selective Kv7.4 channel modulators in the treatment of detrusor overactivity seems promising.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2013-05-28", "authors": ["JulieSval\u00f8", "MichalaBille", "NeerajaParameswaran Theepakaran", "MajidSheykhzade", "J\u00f8rgenNordling", "PierreBouchelouche"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.05.005"}

Sequence analysis confirmed a high level of sequence identity within SAV3 strains, with a mean nucleotide diversity of 0.11\u200a%. Sequence divergence was highest in 6K and E2, while lowest in the capsid protein and the non-structural proteins (nsP4 and nsP2). This study reports for the first time that numerous defective viruses containing genome deletions are generated during natural infection with SAV. Deletions occurred in all virus strains and were not distributed randomly throughout the genome but instead tended to aggregate in certain areas. We suggest imprecise homologous recombination as an explanation for generation of defective viruses with genome deletions. The presence of such viruses, provides a possible explanation for the difficulties in isolating SAV in cell culture. Primary virus isolation was successfully achieved for only two of eight strains, despite extensive attempts using three different cell lines. Both SAV isolates were easily propagated further and concomitant viral deletion mutants present in clinically infected heart tissue were maintained following serial passage in CHH-1 cells.", "journal": "The Journal of general virology", "date": "2013-05-25", "authors": ["ElinPetterson", "MaritStormoen", "\u00d8ysteinEvensen", "Aase BMikalsen", "\u00d8yvindHaugland"], "doi": "10.1099/vir.0.052563-0"}

Danshen injection significantly lowered cardiac iron deposition and the concentration of the lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde, as well as improved cardiac superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels in iron-overloaded mice. Serum levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, and lactate dehydrogenase in the iron-overloaded mice were significantly elevated (up to ~ 160 %), whereas their activities were downregulated by Danshen injection by 25 ~ 35 % at the high dose and by ~ 20 % at the low dose. Morphological changes of cardiac tissue analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that lesions induced by iron overload could be ameliorated by Danshen injection dose-dependently.

{"title": "The timing statistics of spontaneous calcium release in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "A variety of cardiac arrhythmias are initiated by a focal excitation that disrupts the regular beating of the heart. In some cases it is known that these excitations are due to calcium (Ca) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via propagating subcellular Ca waves. However, it is not understood what are the physiological factors that determine the timing of these excitations at both the subcellular and tissue level. In this paper we apply analytic and numerical approaches to determine the timing statistics of spontaneous Ca release (SCR) in a simplified model of a cardiac myocyte. In particular, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) to SCR, in the case where SCR is initiated by spontaneous Ca sparks, and demonstrate that this quantity exhibits either an algebraic or exponential dependence on system parameters. Based on this analysis we identify the necessary requirements so that SCR occurs on a time scale comparable to the cardiac cycle. Finally, we study how SCR is synchronized across many cells in cardiac tissue, and identify a quantitative measure that determines the relative timing of SCR in an ensemble of cells. Using this approach we identify the physiological conditions so that cell-to-cell variations in the timing of SCR is small compared to the typical duration of an SCR event. We argue further that under these conditions inward currents due to SCR can summate and generate arrhythmogenic triggered excitations in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-05-22", "authors": ["MesfinAsfaw", "EnricAlvarez-Lacalle", "YohannesShiferaw"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0062967"}
{"title": "Analysis of selected sugars and sugar phosphates in mouse heart tissue by reductive amination and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Sensitive and reliable analysis of sugars and sugar phosphates in tissues and cells is essential for many biological and cell engineering studies. However, the successful analysis of these endogenous compounds in biological samples by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) is often difficult because of their poor chromatographic retention properties in reversed-phase LC, the complex biological matrices, and the ionization suppression in ESI. This situation is further complicated by the existence of their multiple structural isomers in vivo. This work describes the combination of reductive amination using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, with a new LC approach using a pentafluorophenyl core-shell ultrahigh performance (UP) LC column and methylphosphonic acid as an efficient tail-sweeping reagent for improved chromatographic separation. This new method was used for selected detection and accurate quantitation of the major free and phosphorylated reducing sugars in mouse heart tissue. Among the detected compounds, accurate quantitation of glyceraldehyde, ribose, glucose, glycerylaldehyde-3-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and mannose-6-phosphate was achieved by UPLC/multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)-MS, with analytical accuracies ranging from 87.4% to 109.4% and CVs of \u22648.5% (n = 6). To demonstrate isotope-resolved metabolic profiling, we used UPLC/quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)-MS to analyze the isotope distribution patterns of C3 to C6 free and phosphorylated reducing sugars in heart tissues from (13)C-labeled wild type and knockout mice.

Important pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the cardiac lesions include activation of the endothelium and induced microvascular alterations. These processes involve the production of endothelial adhesion molecules and thromboxane A2, which are involved in inflammatory cell recruitment and platelet aggregation, respectively. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin decrease thromboxane production and alter the course of Chagas' disease, both in the acute and chronic phases. We studied the effects of the administration of low and high doses of aspirin during the early phase of T. cruzi infection, following microvascular damage in the context of a chronic murine model of Chagas' disease. The effects of both schedules were assessed at 24 and 90 days postinfection by evaluating parasitemia, mortality, and cardiac histopathological changes as well as the expression of ICAM, VCAM, and E-selectin in cardiac tissue. Thromboxane A2, soluble ICAM, and E-selectin blood levels were also measured. While aspirin did not affect parasitemia or mortality in the infected mice, it decreased both cardiac inflammatory infiltrates and thromboxane levels. Additionally, at 90 days postinfection, aspirin normalized sICAM and sE-selectin levels.

A method of pacing with feedback control is proposed to reduce the alternans and therefore the probability of subsequent cardiac failure. The reduction is achieved by feedback control using small perturbations of constant magnitude to the original, alternans-generating pacing period T, viz., using sequences of two alternating periods of T+\u0394T and T-\u0394T, with \u0394T<<T. Such a control scheme for alternans suppression is demonstrated experimentally in isolated whole heart experiments. This alternans suppression scheme is further confirmed and investigated in detail by simulations of ion-channel-based cardiac models both for a single cell and in one-dimensional spatially extended systems. The mechanism of the success of our method can be understood in terms of dynamics in phase space, viz., as the state of activity of the cell being confined within a narrow volume of phase space for the duration of control, resulting in extremely diminished variation in successive action potential durations. Our method is much more robust to noise than previous alternans reduction techniques based on fixed point stabilization and should thus be more efficient in terms of experimental implementation, which has implications for clinical treatment for arrhythmia.", "journal": "Physical review.

The interferon inducible transcriptional activator signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and p53 are two critical transcriptional factors that have pivotal roles in cardiac biology and pathology. Here we describe a novel interplay between these two key players that critically regulate the levels of the pleiotropic interleukin 6 (IL6) in the heart. We provide in vivo evidence to demonstrate that, in cardiac tissues, STAT1 is a positive regulator of IL6 expression and it competes with the suppressive effect of p53 to sustain basal IL6 levels. Induction of IL6 expression in response to interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), a well-characterized activator of STAT1, parallels that of STAT1 phosphorylation and induction of STAT1 target genes, such as the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator (C2ta), and \u03b22-microglobulin (B2m). Furthermore, hearts from STAT1 knockout mice fail to induce IL6 expression in response to IFN\u03b3. More importantly, we showed that this regulatory system is not functional in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that activation of IL6 expression by STAT1 may be tissue specific.

{"title": "Na/K pump regulation of cardiac repolarization: insights from a systems biology approach.", "abstract": "The sodium-potassium pump is widely recognized as the principal mechanism for active ion transport across the cellular membrane of cardiac tissue, being responsible for the creation and maintenance of the transarcolemmal sodium and potassium gradients, crucial for cardiac cell electrophysiology. Importantly, sodium-potassium pump activity is impaired in a number of major diseased conditions, including ischemia and heart failure. However, its subtle ways of action on cardiac electrophysiology, both directly through its electrogenic nature and indirectly via the regulation of cell homeostasis, make it hard to predict the electrophysiological consequences of reduced sodium-potassium pump activity in cardiac repolarization. In this review, we discuss how recent studies adopting the systems biology approach, through the integration of experimental and modeling methodologies, have identified the sodium-potassium pump as one of the most important ionic mechanisms in regulating key properties of cardiac repolarization and its rate dependence, from subcellular to whole organ levels. These include the role of the pump in the biphasic modulation of cellular repolarization and refractoriness, the rate control of intracellular sodium and calcium dynamics and therefore of the adaptation of repolarization to changes in heart rate, as well as its importance in regulating pro-arrhythmic substrates through modulation of dispersion of repolarization and restitution.

Therefore, hearts were isolated and subjected either to 30 min coronary occlusion followed by 120 min reperfusion to measure infarct size or to 10 min aerobic perfusion to measure cardiac mevalonate pathway end-products (protein prenylation, cholesterol, coenzyme Q9, coenzyme Q10, dolichol), and 3-nitrotyrosine (oxidative/nitrosative stress marker), respectively.

The objective of the current study was to investigate skeletal muscle gene expression patterns and underlying biological mechanisms related to training of different intensities and detraining. Untrained 20 month-old Standardbred geldings were exercised at varying intensities (endurance and sprint) followed by detraining (n=5 per phase). The results indicated that training mainly affected skeletal muscle-specific protein metabolism and increased CO2 export from the tissues. Intensive training increased energy metabolism and affected heart and adipose tissues, while having an adverse effect on stress, apoptosis and immune capacity. The intensity of the training could be related to decreased expression of extra cellular matrix proteins (ECM), cell-cell contacts and intracellular signalling pathways. During detraining, most mechanisms were reversed, but heart tissue-related changes and increased expression of skeletal muscle-specific proteins were still evident. The study suggested that changes to ECM expression and cell-cell contact mechanisms may be long-lasting and related to multifactorial aspects of training and detraining. These biomarkers may be useful to identify horses in the early stages of chronic overloading or early overtraining.", "journal": "Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)", "date": "2013-05-16", "authors": ["Marinus F Wte Pas", "Inge DWijnberg", "Arend J WHoekman", "Ellende Graaf-Roelfsema", "Hans AKeizer", "Ericvan Breda", "BartDucro", "Johannes Hvan der Kolk"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.03.052"}
{"title": "Regulation of de novo ceramide synthesis: the role of dihydroceramide desaturase and transcriptional factors NFATC and Hand2 in the hypoxic mouse heart.", "abstract": "We have previously shown that ceramide, a proapoptotic molecule decreases in the mouse heart as it adapts to hypoxia. We have also shown that its precursor, dihydroceramide, accumulates with hypoxia. This implicates the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase (DHC-DS), which converts dihydroceramide to ceramide, in a potential regulatory checkpoint in cardiomyocytes. We hypothesised that the regulation of de novo ceramide synthesis plays an important role in the cardiomyocyte adaptation to hypoxia. We used an established mouse model to induce acute and chronic hypoxia. Cardiac tissues were extracted and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression levels of DHC-DS. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the activity and expression levels of an array of transcription factors that might regulate DEGS1 gene expression. We demonstrated that DEGS1 mRNA levels decrease with time in hypoxic mice concurrent with the decrease in HAND2 transcripts. Interestingly, the DEGS1 promoter harbors overlapping sites for Hand2 and Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFATC) transcription factors. We have demonstrated a physical interaction between NFATC1 and the E-Box proteins with EMSA and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The regulation of de novo ceramide synthesis in response to hypoxia and this newly described interaction between E-box and NFATC transcription factors will pave the way to identify new pathways in the adaptation of the cardiomyocyte to stress. The elucidation of these pathways will in the long-term provide insights into potential targets for novel therapeutic regimens.", "journal": "DNA and cell biology", "date": "2013-05-16", "authors": ["RaedAzzam", "FadiHariri", "Nehm\u00e9El-Hachem", "AminaKamar", "GhassanDbaibo", "GeorgesNemer", "FadiBitar"], "doi": "10.1089/dna.2013.1993"}

We aimed to identify the cell populations that can generate cardiomyocytes and to clarify whether generation of donor-marker(+) cardiomyocytes requires cell fusion between BM-derived cells and recipient cardiomyocytes.\nPurified BM stem/progenitor cells from green fluorescence protein (GFP) mice were transplanted into C57BL/6 mice or cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-transgenic mice. Purified human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from cord blood were transplanted into immune-compromised NOD/SCID/IL2r\u03b3(null) mice. GFP(+) cells in the cardiac tissue were analyzed for the antigenecity of a cardiomyocyte by confocal microscopy following immunofluorescence staining. GFP(+) donor-derived cells, GFP(+)CFP(+) fused cells, and CFP(+) recipient-derived cells were distinguished by linear unmixing analysis. Hearts of xenogeneic recipients were evaluated for the expression of human cardiomyocyte genes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In C57BL/6 recipients, Lin(-/low)CD45(+) hematopoietic cells generated greater number of GFP(+) cardiomyocytes than Lin(-/low)CD45(-) mesenchymal cells (37.0+/-23.9 vs 0.00+/-0.00 GFP(+) cardiomyocytes per a recipient, P\u200a=\u200a0.0095). The number of transplanted purified HSCs (Lin(-/low)Sca-1(+) or Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) or CD34(-)Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)) showed correlation to the number of GFP(+) cardiomyocytes (P<0.05 in each cell fraction), and the incidence of GFP(+) cardiomyocytes per injected cell dose was greatest in CD34(-)Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) recipients.

Compared to the high risk of particulate matter (\u22642.5\u03bcm) in air to heart disease patients, related research of TiO2 on diseased body is still unknown, which suggest us to explore the potential effects of nanoscale and microscale TiO2 to heart under OS conditions. Here, we used alloxan to induce OS conditions in rat, and investigated the response of heart tissue to TiO2 in healthy and alloxan treated rats. Compared with NMs treatment only, the synergistic interaction between OS conditions and nano-TiO2 significantly reduced the heart-related function indexes, inducing pathological changes of myocardium with significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase-MB. In contrast with the void response of micro-TiO2 to heart functions in alloxan treated rats, aggravation of OS conditions might play an important role in cardiac injury after alloxan and nano-TiO2 dual exposure.

{"title": "PAC\u2081 receptors mediate positive chronotropic responses to PACAP-27 and VIP in isolated mouse atria.", "abstract": "PACAP and VIP have prominent effects on cardiac function in several species, but little is known about their influence on the murine heart. Accordingly, we evaluated the expression of PACAP/VIP receptors in mouse heart and the response of isolated atria to peptide agonists. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that PAC\u2081, VPAC\u2081, and VPAC\u2082 receptor mRNAs are present throughout the mouse heart. Expression of all three receptor transcripts was low, PAC\u2081 being the lowest. No regional differences in expression were detected for individual receptor mRNAs after normalization to L32. Pharmacological effects of PACAP-27, VIP, and the selective PAC\u2081 agonist maxadilan were evaluated in isolated, spontaneously beating atria from C57BL/6 mice of either sex. Incremental additions of PACAP-27 at 1 min intervals caused a concentration-dependent tachycardia with a logEC\u2085\u2080=-9.08 \u00b1 0.15 M (n=7) and a maximum of 96.3 \u00b1 5.9% above baseline heart rate. VIP and maxadilan also caused tachycardia but their potencies were about two orders of magnitude less. Increasing the dosing interval to 5 min caused a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve to maxadilan but no changes in the curves for PACAP-27 or VIP. Under this condition, neither the potency nor the efficacy of maxadilan differed from those of PACAP-27. Neither PACAP-27 nor maxadilan caused tachyphylaxis, and maximal responses to maxadilan were maintained for at least 2 h.

{"title": "Exogenous hydrogen sulfide prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis from cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a crucial factor inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis due to cardiac hypertrophy. Additional evidence has revealed that H2S plays an antioxidant role and is cytoprotective. Hence, we aimed to elucidate whether H2S prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis due to cardiac hypertrophy via its antioxidant function. The cardiac hypertrophy model was obtained by injecting a high dose of isoproterenol (ISO) subcutaneously, and the hemodynamic parameters were measured in groups that received either ISO or ISO with the treatment of NaHS. TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) and EM (electron microscopy) experiments were performed to determine the occurrence of apoptosis in heart tissues. The expression of caspase-3 protein in the cytoplasm and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and cytochrome c (cyt c) proteins in the mitochondria were analyzed using Western blotting. In contrast, to determine whether ISO-induced apoptosis in the cultured cardiomyocytes may be related to oxidative stress, JC-1 and MitoSOX assays were performed to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the mitochondria. Exogenous H2S was found to ameliorate cardiac function. The histological observations obtained from TUNEL and EM demonstrated that treatment with NaHS inhibited the occurrence of cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure. Moreover, H2S reduced the expression of the cleaved caspase-3, NOX4 and the leakage of cyt c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. We also observed that exogenous H2S could maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduce ROS production in the mitochondria. Therefore, H2S reduces oxidative stress due to cardiac hypertrophy through the cardiac mitochondrial pathway.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2013-05-11", "authors": ["FanghaoLu", "JunXing", "XinyingZhang", "ShiyunDong", "YajunZhao", "LinaWang", "HulunLi", "FanYang", "ChangqingXu", "WeihuaZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-013-1686-7"}

Diabetes was induced in 22 Sprague\u2011Dawley rats by an intraperitoneal single injection of STZ (70 mg/kg). Non-diabetic animals served as the controls (n=6). LV function was documented using the conductance catheter technique 2 and 6 weeks after the induction of diabetes. Cardiac tissue was analyzed for cardiac immune cell infiltration, oxidative stress and remodeling in rats with STZ-induced diabetes at 2 different time points by immunohistochemistry. Cardiac function was significantly impaired in the diabetic animals. After 2 weeks, the induction of diabetes resulted in impaired cardiac function indexed by a decrease in systolic and diastolic LV function. This impairment of LV performance continued for up to 6 weeks after the STZ injection. This was associated with an increase in cardiac CD3+ and CD8a+ immune cell invasion and fibrosis, indexed by an increase in collagen content (p<0.05). Furthermore, oxidative stress response and matrix remodeling were increased after 2 weeks and this continued for up to 6 weeks after the induction of diabetes. In conclusion, cardiac dysfunction is associated with cardiac inflammation and adverse remodeling in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy.

The cardiac patch consists of a scaffold seeded with stem cells. To identify the best scaffold for cardiac patch construction we compared polyurethane, Collagen Cell Carriers, ePTFE, and ePTFE SSP1-RGD regarding their receptiveness to seeding with mesenchymal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord tissue. Seeding was tested at an array of cell seeding densities. The bioartificial patches were cultured for up to 35 days and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, microscopy of histological stains, fluorescence microscopy, and mitochondrial assays. Polyurethane was the only biomaterial which resulted in an organized multilayer (seeding density: 0.750 \u00d7 10(6) cells/cm(2)). Cultured over 35 days at this seeding density the mitochondrial activity of the cells on polyurethane patches continually increased. There was no decrease in the E Modulus of polyurethane once seeded with cells. Seeding of CCC could only be realized at a low seeding density and both ePTFE and ePTFE SSP1-RGD were found to be unreceptive to seeding.

{"title": "Structural basis for the mutation-induced dysfunction of human CYP2J2: a computational study.", "abstract": "Arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid in cells, acting as a key inflammatory intermediate in inflammatory reactions. In cardiac tissues, CYP2J2 can adopt arachidonic acid as a major substrate to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which can protect endothelial cells from ischemic or hypoxic injuries and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and hypertension. However, some CYP2J2 polymorphisms, i.e., T143A and N404Y, significantly reduce the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Lacking experimental structural data for CYP2J2, the detailed mechanism for the mutation-induced dysfunction in the metabolism of arachidonic acid is still unknown. In the current study, three-dimensional structural models of the wild-type CYP2J2 and two mutants (T143A and N404Y) were constructed by a coordinate reconstruction approach and ab initio modeling using CYP2R1 as a template. The structural analysis of the computational models showed that the wild-type CYP2J2 exhibited a typical CYP fold with 12 alpha-helices and three beta-sheets on one side and with the heme group buried deeply inside the core. Due to the small and hydrophobic side-chain, T143A mutation could destabilize the C helix, further placing the water access channel in a closed state to prevent the escape of the produced water molecules during the catalytic processes. N404Y mutation could reposition the side-chain of Leu(378), making it no longer form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of arachidonic acid. However, this hydrogen bond was essential for substrate recognition and positioning in a correct orientation.", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "date": "2013-05-08", "authors": ["ShanCong", "Xiao-TuMa", "Yi-XueLi", "Jing-FangWang"], "doi": "10.1021/ci400003p"}

{"title": "Tissue-specific effects of acetylcholine in the canine heart.", "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) release from the vagus nerve slows heart rate and atrioventricular conduction. ACh stimulates a variety of receptors and channels, including an inward rectifying current [ACh-dependent K\u207a current (IK,ACh)]. The effect of ACh in the ventricle is still debated. We compared the effect of ACh on action potentials in canine atria, Purkinje, and ventricular tissue as well as on ionic currents in isolated cells. Action potentials were recorded from ventricular slices, Purkinje fibers, and arterially perfused atrial preparations. Whole cell currents were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions, and unloaded cell shortening was determined on isolated cells. The effect of ACh (1-10 \u03bcM) as well as ACh plus tertiapin, an IK,ACh-specific toxin, was tested. In atrial tissue, ACh hyperpolarized the membrane potential and shortened the action potential duration (APD). In Purkinje and ventricular tissues, no significant effect of ACh was observed. Addition of ACh to atrial cells activated a large inward rectifying current (from -3.5 \u00b1 0.7 to -23.7 \u00b1 4.7 pA/pF) that was abolished by tertiapin. This current was not observed in other cell types. A small inhibition of Ca\u00b2\u207a current (ICa) was observed in the atria, endocardium, and epicardium after ACh. ICa inhibition increased at faster pacing rates. At a basic cycle length of 400 ms, ACh (1 \u03bcM) reduced ICa to 68% of control. In conclusion, IK,ACh is highly expressed in atria and is negligible/absent in Purkinje, endocardial, and epicardial cells.

Several high-yield protocols exist for hESC-CM production; however, methods to significantly advance hESC-CM maturation are still lacking. Building on our previous experience with mouse ESC-CMs, we investigated the effects of 3-dimensional (3D) tissue-engineered culture environment and cardiomyocyte purity on structural and functional maturation of hESC-CMs. 2D monolayer and 3D fibrin-based cardiac patch cultures were generated using dissociated cells from differentiated Hes2 embryoid bodies containing varying percentage (48-90%) of CD172a (SIRPA)-positive cardiomyocytes. hESC-CMs within the patch were aligned uniformly by locally controlling the direction of passive tension. Compared to hESC-CMs in age (2 weeks) and purity (48-65%) matched 2D monolayers, hESC-CMs in 3D patches exhibited significantly higher conduction velocities (CVs), longer sarcomeres (2.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 vs. 1.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcm), and enhanced expression of genes involved in cardiac contractile function, including cTnT, \u03b1MHC, CASQ2 and SERCA2. The CVs in cardiac patches increased with cardiomyocyte purity, reaching 25.1\u00a0cm/s in patches constructed with 90% hESC-CMs. Maximum contractile force amplitudes and active stresses of cardiac patches averaged to 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0mN and 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0mN/mm(2), respectively.

This study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effect of VU in cholesterol fed rabbits. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups of 6 animals each and the experimental period was 3 months. Group I-ND [normal diet 40 g feed], Group II-ND + FVU [flavanoid fraction of Vigna unguiculata (150 mg kg (-1) per body weight)], Group III-ND + CH [cholesterol (400 mg)] and Group IV-ND + CH (400 mg) +FVU (150 mg kg(-1) per body weight). After the experimental period, animals were sacrificed and the various parameters, such as cardiac markers, toxicity parameters, genotoxicity and gene expression, were investigated. Cholesterol feeding causes a significant increase in the levels of cardiac marker enzymes, namely lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phospokinase (CPK), atherogenic index, toxicity parameters like serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) were elevated. Antioxidant enzyme levels were decreased, lipid peroxidation products in heart tissue and inflammatory markers, namely cyclooxygenase (COX2) and lipooxygenase (LOX15) in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), were significantly increased. A genotoxicity study using a Comet assay and gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) from heart tissue showed an altered expression in the disease group.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are being used in patients with HF, leading to partial reverse remodeling. In the present study, proteomics identified significant changes in \u03b1-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) levels during LVAD support. Moreover, the potential role of ACT in reverse remodeling was studied in detail.\nExpression of ACT mRNA (quantitative-polymerase chain reaction) decreased significantly in post-LVAD myocardial tissue compared with pre-LVAD tissue (n=15; P<0.01). Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACT expression and localization changed during LVAD support. Circulating ACT levels were elevated in HF patients (n=18) as compared with healthy controls (n=6; P=0.001) and normalized by 6 months of LVAD support. Because increasing evidence implicates that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in myocardial disease processes, we also investigated whether ACT is post-transcriptionally regulated by miRs. Bioinformatics analysis pointed miR-137 as a potential regulator of ACT. The miR-137 expression is inversely correlated with ACT mRNA in myocardial tissue. Luciferase activity assays confirmed ACT as a direct target for miR-137, and in situ hybridization indicated that ACT and miR-137 were mainly localized in cardiomyocytes and stromal cells.\nHigh ACT plasma levels in HF normalized during LVAD support, which coincides with decreased ACT mRNA in heart tissue, whereas miR-137 levels increased. MiR-137 directly targeted ACT, thereby indicating that ACT and miR-137 play a role in the pathophysiology of HF and reverse remodeling during mechanical support.", "journal": "Circulation.

In a single cell, reconstruction of state variables' shape, the action potential morphology, and the time of stimulation was successful for up to 1300\u2009ms poststimulation and for data with signal-to-noise ratio levels higher than 40\u2009dB. For linear strands, the action potential morphology was reconstructed for 500\u2009ms poststimulation, and the reconstructed conduction velocity remained unaffected for signal-to-noise ratio levels higher than 50\u2009dB. Moreover, tissue restitution properties due to various pacing rates were successfully reconstructed by the backward-in-time algorithm.

{"title": "Effects of pacing site and stimulation history on alternans dynamics and the development of complex spatiotemporal patterns in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Alternans of action potential duration has been associated with T wave alternans and the development of arrhythmias because it produces large gradients of repolarization. However, little is known about alternans dynamics in large mammalian hearts. Using optical mapping to record electrical activations simultaneously from the epicardium and endocardium of 9 canine right ventricles, we demonstrate novel arrhythmogenic complex spatiotemporal dynamics. (i) Alternans predominantly develops first on the endocardium. (ii) The postulated simple progression from normal rhythm to concordant to discordant alternans is not always observed; concordant alternans can develop from discordant alternans as the pacing period is decreased. (iii) In contrast to smaller tissue preparations, multiple stationary nodal lines may exist and need not be perpendicular to the pacing site or to each other. (iv) Alternans has fully three-dimensional dynamics and the epicardium and endocardium can show significantly different dynamics: multiple nodal surfaces can be transmural or intramural and can form concave/convex surfaces resulting in islands of discordant alternans. (v) The complex spatiotemporal patterns observed during alternans are very sensitive to both the site of stimulation and the stimulation history. Alternans in canine ventricles not only exhibit larger amplitudes and persist for longer cycle length regimes compared to those found in smaller mammalian hearts, but also show novel dynamics not previously described that enhance dispersion and show high sensitivity to initial conditions.

Two hundred forty 15-day-old male chickens were randomly divided into 12 groups and kept at the temperature of 12\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00a0\u00b0C for acute and chronic cold stress. There were one control group and five treatment groups for acute cold stress, three control groups, and three treatment groups for chronic cold stress. After cold stress, malondialdehyde level increased in chicken heart; the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the heart first increased and then decreased. The inflammatory factors mRNA levels were increased in cold stress groups relative to control groups. The histopathological analysis showed that heart tissues were seriously injured in the cold stress group. Additionally, the mRNA levels of Hsps (70, 60, 40, and 27) increased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the cold stress groups relative to the corresponding control group. Meanwhile, the mRNA level and protein expression of Hsp90 decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the stress group, and showed a gradually decreasing tendency. These results suggested that the levels of inflammatory factors and Hsps expression levels in heart tissues can be influenced by cold stress.

CCN1 immunopositivity was detected in 80.6% of all specimens. Semiquantitative statistical analysis of the staining results revealed that CCN1 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with ischemic morphology and hypertrophy of myocardial fibers, interstitial edema, and atheromatosis of coronary arteries in more than 10% of the myocardial fibers.

We previously demonstrated that resveratrol improves insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle of swine with metabolic syndrome. Although resveratrol has metabolic benefits in peripheral tissues, its effect on insulin signaling in ischemic myocardium (IM) is unclear. Therefore, we developed a clinically relevant swine model of metabolic syndrome and chronic myocardial ischemia to investigate the effects of resveratrol on insulin signaling in cardiac tissue.\nThirteen male Yorkshire swine were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 4 wk then underwent surgical placement of an ameroid constrictor to their circumflex artery to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. The high-cholesterol control group was given no drug (n = 7). The experimental group was provided the same diet and received supplemental resveratrol (100 mg/kg/d) (n = 6). Tissue was harvested 7 wk after ameroid placement for western blot and histological analyses.\nIn IM, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the insulin signaling markers studied. In nonischemic myocardium, there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 (P = 0.021) in the group treated with resveratrol; otherwise, there were no significant differences between the groups. Immunostaining for glucose transporter 4 and Periodic acid-Schiff staining for myocardial glycogen stores was similar between the groups.\nResveratrol has complex effects on glucose metabolism.

Its use is limited by a major side effect of cardiotoxicity. It was reported that doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated through oxidative stress coupled with impaired NO bioavailability and NF-\u03baB activation. Nicorandil, a mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium (KATP ) channel opener, was reported to be cardioprotective on ischaemic myocardium. However, the effect of nicorandil against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity has not yet been clarified. Accordingly, six groups of rats were used. The first three groups were injected with vehicle, nicorandil (3 mg/kg) orally and doxorubicin (a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg), respectively. Group four was treated with nicorandil, whereas group five was treated with glibenclamide and then nicorandil starting 2 days before doxorubicin and continued for five consecutive days. Group six was treated with glibenclamide alone. At the end of the experiment, the rats were killed. Cardiac enzyme indexes were measured in serum. Heart tissues were processed for determination of nitrite/nitrate, NF-\u03baB protein expression, glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxide (TBARS) levels and superoxide production. In addition to body-weight reduction, doxorubicin produced cardiotoxicity as indicated from the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) activities, TBARS, superoxide production, NF-\u03baB expression and caspase-3 activity. Moreover, doxorubicin decreased GSH and nitrite/nitrate levels. Histopathological examination of doxorubicin-treated hearts revealed degenerative changes. On the other hand, nicorandil protected cardiac tissues against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity as demonstrated from normalization of cardiac biochemical and oxidative stress parameters and amelioration of histopathological changes. Glibenclamide, a blocker of the KATP channel, reversed most of the cardiac effects of nicorandil.", "journal": "Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology", "date": "2013-04-30", "authors": ["Ihab TAbdel-Raheem", "AshrafTaye", "Mekky MAbouzied"], "doi": "10.1111/bcpt.12078"}

BMSCs were also seeded onto three types of polymer material film, including polyurethane (PU), 3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate [P(3HB-co-4HB)], and polypropylene carbonate (PPC). The results revealed that cell numbers were more abundant on both the PU and P(3HB-co-4HB) material surfaces. Conversely, the surface of PPC was smooth with only cell lysate debris observed.

The mRNA levels of p53 and DNMT1 were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the methylation levels of p53 were analyzed by nested methylation-specific-PCR. Our data showed that the concentrations of serum Hcy and lipids were increased in Meth group compared with the N-control group, which indicated that the model was established successfully. The expression levels of p53 and Noxa were increased in Meth group, while the methylation status of p53 was hypomethylation.

The present study not only evaluated the cardioprotective effect and anti-inflammatory mechanism of the YQFM injection in an experimental model of CHF but also investigated its bioactive constituents in vitro.\nThe left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in rats was ligated to make an animal model of CHF. From this, electrocardiographic parameters and exterior signs of rat hearts were recorded. Additionally, the histopathology of heart tissues was examined, and parameters of inflammatory stress were measured. Experiments were performed over two months in LAD-ligation rats treated with YQFM or vehicle. Treatment with Captopril was used as a positive control, which has previously been shown to prevent CHF, and rats without LAD-ligation were used as a negative control. Furthermore, we screened and identified potential anti-inflammatory constituents by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) combined with NF-\u03baB activity luciferase reporter assay systems. Further cytokine detection confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of the potential NF-\u03baB inhibitors from YQFM.\nThe administration of YQFM significantly improved cardiac function and ameliorated the activity level of inflammatory mediators (such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1\u03b2) in CHF rats. Eight potential anti-inflammatory ingredients, ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rf, Rh1, Rc, Rb2, Ro, and Rg3, were characterized and confirmed.

{"title": "Inverse Relationship between Tumor Proliferation Markers and Connexin Expression in a Malignant Cardiac Tumor Originating from Mesenchymal Stem Cell Engineered Tissue in a Rat in vivo Model.", "abstract": "Recently, we demonstrated the beneficial effects of engineered heart tissues for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in rats. For further development of this technique we started to produce engineered tissue (ET) from mesenchymal stem cells. Interestingly, we observed a malignant tumor invading the heart with an inverse relationship between proliferation markers and connexin expression.\nCommercial CD54(+)/CD90(+)/CD34(-)/CD45(-) bone marrow derived mesenchymal rat stem cells (cBM-MSC), characterized were used for production of mesenchymal stem-cell-ET (MSC-ET) by suspending them in a collagen I, matrigel-mixture and cultivating for 14\u2009days with electrical stimulation. Three MSC-ET were implanted around the beating heart of adult rats for days. Another three MSC-ET were produced from freshly isolated rat bone marrow derived stem cells (sBM-MSC).\nThree weeks after implantation of the MSC-ETs the hearts were surgically excised. While in 5/6 cases the ET was clearly distinguishable and was found as a ring containing mostly connective tissue around the heart, in 1/6 the heart was completely surrounded by a huge, undifferentiated, pleomorphic tumor originating from the cMSC-ET (cBM-MSC), classified as a high grade malignant sarcoma. Quantitatively we found a clear inverse relationship between cardiac connexin expression (Cx43, Cx40, or Cx45) and increased Ki-67 expression (Cx43: p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Cx45: p\u2009<\u20090.03, Cx40: p\u2009<\u20090.014).

{"title": "Infarct-derived chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans prevent sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Sympathetic nerves can regenerate after injury to reinnervate target tissues. Sympathetic regeneration is well documented after chronic cardiac ischemia, so we were surprised that the cardiac infarct remained denervated following ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). We used mice to ask if the lack of sympathetic regeneration into the scar was due to blockade by inhibitory extracellular matrix within the infarct. We found that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) were present in the infarct after I-R, but not after chronic ischemia, and that CSPGs caused inhibition of sympathetic axon outgrowth in vitro. Ventricle explants after I-R and chronic ischemia stimulated sympathetic axon outgrowth that was blocked by nerve growth factor antibodies. However, growth in I-R cocultures was asymmetrical, with axons growing toward the heart tissue consistently shorter than axons growing in other directions. Growth toward I-R explants was rescued by adding chondroitinase ABC to the cocultures, suggesting that I-R infarct-derived CSPGs prevented axon extension. Sympathetic ganglia lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) were not inhibited by CSPGs or I-R explants in vitro, suggesting PTPRS is the major CSPG receptor in sympathetic neurons. To test directly if infarct-derived CSPGs prevented cardiac reinnervation, we performed I-R in ptprs-/- and ptprs+/- mice. Cardiac infarcts in ptprs-/- mice were hyperinnervated, while infarcts in ptprs+/- littermates were denervated, confirming that CSPGs prevent sympathetic reinnervation of the cardiac scar after I-R. This is the first example of CSPGs preventing sympathetic reinnervation of an autonomic target following injury, and may have important consequences for cardiac function and arrhythmia susceptibility after myocardial infarction.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2013-04-26", "authors": ["Ryan TGardner", "Beth AHabecker"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5866-12.2013\n10.1097/00005072-197304000-00006\n10.1016/0006-8993(85)90595-5\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06152.x\n10.1016/S0079-6123(01)32106-4\n10.1016/0092-8674(84)90276-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.14.1866\n10.1056/NEJMoa010519\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000025631.68522.9D\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.07.009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.12.066\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.16.1960\n10.1038/nn.3070\n10.1007/s00441-005-0144-6\n10.1074/jbc.M212480200\n10.1038/6859\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1737-11.2011\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2007.05.014\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4308-11.2011\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4523-03.2004\n10.1002/cne.903260305\n10.1002/cne.903590406\n10.1016/S0002-9149(97)89125-4\n10.1016/j.brainres.2006.09.054\n10.1016/0165-1838(85)90079-7\n10.1002/path.878\n10.1016/j.healun.2003.10.005\n10.1161/01.CIR.67.6.1356\n10.1073/pnas.0905437106\n10.1016/0896-6273(95)90148-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00768.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.01128.2009\n10.1007/BF01098780\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2007.03.029\n10.1038/sc.2008.74\n10.2967/jnumed.110.074971\n10.1016/j.mcn.2011.01.008\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.4.1161\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.002\n10.1042/BST0310335\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31823ac046\n10.1172/JCI26381\n10.1126/science.1178310\n10.1016/j.tins.2007.11.001\n10.1084/jem.20111749\n10.1038/nrn1326\n10.1016/0735-1097(89)90391-4\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62954-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3641-09.2009\n10.1002/jnr.490360209\n10.1152/ajpheart.01106.2011\n10.1006/exnr.1999.7018\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.2727\n10.1242/jcs.03016\n10.1161/01.RES.0000133678.22968.e3\n10.1016/S1566-0702(00)00209-5"}
{"title": "Competition for G\u03b2\u03b3 dimers mediates a specific cross-talk between stimulatory and inhibitory G protein \u03b1 subunits of the adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Heterotrimeric G proteins are key regulators of signaling pathways in mammalian cells. Beyond G protein-coupled receptors, the amount and mutual ratio of specific G protein \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits determine the G protein signaling. However, little is known about mechanisms that regulate the concentration and composition of G protein subunits at the plasma membrane. Here, we show a novel cross-talk between stimulatory and inhibitory G protein \u03b1 subunits (G\u03b1) that is mediated by G protein \u03b2\u03b3 dimers and controls the abundance of specific G\u03b1 subunits at the plasma membrane. Firstly, we observed in heart tissue from constitutively G\u03b1i2- and G\u03b1i3-deficient mice that the loss of G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b1i3 was accompanied by a slight increase in the protein content of the nontargeted G\u03b1i isoform. Therefore, we analyzed whether overexpression of selected G\u03b1 subunits conversely impairs endogenous G protein \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit levels in cardiomyocytes. Integration of overexpressed G\u03b1i2 subunits into heterotrimeric G proteins was verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Adenoviral expression of increasing amounts of G\u03b1i2 led to a reduction of G\u03b1i3 (up to 90\u00a0%) and G\u03b1s (up to 75\u00a0%) protein levels. Likewise, increasing amounts of adenovirally expressed G\u03b1s resulted in a linear 75\u00a0% decrease in both G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b1i3 protein levels. In contrast, overexpression of either G\u03b1i or G\u03b1s isoform did not influence the amount of G\u03b1o and G\u03b1q, both of which are not involved in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. The mRNA expression of the disappearing endogenous G\u03b1 subunits was not affected, indicating a posttranslational mechanism. Interestingly, the amount of endogenous G protein \u03b2\u03b3 dimers was not altered by any G\u03b1 overexpression. However, the increase of G\u03b2\u03b3 level by adenoviral expression prevented the loss of endogenous G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i3 in G\u03b1i2 overexpressing cardiomyocytes. Thus, our results provide evidence for a novel mechanism cross-regulating adenylyl cyclase-modulating G\u03b1i isoforms and G\u03b1s proteins.

Here we describe an extraction methodology based on tissue decellularization, which allows the biochemical subfractionation of extracellular proteins in cardiac tissue.

The method here describes the use of two isotope labeling techniques-isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and redox isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT)-to elucidate the cardiovascular redox-proteome changes and thioredoxin 1 (Trx1)-regulated protein network in cardiac-specific Trx1 transgenic mouse models. The strategy involves the use of an amine-labeling iTRAQ technique, gauging the global proteome changes in Trx1 transgenic mice at the protein level, while ICAT, labeling redox-sensitive cysteines, reveals the redox status of cysteine residues.

{"title": "Global protein quantification of mouse heart tissue based on the SILAC mouse.", "abstract": "Metabolic labeling of living organisms with stable isotopes has become a powerful tool for global protein quantitation. The SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) approach is based on the incorporation of nonradioactive-labeled isotopic forms of amino acids into cellular proteins. The effective SILAC labeling of immortalized cells and single-cell organisms (e.g., yeast and bacteria) was recently extended to more complex organisms, including worms, flies, and even rodents. The administration of a (13)C6-lysine (heavy) containing diet for one mouse generation leads to a complete exchange of the natural (light) isotope (12)C6-lysine. SILAC-labeled organisms are mainly used as a heavy \"spike-in\" standard into nonlabeled counterparts, and the combination with high-performance mass spectrometers allows for global proteomic screening. Here we used the fully labeled SILAC mice to identify proteins based on SILAC pairs from isolated cardiomyocytes, and we analyzed \u03b2-parvin-deficient hearts. Our approach confirmed the absence \u03b2-parvin and revealed simultaneously a clear up regulation of \u03b1-parvin in heart tissue. In this protocol, we describe the generation of a SILAC mouse colony and show two approaches to perform a proteome-wide analysis of heart tissue.

Herein, we report the optimization of a metabolite extraction method for mouse heart tissue for GC \u00d7 GC-TOFMS analysis. A recursive extraction experiment was initially performed to measure the extraction efficiency of representative target metabolites (sugars, tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, amino acids, lipid and signaling molecules) in the aqueous fraction of a three-phase extraction system involving tissue, methanol:water, and chloroform. Some metabolites suffered from incomplete extraction with a single extraction of \u2248 40 mg in 600 \u03bcl organic and 400 \u03bcl aqueous phases, possibly caused by saturation effects. Subsequent experiments, calibrating resulting metabolite signal to the mass of heart tissue extracted, demonstrated that doubling the solvent volumes and a lower tissue mass was needed to provide accurate relative quantification of the derivatized mouse heart metabolome.

We tested the hypothesis that dietary intake of saturated fat increases the levels of sphingolipids, namely ceramide and sphingomyelin in cardiac cell membranes that disrupt caveolae, specialized membrane micro-domains and important for cellular signaling. C57BL/6 mice were fed two high-fat diets: palmitate diet (21% total fat, 47% is palmitate), and MCT diet (21% medium-chain triglycerides, no palmitate). We established that high-palmitate feeding for 12 weeks leads to 40% and 50% increases in ceramide and sphingomyelin, respectively, in cellular membranes. Concomitant with sphingolipid accumulation, we observed a 40% reduction in systolic contractile performance. To explore the relationship of increased sphingolipids with caveolins, we analyzed caveolin protein levels and intracellular localization in isolated cardiomyocytes. In normal cardiomyocytes, caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 co-localize at the plasma membrane and the T-tubule system. However, mice maintained on palmitate lost 80% of caveolin-3, mainly from the T-tubule system. Mice maintained on MCT diet had a 90% reduction in caveolin-1. These data show that caveolin isoforms are sensitive to the lipid environment. These data are further supported by similar findings in human cardiac tissue samples from non-obese, obese, non-obese cardiomyopathic, and obese cardiomyopathic patients. To further elucidate the contractile dysfunction associated with the loss of caveolin-3, we determined the localization of the ryanodine receptor and found lower expression and loss of the striated appearance of this protein.

After 24\u2005h of preservation of hearts in each solution at 4\u00b0C, the beating of the isolated hearts was evaluated. The success rate, evaluation of beating, of cervical heart transplants using UW and ETK solution exceeded 70%, but those using other preservation solutions were lower (UW: 100%, ETK: 75%, EC: 42.86%, HTK: 14.29%, normal saline: 0%). Histological analysis of cervical heart-grafts after 3\u2005h preservation by myeloperoxidase (MPO), zona occludens-1(ZO-1), and caspase-3 immunostaining revealed different degrees of preservation damage in all grafts.\nOur novel assay system is simple and can test multiple solutions.

The purpose of the study was to assess both somatic and germline mutations in the GATA4 and NKX2.5 genes as well as to identify 3'UTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sites. We enrolled 30 patients (13 males; 13.4\u00b18.3 years) with non-syndromic CHD. GATA4 and NKX2.5 genes were screened in cardiac tissue of sporadic and in blood samples of familial cases. Computational methods were used to detect putative miRNAs in the 3'UTR region and to assess the Minimum Free Energy of hybridization (MFE, kcal/mol). Difference of MFEs (\u0394MFE) \u22654 kcal/mol between alleles was considered biologically relevant on miRNA binding. The sum of all \u0394MFEs (|\u0394MFEtot|=\u2211|\u0394MFE|) was calculated in order to predict the biological importance of SNPs binding more miRNAs. No evidence of novel GATA4 and NKX2.5 mutations was found both in sporadic and familial patients. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 27 putative miRNAs binding to identified SNPs in the 3'UTR of GATA4. \u0394MFE \u22654 kcal/mol between alleles was obtained for the +354A>C (miR-4299), +587A>G (miR-604), +1355G>A (miR-548v, miR-139-5p) and +1521C>G (miR-583, miR-3125, miR-3928) SNPs. The +1521C>G SNP showed the highest \u0394MFEtot (21.66 kcal/mol). Luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-583 was dose-dependently effective in regulating +1521 C allele compared with +1521 G allele. Based on the analysis of 100 CHD cases and 204 healthy newborns, the +1521 G allele was also associated with a lower risk of CHD (OR=0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p=0.03), likely due to the relatively low binding of the miRNA and high levels of protein.

We previously reported that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseous mediator, regulates renin synthesis and release in juxtaglomerular cells. The present study was designed to investigate whether H2S can protect against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced heart failure via inhibition of local renin activity in rat hearts.\nIn the present study, we found that an injection of ISO (150\u2009mg/kg) significantly increased plasma lactate dehydrogenase level and hypertrophy index and impaired LV end diastolic pressure. Treatment with NaHS (an H2S donor, 0.056\u2009mg/kg, daily) 3 days before and 2 weeks after the ISO injection attenuated the development of heart failure. Histological staining showed that NaHS decreased ISO-induced collagen deposition. Moreover, NaHS treatment reversed ISO-induced renin elevation in both plasma and LVs. Immunostaining analysis indicated that renin expression co-localized with mast cells in the ventricular tissues. Mast cell counts showed that NaHS treatment decreased the number of degranulated mast cells in cardiac tissue due to down-regulation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase protein expression and leukotriene B4 level. In addition, NaHS treatment also inhibited forskolin-induced renin degranulation from HMC-1.1 mast cells by lowering intracellular cAMP level.\nThis study provides evidence for a new pathway in H2S-induced cardioprotection against heart failure development.\nFor the first time, we demonstrated that H2S might protect heart during heart failure by suppression of local renin level through inhibition of both mast cell infiltration and renin degranulation.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2013-04-16", "authors": ["Yi-HongLiu", "MingLu", "Zhi-ZhongXie", "FeiHua", "LiXie", "Jun HongGao", "Yung-HuaKoh", "Jin-SongBian"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2012.4888"}
{"title": "Raf-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in adult Drosophila.", "abstract": "In response to stress and extracellular signals, the heart undergoes a process called cardiac hypertrophy during which cardiomyocytes increase in size. If untreated, cardiac hypertrophy can progress to overt heart failure that causes significant morbidity and mortality. The identification of molecular signals that cause or modify cardiomyopathies is necessary to understand how the normal heart progresses to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is essential for normal human cardiac function, and the inhibition of RTKs can cause dilated cardiomyopathies. However, neither investigations of activated RTK signaling pathways nor the characterization of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the adult fly heart has been previously described. Therefore, we developed strategies using Drosophila as a model to circumvent some of the complexities associated with mammalian models of cardiovascular disease. Transgenes encoding activated EGFR(A887T), Ras85D(V12) and Ras85D(V12S35), which preferentially signal to Raf, or constitutively active human or fly Raf caused hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as determined by decreased end diastolic lumen dimensions, abnormal cardiomyocyte fiber morphology and increased heart wall thicknesses. There were no changes in cardiomyocyte cell numbers. Additionally, activated Raf also induced an increase in cardiomyocyte ploidy compared with control hearts. However, preventing increases in cardiomyocyte ploidy using fizzy-related (Fzr) RNAi did not rescue Raf-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that Raf-mediated polyploidization is not required for cardiac hypertrophy. Similar to mammals, the cardiac-specific expression of RNAi directed against MEK or ERK rescued Raf-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. However, the cardiac-specific expression of activated ERK(D334N), which promotes hyperplasia in non-cardiac tissues, did not cause myocyte hypertrophy. These results suggest that ERK is necessary, but not sufficient, for Raf-mediated cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2013-04-13", "authors": ["LinYu", "JosephDaniels", "Alex EGlaser", "Matthew JWolf"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.011361"}

In the present study, we examined the deleterious effects of burn injury on heart tissue. We explored the effects of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) on cardiac injury in a murine burn injury model, with a focus on the protective effect of VNS on mitochondrial dysfunction in heart tissue. Mice were subjected to a 30% total body surface area, full-thickness steam burn followed by right cervical VNS for 10 min. and compared to burn alone. A separate group of mice were treated with the M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-AchR) antagonist 4-DAMP or phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 prior to burn and VNS. Heart tissue samples were collected at 6 and 24 hrs after injury to measure changes in apoptotic signalling pathways. Burn injury caused significant cardiac pathological changes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, mitochondrial swelling and decrease in myocardial ATP content at 6 and 24 hrs after injury. These changes were significantly attenuated by VNS. VNS inhibited release of pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to cytosol by increasing the expression of Bcl-2, and the phosphorylation level of Bad (pBad(136)) and Akt (pAkt(308)). These protective changes were blocked by 4-DAMP or LY294002.

LMNA gene encodes lamins A/C, proteins of the nuclear envelope. LMNA mutations cause DCM with conduction and/or rhythm defects. The pathomechanisms linking mutations to DCM remain to be elucidated. We investigated the phenotype and associated pathomechanisms of heterozygous Lmna(\u0394K32/+) (Het) knock-in mice, which carry a human mutation. Het mice developed a cardiac-specific phenotype. Two phases, with two different pathomechanisms, could be observed that lead to the development of cardiac dysfunction, DCM and death between 35 and 70 weeks of age. In young Het hearts, there was a clear reduction in lamin A/C level, mainly due to the degradation of toxic \u0394K32-lamin. As a side effect, lamin A/C haploinsufficiency probably triggers the cardiac remodelling. In older hearts, when DCM has developed, the lamin A/C level was normalized and associated with increased toxic \u0394K32-lamin expression. Crossing our mice with the Ub(G76V)-GFP ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) reporter mice revealed a heart-specific UPS impairment in Het. While UPS impairment itself has a clear deleterious effect on engineered heart tissue's force of contraction, it also leads to the nuclear aggregation of viral-mediated expression of \u0394K32-lamin. In conclusion, Het mice are the first knock-in Lmna model with cardiac-specific phenotype at the heterozygous state.

Hydrophilic pH-sensitive nanofiber hydrogel coassembled with hyaluronic acid performed best with both NRCs and hESC-CMs. Hydrophilic non-pH-sensitive nanofiber hydrogels supported the growth of NRCs; however, their ability to promote attachment and growth of hESC-CMs was limited. NRCs also grew on hydrophobic nanofiber hydrogels; however, the cell-supporting capacity of these hydrogels was inferior to that of the hydrophilic hydrogel materials.

Compared with SWOP, the relative abundance of mitochondrial proteins involved with electron transport chain (ETC) were reduced in HIB including NADH dehydrogenase, Cytochrome c reductase and oxidase, ATP synthase, and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase. Within chronically HIB heart tissue with reduced blood flow, the relative abundance of mitochondrial ETC proteins is decreased when compared with SWOP tissue. These data support the concept that HIB heart tissue subjected to chronically reduced blood flow is associated with a down-regulation in the expression of key mitochondrial proteins involved in electron transport.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2013-04-09", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas ACabrera", "Tammy AButterick", "Eric KLong", "Elizabeth AZiemba", "Lorraine BAnderson", "Cayla MDuffy", "WillemSluiter", "Dirk JDuncker", "JianyiZhang", "YingjieChen", "Herbert BWard", "Rosemary FKelly", "Edward OMcFalls"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.03.018"}

We have recently reported that autoantibodies against cardiac membrane proteins are present in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In this study, we examined the presence of autoimmunoreactive IgGs against lipid raft proteins in these patients. IgGs were purified from the sera of 10 patients and 7 normal controls. Cardiac lipid raft preparations were isolated from normal human heart tissue. The lipid raft-associated proteins were resolved by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted against IgGs from each subject. Protein spots that reacted specifically with patient IgGs were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Thirty-four such protein spots, and 72 unique proteins were identified. The targets of autoimmunoreactive IgGs include proteins associated with caveolae structure, adrenergic signaling, calcium signaling, cytostructures, chaperone and energy metabolism. Multiple pathways were involved including those that regulate caveolae-mediated signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, protein ubiquitination, and cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. Our results suggest that cardiac lipid raft-associated proteins are targets of autoimmunoreactive IgGs from patients with POTS.

In previous reports, the disease appeared in aged animals and had an unknown etiology. In the current study, we report a substrain of BALB/c mice (BALB/cByJ) that develops disease early and with high frequency. Here we analyzed hearts grossly to identify the presence and measure the severity of disease and to compare BALB/c substrains. Histologic analysis and fluorescent and immunofluorescent microscopy were used to characterize the calcinotic lesions. BALB/cByJ mice exhibited more frequent and severe calcium deposition than did BALB/c mice of other substrains (90% compared with 3% at 5 wk). At this age, lesions covered an average of 30% of the total ventricular surface area in BALB/cByJ mice, compared with less than 1% in other strains. In bone-marrow-chimeric mice, green fluorescent protein was used as a marker to show that the lesions contain an infiltration of cells of bone marrow origin. Lesion histology showed that calcium deposits were surrounded by fibrosis with interspersed immune cells. Lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes were all present. Internalization of the gap-junction protein connexin 43 was observed in myocytes adjacent to lesions. In conclusion, BALB/cByJ mice exhibit more frequent and severe dystrophic cardiac calcinosis than do other BALB/c substrains.

Although many studies have confirmed the damaging effect of ionizing radiation on the myocardium and cardiac endothelial structure and function, the molecular mechanism behind this damage is not yet elucidated. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism in heart tissue, has recently received great attention in the development of cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate radiation-induced cardiac damage in general and the role of PPAR alpha in this process in particular. C57BL/6 mice received local heart irradiation with X-ray doses of 8 and 16 gray (Gy) at the age of 8 weeks. The mice were sacrificed 16 weeks later. Radiation-induced changes in the cardiac proteome were quantified using the Isotope Coded Protein Label (ICPL) method followed by mass spectrometry and software analysis. Significant alterations were observed in proteins involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Ionizing radiation markedly changed the phosphorylation and ubiquitination status of PPAR alpha. This was reflected as decreased expression of its target genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory chain confirming the proteomics data. This study suggests that persistent alteration of cardiac metabolism due to impaired PPAR alpha activity contributes to the heart pathology after radiation.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2013-04-09", "authors": ["OmidAzimzadeh", "WolfgangSievert", "HakanSarioglu", "RameshYentrapalli", "ZarkoBarjaktarovic", "ArundhathiSriharshan", "MariusUeffing", "DirkJanik", "MichaelaAichler", "Michael JAtkinson", "GabrieleMulthoff", "SoileTapio"], "doi": "10.1021/pr400071g"}

Vegfa and Hif1a expression levels were measured by qPCR and compared between the F1 offspring from the reciprocal crosses.\nWe found significant differences in the expression of Vegfa in F1 offspring (AJ129 and 129AJ mice) of the reciprocal crosses between AJ and 129 mice. Offspring of male AJ mice had significantly higher expression of Vegfa than offspring of male 129 mice (p = 0.006). This difference in expression was not the result of preferential allele expression (allelic imbalance). Expression of Hif1a, a transcriptional regulator of Vegfa expression, was also higher in F1 offspring of an AJ father (p = 0.004).\nDifferences in Vegfa and Hif1a gene expression are likely the result of an upstream angiogenic regulator gene that is influenced by the parent of origin.

{"title": "Role of Intracardiac echocardiography in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.", "abstract": "In the recent years, several new evidences support catheter-based ablation as a treatment modality of atrial fibrillation (AF). Based on a plenty of different applications, intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is now a well-established technology in complex electrophysiological procedures, in particular in AF ablation. ICE contributes to improve the efficacy and safety of such procedures defining the anatomical structures involved in ablation procedures and monitoring in real time possible complications. In particular ICE allows: a correct identification of the endocardial structures; a guidance of transseptal puncture; an assessment of accurate placement of the circular mapping catheter; an indirect evaluation of evolving lesions during radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery via visualization of micro and macrobubbles tissue heating; assessment of catheter contact with cardiac tissues. Recently, also the feasibility of the integration of electroanatomical mapping (EAM) and intracardiac echocardiography has been demonstrated, combining accurate real time anatomical information with electroanatomical data. As a matter of fact, different techniques and ablation strategies have been developed throughout the years. In the setting of balloon-based ablation systems, recently adopted by an increasing number of centers, ICE might have a role in the choice of appropriate balloon size and to confirm accurate occlusion of pulmonary veins. Furthermore, in the era of minimally fluoroscopic ablation, ICE has successfully provided a contribute in reducing fluoroscopy time.

{"title": "New insights into mechanisms of cardioprotection mediated by thyroid hormones.", "abstract": "Heart failure represents the final common outcome in cardiovascular diseases. Despite significant therapeutic advances, morbidity and mortality of heart failure remain unacceptably high. Heart failure is preceded and sustained by a process of structural remodeling of the entire cardiac tissue architecture. Prevention or limitation of cardiac remodeling in the early stages of the process is a crucial step in order to ameliorate patient prognosis. Acquisition of novel pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac remodeling is therefore required to develop more efficacious therapeutic strategies. Among all neuroendocrine systems, thyroid hormone seems to play a major homeostatic role in cardiovascular system. In these years, accumulating evidence shows that the \"low triiodothyronine\" syndrome is a strong prognostic, independent predictor of death in patients affected by both acute and chronic heart disease. In experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy or myocardial infarction, alterations in the thyroid hormone signaling, concerning cardiac mitochondrion, cardiac interstitium, and vasculature, have been suggested to be related to heart dysfunction. The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling.

The quantification of the mechanical properties of the myocardium, a primordial indicator of the viability of the cardiac tissue, is a key element in patient's care. Despite an incremental utilization of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for cardiac tissue characteristics and function, the link between multi-parametric MRI and the mechanical properties of the heart has not been established. We sought to determine the parametric relationship between the myocardial mechanical properties and the MR parameters. The specific aim was to develop a reproducible evaluative quantitative tool of the mechanical properties of cardiac tissue using multi-parametric MRI associated to principal component analysis.\nSamples from porcine hearts were submitted to a multi-parametric MRI acquisition followed by a uniaxial tensile test. Multi linear regressions were performed between dependent (Young's modulus E) and independent (relaxation times T1, T2 and T2*, magnetization transfer ratio MTR, apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and fractional anisotropy FA) variables. A principal component analysis was used to convert the set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables.\nValues of 46.1 \u00b1 12.7 MPa for E, 729 \u00b1 21 ms for T1, 61 \u00b1 6 ms for T2, 26 \u00b1 7 for T2*, 35 \u00b1 5% for MTR x 100, 33.8 \u00b1 4.7 for FA x 10\u207b\u00b2, and 5.85 \u00b1 0.21 mm\u00b2/s for ADC x 10\u207b\u2074 were measured. Multi linear regressions showed that only 45% of E can be explained by the MRI parameters. The principal component analysis reduced our seven variables to two principal components with a cumulative variability of 63%, which increased to 80% when considering the third principal component.\nThe proposed multi-parametric MRI protocol associated to principal component analysis is a promising tool for the evaluation of mechanical properties within the left ventricle in the in vitro porcine model.

As a result, an organized vascular network that is optimal for tissue perfusion is created through not only the generation of new blood vessels but also the remodeling and maintenance of endothelial cells via apoptotic and cell survival pathways. Here, we show that UBIAD1, a vitamin K2/menaquinone-4 biosynthetic enzyme, functions cell-autonomously to regulate endothelial cell survival and maintain vascular homeostasis. From a recent vascular transgene-assisted zebrafish forward genetic screen, we have identified a ubiad1 mutant, reddish/reh, which exhibits cardiac edema as well as cranial hemorrhages and vascular degeneration owing to defects in endothelial cell survival. These findings are further bolstered by the expression of UBIAD1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human heart tissue, as well as the rescue of the reh cardiac and vascular phenotypes with either zebrafish or human UBIAD1. Furthermore, we have discovered that vitamin K2, which is synthesized by UBIAD1, can also rescue the reh vascular phenotype but not the reh cardiac phenotype. Additionally, warfarin-treated zebrafish, which have decreased active vitamin K, display similar vascular degeneration as reh mutants, but exhibit normal cardiac function. Overall, these findings reveal an essential role for UBIAD1-generated vitamin K2 to maintain endothelial cell survival and overall vascular homeostasis; however, an alternative UBIAD1/vitamin K-independent pathway may regulate cardiac function.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2013-03-28", "authors": ["Jeffrey MHegarty", "HongboYang", "Neil CChi"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.093112"}

Although the Parkinson-susceptibility gene, Parkinson protein 7/DJ-1 (DJ-1), has been linked to the regulation of oxidative stress, the exact mechanism by which this occurs and its in vivo relevance have remained elusive. In the heart, oxidative stress is a major contributor to the development of heart failure (HF). Therefore, we hypothesized that DJ-1 inhibits the pathological consequences of ROS production in the heart, the organ with the highest oxidative burden. We report that DJ-1 is highly expressed in normal heart tissue but is markedly reduced in end-stage human HF. DJ-1-deficient mice subjected to oxidative stress by transaortic banding exhibited exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy and susceptibility to developing HF. This was accompanied by a Trp53 (p53)-dependent decrease in capillary density, an excessive oxidation of DNA, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, key events in the development of HF. Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and progressive respiratory chain deficiency were also evident in cardiomyocytes lacking DJ-1.

{"title": "A discrete electromechanical model for human cardiac tissue: effects of stretch-activated currents and stretch conditions on restitution properties and spiral wave dynamics.", "abstract": "We introduce an electromechanical model for human cardiac tissue which couples a biophysical model of cardiac excitation (Tusscher, Noble, Noble, Panfilov, 2006) and tension development (adjusted Niederer, Hunter, Smith, 2006 model) with a discrete elastic mass-lattice model. The equations for the excitation processes are solved with a finite difference approach, and the equations of the mass-lattice model are solved using Verlet integration. This allows the coupled problem to be solved with high numerical resolution. Passive mechanical properties of the mass-lattice model are described by a generalized Hooke's law for finite deformations (Seth material). Active mechanical contraction is initiated by changes of the intracellular calcium concentration, which is a variable of the electrical model. Mechanical deformation feeds back on the electrophysiology via stretch-activated ion channels whose conductivity is controlled by the local stretch of the medium. We apply the model to study how stretch-activated currents affect the action potential shape, restitution properties, and dynamics of spiral waves, under constant stretch, and dynamic stretch caused by active mechanical contraction. We find that stretch conditions substantially affect these properties via stretch-activated currents. In constantly stretched medium, we observe a substantial decrease in conduction velocity, and an increase of action potential duration; whereas, with dynamic stretch, action potential duration is increased only slightly, and the conduction velocity restitution curve becomes biphasic. Moreover, in constantly stretched medium, we find an increase of the core size and period of a spiral wave, but no change in rotation dynamics; in contrast, in the dynamically stretching medium, we observe spiral drift. Our results may be important to understand how altered stretch conditions affect the heart's functioning.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["Louis DWeise", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0059317"}

The mechanisms of PAR induced myocardial dysfunction and the impact of antioxidant protection was investigated in rat ventricular myocytes.\nForty adult male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups receiving the following daily intraperitoneal injections for 3 weeks: Group 1 PAR (10 mg/kg), Control Group 2 saline, Group 3 vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and Group 4 PAR (10 mg/kg) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg).

We compared (immuno) histology and electrophysiology of organ explant cultures to both freshly isolated neonatal rat ventricular tissue and monolayers. (Immuno) histologic studies showed that organ explant cultures retained their fiber orientation, and that expression patterns of \u03b1-actinin, connexin-43, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin did not change during culture. Intracellular voltage recordings showed that spontaneous beating was rare in organ explant cultures (20%) and freshly isolated tissue (17%), but common (82%) in monolayers. Accordingly, resting membrane potential was -83.9\u00b14.4 mV in organ explant cultures, -80.5\u00b13.5 mV in freshly isolated tissue, and -60.9\u00b14.3 mV in monolayers.

Imaging tools can help implant cells in areas of the heart most receptive to stem cell therapy and monitor the efficacy of treatment by reporting the viability, location, and number of implanted stem cells. We describe a multimodal, silica-based nanoparticle that can be used for cell sorting (fluorescence), real-time guided cell implantation ultrasound, and high-resolution, long-term monitoring by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The nanoparticle agent increased the ultrasound and MRI contrast of labeled human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) 700 and 200% versus unlabeled cells, respectively, and allowed cell imaging in animal models for 13 days after implantation. The agent had no significant impact on hMSC cell metabolic activity, proliferation, or pluripotency, and it increased the production of many paracrine factors implicated in cardiac repair. Electron microscopy and ultrasound imaging suggest that the mechanism of action is in vivo aggregation of the 300-nm silica nanoparticles into larger silica frameworks that amplify the ultrasound backscatter. The detection limit in cardiac tissue was 250,000 hMSCs via MRI and 70,000 via ultrasound.

We verify and characterize the assembly of poly(l-lysine) (PLL)/alginate, PLL/poly(l-glutamic acid), PLL/poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA), and PLL/cholesterol-modified PMA (PMAc) films, and assess the myoblast and hepatocyte adhesion to these coatings using different numbers of polyelectrolyte layers. The assembly of liposome-containing multilayered coatings is monitored by QCM-D, and the films are visualized using microscopy. The myoblast and hepatocyte adhesion to these films using PLL/PMAc or poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)/poly(allyl amine hydrochloride) (PAH) as capping layers is evaluated. Finally, the uptake of fluorescent lipids from the surface by these cells is demonstrated and compared. The activity of this liposome-containing coating is confirmed for both cell lines by trapping the small cytotoxic compound thiocoraline within the liposomes. It is shown that the biological response depends on the number of capping layers, and is different for the two cell lines when the compound is delivered from the surface, while it is similar when administered from solution. Taken together, we demonstrate the potential of liposomes as drug deposits in multilayered films for surface-mediated drug delivery.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2013-03-22", "authors": ["Martin ELynge", "Marie BaekgaardLaursen", "LeticiaHosta-Rigau", "Bettina E BJensen", "RyosukeOgaki", "Anton A ASmith", "Alexander NZelikin", "BrigitteSt\u00e4dler"], "doi": "10.1021/am4006868"}

{"title": "Fatty acid binding protein 3 (fabp3) is associated with insulin, lipids and cardiovascular phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome through epigenetic modifications in a Northern European family population.", "abstract": "Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) play regulatory roles at the nexus of lipid metabolism and signaling. Dyslipidemia in clinical manifestation frequently co-occurs with obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension in the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Animal studies have suggested FABPs play regulatory roles in expressing MetS phenotypes. In our family cohort of Northern European descent, transcript levels in peripheral white blood cells (PWBCs) of a key FABPs, FABP3, is correlated with the MetS leading components. However, evidence supporting the functions of FABPs in humans using genetic approaches has been scarce, suggesting FABPs may be under epigenetic regulation. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that CpG methylation status of a key regulator of lipid homeostasis, FABP3, is a quantitative trait associated with status of MetS phenotypes in humans.\nWe used a mass-spec based quantitative method, EpiTYPER\u00ae, to profile a CpG island that extends from the promoter to the first exon of the FABP3 gene in our family-based cohort of Northern European descent (n=517). We then conducted statistical analysis of the quantitative relationship of CpG methylation and MetS measures following the variance-component association model. Heritability of each methylation and the effect of age and sex on CpG methylation were also assessed in our families.\nWe find that methylation levels of individual CpG units and the regional average are heritable and significantly influenced by age and sex. Regional methylation was strongly associated with plasma total cholesterol (p=0.00028) and suggestively associated with LDL-cholesterol (p=0.00495). Methylation at individual units was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity, lipid particle sizing and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.0028, corrected for multiple testing for each trait). Peripheral white blood cell (PWBC) expression of FABP3 in a separate group of subjects (n=128) negatively correlated with adverse profiles of metabolism (\u03b2WHR=-0.72; \u03b2LDL-c=-0.53) while positively correlated with plasma adiponectin (\u03b2=0.24). Further, we show that differential methylation of FABP3 affects binding activity with nuclear proteins from heart tissue. This region that we found under methylation regulation overlaps with a region actively modified by histone codes in the newly available ENCODE data.\nOur findings suggest that DNA methylation of FABP3 strongly influences MetS, and this may have important implications for cardiovascular disease.", "journal": "BMC medical genomics", "date": "2013-03-21", "authors": ["YiZhang", "Jack WKent", "AdamLee", "DianaCerjak", "OmarAli", "RobertDiasio", "MichaelOlivier", "JohnBlangero", "Melanie ACarless", "Ahmed HKissebah"], "doi": "10.1186/1755-8794-6-9\n10.1016/S0955-2863(03)00098-6\n10.3132/dvdr.2007.003\n10.1074/jbc.R110.135210\n10.1097/01.mol.0000180166.08196.07\n10.1373/clinchem.2005.062463\n10.1007/s12020-009-9243-6\n10.1073/pnas.0400782101\n10.1152/ajpendo.00287.2004\n10.2527/jas.2006-755\n10.2337/diabetes.54.11.3133\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4140-09.2010\n10.1253/circj.71.1452\n10.1186/1475-2840-10-37\n10.1002/path.1711700110\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000111245.75752.C6\n10.1016/0026-0495(84)90164-1\n10.1172/JCI112758\n10.1038/ajh.2008.40\n10.1002/bies.10277\n10.1038/nbt.1685\n10.1093/carcin/bgp220\n10.1161/01.RES.0000258855.60637.58\n10.1017/S000711450769196X\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.04.023\n10.1159/000336664\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.034\n10.1093/hmg/ddr472\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014040\n10.1007/s00125-008-1034-8\n10.1007/s00125-007-0916-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.9.2159\n10.1194/jlr.M001404\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00038.2010\n10.1073/pnas.97.26.14478\n10.2337/diabetes.38.12.1512\n10.1016/j.jri.2005.03.005\n10.1159/000335102\n10.1038/ng2119\n10.1251/bpo89\n10.1086/301844\n10.1080/01621459.1987.10478472\n10.1002/gepi.20331\n10.1161/01.RES.84.3.276\n10.1038/ng.75\n10.1001/jama.294.14.1773\n10.1007/s12325-011-0088-z\n10.2165/00129784-200505060-00005\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1038/nature11212\n10.1038/nature11232\n10.1101/gr.136101.111\n10.1093/nar/gkp961\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017121\n10.1007/978-1-61779-316-5_20\n10.1007/978-1-60761-753-2_27"}

Rabbits were treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an effective GSH-depleting compound. BSO treatment significantly reduced GSH and increased MDA (malondialdehyde) levels.

Unilateral reduction of Bmp signaling results in lower expression of nonmuscle myosin II and higher cell motility on the left, driving asymmetric displacement of the entire cardiac field.

{"title": "Early cardiac changes in a rat model of prediabetes: brain natriuretic peptide overexpression seems to be the best marker.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is defined as structural and functional changes in the myocardium due to metabolic and cellular abnormalities induced by diabetes mellitus (DM). The impact of prediabetic conditions on the cardiac tissue remains to be elucidated. The goal of this study was to elucidate whether cardiac dysfunction is already present in a state of prediabetes, in the presence of insulin resistance, and to unravel the underlying mechanisms, in a rat model without obesity and hypertension as confounding factors.\nTwo groups of 16-week-old Wistar rats were tested during a 9\u2009week protocol: high sucrose (HSu) diet group (n\u2009=\u20097) - rats receiving 35% of sucrose in drinking water vs the vehicle control group (n\u2009=\u20097). The animal model was characterized in terms of body weight (BW) and the glycemic, insulinemic and lipidic profiles. The following parameters were assessed to evaluate possible early cardiac alterations and underlying mechanisms: blood pressure, heart rate, heart and left ventricle (LV) trophism indexes, as well as the serum and tissue protein and/or the mRNA expression of markers for fibrosis, hypertrophy, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, endothelial function, inflammation and oxidative stress.\nThe HSu-treated rats presented normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) but impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (P\u2009<\u20090.01), confirming this rat model as prediabetic. Furthermore, although hypertriglyceridemia (P\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed, obesity and hypertension were absent. Regarding the impact of the HSu diet on the cardiac tissue, our results indicated that 9\u2009weeks of treatment might be associated with initial cardiac changes, as suggested by the increased LV weight/BW ratio (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and a remarkable brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA overexpression (P\u2009<\u20090.01), together with a marked trend for an upregulation of other important mediators of fibrosis, hypertrophy, angiogenesis and endothelial lesions, as well as oxidative stress. The inflammatory and apoptotic markers measured were unchanged.\nThis animal model of prediabetes/insulin resistance could be an important tool to evaluate the early cardiac impact of dysmetabolism (hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance with fasting normoglycemia), without confounding factors such as obesity and hypertension.

Traditionally, this behavior has been modeled with a monodomain approach, in which the mechanical properties of the intracellular and extracellular spaces are averaged together. We consider a mechanical bidomain model of cardiac tissue in which the mechanics of the intracellular and extracellular spaces are considered individually with the two spaces coupled by a spring constant. We find two normal modes of oscillation: one in which the intracellular and extracellular spaces oscillate together (a monodomain mode) and the other in which they oscillate in opposition (a bidomain mode). These two modes have unique dispersion relationships. In the extreme approximation of equal shear moduli and mass densities of the intracellular and extracellular spaces, the dispersion in the bidomain mode depends on the spring constant, while it does not in the monodomain mode.", "journal": "Physical review.

Three HVPMITs were tested valves and another three original biological heart valve prostheses acted as reference valves. The pulsatile-flow parameters (including mean pressure drop, regurgitant percentage of stroke volume, and effective orifice area) were tested in a pulse duplicator according to the methods listed in ISO5840-2005 and GB 12279-2008. The results demonstrated that the regurgitant percentage of stroke volume of tested valves was up to 13%. It was significantly higher than that of the reference valves. This result suggested that paravalvular leakage had occurred in the tested valves. It was found in the further analysis that because HVPMIT was not sewn into the heart tissue when the HVPMIT was implanted in vivo and there was not a sewing ring in the HVPMIT, when tested valves were fixed in the pulse duplicator, some gaps might exist between the stent of HVPMIT and the fix gasket, and the paravalvular leakage could therefore take place through these gaps. This study demonstrated that there are significant differences in the shape, structure, fixation in vivo and clinical operational methods between HVPMIT and original biological heart valve prostheses. It is necessary to establish new test methods which adapt for HVPMIT to evaluate its pulsatile-flow performance according to its own features.", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "date": "2013-03-16", "authors": ["JinglongTang", "ShuoWang", "LiLiu", "JianWang", "ChunrenWang"], "doi": null}

The potential clinical applicability of these findings is based on the minimal regenerative potential of the adult human heart and the limited availability of human heart tissue. An initial but mandatory step toward clinical application of this approach is to establish conditions for conversion of adult human fibroblasts to a cardiac phenotype. Toward this goal, we sought to determine the optimal combination of factors necessary and sufficient for direct myocardial reprogramming of human fibroblasts. Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts. After maintenance in culture for 4-11 wk, human fibroblasts reprogrammed with these proteins and microRNAs displayed sarcomere-like structures and calcium transients, and a small subset of such cells exhibited spontaneous contractility. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by expression of a broad range of cardiac genes and suppression of nonmyocyte genes. These findings indicate that human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiac-like myocytes by forced expression of cardiac transcription factors with muscle-specific microRNAs and represent a step toward possible therapeutic application of this reprogramming approach.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2013-03-15", "authors": ["Young-JaeNam", "KunhuaSong", "XiangLuo", "EdwardDaniel", "KalebLambeth", "KatherineWest", "Joseph AHill", "J MichaelDiMaio", "Linda ABaker", "RhondaBassel-Duby", "Eric NOlson"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1301019110"}

After 4\u00a0weeks of immunization, the rats were fed with 5% MLD for 4\u00a0weeks. By the end of the study, echocardiography was performed to assess the myocardial dimensions. The heart tissue was used for histopathology and Western blotting analyses.\nOur study showed that the postmyocarditis rats exhibited increased oxidative stress when compared with the control rats. MLD supplementation suppressed this change, compared with vehicle treatment. In addition, postmyocarditis rats showed significant elevation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, which were prevented by the MLD supplementation. Similarly the vehicle-treated rats suffered with the adverse myocardial remodeling in the form of fibrosis as evidenced by the Azan-Mallory staining and immunohistochemistry for collagen-III levels, compared with the control rats. However, MLD treatment not only markedly attenuated cardiac fibrosis, but also improved the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Interestingly, the myocardial levels of endothelin-1, activated members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly attenuated by MLD, indicating that the antihypertrophic effects of MLD are partially mediated via endothelin-1, MAPK, and VEGF pathway.\nCollectively, these results suggest that supplementation of rats with 5% MLD has the ability to regulate cardiac remodeling and improves cardiac function and hence contributes to prevent the development of postmyocarditis\u00a0dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular therapeutics", "date": "2013-03-14", "authors": ["SomasundaramArumugam", "SayakaMito", "Rajarajan AThandavarayan", "Vijayasree VGiridharan", "VigneshwaranPitchaimani", "VengadeshprabhuKaruppagounder", "MeileiHarima", "MayumiNomoto", "KenjiSuzuki", "KenichiWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1111/1755-5922.12029"}

The blueberry extract showed higher total phenols and anthocyanins contents, scavenging activity of superoxide radical and systolic and diastolic function was improved, TBARS diminished, GSH was partially preserved, and both NOS and Akt expression increased in hearts treated with the extract. These beneficial effects were lost when eNOS was inhibited.

Cardiac glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was assessed spectrophotometrically. Expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) subunits-SUR2A and Kir6.2-were examined by real-time PCR and Western blotting.

Mechanically, it is novel for us to find down-regulation of KATP subunits gene expression in cardiac tissue after administration of ADR or Se deficiency, and more significant inhibition of cardiac KATP gene expression was identified after co-administration of ADR and Se deficiency. Furthermore, cardiac toxicity of ADR was found alleviated by Se supplementation, accompanied by restoring of cardiac GPx activity and cardiac KATP gene expression.

Dried leaves of Artemisia annua have been used in Oriental medicine due to their antimicrobial activities. In the current study, the effect of including A. annua in broiler diets on hindgut and ceca pH, lipid oxidation products, and phenolic content of dark and white meat, and bird performance were investigated. A total of 96 broiler chicks were kept in 48 cages. Two cages with 2 birds per each cage are considered as 1 replicate, and there were 8 replications per treatment. The birds were fed corn-soy diets containing 0% (control), 2% (ART2), or 4% (ART4) dried A. annua leaves from d 14 through d 42. Cecal digesta pH was the lowest in birds fed the ART4 diet (P < 0.02), whereas the pH of ileal digesta was the lowest in ART2 (P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation products measured as TBA reactive substances (TBARS) were lower in the breast and thigh muscle of birds fed ART2 and ART4 diets compared with the control (P < 0.0001). No difference was found in total fat content of the liver, abdominal fat pads, or breast or thigh muscle content (P > 0.05). Artemisia annua addition did not affect final BW, weight gain, feed consumption, carcass weight, or feed:gain. No difference was observed in the relative weight of liver, abdominal fat, spleen, or heart tissue.

This study investigated whether inflammation exacerbated the progression of cardiac fibrosis in high-fat-fed apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice via endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Methods Twenty-four male ApoE KO mice were divided into normal chow diet (Control), high-fat diet (HFD), or high-fat diet plus 10% casein injection (inflamed) groups for 8 weeks. The body weight of ApoE KO mice was measured at each week. The lipid profile and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels were examined using clinical biochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. Cardiac lipid and collagen accumulation was visualised with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome staining. EndMT-related molecule expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results SAA levels were increased in the inflamed group compared with the HFD and control groups, suggesting that inflammation was successfully induced. There were no differences in body weight among three groups at each week. Interestingly, inflammation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels compared with the HFD mice. However, both foam cell formation in cardiac blood vessels and cardiac collagen deposition were increased in the inflamed group, as demonstrated by HE and Masson trichrome staining. Furthermore, inflammation reduced protein expression of CD31 and increased protein expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen I, which contribute to cardiac EndMT.

{"title": "Optical imaging predicts mechanical properties during decellularization of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Decellularization of xenogeneic hearts offers an acellular, naturally occurring, 3D scaffold that may aid in the development of an engineered human heart tissue. However, decellularization impacts the structural and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which can strongly influence a cell response during recellularization. We hypothesized that multiphoton microscopy (MPM), combined with image correlation spectroscopy (ICS), could be used to characterize the structural and mechanical properties of the decellularized cardiac matrix in a noninvasive and nondestructive fashion. Whole porcine hearts were decellularized for 7 days by four different solutions of Trypsin and/or Triton. The compressive modulus of the cardiac ECM decreased to < 20% of that of the native tissue in three of the four conditions (range 2-8\u2009kPa); the modulus increased by -150% (range 125-150\u2009kPa) in tissues treated with Triton only. The collagen and elastin content decreased steadily over time for all four decellularization conditions. The ICS amplitude of second harmonic generation (SHG, ASHG) collagen images increased in three of the four decellularization conditions characterized by a decrease in fiber density; the ICS amplitude was approximately constant in tissues treated with Triton only. The ICS ratio (R(SHG), skew) of collagen images increased significantly in the two conditions characterized by a loss of collagen crimping or undulations. The ICS ratio of two-photon fluorescence (TPF, R(TPF)) elastin images decreased in three of the four conditions, but increased significantly in Triton-only treated tissue characterized by retention of densely packed elastin fibers. There were strong linear relationships between both the log of A(SHG) (R(2) = 0.86) and R(TPF) (R(2) = 0.92) with the compressive modulus. Using these variables, a linear model predicts the compressive modulus: E=73.9 \u00d7 Log(A(SHG))+70.1 \u00d7 R(TPF) - 131 (R(2) = 0.94). This suggests that the collagen content and elastin alignment determine the mechanical properties of the ECM.

Although reported to be highly expressed in the cardiac tissue, the biological function of NDRG2 in the heart remains to be established. Insulin exerts protective effects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we examined the changes in phosphorylation of NDRG2, a novel substrate and phosphoprotein of Akt, in insulin-induced protection against myocardial I/R. Rat hearts were subjected to 30\u00a0min regional ischemia followed by reperfusion with or without insulin at the onset of reperfusion. Reperfusion with insulin inhibited myocardial apoptosis and reduced infarct size, as well as significantly up-regulated myocardial Akt and NDRG2 phosphorylation levels compared with the I/R group. These effects of insulin were blocked by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or Akt inhibitor. To further ascertain the role of NDRG2 in insulin-induced cardioprotection, cardiomyocytes were transduced with a lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting NDRG2 (loss-of-function), which rendered the cells more susceptible to I/R injury and significantly blunted the anti-apoptotic effect of insulin. Moreover, the NDRG2 shRNA lentivirus was tested in vivo, and NDRG2 knockdown aggravated myocardial I/R injury and attenuated the insulin-mediated cardioprotection against I/R injury. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role of PI3K/Akt/NDRG2 signaling in the cardioprotective effect of insulin.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2013-03-07", "authors": ["ZhongchanSun", "GuangTong", "NanMa", "JianyingLi", "XiujuanLi", "ShuangLi", "JingyuZhou", "LizeXiong", "FengCao", "LiboYao", "HaichangWang", "LanShen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-013-0341-5"}

Endothelial lipase is another member of the triglyceride lipase family and hydrolyzes high-density lipoproteins. Although endothelial lipase is expressed in the heart, its function remains unclear. We assessed the role of endothelial lipase in the genesis of heart failure. Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy was generated in endothelial lipase(-/-) and wild-type mice by ascending aortic banding. Endothelial lipase expression in cardiac tissues was markedly elevated in the early phase of cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice, whereas lipoprotein lipase expression was significantly reduced. Endothelial lipase(-/-) mice showed more severe systolic dysfunction with left-ventricular dilatation compared with wild-type mice in response to pressure overload. The expression of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation-related genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, was significantly lower in the heart of endothelial lipase(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Also, endothelial lipase(-/-) mice had lower myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels than wild-type mice after aortic banding. In cultured cardiomyocytes, endothelial lipase was upregulated by inflammatory stimuli, whereas lipoprotein lipase was downregulated. Endothelial lipase-overexpression in cardiomyocytes resulted in an upregulation of fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes and intracellular adenosine triphosphate accumulation in the presence of high-density lipoprotein. Endothelial lipase may act as an alternative candidate to provide fatty acids to the heart and regulate cardiac function.

CSQ2 is biosynthesized in rough ER around cardiomyocyte nuclei and then traffics transversely across SR subcompartments. During biosynthesis, CSQ2 undergoes N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2. In mammalian heart, CSQ2 molecules subsequently undergo extensive mannose trimming by ER mannosidase(s), a posttranslational process that often regulates protein breakdown. We analyzed the intact purified CSQ2 from mongrel canine heart tissue by electrospray mass spectrometry. The average molecular mass of CSQ2 in normal mongrel dogs was 46,306 \u00b1 41 Da, corresponding to glycan trimming of 3-5 mannoses, depending upon the phosphate content. We tested whether CSQ2 glycan structures would be altered in heart tissue from mongrel dogs induced into heart failure (HF) by two very different experimental treatments, rapid ventricular pacing or repeated coronary microembolizations. Similarly dramatic changes in mannose trimming were found in both types of induced HF, despite the different cardiomyopathies producing the failure. Unique to all samples analyzed from HF dog hearts, 20-40 % of all CSQ2 contained glycans that had minimal mannose trimming (Man9,8). Analyses of tissue samples showed decreases in CSQ2 protein levels per unit levels of mRNA for tachypaced heart tissue, also indicative of altered turnover. Quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen tissue sections suggested that no changes in CSQ2 levels occurred across the width of the cell.

{"title": "NO triggers RGS4 degradation to coordinate angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte growth.", "abstract": "Myocardial hypertrophy is an adaptation to increased hemodynamic demands. An increase in heart tissue must be matched by a corresponding expansion of the coronary vasculature to maintain and adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients for the heart. The physiological mechanisms that underlie the coordination of angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte growth are unknown. We report that induction of myocardial angiogenesis promotes cardiomyocyte growth and cardiac hypertrophy through a novel NO-dependent mechanism. We used transgenic, conditional overexpression of placental growth factor (PlGF) in murine cardiac tissues to stimulate myocardial angiogenesis and increase endothelial-derived NO release. NO production, in turn, induced myocardial hypertrophy by promoting proteasomal degradation of regulator of G protein signaling type 4 (RGS4), thus relieving the repression of the G\u03b2\u03b3/PI3K\u03b3/AKT/mTORC1 pathway that stimulates cardiomyocyte growth. This hypertrophic response was prevented by concomitant transgenic expression of RGS4 in cardiomyocytes. NOS inhibitor L-NAME also significantly attenuated RGS4 degradation, and reduced activation of AKT/mTORC1 signaling and induction of myocardial hypertrophy in PlGF transgenic mice, while conditional cardiac-specific PlGF expression in eNOS knockout mice did not induce myocardial hypertrophy.

To investigate the mechanistic basis, we performed global metabolomic analysis of myocardial tissues from the left ventricles of J2N-k cardiomyopathic hamsters. This model exhibits symptoms similar to those of human DCM, owing to the deletion of the \u03b4-sarcoglycan gene. Charged and lipid metabolites were measured by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography MS(/MS), respectively, and J2N-k hamsters were compared with J2N-n healthy controls at 4 (presymptomatic phase) and 16weeks (symptomatic) of age. Disturbances in membrane phospholipid homeostasis were initiated during the presymptomatic phase. Significantly different levels of charged metabolites, occurring mainly in the symptomatic phase, were mapped to primary metabolic pathways. Reduced levels of metabolites in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, together with large decreases in major triacylglycerol levels, suggested that decreased energy production leads to cardiac contractile dysfunction in the symptomatic phase. A mild reduction in glutathione and a compensatory increase in ophthalmate levels suggest increased oxidative stress in diseased tissues, which was confirmed by histochemical staining. Increased levels of 4 eicosanoids, including prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1, in the symptomatic phase suggested activation of the protective response pathways.

In ZDFs, hemin administration increased HO activity; normalized glycemia; potentiated insulin signaling by enhancing insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt; suppressed pericardial adiposity, cardiac hypertrophy, and left ventricular longitudinal muscle fiber thickness, a pathophysiological feature of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; and correspondingly reduced systolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and pro-inflammatory/oxidative mediators, including nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), cJNK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (cJNK), endothelin (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, activating protein 1 (AP-1), and 8-isoprostane, whereas the HO inhibitor, stannous mesoporphyrin, nullified the effects. Furthermore, hemin reduced the pro-inflammatory macrophage M1 phenotype, but enhanced the M2 phenotype that dampens inflammation. Because NF-\u03baB activates TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, cJNK, and AP-1 impair insulin signaling, the high levels of these cytokines in obesity/diabetes would create a vicious cycle that, together with 8-isoprostane and ET-1, exacerbates cardiac injury, compromising cardiac function. Therefore, the concomitant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration coupled to increased expressions of IRS-1, PI3K, and PKB may account for enhanced glucose metabolism and amelioration of cardiac injury and function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The hemin-induced preferential polarization of macrophages toward anti-inflammatory macrophage M2 phenotype in cardiac tissue with concomitant suppression of pericardial adiposity in ZDFs are novel findings.

In the cardiac tissue, young obese rats displayed lower lactate and scyllo-inositol levels associated with higher creatine, choline and phosphocholine levels, indicating an early modulation of energy and membrane metabolism.

For miR-206-mediated skeletal muscle-specific silencing of miR-206TS-bearing AAV9 vectors, however, we found this approach failed due to the expression of another member (miR-1) of the same miR family in heart tissue, the intended target. We introduced single-nucleotide substitutions into the miR-206TS and searched for those which prevented miR-1-mediated cardiac repression. Several mutated miR-206TS (m206TS), in particular m206TS-3G, were resistant to miR-1, but remained fully sensitive to miR-206. All these variants had mismatches in the seed region of the miR/m206TS duplex in common. Furthermore, we found that some m206TS, containing mismatches within the seed region or within the 3' portion of the miR-206, even enhanced the miR-206- mediated transgene repression. In vivo expression of m206TS-3G- and miR-122TS-containing transgene of systemically applied AAV9 vectors was strongly repressed in both skeletal muscle and the liver but remained high in the heart.

In this study we tested the role of calreticulin in the adult heart.\nWe generated an inducible transgenic mouse in which calreticulin is targeted to the cardiac tissue using a Cre/loxP system and can be up-regulated in adult hearts. Echocardiography analysis of hearts from transgenic mice expressing calreticulin revealed impaired left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and impaired mitral valve function. There was altered expression of Ca(2+) signaling molecules and the gap junction proteins, Connexin 43 and 45. Sarcoplasmic reticulum associated Ca(2+)-handling proteins (including the cardiac ryanodine receptor, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and cardiac calsequestrin) were down-regulated in the transgenic hearts with increased expression of calreticulin.\nWe show that in adult heart, up-regulated expression of calreticulin induces cardiomyopathy in vivo leading to heart failure. This is due to an alternation in changes in a subset of Ca(2+) handling genes, gap junction components and left ventricle remodeling.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-02-26", "authors": ["DukgyuLee", "TatsujiroOka", "BethHunter", "AlisonRobinson", "SylviaPapp", "KimitoshiNakamura", "WattamonSrisakuldee", "Barbara ENickel", "Peter ELight", "Jason R BDyck", "Gary DLopaschuk", "ElissavetKardami", "MichalOpas", "MarekMichalak"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0056387"}

However, concerns are often raised regarding the effects of X-ray dose accumulated over the course of the experiment.\nTo scan C57BL/6 mice multiple times per week for 6 weeks, in order to determine the effect of the cumulative dose on pulmonary and cardiac tissue at the end of the study.\nC57BL/6 male mice were split into two groups (irradiated group = 10, control group = 10). The irradiated group was scanned (80 kVp/50 mA) three times weekly for 6 weeks, resulting in a weekly dose of 0.84 Gy, and a total study dose of 5.04 Gy. The control group was scanned on the final week. Scans from week 6 were reconstructed and the lungs and heart were analyzed.\nOverall, there was no significant difference in lung volume or lung density or in left ventricular volume or ejection fraction between the control group and the irradiated group. Histological samples taken from excised lung and myocardial tissue also showed no evidence of inflammation or fibrosis in the irradiated group.\nThis study demonstrated that a 5 Gy X-ray dose accumulated over 6 weeks during a longitudinal micro-CT study had no significant effects on the pulmonary and myocardial tissue of C57BL/6 mice.

CML in serum and different tissues was measured to detect possible accumulations. For 88 days, weanling rats were fed with either a control diet or one containing BC, or its soluble low molecular weight (LMW), soluble high molecular weight (HMW) or insoluble fractions. In the last week of the assay, faeces and urine were collected daily and stored as a 1 week pool. After sacrifice, blood was drawn to obtain serum and some organs were removed. CML analysis was performed by HPLC/MS/MS in diets, faeces, urines, serum and tissues. Faecal excretion of CML was strongly influenced by dietary CML levels and represents the major route of excretion (i.e. 33.2%). However, the urinary elimination of CML was probably limited or saturated, especially when more complex compounds were present in the diet. BC consumption increased CML in the cardiac tissue (170 \u00b1 18 vs. 97 \u00b1 3 \u03bcmol per mol lysine for BC and control groups), which correlated with the CML intake. The levels of this AGE in bone were unaffected by the dietary treatment, but in tail tendons CML was greatly increased in the animals that consumed the BC diet (102 \u00b1 13 vs. 51 \u00b1 8 \u03bcmol per mol lysine for BC and control groups, P = 0.006), which was associated with the intake of soluble LMW compounds present in BC.

{"title": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and cardiac fibrosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is associated with most cardiac diseases. Fibrosis is an accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) synthesized by cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the most prevalent cell type in the heart, comprising 75% of cardiac cells. Myofibroblasts are hardly present in healthy normal heart tissue, but appear abundantly in diseased hearts. Cardiac fibroblasts are activated by a variety of pathological stimuli, such as myocardial injury, oxidative stress, mechanical stretch, and elevated autocrine-paracrine mediators, thereby undergoing proliferation, differentiation to myofibroblasts, and production of various cytokines and ECM proteins. A number of signaling pathways and bioactive molecules are involved and work in concert to activate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the fibrogenesis cascade. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are not only principal ECM producers, but also play a central role in fibrogenesis and myocardial remodeling in fibrotic heart disease. Thus, understanding the biological processes of cardiac fibroblasts will provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis and provide potential targets for developing antifibrotic drugs. Recent studies demonstrate that Ca2+ signal is essential for fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, and ECM-protein production. This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling in cardiac fibrogenesis, and potential role of Ca(2+)-permeable channels, in particular, the transient potential (TRP) channels in fibrotic heart disease. TRP channels are highly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. TRPM7 has been shown to be essential in TGF\u03b21 mediated fibrogenesis, and TRPC3 has been demonstrated to play an essential role in regulating fibroblast function. Thus, the Ca2+-permeable TRP channels may serve as potential novel targets for developing anti-fibrotic drugs.", "journal": "Current topics in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2013-02-26", "authors": ["ZhichaoYue", "YanhuiZhang", "JiaXie", "JianminJiang", "LixiaYue"], "doi": "10.2174/1568026611313030005"}
{"title": "A simple model of the right atrium of the human heart with the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes included.", "abstract": "Existing atrial models with detailed anatomical structure and multi-variable cardiac transmembrane current models are too complex to allow to combine an investigation of long time dycal properties of the heart rhythm with the ability to effectively simulate cardiac electrical activity during arrhythmia. Other ways of modeling need to be investigated. Moreover, many state-of-the-art models of the right atrium do not include an atrioventricular node (AVN) and only rarely--the sinoatrial node (SAN). A model of the heart tissue within the right atrium including the SAN and AVN nodes was developed. Looking for a minimal model, currently we are testing our approach on chosen well-known arrhythmias, which were until now obtained only using much more complicated models, or were only observed in a clinical setting. Ultimately, the goal is to obtain a model able to generate sequences of RR intervals specific for the arrhythmias involving the AV junction as well as for other phenomena occurring within the atrium. The model should be fast enough to allow the study of heart rate variability and arrhythmias at a time scale of thousands of heart beats in real-time. In the model of the right atrium proposed here, different kinds of cardiac tissues are described by sets of different equations, with most of them belonging to the class of Li\u00e9nard nonlinear dynamical systems. We have developed a series of models of the right atrium with differing anatomical simplifications, in the form of a 2D mapping of the atrium or of an idealized cylindrical geometry, including only those anatomical details required to reproduce a given physiological phenomenon. The simulations allowed to reconstruct the phase relations between the sinus rhythm and the location and properties of a parasystolic source together with the effect of this source on the resultant heart rhythm. We model the action potential conduction time alternans through the atrioventricular AVN junction observed in cardiac tissue in electrophysiological studies during the ventricular-triggered atrial tachycardia. A simulation of the atrio-ventricular nodal reentry tachycardia was performed together with an entrainment procedure in which the arrhythmia circuit was located by measuring the post-pacing interval (PPI) at simulated mapping catheters. The generation and interpretation of RR times series is the ultimate goal of our research. However, to reach that goal we need first to (1) somehow verify the validity of the model of the atrium with the nodes included and (2) include in the model the effect of the sympathetic and vagal ANS. The current paper serves as a partial solution of the 1). In particular we show, that measuring the PPI-TCL entrainment response in proximal (possibly-the slow-conducting pathway), the distal and at a mid-distance from CS could help in rapid distinction of AVNRT from other atrial tachycardias. Our simulations support the hypothesis that the alternans of the conduction time between the atria and the ventricles in the AV orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia can occur within a single pathway. In the atrial parasystole simulation, we found a mathematical condition which allows for a rough estimation of the location of the parasystolic source within the atrium, both for simplified (planar) and the cylindrical geometry of the atrium. The planar and the cylindrical geometry yielded practically the same results of simulations.", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "date": "2013-02-23", "authors": ["PiotrPodziemski", "Jan JZebrowski"], "doi": "10.1007/s10877-013-9429-6\n10.1161/01.CIR.74.4.722\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.01141.x\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.194357\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00336.x\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1016/j.crvi.2006.12.001\n10.1136/hrt.32.2.172\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.253955\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.06.056\n10.1152/ajpheart.00059.2011\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.053280\n10.1103/PhysRevE.60.2799\n10.1098/rsfs.2010.0048\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.972307\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.4.1647\n10.1006/jtbi.1995.0045"}

CF-derived ECM-coated cell culture dishes were prepared by culturing rat CFs and then decellularizing the cultures. Isolated neonatal rat ventricular cells were seeded on ECM-coated, collagen I-coated or uncoated dishes, and the growth of cells after 1-5 days of culture was assayed with MTT reagent. In addition, cellular metabolic activity was analyzed by spectrophotometric methods and protein levels of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 2a (SERCA2a) by Western blotting. The relative growth of ventricular cells was better on ECM-coated than on uncoated or collagen I-coated dishes. Furthermore, the glucose consumption ratio, lactic acid production ratio, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, SERCA activity and protein levels of SERCA2a were all higher in cells on the ECM-coated dishes. In conclusion, cardiac fi broblast-derived ECM produced in vitro stimulates the growth and metabolism of cultured ventricular cells.

However, molecular mechanisms to support evidence-based SSRI treatment of cardiovascular disease have not been elucidated.

For both the differentiation of stem cells into heart cells and further assembly of these cells into engineered tissues, these two techniques are effective in inducing in vivo like structure and function. Biophysical modulation through the control of topography and manipulation of the electrical microenvironment has been shown to have effects on cell growth and differentiation, expression of mature cardiac-related proteins and genes, cell alignment via cytoskeletal organization, and electrical and contractile properties.

{"title": "Epigenomic model of cardiac enhancers with application to genome wide association studies.", "abstract": "Mammalian gene regulation is often mediated by distal enhancer elements, in particular, for tissue specific and developmental genes. Computational identification of enhancers is difficult because they do not exhibit clear location preference relative to their target gene and also because they lack clearly distinguishing genomic features. This represents a major challenge in deciphering transcriptional regulation. Recent ChIP-seq based genome-wide investigation of epigenomic modifications have revealed that enhancers are often enriched for certain epigenomic marks. Here we utilize the epigenomic data in human heart tissue along with validated human heart enhancers to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model of cardiac enhancers. Cross-validation classification accuracy of our model was 84% and 92% on positive and negative sets respectively with ROC AUC = 0.92. More importantly, while P300 binding has been used as gold standard for enhancers, our model can distinguish P300-bound validated enhancers from other P300-bound regions that failed to exhibit enhancer activity in transgenic mouse. While GWAS studies reveal polymorphic regions associated with certain phenotypes, they do not immediately provide causality. Next, we hypothesized that genomic regions containing a GWAS SNP associated with a cardiac phenotype might contain another SNP in a cardiac enhancer, which presumably mediates the phenotype. Starting with a comprehensive set of SNPs associated with cardiac phenotypes in GWAS studies, we scored other SNPs in LD with the GWAS SNP according to its probability of being an enhancer and choose one with best score in the LD as enhancer. We found that our predicted enhancers are enriched for known cardiac transcriptional regulator motifs and are likely to regulate the nearby gene.

{"title": "A novel self-assembly albumin nanocarrier for reducing doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an antitumor drug commonly used against a wide spectrum of tumors. However, the clinical application of DOX is restricted by its cardiotoxicity. To reduce the cardiotoxicity, we develop an albumin-based nanocarrier via a new molecular switch method for DOX delivery. Spherically shaped DOX-loaded HSA nanoparticles (NPs-DOX) are prepared with a drug-loading capacity and particle size of 4.3% and 120.1 \u00b1 26 nm, respectively. In vivo studies demonstrate that NPs-DOX is able to preferentially accumulate in tumor and show great tumor inhibition on H22 hepatocellular-carcinoma-bearing mice. As for the toxicity, compared with free DOX, the maximum tolerated dose of NPs-DOX is increased from 10 to over 30 mg/kg, indicating the reduced systematic toxicity. More importantly, the cardiotoxicity induced by NPs-DOX is also significantly reduced because both left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening are almost not changed and other cardiotoxicity markers such as serum creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, and malonaldehyde are kept constant. The reduced cardiotoxicity of NPs-DOX is also confirmed by nonhistological changes in the heart tissue.

The present study investigated which diabetes-nitrated protein(s) mediate the development of these pathological changes by identifying the panel of nitrated proteins present in diabetic hearts of wild-type (WT) mice and not in those of cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic (MT-TG) mice. At 2, 4, 8, and 16 wk after streptozotocin induction of diabetes, histopathological examination of the WT and MT-TG diabetic hearts revealed cardiac structure derangement and remodeling, significantly increased superoxide generation, and 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation. A nitrated protein of 58 kDa, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase-1 (SCOT), was identified by mass spectrometry. Although total SCOT expression was not significantly different between the two types of mice, the diabetic WT hearts showed significantly increased nitration content and dramatically decreased catalyzing activity of SCOT. Although SCOT nitration sites were identified at Tyr(76), Tyr(117), Tyr(135), Tyr(226), Tyr(368), and Trp(374), only Tyr(76) and Trp(374) were found to be located in the active site by three-dimensional structure modeling. However, only Trp(374) showed a significantly different nitration level between the WT and MT-TG diabetic hearts. These results suggest that MT prevention of diabetes-induced pathological changes in cardiac tissues is most likely mediated by suppression of SCOT nitration at Trp(374).", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Three different electrical stimulation protocols were tested; the selected protocol consisted of 2\u2009ms monophasic square-wave pulses of 50\u2009mV/cm at 1\u2009Hz over 14\u2009days. Cardiac and subcutaneous ATDPCs were grown on biocompatible patterned surfaces. Cardiomyogenic differentiation was examined by real-time PCR and immunocytofluorescence. In cardiac ATDPCs, MEF2A and GATA-4 were significantly upregulated at day 14 after stimulation, while subcutaneous ATDPCs only exhibited increased Cx43 expression. In response to electrical stimulation, cardiac ATDPCs elongated, and both cardiac and subcutaneous ATDPCs became aligned following the linear surface pattern of the construct. Cardiac ATDPC length increased by 11.3%, while subcutaneous ATDPC length diminished by 11.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.013 and p\u2009=\u20090.030 vs unstimulated controls, respectively).

In this study, we used laser-patterned biochips to define cell-cell contact modes for systematic study of contact-mediated cellular interactions at the single-cell level.

Within this context, we developed a method to estimate in vitro the stress-strain field induced by contraction of cardiovascular progenitor cells on substrates of controlled stiffness.\nTwo alginate-agarose hydrogels were polymerized and mechanically characterized under compression. The hydrogels showed different levels of stiffness, mimicking either normal or pathologic ECM of the cardiac tissue, with an average compressive equilibrium modulus of 3 and 25 kPa, respectively. To estimate substrate deformation induced by the adhering cells, fluorescent microspheres were included under the surface layer of the hydrogels as displacement trackers. The hydrogels were polymerized in multiwell plates and seeded with cells that were allowed to adhere for 24 hours. On the softer substrate, images of the substrate surface and the cells were acquired using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Image processing enabled tracking the microsphere movements and mapping local substrate deformation because of tensile stresses produced by the cells. The resulting tensile stresses could then be calculated from measured stiffness.\nThe substrate strains ranged between a maximum contraction of -26.5% to a maximum stretching of 19.8%. The calculated stresses ranged between a maximum compression of -0.53 kPa to a maximum tension of 0.4 kPa (nN/\u00b5m\u00b2).

In addition, we evaluated collagen I, III, IV (CI, CIII and CIV) deposition in cardiac tissue, and their relationship with serum levels of procollagen type I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP) and procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide (PIIINP). Eight infected and two uninfected guinea pigs were necropsied at seven time points up to one year post-infection. Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis was determined by histopathological observation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, respectively. Deposition of cardiac collagen types was determined by immunohistochemistry and serum levels of PICP, PIIINP, and anti-T. cruzi IgG1 and IgG2 by ELISA. IgG2 (Th1 response) predominated throughout the course of infection; IgG1 (Th2 response) was detected during the chronic phase. Cardiac cell death by necrosis predominated over apoptosis during the acute phase; during the chronic phase, both apoptosis and necrosis were observed in cardiac cells. Apoptosis was also observed in lymphocytes, endothelial cells and epicardial adipose tissue, especially in the chronic phase. Cardiac levels of CI, CIII, CIV increased progressively, but the highest levels were seen in the chronic phase and were primarily due to increase in CIII and CIV.

{"title": "Complement system activation in cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology: friend or foe?", "abstract": "A major goal in current cardiology practice is to determine optimal strategies for minimizing myocardial necrosis and optimizing cardiac repair following an acute myocardial infarction. Temporally regulated activation and suppression of innate immunity may be critical for achieving this goal. Extensive experimental data in various animal models have indicated that inhibiting complement activation offers protection to cardiac tissue after ischemia/reperfusion. However, the results of clinical studies using complement inhibitors (mainly at the C5 level) in patients with acute myocardial infarction have largely been disappointing. In cases in which complement activation participates in the initial events of muscle cell destruction, as in autoimmune myocarditis or autoimmune muscle disorders, inhibition of complement activation is expected to prove a successful treatment. In other pathologic conditions in which complement is recruited by degenerating or dying muscle cells, as in ischemia, the ideal approach is probably to modulate rather than abruptly blunt complement activation. Beneficial effects of complement action with regard to waste disposal, recruitment of stem cells, regeneration, angiogenesis, and better utilization of energy sources under hypoxic conditions may also prove important for successful disease treatment. Patient outcome after myocardial infarction almost certainly depend upon the combined activation of several distinct but potentially interrelated signaling pathways, suggesting that a combination of treatments targeted to different pathways should be the therapy of choice, and modulation of complement could be one of them.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2013-02-14", "authors": ["MsaroSyriga", "ManolisMavroidis"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-4118-2_14"}

Heart failure that is caused by adriamycin-treatment induced cardiac fibrosis is a major cause of death in patients who are treated with this medication. The severe oxidative stress that is induced by adriamycin is considered to be one of the primary mechanisms by which fibrogenesis of cardiac tissue occurs. In the present study, we demonstrate that 3,3'-diindolymethane (DIM) exhibits a significant anti-fibrosis effect on cardiac tissue in an animal model of adriamycin-induced cardiac fibrosis (AICF). Further studies demonstrated that DIM is able to dramatically up-regulate the expression of breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) in cardiac tissue and fibroblast, which subsequently activate the transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). The upregulation of this transcription factor resulted in the expression of several anti-oxidant genes in the cell. Because DIM is a safe food additive that has been used for decades, our findings suggest that there is a great potential for this chemical to be developed into a clinical medication for the treatment of adriamycin-induced heart failure during cancer therapy.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2013-02-05", "authors": ["ZhengweiYao", "WeiHu", "ShanYin", "ZhenHuang", "QianZhu", "JiangningChen", "YuhuiZang", "LeiDong", "JunfengZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2013.01.006"}
{"title": "The pathogenesis of neonatal autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases: a comprehensive review.", "abstract": "Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are two distinct disease entities that can present in the neonate. Autoimmune diseases of the newborn primarily include neonatal lupus and neonatal anti-phospholipid syndrome, but other diseases have been reported as well. The pathogenic mechanisms behind autoimmune diseases of the newborns are unknown, but an association with antibodies to Ro and La is present in most cases. The extent to which these antibodies play a pathogenic role is unknown. Because the phenotype of clinical neonatal lupus is variable in many mothers who possess the antibodies, other mechanisms may be necessary to confer disease. The primary theories include apoptosis of cardiac cells, maternal microchimerism, cross-reactivity of the autoantibodies with cardiac tissue, T cell dysregulation and inhibitory receptors, and a genetic predisposition. The autoinflammatory diseases are unrelated to neonatal autoimmune diseases and include the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). These diseases include familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). All of these diseases share a defect in a common gene--the CIAS1 or NALP3 gene on chromosome 1. The diseases vary in severity and involvement of different physiologic systems, with FCAS being the mildest form and NOMID being the most severe form with involvement of the neurologic and hematologic systems. Aberrant functioning of the inflammasome may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases.", "journal": "Journal of autoimmunity", "date": "2013-02-05", "authors": ["ChristopherChang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jaut.2012.12.010"}

A total of 420 1-d-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned to two dietary treatments with fifteen replicates of fourteen broilers each. Treatment diets consisted of L-carnitine supplementation at levels of 0 and 100 mg/kg. At 11-d of age, low temperature stress was used to increase ascites susceptibility. Blood, heart and liver samples were collected at different ages for analysis of boichemical parameters. The results showed that, there was no significant difference in growth performance with L-carnitine supplementation, but the mortality due to ascites was significantly decreased. Dietary L-carnitine supplementation significantly reduced heart index (HI) and ascites heart index (AHI) on d 21, lung index (LUI) on d 35 and liver index (LI) on d 42. The broilers fed diets containing L-carnitine had significantly lower red blood cell counts (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB) concentration and hematocrit (HCT) on d 42. Dietary L-carnitine supplementation significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content of heart tissue on d 21 and 35, and significantly increased total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of the heart on d 21 and 42. L-carnitine supplementation significantly reduced serum triglyceride (TG) content on d 28 and 35 and serum glucose (GLU) on d 35 and 42, and significantly increased serum total protein (TP) and globulin (GLO) content on d 42. L-carnitine supplementation significantly enhanced liver succinodehydrogenase (SDH), malic dehydrogenase (MDH) and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity on d 28, and tended to reduce the lactic acid (LD) level of liver on d 35 (p = 0.06). L-carnitine supplementation significantly reduced serum uric acid (UA) content on d 28, 35 and 42. Based on the current results, it can be concluded that dietary L-carnitine supplementation reduced organ index, red blood cell counts and hematocrit, enhanced antioxidative capacity of the heart, enhanced liver enzymes activity involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle, and reduced serum glucose and triglyceride. Therefore, it is suggested that L-carnitine can potentially reduce susceptibility and mortality due to ascites.", "journal": "Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences", "date": "2013-02-01", "authors": ["Y WWang", "DNing", "Y ZPeng", "Y MGuo"], "doi": "10.5713/ajas.2012.12407"}

Neointimal hyperplasia is a main step in the pathogenesis of late-term restenosis, which is developed after vascular interventions. Reduction in nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of neointima formation. Phosphodiesterase V is detected in the peripheral coronary and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and in the cardiac tissue. Based on the effects of phosphodiesterase V inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle cells, in the present study, the effect of tadalafil, a new member of phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, on neointimal hyperplasia was investigated in the rabbit carotid artery anastomosis model.\nFourteen male New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.5-3 kg, were used. The rabbits were randomly divided into two equal groups; tadalafil group received oral tadalafil (2 mg/kg/day), and PBS group received sterile PBS solution (normal saline; 2 mg/kg/day) for 28 days after the surgery. The right carotid arteries of all rabbits were anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion using 8/0 polypropylene suture. The rabbits were sacrificed at the end of the postoperative period of 28 days. After sacrificing, firstly anastomosis segment on the right carotid artery and secondly a part of the left carotid artery (as control) of each rabbit were removed. Morphometric examination of tissue sections was performed under a light microscope connected to an image capture system.\nThere was a significant difference between the right and left carotid arteries in terms of intimal area and intima/media ratio both in tadalafil and PBS groups (p <0.001 for each). Intimal area and intima/media ratio were increased in the right carotid arteries compared to the left carotid arteries (p <0.001 for each). Besides, when the right carotid arteries of both groups were compared using covariance analysis, it was observed that intimal area and intima/media ratio in the anastomosis site were significantly reduced with tadalafil treatment (p <0.001).\nThe present study was promising in terms of tadalafil use as a new agent for the prevention of neointimal hyperplasia, which is the leading cause of late-term graft failure in vascular surgery.", "journal": "Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia", "date": "2013-02-01", "authors": ["MehmetGuzeloglu", "KorayAykut", "G\u00f6khanAlbayrak", "SonerAtmaca", "SuleymanOktar", "AlperBagriyanik", "EyupHazan"], "doi": "10.5761/atcs.oa.12.02017"}

Specifically, myocardial tissues cultured on 50 \u03bcm thick CNT-GelMA showed 3 times higher spontaneous synchronous beating rates and 85% lower excitation threshold, compared to those cultured on pristine GelMA hydrogels. Our results indicate that the electrically conductive and nanofibrous networks formed by CNTs within a porous gelatin framework are the key characteristics of CNT-GelMA leading to improved cardiac cell adhesion, organization, and cell-cell coupling. Centimeter-scale patches were released from glass substrates to form 3D biohybrid actuators, which showed controllable linear cyclic contraction/extension, pumping, and swimming actuations. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that cardiac tissues cultured on CNT-GelMA resist damage by a model cardiac inhibitor as well as a cytotoxic compound. Therefore, incorporation of CNTs into gelatin, and potentially other biomaterials, could be useful in creating multifunctional cardiac scaffolds for both therapeutic purposes and in vitro studies.

Genetic disruption of TWIST1 resulted in a cachectic phenotype and early death of the knock-out mice. This might be connected to the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS), as miR-199a has been suggested to regulate the ubiquitin E2 ligases Ube2i and Ube2g1.\nCardiac tissue from explanted hearts of 42 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 20 healthy donor hearts were analysed for protein expression of TWIST1 and its inhibitors Id-1, MuRF-1 and MAFbx, the expression of miR-199a, -199b and -214, as well as the activity of the UPS by using specific fluorogenic substrates.\nTWIST1 was repressed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by 43% (p=0.003), while Id1 expression was unchanged.

An increased peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolysing activity (p<0.0001) was observed in the UPS, while the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were unchanged. The protein levels of the rate limiting ubiquitin E3-ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx were up-regulated (p=0.005 and p=0.0156, respectively). Mechanistically silencing of TWIST1 using siRNA in primary rat cardiomyocytes led to a down-regulation of the miR-199/214 cluster and to a subsequent up-regulation of Ube2i.\nThe TWIST1/miR-199/214 axis is down-regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy, which is likely to play a role in the increased activity of the UPS.

In this study oral administration of the chitosan-PAP gene to shrimp was investigated for its ability to induce immunity. The PAP gene was cooperated into a phMGFP plasmid, named PAP-phMGFP. Chitosan-PAP-phMGFP nanoparticles were formed by mixing a low molecular weight chitosan (50\u00a0kDa) and a high molecular weight chitosan (150\u00a0kDa) with various ratios of PAP-phMGFP. The optimal ratio of chitosan PAP-phMGFP nanoparticles was first determined by transfection into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells before being used for oral immunization in shrimp. The chitosan-PAP-phMGFP nanoparticles at a ratio of 2:1 with the low molecular weight chitosan were optimum for transfecting the CHO cells. The shrimp were then fed with 25, 50, 100 and 150\u00a0\u03bcg/shrimp/day of chitosan-PAP-phMGFP (2:1) nanoparticles then challenged by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Shrimp fed with 50\u00a0\u03bcg of chitosan-PAP-phMGFP nanoparticles per day for 7 consecutive days, produced the highest relative percent survival (RPS) (94.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.86%). The presence of PAP-phMGFP was detected in every shrimp tissue including the hemolymph, lymphoid organ, heart, hepatopancreas, intestine and muscle. The folds increase of the PAP gene expression increased significantly together with an increase of the phagocytic activity in the immunized shrimp. The stability of the PAP-phMGFP in the immunized shrimp hemolymph was detected by determination of the expression of the GFP at various days after immunization ceased. GFP expression was detected until the 15th day but not at the 30th day after immunization ceased. A quantitative analysis of the WSSV copies in shrimp heart tissue was significantly reduced in the immunized shrimp. In addition, chitosan-PAP-phMGFP nanoparticles protected shrimp against WSSV, Yellow head virus (YHV) and Vibrio harveyi with RPS values of 83.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.86%, 55.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.72% and 53.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.52%, respectively.

Here, we introduce a methodology for quantitative tissue characterization based on fluorescent labeling, 3-D scanning confocal microscopy, image processing and reconstruction of tissue micro-structure at sub-micrometer resolution. We applied this methodology to normal rabbit ventricular tissue and tissue from hearts with myocardial infarction. Our analysis revealed that the volume fraction of fibroblasts increased from 4.83\u00b10.42% (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) in normal tissue up to 6.51\u00b10.38% in myocardium from infarcted hearts.

The mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure remain unclear but are thought to involve p53-mediated myocardial cell apoptosis. The tripartite G-protein inactivating protein RGS6 has been implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, ATM/p53 activation, and apoptosis in doxorubicin-treated cells. Thus, we hypothesized that RGS6, the expression of which is enriched in cardiac tissue, might also be responsible for the pathologic effects of doxorubicin treatment in heart. In this study, we show that RGS6 expression is induced strongly by doxorubicin in the ventricles of mice and isolated ventricular myocytes via a posttranscriptional mechanism. While doxorubicin-treated wild-type (WT) mice manifested severe left ventricular dysfunction, loss of heart and body mass, along with decreased survival 5 days after doxorubicin administration, mice lacking RGS6 were completely protected against these pathogenic responses. Activation of ATM/p53 apoptosis signaling by doxorubicin in ventricles of WT mice was also absent in their RGS6(-/-) counterparts. Doxorubicin-induced ROS generation was dramatically impaired in both the ventricles and ventricular myocytes isolated from RGS6(-/-) mice, and the apoptotic response to doxorubicin in ventricular myocytes required RGS6-dependent ROS production. These results identify RGS6 as an essential mediator of the pathogenic responses to doxorubicin in heart, and they argue that RGS6 inhibition offers a rational means to circumvent doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in human patients with cancer.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2013-01-23", "authors": ["JianqiYang", "BiswanathMaity", "JieHuang", "ZhanGao", "AdeleStewart", "Robert MWeiss", "Mark EAnderson", "Rory AFisher"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3453"}

Several age-related cellular processes were evaluated, including telomere shortening, changes in p53 and p16 expression, changes in mitochondria DNA expression and DNA deletion, and alteration of mitochondria. We found that the aging of the B6 mice cardiac tissue is associated with the maintenance of telomere length, increased expression of p53 and p16, mild changes in mitochondrial DNA expression but widespread DNA deletion, and significant alterations of the mitochondrial ultrastructure within the cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Ephaptic coupling in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "While it is widely believed that conduction in cardiac tissue is regulated by gap junctions, recent experimental evidence suggests that the extracellular space may play a significant role in action potential propagation. Cardiac tissue with low gap junctional coupling still exhibits conduction, with conflicting degrees of slowing that may be due to variations in the extracellular space. Inhomogeneities in the extracellular space caused by the complex cellular structure in cardiac tissue can lead to ephaptic, or field effect, coupling. Here, we present data from simulations of a cylindrical strand of cells in which we see the dramatic effect highly resistant extracellular spaces have on propagation velocity. We find that ephaptic effects occur in all areas of small extracellular spaces and are not restricted to the junctional cleft between cells. This previously unrecognized type of field coupling, which we call lateral coupling, can allow conduction in the absence of gap junctions. We compare our results with the classically used cable theory, demonstrating the quantitative difference in propagation velocity arising from the cellular geometry. Ephaptic effects are shown to be highly dependent upon parameter values, frequently enhancing, but sometimes decreasing propagation speed.

Role of autophagy and the diagnostic potential of microRNAs that regulate the autophagy in cardiac hypertrophy have not been evaluated. A rat model of cardiac hypertrophy was established using transverse abdominal aortic constriction (operation group). Cardiomyocyte autophagy was enhanced in rats from the operation group, compared with those in the sham operation group. Moreover, the operation group showed up-regulation of beclin-1 (an autophagy-related gene), and down-regulation of miR-30 in cardiac tissue. The effects of inhibition and over-expression of the beclin-1 gene on the expression of hypertrophy-related genes and on autophagy were assessed. Angiotensin II-induced myocardial hypertrophy was found to be mediated by over-expression of the beclin-1 gene. A dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that beclin-1 was a target gene of miR-30a. miR-30a induced alterations in beclin-1 gene expression and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with miR-30a mimic attenuated the Angiotensin II-induced up-regulation of hypertrophy-related genes and decreased in the cardiomyocyte surface area. Conversely, treatment with miR-30a inhibitor enhanced the up-regulation of hypertrophy-related genes and increased the surface area of cardiomyocytes induced by Angiotensin II. In addition, circulating miR-30 was elevated in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and circulating miR-30 was positively associated with left ventricular wall thickness. Collectively, these above-mentioned results suggest that Angiotensin II induces down-regulation of miR-30 in cardiomyocytes, which in turn promotes myocardial hypertrophy through excessive autophagy.

Beta-guanidinopropionic acid decreased intracellular creatine and phosphocreatine in all tissues studied. In skeletal muscle, this effect induced a shift from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism, increased cellular glucose uptake and increased fatigue tolerance. In heart tissue this shift to mitochondrial metabolism was less pronounced. Myocardial contractility was modestly reduced, including a decreased ventricular developed pressure, albeit with unchanged cardiac output. In brain tissue adaptations in energy metabolism resulted in enhanced ATP stability and survival during hypoxia.\nChronic beta-guanidinopropionic acid increases fatigue tolerance of skeletal muscle and survival during ischaemia in animal studies, with modestly reduced myocardial contractility.

Stem cells from various sources and origin are being currently used for regeneration studies directly or along with differentiation inducing agents. Long term survival and minimal side effects can be attained by using autologous cells and reduced use of inducing agents. Cardiomyogenic differentiation of adult derived stem cells has been previously reported using various inducing agents but the use of a potentially harmful DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has been found to be critical in almost all studies. Alternate inducing factors and conditions/stimulant like physical condition including electrical stimulation, chemical inducers and biological agents have been attempted by numerous groups to induce cardiac differentiation. Biomaterials were initially used as artificial scaffold in in vitro studies and later as a delivery vehicle. Natural ECM is the ideal biological scaffold since it contains all the components of the tissue from which it was derived except for the living cells. Constructive remodeling can be performed using such natural ECM scaffolds and stem cells since, the cells can be delivered to the site of infraction and once delivered the cells adhere and are not \"lost\". Due to the niche like conditions of ECM, stem cells tend to differentiate into tissue specific cells and attain several characteristics similar to that of functional cells even in absence of any directed differentiation using external inducers. The development of niche mimicking biomaterials and hybrid biomaterial can further advance directed differentiation without specific induction.

Fibrin is an ideal biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering as it is a natural, biodegradable polymer that can induce neovascularization, promote cell attachment, and has tunable mechanical properties. Here we describe a novel, high-density microtemplated fibrin scaffold seeded with a tri-cell mixture of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts to mimic native cardiac tissue in structure and cellular composition to improve cell retention and promote integration with the host tissue. Scaffolds were designed with uniform architecture of parallel 60 \u03bcm microchannels surrounded by an interconnected microporous network of 27-\u03bcm-diameter pores and mechanical stiffness comparable to native cardiac tissues (70-90kPa). Scaffold degradation was controlled with the addition of Factor XIII (FXIII) and/or protease inhibitor (aprotinin). Unmodified scaffolds had a fast degradation profile both in vitro (19.9%\u00b13.9% stiffness retention after 10 days) and in vivo. Scaffolds treated with FXIII showed an intermediate degradation profile in vitro (45.8%\u00b15.9%), while scaffolds treated with aprotinin or both FXIII and aprotinin showed significantly slowed degradation in vitro (60.9%\u00b15.2% and 76.4%\u00b17.6%, respectively, p<0.05).

{"title": "Caspase-3 as a therapeutic target for heart failure.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a condition with significant morbidity and high mortality. It is likely to become unmanageable in the rapidly increasing aging population, due mainly to lack of effective treatment. Apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms causing cardiomyocyte loss in the failing hearts of both human patients and animal models. Thus, anti-apoptosis has been proposed as a provocative new concept for preventive and therapeutic strategies for heart failure.\nThis review summarizes evidence that apoptotic cells in heart are not completely committed to death. They are likely to be targeted for reversing the cardiac dysfunction. Drugs that inhibit the progression of apoptosis help restore systolic function, reverse remodeling or even prevent heart failure. Inhibitors of caspase-3, the major executors of apoptosis, have been shown to hold great promises for apoptosis interruption in heart tissues.\nAlthough the underlying cause and the pathophysiological role of apoptosis remain elusive, antiapoptotic therapy has emerged as an enigma for heart failure. Caspases promote the progressive loss of contractile function in heart failure by facilitating the degradation of myofibrillar proteins. Selective inhibition of the proteolytic functions of caspase-3 may represent an attractive approach to attenuate or reverse heart failure.", "journal": "Expert opinion on therapeutic targets", "date": "2013-01-09", "authors": ["BoYang", "DeweiYe", "YuWang"], "doi": "10.1517/14728222.2013.745513"}

Hypercholesterolemic diet has also been reported to cause changes in the antioxidant system. In our study, different doses of Juniperus communis Linn (JCL) oil, a tree species growing in Mediterranean and Isparta regions and having aromatic characteristics, were administered to rats; and the levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay (TBARS) were examined in the heart tissue of rats. In this study, 35 Wistar Albino male adult rats weighing approximately 250-300\u00a0g were used. The rats were divided into five groups of seven each. The control group was administered normal pellet chow, and the Chol group was administered pellet chow including 2% Chol, while 50 JCL, 100 JCL, and 200 JCL groups were administered 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil dissolved in 0.5% sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, respectively, in addition to the pellet chow containing 2% Chol, by gavage.

While consumption of dietary Chol decreases the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in heart tissue of rats (not significant), administeration of 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil in addition to Chol led to a significant increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Administering Chol led to a significant increase in TBARS level. Administering 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil together with Chol prevented significantly the increase in lipid peroxides.

Adenosine and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors are co-expressed in numerous tissues and mediate important cellular responses to the autocoid adenosine and sympathetic stimulation, respectively. The present study was undertaken to examine whether adenosine A1ARs heterodimerize with \u03b21- and/or \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (\u03b21R and \u03b22R), and whether such interactions lead to functional consequences. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies with differentially epitope-tagged A1, \u03b21, and \u03b22 receptors transiently co-expressed in HEK-293 cells indicate that A1AR forms constitutive heterodimers with both \u03b21R and \u03b22R. This heterodimerization significantly influenced orthosteric ligand binding affinity of both \u03b21R and \u03b22R without altering ligand binding properties of A1AR. Receptor-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation significantly increased in cells expressing A1AR/\u03b21R and A1AR/\u03b22R heteromers. \u03b2-Receptor-mediated cAMP production was not altered in A1AR/\u03b21R expressing cells, but was significantly reduced in the A1AR/\u03b22R cells. The inhibitory effect of the A1AR on cAMP production was abrogated in both A1AR/\u03b21R and A1AR/\u03b22R expressing cells in response to the A1AR agonist CCPA. Co-immunoprecipitation studies conducted with human heart tissue lysates indicate that endogenous A1AR, \u03b21R, and \u03b22R also form heterodimers. Taken together, our data suggest that heterodimerization between A1 and \u03b2 receptors leads to altered receptor pharmacology, functional coupling, and intracellular signaling pathways.

{"title": "Blood Group A antigen expression on cardiac endothelium is highly individualized: possible implications for transplantation.", "abstract": "Outcomes in cases of adult accidental ABO incompatible cardiac transplantation are highly variable, with some patients suffering nearly immediate catastrophic antibody-mediated rejection while others (~37%-45%) survive. We hypothesize that these disparate outcomes could be influenced by variations in blood group antigen expression on allograft endothelium.\nImmunohistochemical stains for blood Group A antigen were performed on cardiac tissue from 18 blood Type A cadavers. Staining was evaluated by two distinct modalities: semiquantitative light microscopy, which measured the intensity of antigen expression on endothelium, and quantitative digital analysis, which determined the percentage of the total tissue section area staining positive for blood Group A antigen. These data were used to compute a Comprehensive Expression Index (CEI) of blood Group A antigen expression for each specimen.\nSemiquantitative light microscopic examination determined that endothelium was stained with low intensity in four (22%) myocardial samples, intermediate intensity in five (28%) samples, and high intensity in nine (50%) samples. Quantitative digital analysis revealed a range in the percentage of total cross sectional area composed of blood Group A-positive signal (median, 2.69%; interquartile range, 1.68%-2.94%). Increased percentage of total cross sectional area composed of blood Group A-positive signal was positively associated with patient age (P=.0037). The CEI showed a broad range, with a median of 5.27 and an interquartile range of 2.92-8.22.\nThere are little data available regarding interindividual differences in blood Group A antigen expression in cardiac endothelium.

{"title": "Bioactive lipids and cationic antimicrobial peptides as new potential regulators for trafficking of bone marrow-derived stem cells in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) triggers mobilization of stem cells from bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB). Based on our observation that the bioactive sphingophospholipids, sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), and ceramide-1 phosphate (C1P) regulate trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we explored whether they also direct trafficking of non-hematopoietic stem cells (non-HSCs). We detected a 3-6-fold increase in circulating CD34+, CD133+, and CXCR4+ lineage-negative (Lin-)/CD45- cells that are enriched in non-HSCs [including endothelial progenitors (EPCs) and very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs)] in PB from AMI patients (P<0.05 vs. controls). Concurrently, we measured a \u223c3-fold increase in S1P and C1P levels in plasma from AMI patients. At the same time, plasma obtained at hospital admission and 6\u2009h after AMI strongly chemoattracted human BM-derived CD34+/Lin- and CXCR4+/Lin- cells in Transwell chemotaxis assays. This effect of plasma was blunted after depletion of S1P level by charcoal stripping and was further inhibited by the specific S1P1 receptor antagonist such as W146 and VPC23019. We also noted that the expression of S1P receptor 1 (S1P1), which is dominant in na\u00efve BM, is reduced after the exposure to S1P at concentrations similar to the plasma S1P levels in patients with AMI, thus influencing the role of S1P in homing to the injured myocardium. Therefore, we examined mechanisms, other than bioactive lipids, that may contribute to the homing of BM non-HSCs to the infarcted myocardium. Hypoxic cardiac tissue increases the expression of cathelicidin and \u03b2-2 defensin, which could explain why PB cells isolated from patients with AMI migrated more efficiently to a low, yet physiological, gradient of stromal-derived factor-1 in Transwell migration assays. Together, these observations suggest that while elevated S1P and C1P levels early in the course of AMI may trigger mobilization of non-HSCs into PB, cathelicidin and \u03b2-2 defensin could play an important role in their homing to damaged myocardium.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2013-01-04", "authors": ["Anush VKarapetyan", "Yuri MKlyachkin", "SamySelim", "ManjulaSunkara", "Khaled MZiada", "Donald ACohen", "Ewa KZuba-Surma", "JaninaRatajczak", "Susan SSmyth", "Mariusz ZRatajczak", "Andrew JMorris", "AhmedAbdel-Latif"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2012.0488\n10.1002/stem.1291"}

The differentiative potential of embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from different tissues (such as bone marrow and adipose tissue) was extensively explored in cell therapy for regenerative medicine.

{"title": "Ablation of cardiac myosin-binding protein-C accelerates contractile kinetics in engineered cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a heterogenous disease in which the phenotypic presentation is influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Though mouse models have been used extensively to study the contractile effects of cMyBP-C ablation, early postnatal hypertrophic and dilatory remodeling may overshadow primary contractile defects. The use of a murine engineered cardiac tissue (mECT) model of cMyBP-C ablation in the present study permits delineation of the primary contractile kinetic abnormalities in an intact tissue model under mechanical loading conditions in the absence of confounding remodeling events. We generated mechanically integrated mECT using isolated postnatal day 1 mouse cardiac cells from both wild-type (WT) and cMyBP-C-null hearts. After culturing for 1 wk to establish coordinated spontaneous contraction, we measured twitch force and Ca(2+) transients at 37\u00b0C during pacing at 6 and 9 Hz, with and without dobutamine. Compared with WT, the cMyBP-C-null mECT demonstrated faster late contraction kinetics and significantly faster early relaxation kinetics with no difference in Ca(2+) transient kinetics. Strikingly, the ability of cMyBP-C-null mECT to increase contractile kinetics in response to adrenergic stimulation and increased pacing frequency were severely impaired. We conclude that cMyBP-C ablation results in constitutively accelerated contractile kinetics with preserved peak force with minimal contractile kinetic reserve. These functional abnormalities precede the development of the hypertrophic phenotype and do not result from alterations in Ca(2+) transient kinetics, suggesting that alterations in contractile velocity may serve as the primary functional trigger for the development of hypertrophy in this model of HCM. Our findings strongly support a mechanism in which cMyBP-C functions as a physiological brake on contraction by positioning myosin heads away from the thin filament, a constraint which is removed upon adrenergic stimulation or cMyBP-C ablation.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2013-01-02", "authors": ["Willem Jde Lange", "Adrian CGrimes", "Laura FHegge", "J CarterRalphe"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.201210837\n10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00081-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.014\n10.1161/01.RES.65.2.334\n10.1152/ajpheart.01037.2006\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.009\n10.1093/cvr/cvp247\n10.1021/bi9710129\n10.1085/jgp.201010448\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.089219\n10.1016/j.jmb.2006.12.063\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178996\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.183897\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.012\n10.1021/bi300085x\n10.1152/physrev.00039.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242354\n10.1152/ajpheart.00308.2003\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00694-6\n10.1006/jmbi.1998.2522\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)00727-9\n10.1161/01.RES.0000012222.70819.64\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231670\n10.1152/ajpheart.00417.2010\n10.1016/j.jsb.2010.12.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000096363.85588.9A\n10.1007/s10974-006-9090-5\n10.1161/01.RES.76.1.40\n10.3109/15376516.2012.666650\n10.1172/JCI7377\n10.1085/jgp.201010471\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.706523\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.645499\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.158774\n10.1074/jbc.M606949200\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00076-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242560\n10.1074/jbc.M808850200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000219863.94390.ce\n10.1529/biophysj.105.078147\n10.1161/01.RES.0000245191.34690.66\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153650\n10.1152/ajpheart.00205.2006\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.062539\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.177683\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.838672\n10.1073/pnas.93.17.8999\n10.1161/01.RES.55.5.565\n10.1161/01.RES.0000021115.24712.99"}

Its effects on cardiac kinetics are modified by phosphorylation. Three phosphorylation sites (Ser275, Ser284, and Ser304) have been identified in vivo, all located in the cardiac-specific M-domain of cMyBP-C. However, recent work has shown that up to 4 phosphate groups are present in human cMyBP-C.\nTo identify and characterize additional phosphorylation sites in human cMyBP-C.\nCardiac MyBP-C was semipurified from human heart tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified a novel phosphorylation site on serine 133 in the proline-alanine-rich linker sequence between the C0 and C1 domains of cMyBP-C. Unlike the known sites, Ser133 was not a target of protein kinase A. In silico kinase prediction revealed glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) as the most likely kinase to phosphorylate Ser133. In vitro incubation of the C0C2 fragment of cMyBP-C with GSK3\u03b2 showed phosphorylation on Ser133. In addition, GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylated Ser304, although the degree of phosphorylation was less compared with protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation at Ser304. GSK3\u03b2 treatment of single membrane-permeabilized human cardiomyocytes significantly enhanced the maximal rate of tension redevelopment.\nGSK3\u03b2 phosphorylates cMyBP-C on a novel site, which is positioned in the proline-alanine-rich region and increases kinetics of force development, suggesting a noncanonical role for GSK3\u03b2 at the sarcomere level.

Lower glycemia diets are usually rich in fruits, non-starchy vegetables and whole grain products. The goal of our study was to compare and contrast the effects of a low vs. high glycemic diet using the biochemical composition and microstructure of the heart. The improved spatial resolution and signal-to-noise for SR-FTIR obtained through the coupling of the bright synchrotron infrared photon source to an infrared spectral microscope enabled the molecular-level observation of diet-related changes within unfixed fresh frozen histologic sections of mouse cardiac tissue. High and low glycemic index (GI) diets were started at the age of five-months and continued for one year, with the diets only differing in their starch distribution (high GI diet = 100% amylopectin versus low GI diet = 30% amylopectin/70% amylose). Serial cryosections of cardiac tissue for SR-FTIR imaging alternated with adjacent hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections allowed not only fine-scale chemical analyses of glycogen and glycolipid accumulation along a vein as well as protein glycation hotspots co-localizing with collagen cold spots but also the tracking of morphological differences occurring in tandem with these chemical changes. As a result of the bright synchrotron infrared photon source coupling, we were able to provide significant molecular evidence for a positive correlation between protein glycation and collagen degradation in our mouse model.

They contain a heterogeneous cell population that includes cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and cardiac fibroblasts. CS and CPCs have been shown to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in experimental models and are now being studied in clinical trials. The effects of aging on the proliferative capacity of CS and CPCs, and the paracrine signaling between cell types, remain incompletely understood.\nWe compared the growth of CS from young and aging murine hearts at baseline and following MI. The number of CS from young and aging hearts was similar at baseline. However, after MI, young hearts had a dramatic increase in the number of CS that grew, but this proliferative response to MI was virtually abolished in the aging heart. Further, the proportion of cells within the CS that were CPCs (defined as Sca-1(stem cell antigen-1)(+)/CD45(-)) was significantly lower in aging hearts than young hearts. Thus the number of available CPCs after culture from aging hearts was substantially lower than from young hearts. Cardiac fibroblasts from aging hearts proliferated more slowly in culture than those from young hearts. We then investigated the interaction between aging cardiac fibroblasts and CPCs. We found no significant paracrine effects on proliferation between these cell types, suggesting the impaired proliferation is a cell-autonomous problem.\nAging hearts generate fewer CPCs, and aging CPCs have significantly reduced proliferative potential following MI.

Surprisingly, characterization of the ECM with cardiac development is scattered and fails to comprehensively reflect the spatiotemporal dynamics making it difficult to apply to tissue engineering efforts. The objective of this work was to define a blueprint of the spatiotemporal organization, localization, and relative amount of the four essential ECM proteins, collagen types I and IV (COLI, COLIV), elastin (ELN), and fibronectin (FN) in the left ventricle of the murine heart at embryonic stages E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 and 2 days postnatal (P2). Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging identified fibrillar collagens at E14.5, with an increasing density over time. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to compare the spatial distribution, organization, and relative amounts of each ECM protein. COLIV was found throughout the developing heart, progressing in amount and organization from E12.5 to P2. The amount of COLI was greatest at E12.5 particularly within the epicardium. For all stages, FN was present in the epicardium, with highest levels at E12.5 and present in the myocardium and the endocardium at relatively constant levels at all time points. ELN remained relatively constant in appearance and amount throughout the developmental stages except for a transient increase at E16.5. Expression of ECM mRNA was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and allowed for comparison of amounts of ECM molecules at each time point. Generally, COLI and COLIII mRNA expression levels were comparatively high, while COLIV, laminin, and FN were expressed at intermediate levels throughout the time period studied. Interestingly, levels of ELN mRNA were relatively low at early time points (E12.5), but increased significantly by P2. Thus, we identified changes in the spatial and temporal localization of the primary ECM of the developing ventricle. This characterization can serve as a blueprint for fabrication techniques, which we illustrate by using multiphoton excitation photochemistry to create a synthetic scaffold based on COLIV organization at P2.

A heartbeat signal, originated from CCS, spreads through its branches to the different parts of the heart, initiating depolarization of the ventricles. However, this highly important system could not be distinguished visually from the surrounding heart tissues: myocardium (MC) and connective tissue (CT). Thus, during surgical procedures, CCS could be easily damaged; namely, the reliable method for identification of CCS either in vivo or ex vivo does not exist. Accordingly, there is a definite need for developing a CCS imaging method. Reflection confocal microscopy (RCM) offers non-destructive imaging of the tissue at depths of up to 0.35 mm with the capability of identification of a single cell. During the visualization procedure, a given tissue is illuminated with infrared laser light and the image is obtained because of different reflections from the tissue structures. However, the reflective structures in the heart tissues are still not identified. In the present study, for the first time we investigated cardiac tissues by RCM. The resolution of the method allowed us to distinguish MC cells and CCS cells. The method also allowed us to distinguish the network-like structures that are main components of CT.

Our aim was to describe the expression of LXRs in the murine heart, and to determine effects of cardiac LXR activation on target gene expression, lipid homeostasis and ischemia. Both LXR\u03b1 and -\u03b2 were expressed in heart tissues, HL-1 cells and isolated cardiomyocytes as determined by qRT-PCR. Elevated cardiac expression of LXR target genes and LXR\u03b2 was observed 24\u00a0h after in vivo permanent coronary artery ligation. The synthetic LXR agonist GW3965 induced mRNA expression of the LXR target genes in HL-1 cells and isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with a buildup of intracellular triglycerides and expanding lipid droplets as quantified by confocal microscopy. Mice injected with GW3965 had cardiac LXR activation as judged by increased target gene expression and lipid droplet accumulation. GW3965 in vivo and in vitro increased expression of genes inducing triglyceride synthesis, and altered expression of lipid droplet-binding protein genes. GW3965 protected HL-1 cells against hypoxia-reoxygenation induced apoptosis. LXR activation by GW3965 in vivo prior to heart isolation and perfusion with induced global ischemia and reperfusion improved left ventricular contractile function and decreased infarct size.

In the first family, two brothers presented with vascular strokes, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy and cataracts, abnormal muscle cell histopathology and mitochondrial function. One proband had very abnormal mitochondria with citrate synthase crystals visible in electron micrographs, associated with markedly high citrate synthase activity. Exome sequencing was used to identify mutations in the AGK gene in the index patient. Targeted sequencing confirmed the same homozygous mutation (c.3G>A, p.M1I) in the brother. The second family had four affected members, of which we examined two. They also presented with similar clinical symptoms, but no strokes. Postmortem heart and skeletal muscle tissues showed low complex I, III and IV activities in the heart, but normal in the muscle. Skin fibroblasts showed elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios and low complex I+III activity. Targeted sequencing led to identification of a homozygous c.979A>T, p.K327* mutation. AGK is located in the mitochondria and phosphorylates monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid. Disruption of these signaling molecules affects the mitochondria's response to superoxide radicals, resulting in oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, lipids and proteins, and stimulation of cellular detoxification pathways. High levels of manganese superoxide dismutase protein were detected in all four affected individuals, consistent with increased free radical damage. Phosphatidic acid is also involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and its loss will result in changes to the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These effects manifest as cataract formation in the eye, respiratory chain dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in heart tissue. These two pedigrees confirm that mutation of AGK is responsible for the severe neonatal presentation of Sengers syndrome.

Determining the viscoelastic properties of such biomaterials and the factors governing their failure profiles, however, has proven challenging, although collecting extensive data regarding their tensile behavior is straightforward. The easily calculated Young's modulus remains the most reported mechanical measure, regardless of its limitations, even though single-relaxation-time (SRT) models can provide much more information, which remain scarce due to a lack of manageable tools for implementing these models. We developed an easy-to-use algorithm for applying the Zener SRT model and determining the elastic moduli, viscosity, and failure profiles of materials under different mechanical tests in a user-independent manner. The algorithm was validated on the data resulting from tensile tests on native and decellularized porcine cardiac tissue, previously suggested as a promising scaffold material for cardiac tissue engineering. This analysis yields new and more accurate measurements such as the elastic moduli and viscosity, the model's relaxation time, and information on the factors governing the materials' failure profiles. These measurements indicate that the viscoelasticity and strength of the decellularized acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) are similar to those of native tissue, although its elasticity and apparent viscosity are higher. Nonetheless, reseeding and culturing the ECM with mesenchymal stem cells was shown to partially restore the mechanical properties lost after decellularization.

Translocation-dependent eNOS activation was similar in both groups. The same holds true for eNOS phosphorylation at Ser114. eNOS phosphorylation at Ser635 was significantly increased, whereas eNOS phosphorylation of Ser1177 was significantly decreased in the diabetic group paralleled by a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and Thr495. These alterations were accompanied by a significant decrease in nitrotyrosine. After application of angiotensin II (10 \u03bcM, 2 min) for investigation of the AT-receptor-dependent eNOS stimulation, we did not find differences between the increases in eNOS Ser1177-phosphorylation in the nondiabetic (+39.7 \u00b1 23.5%) and in the diabetic group (32.22 \u00b1 11.45%). A simultaneous increase in Akt phosphorylation could not be observed. The present study indicates that T2D goes along with a decrease in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 under basal conditions in cardiac tissue. Whether this may be attributed to the insulin resistance of cardiac muscle has to be further investigated.

{"title": "FoxO1 is crucial for sustaining cardiomyocyte metabolism and cell survival.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a term used to describe cardiac muscle damage-induced heart failure. Multiple structural and biochemical reasons have been suggested to induce this disorder. The most prominent feature of the diabetic myocardium is attenuated insulin signalling that reduces survival kinases (Akt), potentially switching on protein targets like FoxOs, initiators of cell death. FoxO1, a prominent member of the forkhead box family and subfamily O of transcription factors and produced from the FKHR gene, is involved in regulating metabolism, cell proliferation, oxidative stress response, immune homeostasis, pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and cell death. In this review we describe distinctive functions of FoxOs, specifically FoxO1 under conditions of nutrient excess, insulin resistance and diabetes, and its manipulation to restore metabolic equilibrium to limit cardiac damage due to cell death. Because FoxO1 helps cardiac tissue to combat a variety of stress stimuli, it could be a major determinant in regulating diabetic cardiomyopathy. In this regard, we highlight studies from our group and others who illustrate how cardiac tissue-specific FoxO1 deletion protects the heart against cardiomyopathy and how its down-regulation in endothelial tissue could prevent against atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, we also describe studies that show FoxO1's beneficial qualities by highlighting their role in inducing anti-oxidant, autophagic, and anti-apoptotic genes under stress conditions of ischaemia-reperfusion and myocardial infarction. Thus, the aforementioned FoxO1 traits could be useful in curbing cardiac tissue-specific impairment of function following diabetes.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2012-12-25", "authors": ["PrasanthPuthanveetil", "AndreaWan", "BrianRodrigues"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvs426"}
{"title": "Challenge of chronically infected mice with homologous trypanosoma cruzi parasites enhances the immune response but does not modify cardiopathy: implications for the design of a therapeutic vaccine.", "abstract": "Chagas disease is a Trypanosoma cruzi-induced zoonosis that has no natural cure. Local damage induced by the parasite and the immune response causes chronic heart and digestive lesions. Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed because there is no effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the host-parasite equilibrium to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4(+) memory cells and the CD4(+) T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8(+) memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG1 levels and mixed TH1/TH2 cytokine production. Moreover, there were no significant changes in cardiac lesions and subpatent parasitemias. In conclusion, we believe that this study may help in elucidating the necessary elements for a successful therapeutic vaccine which may reduce cardiomyopathy in chronically infected human patients.", "journal": "Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI", "date": "2012-12-21", "authors": ["Christian EmersonRosas-Jorquera", "Luiz RobertoSardinha", "Fernando DelgadoPretel", "Andr\u00e9 LuisBombeiro", "Maria ReginaD'Imp\u00e9rio Lima", "Jos\u00e9 MariaAlvarez"], "doi": "10.1128/CVI.00032-12\n10.1371/journal.ppat.0020077\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000578\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002699"}

DCM was induced in 50 rats by 6 weeks doxorubicin treatment (2.5 mg/kg/week). After 38 drug-free days, rats underwent either implantation of EHT (DCM-EHT, n = 13), which was sutured around the ventricles, or sham operation (DCM-Sham, n = 12). Eleven untreated healthy rats served as the control group. Rats were investigated using a Millar catheter for pressure-volume loop recording, and by echocardiography 30 days after operation. Thereafter, the hearts were excised and investigated functionally, histologically, and biochemically. Doxorubicin led to the development of DCM with reduced fractional shortening (FS), reduced dP/dt(max), increased systolic and diastolic LV diameters, and reduced response to dobutamine. In DCM-Sham, these changes were further enhanced, while in DCM-EHT we found improved FS, dP/dt(max), and dobutamine responsiveness. In isolated hearts, electrical multielectrode mapping revealed that EHT was electrically activated synchronously to the recipient heart.

{"title": "Pressure overload differentially affects respiratory capacity in interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria.", "abstract": "Years ago a debate arose as to whether two functionally different mitochondrial subpopulations, subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), exist in heart muscle. Nowadays potential differences are often ignored. Presumably, SSM are providing ATP for basic cell function, whereas IFM provide energy for the contractile apparatus. We speculated that two distinguishable subpopulations exist that are differentially affected by pressure overload. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transverse aortic constriction for 20 wk or sham operation. Contractile function was assessed by echocardiography. Heart tissue was analyzed by electron microscopy. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, and respiratory capacity was analyzed using a Clark electrode. Pressure overload induced left ventricular hypertrophy with increased posterior wall diameter and impaired contractile function. Mitochondrial state 3 respiration in control was 50% higher in IFM than in SSM. Pressure overload significantly impaired respiratory rates in both IFM and SSM, but in SSM to a lower extent. As a result, there were no differences between SSM and IFM after 20 wk of pressure overload. Pressure overload reduced total citrate synthase activity, suggesting reduced total mitochondrial content. Electron microscopy revealed normal morphology of mitochondria but reduced total mitochondrial volume density. In conclusion, IFM show greater respiratory capacity in the healthy rat heart and a greater depression of respiratory capacity by pressure overload than SSM. The differences in respiratory capacity of cardiac IFM and SSM in healthy hearts are eliminated with pressure overload-induced heart failure. The strong effect of pressure overload on IFM together with the simultaneous appearance of mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction may support the notion of IFM primarily producing ATP for contractile function.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We aimed to distinguish the influence of cell-cell coupling between myocytes and MSCs from that of MSC-derived paracrine factors on the spontaneous activity and conduction velocity (\u03b8) of multicellular cardiomyocyte preparations. HL-1 cells were plated on microelectrode arrays and their spontaneous activity and \u03b8 was determined from field potential recordings. In heterocellular cultures of MSCs and HL-1 cells the beating frequency was attenuated (t(0h): 2.26 \u00b1 0.18 Hz; t(4h): 1.98 \u00b1 0.26 Hz; P < 0.01) concomitant to the intercellular coupling between MSCs and cardiomyocytes. In HL-1 monolayers supplemented with MSC conditioned media (ConM) or tyrode (ConT) \u03b8 significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (ConT: t(0h): 2.4 cm/s \u00b1 0.2; t(4h): 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 cm/s), whereas the beating frequency remained constant. Connexin (Cx)43 mRNA and protein expression levels also increased after ConM or ConT treatment over the same time period. Enhanced low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation after ConT treatment implicates the Wnt signaling pathway. Suppression of Wnt secretion from MSCs (IWP-2; 5 \u03bcmol/l) reduced the efficacy of ConT to induce phospho-LRP6 and to increase \u03b8. Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin (cardamonin; 10 \u03bcmol/l) or GSK3-\u03b1/\u03b2 (LiCl; 5 mmol/l) also suppressed changes in \u03b8, further supporting the hypothesis that MSC-mediated Cx43 upregulation occurs in part through secreted Wnt ligands and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Over the past decade, stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel strategy for patients with ischemic heart disease and its beneficial effects have been demonstrated by substantial preclinical and clinical studies. Efficacy of several types of stem cells in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases has already been evaluated. However, repair of injured myocardium through stem cell transplantation is restricted by critical safety issues and ethic concerns. Recently, the discovery of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) that reside in the heart itself brings new prospects for myocardial regeneration and reconstitution of cardiac tissues. CSCs are positive for various stem cell markers and have the potential of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. They play a pivotal role in the maintenance of heart homeostasis and cardiac repair.

We have examined at cellular and molecular level the proliferation, apoptosis and commitment of CPCs isolated from normal (CPC-N) and age-matched pathological adult human hearts (CPC-P) with ischemic heart disease. In the CPC-P, genes related to early stages of developmental processes, nervous system development and neurogenesis, skeletal development, bone and cartilage development were downregulated, while those involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation and heart development were upregulated, together with the transcriptional activation of TGF\u03b2/BMP signaling pathway. In the pathological heart, asymmetric division was the prevalent type of cardiac stem cell division. The population of CPC-P consisted mainly of progenitors of cardiac cell lineages and less precursors; these cells proliferated more, but were also more susceptible to apoptosis with respect to CPC-N.

OVE26 mice develop hyperglycemia at 2-3 wk after birth and exhibit albuminuria and cardiac dysfunction at 3 mo of age.

Diabetic mice showed significant cardiac dysfunction, including increased left ventricular systolic diameter and wall thickness and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with an increase of the heart weight-to-tibia length ratio. Diabetic hearts exhibited structural derangement and remodeling (fibrosis and hypertrophy). In diabetic mice, there was also increased systemic and cardiac oxidative damage and inflammation.

{"title": "High dietary fat selectively increases catalase expression within cardiac mitochondria.", "abstract": "Obesity is a predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One consequence of obesity is dyslipidemia characterized by high blood triglycerides. It has been proposed that oxidative stress, driven by utilization of lipids for energy, contributes to these diseases. The effects of oxidative stress are mitigated by an endogenous antioxidant enzyme network, but little is known about its response to high fat utilization. Our experiments used a multiplexed quantitative proteomics method to measure antioxidant enzyme expression in heart tissue in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. This experiment showed a rapid and specific up-regulation of catalase protein, with subsequent assays showing increases in activity and mRNA. Catalase, traditionally considered a peroxisomal protein, was found to be present in cardiac mitochondria and significantly increased in content and activity during high fat feeding. These data, coupled with the fact that fatty acid oxidation enhances mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, suggest that a localized catalase increase is needed to consume excessive mitochondrial H(2)O(2) produced by increased fat metabolism. To determine whether the catalase-specific response is a common feature of physiological conditions that increase blood triglycerides and fatty acid oxidation, we measured changes in antioxidant expression in fasted versus fed mice. Indeed, a similar specific catalase increase was observed in mice fasted for 24 h. Our findings suggest a fundamental metabolic process in which catalase expression is regulated to prevent damage while preserving an H(2)O(2)-mediated sensing of diet composition that appropriately adjusts insulin sensitivity in the short term as needed to prioritize lipid metabolism for complete utilization.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-12-04", "authors": ["Paul MRindler", "Scott MPlafker", "Luke ISzweda", "MichaelKinter"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.412890\n10.1074/mcp.M111.013987"}

In the pilot experimental study presented we investigated cellular and molecular effects of RIPC in heart tissue of cardiosurgical patients with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and focussed on apoptotic events, local and systemic inflammation as well as the regulation of the hypoxia induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). RIPC was induced by four 5-min cycles of transient upper limb ischemia/reperfusion using a blood-pressure cuff. Right atrial tissue and serum were obtained from patients receiving RIPC (N = 32) and control patients (N = 29) before and after CPB. RIPC patients showed reduced troponin T serum concentrations in the first 48 h after surgery (P < 0.05 vs. control) indicating cardioprotective effects of RIPC. Samples from RIPC patients that were collected before CPB contained significantly increased amounts of HIF-1\u03b1 and procaspase-3 (HIF-1\u03b1: P < 0.05 vs. control, procaspase-3: P < 0.05 vs. control), whereas activities of caspases 3 and 7 were by trend reduced. Samples from RIPC patients that were taken after CPB showed an increased activity of myeloperoxidase (P < 0.05 vs. control; P < 0.05 vs. RIPC before CPB) as well as elevated tissue concentrations of the interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (P < 0.05 vs. RIPC before CPB). Serum levels of IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 were significantly increased in RIPC patients before CPB (P < 0.05 vs. control before CPB).

Sodium arsenite (5\u2009mg/kg/b.wt) was orally administered once a day for 30 days to the animals to induce cardiotoxicity. After the experimental period, cardiotoxicity was assessed by estimating the levels of lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidant status (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, total reduced glutathione, protein sulfyhydryl and non-protein sulfhydryl groups) and DNA fragmentation in the cardiac tissue of control and experimental rats. In addition, cardiac tissue specific serum markers (triacylglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol) in serum and histopathological changes in the cardiac tissue were also evaluated. From the results obtained in our study, sodium arsenite administration to the rats increased lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, triacylglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas antioxidant status and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found to be reduced. However, p-coumaric acid (75 and100\u2009mg/kg/b.wt) treatment orally once per day for 30 days, immediately before a daily administration of sodium arsenite protected the abnormal biochemical abnormalities observed in the cardiac tissue of sodium arsenite treated rats as evidenced by the cardiac histopathology. For comparison purpose, a standard antioxidant vitamin C (100\u2009mg/kg/b.wt) was used.

With an ultimate goal of both delivering cells and providing mechanical support to the healing heart, we designed three-dimensional (3D) elastomeric scaffolds with (1) stiffnesses and anisotropy mimicking explanted myocardial specimens as predicted by finite-element (FE) modeling, (2) systematically varied combinations of rectangular pore pattern, pore aspect ratio, and strut width, and (3) structural features approaching tissue scale. Based on predicted mechanical properties, three scaffold designs were selected from eight candidates for fabrication from poly(glycerol sebacate) by micromolding from silicon wafers. Large 20\u00d720\u2009mm scaffolds with high aspect ratio features (5:1 strut height:strut width) were reproducibly cast, cured, and demolded at a relatively high throughput. Empirically measured mechanical properties demonstrated that scaffolds were cardiac mimetic and validated FE model predictions. Two-layered scaffolds providing fully interconnected pore networks were fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly. C2C12 myoblasts cultured on one-layered scaffolds exhibited specific patterns of cell elongation and interconnectivity that appeared to be guided by the scaffold pore pattern.

At test concentrations encompassing free plasma concentrations associated with clinical efficacy for conversion of atrial fibrillation, vernakalant (1-10 \u03bcM) displayed no significant direct effects on human resistance artery tone or ventricular contractility. In contrast, tested at equimolar concentrations, flecainide significantly reduced peak isometric contractile force (10 \u03bcM) and maximal rates of force development and decline (3 and 10 \u03bcM) in the human ventricular muscle preparation while displaying no significant effect on human resistance artery tone. The lack of effects of vernakalant on human resistance artery tone and ventricular muscle contractile function suggests that direct vasorelaxant and inotropic effects do not underlie the rare hypotensive events observed clinically with vernakalant, raising the possibility that secondary (eg, reflex) effects may mediate these events.

{"title": "A bio-inspired platform to modulate myogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells through focal adhesion regulation.", "abstract": "The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cardiac-tissue engineering has gained widespread attention and many reports have shown that matrix compliance, micro/nano-patterns could be some of the important biophysical cues that drive hMSCs differentiation. Regardless of the type of biophysical induction cues, cells mainly explore their environment via focal adhesion (FA) and FA plays an important role in many cellular behaviours. Therefore, it is hypothesized that FA modulation through materials manipulation could be an important cue for modulation that would result in the stem cell lineage commitment. In this work, the FA of hMSCs is modulated by a novel microcontact printing method using polyvinyl alcohol as a trans-print media which can successfully print proteins on soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The FA is successfully modified into dense FA and elongated FA by micropatterning square and rectangular patterns on 12.6 kPa PDMS respectively. Additionally, the combined effects of stiffness of PDMS substrates (hard (308 kPa), intermediate (12.6 kPa)) and FA patterning on hMSCs differentiation are studied. The results indicate that dense FA does not induce myogenesis while elongated FA can promote cytoskeleton alignment and further myogenesis on PDMS with intermediate stiffness of 12.6 kPa. However, on stiff substrate (308 kPa), with or without patterns, the cytoskeleton alignment and myogenesis are not obvious. This demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to induce the differentiation of hMSCs by regulating the FA using a materials platform even in the absence of any biochemical factors. It also shows that there is a synergistic effect between FA regulation and matrix stiffness that results in a more specific and higher up-regulated myogenesis. This platform presents a new chemical/biological-free method to engineer the myogenic differentiation of hMSCs.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["HaiyangYu", "Chor YongTay", "MintuPal", "Wen ShingLeong", "HuaqiongLi", "HaiLi", "FengWen", "David TaiLeong", "Lay PohTan"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201200142"}

Active interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a key product of the inflammasome, being cleaved by active caspase-1. The aim of this study was to dissect the role of IL-1\u03b2 from that of the inflammasome by using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against IL-1\u03b2 and measuring the intensity of the inflammatory response, the activity of caspase-1 in the inflammasome, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac remodelling in a mouse model of non-reperfused AMI.

Here, we further investigate the role of FPPS in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF) using a transgenic (Tg) model, and its mechanisms.\nTg mice with cardiac-specific expression of FPPS were studied as an experimental model. The results showed that Tg mice with overexpression of FPPS exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and HF, as well as increased synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in heart tissue. These pathological changes were associated with the activation of RhoA and other known kinases in the hypertrophic signalling pathway, such as extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 and p38. Adenoviral infection of FPPS in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes induced a hypertrophic response characterized by an increased cell size and an increased extent of sarcomeric organization, as well as an increased activation profile of small GTPases and downstream protein kinases concordant with those seen in vivo. Further investigation showed a marked increase of FPPS protein levels in hypertrophic ventricles of patients with valvular heart disease.\nTaken together, these results suggest that FPPS may function as a potent regulator in myocardial remodelling.

Quantification of multislice arterial spin labeling is not straightforward due to the large volume of blood inverted following slice-selective inversion. For bpMBF quantification, a direct measurement of the left-ventricle blood pool magnetization was used to approximate the blood input function into the Bloch equations. Simulations and in vivo measurements in the mouse heart were performed to evaluate the bpMBF method.\nMeasurements indicated that blood pool magnetization requires \u223c3 s to return to equilibrium following slice-selective inversion. Simulation and in vivo results show that bpMBF quantification is robust to variations in slice-selective thickness and therefore applicable to multislice acquisition, whereas traditional methods are likely to underestimate multislice perfusion. In vivo, single and multislice perfusion values matched well when quantified using bpMBF.\nThe first multislice cardiac arterial spin labeling technique has been presented, which can be used for accurate perfusion measurements in studies of cardiac disease.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2012-11-22", "authors": ["Adrienne ECampbell-Washburn", "HuiZhang", "Bernard MSiow", "Anthony NPrice", "Mark FLythgoe", "Roger JOrdidge", "David LThomas"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.24545"}

We found that there are substantial differences in the quantitative protein profiles of ECM in SDS-treated heart tissue compared to that of liver tissue, as assessed by iTRAQ\u2122 quantitative proteomics analysis. When mouse ES cells were cultured on thin (60\u00a0\u03bcm) sections of de-cellularized tissue, the expression of cardiac myosin heavy chain (cMHC) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was high in ES cells cultured on heart ECM compared with those cultured on liver ECM. In addition, the protein expression of cMHC and cTnI was detected in cells on heart ECM after 2 weeks, which was not detectable in cells on liver ECM. These results indicate that heart ECM plays a critical role in the cardiomyocyte differentiation of ES cells.

Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can cause cardiac tissue excitability and conduction. Global ventricular mechanical function is directly related to the contractile properties of cardiac myocytes, which are largely dependent on the flow of ions such as potassium and magnesium. Here, we show that increased levels of potassium, in addition to magnesium, in a patient with Gitelman's syndrome significantly impacts the timing of ventricular wall motion and the pattern of ventricular strain and torsion.

Phosphorylation of the PKA sites (Ser(23)/Ser(24)) of cardiac troponin (cTn)I results in a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and an increase in the rate of relaxation. However, the relation between the level of phosphorylation of the sites and the functional effects in the human myocardium is unknown. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the effects of phosphorylation at Ser(23) and Ser(24) of cTnI on myofilament function in human cardiac tissue. Serines were replaced by aspartic acid (D) or alanine (A) to mimic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. cTnI-DD mimics both sites phosphorylated, cTnI-AD mimics Ser(23) unphosphorylated and Ser(24) phosphorylated, cTnI-DA mimics Ser(23) phosphorylated and Ser(24) unphosphorylated, and cTnI-AA mimics both sites unphosphorylated. Force development was measured at various Ca(2+) concentrations in permeabilized cardiomyocytes in which the endogenous troponin complex was exchanged with these recombinant human troponin complexes. In donor cardiomyocytes, myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)) was significantly lower in cTnI-DD (pCa(50): 5.39 \u00b1 0.01) compared with cTnI-AA (pCa(50): 5.50 \u00b1 0.01), cTnI-AD (pCa(50): 5.48 \u00b1 0.01), and cTnI-DA (pCa(50): 5.51 \u00b1 0.01) at ~70% cTn exchange. No effects were observed on the rate of tension redevelopment. In cardiomyocytes from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic tissue, a linear decline in pCa(50) with cTnI-DD content was observed, saturating at ~55% bisphosphorylation. Our data suggest that in the human myocardium, phosphorylation of both PKA sites on cTnI is required to reduce myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, which is maximal at ~55% bisphosphorylated cTnI.

We produced primary and secondary cardiospheres (CSs) using repeated three-dimensional culture strategy and characterized the cells. Approximately 5000 secondary CSs were acquired after 45 days. Genetic analysis confirmed that the progenitor cells in the secondary CSs originated from the innate heart, but not from extra-cardiac organs. The expressions of Oct4 and Nanog were significantly induced in secondary CSs compared with adherent cells derived from primary CSs. Those expressions in secondary CSs were higher in a cytokine-deprived medium than in a cytokine-supplemented one, suggesting that formation of the three-dimensional structure was important to enhance stemness whereas supplementation with various cytokines was not essential. Signal blocking experiments showed that the ERK and VEGF pathways are indispensable for sphere formation. To optimize cell processing, we compared four different methods of generating spheres. Method based on the hanging-drop or AggreWell\u2122 was superior to that based on the poly-d-lysine-coated dish or Petri dish with respect to homogeneity of the product, cellular potency and overall simplicity of the process. When transplanted into the ischemic myocardium of immunocompromised mice, human secondary CSs differentiated into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that generation of secondary CSs from a small quantity of adult human cardiac tissue is a feasible and effective cell processing strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cell therapy.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-10-30", "authors": ["Hyun-JaiCho", "Ho-JaeLee", "Yeon-JuChung", "Ju-YoungKim", "Hyun-JuCho", "Han-MoYang", "Yoo-WookKwon", "Hae-YoungLee", "Byung-HeeOh", "Young-BaePark", "Hyo-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.011"}

This property provides a candidate mechanism for generation of pathogenic ectopy in cardiac tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine the biophysical mechanism of DIA in terms of the ion conductance properties of the cardiomyocyte membrane. First, we determined, by use of the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique, the membrane conductance and DIA properties of ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat heart. Second, we reproduced and analysed DIA properties by using an adapted version of the experimentally based mathematical cardiomyocyte model of Pandit et al. (Biophys J 81:3029-3051 2001, Biophys J 84:832-841 2003) and Padmala and Demir (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 14:990-995 2003). DIA in 23 rat cardiomyocytes was a damped membrane potential oscillation with a variable number of action potentials and/or waves, depending on the strength of the depolarizing current and the particular cell. The adapted model was used to reconstruct the DIA properties of a particular cardiomyocyte from its whole-cell voltage-clamp currents. The main currents involved in DIA were an L-type calcium current (I CaL) and a slowly activating and inactivating Kv current (I ss), with linear (I B) and inward rectifier (I K1) currents acting as background currents and I Na and I t as modulators. Essential for DIA is a sufficiently large window current of a slowly inactivating I CaL combined with a critically sized repolarizing current I ss. Slow inactivation of I ss makes DIA transient. In conclusion, we established a membrane mechanism of DIA primarily based on I CaL, I ss and inward rectifier properties; this may be helpful in understanding cardiac ectopy and its treatment.", "journal": "European biophysics journal : EBJ", "date": "2012-10-24", "authors": ["Dirk LYpey", "Wilbert P Mvan Meerwijk", "SobanUmar", "Daniel APijnappels", "Martin JSchalij", "Arnoudvan der Laarse"], "doi": "10.1007/s00249-012-0866-9"}

We investigated if these requirements can be met by providing an intrinsic vascularization stimulus (via sustained action of VEGF secreted at a controlled rate by transduced myoblasts) to a cardiac patch engineered under conditions of effective oxygen supply (via medium flow through channeled elastomeric scaffolds seeded with neonatal cardiomyocytes). We demonstrate that this combined approach resulted in increased viability, vascularization and functionality of the cardiac patch. After implantation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, VEGF-expressing patches displayed significantly improved engraftment, survival and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, leading to greatly enhanced contractility as compared to controls not expressing VEGF. Controlled VEGF expression also mediated the formation of mature vascular networks, both within the engineered patches and in the underlying ischemic myocardium.

The biomaterials, cells, and scaffold design play important roles in engineering of heart tissue. In this study, we have developed a fibrin-based multiscale electrospun composite scaffold for myocardial regeneration. Fibrin is the natural wound-healing matrix having angiogenic potential and comprehensively used for tissue engineering applications. It provides a natural environment for cell attachment, migration, and proliferation. Morphological, chemical, and mechanical characterization of the scaffolds was done by scanning electron microscopy, fibrin-specific phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin staining, and mechanical testing. The fiber diameters of fibrin nanofibers range from 50 to 300 nm and that of poly (lactide-co-glycolide) microfibers range from 2 to 4 \u03bcm, which mimics the structural hierarchy of native myocardial tissue. Our results indicate that this scaffold enhances the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into cardiomyocytes.

We reported previously that rats exposed to a low-protein diet in utero and postnatal catch-up growth (recuperated) develop metabolic dysfunction and have reduced life span. Here we explored the hypothesis that cardiac oxidative and nitrosative stress leading to DNA damage and accelerated cellular aging could contribute to these phenotypes. Recuperated animals had a low birth weight (P<0.001) but caught up in weight to controls during lactation. At weaning, recuperated cardiac tissue had increased (P<0.05) protein nitrotyrosination and DNA single-stranded breaks. This condition was preceded by increased expression of DNA damage repair molecules 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1, nei-endonuclease-VIII-like, X-ray-repair-complementing-defective-repair-1, and Nthl endonuclease III-like-1 on d 3. These differences were maintained on d 22 and became more pronounced in the case of 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1 and nei-endonuclease-VIII-like. This was accompanied by increases in xanthine oxidase (P<0.001) and NADPH oxidase (P<0.05), major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The detrimental effects of increased ROS in recuperated offspring may be exaggerated at 22 d by reductions (P<0.001) in the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin-3 and CuZn-superoxide-dismutase. We conclude that poor fetal nutrition followed by accelerated postnatal growth results in increased cardiac nitrosative and oxidative-stress and DNA damage, which could contribute to age-associated disease risk.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2012-10-02", "authors": ["Jane LTarry-Adkins", "Malgorzata SMartin-Gronert", "Denise SFernandez-Twinn", "IainHargreaves", "Maria ZAlfaradhi", "John MLand", "Catherine EAiken", "Susan EOzanne"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.12-218685"}

Obesity is commonly related to cardiovascular diseases, frequently resulting in heart failure and death. To elucidate the effects of acute exercise in heart tissue from obese animals, 12-week-old C57BL6/J obese (ob/ob) and non-obese (ob/OB) mice were submitted to a single bout of swimming and had their hearts analyzed by proteomic techniques. Mice were divided into three groups: control (ob/ob, n\u2009=\u20093; ob/OB, n\u2009=\u20093); a moderate intensity consisting of 20 min of swimming around 90% of Maximal Lactate Steady State (ob/ob, n\u2009=\u20093; ob/OB, n\u2009=\u20093), and a high intensity exercise performed as an incremental overload test (ob/ob, n\u2009=\u20093; ob/OB, n\u2009=\u20093). Obesity modulations were analyzed by comparing ob/ob and ob/OB control groups. Differential 2-DE analysis revealed that single session of exercise was able to up-regulate: myoglobin (ob/ob), aspartate aminotransferase (ob/OB) and zinc finger protein (ob/OB) and down-regulate: nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (ob/OB), mitochondrial aconitase (ob/ob and ob/OB) and fatty acid binding protein (ob/ob).

Using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic profiling, we sought to decipher the relationships between the metabolism and cellular signalling pathways in human heart tissues collected from patients with ISCM, IDCM, and those without heart disease and dilation.\nThe comparative analysis suggested a decrease in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and malate-aspartate shuttle activities in both types of cardiomyopathies and an increase in ketone body oxidation only in ISCM. Chronic ischaemic injury was associated with increased DJ-1 and decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein expression. The reduced PTEN expression was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of cell-protective AKT. Phosphorylation at T845 of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins, with no change in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, was also observed.

{"title": "Novel injectable biomimetic hydrogels with carbon nanofibers and self assembled rosette nanotubes for myocardial applications.", "abstract": "The objective of the present in vitro study was to investigate cardiomyocyte functions, specifically their adhesion and proliferation, on injectable scaffolds containing RNT (rosette nanotubes) and CNF (carbon nanofibers) in a pHEMA (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) hydrogel to determine their potential for myocardial tissue engineering applications. RNTs are novel biocompatible nanomaterials assembled from synthetic analogs of DNA bases guanine and cytosine that self-assemble within minutes when placed in aqueous solutions at body temperatures. These materials could potentially improve cardiomyocyte functions and solidification time of pHEMA and CNF composites. Because heart tissue is conductive, CNFs were added to pHEMA to increase the composite's conductivity. Our results showed that cardiomyocyte density increased after 4 h, 1 day, and 3 days with greater amounts of CNFs and greater amounts of RNTs in pHEMA (up to 10 mg mL(-1) CNFs and 0.05 mg mL(-1) RNTs). Factors that may have increased cardiomyocyte functions include greater wettability, conductivity, and an increase in surface nanoroughness with greater amounts of CNFs and RNTs. In effect, contact angles measured on the surface of the composites decreased while the conductivity and surface roughness increased as CNFs and RNTs content increased. Lastly, the ultimate tensile modulus decreased for composites with greater amounts of CNFs. In summary, the properties of these injectable composites make them promising candidates for myocardial tissue engineering applications and should be further studied.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Functional 3-D cardiac co-culture model using bioactive chitosan nanofiber scaffolds.", "abstract": "The in vitro generation of a three-dimensional (3-D) myocardial tissue-like construct employing cells, biomaterials, and biomolecules is a promising strategy in cardiac tissue regeneration, drug testing, and tissue engineering applications. Despite significant progress in this field, current cardiac tissue models are not yet able to stably maintain functional characteristics of cardiomyocytes for long-term culture and therapeutic purposes. The objective of this study was to fabricate bioactive 3-D chitosan nanofiber scaffolds using an electrospinning technique and exploring its potential for long-term cardiac function in the 3-D co-culture model. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide biomaterial that is biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and cost effective. Electrospun chitosan was utilized to provide structural scaffolding characterized by scale and architectural resemblance to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo. The chitosan fibers were coated with fibronectin via adsorption in order to enhance cellular adhesion to the fibers and migration into the interfibrous milieu. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were harvested from neonatal rats and studied in various culture conditions (i.e., mono- and co-cultures) for their viability and function. Cellular morphology and functionality were examined using immunofluorescent staining for alpha-sarcomeric actin (SM-actin) and gap junction protein, Connexin-43 (Cx43). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy were used to investigate cellular morphology, spatial organization, and contractions. Calcium indicator was used to monitor calcium ion flux of beating cardiomyocytes. The results demonstrate that the chitosan nanofibers retained their cylindrical morphology in long-term cell cultures and exhibited good cellular attachment and spreading in the presence of adhesion molecule, fibronectin. Cardiomyocyte mono-cultures resulted in loss of cardiomyocyte polarity and islands of non-coherent contractions. However, the cardiomyocyte-fibroblast co-cultures resulted in polarized cardiomyocyte morphology and retained their morphology and function for long-term culture. The Cx43 expression in the fibroblast co-culture was higher than the cardiomyocytes mono-culture and endothelial cells co-culture. In addition, fibroblast co-cultures demonstrated synchronized contractions involving large tissue-like cellular networks. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to test chitosan nanofiber scaffolds as a 3-D cardiac co-culture model. Our results demonstrate that chitosan nanofibers can serve as a potential scaffold that can retain cardiac structure and function. These studies will provide useful information to develop a strategy that allows us to generate engineered 3-D cardiac tissue constructs using biocompatible and biodegradable chitosan nanofiber scaffolds for many tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2012-09-20", "authors": ["AliHussain", "GeorgeCollins", "DerekYip", "Cheul HCho"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.24727"}
{"title": "Early functional and transcriptomic changes in the myocardium predict outcome in a long-term rat model of sepsis.", "abstract": "Myocardial function is depressed in sepsis and is an important prognosticator in the human condition. Using echocardiography in a long-term fluid-resuscitated Wistar rat model of faecal peritonitis we investigated whether depressed myocardial function could be detected at an early stage of sepsis and, if so, whether the degree of depression could predict eventual outcome. At 6 h post-insult, a stroke volume <0.17 ml prognosticated 3-day mortality with positive and negative predictive values of 93 and 80%, respectively. Subsequent fluid loading studies demonstrated intrinsic myocardial depression with poor-prognosis animals tolerating less fluid than either good-prognosis or sham-operated animals. Cardiac gene expression analysis at 6 h detected 527 transcripts significantly up- or down-regulated by the septic process, including genes related to inflammatory and cell cycle pathways. Predicted mortality was associated with significant differences in transcripts of genes expressing proteins related to the TLR2/MyD88 (Toll-like receptor 2/myeloid differentiation factor 88) and JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) inflammatory pathways, \u03b2-adrenergic signalling and intracellular calcium cycling.

{"title": "A functional variant in the cystathionine \u03b2-synthase gene promoter significantly reduces congenital heart disease susceptibility in a Han Chinese population.", "abstract": "Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases. There are two ways to remove homocysteine from embryonic cardiac cells: remethylation to form methionine or transsulfuration to form cysteine. Cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first step of homocysteine transsulfuration as a rate-limiting enzyme. In this study, we identified a functional variant -4673C>G (rs2850144) in the CBS gene promoter region that significantly reduces the susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD) in a Han Chinese population consisting of 2 340 CHD patients and 2 270 controls. Individuals carrying the heterozygous CG and homozygous GG genotypes had a 15% (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-0.96, P = 0.011) and 40% (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, P = 1.78 \u00d7 10(-7)) reduced risk to develop CHD than the wild-type CC genotype carriers in the combined samples, respectively. Additional stratified analyses demonstrated that CBS -4673C>G is significantly related to septation defects and conotruncal defects. In vivo detection of CBS mRNA levels in human cardiac tissues and in vitro luciferase assays consistently showed that the minor G allele significantly increased CBS transcription. A functional analysis revealed that both the attenuated transcription suppressor SP1 binding affinity and the CBS promoter hypomethylation specifically linked with the minor G allele contributed to the remarkably upregulated CBS expression. Consequently, the carriers with genetically increased CBS expression would benefit from the protection due to the low homocysteine levels maintained by CBS in certain cells during the critical heart development stages. These results shed light on unexpected role of CBS and highlight the importance of homocysteine removal in cardiac development.Cell Research advance online publication 18 September 2012; doi:10.1038/cr.2012.135.", "journal": "Cell research", "date": "2012-09-19", "authors": ["Jian-YuanZhao", "Xue-YanYang", "Kai-HuShi", "Shu-NaSun", "JiaHou", "Zhi-ZhouYe", "JueWang", "Wen-YuanDuan", "BinQiao", "Yi-JiangChen", "Hong-BingShen", "Guo-YingHuang", "LiJin", "Hong-YanWang"], "doi": "10.1038/cr.2012.135"}

This issue was studied in a prolonged cardiac arrest model consisting of 25 min cardiac arrest in a rat resuscitated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of hyperoxygenation following prolonged cardiac arrest resuscitation on mitochondrial and cardiac function.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and instrumented for closed chest cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Following a 25-min KCl-induced cardiac arrest, the animals were resuscitated by CPB with 100% oxygen. Three minutes after successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals received either normoxemic reperfusion (CPB with 40-50% oxygen) or hyperoxemic reperfusion (CPB with 100% oxygen) for 1 h. Post-resuscitation hemodynamics, cardiac function, mitochondrial function and immunostaining of 3-nitrotyrosine were compared between the two different treatment groups.\nAt 1 h after ROSC, the hyperoxemic reperfusion group had a significant higher mean arterial pressure, less metabolic acidosis and better diastolic function than the normoxemic reperfusion group. Cardiac mitochondria from the hyperoxemic reperfusion group had a higher respiratory control ratio (RCR) and cardiac tissue showed less nitroxidative stress compared to the normoxemic reperfusion group.\nOne hour of hyperoxemic reperfusion after 25 min of cardiac arrest in an in vivo CPB model resulted in significant short-term improvement in myocardial and mitochondrial function compared with 1h of normoxemic reperfusion.

Oligomeric grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) have been shown to be potent antioxidants and free radical scavengers. Mice were treated with DOCA-salt to induce CR and were given distilled water or oligomeric GSPs for 4 weeks. The heart weight (HW) index and kidney weight (KW) index were expressed as heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) and kidney weight/body weight (KW/BW); the histological changes were investigated by hematoxylin and eosin and Van Gieson staining.The endothelial-dependent vasodilation function induced by acetylcholine was investigated in isolated thoracic aorta ring. Colorimetric analysis was used to assay superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and nitric oxide (NO) content in serum and hydroxyproline content in cardiac tissue. Administration of GSPs markedly alleviated the elevation of HW/BW ratio, KW/BW ratio and cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, decreased collagen deposition in heart and attenuated histopathology injury, and improves endothelial-dependent aorta ring relaxation in vitro accompany by increasing of NO content in serum. Meanwhile, treatment with GSPs significantly ameliorated oxidative stress via increasing SOD activities and decreasing MDA formation. These findings suggest that administration of GSPs has the potential to attenuate DOCA-salt induced CR and KH and preserve NO activity and endothelial function, which mechanism may contribute to its antioxidant characteristic, at least in part.", "journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "date": "2012-08-21", "authors": ["Xing-huiWang", "Ling-lingHuang", "Ting-tingYu", "Jin-hangZhu", "BingShen", "YeZhang", "Hong-zhiWang", "ShanGao"], "doi": "10.1002/ptr.4793"}
{"title": "Tissue retention of doxorubicin and its effects on cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle function.", "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue is a pervasive syndrome experienced by a majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, and muscular dysfunction may be a key component in the development and progression of this syndrome. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of many cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of DOX exposure on the function of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues and examine the role accumulation of DOX may play in this process. In these studies, rats were treated with DOX and measurements of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle function were assessed 1, 3, and 5 days after exposure. All muscular tissues showed significant and severe dysfunction, yet there was heterogeneity both in the time course of dysfunction and in the accumulation of DOX. Cardiac and skeletal muscle exhibited a time-dependent progressive decline in function during the 5 days following DOX treatment. In contrast, vascular function showed a decline in function that could be characterized as rapid onset and was sustained for the duration of the 5-day observation period. DOX accumulation was greatest in cardiac tissue, yet all muscular tissues showed a similar degree of dysfunction. Our data suggest that in muscular tissues both DOX-dependent and DOX-independent mechanisms may be involved with the muscular dysfunction observed following DOX treatment. Furthermore, this study highlights the fact that dysfunction of skeletal and smooth muscle may be an underappreciated aspect of DOX toxicity and may be a key component of cancer-related fatigue in these patients.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2012-08-15", "authors": ["ReidHayward", "DavidHydock", "NoahGibson", "StephanieGreufe", "EricBredahl", "TraciParry"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-012-0200-0"}

Primary metabolism of TCE in adult rodent models is by specific hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (Lash et al. in Environ Health Perspect 108:177-200, 2000). As association of TCE exposure with cardiac defects is in exposed embryos prior to normal liver development, we investigated metabolism of TCE in the early embryo. Developing chick embryos were dosed in ovo with environmentally relevant doses of TCE (8 and 800 ppb) and RNA was extracted from cardiac and extra-cardiac tissue (whole embryo without heart). Real-time PCR showed upregulation of CYP2H1 transcripts in response to TCE exposure in the heart. No detectable cytochrome expression was found in extra-cardiac tissue. As seen previously, the dose response was non-monotonic and 8 ppb elicited stronger upregulation than 800 ppb. Immunostaining for CYP2C subfamily expression confirmed protein expression and showed localization in both myocardium and endothelium. TCE exposure increased protein expression in both tissues.

Scroll waves have been observed in a variety of systems including cardiac tissue, where they are associated with cardiac arrhythmias. The disorganization of scroll waves into chaotic behavior is thought to be the mechanism of ventricular fibrillation, whose lethality is widely known. One possible mechanism for this process of scroll wave instability is negative filament tension. It was discovered in 1987 in a simple two variables model of an excitable medium. Since that time, negative filament tension of scroll waves and the resulting complex, often turbulent dynamics was studied in many generic models of excitable media as well as in physiologically realistic models of cardiac tissue. In this article, we review the work in this area from the first simulations in FitzHugh-Nagumo type models to recent studies involving detailed ionic models of cardiac tissue. We discuss the relation of negative filament tension and tissue excitability and the effects of discreteness in the tissue on the filament tension.

The aim of this study was to compare human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from different somatic cell sources regarding their generation efficiency and cardiac differentiation potential, and functionalities of cardiomyocytes.\nWe generated hiPSCs from hair keratinocytes, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and skin fibroblasts by using two different virus systems. We show that MSCs and fibroblasts are more easily reprogrammed than keratinocytes. This corresponds to higher methylation levels of minimal promoter regions of the OCT4 and NANOG genes in keratinocytes than in MSCs and fibroblasts. The success rate and reprogramming efficiency was significantly higher by using the STEMCCA system than the OSNL system. All analysed hiPSCs are pluripotent and show phenotypical characteristics similar to human embryonic stem cells. We studied the cardiac differentiation efficiency of generated hiPSC lines (n = 24) and found that MSC-derived hiPSCs exhibited a significantly higher efficiency to spontaneously differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes when compared with keratinocyte-, and fibroblast-derived hiPSCs. There was no significant difference in the functionalities of the cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs with different origins, showing the presence of pacemaker-, atrial-, ventricular- and Purkinje-like cardiomyocytes, and exhibiting rhythmic Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ sparks in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

Three doses of TPO were administered weekly for 2 weeks, and outcomes were assessed at 4 or 8 weeks post-injury.\nTPO treatment significantly improved left ventricular function, hemodynamic parameters, myocardium morphology, neovascularization and infarct size. MI damage upregulated a large cohort of gene expressions in the infarct border zone, including those functioned in cytoskeleton organization, vascular and matrix remodeling, muscle development, cell cycling and ion transport. TPO treatment significantly reversed these modulations. While phosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) was modified in MI animals, TPO treatment regulated phosphorylation of STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) protein level. TPO also increased EPC colonies in the bone marrow of MI animals.

The ability to derive patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may provide a solution to these challenges. We aimed to derive hiPSCs from heart failure (HF) patients, to induce their cardiomyocyte differentiation, to characterize the generated hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and to evaluate their ability to integrate with pre-existing cardiac tissue.\nDermal fibroblasts from two HF patients were reprogrammed by retroviral delivery of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 or by using an excisable polycistronic lentiviral vector. The resulting HF-hiPSCs displayed adequate reprogramming properties and could be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes with the same efficiency as control hiPSCs (derived from human foreskin fibroblasts). Gene expression and immunostaining studies confirmed the cardiomyocyte phenotype of the differentiating HF-hiPSC-CMs. Multi-electrode array recordings revealed the development of a functional cardiac syncytium and adequate chronotropic responses to adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation. Next, functional integration and synchronized electrical activities were demonstrated between hiPSC-CMs and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in co-culture studies. Finally, in vivo transplantation studies in the rat heart revealed the ability of the HF-hiPSC-CMs to engraft, survive, and structurally integrate with host cardiomyocytes.\nHuman-induced pluripotent stem cells can be established from patients with advanced heart failure and coaxed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, which can integrate with host cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cells for cardiac therapy: practical challenges and potential mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cell based treatments for myocardial infarction have demonstrated efficacy in the laboratory and in phase I clinical trials, but the understanding of such therapies remains incomplete. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are classically defined as maintaining the ability to generate mesenchyme-derived cell types, namely adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Recent evidence suggests these cells may in fact harbor much greater potency than originally realized, as several groups have found that MSCs can form cardiac lineage cells in vitro. Additionally, experimental coculture of MSCs with cardiomyocytes appears to improve contractile function of the latter. Bolstered by such findings, several clinical trials have begun to test MSC transplantation for improving post-infarct cardiac function in human patients. The results of these trials have been mixed, underscoring the need to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying stem cell biology. To help synthesize the breadth of studies on the topic, this paper discusses current challenges in the field of MSC cellular therapies for cardiac repair, including methods of cell delivery and the identification of molecular markers that accurately specify the therapeutically relevant mesenchymal cell types. The various possible mechanisms of MSC mediated cardiac improvement, including somatic reprogramming, transdifferentiation, paracrine signaling, and direct electrophysiological coupling are also reviewed.

The functional significance of Erbin in cardiomyocytes was determined by Erbin silencing, contraction frequency measurement and cellular apoptosis assays.\nErbin was able to form a complex with both exogenous and endogenous \u03b22-AR and Her2 in the presence of isoproterenol (ISO). Deletion of the Erbin LRR domain did not affect its binding to \u03b22-AR and Her2, whereas lacking of the PDZ domain lost the ability of Erbin. Silencing of Erbin greatly abrogated ISO-induced activation of ERK. The treatment of H9c2 cells transfected with the Erbin siRNA with ISO caused severe cell apoptosis. Knock-down of Erbin expression in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes led to a remarkable reduction of the beating frequency after ISO stimulation.\nErbin mediates catecholamine-induced \u03b22-AR/Her2 complexation and promotes catecholamine-induced activation of ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes, conferring protection of cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by chronic catecholamine stimulation.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["MingShi", "MingzhenZhao", "MeiruHu", "DanLiu", "HongCao", "LuQian", "ZhengyanYang", "YabinHu", "MingYu", "ShuoYang", "YuanfangMa", "NingGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.04.093"}

{"title": "Age and obesity-associated changes in the expression and activation of components of the AMPK signaling pathway in human right atrial tissue.", "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and premature cardiac aging. In the heart, intrinsic activation of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in the stress response to ischemia and hypertrophy. Furthermore, AMPK is an important regulator of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of obesity and aging on the AMPK signaling pathway in human cardiac tissue.\n60 male cardiac surgery patients were included in the study and divided into 4 groups (old normal weight: ON; old obese: OO; young normal weight: YN, young obese: YO) according to their body mass index (18.5-25: normal weight or 30-35: obese) and age (<55 years: young or >70: old) with 15 patients each. Right atrial tissue (RA) was analyzed for the expression of the AMPK upstream kinases CAMKK and LKB1, activation of AMPK as well as phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets ACC, eEF2, mTOR and eNOS. Epicardial adipose tissue was analyzed for the expression of the endogenous AMPK activator adiponectin. The metabolic state of all patients was further characterized in fasting blood samples.\nOld patients (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects displayed higher fasting glucose, insulin and leptin serum levels compared to the young, normal weight group, although HbA1c was below the threshold required for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Serum adiponectin as well as total adiponectin protein expression in epicardial adipose tissue was decreased in these three groups. Analyses of adiponectin isoforms by native gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms between the groups. Despite the low total serum adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, AMPK activation was high in the RA of obese patients (YO, OO). Among the AMPK upstream kinases, LKB1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with AMPK activation. While the phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets mTOR, eEF-2 and ACC was not altered, phospho-eNOS was significantly lower in old patients (ON, OO). Despite strong AMPK activation, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration were impaired in old (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects.\nThese data indicate that obesity and aging result in significant changes although many direct parameters in the AMPK signaling pathway are not changed in the same direction.

For this purpose, 3-4 months old 28 rats with 280-310\u00a0g body weights were equally divided into 4 groups (control, TCDD, PCA, TCDD\u00a0+\u00a0PCA group).

The results indicated that TCDD induced oxidative stress by increasing the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and by decreasing the levels of glutathione, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the heart tissue of rats. In contrast, PCA treatment prevents the toxic effects of TCDD on oxidative stress. In addition, histopathological alterations such as necrosis and hemorrhage occurred in TCDD group, and PCA treatment partially prevents these alterations in heart tissue.

{"title": "Microdomain heterogeneity in 3D affects the mechanics of neonatal cardiac myocyte contraction.", "abstract": "Cardiac muscle cells are known to adapt to their physical surroundings, optimizing intracellular organization and contractile function for a given culture environment. A previously developed in vitro model system has shown that the inclusion of discrete microscale domains (or microrods) in three dimensions (3D) can alter long-term growth responses of neonatal ventricular myocytes. The aim of this work was to understand how cellular contact with such a domain affects various mechanical changes involved in cardiac muscle cell remodeling. Myocytes were maintained in 3D gels over 5 days in the presence or absence of 100-\u03bcm-long microrods, and the effect of this local heterogeneity on cell behavior was analyzed via several imaging techniques. Microrod abutment resulted in approximately twofold increases in the maximum displacement of spontaneously beating myocytes, as based on confocal microscopy scans of the gel xy-plane or the myocyte long axis. In addition, microrods caused significant increases in the proportion of aligned myofibrils (\u226420\u00b0 deviation from long axis) in fixed myocytes. Microrod-related differences in axial contraction could be abrogated by long-term interruption of certain signals of the RhoA-/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) or protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Furthermore, microrod-induced increases in myocyte size and protein content were prevented by ROCK inhibition. In all, the data suggest that microdomain heterogeneity in 3D appears to promote the development of axially aligned contractile machinery in muscle cells, an observation that may have relevance to a number of cardiac tissue engineering interventions.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2012-03-13", "authors": ["Matthew WCurtis", "ElisaBudyn", "Tejal ADesai", "Allen MSamarel", "BrendaRussell"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-012-0384-9\n10.1002/bit.23353"}

In this study, 28 male Wistar rats weighing 200-250\u00a0g were used. The rats were divided into two groups: sham group (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and EMF group (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Rats in sham group were exposed to same conditions as the EMF group except the exposure to EMF. Rats in EMF group were exposed to a 50-Hz EMF of 3\u00a0mT for 4\u00a0h/day and 7\u00a0days/week for 2\u00a0months. After 2\u00a0months of exposure, rats were killed; the hearts were excised and evaluated. Determination of oxidative stress parameters was performed spectrophotometrically. To detect apoptotic cells, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry were performed. In EMF-exposed group, levels of lipid peroxidation significantly increased and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased compared with sham group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 immunoreactivity increased in EMF-exposed rats compared with sham. Under electron microscopy, there were mitochondrial degeneration, reduction in myofibrils, dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear vacuolization in EMF-exposed rats.

Recently, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily, has been demonstrated to be expressed in vascular cells, with important roles in vascular physiology/pathology. However, the potential cardiac function of FXR remains unclear. We investigated the cardiac expression and biological function of FXR.\nFarnesoid-X-receptor was detected in both isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Natural and synthetic FXR agonists upregulated cardiac FXR expression, stimulated myocyte apoptosis, and reduced myocyte viability dose- and time-dependently. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that FXR agonists disrupted mitochondria, characterized by mitochondrial permeability transition pores activation, mitochondrial potential dissipation, cytochrome c release, and both caspase-9 and -3 activation. Such mitochondrial apoptotic responses were abolished by siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous FXR or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial death signalling. Furthermore, low levels of FXR were detected in the adult mouse heart, with significant (\u223c2.0-fold) upregulation after myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of FXR significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis by 29.0-53.4%, decreased infarct size by 23.4-49.7%, and improved cardiac function in ischaemic/reperfused myocardium.\nThese results demonstrate that nuclear receptor FXR acts as a novel functional receptor in cardiac tissue, regulates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and contributes to MI/R injury.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2012-02-07", "authors": ["JunPu", "AncaiYuan", "PeirenShan", "ErheGao", "XiaoliangWang", "YajingWang", "Wayne BondLau", "WalterKoch", "Xin-LiangMa", "BenHe"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehs011"}

However, the involvement of PTEN in PH remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to determine the role of PTEN in pulmonary vascular remodeling using established models of PH. The study used rat models of PH, induced by monocrotaline (MCT) administration (60\u00a0mg/kg) or continuous hypoxic exposure (10% oxygen) for 3\u00a0weeks. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were used for in vitro confirmation. Development of PH was verified by hemodynamic, morphological and histopathology analyses. PTEN and key downstream proteins in pulmonary and cardiac tissues were analyzed by western blotting and RT-PCR. PTEN was significantly decreased (MCT, 53%; Hypoxia, 40%), pAkt was significantly increased (MCT, 42%; Hypoxia, 55%) in tissues of rats with PH. Similar results were observed in SMCs exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 48\u00a0h. Ubiquitination assay showed that PTEN degradation occurs via proteasomal degradation pathway. Western blotting demonstrated a significant downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins p53 and p27, and upregulation of cyclin-D1 in the lungs of both models.

We hypothesized that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) applied to the heart in a collagen matrix would outperform the same cells grown in a monolayer and directly injected for cardiac cell replacement after myocardial infarction in a rat model. When hMSC patches were transplanted to infarcted hearts, several measures for left ventricle (LV) remodelling and function were improved, including fractional area change, wall thickness, -dP/dt and LV end-diastolic pressure. Neovessel formation throughout the LV infarct wall after hMSC patch treatment increased by 37% when compared to direct injection of hMSCs. This observation was correlated with increased secretion of angiogenic factors, with accompanying evidence that these factors enhanced vessel formation (30% increase) and endothelial cell growth (48% increase) in vitro. These observations may explain the in vivo observations of increased vessel formation and improved cardiac function with patch-mediated cell delivery. Although culture of hMSC in collagen patches enhanced angiogenic responses, there was no effect on cell potency or viability.

{"title": "Towards the generation of patient-specific patches for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Millions of people are affected by such diseases in the industrialized countries, with hundreds of thousands new cases diagnosed every year. Among cardiac diseases, heart failure is the most common end-stage pathology, leading to impaired cardiac output and cardiac performance as a result of the irreversible loss of contractile cardiomyocytes. Tissue engineering holds the promise to provide personalized solutions to the problem of cardiac muscle repair. Indeed, the identification of little reservoirs of stem and progenitor cells within every body district opened new perspectives to the setup of patient-specific protocols for cardiac diseases. Nonetheless, the results of the first pre-clinical and clinical trials in which adult stem/progenitor cells were adopted pointed at the route of delivery to the injured organ as well as at the cell source as the main issues for cardiac tissue engineers. In fact, when adult stem cells were directly injected into the myocardium or delivered through bloodstream to the heart, no or few cells could be found engrafted within host tissue few days after the administration. Renewed enthusiasm was generated by the techniques set up to enrich cardiomyocytes obtained by embryonic stem cells and by the recent disclosure of the protocols to obtain reprogrammed pluripotent cells or reprogrammed cardiomyocytes out of patients' own somatic cells. In this context, additional efforts to setup efficient systems to deliver stem cells to the injured site are required. The application of forefront technologies to fabricate synthetic and hybrid scaffolds to be employed as cell delivery systems and the acknowledgement that surface physical, mechanical, chemical properties can exert specific effects on stem cells per se prompted new enthusiasm in the field. In this respect, a cardiac-specific scaffold should be able to comply with cardiac muscle architecture, be deformable as to indulge and possibly sustain cardiac contraction.

S1P3 receptor couples promiscuously to Gi, Gq, and G12/13 proteins, and its tissue distribution is widespread. Bradycardia and hypertension are clearly associated with S1P3 activation and its expression patterns in cardiac tissue. S1P3 on dendritic cells has been identified as a major exacerbating factor for mortality during sepsis by playing a role in the critical linkage of inflammation and coagulation pathways downstream of the thrombin cascade. Understanding the contributions of the individual S1P receptors has been limited by the unavailability of selective modulators for the 5 receptor subtypes. In the pilot phase of the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN), The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) reported four low micromolar agonist probes for S1P3: ML003, ML004, ML005 and ML006. The current report describes the development of ML249, a submicromolar allosteric agonist probe for S1P3. ML249 resulted from high-throughput screening using a cell-based assay employing a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct, and the G\u03b116 pathway coupling protein, followed by medicinal chemistry efforts.

Evidence is presented showing that ML249 is an allosteric agonist; it does not compete with physiological ligand S1P for binding to S1P3. In addition, ML249 is nontoxic to U2OS cells, with a CC50 >10 \u03bcM.

After 4 weeks of hyperglycaemia the enzymatic and non-enzymatic factors were measured in cardiac tissue of diabetic and control groups. Xanthine oxidase activity (XOD), Uric acid (UA) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly (p<0.01) elevated by 48, 48 and 50% respectively and the contents of glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (AA) were significantly (p<0.01) diminished by 45 and 42% respectively in diabetic rats when compared to normal. Treatment with AE and GLB normalized the content of UA, GSH, AA, MDA and the activity of XOD. No significant changes were observed in control rats treated with AE. This data suggests that hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress in the heart, but the oxidative stress defense mechanisms in the heart tissue are fairly efficacious against oxidative injury by the treatment with AE and GLB. The present study reveals that AE may provide a useful therapeutic option in the reversal of oxidative stress induced cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.", "journal": "Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie", "date": "2011-06-07", "authors": ["Rajeswara ReddySaddala", "LavanyaThopireddy", "NarasimhuluGanapathi", "Sathyavelu ReddyKesireddy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etp.2011.05.003"}
