ECs switch between growth, differentiation, motility, or apoptotic behavior in response to the local topology and composition of the ECM. Assuming the ECM medium as a statistically inhomogeneous medium (some area support sprout growth, some not), we show that the ECM can be a natural barrier to angiogenesis. We study vascular network formation for several ECM distributions and topologies, and we find an analogy with percolation. A threshold exists, under which sprouts cannot reach the tumor. During the growth of the vascular network, a competition exists between the attraction exerted by tumor and the preferred path created by the ECM. We also examined the influence of branching on the tumor vascularization. Branching is a natural phenomenon which helps the tumor become vascularized. By increasing the number of sprouts, the vascular network increases the probability of reaching the tumor, as it can explore more pathways. Our simulations show after two branching events, the vascular network is very likely to reach the tumor.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2008-11-18", "authors": ["FranckAmyot", "AlexSmall", "Hac\u00e8neBoukari", "KevinCamphausen", "AmirGandjbakhche"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2007.11.001"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of a recurrent first dorsal web space defect using acellular dermis.", "abstract": "Oncologic defects of the hand can be problematic for the reconstructive surgeon. These defects may require a delay in definitive coverage until clear margins of resection can be obtained, which can result in a prolonged period of painful dressing changes and increased risk of soft-tissue infection. In addition, reconstructive options for oncologic defects are often limited to skin grafting, which can yield functional deficits secondary to contracted healing. Currently, there is no definitive method for preventing skin graft contracture; however, acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold to enhance subsequent skin graft healing and slow this functionally debilitating process. Here, we present a patient with recurrent melanoma of the first dorsal web space. After re-resection of the melanoma, the 11 cm x 5 cm defect was reconstructed using acellular dermis as temporary coverage to allow ample time for permanent section results. Ten days later, after confirming negative margins of resection, a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was applied over the vascularized neo-dermis. Follow-up clinical examination and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaires were used to assess outcome. At 7 months, the patient had no recurrence of melanoma and a DASH functional reduction of only 6.9%. After approximately 18 months, the patient's wounds had healed with excellent cosmetic and functional results, without any evidence of a web space contracture.

{"title": "Intraoperative acute tissue expansion for the closure of large myelomeningoceles.", "abstract": "Skin closure has always been the main challenge in treating myelomeningoceles (MMCs). Most cutaneous defects can be treated with the simple undermining and primary suture of the wound edges. This is the ideal treatment, but it is not adequate in cases in which the lesions are greater than 5 cm in diameter. Numerous reconstructive procedures have been described and the results have been satisfactory. The need to mobilize large skin areas and the fact of excessive blood loss, however, are major problems in newborns. Moreover, the tissue undermining destroys most of the skin's vascularization and can harm the adaptation of the skin flaps. The authors describe a technique for primary closure of large MMC skin defects in which they use acute skin expansion during the surgical procedure.\nSkin expansion was achieved by traction of the wound edges with U-shaped sutures and without the need of skin flaps. Sixteen patients with MMCs greater than 5 cm in diameter were evaluated.\nThe MMC areas ranged from 30 to 64 cm2 (mean 45 cm2). Two suture systems were developed based on the quality of the skin edge and the size of the skin defect. Wound edge traction was performed in 10-minute periods. The edges were gradually approximated and this allowed the primary closure of the wound without undermining the tissue in all patients. In one patient skin necrosis developed, which was associated with compression of the malformed underlying vertebrae.\nSimplicity, low cost, and satisfactory results were the main advantages of the method and an increase in operative time was a disadvantage. The goal of this technique is not to replace the other methods, but the technique constitutes an effective option in the treatment of large MMCs.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2008-05-10", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 GilbertoDe Brito Henriques", "Geraldo PianettiFilho", "Sebasti\u00e3o Nataniel SilvaGusm\u00e3o", "Karina Santos WandeckHenriques", "Marcelo EllerMiranda"], "doi": "10.3171/PED-07/08/098"}
{"title": "Which hard tissue augmentation techniques are the most successful in furnishing bony support for implant placement?", "abstract": "A variety of techniques and materials have been used to establish the structural base of osseous tissue for supporting dental implants. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the most successful technique(s) to provide the necessary alveolar bone to place a dental implant and support long-term survival.\nA systematic online review of a main database and manual search of relevant articles from refereed journals were performed between 1980 and 2005. Updates and additions were made from September 2004 to May 2005. The hard tissue augmentation techniques were separated into 2 anatomic sites, the maxillary sinus and alveolar ridge. Within the alveolar ridge augmentation technique, different surgical approaches were identified and categorized, including guided bone regeneration (GBR), onlay/veneer grafting (OVG), combinations of onlay, veneer, interpositional inlay grafting (COG), distraction osteogenesis (DO), ridge splitting (RS), free and vascularized autografts for discontinuity defects (DD), mandibular interpositional grafting (MI), and socket preservation (SP). All identified articles were evaluated and screened by 2 independent reviewers to meet strict inclusion criteria. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were further evaluated for data extraction. The initial search identified a total of 526 articles from the electronic database and manual search. Of these, 335 articles met the inclusion criteria after a review of the titles and abstracts. From the 335 articles, further review of the full text of the articles produced 90 articles that provided sufficient data for extraction and analysis.\nFor the maxillary sinus grafting (SG) technique, the results showed a total of 5,128 implants placed, with follow-up times ranging from 12 to 102 months. Implant survival was 92% for implants placed into autogenous and autogenous/composite grafts, 93.3% for implants placed into allogeneic/nonautogenous composite grafts, 81% for implants placed into alloplast and alloplast/xenograft materials, and 95.6% for implants placed into xenograft materials alone. For alveolar ridge augmentation, a total of 2,620 implants were placed, with follow-up ranging from 5 to 74 months. The implant survival rate was 95.5% for GBR, 90.4% for OVG, 94.7% for DO, and 83.8% for COG. Other techniques, such as DD, RS, SP, and MI, were difficult to analyze because of the small sample size and data heterogeneity within and across studies.\nThe maxillary sinus augmentation procedure has been well documented, and the long-term clinical success/survival (> 5 years) of implants placed, regardless of graft material(s) used, compares favorably to implants placed conventionally, with no grafting procedure, as reported in other systematic reviews. Alveolar ridge augmentation techniques do not have detailed documentation or long-term follow-up studies, with the exception of GBR. However, studies that met the inclusion criteria seemed to be comparable and yielded favorable results in supporting dental implants. The alveolar ridge augmentation procedures may be more technique- and operator-experience-sensitive, and implant survival may be a function of residual bone supporting the dental implant rather than grafted bone. More in-depth, long-term, multicenter studies are required to provide further insight into augmentation procedures to support dental implant survival.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2008-04-29", "authors": ["Tara LAghaloo", "Peter KMoy"], "doi": null}

Borrowing the biological and mechanical principles from the vascularized fibular graft technique for the femoral neck, the tantalum screws have been introduced. They show an extraordinary porosity, osteoconductivity, biocompatibility and very good osteoinductivity. Vitreous tantalum can be processed to take the form of a screw, with a round medial extremity and a 25 mm threaded lateral extremity that can be inserted into the neck of the femur, thereby supporting the articular cartilage, stimulating the repair process, interrupting the interface between necrotic and healthy tissue and favoring local vascularization. We have drawn up a treatment protocol for early-stage FHN, based on the insertion of a tantalum screw into the femoral neck. The implant has a cylindrical shape, with a 10 mm diameter in the smooth part and 15 mm in the threaded part. It is available in different sizes from 70 to 130 mm, with 5 mm increments. The aim of the study is to describe the clinical and instrumental results of the tantalum screw for FHN. From June 2004 to June 2006 we performed 15 implants. The tantalum screw was inserted with an incision on the trochanteric region with traction and under X-ray control. For the clinical evaluation of the hip, we used the Harris hip score (HHS). For diagnosis and staging we used standard X-rays in two views and/or MRI, using the Steinberg classification (J Bone Joint Surg Br 77:34-41, 1995) and CT. In all cases, the osteonecrosis extended to not more than 30% of the joint surface and the cartilage was intact with no collapse. To assess the results, we compared the pre-operative and the post-operative HHS, calculated the percentage differences between the two. We then compared X-rays, CT scans and MRI before and some time after the operation to assess whether the problem had been addressed, taking into account the intracancellous edema and the possible extension of necrosis. After an average follow-up period of 15.43 +/- 5.41 months, ten implants (seven patients out of ten) were examined and all but one patient showed a marked improvement in HHS (the average increase was 127.9%), with no further progression of the disease.

{"title": "Dynamic 3-D contrast-enhanced angiography of cerebral tumours and vascular malformations.", "abstract": "We describe the applicability and clinical use of dynamic 3-D contrast-enhanced MR subtraction angiography performed at 3 T with parallel imaging and intelligent k-space readout for imaging both treated and untreated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), AV fistulae (AVFs) and brain tumours. An in-plane submillimetre spatial resolution with temporal resolution of one image per 1.3 s was obtained. The spatial resolution was comparable to that of other MRA techniques (i.e. TOF or PC MRA) while the scanning time was markedly reduced and the evaluation of both the arterial and venous vessels was possible with the same imaging sequence. Additional clinical information could be obtained for a variety of CNS disorders. Concerning AVMs, dynamic contrast-enhanced 3-D MRA helped to identify the arterial feeders, the shunting volume, and the location and size of the nidus. However, we found that the most important clinical application was the assessment of shunt occlusion following treatment (i.e. radiosurgery, surgery, or embolization) by determining the absence or presence of early venous filling following injection of contrast agent. Moreover, our MRA technique helped to noninvasively diagnose and classify arteriovenous dural shunts with regard to shunting volume, arterial feeders, and, most importantly, venous drainage pattern. For preoperative imaging of meningeomas, displacement of normal arteries, depiction of tumour feeders and anatomy of the venous system including the tributaries to the large sinuses, their patency, the location of bridging veins, and the extent of tumour vascularization could be assessed. Our findings indicate that dynamic 3-D MRA can help to reduce the scanning time by eliminating additional TOF or PC MRA sequences. With the same imaging sequence, both arterial and venous information can be obtained in a short period of time. In addition, haemodynamic information can be obtained, which may be of importance for a variety of clinical questions. The number of invasive examinations can be reduced during follow-up after treatment of AVF or AVM, and the need to treat dural AV shunts can be assessed noninvasively. In the preoperative investigation of meningeomas, all pertinent information (degree of vascularization, tumour feeders, displacement of arteries, and assessment of large veins) is obtained using a single sequence. We conclude that this MRA sequence may be an alternative to current MRA approaches and will prove an important adjunct for the diagnosis of a variety of neurovascular disorders.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2008-04-01", "authors": ["PeterReinacher", "Marcus H TReinges", "Verena ASimon", "Franz JHans", "TimoKrings"], "doi": "10.1007/s10406-007-0229-2"}
{"title": "Alteration of gene expression in rat colon mucosa after exercise.", "abstract": "The development of colon cancer is highly influenced by lifestyle factors such as nutrition and physical inactivity. Detailed biological mechanisms are thus far unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of regular treadmill exercise on gene expression in rat colon mucosa. For this purpose, 6-week-old male Wistar rats completed a stress-free voluntary treadmill exercise period of 12 weeks. Sedentary rats served as a control group. In the colon mucosa, steady-state mRNA expression levels of approximately 10,000 genes were compared between both groups by micro-array analysis (MWG rat 10K array). A total of 8846 mRNAs were detected above background level. Regular exercise led to a decreased expression of 47 genes at a threshold-factor of 2.0. Three genes were found to be up-regulated in the exercise group. The identified genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction (n=11), transport (n=8), immune system (n=7), cytoskeleton (n=6), protein targeting (n=6), metabolism (n=5), transcription (n=3) and vascularization (n=2). Among the genes regulated by regular exercise, the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2) seems to be of particular interest. Physical activity may protect against aberrant methylation by repressing the BHMT2 gene and thus contribute to a decreased risk of developing colon cancer. We have also identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) and calcium-independent phospholipase a2 (iPL-A2), all of them with markedly reduced transcript levels in the mucosa of active rats. In summary, our experiment presents the first gene expression pattern in rat colon mucosa following regular treadmill activity and represents an important step in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the preventive effect of physical activity on the development of colon cancer.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2008-03-18", "authors": ["KBuehlmeyer", "FDoering", "HDaniel", "BKindermann", "TSchulz", "HMichna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2007.04.002"}

On the malleus of both males and females, almost all of the surfaces showed a smooth fibrous appearance, characteristic of resting surface. Limited bone-forming or resorbing surfaces were identified on the malleus. As compared with the malleus, the percentage area of the resorbing surface and the vascular canal openings were higher on the incus and stapes, especially on the long process (Crus longum) of the incus and the neck of the stapes for both males and females. The percentage area occupied by the resorbing surface of the long process of the incus and the neck of the stapes correlated with that of the vascular canal openings. We consider that the malleus maintained the stable condition, while the long process of the incus and the neck of the stapes demonstrated marked bone resorption. We suppose that the bone erosion may be related to the vascularization in these regions.

{"title": "Investigation of the angiogenic programme with tissue-specific and inducible genetic approaches in mice.", "abstract": "Blood vessels form a highly organized hierarchical network throughout the vertebrate body, integrate functionally into very different tissue environments and remain remarkably adaptable to changing local requirements. The importance of a correctly formed and functional vascular network is highlighted by numerous human pathologies, which involve defects such as compromised blood circulation, destabilization of vessel walls or deregulated angiogenesis. Genetically modified mice are powerful tools for the functional characterization of genes, and can also serve as models of human diseases. However, targeted inactivation of genes essential for blood vessel morphogenesis is usually incompatible with embryonic survival, so studies in adult mice are precluded. Moreover, mutant phenotypes can be a complex combination of defects in different tissues and cell types. Tissue-specific and inducible genetic approaches allow us to overcome many of these limitations. In particular, it is possible to perform manipulations in a spatially (i.e. cell type-specific) and temporally controlled fashion, which makes possible studies throughout development and in adults. We have generated several transgenic Cre and tamoxifen-induble CreERT2 lines that enable the selective targeting of vascular cell populations.

{"title": "Negative regulators of vessel patterning.", "abstract": "Blood vessels and nerves are structurally similar, complex branched networks that require guidance to ensure their proper positioning in the body. Recent studies have demonstrated that specialized endothelial cells, resembling axonal growth cones, are located at the tips of growing capillaries. These endothelial tip cells guide outgrowing capillaries in response to gradients of extracellular matrix-bound vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here we show that endothelial tip cell formation and vessel branching are negatively regulated by the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4). Heterozygous deletion of Dll4 or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling using gamma-secretase inhibitor revealed a striking vascular phenotype, with greatly increased numbers of filopodia-extending endothelial tip cells and increased expression of tip cell marker genes compared to controls. Filopodia extension in Dll4+/- retinal vessels required VEGF and was inhibited when VEGF signalling was blocked. While VEGF expression was not significantly altered in Dll4+- retinas, Dll4+/- vessels showed increased expression of VEGF Receptor 2 and decreased expression of VEGF Receptor 1 compared to wildtype, suggesting that they could be more responsive to VEGF stimulation. In addition, expression of Dll4 in wildtype tip cells was itself decreased when VEGF signalling was blocked, indicating that Dll4 may act downstream of VEGF as a 'brake' on VEGF-mediated angiogenic sprouting. Taken together, these data reveal Dll4 as a novel negative regulator of vascular sprouting and vessel branching that is required for normal vascular network formation during development.", "journal": "Novartis Foundation symposium", "date": "2008-02-28", "authors": ["StevenSuchting", "CatarinaFreitas", "Ferdinandle Noble", "RuiBenedito", "ChristianeBr\u00e9ant", "AntonioDuarte", "AnneEichmann"], "doi": "10.1002/9780470319413.ch7"}

In group C, the free graft of periosteum took at 4 weeks with angiogenesis. The thin extremal callus was formed at 8 weeks and the repairing process almost finished at 12 weeks. Better osteogenesis was found in group D than in group E, due to the present of BMP2 gene-transfected MSCs.

The flexibility of this technology and the ability to precisely define 3D construct geometry allows issues associated with vascularization and patient-specific tissue fabrication to be directly addressed. The fabrication of reproducible scaffold structures by 2PP is important for systematic studies of cellular processes and better understanding of in vitro tissue formation. In this study, 2PP was applied for the generation of 3D scaffold-like structures, using the photosensitive organic-inorganic hybrid polymer ORMOCER (ORganically MOdified CERamics) and epoxy-based SU8 materials. By comparing the proliferation rates of cells grown on flat material surfaces and under control conditions, it was demonstrated that ORMOCER and SU8 are not cytotoxic. Additional tests show that the DNA strand breaking of GFSHR-17 granulosa cells was not affected by the presence of ORMOCER. Furthermore, gap junction conductance measurements revealed that ORMOCER did not alter the formation of cell-cell junctions, critical for functional tissue growth.

{"title": "A comparative study of iron-related metabolic parameters in the eye of three animal species.", "abstract": "In order to obtain a wider perspective of iron homeostasis in the eye, a comparative study was undertaken of several iron-related parameters (Total Iron, TI; Total Iron Binding Capacity, TIBC; Transferrin, Tf; and saturation of Tf) both in blood serum and in ocular tissues (lens, cornea, iris-ciliary body, retina) and fluids (vitreous body, aqueous humor) of several animal species (pig, cow and rat). The relative degree of oxidative stress of tissues and fluids was evaluated based on the criteria that high values of TI and Tf saturation, and low values of TIBC and Tf, would promote iron-related oxidative stress. The inclusion of both diurnal (pig, cow) and nocturnal (rat) animal species in this comparative work provided the opportunity to explore if iron homeostasis parameters are in some way influenced by the higher oxidative stress level expected in animals with diurnal living habits. This project involved also the design of new and very sensitive methods of analyses, given the fact that in many cases very small amounts of sample (i.e., aqueous humor), and/or low concentration of analytes (i.e., transferrin) are available. All results were expressed as concentration relative to mg protein as determined with the Bradford method (microplate assay). When analyzing TI/TIBC it was possible to define a loosely bound iron pool (LBIP) in ocular tissues that was proportional to the degree of vascularization of the tissues analyzed. The comparison of iron related parameters patterns within the eye and among species allowed us to reach the following conclusions: (1) The aqueous humor and vitreous body of cow and pig exhibited highest concentration of Tf and a very low saturation of Tf, while the lowest value of Tf was detected in all species in the lens; (2) TI showed the tendency to be highest in the vitreous body of cow and pig, and lowest in the lens of all three species. The very low iron concentration in the lens may effectively counteract the risk of having a low Tf level; (3) The pattern of distribution of TIBC is the same for the cow and the pig; (4) Saturation of Tf was very high in the rat aqueous, also high in the rat lens and serum; (5) Highest differences in the pattern of distribution of iron parameters in the eye among the three species studied were found between the rat and the other two species, suggesting that the nocturnal habit of living is influencing iron related parameters in the rat. Lacking the full effect of UV light on the eye, the rat apparently lives exposed to high risk iron parameters without overt pathology, but its antioxidant reserves must be minimal. For example, the combination of high TI aqueous with relatively low Tf, gives a dangerous high saturation of Tf (82%) in the rat; (6) The posterior part of the lens is exposed to high levels of iron and Tf in diurnal animals, with saturation of Tf in the vitreous in the 40% level.

However, we have frequently experienced discrepancies between results from FFRmyo and St-MPI.\nForty-two patients with single-vessel disease with 75-90% (AHA classification) stenosis and chronic ischemic heart disease were enrolled in this study. We measured FFRmyo during coronary angiography (CAG), and determined that it was less than 0.75 in all cases. We separated the cases into groups based on the results of the St-MPI, which was carried out just prior to the CAG: 18 patients showing positive stress test (group P); and 24 patients showing negative stress test (group N). We selected PCI only for the group P. We tracked both groups for 4.4 +/-0.6 years and investigated the existence or non-existence of cardiac events therein. We carried out another St-MPI one year later on the group of cases without cardiac events.\nAlthough a fatal cardiac infarction occurred in 1 case in the group P, there were no occurrences of major cardiac events (cardiac death or fatal cardiac infarctions) in the group N. Minor cardiac events (new PCI, target lesion re-vascularization: TLR, coronary artery bypass surgery and heart failure) were detected in 8 cases (44%) in the group P and 3 cases (13%) in the group N, thus being a significantly high percentage in the group P (p<0.05). In group P patients without having restenosis at 1 year after PCI, VO2 was significantly improved as compared to that before PCI. However, no significant difference in VO2 before and after followup was observed in group N.\nBecause the prognosis of patients with single-vessel stable ischemic heart disease is good, it can be inferred that the principal cardiac events therein are minor cardiac events.

Fibroblasts are an important stromal cell type encountered by metastatic tumor cells at different sites. In previous investigations, we had found that media conditioned by three metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145) induced cultured nonprostatic fibroblasts to proliferate or to express matrix-metalloproteinase-1 considered important for tumor invasion. Fibroblast-conditioned media in turn stimulate proliferation of DU-145 cells and migration of PC-3 cells. Both tumor cells and fibroblasts secrete VEGF suggesting that not only metastatic but also stromal cells at metastatic sites contribute to the vascularization of metastasis necessary for continuous growth. In order to better understand the reciprocal tumor-stroma cross-talk in molecular terms we used the mRNA extracted from stimulated and unstimulated neoplastic and fibroblastic stromal cells for cDNA array hybridization using Affymetrix chips.

Similarly, tumor surgery often involves radical resections and multiple procedures and is frequently accompanied by irradiation or chemotherapy creating an avascular bed. The aim of this study is to report the results and discuss the role of the ipsilateral pedicle vascularized fibula (IPVF) a technique used for reconstruction of tibia defects.\nReconstruction of large tibia defects 6-22 cm due to tumor resection were performed in 5 patients by ipsilateral vascularized fibula transposition. The mean age of the patients was 35.4 years (19-42) SD 9.31. The mean follow-up was 59.6 months (24-96) SD 29.2. The mean length of the bone defect was 14.6 cm (6-22) SD 6.066 and the mean time for union was 8 months (6-12) SD 2.82. Arteriography was used preoperatively in all patients to evaluate the lower limb vasculature and to select the optimal surgical approach. The osteosynthesis was stabilized by a plate.\nThere was sound union in all cases. There were only two minor complications one partial paresis of peroneal nerve and one superficial infection. The mean follow-up was 59.6 months (24-96) SD 29.2. No patient presented with any complaints with the procedure and all had good functional results.\nThe procedure was technically simple compared to free vascularized fibula and could be performed in hospital with low resources. There are several advantages: (a) achievement of bone defect reconstruction retaining periosteal and endosteal circulation, (b) preservation of a major vessel of the lower leg, (c) avoidance of difficulty and risk of microvascular technique and (d) no donor-morbidity.

Recent studies propose a central role for cells of the myeloid lineage in triggering vessel growth by releasing angiogenic factors and perhaps by incorporating directly into nascent blood vessels. We will review studies that support a critical role for myeloid cells in neovascularization, with a focus on cells that express various monocytic/dendritic cell markers, including vascular leukocytes (VLCs), Tie2+ monocytes, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)+ monocytes, among others.

{"title": "[Experimental study on eyelid reconstruction with acellular xenogenic dermal matrix].", "abstract": "To investigate the histocompatibility of acellular xenogenic pig dermal matrix (Xeno-ADM) after transplanted into the rabbit eyelids.\nThirty-eight New Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups randomly. After excising a 5 mm x 4 mm tarso-conjunctiva flap from one lower eyelid of each rabbit, Xeno-ADM and allogenic sclera were implanted in these two groups separately. Samples of implanted material were collected for histological examination in 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after the operation. RIA method was employed to determine the contents of IL-2 and IL-6 in the homogenate fluid from local tissues and in peripheral blood.\nCompared to the control group, after the operation, the conjunctival congestion, effusion, inflammatory reaction and red swelling of the eyelid subsided faster in the treated group. No rejection or necrosis occurred in transplanted rabbits. At 16 weeks after operation, SNK-q test showed there was no obvious difference in the average breadth and height of the eyelids (P > 0.05) between these two groups and normal rabbits. Histological examination of sections of eyelid tissues stained by HE staining and observed under light microscope showed that at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks postoperatively, eyelids implanted with Xeno-ADM had less inflammatory reaction, fewer lymphocytes infiltrating and higher vascularization with faster ingrowths of new collagen fibers, as compared with the sclera-implanted group. This also indicated that Xeno-ADM had a good compatibility. Statistical analysis of immunogenic indexes indicated that the level of IL-2 and IL-6 in the homogenate fluid at 6-8 weeks postoperatively was greater than those in 1, 2, 4 weeks after implantation. The level of IL-2 and IL-6 rose significantly after the operation and reached a peak value at the 6 th week (experimental group, IL-2, 0.292 81 ng/ml) and 8 th week (experimental group, IL-6, 118.258 pg/ml; control group, IL-2, 0.277 99 ng/ml and IL-6, 255.871 pg/ml). The level of IL-2 and IL-6 dropped significantly at the 12th week and raised again at the 16th week, therefore, the concentration achieved another peak value in the control group (IL-2, 1.363 41 ng/ml; IL-6, 622.863 pg/ml), which was much higher than those in the first peak. The level of IL-2 and IL-6 in peripheral blood 1 week after the transplantation was higher than the preoperative level. These two indexes increased gradually with marked fluctuation, particularly in 4 - 8 weeks after implantation, both of them reached the peak values at that period, which was similar to the inflammation reaction changes in the implanted groups. With replicated testing and analysis of variance (ANOVA), neither the type of treatment nor the time factor had any effect on the levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in the serum, and there was no significant difference between experimental group and control group (P > 0.05).\nXeno-ADM shows good histocompatibility to New Zealand rabbits, which can induce neovascular and collagen fibers grow into implanted tissues. Therefore, this can be used to support the eyelids as a substitution for the tarsus. High levels of IL-2 and IL-6 can be detected in local tissues and in the serum after Xeno-ADM transplantation, but no statistical differences present between the dynamic changes of the level of both ILs in Xeno-ADM group and allogenic sclera group. Xeno-ADM could be an ideal substitute for allogenic sclera in the reconstruction of eye lids and could be used broadly in ophthalmology.

HCC is a hypervascular tumor expressing several angiogenic factors. The correlation between plasma levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and the survival of patients with HCC was demonstrated earlier. However, a relationship between the expression of VEGF and vascular density in the HCC and non-malignant hepatic parenchyma has not been investigated.\nWe studied the expression of VEGF and vascular density in normal hepatic parenchyma, cirrhosis and HCC using a computer-based analysis of immunohistochemical stainings and confirmed it by Western Blot.\nThe vascular density in the areas of HCC and internodular fibrotic tissue in cirrhotic liver was significantly higher (185%; 146% respectively) than in non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma. Additionally, cirrhotic nodules were characterized by significantly lower vascularization (71%) compared with normal liver. There was a strong correlation between the levels of VEGF expression in tissue and the number of vessels (r=0.98, R2=0.9696).\nCirrhosis and HCC are characterized by different degrees of vascularization, which has been quantitated by a novel computer-based analysis of immunohistochemical stainings. One of the major stimuli for angiogenesis in these liver diseases could be VEGF, as the VEGF expression was higher in HCC and diminished in cirrhotic nodules, thus strongly correlating with the degree of vascularization.

{"title": "Redox regulation of the VEGF signaling path and tissue vascularization: Hydrogen peroxide, the common link between physical exercise and cutaneous wound healing.", "abstract": "Vascularization, under physiological or pathophysiological conditions, typically takes place by one or more of the following processes: angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, arteriogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Although all of these mechanisms of vascularization have sufficient contrasting features to warrant consideration under separate cover, one common feature shared by all is their sensitivity to the VEGF signaling pathway. Conditions such as wound healing and physical exercise result in increased production of reactive oxygen species such as H(2)O(2), and both are associated with increased tissue vascularization. Understanding these two scenarios of adult tissue vascularization in tandem offers the potential to unlock the significance of redox regulation of the VEGF signaling pathway. Does H(2)O(2) support tissue vascularization? H(2)O(2) induces the expression of the most angiogenic form of VEGF, VEGF-A, by a HIF-independent and Sp1-dependent mechanism. Ligation of VEGF-A to VEGFR2 results in signal transduction leading to tissue vascularization. Such ligation generates H(2)O(2) via an NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. Disruption of VEGF-VEGFR2 ligation-dependent H(2)O(2) production or decomposition of such H(2)O(2) stalls VEGFR2 signaling. Numerous antioxidants exhibit antiangiogenic properties. Current evidence lends firm credence to the hypothesis that low-level endogenous H(2)O(2) supports vascular growth.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2008-01-15", "authors": ["SashwatiRoy", "SavitaKhanna", "Chandan KSen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.01.025"}

To measure their acoustic behaviour under circulating blood conditions, the TMP backscatter enhancement was further evaluated on a home-made flow phantom at different TMP doses (0.12-15.6 mg/ml) suspended in aqueous and blood media, and in nude mice (aorta and B16 grafted melanoma). Integrated backscatter (IB) was measured by spectral analysis of the Doppler signals recorded from an ultrasound system (Aplio) combined with a 12-MHz probe. Doppler phantom experiments revealed a maximal IB of 17+/-0.88 dB and 7.5+/-0.7 dB in aqueous and blood media, respectively. IB measured on mice aorta, in pulsed Doppler mode, confirmed a constant maximal value of 7.29+/-1.72 dB over the first minutes after injection of a 7.8 mg/ml TMP suspension. Following the injection, a 60% enhancement of intratumoral vascularization detection was observed in power Doppler mode. A preliminary histological study revealed inert presence of some TMP in lungs 8 and 16 days after injection. Doppler phantom experiments on whole blood allowed to anticipate the in vivo acoustic behaviour. Both protocols demonstrated TMP effectiveness in significantly increasing Doppler signal intensity and intratumoral vascularization detection.

This treatment also reduces retinal protein nitration, which is greater in diabetic rat retina than nondiabetic retina. As an approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy, we sought the identity of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in retina from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in a rat retinal M\u00fcller cell line grown in high glucose (25 mM). Anti-nitrotyrosine immunoprecipitation products from rat retina and M\u00fcller cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Ten nitrated proteins in diabetic rat retina and three nitrated proteins in M\u00fcller cells grown in high glucose were identified; three additional nitrotyrosine-containing proteins were tentatively identified from diabetic retina. The identified nitrotyrosine-containing proteins participate in a variety of processes including glucose metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription/translation. Among the nitrated proteins were insulin-responsive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4), which has been implicated previously in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus; exocyst complex component Exo70, which functions in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake of GLUT-4-containing vesicles; and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, which influences retinal vascularization via fibroblast growth factor signaling. Nitration of tyrosine phosphorylation sites were identified in five proteins, including GLUT-4, exocyst complex component Exo70, protein-tyrosine phosphatase eta, sensory neuron synuclein, and inositol trisphosphate receptor 3. Quantitation of nitration and phosphorylation at common tyrosine modification sites in GLUT-4 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase eta from diabetic and nondiabetic animals suggests that nitration reduced tyrosine phosphorylation approximately 2X in these proteins from diabetic retina.

HIF-1 is among the primary genes involved in the homeostatic process, which can increase vascularization in hypoxic areas such as localized ischemia and tumors. It is a transcription factor for dozens of target genes; HIF-1 is also essential for immunological responses and is a crucial physiological regulator of homeostasis, vascularization, and anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, HIF-1 is increasingly studied because of its perceived therapeutic potential. As it causes angiogenesis, enhancement of this gene within ischemic patients could promote the vessel proliferation needed for oxygenation. In contrast, as HIF-1 allows for survival and proliferation of cancerous cells due to its angiogenic properties, inhibition potentially could prevent the spread of cancer. With a growing understanding of the HIF-1 pathway, the inhibition and stimulation of its transcriptional activity via small molecules is now an attractive goal.

{"title": "Microsurgical reconstruction of posttraumatic high-energy maxillary defects: establishing the effectiveness of early reconstruction.", "abstract": "Posttraumatic, high-energy defects of the midface can be challenging to reconstruct because they involve extensive composite tissue loss and result in significant permanent functional and cosmetic deformity. These injuries require replacement of the bony framework, external soft tissue, and intraoral mucosa. Local skin flaps and nonvascularized bone grafts have been used for reconstruction, but bony resorption and the associated soft-tissue collapse limit long-term viability. The authors present a classification of maxillary defects following high-energy trauma and a treatment algorithm using vascularized bone flaps.\nFourteen patients with significant maxillary loss from high-energy trauma underwent reconstruction with composite vascularized bone flaps. Eight patients had fibula flaps and six had iliac crest flaps. There were five women and nine men, with a mean age of 36.3 years (range, 21 to 48 years) and a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 5 to 54 months).\nThirteen of the 14 flaps survived. Nine patients had additional procedures. Nine patients had oronasal fistulas and eight were dependent on gastrostomy tubes preoperatively. All patients were able to feed orally without nasal regurgitation postoperatively. All patients achieved stable restoration of the midfacial architecture.\nThe classification scheme presented centers on the missing maxillary subunits.

We compared the properties of alloantigen (Ag)-pulsed, rapamycin (Rapa)-conditioned and control bone marrow-derived host myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and their potential, together with transient immunosuppression (anti-lymphocyte serum+cyclosporine), to promote long-term, vascularized skin graft survival in Lewis rats across a full MHC barrier. Both types of DCs expressed low levels of CD86, but Rapa DC expressed lower levels of MHC II and CD40 and were less stimulatory in MLR. While both Rapa and control DCs produced low levels of IL-12p70 and moderate levels of IL-6 and IL-10 following TLR ligation, Rapa DC secreted significantly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in response to LPS. Donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC, but not control DC, induced long-term skin graft survival (median survival time >133 days) when administered 7 and 14 days post-transplant. Circulating T cells in hosts with long-surviving grafts were hyporesponsive to donor alloAg stimulation, but proliferated in response to third-party stimulation and produced IFN-gamma and IL-10. When recipients of long-surviving grafts were challenged with skin grafts, donor but not third-party grafts were prolonged, suggesting underlying regulatory mechanisms. Both flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC infusion expanded CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in recipients' spleens, graft-associated lymph nodes and the graft. These data demonstrate for the first time that pharmacologically-modified, donor Ag-pulsed host DC administered post-transplant can promote indefinite vascularized skin graft survival, associated with Treg expansion.", "journal": "Transplant immunology", "date": "2007-12-26", "authors": ["Elaine KHoribe", "JustinSacks", "JigneshUnadkat", "GiorgioRaimondi", "ZhiliangWang", "RyosukeIkeguchi", "DouglasMarsteller", "Lydia MFerreira", "Angus WThomson", "W P AndrewLee", "MaryamFeili-Hariri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trim.2007.10.007"}

To this end, we recently created a variant of VEGF(121), TG-VEGF(121) that directly binds to fibrin and gets released locally in proteolysis-triggered manner. Here we combined noninvasive biophotonic monitoring of VEGF receptor 2 gene activation in transgenic VEGFR2-luc mice and histomorphometry to compare endothelial activation and long-term neovascularization by actively released TG-VEGF(121)versus passively released, diffusible wild-type VEGF(121) in subcutaneous fibrin implants. Monitoring in real-time over 3 weeks of luciferase signal driven by the VEGFR2 promoter revealed endothelial activation in skin exposed to wild-type VEGF(121), but no detectable elevation over fibrin alone by TG-VEGF(121). Histology at 3 weeks, however, demonstrated that TG-VEGF(121) promoted vessel growth significantly more effectively and reliably than wild-type VEGF(121). The majority of vessels surviving to 3 weeks contained stabilizing smooth muscle cells. Yet, by 6 weeks, no extra vessels induced by exogenous VEGF were left. In conclusion, release of fibrin-conjugated variant TG-VEGF(121) elicited lower VEGFR2-luc activation than wild-type VEGF(121) yet significantly more vascularization.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in bone fracture healing: a bioregulatory model.", "abstract": "The process of fracture healing involves the action and interaction of many cells, regulated by biochemical and mechanical signals. Vital to a successful healing process is the restoration of a good vascular network. In this paper, a continuous mathematical model is presented that describes the different fracture healing stages and their response to biochemical stimuli only (a bioregulatory model); mechanoregulatory effects are excluded here. The model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations and densities of the cell types, extracellular matrix types and growth factors indispensable to the healing process. The model starts after the inflammation phase, when the fracture callus has already been formed. Cell migration is described using not only haptokinetic, but also chemotactic and haptotactic influences. Cell differentiation is controlled by the presence of growth factors and sufficient vascularisation. Matrix synthesis and growth factor production are controlled by the local cell and matrix densities and by the local growth factor concentrations. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data obtained from literature, are presented. The simulation results are corroborated by comparison with experimental data from a standardised rodent fracture model. The results of sensitivity analyses on the parameter values as well as on the boundary and initial conditions are discussed. Numerical simulations of compromised healing situations showed that the establishment of a vascular network in response to angiogenic growth factors is a key factor in the healing process. Furthermore, a correct description of cell migration is also shown to be essential to the prediction of realistic spatiotemporal tissue distribution patterns in the fracture callus. The mathematical framework presented in this paper can be an important tool in furthering the understanding of the mechanisms causing compromised healing and can be applied in the design of future fracture healing experiments.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2007-12-25", "authors": ["LiesbetGeris", "AlfGerisch", "Jos VanderSloten", "R\u00fcdigerWeiner", "Hans VanOosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.11.008"}

{"title": "Inorganic materials for bone repair or replacement applications.", "abstract": "In recent years, excipient systems have been used increasingly in biomedicine in reconstructive and replacement surgery, as bone cements, drug-delivery vehicles and contrast agents. Particularly, interest has been growing in the development and application of controlled pore inorganic ceramic materials for use in bone-replacement and bone-repair roles and, in this context, attention has been focused on calcium-phosphate, bioactive glasses and SiO2- and TiO2-based materials. It has been shown that inorganic materials that most closely mimic bone structure and surface chemistry most closely function best in bone replacement/repair and, in particular, if a substance possesses a macroporous structure (pores and interconnections >100 microm diameter), then cell infiltration, bone growth and vascularization can all be promoted. The surface roughness and micro/mesoporosity of a material have also been observed to significantly influence its ability to promote apatite nucleation and cell attachment significantly. Pores (where present) can also be packed with pharmaceuticals and biomolecules (e.g., bone morphogenetic proteins [BMPs], which can stimulate bone formation). Finally, the most bio-efficient - in terms of collagen formation and apatite nucleation - materials are those that are able to provide soluble mineralizing species (Si, Ca, PO(4)) at their implant sites and/or are doped or have been surface-activated with specific functional groups. This article presents the context and latest advances in the field of bone-repair materials, especially with respect to the development of bioactive glasses and micro/mesoporous and macroporous inorganic scaffolds.

Although the molecular triggers which allow vascular ingrowth in the aforementioned avascular regions are not well understood, they may represent potential prophylactic or therapeutic targets. Thus, an investigation was conducted to determine whether the expression of chondromodulin-1 (Chm-1), an anti-angiogenic protein, is dysregulated in mitral valves in a rabbit model of IE, and whether Chm-1 transcripts are differentially expressed in various heart tissues.\nFive groups of animals (seven per group) were studied: group I was untreated controls; group II received (intravenously) 6x10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus; group III underwent mitral valve surgery; and groups IV and V underwent surgery and received S. aureus (as per group II), with tissues sampled at 6 and 12 h after surgery, respectively). Mitral valve surgery was performed by sewing a Dacron patch onto the valve, thereby creating a lesion and causing valve insufficiency. Explanted hearts were dissected and Chm-1 expression was determined using both conventional and real-time RT-PCR.\nChm-1 transcripts were found in all cardiac regions, with strong expression in the heart valves, aorta, and pulmonary artery, and lowest expression in the ventricles. Both RT-PCR methods led to similar results; however, the down-regulation of Chm-1 expression in groups III, IV and V compared to controls was more pronounced in the real-time RT-PCR experiments (89 +/- 28% versus 40 +/- 28%; 63 +/- 22% versus 29 +/- 19%; and 51 +/- 11% versus 13 +/- 7.4%; Chm-1/GAPDH ratio levels relative to the control group in conventional versus real-time RT-PCRs in groups III, IV and V, respectively). Only the decrease in group V was significantly different from group I with both methods (p < 0.05 and p = 0.001). Bacteremia alone resulted only in minor changes compared to controls.\nIt is concluded that valvular Chm-1 expression is down-regulated in the early phase of IE, which is likely to promote leaflet vascularization and progression of the disease.", "journal": "The Journal of heart valve disease", "date": "2007-12-22", "authors": ["Joachim BGrammer", "Walter BEichinger", "SabineBleiziffer", "Matthias RBenz", "R\u00fcdigerLange", "RobertBauernschmitt"], "doi": null}

The approval of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) for use in colorectal and lung cancer provides clinical validation for targeting angiogenesis for the treatment of cancer. Delta-like 4 (Dll4)-mediated Notch signaling represents another key pathway essential for vascular development. Recent studies yield substantial insights into the role of Dll4 in angiogenesis. Dll4 is downstream of VEGF signaling and its activation triggers a negative feedback that restrains the effects of VEGF. Attenuation of Dll4/Notch signaling results in chaotic vascular network with excessive branching and sprouting. In preclinical studies, blocking of Dll4/Notch signaling is associated with a paradoxical increase in tumor vessel density, yet causes marked growth inhibition due to functionally defective vasculature.

Here, a stepwise, in vitro method of engineering rat kidney-like tissue capable of being implanted is described. Based on the fact that the stages of kidney development are separable into in vitro modules, an approach was devised that sequentially induces an epithelial tubule (the Wolffian duct) to undergo in vitro budding, followed by branching of a single isolated bud and its recombination with metanephric mesenchyme. Implantation of the recombined tissue results in apparent early vascularization. Thus, in principle, an unbranched epithelial tubular structure (potentially constructed from cultured cells) can be induced to form kidney tissue such that this in vitro engineered tissue is capable of being implanted in host rats and developing glomeruli with evidence of early vascularization. Optimization studies (of growth factor and matrix) indicate multiple suitable combinations and suggest both a most robust and a minimal system. A whole-genome microarray analysis suggested that recombined tissue recapitulated gene expression changes that occur in vivo during later stages of kidney development, and a functional assay demonstrated that the recombined tissue was capable of transport characteristic of the differentiating nephron.

All patients were seen in our department again. A database was created which included the following parameters: date and exact area of implantation, shape and thickness of the implant, number of revisions, technique of prior rhinoplasties, complications and the patients' satisfaction.\nSeventy-five percent of patients were revision rhinoplasties at the time of surgery. Seven out of thirty two (21%) patients developed a complication. In four cases, the complication was managed with total explantation; three patient's condition required partial explantation. The shortest implantation period was only 24 days and the longest lasting implant within the complication group was explanted 266 days after implantation. All these patients had undergone multiple rhinoplasties before, with heavy scar tissue and septal perforations. The most frequent complication (n = 4) was a partially extruded implant without any signs of infection in the area of the anterior septum.\nOur descriptive study shows limitations in the use of PE for rhinoplasty. It seems crucial that the implant is completely covered with vital tissue, otherwise vascularization and healing is excluded. The implantation place should be vital and without any signs of infection. The covering tissue should not be too thin or scarred. An early infection of the open porous system prevents vascularization and healing and inevitably causes a rejection. The reason for the high complication rate (> 20%) in this study lies in the specifications of the selected patient group at hand. All implantations were performed in seriously damaged scar tissue after multiple revision rhinoplasties.

Squamous cell carcinoma xenografts grown in nude mice were scanned with HF-VPDU at a center frequency of 30 MHz. Images with 200-microm slice thicknesses were recorded and merged into a three-dimensional dataset, of which the relative color pixel density was determined. Animals received either VEGFR2 antibodies or 0.9% NaCl and were examined at days 0, 3 and 6 of treatment. After the last examination, tumors were resected and their vascularization characterized by immunohistology. At day 6, the volumes of treated and untreated tumors were not significantly different yet. In contrast, mean tumor vascularization in treated animals had decreased to 44%, while in the control group it had increased to 152% (P < 0.01). In correspondence, vessel density, as determined by CD31 staining, was 0.19 +/- 0.10% in treated and 0.92 +/- 0.41% in untreated tumors (P < 0.01). Additionally, the fraction of mature (SMA-positive) vessels increased under therapy. Thus, HF-VPDU can be considered as an easily applicable and fast method to screen high animal numbers for antiangiogenic therapy effects.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2007-12-18", "authors": ["ManfredJugold", "MoritzPalmowski", "JochenHuppert", "Eva CWoenne", "Margareta MMueller", "WolfhardSemmler", "FabianKiessling"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-007-0825-5"}

SW620CE2 human colon cancer cells growing in culture and orthotopically in the cecum of nude mice expressed a high level of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but were negative for EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and VEGFR. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that tumor-associated endothelial cells expressed EGFR, VEGFR2, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), and phosphorylated VEGFR (pVEGFR). Treatment of mice with either 7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]-pyrimidine lead scaffold (AEE788; an inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR tyrosine kinase) or CPT-11 as single agents significantly inhibited the growth of cecal tumors (P < .01); this decrease was even more pronounced with AEE788 combined with CPT-11 (P < .001). AEE788 alone or combined with CPT-11 also inhibited the expression of pEGFR and pVEGFR on tumor-associated endothelial cells, significantly decreased vascularization and tumor cell proliferation, and increased the level of apoptosis in both tumor-associated endothelial cells and tumor cells. These data demonstrate that targeting EGFR and VEGFR signaling on tumor-associated endothelial cells provides a viable approach for the treatment of colon cancer.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2007-12-18", "authors": ["TakamitsuSasaki", "YasuhikoKitadai", "ToruNakamura", "Jang-SeongKim", "Rachel ZTsan", "ToshioKuwai", "Robert RLangley", "DominicFan", "Sun-JinKim", "Isaiah JFidler"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.07667"}
{"title": "Neuroprotective role of neurophysiological monitoring during endovascular procedures in the brain and spinal cord.", "abstract": "The goal of endovascular neurosurgery is to occlude aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or to reduce the vascular supply to hypervascularized tumors, while preserving function in the normal neural tissue. However, the intra-arterial injection of embolizing materials into the cerebral or spinal circulation exposes to the risk of ischemic complications. Under general anesthesia, unless a wake-up test is performed, the only way to assess the functional integrity of sensory and motor pathways is to use neurophysiological monitoring. Somatosensory (SEPs) and muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs) can be used in combination with pharmacological provocative tests (PTs) to predict the effects of embolization. Amytal blocks neuronal activity, while lidocaine blocks axonal conduction. Therefore, a positive Amytal or lidocaine test (i.e. more than 50% decrease in SEP amplitude and/or mMEP disappearance) indicates that the vessel distal to the tip of the microcatheter supplies the functional gray or white matter of the spinal-cord respectively and cannot be embolized. Brain and spinal-cord vascularization and hemodynamics are extremely complex and even more unpredictable in the presence of a vascular malformation, but using a combined SEPs, MEPs and PTs protocol, morbidity related to endovascular procedures is very low. Given the high sensitivity of peripheral recordings to spinal-cord ischemia, experimental and clinical studies support the concept that whenever the mechanism of spinal-cord injury is purely ischemic, recording mMEPs may suffice. Reports on the use of PTs and neurophysiological monitoring during embolization of brain AVMs in critical areas are more anecdotal and mainly limited to the use of short-acting barbiturates. Our preliminary experience using lidocaine and combining SEP and mMEP monitoring is encouraging, since no false negative results were observed. Finally, if the sensitivity of this method is very high, its specificity has not been tested because embolization is abandoned whenever PTs are consistently positive. Accordingly, the possibility of false positive results cannot be excluded.", "journal": "Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "date": "2007-12-18", "authors": ["FSala", "ABeltramello", "MGerosa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neucli.2007.10.004"}

The current review summarizes existing knowledge of the mechanisms of angiogenesis in melanoma, as well as current anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies and their targets. We focus primarily on the role of key growth factors that are secreted by melanoma cells and known to trigger angiogenic responses, and their receptors as expressed on both endothelial and melanoma cells. Many of these growth factors function in synergy with receptors for extracellular matrix, integrins, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). All of these systems of molecules are activated during major stages of angiogenesis such as endothelial migration, proliferation, and reorganization of surrounding extracellular matrix. The blockade of these molecules and their downstream pathways leads to inhibition of melanoma vascularization. Thus, these classes of molecules are essential for melanoma angiogenesis and, therefore, might serve as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

The dialysis process involves osmosis, as well as diffusive and convective transports through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. Computer simulations predicted that the membrane contains ultrasmall pores responsible for the selective transport of water across the capillary endothelium during crystalloid osmosis. The distribution of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1), as well as its molecular structure ensuring an exquisite selectivity for water, fit with the characteristics of the ultrasmall pore. Peritoneal transport studies using AQP1 knockout mice demonstrated that the osmotic water flux across the peritoneal membrane is mediated by AQP1. This water transport accounts for 50% of the ultrafiltration during PD. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids upregulates the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries, resulting in increased water transport and ultrafiltration in rats. AQP1 may also play a role during inflammation, as vascular proliferation and leukocyte recruitment are both decreased in mice lacking AQP1. These data illustrate the potential of the peritoneal membrane as an experimental model in the investigation of the role of AQP1 in the endothelium at baseline and during inflammation. They emphasize the critical role of AQP1 during PD and suggest that manipulating AQP1 expression could be clinically useful in PD patients.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2007-12-15", "authors": ["TomoyaNishino", "OlivierDevuyst"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-007-0402-4"}

{"title": "Mutation of the HEXIM1 gene results in defects during heart and vascular development partly through downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "Our previous studies and those of others indicated that the transcription factor Hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) is a tumor suppressor and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and that these HEXIM1 functions are mainly dependent on its C-terminal region. We provide evidence here that the HEXIM1 C-terminal region is critical for cardiovascular development. HEXIM1 protein was detected in the heart during critical time periods in cardiac growth and chamber maturation. We created mice carrying an insertional mutation in the HEXIM1 gene that disrupted its C-terminal region and found that this resulted in prenatal lethality. Heart defects in HEXIM1(1 to 312) mice included abnormal coronary patterning and thin ventricular walls. The thin myocardium can be partly attributed to increased apoptosis. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecular precursor-1 staining of HEXIM1(1 to 312) heart sections revealed decreased vascularization of the myocardium despite the presence of coronary vasculature in the epicardium. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), known to affect angioblast invasion and myocardial proliferation and survival, was decreased in HEXIM1(1 to 312) mice compared with control littermates. We also observed decreased fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) expression, suggesting that effects of HEXIM1 in the myocardium are partly mediated through epicardial FGF9 signaling. Together our results suggest that HEXIM1 plays critical roles in coronary vessel development and myocardial growth. The basis for this role of HEXIM1 is that VEGF is a direct transcriptional target of HEXIM1, and involves attenuation a repressive effects of C/EBPalpha on VEGF gene transcription.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2007-12-15", "authors": ["Monica MMontano", "Yong QuiDoughman", "HuayunDeng", "LauraChaplin", "JianqiYang", "NancyWang", "QiangZhou", "Nicole LWard", "MichikoWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.157859"}

The aim of this paper is to assess, by means of MCNPX simulations, the doses delivered around and throughout a solid tumor when the radioactive atom linked to each antibody is replaced by a 5 nm diameter nanoparticle composed of numerous radionuclides. A new model for a spherical vascularized tumor has been developed in which the antibody distributions inside the tumor can be uniform or heterogeneous. It is also possible to simulate a central necrotic core inside the tumor where the concentration of radiolabeled antibodies is assumed to be zero. Dosimetry calculations have been performed for the beta-emitting radionuclide (90)Y2O3. Preliminary results show that the irregularity of vasculature and the presence of a necrotic core have a noticeable influence on the deposited dose profiles. Moreover, with a total activity of 5 and 34 MBq for tumor radii of 0.5 and 1.0 cm, respectively, viable tumor cells can receive doses of up to 50 Gy, even if high nonuniformity of the total activity is observed in the tumor.

{"title": "In vitro utilization of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in hemodialysis therapy.", "abstract": "The in vitro utilization of biocompatible ferromagnetic nanoparticles (BFNs) in hemodialysis (HD), routinely used today for the treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD), is introduced in this work. The proposed strategy is termed magnetically assisted hemodialysis (MAHD) and it aims to become a more efficient development of conventional HD. The method is based on the production of biocompatible ferromagnetic nanoparticles-targeted binding substances conjugates (BFNs-TBSs Cs) constructed of BFNs and specifically designed TBSs that should have high affinity and binding capacity for target toxic substances (TTSs) which must be removed from the ESRD patient subjected to HD. Antibodies or even specific proteins could serve as the TBS of the desired BFNs-TBSs Cs. The BFNs-TBSs Cs should be administered to the patient timely prior to the MAHD session so as to bind with the desired TTSs during their free circulation in the vascular network. Eventually, the complete BFNs-TBSs-TTSs structure can be selectively removed during the MAHD session by means of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field that is applied either at the dialyzer or at other collection point(s) along the blood circulation line of the dialysis machine. The advantages of MAHD over conventional HD regarding the patient's comfort and overall health status are discussed in detail among practical issues. To examine this proposition we employed Fe(3)O(4) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the BFN and the TBS constituents respectively, since they are both highly biocompatible. By means of x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, UV-vis spectrophotometry, SQUID magnetometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance we evaluated (i) the structural/morphological characteristics, (ii) the magnetic retraction efficiency, and most importantly (iii) the toxin binding affinity and capacity of both bare Fe(3)O(4) BFNs and Fe(3)O(4)-BSA Cs by performing in vitro experiments on specific TTSs.

{"title": "[Reconstruction of long bone defects with a vascularized fibular graft after tumor resection in children and adolescents: thirteen cases with 50-month follow-up].", "abstract": "The vascularized fibular graft is a widely used technique for the reconstruction of long bone defects after tumor resection. Complications are not uncommon despite the presence of a good vascular supply. We report our experience with long bone reconstructions in children and adolescents after resection of primary malignant bone tumors.\nThis retrospective analysis included thirteen patients aged 4-17 years (mean age 12 years). Preoperatively, the pathological diagnosis was Ewing tumor (n=7), osteogenic sarcoma (n=5), neuroepithelioma (n=1). All patients except one were given chemotherapy preoperatively and postoperatively and four received adjuvant radiotherapy. Tumor resection created a gap (n=8) or involved resection-arthrodesis (n=5, three knees, one ankle, one elbow). All reconstructions used a vascularized fibular flap with a complementary corticocancellous autograft for seven.\nComplete carcinological resection was achieved in all cases. Mean follow-up was 50 months (range 12-144 months). There were no cases of local recurrence. Three patients presented lung metastasis; two patients died. Eleven of the twelve patients who underwent tumor resection involving the lower limb were able to walk with full weight bearing at 13.9 months (range 841 months), half of them without any supportive device. The MSTS score was 21/30 (range 7-29). Both ends healed for eleven of thirteen grafts. Outcome was good in four cases at 7.7 months (range 6-11), fair in seven (with 1-5 complementary procedures) at 14.8 months (range 10-45) and poor in two (nonunion at last follow-up). Among the fibular grafts which healed, primary healing of the distal end was noted in all cases, but not for the proximal end. Significant transplant hypertrophy was noted in 62% of patients, measured at mean 77.1% (range 25-128%). Complications were: skin necrosis (n=2), nonunion (n=4, three aseptic and one septic), disassembly (n=3 with two transplant fractures), and spontaneous fracture which healed (n=5, all but one treated orthopedically). There were four donor site complications: retraction of the hallux flexor (n=3), regressive paresia of the common fibular nerve (n=1).\nThe rate of healing in this series was similar to earlier reports. Healing was always achieved for the distal focus but not for the proximal focus which receives its blood supply from a branch of the anterior tibial artery which is not harvested. The defective blood supply can thus hinder bone healing. It is necessary to spare the proximal quarter of the fibula or harvest a bipediculated graft. The rate of graft hypertrophy was also similar, as was the rate of complications. The MSTS score was lower due to the poor results obtained with resection-arthrodesis of the knee joint. Graft fractures and aseptic nonunion are the most common complications but septic complications are more serious and can threaten graft survival. Complications at the donor site are exceptional.\nLong bone reconstruction using an autologous vascularized fibular graft is a reliable technique providing satisfactory functional results. Complications can be prevented by making solid fixation and using a corticocancellous graft creating a favorable osteoinducing environment. A massive allograft is another solution providing good immediate mechanical stability.", "journal": "Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur", "date": "2007-12-11", "authors": ["J-MLaffosse", "FAccadbled", "AAbid", "JKany", "PDarodes", "JSales De Gauzy"], "doi": "10.1016/s0035-1040(07)92677-x"}

Adults with BPD are at increased risk for respiratory difficulties including respiratory and lung function disorders. Respiratory symptoms include wheezing, cough and dyspnoea. In adult BPD patients lung function is impaired, notably by bronchus obstruction, hyperreactivity and reduced diffusion capacity; exercise capacity is also diminished. The pathophysiology of BPD is not identical to that of asthma and standard treatment for asthma is therefore not effective. Premature infants are currently treated with surfactant therapy that results in less intensive artificial respiration and oxygen being required. The classical BPD clinical picture that results from tissue damage and scarring is therefore becoming less common but another new BPD picture is emerging. This is characterised by large irregularly formed sacculi and alveoli with septation only just beginning and poor vascularization. Patients with chronic respiratory symptoms who were born prematurely should therefore undergo comprehensive testing, including detailed lung function tests and exhaled nitric oxide levels.", "journal": "Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "date": "2007-12-11", "authors": ["E J L EVrijlandt", "JGerritsen", "E JDuiverman"], "doi": null}
{"title": "alphaB-crystallin promotes tumor angiogenesis by increasing vascular survival during tube morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Selective targeting of endothelial cells in tumor vessels requires delineation of key molecular events in formation and survival of blood vessels within the tumor microenvironment. To this end, proteins transiently up-regulated during vessel morphogenesis were screened for their potential as targets in antiangiogenic tumor therapy. The molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin was identified as specifically induced with regard to expression level, modification by serine phosphorylation, and subcellular localization during tubular morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of alphaB-crystallin expression did not affect endothelial proliferation but led to attenuated tubular morphogenesis, early activation of proapoptotic caspase-3, and increased apoptosis. alphaB-crystallin was expressed in a subset of human tumor vessels but not in normal capillaries. Tumors grown in alphaB-crystallin(-/-) mice were significantly less vascularized than wild-type tumors and displayed increased areas of apoptosis/necrosis. Importantly, tumor vessels in alphaB-crystallin(-/-) mice were leaky and showed signs of caspase-3 activation and extensive apoptosis. Ultrastructural analyses showed defective vessels partially devoid of endothelial lining. These data strongly implicate alphaB-crystallin as an important regulator of tubular morphogenesis and survival of endothelial cell during tumor angiogenesis.

{"title": "Vascular sprout formation entails tissue deformations and VE-cadherin-dependent cell-autonomous motility.", "abstract": "Embryonic and fetal vascular sprouts form within constantly expanding tissues. Nevertheless, most biological assays of vascular spouting are conducted in a static mechanical milieu. Here we study embryonic mouse allantoides, which normally give raise to an umbilical artery and vein. However, when placed in culture, allantoides assemble a primary vascular network. Unlike other in vitro assays, allantoic primordial vascular cells are situated on the upper surface of a cellular layer that is engaged in robust spreading motion. Time-lapse imaging allows quantification of primordial vascular cell motility as well as the underlying mesothelial tissue motion. Specifically, we calculate endothelial cell-autonomous motion by subtracting the tissue-level mesothelial motion from the total endothelial cell displacements. Formation of new vascular polygons is hindered by administration of function-blocking VE-cadherin antibodies. Time-lapse recordings reveal that (1) cells at the base of sprouts normally move distally \"over\" existing sprout cells to form new tip-cells; and (2) loss of VE-cadherin activity prevents this motile behavior. Thus, endothelial cell-cell-adhesion-based motility is required for the advancement of vascular sprouts within a moving tissue environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that couples endogenous tissue dynamics to assembly of vascular networks in a mammalian system.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2007-12-08", "authors": ["Erica DPerryn", "Andr\u00e1sCzir\u00f3k", "Charles DLittle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.10.036"}

One graft per patient was selected, leaving 901 grafts for analysis.\nData were obtained from the Singapore Eye Bank's SCTS database. Cases were classified into optical, therapeutic, and tectonic indications and 9 corneal disease groups. Twenty-four demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and donor risk factors were subjected to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression modeling.\nGraft failure, defined as the irreversible loss of optical clarity.\nStudy patients were Asian, comprising Chinese (72.7%), Indian (11.54%), and Malay (11.1%) ethnicities (mean age, 56.65 years). The mean follow-up period was 36.8+/-35.5 months. Indications for surgery were optical (87.0%), therapeutic (8.1%), and tectonic (4.88%). Main diagnoses were pseudophakic/aphakic bullous keratopathy (23.4%), postinfectious scarring (12.9%), regrafts (12.4%), keratoconus (9.7%), and posttraumatic scarring (7.3%). Kaplan-Meier survival rates for optical grafts were 86.6%, 72.0%, 63.7%, and 52.0% at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively; survival rates for therapeutic grafts were 78.4%, 58.3%, and 37.3% at 1, 3, and 5 years, and those for tectonic grafts were 68.3% and 41.7% at 1 and 3 years.

This natural process called therapeutic angiogenesis has been tried in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease mainly. It has been seen as a chance of an effective beneficial therapy particularly in these patients for whom pharmacological treatment is not sufficient and who are disqualified for operative methods such as the percutaneous coronary angioplasty, or coronary bypass transplantation. The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is to stimulate the growth of new capillaries in a heart and, as a result, to improve the perfusion and function of a heart muscle. The positive impact of the angiogenesis in a heart muscle is impeded in patients using corticosteroids in treatment for other illnesses. Corticosteroids inhibit the angiogenesis process on a cellular and tissue level. They decrease gene expression for VEGF, iNOS, inhibit the activity of transcriptive factors for AP-1 and NF(k)B. Corticosteroids cause the degradation of a pericellular matrix, inhibit the migration of macrophages and inhibit the synthesis of NO and interleukin.

The hindgut is highly modified, being well vascularized with intraepithelial capillaries, which makes it well suited for gas exchange. However, the consequences for nutrient uptake, the traditional function of the intestine are unknown. The alimentary canal was examined histologically to assess differences between the fore-, mid- and hindgut regions that have been considered as the digestive, spiral and respiratory zones, respectively. In order to characterise the potential digestive (absorptive) function of the respiratory zone we used semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the intestinal Na(+):glucose cotransporter (SGLT1; SLC5A1) and H(+):peptide cotransporter (PEPT1a; SLC15A1) and partially sequenced the SGLT1 and PEPT1a cDNAs. These two transporters play important roles in the absorption of carbohydrate and di-/tripeptides, respectively, in the gut of fishes and other vertebrates and were therefore used as markers for potential nutrient uptake function. We also determined their tissue distributions through semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The effects of diet composition (high protein or high carbohydrate) or fasting on gene expression were also examined. SGLT1 expression was found in kidney, liver, heart, as well as in the three zones of the gut except the most distal part of the hindgut. PEPT1a mRNA was found in heart, brain, liver, and fore- and midgut, but absent in the hindgut. Our results clearly show high expression of SGLT1 (both mRNA and protein by immunolocalization) and PEPT1a (mRNA) in the foregut and midgut correlated with the digestive region of the gut. Modulatory effects of diet on the gene expression for both SGLT1 and PEPT1a were not observed. The presence of SGLT1 transcripts in the respiratory zone of the intestine suggests an overlap in function. However, in the case of PEPT1a, the distal limit was the midgut.

Since that time, 18 pectoralis major muscle extended island flaps have been successfully used, with only a single wound complication still requiring use of a rectus abdominis muscle flap.

{"title": "Connecting a tumor to the environment.", "abstract": "Tumor cells are not only susceptible to signals from the environment, but they likewise release signal substances. It is well known that tumor cells secrete angiogenic factors--most prominently the vascular endothelial growth factor--which initiate the vascularization of the tumor for its nourishment. This process has been termed neoangiogenesis. Besides this, two further processes have recently been discovered that facilitate the interaction of the tumor with the lymphatic system and the nervous system, named lymphangiogenesis and neoneurogenesis. These three \"geneses\" have a cognate, in part common regulation and conjointly promote metastasis development. Neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis provide the structures for the two routes of tumor cell dissemination, i.e. either hematogenous or lymphatic. Neoneurogenesis accomplishes the innervation of the tumor by the ingrowth of nerve endings into the tumor and alternatively or additionally by the protection of existing nerve cells from destruction. These tumor-innervating nerve cells may release neurotransmitters which are proliferative or promigratory signals for the tumor cells. Furthermore, nerve fibers are used as routes for tumor cell dissemination, too, which is known as perineural invasion.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2007-11-30", "authors": ["FrankEntschladen", "DanielPalm", "Theodore LDrell", "KerstinLang", "Kurt SZaenker"], "doi": null}

One to 2 weeks post injection, vitreal oxygen concentration was measured using a highly sensitive, platinum-based fluorophore O2 sensor. In addition, control and microplasmin-injected rats, guinea pigs, and cats were exposed to 100% oxygen and vitreal O2 levels were measured over time. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the vitreoretinal interface for the presence of a PVD.\nIn animals with a vascularized retinal circulation (brown Norway rats and cats), intravitreal injection of microplasmin with induction of a PVD significantly increased baseline O2 concentration in the vitreous cavity compared to hyaluronidase injected eyes and controls in rats (35, 25, and 23 mm Hg, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) and cats (26, 18, and 16 mm Hg, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively).

However, in 5 to 10 percent of lower limbs, these perforators are absent. This anatomical study evaluated use of the soleus musculocutaneous perforator for skin paddle salvage in such situations.\nLatex injection studies were performed on 20 cadaveric lower limbs. The presence, prevalence, and location of the musculocutaneous perforators in the distal leg were documented. The perforators were traced proximally to determine their origins.\nOf the 20 cadaveric limbs, one or more musculocutaneous perforators of at least 0.5 mm in diameter were noted in 18 specimens (90 percent). They were located within 6 cm of the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the fibula. The soleus musculocutaneous perforators originated in the peroneal artery in 10 specimens (50 percent), the posterior tibial artery in seven (35 percent), and the tibioperoneal trunk in one (5 percent). This information was successfully used to salvage the skin paddle in two of our clinical cases.\nUse of the soleus musculocutaneous perforator depends on its origin. When it arises from the peroneal artery, a single set of anastomoses is all that is necessary for flap revascularization, with the skin paddle serving as a monitor for the bone flap.

The ideal material for coverage of defects created by neck contracture release is thin, supple, large, well-vascularized, healthy tissue. The thoracodorsal artery perforator flap, a workhorse flap for reconstruction, allows a large dimension and free thickness control with low donor-site morbidity. The value of a free thin thoracodorsal artery perforator flap for anterior neck burn deformities has not been evaluated in a substantial series.\nFour men and eight women underwent neck reconstruction from December of 2002 to August of 2004. Mean patient age was 34.3 years (range, 21 to 47 years). Thorough burn scar contracture releases were performed and cervicoplasty was added for optimal neck appearance. Uniformly thin thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps were made. Both lateral ends of these flaps were designed with a fishtail shape for sufficient release and to minimize linear scar band formation in the most lateral region of the neck.\nElevated flaps as large as 24 x 12 cm and with a mean thickness 5.3 mm were used. All flaps survived without significant complications. Range of neck motion increased, and the cervicomandibular angle was sharpened in all patients. A highly natural neck contour was universally obtained without a secondary debulking procedure.\nThe free thin thoracodorsal artery perforator flap with cervicoplasty provides good functional and aesthetic results in terms of neck contour and cervicomental angle, with a reduced necessity for secondary procedures and low donor-site morbidity.

This experimental animal study provides a novel theory on the problem of primary defatting, \"steal of perfusion\" to the skin by fat. This theory is based on the fact that the fat brings blood supply to the proximal flap portion but blood is sequestered in the fat of the distal flap portion, to the disadvantage of skin perfusion.\nFifteen full-thickness random-pattern skin flaps, with a 3:1 length-to-width ratio, elevated on the necks of pigs and then left in situ on a plastic sheet interposed between the flap and the deep vascularization from the muscle, were compared with 15 identical contralateral flaps, defatted in the distal half.\nIn the 15 nondefatted flaps, necrosis of the distal half of the flap was observed. Among the 15 defatted flaps, no necrosis was observed in four defatted flaps, partial necrosis was seen in five defatted flaps, concentric necrosis in three defatted flaps, partial necrosis in two defatted flaps, and necrosis in one defatted flap. Necrosis in defatted flaps was significantly less than that in nondefatted flaps (25.6 +/- 21.8 percent of flap surface versus 50 +/- 2.7 percent; p < 0.001).\nThere is a benefit to primary defatting. Perfusion steal exists for pedicular and peripheral vascularization. Primary partial defatting of a random-pattern flap is beneficial for distal perfusion, which is attributed to suppression of perfusion steal. Complete defatting is detrimental to flap survival.

Neovascularization was studied in C57Bl/6 mice reconstituted with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic bone marrow. Sprouting angiogenesis, detected using nuclear incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in endothelial cells was present in both models, whereas vascular incorporation of EGFP(+) BMDECs was restricted to HLI. In HLI, the presence of a pro-angiogenic molecular microenvironment comprising vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 2, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor corroborated the importance of these factors for vascular BMDEC incorporation, whereas this microenvironment was absent in FBR. Enhanced mobilization of BMDECs by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor administration or by combining HLI and FBR with Dacron did not induce incorporation of BMDECs in FBR neovessels.

Although non-unions are rare, their treatment has not been well defined yet. This report describes the arterial supply of the clavicle to clarify the pathological mechanism and the surgical procedure of non-unions. This study was based on delineation of the thoraco-acromial and suprascapular arteries with colored latex on 17 specimens (ten cadavers). Observations were made after macroscopic dissection and maceration. The main blood supply to the middle third of the clavicle was the periosteal. This supply came from the two branches of the thoraco-acromial trunk that penetrated the pectoralis major muscle and the deltoid muscle. In 13 cases, these two periosteal branches were anastomosed between these two muscle attachments. Periosteal vascularization was always seen on the superior surface and the anterior border of the bone, but never on the inferior surface or the posterior border. The suprascapular artery contributed to supply the middle third of the clavicle by several periosteal branches and also by an independent branch. This branch was born proximally near the internal, middle thirds union and passed along the posterior face of the subclavius muscle and pierced the bone through the nutria foramina located near the external, middle thirds union. Nevertheless, intraosseous arteries were noted only in four cases. In these cases, they were never more than 2cm long. Our results showed that the periosteal blood supply located between the muscles insertions and the arterial supply from the suprascapular artery could be twice compromised in case of important displacement or severe fracture.

{"title": "The mast cell and allergic diseases: role in pathogenesis and implications for therapy.", "abstract": "Mast cells have long been recognized for their role in the genesis of allergic inflammation; and more recently for their participation in innate and acquired immune responses. Mast cells reside within tissues including the skin and mucosal membranes, which interface with the external environment; as well as being found within vascularized tissues next to nerves, blood vessels and glandular structures. Mast cells have the capability of reacting both within minutes and over hours to specific stimuli, with local and systemic effects. Mast cells express the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) and upon aggregation of FcepsilonRI by allergen-specific IgE, mast cells release and generate biologically active preformed and newly synthesized mediators which are involved in many aspects of allergic inflammation. While mast cells have been well documented to be essential for acute allergic reactions, more recently the importance of mast cells in reacting through pattern recognition receptors in innate immune responses has become recognized. Moreover, as our molecular understanding of the mast cell has evolved, novel targets for modulation have been identified with promising therapeutic potential.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "date": "2007-11-23", "authors": ["J MBrown", "T MWilson", "D DMetcalfe"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02886.x"}
{"title": "PEGylated DX-1000: pharmacokinetics and antineoplastic activity of a specific plasmin inhibitor.", "abstract": "Novel inhibitors of the urokinase-mediated plasminogen (plg) activation system are potentially of great clinical benefit as anticancer treatments. Using phage display, we identified DX-1000 a tissue factor pathway inhibitor-derived Kunitz domain protein which is a specific high-affinity inhibitor of plasmin (pln) (K(i) = 99 pM). When tested in vitro, DX-1000 blocks plasmin-mediated pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9) activation on cells and dose-dependently inhibits tube formation, while not significantly affecting hemostasis and coagulation. However, this low-molecular weight protein inhibitor ( approximately 7 kDa) exhibits rapid plasma clearance in mice and rabbits, limiting its potential clinical use in chronic diseases. After site-specific PEGylation, DX-1000 retains its activity and exhibits a decreased plasma clearance. This PEGylated derivative is effective in vitro, as well as potent in inhibiting tumor growth of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells. 4PEG-DX-1000 treatment causes a significant reduction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen expressions, a reduction of tumor proliferation, and vascularization. 4PEG-DX-1000 treatment significantly decreases the level of active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the primary tumors and reduces metastasis incidence. Together, our results demonstrate the potential value of plasmin inhibitors as therapeutic agents for blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2007-11-22", "authors": ["LaetitiaDevy", "Shafaat ARabbani", "MarkStochl", "MaryRuskowski", "IanMackie", "LaurentNaa", "MarkToews", "Reinoudvan Gool", "JieChen", "ArtLey", "Robert CLadner", "Daniel TDransfield", "PaulaHenderikx"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.07544"}

However, future optimization of NET imaging may be achieved with positron emission tomography based methods utilizing more sensitive and specific tracers in combination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Here we established an orthotopic mouse model that reflects relevant aspects of human pancreatic NETs such as SSTR expression, dense vascularization and metastatic disease. This model was then utilized to test the feasibility of combined magnetic resonance imaging and animal positron emission tomography. Orthotopic implantation of amphicrine, SSTR-positive pancreatic AR42J cells resulted in rapidly growing tumors, with concomitant metastatic spread into abdominal lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity. Primary tumors as well as their metastases expressed the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin. For imaging experiments, the SSTR ligands (68)Ga-DOTATOC or (68)Ga-DOTANOC were injected intravenously, and animals were subsequently examined in an animal positron emission tomography scanner and a clinical 3T (tesla) magnetic resonance imager. All animals showed radionuclide accumulation in the primary tumor. Definite anatomical correlation was achieved using digital image fusion of the positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data. (68)Ga-DOTANOC strongly accumulated in the tumor tissue (mean 6.6-fold vs. control tissues) when compared to (68)Ga-DOTATOC, which showed a higher renal clearance. In good agreement with the biodistribution data, the kidney-to-tumor ratio was higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC (2.43-fold vs. 1.75-fold). Consequently, (68)Ga-DOTANOC achieved better signal enhancement in the primary tumor and allowed for detection of metastatic lesions. In summary, we established a novel orthotopic pancreatic SSTR-positive tumor model and used this model to provide proof of principle for the diagnostic combination of SSTR-based molecular imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, the animal model allowed the comparative evaluation of (68)Ga-DOTANOC and (68)Ga-DOTATOC, with (68)Ga-DOTANOC providing better tumor-specific accumulation and renal activity.

{"title": "Blocking heat shock protein-90 inhibits the invasive properties and hepatic growth of human colon cancer cells and improves the efficacy of oxaliplatin in p53-deficient colon cancer tumors in vivo.", "abstract": "We recently showed that inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis in gastric cancer through interference with oncogenic signaling pathways. However, controversy still exists about the antimetastatic potential of Hsp90 inhibitors. Moreover, in vitro studies suggested that blocking Hsp90 could overcome p53-mediated resistance of cancer cells to oxaliplatin. We therefore hypothesized that blocking oncogenic signaling with a Hsp90 inhibitor would impair metastatic behavior of colon cancer cells and also improve the efficacy of oxaliplatin in vivo. Human colon cancer cells (HCT116, HT29, and SW620) and the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) were used for experiments. In vitro, 17-DMAG substantially inhibited phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Met, and focal adhesion kinase, overall resulting in a significant decrease in cancer cell invasiveness. Importantly, 17-DMAG led to an up-regulation of the transcription factor activating transcription factor-3, a tumor suppressor and antimetastatic factor, on mRNA and protein levels. In a cell death ELISA, 17-DMAG markedly induced apoptosis in both p53-wt and p53-deficient cells. In vivo, 17-DMAG significantly reduced tumor growth and vascularization. Furthermore, blocking Hsp90 reduced hepatic tumor burden and metastatic nodules in an experimental model of hepatic colon cancer growth. Importantly, combining oxaliplatin with 17-DMAG in vivo significantly improved growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects on p53-deficient cells, compared with either substance alone. In conclusion, inhibition of Hsp90 abrogates the invasive properties of colon cancer cells and modulates the expression of the antimetastatic factor activating transcription factor-3. Hence, targeting Hsp90 could prove valuable for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer by effectively inhibiting colon cancer growth and hepatic metastasis and improving the efficacy of oxaliplatin.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["ChristianMoser", "Sven ALang", "SilviaKainz", "AndreasGaumann", "StefanFichtner-Feigl", "Gudrun EKoehl", "Hans JSchlitt", "Edward KGeissler", "OliverStoeltzing"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0410"}

Different proteins are phosphorylated under acidic environments in Jurkat cells. Immunol Lett 2002;82:155-8). In this study, we investigated the protein phosphotyrosine level in Jurkat and Jurkat mutant cells under different pH conditions. The ZAP-70 phosphorylation level increased under acidic environments. P38 MAPK was more activated at acidic pH. The level of active p38 was low in mutant P116 deficient in ZAP-70, and interestingly the level remained consistently low at all pH values tested. The activation of ERK was not stimulated at low pH.

The keys to the success of intramedullary stabilization of femoral fractures--reconstruction of length, axis and rotation rather than meticulous reduction of the fragments and minimal impact on fragment vascularization by the surgical approach--can be transferred to the treatment of periprosthetic fractures.\nThe Bicontact revision stem can be regarded as a combination of an interlocking nail in its distal part and a proximally coated femoral stem in its proximal part. The transfemoral approach respects the vascularization of the bone, although it is not minimally invasive. Forty-one patients with a mean age of 72.3 years and a periprosthetic fracture were included in this study. According to the Vancouver classification there were 2 type A fractures of the trochanteric region, 14 were B1, 8 were B2 with prior loosening, 13 were B3 with significant bone loss, and 2 fractures were distal to the tip of the prosthesis (type C).\nIn all patients, intramedullary stabilization with a Bicontact revision stem was performed. All but three fractures healed (pathologic fracture with multiple myeloma in one case, impaired bone healing in two cases). In 7 patients, further procedures had to be undertaken (new periprosthetic fracture in 2, loosening and revision with a standard prosthesis in 2, revision with a long stem prosthesis together with bone grafting in 3 cases). At follow-up, after a mean of 4.3 years, all patients were able to walk, and the mean Harris Hip Score was 71.1 points.\nIn conclusion, combined application of the principles of intramedullary nailing and of uncemented total hip replacement by use of the distally interlocked Bicontact revision stem enables successful treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures.", "journal": "Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["CEingartner", "UOchs", "DEgetemeyer", "RVolkmann"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2007-965657"}

So, this study aims to investigate the role of laser preconditioning on the vascularisation of bone after X-ray radiation. An optical bone chamber allowed the study of the vascularization process. The vascular density (VD) was determined using image processing.

VD remained stable during 12-week follow up for groups #1 and #2. X-ray radiation lead to an important decrease of the superficial bone vascularization in group #3. The decrease of the vascularization was limited in group #4 highlighting a different evolution between group #3 and #4. Those results were confirmed by histological analysis.

The suspension of mixed testes cells was cultured to obtain various somatic cells of testes and Leydig cells were collected by differential anchorage-dependent method. These two kinds of cells were seeded onto biodegradable scaffolds of polyglycolic acid (PGA) fibers and cultured in vitro. The tissue formation of cell-scaffold constructs was observed by optical microscope and electronic microscope and the level of testosterone in the supernatant was detected regularly. After 7-day culture in vitro, the 2 kinds of cell-scaffold constructs, scaffold with purified Leydig cells or co-cultured testis somatic cells (seed cells), were implanted into the gastrocolic omentum or cavity of tunica vaginalis of the castrated rats. The implants were harvested 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 weeks later to evaluate the tissue formation of cell-scaffold constructs in vivo. The serum testosterone level of the implanted rats was assayed to evaluate the testosterone secreting function of the regenerative tissue.\nBoth the co-cultured testis somatic cells and Leydig cells had fine compatibility with the PGA fibers and adhered to the scaffolds very well. Testosterone was detected at a certain degree in the supernatant of cell-scaffold constructs, indicating the testosterone secreting function of the constructs. Two months after the implantation both kinds of cell-scaffold constructs formed testosterone secreting tissue in both gastrocolic omentum and cavity of tunica vaginalis of the implanted rats.

Although not frequent, the diagnosis of its cause is crucial because of its potential severity in some cases. This article describes some of the diagnostic clues for arterial causes (arteriosclerosis, aberrant carotid artery, arteriovenous fistula or malformations, increased vascularization in Paget's disease) and venous causes (benign intracranial hypertension, high jugular bulb). In some cases we have to rule out other systemic diseases as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia or hyperthyroidism. A pathological otoscopy result may be secondary to a tympanic glomus. A guided medical history and an algorithm for complementary tests (magnetic resonance or angio-resonance imaging, computerized tomography, blood test, Doppler ultrasonography) may resolve the diagnostic puzzle of pulsatile tinnitus. We present our experience in 80 cases.

To this end, we directly compared formation and functions of tissue-engineered blood vessels generated by peripheral blood- and umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs in a model of in vivo vasculogenesis. We found that adult peripheral blood EPCs form blood vessels that are unstable and regress within 3 weeks. In contrast, umbilical cord blood EPCs form normal-functioning blood vessels that last for more than 4 months. These vessels exhibit normal blood flow, perm-selectivity to macromolecules, and induction of leukocyte-endothelial interactions in response to cytokine activation similar to normal vessels.

{"title": "The effect of matrix density on the regulation of 3-D capillary morphogenesis.", "abstract": "The means by which extracellular matrix density regulates three-dimensional capillary morphogenesis is unclear. To study this phenomenon, we utilized a fibrin-based in vitro assay in which a fibroblast monolayer is plated atop a fibrin gel approximately 2.5 mm away from endothelial cell-coated beads within the matrix. Increasing fibrin density from 2.5 to 10 mg/ml resulted in a threefold reduction in capillary network formation. However, distributing fibroblasts throughout the matrix completely eliminated this inhibitory effect, resulting in robustly vascularized matrices suitable for in vivo applications, as functional anastomoses formed between the implanted tissues and host vasculature when implanted into immune-compromised mice. Dense matrices did not stimulate fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling: differentiation into myofibroblasts, matrix production, and protease secretion were not enhanced by the dense condition. Instead, quantifying diffusivity of FITC-dextran (molecular mass 10, 40, 70, and 150 kDa) through fibrin revealed a two- to threefold decrease within the 10 mg/ml matrices. Thus, distributing a proangiogenic source (fibroblasts) throughout the matrix stimulates capillary network formation by overcoming this diffusion restriction due to significantly reduced diffusion distances. Although roles for matrix stiffness and ligand binding density have previously been identified, our results emphasize the importance of diffusion restrictions in limiting capillary morphogenesis.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2007-11-13", "authors": ["Cyrus MGhajar", "XiaofangChen", "Joseph WHarris", "VinodSuresh", "Christopher C WHughes", "Noo LiJeon", "Andrew JPutnam", "Steven CGeorge"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.107.120774"}

Then, hMSO (5 x 10(5)/ml) and hUVEC (2.5 x 10(5)/ml) were seeded at a ratio of 2 : 1 onto the CHA scaffolds coated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (the experimental group) or onto the CHA scaffolds without 1,25-(OH)2D3 (the control group). The scaffolds were cultured in vitro for 3 days, and then the scaffolds were implanted into the pockets that had been made on the backs of 18 nude mice. Then, 6 of the mice were implanted with one experimental engineered bone bilaterally; another 6 mice were implanted with one control engineered bone bilaterally; the remaining 6 mice were implanted with one experimental engineered bone and one control engineered bone on each side. At 4, 8 and 12 weeks after operation, the retrieved scaffolds and cells were examined by the nake eye and histology as well as by the scanning electron microscopy. The quantitative assessment of the newly-formed bone and the quantitative analysis of the newly-formed blood vessels were performed.\nThe evaluations by the histology revealed that at 4 weeks the original bone tissues grew into the scaffolds in all the groups, but significantly more newly-formed bone tissues and newly-formed blood vessels were found in the experimental group. At 12 weeks the newly-formed bone tissues were found in all the groups, but there was a typical bone unit found in the experimental group. There was a significantly smaller amount of capillary vessels in the control group than in the experimental group at all the time points. The evaluations by the scanning electron microscopy revealed that at 4 weeks in the experimental group there were great amounts of extracelluar matrix that embedded the cells, and plenty of capillary vessels were found on the surface of the implanted bone materials and some of them grew into the materials; however, in the control group there was a smaller amount of capillary vessels although much extracelluar matrix was still found there. At 8 weeks sarciniform osteoids were found on some of the implanted materials, with much extracelluar matrix and many newly-formed capillary vessels in the experimental group; however, in the control group there were fewer capillary vessels and lower degrees of the bone maturity. The quantitative assessment of the newly-formed bone showed that the new-formed bones were 3.1 +/- 0.52 in the experimental group but 2.30 +/- 0.59 in the control group at 8 weeks (P < 0.05), and 4.63 +/- 0.55 vs. 3.53 +/- 0.62 at 12 weeks.

Our aim was to assess the MDCTA signs and role in managing hemoptysis of pulmonary arterial origin.\nWe performed a retrospective clinical and radiologic analysis of all consecutive patients who were referred for severe hemoptysis to our RICU and were treated by endovascular means between January 2004 and December 2006.

Depending on the intraoperative findings, the musculocutaneous nerve is neurotized by the phrenic nerve at the time of primary operation or secondarily neurotized by the contralateral C7 root. If the musculocutaneous nerve could be neurotized by the phrenic nerve, C7-transfer is used to reinnervate the median nerve. If ever possible, the vascularized ulnar nerve graft or if not availabe two sural nerves are used. Neurotization of the musculocutaneous nerve was carried out in 6, and of the median nerve in 4 patients. There are 6 patients in the MC group and 4 patients in the Median group. Criterias for evaluation used are: donor site (morbidity, classification), time for recovery, time for autonomization, and functional result. Successful elbow flexion is achieved if muscle power > M3, successful median nerve motor function is achieved if a primitive power grip pattern is achieved.\nAll patients were complaining of temporary paresthesia in the dorsal part of P3 of the thumb, index and middle finger.

This prompted us to investigate the possibility of producing bone tissue both in vitro and ectopically in vivo using vascular endothelial cells because we hypothesized that the direct contact or interaction between vascular endothelial cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are of benefit to osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. For that purpose we co-cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and kidney vascular endothelial cells (VEC) with polylactide-glycolic acid scaffolds. In vitro experiments using alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin assays demonstrated the proliferation and differentiation of MSC into osteoblast-like cells, especially the direct contact between VEC and MSC. In addition, histochemical analysis with CD31 and von-Willebrand factor staining showed that VEC retained their endothelial characteristics. In vivo implantation of MSC and VEC co-cultures into rat's muscle resulted in pre-vascular network-like structure established by the VEC in the PLGA. These structures developed into vascularized tissue, and increased the amount and size of the new bone compared to the control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the vascular endothelial cells could efficiently stimulate the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells and promote osteogenesis in vivo by the direct contact or interaction with the MSC. This technique for optimal regeneration of bone should be further investigated.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2007-11-06", "authors": ["HongchenSun", "ZheQu", "YingGuo", "GuangxiangZang", "BaiYang"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-6-41\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2685\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00608-1\n10.1089/1076327041348338\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2003.03931.x\n10.1016/S0003-4975(00)01255-8\n10.1089/107632702760240454\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00120-4\n10.1002/1097-4644(20001215)79:4<672::AID-JCB150>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1054/ijom.2001.0130\n10.1053/ejvs.2001.1316\n10.1369/jhc.4A6514.2005\n10.1002/jcb.240550306\n10.1016/0142-9612(96)85754-1\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199722)38:2<105::AID-JBM4>3.0.CO;2-U\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2717\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00120-4\n10.1016/S8756-3282(96)00133-0\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050034\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1089/107632703762687573"}
{"title": "Paracrine effects of transplanted myoblasts and relaxin on post-infarction heart remodelling.", "abstract": "In the post-infarcted heart, grafting of precursor cells may partially restore heart function but the improvement is modest and the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. Here, we explored this issue by transplanting C2C12 myoblasts, genetically engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or eGFP and the cardiotropic hormone relaxin (RLX) through coronary venous route to swine with experimental chronic myocardial infarction. The rationale was to deliver constant, biologically effective levels of RLX at the site of cell engraftment. One month after engraftment, histological analysis showed that C2C12 myoblasts selectively settled in the ischaemic scar and were located around blood vessels showing an activated endothelium (ICAM-1-,VCAM-positive). C2C12 myoblasts did not trans-differentiate towards a cardiac phenotype, but did induce extracellular matrix remodelling by the secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and increase microvessel density through the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Relaxin-producing C2C12 myoblasts displayed greater efficacy to engraft the post-ischaemic scar and to induce extracellular matrix re-modelling and angiogenesis as compared with the control cells. By echocardiography, C2C12-engrafted swine showed improved heart contractility compared with the ungrafted controls, especially those producing RLX. We suggest that the beneficial effects of myoblast grafting on cardiac function are primarily dependent on the paracrine effects of transplanted cells on extracellular matrix remodelling and vascularization. The combined treatment with myoblast transplantation and local RLX production may be helpful in preventing deleterious cardiac remodelling and may hold therapeutic possibility for post-infarcted patients.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2007-11-06", "authors": ["LuciaFormigli", "Avio-MariaPerna", "ElisabettaMeacci", "LorenzoCinci", "MartinaMargheri", "SilviaNistri", "AlessiaTani", "JoshSilvertown", "GiovanniOrlandini", "CristinaPorciani", "SandraZecchi-Orlandini", "JeffreyMedin", "DanieleBani"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00111.x"}

Identifying mechanisms which regulate the role of MSCs in vasculogenesis is a key therapeutic objective, since while increased neovascularization can be advantageous during tissue ischaemia, it is deleterious during tumourigenesis. The potent angiogenic stimulant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to regulate MSC mobilization and recruitment to sites of neovascularization, as well as directing the differentiation of MSCs to a vascular cell fate. Despite the fact that MSCs did not express VEGF receptors, we have recently identified that VEGF-A can stimulate platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, which regulates MSC migration and proliferation.

Eight RAM flaps from four fresh cadavers were used. During surgical dissection, utmost care was paid to enclose the areolar tissue between the main deep inferior epigastric (DIE) vessels and the pubic bone. A bone segment, 1.5 x 5 cm in dimension with an intact periosteum, was included with the RAM. Surgical dissections revealed two major vascular branches. The first branch arising from the DIE artery (DIEA) at a distance of 5.2 +/- 1.4 cm from the origin gave rise to two consistent subbranches. The second major branch originated from the DIEA at a distance of 8.4 +/- 1.8 cm from the origin. The first branch gave off two subbranches. The second subbranch coursed anteromedially and nourished the periosteum of the pubic bone. Microangiography showed a similar branching pattern of the vessels that create two significant networks. The X-rays confirmed a rich vascular network around the periosteum of the pubic bone. This wealthy nourishment of the pubic periosteum comes mainly from the perpendicular descending branches.

In a series of eight consecutive patients (two men, six women) suffering from contour deformities due to different reasons (scleroderma: three, Parry-Romberg syndrome: three, trauma: one, tumor: one), soft tissue augmentations were performed via a preauricular approach. Flaps were harvested from the ALT as perforator-based dermofat (two) or adipofascial flaps (six) with only a small sheet of fascia and a minimal cuff of muscle around the perforators. All flaps were anastomosed to the superficial temporal vessels. For refinement of the primary result, excess volume was removed and minor contour irregularities were smoothed out after 6 months. Despite the small-vessel caliber, anastomoses caused no problems, and all flaps healed well. Because defects were located close to the temporal vessels, the length of the perforator pedicle was always sufficient. Facial contour could further be improved after secondary reshaping of the healed flaps. This led to nearly perfect long-term facial symmetry in all cases. The ALT proved to be a reliable donor site, providing enough well-vascularized fatty tissue for facial contour augmentation in normal-weight patients. No submandibular incision is necessary if the perforators are anastomosed to the superficial temporal vessels.

{"title": "Paucity of pericytes in germinal matrix vasculature of premature infants.", "abstract": "Germinal matrix (GM) is a richly vascularized collection of neuronal-glial precursor cells in the developing brain, which is selectively vulnerable to hemorrhage in premature infants. It has rapid angiogenesis associated with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because pericytes provide structural stability to blood vessels, we asked whether pericytes were fewer in the GM than in the subjacent white matter and neocortex and, if so, whether angiogenic inhibition could increase the pericyte density in the GM. We found pericyte coverage and density less in the GM vasculature than in the cortex or white matter in human fetuses, premature infants, and premature rabbit pups. Notably, although VEGF suppression significantly enhanced pericyte coverage in the GM, it remained less than in other brain regions. Therefore, to further elucidate the basis of fewer pericytes in the GM vasculature, we examined expression of ligand-receptor systems responsible for pericyte recruitment. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) protein expression was lower, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate1 (S1P1) and N-cadherin levels were higher in the GM than in the cortex or white matter. Low TGF-beta1 may be involved in promoting endothelial proliferation, whereas elevated S1P1 with N-cadherin may assist vascular maturation. Hence, a paucity of pericytes in the GM vasculature may contribute to its propensity to hemorrhage, and a lower expression of TGF-beta1 could be a basis of reduced pericyte density in its vasculature.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2007-11-06", "authors": ["AlexBraun", "HongminXu", "FurongHu", "PraneethKocherlakota", "DonaldSiegel", "PraveenChander", "ZoltanUngvari", "AnnaCsiszar", "MaikenNedergaard", "PraveenBallabh"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3281-07.2007"}

Changes in signaling pathway activation upon Hsp90 blockade were investigated by Western blotting. Effects of Hsp90 inhibition (17-AAG) on vascular endothelial growth factor were determined by ELISA and real-time PCR. Effects of 17-DMAG (25 mg/kg; thrice a week; i.p.) on tumor growth and vascularization were investigated in a s.c. xenograft model and in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer.\n17-AAG inhibited IGF-IR signaling by down-regulating IGF-IRbeta and directly impairing IGF-IR phosphorylation. Hypoxia- and IL-6-mediated activation of HIF-1alpha or STAT3/STAT5 were substantially inhibited by 17-AAG. Moreover, a novel IL-6/STAT3/HIF-1alpha autocrine loop was effectively disrupted by Hsp90 blockade. In vivo, 17-DMAG significantly reduced s.c. tumor growth and diminished STAT3 phosphorylation and IGF-IRbeta expression in tumor tissues. In an orthotopic model, pancreatic tumor growth and vascularization were both significantly reduced upon Hsp90 inhibition, as reflected by final tumor weights and CD31 staining, respectively.\nBlocking Hsp90 disrupts IGF-I and IL-6-induced proangiogenic signaling cascades by targeting IGF-IR and STAT3 in pancreatic cancer, leading to significant growth-inhibitory effects.

DSA was performed in selected patients following MRI.\nIn patients with arteriovenous fistulas and malformations, MRA allowed the vascular shunt to be identified and correctly classified. Hemodynamic characteristics and venous architecture were clearly demonstrated. Larger feeding arteries could be identified in all patients. In meningiomas, MRA enabled assessment of the displacement of the cerebral arteries, depiction of the tumor feeding vessels, and evaluation of the anatomy of the venous system. The extent of tumor vascularization could be assessed in all patients and correlated with the histopathological findings that indicated hypervascularization.\nHigh temporal and spatial resolution 3-D MRA may allow correct identification and classification of fistulas and angiomas and help to reduce the number of pre-or postinterventional invasive diagnostic angiograms. This sequence is also helpful for characterizing the degree of vascularization in preoperative evaluation of meningiomas and to select meningiomas suitable for embolization. Displacement of normal arteries and depiction of the venous anatomy can be achieved cost-effectively in a short period of time. The high spatial resolution also permits improved demonstration of the major feeding arteries, which helps to reduce the number of conventional angiograms required for meningioma evaluation.", "journal": "Neuroradiology", "date": "2007-11-02", "authors": ["Peter CReinacher", "PaulStracke", "Marcus H TReinges", "Franz JHans", "TimoKrings"], "doi": "10.1007/s00234-007-1468-6"}

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells in breast cancer patients.", "abstract": "Development of new capillary blood vessels is essential for the growth of cancer. Two distinct processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis implement the formation of the new vascular network. Recently, it was demonstrated that vasculogenesis creates the primary network of vascular endothelial cells that will become major blood vessels in malignant tumors by the recruitment of CD34(+)/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (FLK-1)(+ )endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to sites of the new vessel formation with subsequent differentiation into mature endothelial cell. Therefore the aim of this study was a) to quantitate EPCs in breast cancer patients and b) to evaluate if the release of EPCs into the circulation is mainly regulated by the tumor himself.\nCD34(+)FLK-1(+ )EPCs were measured in the peripheral circulation of patients with breast cancer (n = 47) before and after therapy. Furthermore the potential of EPCs to differentiate into endothelial cells was investigated by late-outgrowth experiments and the metabolic uptake of dil-acetylated-LDL and immunoreactivity against von Willebrand factor.\nIn breast cancer patients the amount of CD34(+)FLK-1(+ )EPCs (percent of peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is significantly increased in women with breast cancer. Tumors larger than 2 cm showed significantly higher values of CD34(+)FLK-1(+ )EPCs. After excision of the tumor the amount of CD34(+)FLK-1(+ )EPCs rapidly declines.\nOur findings lead to the tumor, as source of angiogenic chemokines, is most important for recruiting CD34(+)FLK-1(+ )EPCs during breast cancer development. Therefore circulating endothelial progenitor cells may work as a new diagnostic tool in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2007-11-01", "authors": ["ChristianeRichter-Ehrenstein", "J\u00f6rnRentzsch", "SanyuktaRunkel", "AchimSchneider", "GilbertSch\u00f6nfelder"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-007-9505-z"}
{"title": "The core protein of growth plate perlecan binds FGF-18 and alters its mitogenic effect on chondrocytes.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-18 (FGF-18) has been shown to regulate the growth plate chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy and cartilage vascularization necessary for endochondral ossification. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan is also critical for growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. FGF-18 null mice exhibit a skeletal dwarfism similar to that of perlecan null mice. Growth plate perlecan contains chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) chains and FGF-18 is known to bind to heparin and to heparan sulfate from some sources. We used cationic filtration and immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the binding of FGF-18 to perlecan purified from the growth plate and to recombinant perlecan domains expressed in COS-7 cells. FGF-18 bound to perlecan with a K(d) of 145 nM. Near saturation, approximately 103 molecules of FGF-18 bound per molecule of perlecan. At the lower concentrations used, FGF-18 bound with a K(d) of 27.8 nM. This binding was not significantly altered by chondroitinase nor heparitinase digestion of perlecan, but was substantially and significantly reduced by reduction and alkylation of the perlecan core protein. This indicates that the perlecan core protein (and not the CS nor HS chains) is involved in FGF-18 binding. FGF-18 bound equally to full-length perlecan purified from the growth plate and to recombinant domains I-III and III of perlecan. These data indicate that low affinity binding sites for FGF-18 are present in cysteine-rich regions of domain III of perlecan. FGF-18 stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in growth plate chondrocyte cultures derived from the lower and upper proliferating zones by 9- and 14-fold, respectively. The addition of perlecan reversed this increased incorporation in the lower proliferating chondrocytes by 74% and in the upper proliferating cells by 37%. These results suggest that perlecan can bind FGF-18 and alter the mitogenic effect of FGF-18 on growth plate chondrocytes.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2007-11-01", "authors": ["Simone M-LSmith", "Leigh AWest", "John RHassell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2007.10.006"}

This contribution proposes a diffusion-perfusion (DP) model in which diffusion of a low molecular weight CA is incorporated in the standard two-compartment Tofts model. The proposed DP model reliably retrieved the values of K(trans) and v(e) (mean ARD of 16% and 17%, respectively) from simulated data. On mouse adenocarcinoma xenograft data showing evidence of CA diffusion, the standard model returned unphysical values of v(e) in the tumor core whereas the proposed DP model found values that were in the physical range (0 < v(e) < 1) throughout the tissue.

Encephalization punctuated hominid evolution, its vulnerable feature, a lower threshold for thermal damage. Comparative analysis of ape and human skulls show \"fingerprint\" structures, revealing big changes in pattern complexity of the cranial vascular tree. Clues to structural/functional changes span data for apes, humans, and hominid fossils. Here, the increasing vascular network, Australopithecus to Homo sapiens, necessitated changes in the blood flow patterns. The transverse-sigmoid (T/S) and occipital-marginal (O/M) venous networks accommodated hydrostatic changes of blood flow, regulating temperature uniquely: the O/M system enlarged, allowing blood to flow straight down into the vertebral plexus without cooling, and added a vast network of emissary/diploic veins, acting as a brain cooling \"radiator.\" This O/M system was fixed in the Australopithecus robustus lineage, p = 0.000001; high frequencies of emissary foramen were selected for over time. Ontologically, the human neonatal O/M system is fully developed; emissary/diploic veins are established by age 5, setting conditions for selective brain cooling.\nThe Radiator Theory is the evolution of the functionally efficient brain cooling system, fixed in the A. robustus lineage, tying hydrostatic consequences of bipedalism with release of a \"thermal constraint\" on the encephalizing brain, and reflected in our own ontogeny.", "journal": "Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery", "date": "2007-10-31", "authors": ["Alexandra RKunz", "CharalamposIliadis"], "doi": "10.1007/s00381-007-0468-5"}

{"title": "Role of oxidative stress from mitochondria on aging and cancer.", "abstract": "Much attention has been focused on the hypothesis that oxidative damage plays a part in cellular and organismal aging. Oxygen is initially converted to superoxide anion (O2), one of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), by electrons mainly leaked from complex III in the electron transport system present in mitochondria, where it is the major endogenous source of ROS. We have shown that a mutation in a subunit, cytochrome b large subunit (SDHC), of complex II, also results in increasing O2 production and therefore leads to apoptosis and precocious aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recently, individuals with an inherited propensity for vascularized head and neck tumors (ie, paragangliomas) have been shown to possess one of several mutations in complex II. To further explore the role of oxidative stress from mitochondria on apoptosis and cancer, we established a transgenic cell line with a point mutation at the ubiquinone binding region in the SDHC gene. As expected, this mutation increased O2 production from complex II and led to excess apoptosis. Moreover, a significant fraction of the surviving cells from the apoptosis were transformed, as evidenced by increased tumor formation, after injection into mice. Oxidative stress results in damage to the cellular components including mitochondria and therefore leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress seems to cause mutations in DNA and leads to cancer. It is suggested that oxidative stress from mitochondria plays an important role in apoptosis, which leads to precocious aging and cancer.", "journal": "Cornea", "date": "2007-10-27", "authors": ["NaoakiIshii"], "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0b013e31812f6745"}

The aberrant angiogenesis that occurs in eutopic endometrium may play a role in the lesion formation and survival. The difference in gene expression profile between human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) from eutopic endometria of patients with and without endometriosis would be a factor that affects the occurrence of endometriosis.\nTo explore the difference, we performed in vitro culture and identified the endothelial origin, as well as observed growth features, of HEECs from the two different sources. We also identified their differences in gene expression profiles by combined suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) with Genechip, and confirmed the results by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe HEECs derived from endometriosis patients exhibited a potent survival ability in vitro compared with those from non-endometriosis patients. In the HEECs from EM patients, an altered secretion pattern of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and up-regulation of GREM1 were found. These findings may be used to interpret the remarkable change of phenotype in HEECs from endometriosis patients. The synergistic action of these differentially expressed genes is to promote cell proliferation and concomitantly to inhibit apoptosis. Among the up-regulated ECM genes, TSP2 was the only one which exhibits the capacity to suppress angiogenesis; it may therefore function as an antagonist to the aberrant angiogenesis and may confine its extent and severity.\nIt may be postulated that differential regulation of some of these genes in eutopic HEECs plays a facilitating role during the peritoneal vascularization of ectopic endometrial lesions by enhancing angiogenic activity via a paracrine effect.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2007-10-25", "authors": ["GSha", "DWu", "LZhang", "XChen", "MLei", "HSun", "SLin", "JLang"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/dem266"}

We used this experimental model to understand the cause of the defects associated with TD by determining the expression of selective candidate genes associated with vascularization and cell survival. Week-old broiler chickens were fed 100 ppm thiram for 48 h between d 8 and 10 posthatch and the expression of the genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), and an antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2) were determined in the growth plate cartilage at 48 and 166 h after feeding thiram. Reverse transcription PCR and capillary electrophoresis were used to determine the expression of these genes relative to the 18S gene as an internal standard. There was an increase in the expression of the VEGF gene by thiram at 48 h, which remained elevated above the control level at 166 h. A suppression of genes encoding both VEGF receptors and Bcl-2 was evident at 48 h in thiram-fed chickens when there was no visible distension of growth plate indicative of TD. At 166 h, however, there was a significant distension of growth plates in thiram-treated birds, with a high percentage of cells derived from these tissues exhibiting characteristics of dead cells. Although the expressions of VEGF receptors were low at 166 h in thiram-treated birds, they were not statistically different from controls; the Bcl-2 gene expression, however, remained significantly downregulated in those birds. It appears that some of the early effects of thiram on the growth plate may be the failure of genes encoding VEGF receptors and Bcl-2 resulting from endothelial cell death, which compromise vascularization, cartilage remodeling, and the removal of dead chondrocytes leading to TD lesions.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2007-10-24", "authors": ["N CRath", "W EHuff", "G RHuff"], "doi": "10.3382/ps.2007-00219"}

{"title": "Evaluation of alternative sites for islet transplantation in the minipig: interest and limits of the gastric submucosa.", "abstract": "Since the introduction of glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimens, islet transplantation offers a less invasive alternative to pancreas transplantation. However, complications associated with intraportal islet injection and the progressive functional decline of intrahepatic islets encourage the exploration of alternative sites. Herein we evaluated, in the minipig, the use of the gastric submucosa (GS; group 1, n = 5) for islet transplantation compared with the kidney capsule (KC; group 2, n = 5). Subsequently we attempted to improve the vascularization of the submucosal graft (group 3, n = 5) by the addition of an extracellular matrix rich in growth factors (Matrigel). One month after grafting, we evaluated transplanted islet function in vivo and in vitro. Our study showed better function of islets engrafted in the GS than in the KC (P < .05). Despite the growth factors, Matrigel did not offer a more suitable environment to further improve engraftment (group 3, P < .05). Thus, even if the liver remains the gold standard, the GS represents a potential islet engraftment site, confirming the data obtained in vitro and in the rodent. Offering easy access by endoscopy, this site could constitute an interesting alternative for experimental studies in large mammals and, eventually, for clinical application.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2007-10-24", "authors": ["RCaiazzo", "VGmyr", "THubert", "NDelalleau", "RLamberts", "EMoerman", "JKerr-Conte", "FPattou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.08.015"}

Thereafter the follow-up was performed semi-annually. Patients were informed about the functional signs for which they have to urgently consult.\nImmunologic rejection of the corneal graft occurred in 128 KPT in 112 patients (rejection frequency = 41%). The identified main risk factors were new vascularization of the recipient cornea over 2 or more quadrants, corneal opacity due to an infectious origin, posttraumatic corneal opacity or congenital glaucoma, graft diameter >8 mm, and therapeutic KPT.\nRejection of the corneal graft is the primary cause of KPT failure. One out of 2 graft failures was due to rejection. Two criteria are unanimously recognized as risk factors for rejection: neovascularization of recipient cornea and antecedents of corneal rejection.

We report here on the production, the characterization and the in vivo anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties of a novel alpha(v)beta(3)-binding disintegrin, DisBa-01, isolated from a cDNA library made with RNAs from the venom gland of Bothrops alternatus. The 11,637 Da-recombinant monomeric form of DisBa-01 displayed an RGD motif and interacted with purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in surface plasmon resonance studies, in a dose-dependent and cation sensitive manner. A three-dimensional molecular model of DisBa-01 in complex with alpha(v)beta(3) predicted a large surface of contacts with the beta(3) subunit. DisBa-01 inhibited the adhesion of alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) and murine melanoma cell line B16F10 to vitronectin (IC(50) = 555 nM and 225 nM, respectively), and transiently inhibited their proliferation without direct cell toxicity, but did not affect the binding nor the proliferation of a human breast cancer-derived cell line (MDA-MB-231) not expressing alpha(v)beta(3). In vivo, DisBa-01 dose-dependently decreased bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a matrigel plug assay in athymic nude mice (IC(50) = 83 nM). When injected intravenously to C57BL/6 mice together with B16F10 melanoma cells, DisBa-01 time- and dose-dependently inhibited lung metastasis monitored by bioluminescent imaging.

Histochemical tests were employed to identify the main metabolites on nectary tissue and secretion samples.\nThe floral nectary consists of the inner epidermis of the hypanthium and vascularized parenchyma. Some evidence indicates that the nectar release occurs via the stomata. The high populations of mitochondria, and their juxtaposition with amyloplasts, seem to be related to energy needs for starch hydrolysis. Among the alterations observed during the secretory phase, the reduction in the plastid stromatic density and starch grain size are highlighted. When the secretory stage begins, the plastid envelope disappears and a new membrane is formed, enclosing this region and giving rise to new vacuoles. After the secretory stage, cellular structures named 'extrastomatic bodies' were observed and seem to be related to the nectar resorption.\nStarch hydrolysis contributes to nectar formation, in addition to the photosynthates derived directly from the phloem. In these nectaries, the secretion is an energy-requiring process. During the secretion stage, some plastids show starch grain hydrolysis and membrane rupture, and it was observed that the region previously occupied by this organelle continued to be reasonably well defined, and gave rise to new vacuoles. The extrastomatic bodies appear to be related to the resorption of uncollected nectar.", "journal": "Annals of botany", "date": "2007-10-24", "authors": ["Elder Antonio SousaPaiva", "Silvia RodriguesMachado"], "doi": "10.1093/aob/mcm268"}

Immunohistochemistry was performed for Helix-II and CTX-II, which are type II collagen fragments originating from the triple helix and the telopeptide region, respectively, and believed to reflect distinct breakdown events, as well as for type IIA N propeptide (PIIANP), a biochemical marker reflecting synthesis of type IIA collagen.\nHelix-II and CTX-II were detected in areas where collagen damage was reported previously, most frequently around chondrocytes, but also frequently in regions not previously investigated such as the margin area and close to subchondral bone, including vascularization sites and bone-cartilage interface. The latter is CTX-II's prevailing position and shows rarely Helix-II. PIIANP co-localized with Helix-II and CTX-II on a limited number of features, mainly in deep zone cartilage. Overall, our analysis highlights clear patterns of association of the markers with specific histological features, and shows that they spread to these features in an ordered way.\nHelix-II and CTX-II show to some degree differential selectivity for specific features in cartilage tissue. CTX-II detection close to bone may be relevant to the possible role of subchondral bone in OA. The restricted co-localization of breakdown markers and PIIANP suggests that collagen fragments can result only partially from newly synthesized collagen.

Endometriosis is produced in cycling rats by autotransplanting pieces of uterus onto abdominal arteries where they develop into cysts. The surgery induces vaginal and abdominal muscle hyperalgesia, whose severity is greatest in proestrus and nearly absent in estrus. The cysts contain growth factors and cytokines and develop their own sympathetic and sensory C- and Adelta-fiber innervation. Here, we used quantitative immunostaining and protein array analyses to test the hypothesis that the innervation and growth factor/cytokine content of the cysts, but not uterine horn, contribute to proestrous-to-estrous changes in hyperalgesic severity. If so, these characteristics in the cysts, but not the uterine horn, should change with estrous stage. In cysts, the density of sympathetic (but not sensory) neurites and amounts of NGF and VEGF proteins (but not cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, or TNF-alpha) were greater in proestrus than estrus. These changes were accompanied by vascular changes. Both sympathetic and sensory fibers in both stages colabeled with TrkA, indicating that changes in NGF could act on both afferent and efferent fibers. In contrast with the cysts, no changes occurred in the uterine horn between proestrus and estrus. Together, these results suggest that coordinated proestrous-to-estrous changes in innervation and vascularization of the cysts contribute to similar changes in hyperalgesic severity.

{"title": "Treatment of metastatic renal cancer with capsid-modified oncolytic adenoviruses.", "abstract": "Renal cancer is a common and deadly disease that lacks curative treatments when metastatic. Here, we have used oncolytic adenoviruses, a promising developmental approach whose safety has recently been validated in clinical trials. Although preliminary clinical efficacy data exist for selected tumor types, potency has generally been less than impressive. One important reason may be that expression of the primary receptor, coxsackie-adenovirus receptor, is often low on many or most advanced tumors, although not evaluated in detail with renal cancer. Here, we tested if fluorescence-assisted cell sorting could be used to predict efficacy of a panel of infectivity-enhanced capsid-modified marker gene expressing adenoviruses in renal cancer cell lines, clinical specimens, and subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models of peritoneally metastatic renal cell cancer. The respective selectively oncolytic adenoviruses were tested for killing of tumor cells in these models, and biodistribution after locoregional delivery was evaluated. In vivo replication was analyzed with noninvasive imaging. Ad5/3-Delta24, Ad5-Delta24RGD, and Ad5.pK7-Delta24 significantly increased survival of mice compared with mock or wild-type virus and 50% of Ad5/3-Delta24 treated mice were alive at 320 days. Because renal tumors are often highly vascularized, we investigated if results could be further improved by adding bevacizumab, a humanized antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody.

The diploic space of the skull bone contains a sinusoidal vascular network that communicates with the underlying dura mater. Diploic veins in the parasagittal area connect with endothelium-lined intradural channels in the subjacent dura and ultimately with the dural venous sinuses. A significant proportion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption is thought to occur via arachnoid granulations in the region of the SSS and especially along the parasagittal dura where arachnoid granulations are surrounded by intradural venous channels (lateral lacunae). The CSF is likely to be conducted from the subarachnoid space into the venous system via the fine intradural channels making up the lateral lacunae.\nInfusion of vinyl acetate casting material into the diploic space of the human cadaveric skull resulted in complete filling of the lateral lacunae and SSS. Corrosion casting techniques and examination under magnification were used to characterize the anatomical connections between diploic spaces and dural venous sinuses.\nCorrosion casting, performed on five formalin-fixed cadavers, clearly showed the anatomical connections between the diploic infusion site and the venous sinuses in the underlying parasagittal dura where some of the CSF is thought to be absorbed.\nThe diploic vascular channels of the human skull may represent an indirect pathway into the dural venous sinuses.

{"title": "Hybrid bone implants: self-assembly of peptide amphiphile nanofibers within porous titanium.", "abstract": "Over the past few decades there has been great interest in the use of orthopedic and dental implants that integrate into tissue by promoting bone ingrowth or bone adhesion, thereby eliminating the need for cement fixation. However, strategies to create bioactive implant surfaces to direct cellular activity and mineralization leading to osteointegration are lacking. We report here on a method to prepare a hybrid bone implant material consisting of a Ti-6Al-4V foam, whose 52% porosity is filled with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofiber matrix. These PA nanofibers can be highly bioactive by molecular design, and are used here as a strategy to transform an inert titanium foam into a potentially bioactive implant. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy, we show that PA molecules self-assemble into a nanofiber matrix within the pores of the metallic foam, fully occupying the foam's interconnected porosity. Furthermore, the method allows the encapsulation of cells within the bioactive matrix, and under appropriate conditions the nanofibers can nucleate mineralization of calcium phosphate phases with a Ca:P ratio that corresponds to that of hydroxyapatite. Cell encapsulation was quantified using a DNA measuring assay and qualitatively verified by SEM and confocal microscopy. An in vivo experiment was performed using a bone plug model in the diaphysis of the hind femurs of a Sprague Dawley rat and examined by histology to evaluate the performance of these hybrid systems after 4 weeks of implantation. Preliminary results demonstrate de novo bone formation around and inside the implant, vascularization around the implant, as well as the absence of a cytotoxic response. The PA-Ti hybrid strategy could be potentially tailored to initiate mineralization and direct a cellular response from the host tissue into porous implants to form new bone and thereby improve fixation, osteointegration, and long term stability of implants.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2007-10-16", "authors": ["Timothy DSargeant", "Mustafa OGuler", "Scott MOppenheimer", "AlvaroMata", "Robert LSatcher", "David CDunand", "Samuel IStupp"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.012"}

We hypothesized that neoangiogenesis from the implanted vessels would maintain graft viability and circulation after withdrawal of FK506 (Tacrolimus) immunosuppression. Vascularized femoral transplantation was performed between DA and PVG rats. In addition to microsurgical pedicle anastomoses, a saphenous AV bundle from the recipient animal was implanted in the medullary space. Ninety-seven rats were randomly allocated to groups differing in immunosuppression and AV bundle patency. Implanted vessels significantly improved capillary density and bone blood flow in nonimmunosuppressed and immmunosuppressed groups, respectively. A lower incidence of spontaneous AV bundle thrombosis was found with Tacrolimus treatment. More viable osteocytes were seen at 4 weeks when the AV bundle was patent. Further investigations may confirm host-derived neoangiogenesis as an alternative to tolerance induction or immunosuppression in bone allotransplantation.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2007-10-16", "authors": ["TeruyasuOhno", "MichaelPelzer", "MikkoLarsen", "Patricia FFriedrich", "Allen TBishop"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20427"}

There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the time required to accomplish the TVT, blood loss, length of hospital stay, blood component measurements and postoperative subjective symptoms. There were slight differences postoperatively in problems during intercourse and the appearance of new genital symptoms, but again they were not shown to be statistically significant.\nOur results, although preliminary and subjective, confirm the efficacy of remedial surgical treatment of SUI with TVT.

{"title": "Female infertility and disrupted angiogenesis are actions of specific follistatin isoforms.", "abstract": "The circulating and tissue-bound forms of follistatin (FST315 and FST288, respectively) modulate the actions of activins. FST knockout (KO/null) mice, lacking both isoforms, die perinatally with defects in lung, skin, and the musculoskeletal system. Using constructs of the human FST gene engineered to enable expression of each isoform under the control of natural regulatory elements, transgenic mouse lines were created and crossed with FST null mice to attempt to rescue the neonatal lethality. FST288 expression alone did not rescue the neonatal lethality, but mice expressing FST315 on the KO background survived to adulthood with normal lung and skin morphology and partial reversal of the musculoskeletal defects noted in FST KO mice. The FST315 rescue mice displayed a short period of neonatal growth retardation, impaired tail growth, and female infertility. The latter may be due to failure of corpus luteum formation, a decline in the ovarian follicular population, and an augmented uterine inflammatory response to mating. Failure of corpus luteum formation and impaired tail growth indicate abnormal vascularization and suggest that FST288 is required for the promotion of angiogenesis. The augmented uterine inflammatory response may result from the failure of FST315 to modulate the proinflammatory actions of activin A in the uterus or may result from the altered steroid milieu associated with the ovarian abnormalities.

This might also be the case in cholangiopathies, in which the initial target is the branch of the intrahepatic biliary tree; that is, primary biliary cirrhosis. Previous studies about biliary wound healing focused mainly on the inducers of compensatory biliary proliferation following bile duct insult. Nevertheless, the microenvironment around biliary wound healing responses, which in turn might affect hepatic remodeling, possibly by biliary epithelial cells themselves via paracrine manner, is still less known.\nIn this study, we defined the humoral factors that are released from human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cell lines (HIBEC) with human cytokine array, and reviewed their relevance according to the previous published work.\nConditioned medium of HIBEC were revealed to be rich in multiple cytokines and chemokines, including ELR(+)CXC chemokines, such as interleukin-8/CXCL8, growth-related oncoprotein (GRO), epithelial neutrophil chemoattractant (ENA-78), known chemoattractants with a wide range of non-leukocytic activities. Subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses confirmed that the secretion was commonly observed in various culture conditions and in both an apical and basolateral direction.\nConsidering that some of these factors had been already reported to have direct autocrine mitogenic influence on HIBEC, these findings could further strengthen an active role of HIBEC as a modulator of hepatic regeneration, through its biological reactivity on inflamed milieu.", "journal": "Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology", "date": "2007-10-13", "authors": ["AtsumasaKomori", "MinoruNakamura", "ShinsukeFujiwara", "KojiYano", "HikaruFujioka", "KiyoshiMigita", "HiroshiYatsuhashi", "HiromiIshibashi"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1872-034X.2007.00237.x"}

To this end, we have undertaken a morphological study of 16 archival cases of osteoid osteoma, focusing primarily on the patterns of vascularization, utilizing traditional histological and immunohistochemical approaches. The study demonstrated that a prominent arterial and arteriolar blood supply was a constant finding within the various zones of soft tissues, skeletal muscle, and bone surrounding the nidus. It also showed that the caliber of the vessels underwent gradual attenuation throughout their centripetal course toward the nidus, where the vessels lost their muscularis as they merged into the capillary network of the nidus. Immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament and S100 proteins revealed a pattern of innervation that was overall less exuberant than that described in some reports and that was virtually absent from the nidus.

Implemented on a 4.7-T animal MR system, this technique was applied to mice with colorectal tumor xenografts. AIF, measured in the mouse heart, was modeled by a bi-exponential function, whereas tumor K(trans) and v(e) parameter maps were obtained from analysis with a two- compartment model using an individually measured AIF. AIF analysis of T2*-corrected data yielded A1 = 9.2 +/- 4.3 kg/l, A(2) = 4.2 +/- 0.8 kg/l, m1 = 2.3 +/- 1.1 min(-1), and m2 = 0.05 +/- 0.02 min(-1). The mean initial plasma concentration C ( p )(t = 0) = 8.0 +/- 2.7 mM was compatible with estimated 8.6 mM. Without T2*-correction distribution phase parameters A1, m1, and C(p)(t = 0) were underestimated.

This response was compared to that of glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linked CEM and porcine heart valve (HV), which are designated as GAxCEM and GAxHV, respectively. Tissue composition, inflammatory cell distribution, and angiogenesis at the implant site were quantified using stereological parameters, thickness (Ta), volume fraction (Vv), surface density (Sv), length density (Lv), and radius of diffusion (Rdiff). CEM was completely infiltrated with host tissue at 21 days and resorbed by 63 days. GAxCEM was also infiltrated with host tissue, while GAxHV matrix was impermeable to host tissue infiltration. Both GAxCEM and GAxHV retained their scaffold integrity until 63 days with no apparent degradation. A fibrous tissue of thickness <52 mum, rich in collagen and vasculature, surrounded all scaffolds, and from 21 to 63 days the fibrous tissue showed maturation with a significant increase in their fibrocyte content. No signs of acute inflammatory response were observed in the study period for any of the scaffolds, while the chronic inflammatory response was predominated with macrophages for all scaffolds except for CEM at 63 days. A higher degree of giant cell formation was observed with GA cross-linked scaffolds. From 21 to 63 days, lymphocytic response decreased for CEM, while it increased significantly for GAxHV. Angiogenesis/neo-vascularization was uniform for CEM (reaching the core), significantly lower for GAxCEM within the implant area as compared to CEM, while restricted to the exterior of GAxHV matrix. In summary, CEM was a fast degrading scaffold that induced a transitional inflammatory response accompanied by gradual resorption and replacement by host connective tissue as compared to the very slow degrading GA cross-linked controls, GAxCEM and GAxHV, which caused a sustained chronic inflammatory response and remained at the site of implantation until the end of the study period of 63 days.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2007-10-09", "authors": ["KrishnaBurugapalli", "AbhayPandit"], "doi": "10.1021/bm700560k"}

{"title": "Imaging of intrinsic optical signals in primate cortex during epileptiform activity.", "abstract": "Localized increases in neuronal activity are known to alter the distribution and oxygen content of blood within the surrounding brain tissue. In the neocortex, these activity-evoked hemodynamic changes are predominantly mediated through the dilation of the microscopic pial arterioles that lie on the surface of the brain, nearest to the site of activation. Since hemoglobin absorbs light throughout the visible and near-infrared spectrum, optical microscopy combined with computer imaging techniques can be used to map the patterns of hemodynamic changes associated with neuronal activity. Examples of optical imaging data are provided here to demonstrate four points. First, depending on the optical wavelength chosen for illumination of the cortex, different spatial and temporal patterns of optical changes are elicited by similar stimuli yielding distinctly different types of physiological information. Second, by selecting the appropriate wavelengths, it is possible to generate maps from optical-imaging data that represent changes predominately due to either blood volume (at 535 nm) or blood oxygenation (at 660 nm). Third, \"negative\" optical signals are negative only relative to a given optical wavelength, and appear to be associated with more intense types of neuronal activation. Fourth, optical imaging is a useful technique for studying neocortical seizure activity in animal models, with the caveat that species-specific differences in cortical size and vascularization patterns may be important to consider in the interpretation of optical imaging data.", "journal": "Epilepsia", "date": "2007-10-06", "authors": ["Michael MHaglund", "Daryl WHochman"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01243.x"}

CD31 showed an increase in vascular proliferation at the periphery of proliferative epithelial lesions, but not in non-proliferative lesions.

Our prospective study included 130 patients, aged 9 months to 12 years, who underwent distal hypospadias repair using tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU), from January 2001 through January 2006. Patients were assigned to one of two groups by a computer-generated random selection: 65 patients underwent non-covered urethroplasty (NCU group); another group of 65 patients underwent covered urethroplasty (CU group) with a vascularized subcutaneous ventral flap. The results were evaluated by two pediatric surgeons unaware of the type of treatment each patient had undergone. Successful results were achieved in 99/130 patients (76.2%). We recorded 31 (23.8%) post-operative complications: 20 patients presented with a urethrocutaneous fistula (15 patients in the NCU group and 5 in the CU group); five with urethral stenosis (3 in the NCU and 2 in the CU group); and six with skin dehiscence of the preputioplasty (3 patients in each group). We analyzed the results using the chi2 test and the only statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05) was in terms of incidence of fistulas. Urethrocutaneous fistulas seem to be the most frequent complication of distal hypospadias after TIPU repair. Urethral coverage should be part of the Snodgrass procedure because it significantly reduces the formation of fistulas.

LeTx is a binary toxin ordinarily secreted by Bacillus anthracis and is composed of two proteins: protective antigen (the binding moiety) and lethal factor (the active moiety). Lethal factor is a protease that cleaves and inactivates MKKs.\nIn vitro, treatment of vGPCR-SVEC with LeTx inhibited MKK signaling, moderately inhibited cell proliferation, and blocked the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar. Treatment with LeTx also blocked the ability of these cells to release several angioproliferative cytokines, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 with U0126 caused a substantial inhibition of proliferation but only modestly inhibited VEGF release. In xenograft models, i.v. injection of LeTx caused reduced tumor growth characterized immunohistochemically by inhibition of MKK signaling, decreased rates of proliferation, and reduced levels of VEGF and VEGF receptor 2, with a corresponding decrease in vascular density.\nThese data support a role for MKK signaling in tumor growth and vascularization and are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of MKK signaling by LeTx or a similar agent may be an effective strategy for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma as well as other vascular tumors.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2007-10-03", "authors": ["PhilippeDepeille", "John JYoung", "Elissa ABoguslawski", "Bree DBerghuis", "Eric JKort", "James HResau", "Arthur EFrankel", "Nicholas SDuesbery"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0732"}

We explored whether MCAO leads to hypoxia, changes in vessel density, and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ and adjacent striatum, and determined the relation between the migrating neuroblasts and the vasculature.\nAdult rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO. Hypoxia was studied by injecting Hypoxyprobe-1 during MCAO or 6 weeks later. Vessel density and length was estimated using stereology. New cells were labeled with 5'-bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) during weeks 1 and 2 or 7 and 8 after MCAO, and angiogenesis was assessed immunohistochemically with antibodies against BrdU and endothelial cell markers. Distance from neuroblasts to nearest vessel was measured using confocal microscopy.\nThe ischemic insult caused transient hypoxia and early, low-grade angiogenesis, but no damage or increase of vascular density in the SVZ. Angiogenesis was detected during the first 2 weeks in the dorsomedial striatum adjacent to the SVZ, which also showed long-lasting increase of vascularization. At 2, 6, and 16 weeks after MCAO, the majority of neuroblasts migrated through this area toward the damage, closely associated with blood vessels.\nThe vasculature plays an important role for long-term striatal neurogenesis after stroke. During several months, neuroblasts migrate close to blood vessels through an area exhibiting early vascular remodeling and persistently increased vessel density.

To maintain sustained delivery and improve its therapeutic efficacy, IL-1Ra was encapsulated with stabilizers in biodegradable poly-(lactic/glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres. In vitro cytokine release and bioactivity studies in cultured melanoma B16 cells revealed the microspheres to be capable of sustained IL-1Ra release on a daily level that could inhibit cell proliferation for at least 7 days. The level of IL-1Ra released from the microspheres was revealed in rat serum. Significant amounts of IL-1Ra were released over the course of 2 weeks, at levels sufficient for the inhibition of exogenously-administered IL-1 beta. In mice injected with B16 melanoma cells, the sustained IL-1Ra delivery from biodegradable microspheres inhibited tumor growth and significantly prolonged mice survival. Furthermore, the tumors were less vascularized and after amputation of the primary tumor, the number of lung metastases was reduced by 70%, as compared to the control groups. Thus, we show that biodegradable microspheres represent an efficient system for sustaining IL-1Ra delivery and improving its therapeutic efficacy.

Despite enormous insights into tumor angiogenesis in solid tumors, little is known about the time-course-dependent properties of tumor vascularization in hematologic malignancies. The aim of this study was to establish a model of myeloid leukemia, which allows long-term monitoring of tumor progression and associated microcirculation. Red fluorescent protein-transduced human leukemic cell lines (M-07e) were implanted into cranial windows of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Intravital microscopy was performed over 55 days to measure functional (microvascular permeability, tissue perfusion rate and leukocyte-endothelium interactions) and morphological vascular parameters (vessel density, distribution and diameter). Tumor progression was associated with elevated microvascular permeability and an initial angiogenic wave followed by decreased vessel density combined with reduced tissue perfusion due to loss in small vessels and development of heterogenous tumor vascularization. Following altered geometric resistance of microcirculation, leukocyte-endothelium interactions were more frequent without increased leukocyte extravasation. It was concluded that time-dependent alterations of leukemic tumor vascularization exhibit strong similarities to those found in solid tumors.

We compared the signal intensity of the graft with the intensity of the ipsilateral proximal femoral diaphysis and assigned a score of 1 if less than diaphysis, 2 if equal to diaphysis and 3 if greater than diaphysis. We defined graft failure as conversion to or on the waiting list for total hip arthroplasty.\nThirty percent of hips failed treatment (n = 31, mean graft survival 34.9 mo), while 70% of grafts were retained (n = 73, mean follow-up 56.6 mo). Bone scan scores were significantly lower in the failed group (mean 7.1, range 6-12), compared with the retained group (mean 8.5, range 6-18; p = 0.03).

In the current study, a mouse model of colon cancer, Apc(Min/+), with an additional deficiency of uPA (Apc(Min/+)/Plau-/-) was used to determine the effects of uPA on tumour initiation and growth. Utilizing this model, it was found that the number of tumours was diminished in these mice relative to Apc(Min/+) mice, which correlated with the decreased leukocyte infiltration in the tumours. However, tumour growth was not impeded in Apc(Min/+)/Plau-/- mice, and proliferation and tumour vascularization were, in fact, enhanced in Apc(Min/+)/Plau-/- mice. These latter effects are consistent with a mechanism involving up-regulation of COX-2 expression and Akt pathway activation in Apc(Min/+)/Plau-/- mice.

The NGR peptide on the surface of liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) targets an aminopeptidase N (CD13) isoform, specific to the tumor neovasculature, making it a promising strategy. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of action, we investigated cell binding, kinetics of internalization as well as cytotoxicity of TVT-DOX in vitro. We demonstrate the specific binding of TVT-DOX to CD13-expressing endothelial [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Kaposi sarcoma-derived endothelial cells (SLK)] and tumor (fibrosarcoma, HT-1080) cells in vitro. Following binding, the drug was shown to internalize through the endosomal pathway, eventually leading to the localization of doxorubicin in cell nuclei. TVT-DOX showed selective toxicity toward CD13-expressing HUVEC, sparing the CD13-negative colon-cancer cells, HT-29. Additionally, the nontargeted counterpart of TVT-DOX, Caelyx, was less cytotoxic to the CD13-positive HUVECs demonstrating the advantages of NGR targeting in vitro. The antitumor activity of TVT-DOX was tested in nude mice bearing human prostate-cancer xenografts (PC3). A significant growth inhibition (up to 60%) of PC3 tumors in vivo was observed. Reduction of tumor vasculature following treatment with TVT-DOX was also apparent. We further compared the efficacies of TVT-DOX and free doxorubicin in the DOX-resistant colon-cancer model, HCT-116, and observed the more pronounced antitumor effects of the TVT-DOX formulation over free DOX.

{"title": "[Usefulness of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma].", "abstract": "Thyroid nodules are found in the vast majority of the population, but only 5 to 10% are malignant. Ultrasonography of the thyroid, by virtue of being a straightforward, non-invasive method presenting strong correlation with macroscopic aspects of the thyroid gland, is being increasingly used to identify nodules that present a higher risk of malignancy. The presence of certain ultrasonographic characteristics such as hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular contours and central vascularization on Doppler, increase the risk of the lesion being malignant. Conversely, nodules presenting benign ultrasonographic characteristics such as hyperechogenicity and a mixed sponge-like aspect, and a concordant cytology, have a negative predictive value of 96.6%. It is, thus, important to examine all nodular lesions and to identify suspicious lesions that need biopsy, especially in multinodular glands. Ultrasonography is also highly sensitive in the identification of suspicious cervical lymph nodes during the follow-up of patients with thyroid carcinoma, even when PCI is negative and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels are undetectable. Tg measurement in the needle wash-out content is recommended as this has proven to be more sensitive than cytology in the diagnosis of cervical metastasis, especially where there is liquid content, and it is not affected by the presence of anti-Tg antibodies.", "journal": "Arquivos brasileiros de endocrinologia e metabologia", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["Rosalinda Y A deCamargo", "Eduardo KiyoshiTomimori"], "doi": "10.1590/s0004-27302007000500016"}

The relative area of the yolk sac (YS), chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and their precursor, the area opaca vasculosa (AV) was used to characterize developmental phases. During Phase 1, only the AV was present; development was characterized by differentiation with little increase in the size of the embryo. During Phase 2, the vascularized YS and CAM grew from about 10 to 100% coverage of the surface of the shell during a period of about two weeks. Differentiation and growth of the embryo were accordingly rapid. During Phase 3, the YS and CAM were fixed in size and the remainder of development was relatively slow.

{"title": "Automated immunofluorescence analysis defines microvessel area as a prognostic parameter in clear cell renal cell cancer.", "abstract": "Microvessel density (MVD) has been reported to have prognostic relevance for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, this finding is controversial because of the difficulty of MVD evaluation in this complex vascularized tumor type. The present study evaluates the use of an automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system for objective and reproducible determination of tumor vascularization in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The AQUA system was applied to tissue microarrays with 284 primary ccRCC tumors. To determine angiogenesis in ccRCC, we created an epithelial/stromal mask consisting of CD10, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin to distinguish epithelial tumor cells from CD34-positive endothelial cells. Using immunofluorescence and computer-aided quantification of CD34 expression, we measured the relative microvessel area (MVA) and compared the MVA to the manually counted MVD. The MVA determined by AQUA in a test set with 209 ccRCCs ranged from 0% to 30.3% (mean +/- SD, 10.1% +/- 6.3%). The manually determined MVD ranged from 6 to 987 vessels/mm(2) (416.8 +/- 252.8 vessels/mm(2)). MVA and MVD were significantly correlated (P < .001). A larger MVA was associated with histologic grade (P < .001), tumor stage (P =.008), presence of metastasis (P = .005), presence of sarcomatoid areas (P < .001), and tumor-specific survival (P < .001). Using MVA as defined in the test set, all associations with clinical and pathologic parameters were confirmed in a second independent validation set. MVA determination by AQUA is an objective and reliable method to quantify tumor vascularization in ccRCC. A large MVA correlates with a high MVD and is associated with better patient prognosis.", "journal": "Human pathology", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["Kirsten DMertz", "FrancescaDemichelis", "RobertKim", "PeterSchraml", "MartinaStorz", "Pierre-Andr\u00e9Diener", "HolgerMoch", "Mark ARubin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.humpath.2007.05.017"}
{"title": "Villitis of unknown etiology: noninfectious chronic villitis in the placenta.", "abstract": "Villitis of unknown etiology (VUE) is an important pattern of placental injury occurring predominantly in term placentas. Although overlapping with infectious villitis, its clinical and histologic characteristics are distinct. It is a common lesion, affecting 5% to 15% of all placentas. When low-grade lesions affecting less than 10 villi per focus are excluded, VUE is an important cause of intrauterine growth restriction and recurrent reproductive loss. Involvement of large fetal vessels in the placenta (obliterative fetal vasculopathy) in cases of VUE is a strong risk factor for neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy. Although the etiology of the eliciting antigen is unknown, many other characteristics of the immune response have been clarified. VUE is caused by maternal T lymphocytes, predominantly CD8-positive, that inappropriately gain access to the villous stroma. Fetal antigen-presenting cells (Hofbauer cells) expand and are induced to express class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. Maternal monocyte-macrophages in the perivillous space likely amplify the immune response. Although much speculation exists that VUE represents a host-versus-graft reaction analogous to transplant rejection, other eliciting antigens have not been excluded. Irrespective of target antigen or antigens, the pathophysiologic implications of having activated maternal lymphocytes within vascularized fetal tissues are not trivial.", "journal": "Human pathology", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["Raymond WRedline"], "doi": "10.1016/j.humpath.2007.05.025"}

{"title": "Role of Shigella infection in endometriosis: a novel hypothesis.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial cells and stroma at ectopic sites outside the uterine cavity. The natural history of endometriosis is uncertain, its etiology unknown, the clinical presentation inconsistent, diagnosis difficult and the treatment poorly standardized. It causes significant morbidity due to pelvic pain and infertility among 15-25% of women during their reproductive age. The benign disease causes peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cysts but displays features of malignancy, like neo-vascularization, local invasion and distant metastasis. Mechanical, hormonal, immunological, environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology but provide inconclusive explanations. Present study was carried out on ectopic and eutopic endometriotic tissue specimens collected during laproscopy/laprotomy from cases of endometriosis. mRNA was isolated from the tissues and converted to cDNA by RT and subsequently subjected to differential display Polymerase Chain Reaction using seven sets of arbitrary primers. A unique band was identified only in the ectopic endometriotic tissue, which was sequenced. BLAST search results revealed sequence homology to shigella bacterial DNA leading us to hypothesize that infection may be playing a role in the etiology of endometriosis. This is the first report implicating the role of bacterial infection in the etiology of endometriosis. Shigella is known to invade the mucosa of the colon through the feco-oral route causing Shigellosis. The pathogenesis of shigellosis involves inflammation, ulceration, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrosis of the colonic mucosa resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhoea/dysentery, this is similar to the pathogenesis of endometriosis which also involves inflammation, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrotic adhesions of the pelvic peritoneum resulting in abdominal pain and infertility. The non-motile shigella bacteria invade the deeper mucosal layers by travelling from cell to cell of colonic epithelium, reaching the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa. We propose that, by the same mechanism, the bacteria travel across the colon wall to reach the outer peritoneal surface of the colon, which is in close proximity to the posterior uterine surface in the Pouch of Douglas, the site which incidentally happens to be the commonest site of early endometriosis. Our hypothesis therefore proposes that shigella or shigella-like organisms may be the trigger for the initiation of immunological changes in the pelvic peritoneum causing endometriosis. Once the endometrial cells are implanted at ectopic sites they are sustained by hormones and angiogenic factors. Hence \"Infection hypothesis\" provides a novel explanation for the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["V LKodati", "SGovindan", "SMovva", "SPonnala", "QHasan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.06.012"}

In recent years, research has shown that stem cells from a variety of sources can be used as a tool to study and prevent the events that lead to stroke. In this regard, a population of adult stem cells, called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), have been identified in peripheral blood and may play an important role in tissue vascularization and endothelium homeostasis in the adult. Most of the studies on EPCs have been carried out on patients with cardiovascular diseases; however, there is emerging evidence which suggests that the introduction or mobilization of EPCs can restore tissue vascularization even after cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), such as ischemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage.

In this work, recombinant human fibronectin-derived low-molecular-weight peptide fragments were studied for their ability to promote cell type-specific alpha(4) integrin-mediated adhesion. Two populations of primary human endothelial cells were examined and found to express alpha(4) integrin receptors on their surfaces; on the contrary, human platelets were not found to be expressers of alpha(4) integrins. A peptide fragment isolated from the variably spliced human fibronectin type III connecting segment-1 (CS-1) domain was determined to mediate statistically significant endothelial cell alpha(4) integrin-mediated adhesion. In contrast, the fibronectin type III CS-1 fragment did not support human platelet adhesion under physiological fluid shear conditions, although fully intact human fibronectin molecules supported shear-induced platelet adhesion. This suggests that platelets bind to fibronectin in regions not encompassing the CS-1 domain. In conclusion, this work has demonstrated that the low-molecular-weight peptide CS-1 could serve as a cell-selective adhesion mediator in the engineering of a more-compatible small-caliber vascular graft lumen interface.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-09-22", "authors": ["Eric JRodenberg", "Fredrick MPavalko"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2007.0037"}

Embedding UVSMC cultured in medium containing 10% FBS had an adverse effect on subsequently seeded HUVEC junction morphology; HUVEC/UVSMC co-culturing was done in HUVEC medium (2% FBS with the addition of 0.03 mg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement) as compared to HUVEC seeded on collagen-only modules. In contrast, embedding UVSMC cultured in serum-free medium prior to embedding improved EC junction morphology. Such serum-free culturing, also prevented the UVSMC induced contraction of the collagen modules. On the other hand, embedding serum-free cultured UVSMC promoted HUVEC proliferation and NO secretion compared to those modules embedded with 10% serum cultured UVSMC. These results suggest, not surprisingly, that embedded UVSMC phenotype plays an important role in the seeded HUVEC phenotype, and that the response can be modulated by the UVSMC culture medium serum concentration.

In the absence of a vascular network, the cells in a large spheroid size experience mass transfer limitations of metabolites and oxygen in the core of aggregates. In this paper transport phenomena related to the diffusion and reaction of oxygen, glucose and lactate are mathematically described and experimentally verified for hepatocyte spheroids cultured in a rotating-wall polystyrene system (RWPS) not permeable for gases and in a rotating-wall membrane system (RWMS) with oxygen-permeable membrane. The concentration profiles of glucose, oxygen and lactate in the hepatocyte spheroids were estimated for different diameters of aggregates by solving the mass transfer equations for simultaneous diffusion and reaction, by finite element method. Simulation results evidenced that, for aggregates with size lower than 300 microm cultured in both RWPS and RWMS systems, the concentration profiles of glucose and lactate towards the core of spheroids (effective diffusion coefficients in the order of 10(-11)m(2)/s) are not significantly affected by the metabolic rate (c.a 10(-6)microg/mm(3)/s for glucose and about one order of magnitude less for lactate). On the contrary, the transport of oxygen (diffusion coefficient: 3.4 x 10(-10)m(2)/s, reaction rate: 1.5 x 10(-5)microg/mm(3)/s) is critically affected by the size of the multicellular spheroids and significant gradients in oxygen concentration may develop in spheroids. Aggregates with a size greater than 200 microm suffer severe oxygen limitation in the most part of its size attaining the lowest partial pressure in the centre. The improved viability predicted by the model culturing hepatocyte spheroids in the RWMS, characterized by a higher O(2) permeability with respect to RWPS, was experimentally confirmed.

Here, the performance of keratinocyte cultures depends primarily on the quality of the bed to which they are applied. Clinical take rates for cultured keratinocyte grafts are optimal when applied to a vascularized dermal bed with minimal bacterial colonization. In the absence of autologous dermis, staged reconstruction with a dermal equivalent or dermal regeneration template is required. A novel product, Hyalomatrix, is a bilayer of an esterified hyaluronan scaffold beneath a silicone membrane. The scaffold delivers hyaluronan to the wound bed, and the silicone membrane acts as a temporary epidermal barrier. The product has been investigated in a controlled, porcine, acute full-thickness excisional wound model. Cultured autologous keratinocytes (CAKs) were delivered on Laserskin to acute full-thickness wounds treated with Hyalomatrix within chambers, and graft take rates were assessed longitudinally using image analysis. In the absence of chambers, wound contraction was assessed. Clinical CAK take rates fall sequentially with delay in application post-Hyalomatrix pre-treatment, but repeated pre-treatment removed this, with maximal take of 57.2% at 5 weeks post-wounding. In the absence of chambers, more-complete wound closure resulted from edge re-epithelialization and contraction, by a factor of 5 at 1 month, and was achieved at least 2 weeks sooner in the gold standard controls of split-thickness autograft to an acute or pre-treated wound bed. Wound contraction and late neodermal morphology (1 year) were similar in pre-treated CAKs and split-thickness autograft wounds. In this model, the Hyalomatrix wound bed pre-treatment increase in CAK take appeared to be dose dependent. The product appeared to act as a hyaluronan delivery system rather than a dermal regeneration template. The silicone membrane may limit wound bed colonization, and the combination of this temporary barrier with hyaluronan delivery and neodermis induction has been termed a barrier-delivery-induction system. The development of similar systems for serial application offers an alternative to a dermal regeneration template when CAKs are engrafted in the hostile, colonized environment of large burn wounds.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-09-21", "authors": ["Simon RMyers", "Vaiude NPartha", "CarloSoranzo", "Richard DPrice", "Harshad ANavsaria"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2007.0109"}

We report that CD4+ T(EM) (CD45RO+ CCR7- CD62L-) can be adoptively transferred readily into C.B-17 SCID/bg mice and mediate the destruction of human endothelial cells (EC) in vascularized human skin grafts allogeneic to the T cell donor. In contrast, CD4+ T(CM) (CD45RO+ CCR7+ CD62L+) are inefficiently transferred and do not mediate EC injury. In vitro, CD4+ T(EM) secrete more IFN-gamma within 48 h in response to allogeneic ECs than do T(CM). In contrast, T(EM) and T(CM) secrete comparable amounts of IFN-gamma in response to allogeneic monocytes (Mo). In the same cultures, both T(EM) and T(CM) produce IL-2 and proliferate in response to IFN-gamma-treated allogeneic human EC or Mo, but T(CM) respond more vigorously in both assays. Blockade of LFA-3 strongly inhibits both IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion by CD4+ T(EM) cultured with allogeneic EC but only minimally inhibits responses to allogeneic Mo. Blockade of CD80 and CD86 strongly inhibits IL-2 but not IFN-gamma production by in response to allogeneic EC or Mo. Transduction of EC to express B7-2 enhances allogeneic T(EM) production of IL-2 but not IFN-gamma. We conclude that human CD4+ T(EM) directly recognize and respond to allogeneic EC in vitro by secreting IFN-gamma and that this response depends on CD2 but not CD28. Consistent with EC activation of effector functions, human CD4+ T(EM) can mediate allogeneic EC injury in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2007-09-20", "authors": ["Stephen LShiao", "Nancy CKirkiles-Smith", "Benjamin RShepherd", "Jennifer MMcNiff", "Edward JCarr", "Jordan SPober"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4397"}

We can define substernal--or retrosternal-goiter a thyroid formation with cervical departure that goes beyond the superior thoracic strait for at least 3 cm and that preserves, generally, the connections between the cervical and thoracic portion, maintaining a direct vascularization supplied by the thyroid arteries. The \"forgotten\" goiter is an extremely rare disease: a mediastinic thyroid mass found after total thyroidectomy.\n595 patients with thyroid pathology have been treated surgically in our Department. Fifty (8.4%) of these were suffered from a cervico-mediastinic goiter. The diagnosis has been confirmed by the thyroid ecotomography, by the radiologic examination of the chest, by the neck-chest CT examination, by the MR of the mediastinum and by the thyroid scintigraphy.\nThe surgical treatment, in retrosternal goiters, is related to the experiences of surgeons. For the majority of the surgeons almost all antero-superior mediastinal goiters can be removed across a cervicotomy, only in few cases in association with a sternal split. In our experience the cervical approach is the only surgical access used for all the patients. The complication rate following substernal goiter resection is higher than the average rate for cervical thyroidectomy. However, in our series we did not observed permanent recurrential lesions, only in one case a light hypophonia has been observed.

The circulatory function of the placenta appears at an early stage of embryo-placental development and it is strongly related to fetal growth, to the placental size and to uterine and umbilical blood flows. Therefore, an adequate placental angiogenesis is critical for the establishment of a normal placental vascularization with consequent normal development of the fetus.

We used differentiating stem-cell cultures (embryoid bodies) and teratomas to show that FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) exerts a negative regulatory effect on endothelial cell function in these models. Embryoid bodies lacking expression of FGFR-1 as a result of gene targeting (Fgfr-1(-/-)) displayed increased vascularization and a distinct, elongated vessel morphology. Teratomas derived from FGFR-1-deficient stem cells were characterized by an increased growth rate and abundant, morphologically distinct vessels. Transmission electron microscopy of the Fgfr-1(-/-) teratomas showed a compact and voluminous but functional endothelium, which anastomosed with the host circulation. The increased vascularization and altered endothelial cell morphology was dependent on secreted factor(s), based on the transfer of the Fgfr-1(-/-) vascular phenotype by conditioned medium to Fgfr-1(+/-) embryoid bodies. Antibody and transcript arrays showed down-regulation of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and up-regulation of pleiotrophin in Fgfr-1(-/-) embryoid bodies, compared with the heterozygous cultures.

Formation of the secondary ossification center was initiated by cartilage canal formation and blood vessel invasion at 7 days of age, and onset of ossification was observed at 14 days. In situ hybridization showed that CCN2/CTGF mRNA was distinctively expressed in the region of the cartilage canal and capsule-attached marginal tissues at 7 days of age, and distinct expression was also observed in proliferating chondrocytes around the marrow space at 14 days of age. Immunostaining showed that CCN2/CTGF was distributed broadly around the expressed cells located in the central region of the epiphysis, where the chondrocytes become hypertrophic and the cartilage canal enters into the hypertrophic mass. Furthermore, an overlapping distribution of metalloproteinase (MMP)9 and CCN2/CTGF was found in the secondary ossification center.

{"title": "Mechanism of decongestant activity of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists.", "abstract": "The vascular bed in nasal mucosa of different species, including human, is highly vascularized and an extensive sinusoidal network of large capacitance vessels is present deep within the submucosa. When this network of venous sinusoids is engorged with blood, the swollen mucosa reduces the size of the airway lumen and congestion ensues. Nasal vasculature tone is strongly influenced by the sympathetic nervous system and the only drugs approved specifically to relieve vascular nasal obstruction are alpha-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic agents. Due to their vasoconstrictor action, the sympathomimetic decongestants oppose vasodilation, reducing nasal airway resistance and thus facilitating nose breathing. However, standard decongestants that are non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are associated with the potential for side-effect liabilities including hypertension, stroke, insomnia and nervousness. We propose than a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, by acting preferentially on nasal venous capacitance vessels, will elicit decongestion with a reduced side-effect liability. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920 in a real-time tissue contractility assay using isolated pig nasal explants and in an in vivo cat model of congestion. The vasoconstrictor and decongestant effects of BHT-920 were compared to the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist epinephrine and the standard decongestant oxymetazoline. Our results showed that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920 preferentially contracts venous sinusoids confirming previous observations [Corboz MR, Varty LM, Rivelli MA, Mutter JC, Mingo G, McLeod R, et al.

Constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and overexpression of VEGF are common denominators of tumors from different origins. We have established a new link between these two fundamental observations converging on VEGF mRNA stability. In this complex phenomenon, tristetraprolin (TTP), an adenylate and uridylate-rich element-associated protein that binds to VEGF mRNA 3'-untranslated region, plays a key role by inducing VEGF mRNA degradation, thus maintaining basal VEGF mRNA amounts in normal cells. ERKs activation results in the accumulation of TTP mRNA. However, ERKs reduce the VEGF mRNA-destabilizing effect of TTP, leading to an increase in VEGF expression that favors the angiogenic switch. Moreover, TTP decreases RasVal12-dependent VEGF expression and development of vascularized tumors in nude mice. As a consequence, TTP might represent a novel antiangiogenic and antitumor agent acting through its destabilizing activity on VEGF mRNA.

Normalized contrast concentrations at day 14 in transplanted islets were increased relative with that on day 3. Time to peak contrast enhancement was faster by 12 min at day 14 compared to day 3 islets (while kidney and muscle peak times remained the same). Areas under the curve for contrast concentration versus time plots were larger in 14-day relative to 3-day islet grafts. In conclusion, noninvasive assessment of neovascularization is achievable. In vivo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can be used to detect and quantify changes in vascularization following islet transplantation.

{"title": "From scrawny to brawny: the quest for neomusculogenesis; smart surfaces and scaffolds for muscle tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The successful generation of functional muscle tissues requires both an in-depth knowledge of muscle tissue physiology and advanced engineering practices. The inherent contractile functionality of muscle is a result of its high-level cellular and matrix organization over a multitude of length scales. While there have been many attempts to produce artificial muscle, a method to fabricate a highly organized construct, comprised of multiple cell types and capable of delivering contractile strengths similar to that of native smooth, skeletal or cardiac muscle has remained elusive. This is largely due to a lack of control over phenotype and spatial organization of cells. This paper covers state-of-the-art approaches to generating both 2D and 3D substrates that provide some form of higher level organization or multiple biochemical, mechanical or electrical cues to cells in order to successfully manipulate their behavior, in a manner that is conducive to the production of contractile muscle tissue. These so-called 'smart surfaces' and 'smart scaffolds' represent vital steps towards surface-engineered substrates for the engineering of muscle tissues, showing confidently that cellular behavior can be effectively and reproducibly manipulated through the design of the physical, chemical and electrical properties of the substrates on which cells are grown. However, many challenges remain to be overcome prior to reaching the ultimate goal of fully functional 3D vascularized engineered muscle.", "journal": "Expert review of medical devices", "date": "2007-09-14", "authors": ["Andrew SRowlands", "James EHudson", "Justin JCooper-White"], "doi": "10.1586/17434440.4.5.709"}

{"title": "Design, morphometry and development of the secondary osteonal system in the femoral shaft of the rabbit.", "abstract": "The architecture of the diaphyseal bone is closely correlated with the cortical vessel network, whose pattern develops in the course of growth. Various methods have been applied to clarify the three-dimensional anatomy of the cortical canal system, but there is still disagreement about the geometry, blood supply, flux dynamics and factors controlling canal geometry during bone growth and remodeling. A modification of the currently employed dye-injection method was applied to study the vessel network of the whole hemi-shaft of the rabbit femur in mature bones (8-month-old rabbits) and growing bones (1.5-month-old rabbits). The cortical vascular tree of the hemi-shaft of the femur was injected with black China ink and observed in full-thickness specimens of the cortex. The same specimens were then processed for histology. A comparative study of the middle diaphysis (mid-shaft) with the distal extremity (distal shaft) was performed in both young and old rabbit femurs. The longitudinally oriented pattern of the vessel network was seen to develop in the diaphysis of mature femurs, while at the extremity of the shaft of the same specimen the network showed a reticular organization without a dominant polarization. The vessels were significantly higher in the mid-shaft than in the distal shaft of the old femurs (P < 0.0001), as was their diameter (P < 0.05). In the group of young rabbits at mid-shaft level the longitudinally oriented pattern of the vessel network was not yet completely developed, without their being significant differences in length and diameter between the mid-shaft and distal shaft. The differentiation of the mid-shaft from the distal shaft was confirmed histologically by the presence, in the latter, of longitudinal calcified cartilage septa between osteons. This pattern of structural organization and development of the intracortical vascular network has not been previously reported. The cells primarily involved in polarization of the remodeling process were the osteoclasts at the top of the cutting cones advancing from the proximal and distal metaphyses toward the mid-shaft. This suggests, first, a relationship with the longitudinally oriented structures already present in the cortex near the metaphysis (the calcified cartilage septa) and then with the columns of interosteonic breccia, which were formed as a secondary effect of the longitudinal polarization of the remodeling process. Our observations did not enable us to substantiate the model of two different systems, one of longitudinal vessels (Havers) and the other of connecting transversal vessels (Volkmann), but suggested instead that there is a network whose loops lengthen in the direction of the major bone axis in the course of growth and secondary modeling.

{"title": "Automatic segmentation of 3D micro-CT coronary vascular images.", "abstract": "Although there are many algorithms available in the literature aimed at segmentation and model reconstruction of 3D angiographic images, many are focused on characterizing only a part of the vascular network. This study is motivated by the recent emerging prospects of whole-organ simulations in coronary hemodynamics, autoregulation and tissue oxygen delivery for which anatomically accurate vascular meshes of extended scale are highly desirable. The key requirements of a reconstruction technique for this purpose are automation of processing and sub-voxel accuracy. We have designed a vascular reconstruction algorithm which satisfies these two criteria. It combines automatic seeding and tracking of vessels with radius detection based on active contours. The method was first examined through a series of tests on synthetic data, for accuracy in reproduced topology and morphology of the network and was shown to exhibit errors of less than 0.5 voxel for centerline and radius detections, and 3 degrees for initial seed directions. The algorithm was then applied on real-world data of full rat coronary structure acquired using a micro-CT scanner at 20 microm voxel size. For this, a further validation of radius quantification was carried out against a partially rescanned portion of the network at 8 microm voxel size, which estimated less than 10% radius error in vessels larger than 2 voxels in radius.", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "date": "2007-09-11", "authors": ["JackLee", "PatriciaBeighley", "ErikRitman", "NicolasSmith"], "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2007.06.012"}

This study combined biophysical and bioactive approaches to induce neovascularization in vivo. Further, we tested the effects of engineered vascularization on adipose tissue grafts. Hydrogel cylinders were fabricated from poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG) in four configurations: PEG alone, PEG with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), microchanneled PEG, or both bFGF-adsorbed and microchanneled PEG. In vivo implantation revealed no neovascularization in PEG, but substantial angiogenesis in bFGF-adsorbed and/or microchanneled PEG. The infiltrating host tissue consisted of erythrocyte-filled blood vessels lined by endothelial cells, and immunolocalized to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Human mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated into adipogenic cells, and encapsulated in PEG with both microchanneled and adsorbed bFGF. Upon in vivo implantation subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice, oil red O positive adipose tissue was present and interspersed with interstitial fibrous (IF) capsules. VEGF was immunolocalized in the IF capsules surrounding the engineered adipose tissue.

The first clinical symptoms appeared 28 days post-inoculation (dpi), with bovine type II collagen, with an average arthritic index of 1.00 +/- 0.48 corresponding to erythema of the articulation. The disease progressed, and by 70 dpi showed an average arthritic index of 3.83 +/- 0.27 corresponding to edema and maximum deformation, with ankylosis. Computed morphometry demonstrated that, in comparison to controls, the induction of CIA, produces a significant and increasing accumulation of inflammatory cells, fibrosis (p < 0.0001) and cartilage destruction (p = 0.0029). Likewise, the area of von Willebrand factor (vWF) immunostaining, as an indicator of endothelial proliferation, increased significantly from 28 dpi (p < 0.0001), in CIA mice compared to controls. However, the effective synovial vascularization, calculated as the synovial vascular bed area index, significantly increased by 42 dpi (p = 0.0014). This indicates that the activation and proliferation of endothelium becomes significant before an effective vascularization area is formed. The apoptosis index was also an earlier indicator of cartilage damage, becoming significant from 28 dpi in comparison to controls (p < 0.0001). Finally, it was observed that the increase in the arthritic index showed a strong correlation with the increase in both angiogenesis (r = 0.95; p = 0.0021) and apoptosis (r = 0.90; p = 0.0015).

Rat myoblasts were cultured, suspended in fibrin gel, and implanted within silicone chambers around the femoral vessels and transected femoral nerve of syngeneic rats for 4 weeks. Neurotized constructs generated contractile forces 5 times as high as the non-neurotized controls. Indirect stimulation via the nerve elicited contractions of neurotized constructs.

The current procedure involves incorporating the lower pole of the breast and rotating it superiorly. The lateral breast flap is then advanced medially and plicated. This essentially (1) autoaugments the upper pole, (2) narrows the wide breast, (3) provides an internal sling, and (4) redefines and secures the inframammary fold.\nThirty-five patients were included in the series.

Marmosets were given an injection of VEGF antagonist, the VEGF Trap on Day 5 of the follicular phase and ovaries were evaluated on Day 10 or 15. Ovaries from controls were assessed on Day 5 (time of selection), Day 10 (peri-ovulatory) and Day 15 (luteal phase). At Day 10, ovaries of four of the five controls contained dominant follicles, while one had ovulated. VEGF Trap-treated ovaries also contained large follicles on Day 10, but VEGF inhibition had suppressed endothelial cell proliferation, leading to reductions in the thecal vascularization and plasma estradiol relative to controls. By Day 15, ovaries of controls contained active corpora lutea whereas ovaries of four of the five treated animals still contained large antral follicles similar in size to pre-ovulatory follicles, and one had small, avascular corpora lutea. However, these follicles had a restricted vasculature, increased incidence of activated caspase-3 staining and morphological features indicating they would become degenerative non-functional cysts. These results show that after follicle selection, VEGF is essential for angiogenesis and the generation of healthy ovulatory follicles and corpora lutea, but fluid accumulation can still occur in selected follicles in the absence of VEGF.", "journal": "Molecular human reproduction", "date": "2007-09-07", "authors": ["P DTaylor", "HWilson", "S GHillier", "S JWiegand", "H MFraser"], "doi": "10.1093/molehr/gam056"}

We examined the expression profiles of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Tie-2, a receptor for Ang-1 and Ang-2, in both colorectal adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues, as judged by histology, in order to elucidate their relationships with microvascular density (MVD) and clinicopathologic properties. Higher MVD was associated with a lower degree of differentiation of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of Ang-2 and VEGF was significantly increased in colorectal adenocarcinoma compared to adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.01), and the expression of Ang-2 positively correlated with that of VEGF (r = 0.997, p < 0.01). In contrast, the expression of Ang-1 was lower in adenocarcinoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in Tie-2 expression in both tissues. Moreover, MVD was increased in Ang-2- and VEGF-expressing adenocarcinoma tissues compared to the Ang-2- and VEGF-negative tissues, respectively (p < 0.01). Importantly, MVD was lower in Ang-1-expressing adenocarcinoma tissues relative to Ang-1-negative tissues (p < 0.01). Furthermore, expression of Ang-2 as well as VEGF was significantly up-regulated in colorectal adenocarcinoma with diameters > or = 5 cm or with lymph-node metastases (p < 0.01).

Several analytical methods aimed at quantifying the vascular system in two-dimensional histological sections have been proposed, with very discordant results. In this study we investigated the non-Euclidean geometrical complexity of the two-dimensional microvasculature of normal pituitary glands and pituitary adenomas by quantifying the surface fractal dimension that measures its space-filling property. We found a statistical significant difference between the mean vascular surface fractal dimension estimated in normal versus adenomatous tissues (P = 0.01), normal versus secreting adenomatous tissues (P = 0.0003), and normal versus non-secreting adenomatous tissues (P = 0.047), whereas the difference between the secreting and non-secreting adenomatous tissues was not statistically significant. This study provides the first demonstration that fractal dimension is an objective and valid quantitator of the two-dimensional geometrical complexity of the pituitary gland microvascular network in physiological and pathological states. Further studies are needed to compare the vascular surface fractal dimension estimates in different subtypes of pituitary tumours and correlate them with clinical parameters in order to evaluate whether the distribution pattern of vascular growth is related to a particular state of the pituitary gland.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2007-09-06", "authors": ["AntonioDi Ieva", "FabioGrizzi", "GiorgiaCeva-Grimaldi", "CarloRusso", "PaoloGaetani", "EnricoAimar", "DanielLevi", "PatriziaPisano", "FlavioTancioni", "GiancarloNicola", "ManfredTschabitscher", "NicolaDioguardi", "Riccardo Rodriguez YBaena"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00804.x"}

Ophthalmologic examination showed 20/400 visual acuity in the right eye. Biomicroscopy and intraocular pressure were normal. Fundus examination showed vascularized elevated lesion, associated with serous retinal detachment and hard exudates at the inferior periphery. The lesion was surrounded by extensive area of hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. The macula showed attenuation of the foveal reflex. Ocular ultrasound showed a 2.25 mm height vascularized lesion. Serologic examination, hemogram and thorax RX were normal. PPD was considered strong reactor and tuberculosis was diagnosed after positive BK research. Considering the clinical aspects, the ocular diagnosis was vasoproliferative tumor associated with presumed ocular tuberculosis. Treatment with rifampicin, isoniazide and pyridoxine was started. We decided to treat the ocular tumor with cryotherapy and intravitreal triamcinolone injection (4 mg/ml). After 30 days, serous detachment was smaller and the tumor showed atrophic areas. Fluorescein angiography showed areas of vascular hyperfluorescence with slight extravasation and areas of blocked fluorescence due to RPE hyperplasia. Secondary vasoproliferative tumors are retinal glial proliferations and are associated with many ocular conditions that affect retina and choroid. Because of the great number of associated complications, with important visual loss, vasoproliferative tumors should be treated at the moment of diagnosis. Treatment of choice is cryotherapy. Intravitreal triamcinolone can be used as adjuvant treatment because of its angiogenic properties.

{"title": "Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by cell-permeable dominant negative SOX18 mutants.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis play a key roles in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, and has become an attractive target for anticancer drug development. Though a number of anti-angiogenic agents had entered clinical trials, few of them could reproduce the spectacular results in cancer patients as that had been seen in pre-clinical tumor models. Therefore, exploring novel anti-angiogenic agents is highly deserved. SOX18, a member of the Sry-related HMG box-containing family of transcription factors, is expressed transiently in endothelial cells during the development of blood vessels. And mutations resulting in expression of dominant negative SOX18 have been shown to severely impair the vascular development. Recent research demonstrated that SOX18 is expressed during the initial steps of tumor vascularization and involved in regulation of the expression of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 and the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, allograft tumor growth in mice heterozygous for Ra(Op) (RaOp mice) which express a dominant negative mutant form of SOX18 (SOX18RaOp) that does not interact effectively with the endothelial partner protein MEF2C, was dramatically slower than that of wild-type mice. In this article, we postulate that recombinant cell-permeable dominant negative SOX18 mutants, prepared by fusion with protein transduction domains, would inhibit tumor angiogenesis with high efficiency by impairing endothelial tube formation. If the hypothesis was proved to be practical, the fusion proteins would show promise as single anti-angiogenic agents in cancer therapy.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-05", "authors": ["MinLuo", "Xiao-TongGuo", "WeiYang", "Liang-QiLiu", "Li-WenLi", "Xiao-YanXin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.07.024"}

Dorsal placement of the graft has been recently proposed, allowing the graft to be spread fixed on the tunica albuginea of the corporal bodies overlying the stricture. The dorsal graft is ingenious and represents a useful addition to the surgical armamentarium, since it offers a better chance for graft take than does the spongiosum when the urethra is diseased and poorly vascularized. We developed an additional reconstructive option using tunica vaginalis grafts, placed dorsally, for the treatment of anterior urethral strictures.\nA total of 11 patients with anterior urethral strictures were treated with a tunica vaginalis graft urethroplasty. The surgical technique was done as described by Barbagli. The urethra was dissected from the corpora cavernosa and rotated 180 degrees. The dorsal urethral surface was exposed and fully opened. Both the distal and proximal lumina were calibrated. The tunica vaginalis graft was sutured, splayed and quilted over the corpora cavernosa using 6-0 PDS running stitches. The left side of the urethral mucosa was sutured to the graft using 6-0 PDS sutures. A 18F silicone Foley catheter was inserted at this point. The urethra was rotated back to its original position and sutured laterally to the right side of the graft. At the end of the procedure, the graft was completely covered by the urethra. With a follow-up ranging from 7 weeks to 5 months, all patients were voiding well (uroflowmetry > 14 mL per second).\nThis initial experience in 11 patients indicates that tunica vaginalis dorsal graft urethroplasty may be considered within the reconstructive armamentarium of genitourinary surgeons.", "journal": "International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology", "date": "2007-09-05", "authors": ["Roberto CFoinquinos", "Adriano ACalado", "RaimundoJanio", "AdrianaGriz", "AntonioMacedo", "ValdemarOrtiz"], "doi": "10.1590/s1677-55382007000400011"}

{"title": "MR guided cancer treatment system for an elevated therapeutic index - a macroscopic approach.", "abstract": "Adjuvant therapy for cancer usually refers to surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment to decrease the risk of recurrence. But still, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control is only approximately 6%. The objective of this analysis is to formulate a non-invasive multimodal cancer treatment system related to cancer stem cells and hypoxic fractions of solid tumors, emphasizing MRI monitoring and guidance, to elevate the therapeutic index. Tumor hypoxia is a therapeutic concern since it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs and radiotherapy, where well oxygenated cells requiring one third of the dose of hypoxic cells to achieve a given level of cell killing. Cancer stem cells might be the cause of tumor recurrence, sometimes many years after the appearance of the successful treatment of a primary tumor. Thus, the primary objective of such a treatment system will be to provide sufficient selective toxicity to both kill cancer stem cells and cells of hypoxic fractions of the tumor. Active tumor targeting with the use of liposomally encapsulated drugs is the starting point of the treatment procedure. The system facilitates quality assurance means by MR monitoring of drug accumulation and drug release, in real time. Cavitation involves the nucleation, growth and oscillation of gaseous cavities. Selective drug release and/or hyperthermia are achieved by ultrasound induced cavitation well defined to the tumor region. Hyperthermic effects, increased vascularization and subsequent increase in pO2 levels to hypoxic regions, can be monitored by MRI. MRI monitoring of key physiological parameters facilitates optimization related to approximate real time concomitant treatments, including correct timing and various combinations of drug therapy, hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, ablation, other treatment options, before or after surgery. The likelihood of an improved therapeutic index with the use of such a system seems compelling. Further research related to optimal timing, combinations of responses between liposomally encapsulated drug dosage, ultrasound exposure, hyperthermia, pO2 response time, ionizing radiation fractionation and treatment time, have to be conducted.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-09-04", "authors": ["GunnarMyhr"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2007.06.025"}

It is known that PTx can consistently establish normoglycemic insulin-independent state. Due to the increased use of different PTx models in rats for studying the metabolic function of the transplanted pancreas, reviewing the various techniques in PTx seemed to be necessary. A review of the literature of PTx in rat models showed that different techniques or modifications have been described. Each modification is the result of a change or simplification of three main points: the arterial inflow, the venous outflow, and the management of the exocrine secretory part of the gland. The techniques of PTx vascularization in rats are based on two cardinal models, which include the microsuture and non-suture cuff techniques. In arterial inflow reconstruction, an aortic segment is used. Venous drainage is accomplished by systemic or portal drainage (porto-caval or porto-portal anastomosis). Management of the exocrine part has the most variations. Enteric and urinary diversion, as well as duct ligation or obstruction, are the most important techniques for the management of exocrine part. Regarding vascular anastomosis, the microsuture technique is more popular than the cuff technique. However the cuff technique seems to be simpler. Grafts with portal venous drainage show a lesser probability of hyperinsulinemia and a high level of lipoproteins. In the management of the exocrine part, enteric exocrine drainage is more similar to the physiological setting and is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of acidosis and dehydration. However, enteric diversion is more prone to intestinal bleeding and ileus as well as to bacterial contamination.

The current study has investigated the protective effects of G-2mPE following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the neonatal brain. On postnatal day 7, Wistar rats were exposed to hypoxia-ischemia (HI). HI was induced by unilateral ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia (7.7% O2, 36 degrees C) for 60 min. The drug treatment started 2 h after the insult, and the pups were given either 1.2 mg/kg (bolus), 1.2 mg/ml once a day for 7 days, or vehicle. The degree of brain damage was determined histochemically by thionin/acid fuchsin staining. G-2mPE's anti-inflammatory properties were investigated by IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18 ELISA, and effects on apoptosis by caspase 3 activity. Vascularization was determined immunohistochemically by the total length of isolectin-positive blood vessels. Effect on astrocytosis was also determined in the hippocampus. Animals treated with multiple doses of G-2mPE demonstrated reduced overall brain injury 7 days after HI, particularly in the hippocampus and thalamus compared to vehicle-treated rats. The expression of IL-6 was decreased in G-2mPE-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated pups, and both the capillary length and astrogliosis were increased in the drug-treated animals. There was no effect on caspase 3 activity. This study indicates that peripheral administration of G-2mPE, starting 2 h after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, reduces the degree of brain injury in the immature rat brain.

{"title": "Beta-carotene inhibits tumor-specific angiogenesis by altering the cytokine profile and inhibits the nuclear translocation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels out of the preexisting vascular network and involves a sequence of events that are of key importance in a broad array of physiological and pathological processes. The growth of tumor and metastasis are dependent on the formation of new blood vessels. The present study therefore aims at evaluating the antiangiogenic effect of beta-carotene using in vivo and in vitro models. Male C57BL/6 mice as well as B16F-10 cells were used for the experimental study. The in vivo study includes the inhibitory effect of beta-carotene on the formation of tumor-directed capillaries. Rat aortic ring assay, human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation are used for assessing the in vitro antiangiogenic effect of beta-carotene. The differential regulation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as the inhibitory effect of beta-carotene on the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors are also assessed. Beta-carotene treatment significantly reduces the number of tumor-directed capillaries accompanied by altered serum cytokine levels. Beta-carotene is able to inhibit proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells. Beta-carotene treatment downregulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, prolyl hydroxylase, and lysyl oxidase gene expression and upregulates the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. The study reveals that beta-carotene treatment could alter proinflammatory cytokine production and could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of p65, p50, c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor-kappa B, and other transcription factors such as c-fos, activated transcription factor-2, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein in B16F-10 melanoma cells. These observations show that beta -carotene exerts its antiangiogenic effect by altering the cytokine profile and could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors.", "journal": "Integrative cancer therapies", "date": "2007-09-01", "authors": ["CGuruvayoorappan", "GirijaKuttan"], "doi": "10.1177/1534735407305978"}
{"title": "Reconstruction of functional tissues with cell sheet engineering.", "abstract": "The field of tissue engineering has yielded several successes in early clinical trials of regenerative medicine using living cells seeded into biodegradable scaffolds. In contrast to methods that combine biomaterials with living cells, we have developed an approach that uses culture surfaces grafted with the temperature-responsive polymer poly(N-isoproplyacrylamide) that allows for controlled attachment and detachment of living cells via simple temperature changes. Using cultured cell sheets harvested from temperature-responsive surfaces, we have established cell sheet engineering to create functional tissue sheets to treat a wide range of diseases from corneal dysfunction to esophageal cancer, tracheal resection, and cardiac failure. Additionally, by exploiting the unique ability of cell sheets to generate three-dimensional tissues composed of only cultured cells and their deposited extracellular matrix, we have also developed methods to create thick vascularized tissues as well as, organ-like systems for the heart and liver.

This is largely because of insufficient data on the expression of molecules that impact angiogenesis. Because angiostatin and one of its receptors integrin alphavbeta3 inhibit and promote angiogenesis, respectively, we hypothesized that the normal retina and cornea of domestic animals would express angiostatin but not integrin alphavbeta3.\nNormal eyes of the cat, cow, dog, horse, pig and rat were evaluated for angiostatin and integrin alphavbeta3 by light and electron immunocytochemistry and estern blots.\nAngiostatin was detected in the corneal epithelium of the cat, dog, horse, pig and rat, but was not found in cow corneal epithelium. Angiostatin was localized in the nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner and outer plexiform layers, and the photoreceptor layer of the cat, cow, dog and rat. Horse and pig retinas showed additional staining in the matrix of the inner nuclear layer. Immunogold electron microscopy further confirmed angiostatin in cat retina. Western blots showed angiostatin in corneal and retinal homogenates. Integrin alphavbeta3 was absent in cornea and retina of all the species studied.\nThese data show that angiostatin, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, is present while integrin alphavbeta3, which promotes angiogenesis, is absent in normal cornea and retina of the domestic animals in this study with the exception being angiostatin absence in cow corneal epithelium. Therefore, angiostatin may contribute to the anti-angiogenic environment in the normal domestic animal eye while its absence in the cow may contribute to greater propensity for corneal vascularization. Because integrin alphavbeta3 is one of the receptors for angiostatin, its absence may prevent angiostatin from killing normal retinal and corneal cells.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2007-09-01", "authors": ["Jacqueline WPearce", "Kyathanahalli SJanardhan", "SarahCaldwell", "BaljitSingh"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00560.x"}

A reduction of the cutaneous microvasculature has been observed in the skin of elderly individuals. Human skin is exposed daily to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, infrared rays and heat, and these stimuli are known to induce skin angiogenesis. Interestingly, although acute UV irradiation stimulates skin angiogenesis, cutaneous blood vessels are decreased in chronically photodamaged skin. The reason for the differential effects of acute and chronic UV exposure on skin angiogenesis remains to be elucidated.

{"title": "Dysplasia: a review.", "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common perinatal complication of very low birth weight preterm infants with a significant risk of long-term disability and morbidity. While clinical conditions such as prematurity and mechanical ventilation are its major risk factors, studies suggest that there is an individual susceptibility to BPD. This comprehensive review summarizes data collected about the implication of genetic polymorphisms in BPD and in its risk factors. Some studies have directly related the risk of BPD to genotype. Indeed, carrier states of genetic variants of cytokines (IFNgamma T+874A), adhesion molecules (L-selectin-Pro213Ser), elements of renin-angiotensin system (ACE-I/D), antioxidant enzymes (GST-P1 Val105Ile), and surfactant proteins (SPA1, SPB intron 4) has been identified as risk factors to BPD. Other studies investigated the role of genotype in BPD risk factors. Premature birth has been linked to carrier states of genetic variants with an impact on immune status (such as IL-6 G(-174)C, MBL2 54G/A, VEGF G+405C, HSP72 A+1267G genes) and matrix metalloproteases. Fetal inflammatory response syndrome, a major determinant of BPD is also affected by genotype (including LTalpha A+250G). Disturbed intrauterine lung development and vascularization may also contribute to BPD; these processes may be impaired in the presence of some rare genetic mutations. Furthermore, there is also a genetic component in the susceptibility to other perinatal adaptational disturbances such as respiratory distress syndrome that are associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation, and, hence, with lung damage. The genetic variants presented in this article may help to identify infants at risk for BPD.", "journal": "Pediatric pulmonology", "date": "2007-08-30", "authors": ["G\u00e9zaBokodi", "Andr\u00e1sTreszl", "LajosKov\u00e1cs", "TivadarTulassay", "BarnaV\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi"], "doi": "10.1002/ppul.20689"}

The mean age range was 26 (2 - 42) years. In 6 cases a partial vascularized joint transfer was carried out, with the transplant being harvested in two cases from non-replantable finger according to the \"tissue bank concept\" according to Chase and in the other two cases from the PIP-joint of the second toe. In 10 patients a complete vascularized joint transfer was carried out, with the joint being harvested from the hand in 6 cases and from the 2nd toe in 4 cases. The following criteria were evaluated: active range of motion (neutral-0-method), postoperative arthritis, growth and complications. Active range of motion of the transplanted joint was for partial PIP-joint transfer Ex/Flex 0/20/65 degrees und for partial MP-joint transfer 0/20/30 degrees . After DIP-to-PIP-joint transposition active range of motion was measured Ex/Flex 0/20/60 degrees , after PIP-to-PIP transposition 0/30/60 degrees , PIP-to-MP-transposition 0/20/80 degrees and after MP-to-MP-transposition 0/20/57 degrees .

Human fibroblasts and growth factors were introduced to optimize angiogenesis. A density higher than 4 x 10(4) cells/ml of fibrin was necessary to induce angiogenic-like structures (i.e., sprouting, cord-, lumen-like structures) by 14 days in the dispersed cell model. Endothelial cells on micro-beads also exhibited angiogenic-like structures that were inter-connected to those on neighboring beads. The sizes of the angiogenic-like structures were larger on beads compared to those found in the dispersed cell model.

Long-term success after lung transplantation is severely limited by the development of bronchiolitis obliterans. The murine heterotopic tracheal transplantation model has been widely used for studies investigating pathogenesis of obliterative airway disease and immunosuppressive strategies to prevent its development. Despite its utility, this model employs proximal airway that lacks airflow and is not vascularized. We have developed a novel model of orthotopic vascularized lung transplantation in the mouse, which leads to severe vascular rejection in allogeneic strain combinations. Here we characterize differences in the fate of airway epithelial cells in nonimmunosuppressed heterotopic tracheal and vascularized lung allograft models over 28 days. Up-regulation of growth factors that are thought to be critical for the development of airway fibrosis and interstitial collagen deposition were similar in both models. However, while loss of airway epithelial cells occurred in the tracheal model, airway epithelium remained intact and fully differentiated in lung allografts, despite profound vascular rejection. Moreover, we demonstrate expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in airway epithelial cells of acutely rejected lung allografts. These findings suggest that in addition to alloimmune responses, other stimuli may be required for the destruction of airway epithelial cells.

Porous cylindrical specimens 8x10mm were implanted in the lateral aspect of the tibia of 13 patients (mean age 54 years), during osteotomy surgery for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. Implanted cylinders were retrieved at the same time as the removal of the blade plates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Scanning electron microscopy and histological evaluations were performed to observe the biological responses of human bone tissue to porous Bonelike. The penetration depth was determined for all implantation periods, and after 6 months it was already possible to see new bone in the centre of the implanted cylinders, which gives 100% of penetration depth for all implantations periods except for 3 months when bone could only be seen in the peripherical region.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA), the only effective surgical treatment once the head has mechanically and clinically failed, had a poor track record for young active patients. Recently, THA using highly cross-linked polyethylene, metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, or ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces have given promising results, changing the \"save-at-all-costs\" paradigm. Operations that have a low success rate, high complication rate or morbidity, or compromise subsequent THA can no longer be justified.

Survival of PECAM-1(-/-) allografts in BALB/c recipients did not differ from that of wild-type-derived transplants (12.2+/-3.0 vs. 9.3+/-0.7; P>0.05). In all allografts, histology showed massive monomorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, indicating parenchymal rejection. Immunohistochemistry confirmed in all transplants a preserved donor endothelial phenotype. Our data indicate a subtle role of nonendothelial PECAM-1 in acute allograft rejection.

In this study, we explored the role of S1P 2 receptor (S1P2R) in normal vascularization and hypoxia-triggered pathological angiogenesis of the mouse retina. S1P2R is strongly induced in ECs during hypoxic stress. When neonatal mice were subjected to ischemia-driven retinopathy, pathologic neovascularization in the vitreous chamber was suppressed in S1p2-/- mice concomitant with reduction in endothelial gaps and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, EC patterning and normal revascularization into the avascular zones of the retina were augmented. Reduced expression of the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and increased expression of eNOS were observed in the S1p2-/- mouse retina. S1P2R activation in ECs induced COX-2 expression and suppressed the expression of eNOS.

Therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis is an appealing strategy for treatment of cancer. Since angiogenesis is the result of several mechanistic processes, controlled by numerable pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and their receptors, multiple possibilities to prevent or reverse tumor-induced neo-vascularization have been proposed. Of these, currently, the most promising approach has been the use of bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the most potent pro-angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab has been shown to be active in several malignancies, in particular colo-rectal cancer. Although early studies of bevacizumab in far-advanced metastatic breast cancer were disappointing, the results of a recently reported clinical trial by the Eastern Oncology Group comparing first line paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in response rates and time progression. Ongoing studies are now investigating the benefits of bevacizumab with other chemotherapeutic and biologic agents in early metastatic disease as well as in the adjuvant setting. Other anti-angiogenic agents remain in early clinical trials. Small molecular inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, such as sunitinib, appear promising.

We have further investigated the role of Stat3 in epithelial carcinogenesis using mice in which the expression of a constitutively active/dimerized form of Stat3 (Stat3C) is targeted to the proliferative compartment of epidermis (referred to as K5.Stat3C transgenic mice). Keratinocytes from K5.Stat3C mice showed increased survival following exposure to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and enhanced proliferation following exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In two-stage chemical carcinogenesis experiments using DMBA as the tumor initiator and TPA as the promoter, K5.Stat3C mice developed skin tumors with a shorter latency and in much greater number compared to non-transgenic littermates. Remarkably, 100% of the skin tumors that developed in K5.Stat3C transgenic mice bypassed the premalignant stage and were initially diagnosed as carcinoma in situ which rapidly progressed to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These tumors were highly vascularized, poorly differentiated and invasive and loss of expression of K10, filaggrin and E-cadherin was observed by 20 weeks. Finally, overexpression of Stat3C in a papilloma cell line led to enhanced cell migration and enhanced invasion through Matrigel in both the absence and presence of growth factors.

AZD2171 is an oral, highly potent small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR tyrosine kinase activity that inhibits angiogenesis and the growth of human tumor xenografts in vivo. Here, we show pharmacodynamic changes in VEGFR-2 phosphorylation induced by AZD2171. In mouse lung tissue, a single dose of AZD2171 at 6 mg/kg inhibited VEGF-A-stimulated VEGFR-2 phosphorylation by 87% at 2 h with significant inhibition (>or=60%) maintained to 24 h. To examine inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in tumor vasculature by immunohistochemistry, a comprehensive assessment of antibodies to various phosphorylation sites on the receptor was undertaken. Antibodies to the phosphotyrosine epitopes pY1175/1173 and pY1214/1212 were found suitable for this application. Calu-6 human lung tumor xenografts, from mice receiving AZD2171 or vehicle treatment (p.o., once daily), were examined by immunohistochemistry. A significant reduction in tumor vessel staining of phosphorylated VEGFR-2 (pVEGFR-2) was evident within 28 h of AZD2171 treatment (6 mg/kg). This effect preceded a significant reduction in tumor microvessel density, which was detectable following 52 h of AZD2171 treatment. These data show that AZD2171 is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2 activation in vivo and suggest that AZD2171 delivers therapeutic benefit in Calu-6 tumors by targeting vessels dependent on VEGFR-2 signaling for survival.

Manufacturer Web sites were used to obtain information about IO insertion devices.\nAll available English-language clinical trials, retrospective studies, and review articles describing IO drug administration were reviewed. Studies conducted in animal models to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IO drug administration were also included.\nIO access uses the highly vascularized bone marrow to deliver fluids and medications during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This route, developed in the 1940s, has been revived in the past decade as a means of achieving rapid vascular access when intravenous access cannot be obtained. The primary advantage of IO access is the high success rate (approximately 80%). Most trained providers can place an IO line within 1-2 minutes. A number of small-scale studies and retrospective reviews have established the usefulness of this route for the delivery of many commonly used resuscitation drugs. In addition, animal models have demonstrated rapid drug delivery to the systemic circulation. While all resuscitation drugs can be given by the IO route, administration of ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, phenytoin, tobramycin, and vancomycin may result in lower peak serum concentrations. The most common adverse effect seen with IO use, extravasation, has been reported in 12% of patients. Compartment syndrome, osteomyelitis, and tibial fracture are rare, but have also been reported.\nIO administration is a safe and effective method for delivering drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Our purpose was to analyze various MR imaging features of a spinal epidural hemangioma with histopathologic correlation.\nAfter searching through the pathology data bases in 3 hospitals, we included 14 patients (9 male and 5 female; mean age, 38 years; age range, 2-62 years) with spinal epidural hemangiomas confirmed by surgical resection after MR imaging. Three radiologists reviewed the MR imaging in consensus and categorized the features into subtypes on the basis of histopathologic findings.\nWe categorized the MR imaging features as follows: type A for a cystlike mass with T1 hyperintensity (2 cases, arteriovenous type with an organized hematoma), type B for a cystlike mass with T1 isointensity (3 cases, venous type), type C for a solid hypervascular mass (7 cases, cavernous type), and type D for an epidural hematoma (2 cases, cavernous type with hematoma). Types A and B had frequent single segmental involvement (4/5), whereas types C and D had multisegmental involvement in all. Regardless of MR types, lobular contour (8/14) and a rim of low T2 signal intensity (8/14) of the mass were common. T1 hyperintensity of the mass was occasionally seen (5/14).\nSpinal epidural hemangiomas can have various MR imaging features according to their different histopathologic backgrounds. In addition to common features such as solid hypervascularity, lobular contour, and a rim of low T2 signal intensity, T1 hyperintensity or multisegmental involvement may also be a clue in the differential diagnosis of a spinal epidural hemangioma.", "journal": "AJNR.

Studies have shown that if blood supply is compromised, application of osteogenic factors alone could not induce successful healing. This study was to evaluate the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor, which combined with a coralline scaffold, on vascularization, scaffold resorption and osteogenesis in a rabbit radius critical size defect model. The scaffold was either coated with a control-plasmid DNA (group 1), coated with VEGF-plasmid DNA (group 2), loaded with mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) transfected with control plasmid (group 3) or with both stem cells and the VEGF plasmid (group 4). X-rays were taken every 4 weeks up to week 16, when animals were euthanized. The volume of new bone was measured by mu-CT scans and blood vessels were counted after anti-CD31 staining of endothelial cells. The results from the solitary VEGF- and VEGF-transfected cells (groups 2 and 4) demonstrated significantly enhanced vascularization, osteogenesis and resorption of the carrier when compared to the control group. The highest degree of osteogenesis was found when the carrier was loaded with BMSC (group 3), whereas VEGF-transfected cells led to the highest vascularization and fastest resorption of the bone substitute. Additionally, VEGF-transfected BMSC led to a more homogenous vascularization of the defect.

By imaging an object from different viewing angles in one 2D image plane and summing the images obtained (spatial compounding), image quality can be increased and artifacts can be suppressed. In the present study, we combined both techniques to overcome the limitations of contrast-agent imaging.

Cartilage-on-bone samples were statically compressed (7 MPa) to near-equilibrium using an 8-mm diameter cylindrical indenter, and then formalin-fixed in this deformed state. Following mild decalcification full-depth cartilage-bone sections, incorporating the indentation profile and beyond, were studied in their fully hydrated state using differential interference contrast optical microscopy (DIC).\nDifferences in matrix texture, degree of disruption of the articular surface layer (or its complete absence), number of tidemarks and absence or presence of vascularization of the calcified cartilage zone were all observable features that provided clear differentiation between the normal and degenerate tissues. Under load a chevron-type shear discontinuity characterized those samples in which the strain-limiting surface layer was still largely intact. The extent to which this shear discontinuity advanced into the adjacent non-directly loaded cartilage continuum was influenced by the integrity of the cartilage general matrix. For those tissues deficient in a strain-limiting articular surface there was no shear discontinuity, the cartilage deformation field was instead shaped primarily by its osteochondral attachment and a laterally-directed compressive collapse of a much weakened matrix. In the degenerate samples the altered matrix textures associated with different regions of the deformation field are interpreted in terms of an intrinsic fibrillar architecture that is weakened by two fundamental processes: (1) a de-structuring resulting from a reduction in connectivity between fibrils and (2) subsequent aggregation of these now disconnected fibrils.\nDIC microscopy provides a high-resolution description of the integrated osteochondral tissue system across the full continuum of matrices, from normal to severely degenerate. Our study demonstrates the important functional role played by the strain-limiting articular surface, the consequences associated with its disruption, as well as the loss of effective stress transmission associated with a 'de-structured' general matrix.

A large extent of osteonecrosis greater than 300 degrees was significantly associated with poor scores, radiographic progression and poor survival rate (67%). There was no relationship between the distance from the tip of the grafted fibula to the subchondral bone of the femoral head and postoperative radiographic progression.\nIn conclusion, small osteonecrosis (less than 300 degrees of the femoral head) without preoperative collapse (Steinberg's stages I and II) is the major indication for free vascularized fibular grafting. Steroid-induced osteonecrosis is a relative contraindication. Large osteonecrosis (greater than 300 degrees) with severe preoperative collapse (greater than 3 mm) is a major contraindication. Hips with 2 negative factors such as severe preoperative collapse and a large extent of osteonecrosis, require hip replacements.", "journal": "BMC musculoskeletal disorders", "date": "2007-08-10", "authors": ["KenjiKawate", "HiroshiYajima", "KazuyaSugimoto", "HiroshiOno", "TetsujiOhmura", "YasunoriKobata", "KeiichiMurata", "KojiShigematsu", "KenjiKawamura", "IkuoKawahara", "NaokiMaegawa", "KatsuyaTamai", "YoshinoriTakakura", "SusumuTamai"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2474-8-78\n10.1016/S0883-5403(99)90221-8\n10.1016/0883-5403(94)90091-4\n10.1097/00003086-199704000-00016\n10.1007/s00776-004-0841-0\n10.1097/00003086-200105000-00016\n10.2106/JBJS.D.02004\n10.1007/s007760200108\n10.1210/jc.85.8.2907\n10.1210/en.142.3.1333\n10.2106/JBJS.D.01936\n10.1055/s-2005-864842\n10.1007/s00402-004-0777-z"}

Specimens were stained with NADH (beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) histochemical technique and examined with light microscope. Microscopically little modifications in mesh-like structure of intestinal Auerbach's plexus from eSS were detected in comparison with Wistar rats samples. Intestinal plexus of eSMT and beta rats showed disruption of mesh-like structures, modifications in the slightly colored background (smooth muscle) and augmented vascularization.

{"title": "Modern reconstruction techniques for oral and pharyngeal defects after tumor resection.", "abstract": "Several techniques have been developed to reconstruct oral and pharyngeal defects following surgery, in order to restore function and cosmesis. These are primary closure, skin grafts, local transposition of skin, mucosa and/or muscle, regional flaps and free vascularized flaps. Because of the 'bulky', pedicled nature and problems with the donor area of locoregional flaps, and consequently frequently unsatisfactory functional results, free vascularized flaps have gained popularity during the last decade. The authors review the current options available to give physicians, who are not experienced in the field of reconstruction in the head and neck, an impression of the range of techniques available for reconstruction of oral and pharyngeal defects following tumor resection. For reconstruction of oral cavity and pharyngeal defects, fasciocutaneous (e.g. radial forearm and anterolateral thigh flaps) and myocutaneous free flaps (e.g. rectus abdominis and latissimus dorsi) have proven to be very reliable. Free vascularized osteocutaneous flaps (e.g. fibula and iliac crest) permit reconstructive options for bony defects of the mandible or maxilla that can be adapted to a variety of defects. Depending on the site, size and involved tissues of the surgical defect and patient factors, a variety of reconstructive options are available. For both soft tissue and bony defects of the upper aerodigestive tract, microvascular free flaps provide good functional outcomes.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2007-08-09", "authors": ["Remcode Bree", "AlessandraRinaldo", "Eric MGenden", "CarlosSu\u00e1rez", "Juan PabloRodrigo", "Johannes JFagan", "Luiz PKowalski", "AlfioFerlito", "C Ren\u00e9Leemans"], "doi": "10.1007/s00405-007-0413-y"}
{"title": "Zymosan-induced inflammation stimulates neo-adipogenesis.", "abstract": "To investigate the potential of inflammation to induce new adipose tissue formation in the in vivo environment.\nUsing an established model of in vivo adipogenesis, a silicone chamber containing a Matrigel and fibroblast growth factor 2 (1 microg/ml) matrix was implanted into each groin of an adult male C57Bl6 mouse and vascularized with the inferior epigastric vessels. Sterile inflammation was induced in one of the two chambers by suspending Zymosan-A (ZA) (200-0.02 microg/ml) in the matrix at implantation. Adipose tissue formation was assessed at 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. ZA induced significant adipogenesis in an inverse dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). At 6 weeks adipose tissue formation was greatest with the lowest concentrations of ZA and least with the highest. Adipogenesis occurred both locally in the chamber containing ZA and in the ZA-free chamber in the contralateral groin of the same animal. ZA induced a systemic inflammatory response characterized by elevated serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels at early time points. Aminoguanidine (40 microg/ml) inhibited the adipogenic response to ZA-induced inflammation. Adipose tissue formed in response to ZA remained stable for 24 weeks, even when exposed to the normal tissue environment.\nThese results demonstrate that inflammation can drive neo-adipogenesis in vivo. This suggests the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in obesity, whereby the state of chronic, low-grade inflammation, characteristic of the condition, may promote further adipogenesis. The mobilization and recruitment of a circulating population of adipose precursor cells is likely to be implicated in this mechanism.", "journal": "International journal of obesity (2005)", "date": "2007-08-09", "authors": ["G P LThomas", "KHemmrich", "K MAbberton", "DMcCombe", "A JPenington", "E WThompson", "W AMorrison"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.ijo.0803702"}

We hypothesized that adult human EPDCs might partly reactivate their embryonic program when transplanted into ischemic myocardium and improve cardiac performance after myocardial infarction.\nEPDCs were isolated from human adult atrial tissue. Myocardial infarction was created in immunodeficient mice, followed by intramyocardial injection of 4x10(5) enhanced green fluorescent protein-labeled EPDCs (2-week survival, n=22; 6-week survival, n=15) or culture medium (n=24 and n=18, respectively). Left ventricular function was assessed with a 9.4T animal MRI unit. Ejection fraction was similar between groups on day 2 but was significantly higher in the EPDC-injected group at 2 weeks (short term), as well as after long-term survival at 6 weeks. End-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were significantly smaller in the EPDC-injected group than in the medium-injected group at all ages evaluated. At 2 weeks, vascularization was significantly increased in the EPDC-treated group, as was wall thickness, a development that might be explained by augmented DNA-damage repair activity in the infarcted area. Immunohistochemical analysis showed massive engraftment of injected EPDCs at 2 weeks, with expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, and voltage-gated sodium channel (alpha-subunit; SCN5a). EPDCs were negative for cardiomyocyte markers. At 6-weeks survival, wall thickness was still increased, but only a few EPDCs could be detected.\nAfter transplantation into ischemic myocardium, adult human EPDCs preserve cardiac function and attenuate ventricular remodeling.

Here we demonstrate that Notch1 signaling is essential for cell fate maintenance of corneal epithelium during repair. Inducible ablation of Notch1 in the cornea combined with mechanical wounding show that Notch1-deficient corneal progenitor cells differentiate into a hyperplastic, keratinized, skin-like epithelium. This cell fate switch leads to corneal blindness and involves cell nonautonomous processes, characterized by secretion of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) through Notch1(-/-) epithelium followed by vascularization and remodeling of the underlying stroma.

Cells with activated Notch2 or Notch4 were injected into nu/nu mice for analysis of in vivo tumor xenograft phenotype. Tumor growth was significantly altered depending on the receptor activated. Notch2ICD potently suppressed tumor take and growth, leading to a 60% decrease in tumors and significantly smaller, necrotic tumors. Despite this, Notch2ICD tumors were highly vascularized, although the vessels were smaller and comprised a more immature network compared with Notch4ICD tumors. Notch4ICD tumors were highly aggressive and well vascularized, indicating a role for Notch4 signaling in the promotion of the malignant phenotype in addition to its transforming ability. Although both NotchICD groups expressed angiogenic factors, Notch4ICD had selective vascular endothelial growth factor-D in both tumor and host stroma, suggesting a differential regulation of cytokines that may impact vascular recruitment and autocrine tumor signaling.

Since short-term intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) enhances rat fracture healing, we investigated the effects of 4-week intermittent low-dose (10 microg/kg/day) or high-dose (100 microg/kg/day) PTH followed by 4-week vehicle, low-dose or high-dose intermittent PTH, or zoledronic acid (ZOL, 2 micro/kg/week), a potent bisphosphonate, on large skeletal reconstruction by vascularized tibial grafting in rats. Compared to 8-week vehicle, 8-week low-dose PTH did not significantly increase the serum osteocalcin level as well as the urinary deoxypyridinoline level, while 4-week low-dose or high-dose PTH followed by 4-week ZOL decreased both of these levels. Eight-week PTH increased the bone mass of the graft and strength of the reconstructed skeleton in a dose-dependent manner; notably, the reconstructed skeleton showed an obviously higher response to PTH compared to the contralateral nonoperated femur. In contrast, 4-week PTH followed by 4-week vehicle reduced these effects and caused local bone loss at the host-graft junctions. Four-week PTH followed by 4-week ZOL did not induce such bone loss; however, 4-week high-dose PTH followed by 4-week ZOL caused a large callus in the distal cortical junction. Four-week PTH followed by 4-week ZOL increased the bone mass and strength similarly to 8-week PTH.

{"title": "Transcriptional control in embryonic Drosophila midline guidance assessed through a whole genome approach.", "abstract": "During the development of the Drosophila central nervous system the process of midline crossing is orchestrated by a number of guidance receptors and ligands. Many key axon guidance molecules have been identified in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but the transcriptional regulation of growth cone guidance remains largely unknown. It is established that translational regulation plays a role in midline crossing, and there are indications that transcriptional regulation is also involved. To investigate this issue, we conducted a genome-wide study of transcription in Drosophila embryos using wild type and a number of well-characterized Drosophila guidance mutants and transgenics. We also analyzed a previously published microarray time course of Drosophila embryonic development with an axon guidance focus.\nUsing hopach, a novel clustering method which is well suited to microarray data analysis, we identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns across guidance mutants and transgenics. We then systematically characterized the resulting clusters with respect to their relevance to axon guidance using two complementary controlled vocabularies: the Gene Ontology (GO) and anatomical annotations of the Atlas of Pattern of Gene Expression (APoGE) in situ hybridization database. The analysis indicates that regulation of gene expression does play a role in the process of axon guidance in Drosophila. We also find a strong link between axon guidance and hemocyte migration, a result that agrees with mounting evidence that axon guidance molecules are co-opted in vertebrate vascularization. Cell cyclin activity in the context of axon guidance is also suggested from our array data.

The present study was designed to determine whether this cathepsin inhibitor, when used in combination with chemotherapy, would increase antitumor efficacy. RT2 mice were treated in a late-stage regression trial with three different chemotherapy regimens, alone or in combination with the cathepsin inhibitor, JPM-OEt. Cyclophosphamide was administered in either a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen, a \"metronomic\" continuous low-dose regimen, or a \"chemo-switch\" regimen consisting of MTD followed by metronomic dosing. Mice were sacrificed at a defined end point and tumor burden was assessed followed by a detailed analysis of cell proliferation, apoptosis, vascularization, and invasiveness in the treated and control lesions. An additional cohort of mice was followed for survival analysis. The cathepsin inhibitor plus the chemo-switch regimen of cyclophosphamide led to the most pronounced reduction in tumor burden and greatest increase in overall survival. Cysteine cathepsin inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in tumor invasiveness, which was further augmented in combination with each of the chemotherapy dosing regimens.

The aim of the present experimental pilot study was to produce three-dimensional (3D) autologous tissue-engineered constructs that combine autogenous cultivated bone marrow stromal cells with beta-tricalcium phosphate to reconstruct segmental mandible defects without donor site morbidity. Bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from a dog's caput femoris. After differentiation and proliferation in vitro, the cells were seeded into a 3D beta-tricalcium phosphate scaffold. The constructs were incubated under osteogenic culture conditions for 5 days. Segmental defects of 30 mm length were created unilaterally in the mandibles of the animals. Reconstruction was performed using the construct in three dogs and the scaffold only in three dogs as a control group. The specimens were retrieved 3 months later, and the reconstructed areas were processed for gross observation, radiographic examination, 3D computed tomographic (CT) imaging, biomechanical evaluations, and histologic observation.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated as an attractive cell source for tissue-engineering applications because of their ability to be easily isolated and expanded from adult bone marrow and their versatility for pluripotent differentiation into mesenchymal tissues.\nThe purpose of our work was to evaluate in vitro the osteogenic potential (proliferation and differentiation) of rat MSC cultured in monolayer conditions and encapsulated in alginate beads and in vivo the osteogenic potential of encapsulated MSC implanted at an extraosseous site associated with a periosteal flap to obtain the equivalent of a vascularized bone autograft.\nIn vitro, the encapsulation of MSC in alginate beads maintains their degree of differentiation towards the osteoblastic lineage. In vivo, standard radiographs revealed \"calcifications\" adjacent to the area where alginate beads had been implanted in both groups (in the presence or the absence of MSC). In the group \"beads alone,\" histologic analysis showed that calcifications reflected only a peripheral calcification with no bone formation.

{"title": "Why don't all whales have cancer? A novel hypothesis resolving Peto's paradox.", "abstract": "Larger organisms have more potentially carcinogenic cells, tend to live longer and require more ontogenic cell divisions. Therefore, intuitively one might expect cancer incidence to scale with body size. Evidence from mammals, however, suggests that the cancer risk does not correlate with body size. This observation defines \"Peto's paradox.\" Here, we propose a novel hypothesis to resolve Peto's paradox. We suggest that malignant tumors are disadvantaged in larger hosts. In particular, we hypothesize that natural selection acting on competing phenotypes among the cancer cell population will tend to favor aggressive \"cheaters\" that then grow as a tumor on their parent tumor, creating a hypertumor that damages or destroys the original neoplasm. In larger organisms, tumors need more time to reach lethal size, so hypertumors have more time to evolve. So, in large organisms, cancer may be more common and less lethal. We illustrate this hypothesis in silico using a previously published hypertumor model. Results from the model predict that malignant neoplasms in larger organisms should be disproportionately necrotic, aggressive, and vascularized than deadly tumors in small mammals. These predictions may serve as the basis on which to test the hypothesis, but to our knowledge, no one has yet performed a systematic investigation of comparative necrosis, histopathology, or vascularization among mammalian cancers.", "journal": "Integrative and comparative biology", "date": "2007-08-01", "authors": ["John DNagy", "Erin MVictor", "Jenese HCropper"], "doi": "10.1093/icb/icm062"}
{"title": "Dynamics of tumor growth and combination of anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic therapies.", "abstract": "Tumors cannot grow beyond a certain size (about 1-2 mm in diameter) through simple diffusion of oxygen and other essential nutrients into the tumor. Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a crucial and observed step, through which a tumor obtains its own blood supply. Thus, strategies that interfere with the development of this tumor vasculature, known as anti-angiogenic therapy, represent a novel approach to controlling tumor growth. Several pre-clinical studies have suggested that currently available angiogenesis inhibitors are unlikely to yield significant sustained improvements in tumor control on their own, but rather will need to be used in combination with conventional treatments to achieve maximal benefit. Optimal sequencing of anti-angiogenic treatment and radiotherapy or chemotherapy is essential to the success of these combined treatment strategies. Hence, a major challenge to mathematical modeling and computer simulations is to find appropriate dosages, schedules and sequencing of combination therapies to control or eliminate tumor growth. Here, we present a mathematical model that incorporates tumor cells and the vascular network, as well as their interplay. We can then include the effects of two different treatments, conventional cytotoxic therapy and anti-angiogenic therapy.

{"title": "A general model for allometric covariation in botanical form and function.", "abstract": "The West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) theory for the origin of allometric scaling laws is centered on the idea that the geometry of the vascular network governs how a suite of organismal traits covary with each other and, ultimately, how they scale with organism size. This core assumption has been combined with other secondary assumptions based on physiological constraints, such as minimizing the scaling of transport and biomechanical costs while maximally filling a volume. Together, these assumptions give predictions for specific \"quarter-power\" scaling exponents in biology. Here we provide a strong test of the core assumption of WBE by examining how well it holds when the secondary assumptions have been relaxed. Our relaxed version of WBE predicts that allometric exponents are highly constrained and covary according to specific quantitative functions. To test this core prediction, we assembled several botanical data sets with measures of the allometry of morphological traits. A wide variety of plant taxa appear to obey the predictions of the model. Our results (i) underscore the importance of network geometry in governing the variability and central tendency of biological exponents, (ii) support the hypothesis that selection has primarily acted to minimize the scaling of hydrodynamic resistance, and (iii) suggest that additional selection pressures for alternative branching geometries govern much of the observed covariation in biological scaling exponents.

M\u00fcller cells were evaluated immunocytochemically with glial fibrillary acidic protein. The extent of vascularization was established histologically. ROP caused significant thinning of the inner cellular and plexiform layers, which became more pronounced in the peripheral inner nuclear layer of ROP animals (11.3% loss vs. 25.4% loss). Amacrine cell amino acid levels were particularly vulnerable in the peripheral retina; bipolar cells showed similar but less prominent changes. M\u00fcller cells had elevated glutamine levels and were most gliotic in the periphery. The vasculature extended to peripheral retinal regions at P18 in controls but not in ROP rats. The most striking pattern of change was evident in the midperipheral \"transition zone\" of ROP animals.

Abnormal structure and dysfunction of tumor blood vessels are responsible for these conditions. These repeated short periods of hypoxia concern tumor cells as well as endothelial cells. However, the effects of intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intermittent hypoxia on endothelial cells and particularly on HIF-1alpha, a central actor in adaptive response to hypoxia. For that, endothelial cells were exposed to four repeated cycles of 1-h hypoxia followed by 30 min of reoxygenation. We showed that repeated cycles of hypoxia/reoxygenation induced a modification in HIF-l alpha phosphorylation pattern: a progressive increase in HIF-1alpha phosphorylated form was observed during the hypoxic periods. Activation of p42/p44, Akt and PKA was observed in parallel. PKA was shown to be involved in the phosphorylation of HIF-lalpha under intermittent hypoxia, while p42/p44 and Akt were not.

The construct was stably transfected into human breast carcinoma MT-1 cells. Cell viability in vitro was evaluated in low serum and serum starvation conditions. In vivo study of tumor growth was evaluated in a nude mouse model. G3 effects on rodent vascular endothelial cells were evaluated in vitro on cell survival, apoptosis, migration, and vascular formation. The effects of VEGF, fibronectin, and G3 on vascular formation were examined. An intracardiac injection model of metastatic human breast carcinoma tested the effect of G3 on distant bony and soft tissue metastasis. Analysis of metastatic burden included histology, radiographs, and micro-CT quantification of osteolysis.\nA greater viability of cancer cells was observed in low serum and serum-free conditions in the presence of versican G3. Larger subcutaneous tumors were obtained in the G3 group following tumor cell injection into CD1 mice. G3 induced a greater degree of rodent vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Simultaneous presence of fibronectin, VEGF, and G3 promoted endothelial cell migration in wound-healing assays as compared to the treatments containing none, one or two of these molecules. Systemic tumor burden to distant bony and soft tissue metastatic sites was greater in the G3 group using the intracardiac injection metastatic model.\nVersican G3 domain appears to be important in local and systemic tumor invasiveness of human breast cancer.

Our objective was to determine whether alpha(5)beta(1) plays a role in ocular angiogenesis, and whether a novel alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule is able to reduce angiogenesis in a model of inflammatory corneal neovascularization. Corneal neovascularization was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by NaOH-application and debridement of the limbal epithelium. Mice were randomized into six groups receiving either no treatment, or intraperitoneal osmotic pumps delivering three different doses of integrin antagonist or control substance on day 10 after scraping. In order to quantify the neovascular response, flatmounts were stained with FITC-CD31. Integrin alpha(5) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified by semiquantitative western blot analysis. Influence of integrin antagonist treatment on the mRNA expression of VEGF, bFGF and integrin alpha(5) was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Vascularized corneas demonstrated a strong up-regulation of integrin alpha(5) within affected areas. Animals treated systemically with alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule showed a significant inhibition and regression of corneal neovascularization. PCR analysis evinced a significant up-regulation of VEGF and integrin alpha(5) mRNA levels in injured animals compared to controls, and a significant reduction of integrin alpha(5) mRNA in substance-treated animals compared to control substance, but no significant differences of bFGF levels in all groups.

However, our in vivo experiments show that subcutaneous injection of cells overexpressing HIF2alpha into syngenic mice, leads to the formation of tumour nodules that grow slower than controls, but that are well structured and highly vascularized. In contrast, HIF2alpha (1-485)-expressing neuroblastomas grow fast, but are poorly vascularized and quickly tend to extended necrosis.\nTogether, our data reveal an unexpected combination between an antiproliferative and a pro-angiogenic function of HIF2alpha that actually seems to be favourable to the establishment of neuroblastomas in vivo.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2007-07-28", "authors": ["JudithFavier", "St\u00e9phanieLapointe", "RicardoMaliba", "Martin GSirois"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-7-139\n10.1038/nrm1366\n10.1093/emboj/17.11.3005\n10.1038/28867\n10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00043-0\n10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00044-2\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3246\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.07.003\n10.1073/pnas.102660199\n10.1074/jbc.M402904200\n10.1002/bies.10031\n10.1074/jbc.274.44.31565\n10.1074/jbc.M400840200\n10.1083/jcb.107.2.771\n10.1128/MCB.23.1.359-369.2003\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600196\n10.1073/pnas.140087397\n10.1161/01.RES.0000134920.10128.b4\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.08.026"}

In bone, osteoblasts and bone marrow stem cells provide cue elements for the proliferation of endothelial cells, differentiation of endothelial precursors, and the maturation of a vascular network. In this study, we investigated outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs), a potential source of autologous endothelial cells derived from human peripheral blood, in direct 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D co-culture systems with cells relevant for the regeneration of bone tissue, such as osteoblasts. In the co-cultures, OECs were evaluated in terms of their stability as an endothelial population at the single cell level using flow cytometry and their ability to establish a pre-vascular network at the light-microscopical and ultra-structural level. In co-cultures with the osteoblast cell line MG63 and with human primary osteoblasts (pOBs), OECs, in contrast to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, formed highly organized microvessel-like structures. These microvessel-like structures included the formation of a vascular lumen with tight junctional complexes at intercellular contacts of endothelial cells. In the co-culture, the formation of this vascular network was achieved in the standard growth medium for OECs. Furthermore, using a rotating culture vessel system, 3-D co-cultures consisting of OECs and pOBs were generated. Based on these observations, we conclude that OECs could provide a valuable source of autologous endothelial cells for the generation of complex tissue-engineered tissues.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-07-28", "authors": ["SabineFuchs", "AlexanderHofmann", "C JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2007.0022"}

The phase images were high-pass-filtered and processed region by region with hand-drawn areas. The regions evaluated included the motor cortex (MC), putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), caudate nucleus (CN), substantia nigra (SN), and red nucleus (RN). A total of 75 subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 89 years, were analyzed.\nThe phase was found to have a Gaussian-like distribution with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.046 radians on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Most regions of interest (ROIs) contained at least 100 pixels, giving a standard error of the mean (SEM) of 0.0046 radians or less. In the MC, phase differences were found to be roughly 0.273 radians between CSF and gray matter (GM), and 0.083 radians between CSF and white matter (WM). The difference between CSF and the GP was 0.201 radians, and between CSF and the CN (head) it was 0.213 radians. For CSF and the PUT (the lower outer part) the difference was 0.449 radians, and between CSF and the RN (third slice vascularized region) it was 0.353 radians. Finally, the phase difference between CSF and SN was 0.345 radians.\nThe Gaussian-like distributions in phase make it possible to predict deviations from normal phase behavior for tissues in the brain. Using phase as an iron marker may be useful for studying absorption of iron in diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), Alzheimer's, and multiple sclerosis (MS), and other iron-related diseases.

Patients with uveal melanoma also have low 5-year survival rates, thus new therapeutic modalities are necessary. As both retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma are highly vascular, we tested application of a gene transduction approach with a potent TH1 cytokine also endowed with strong anti-angiogenic activity, Interleukin-12 (IL-12). Gene transfer into murine 99E1 uveal melanoma-like cells, while having no effects on growth in vitro, essentially blocked subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo without evident signs of toxicity. Orthotopic intraocular injection resulted in invasive tumors that destroyed ocular architecture by the control cells while the IL-12 transduced cells rarely formed tumors. Histological analysis revealed highly invasive and angiogenic tumor growth in the controls and poorly vascularized tumors in the presence of IL-12. The tumor repression effect could be reproduced by a systemic anti-angiogenic effect, where controlateral injection of IL-12 expressing cells strongly repressed growth in tumors formed by parental 99E1 cells. This was associated with significantly lowered tumor vessel densities, a trend toward lower VEGF levels in the lesion, and significantly decreased NK cells in the parental tumors exposed to systemic IL-12.

Of the EDG family S1P receptors, EDG-5 (S1P2) is inhibited in migration induced by S1P. Diabetes impairs numerous aspects of tissue repair. Failure of wound angiogenesis is known to delay diabetic wound healing.\nWe examined whether S1P subcutaneous injection could improve the healing of full-thickness skin wounds in healthy and diabetic mice. We further determine if the combined S1P and EDG-5 (S1P2) antagonist injection in diabetic mice could affect wound healing. Finally, we examined the histopathological findings of the wound following S1P injection in diabetic mice.\nEight- to 10-week-old BALA/c mice, diabetic db/db mice and Wister rats were used for the studies. A full-thickness wound was made on the dorsal skin of the healthy and diabetic mice. Either 10 microM or 100 microM of S1P or vehicle control (BSA/PBS) was injected into the wound bed every day. We calculated the wound area after each injection. EDG-5 (S1P2) antagonist (JTE-013) or vehicle (DMSO) was then injected in addition to the S1P around the dorsal wound of diabetic mice and the wound diameter was measured. Wound tissue samples were excised following injection for histopathological examination.\nWound area in normal BALA/c mice did not significantly decrease upon S1P injection compared to S1P-untreated controls. S1P injection alone showed significant promotion of wound healing in diabetic mice compared to no S1P treatment. The combination of S1P and EDG-5 (S1P2) receptor antagonist administration induced maximal wound healing in diabetic mice. Histopathological examination revealed that S1P induces neo-vascularization potential in rats and diabetic mice wound.\nS1P injection in diabetic mice significantly accelerated cutaneous wound healing in the neo-vascularization process.

We show that the EWS/FLI1 fusion suppresses the expression of thrombospondins in both NIH3T3 fibroblasts and Ewing's sarcoma tumor-derived cell lines. This regulation depends on an intact EWS/FLI1 DNA-binding domain and may involve direct interactions between EWS/FLI1 and thrombospondin promoter regions. Forced expression of thrombospondins in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines inhibited the rate of tumor formation in vivo and markedly decreased the number of microvessels present in the tumors.

{"title": "ASB4 is a hydroxylation substrate of FIH and promotes vascular differentiation via an oxygen-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of endothelial differentiation into a functional vascular network are incompletely understood. To identify novel factors in endothelial development, we used a microarray screen with differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells that identified the gene for ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 4 (ASB4) as the most highly differentially expressed gene in the vascular lineage during early differentiation. Like other SOCS box-containing proteins, ASB4 is the substrate recognition molecule of an elongin B/elongin C/cullin/Roc ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of substrate protein(s). High levels of ASB4 expression in the embryonic vasculature coincide with drastic increases in oxygen tension as placental blood flow is initiated. However, as vessels mature and oxygen levels stabilize, ASB4 expression is quickly downregulated, suggesting that ASB4 may function to modulate an endothelium-specific response to increasing oxygen tension. Consistent with the hypothesis that ASB4 function is regulated by oxygen concentration, ASB4 interacts with the factor inhibiting HIF1alpha (FIH) and is a substrate for FIH-mediated hydroxylation via an oxygen-dependent mechanism. Additionally, overexpression of ASB4 in ES cells promotes differentiation into the vascular lineage in an oxygen-dependent manner. We postulate that hydroxylation of ASB4 in normoxia promotes binding to and degradation of substrate protein(s) to modulate vascular differentiation.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2007-07-20", "authors": ["James EFerguson", "YaxuWu", "KevinSmith", "PeterCharles", "KylePowers", "HongWang", "CamPatterson"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.00511-07"}

This modification is typically achieved through the long-term administration of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients thus trade their end-stage organ failure for dependence on daily drug therapy and the accompanying chronic condition of immunodeficiency. However, it is clear from studies in experimental animals that rejection can be prevented through the use of several therapeutic approaches, including donor hematopoietic cell infusion, chimerism, T cell depletion, and/or co-stimulation blockade. Successfully treated animals avoid rejection beyond the period of therapy without a phenotype of chronic immunosuppression and are thus considered to be tolerant of their grafts. Although intriguing, this success in animals has yet to be reproducibly translated to the clinic, and human transplant recipients remain tethered to immunosuppressive drugs with rare exceptions.

Kaposi's sarcoma, associated with increased angiogenesis, is a highly vascularized, endothelial cell-derived tumor. Previously, we have shown that the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) targets the HIF-1alpha suppressors von Hippel-Lindau protein and p53 for degradation via its suppressor of cytokine signaling-box motif, which recruits the EC5S ubiquitin complex. Here we further show that HIF-1alpha was aberrantly accumulated in KSHV latently infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, as well as HEK293 cells infected with KSHV, and also show that a potential alpha-helical amino-terminal domain of LANA was important for HIF-1alpha nuclear accumulation in normoxic conditions. Moreover, we have now determined that this association was dependent on the residues 46 to 89 of LANA and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha. Introduction of specific small interfering RNA against LANA into PEL cells also resulted in a diminished nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Therefore, these data show that LANA can function not only as an inhibitor of HIF-1alpha suppressor proteins but can also induce nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha during KSHV latent infection.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2007-07-20", "authors": ["QiliangCai", "MasanaoMurakami", "HuaxinSi", "Erle SRobertson"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.00611-07"}

{"title": "Skeletal myoblasts as a therapeutic agent.", "abstract": "Cell transplantation is emerging as a new treatment designed to improve the poor outcome of patients with cardiac failure. Its rationale is that implantation of contractile cells into postinfarction scars could functionally rejuvenate these areas. Primarily for practical reasons, autologous skeletal myoblasts have been the first to be considered for a clinical use. A large number of experimental studies have consistently documented a robust engraftment of myoblasts, their in-scar differentiation into myotubes, and an associated improvement in left ventricular function. The early results of phase I clinical trials have then established both the feasibility and safety of this procedure with the caveat of arrhythmic events. Efficacy data are equally encouraging but definitely need to be validated by large prospective placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trials such as the Myoblast Autologous Grafting in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (MAGIC) study, the results of which are now pending. In addition to assessing the effect of myoblast transplantation on regional and global heart function, these results will also provide comprehensive safety data and thus allow a more objective assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. However, it is already apparent that the outcome of myoblast transfer could most likely be improved by optimizing the purity of the cell yield (by selecting muscle-derived progenitors less lineage-committed than the myoblasts), the mode of delivery (by increasing the accuracy of cell injections while decreasing their invasiveness), and the survival of the engrafted cells (by concomitant graft vascularization and incorporation of cells in three-dimensional matrices). Most, if not all, of these changes will have to be incorporated before skeletal myoblasts can acquire the status of therapeutic agents. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that myoblasts may act by attenuating left ventricular remodeling or paracrinally affecting the surrounding myocardium but not by generating new cardiomyocytes because of their strict commitment to a myogenic lineage. Thus, improvement of function is not tantamount of myocardial regeneration, and if such a regeneration remains the primary objective, it is worth considering alternate cell types able to generate new cardiac cells that will be electromechanically coupled with the host cardiomyocytes. In the setting of this second generation of cells, human cardiac-specified embryonic stem cells may hold the greatest promise.", "journal": "Progress in cardiovascular diseases", "date": "2007-07-17", "authors": ["PhilippeMenasch\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pcad.2007.02.002"}

A total of 151 patients were enrolled in the study. Before the radio-frequency (RF) or microwave ablation treatment, tumor vascularity was assessed in 139 patients with three imaging modalities i.e., US (139 exams), CEUS (139 exams) and CECT (103 exams)/CEMR (36 exams). CEUS examination was performed using a sulphur hexafluoride-filled microbubble contrast agent (SonoVue((R)), Bracco, Milan, Italy) and real-time contrast-specific imaging techniques. Within 30 +/- 7 d after the ablation procedure, 118/139 patients were monitored to assess the tumor response to treatment. Before ablation, contrast enhancement within tumor was observed in 129/139 (92.8%) patients with CEUS and 133/139 (95.7%) patients with CECT/CEMRI. Compared with CECT/CEMRI, CEUS sensitivity and accuracy in detecting tumor vascularity were 97.0% and 94.2%, respectively. One month after treatment, no enhancement was seen in 110/118 (93.2%) both on CEUS and CECT/CEMRI. Concordance between CEUS and CECT/CEMR on the presence of residual vascularization was obtained in four patients (true positive). The specificity and accuracy of CEUS in detecting tumor vascularity were 98.2% and 96.6%, respectively. The periprocedural impact of SonoVue administration on the assessment of treatment extent was also evaluated in a subgroup of patients and CEUS showed its superiority compared with baseline US in defining treatment outcome. In conclusion, in the detection of HCC tumor vascularity and assessment of response to thermal ablation after 1 month, real time CEUS provided results comparable to those obtained with CECT/CEMRI.

{"title": "Chondromodulin-I and tenomodulin: the negative control of angiogenesis in connective tissue.", "abstract": "The negative regulation of angiogenesis may provide a promising therapeutic target for a number of lifestyle-related diseases, as the switch to an angiogenic phenotype in many tissues represents a critical step during the progression of such disorders. Cartilage is avascular and shows resistance to vascular invasion from the surrounding well-vascularized mesenchyme. Using guanidine extracts of fetal bovine cartilage, we have identified and purified chondromodulin-I (ChM-I) as an angiogenesis inhibitor. The cDNA sequence of this factor has revealed that the ChM-I precursor protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein (334 amino acids) and that mature ChM-I is encoded in the C-terminal region of the precursor. After cleavage of the ChM-I precursor at its processing site, mature ChM-I (120 amino acids) is secreted from chondrocytes into the extracellular matrix. Following on from the identification of ChM-I as an angiogenesis inhibitor in cartilage, we have also cloned both mouse and human tenomodulin (TeM), which share significant homology with ChM-I at their C-termini. Moreover, exogenous expression experiments in COS cells suggests that TeM is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein (317 amino acids). When overexpressed in HUVECs, the C-terminal domain (116 amino acids) of the TeM protein shows both anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities at equivalent levels to mature ChM-I.

{"title": "[Muscle flap transfer of the treatment of infected tibial and malleolar fractures and chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia].", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with infected fractures or chronic osteomyelitis in the tibial and ankle regions by radical debridement of skeletal and soft tissues and coverage of the defect, using free flap transfer or muscle flap transposition.\nBetween January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2004, 26 patients were treated by this method; 13 had infected tibial or ankle fractures and 13 showed osteomyelitis of the tibia. All patients, in the case of failure, would have been indicated for below-knee amputation. The group comprised six women and 20 men at an average age of 46 years (range, 10 to 67 years).\nIn this retrospective study, the following data were recorded: type of injury (multiple trauma, combined trauma, single trauma), fracture type according to the AO classification, grade of injury in open fractures by the Gustillo and Anderson classification, number of previous operations in patients with infected fractures, microbiological findings in all patients before defect coverage with a flap, interval between the injury and flap coverage, number of post-operative complications, number of subsequent operations, period of relief for the treated limb, actual weight-bearing of the limb, patient's satisfaction with the therapy.\nSince one patient died of heart attack during follow-up, 25 patients (5 women and 20 men) were included in the final evaluation. The average follow-up was 27 months (range, 15 to 49 months). The healing of infection and union of bone were recorded in 21 patients (84 %). Healing with pseudoarthrosis development occurred in three patients (12 %). One patient (4 %) had to undergo leg amputation due to persistent secretion. The duration of treatment before coverage of the defect was on average 10 weeks (range, 4 weeks to 6 months) in the patients with infected fractures, and 9 years (range, 2 to 20 years) in the patients with osteomyelitis. Post-operative complications were recorded in seven patients (27 %). Impaired vascularization of the flap in the early post-operative period was found in two patients (8 %). In two patients (8 %) residual infected tissue under the flap resulted in purulent secretion. In three patients (12 %), at the time of evaluation, the lower extremity could not bear weight due to non-union of fractured bone.\nThe use of free or transposition muscle is regarded as the optimal method for the treatment of extensive defects of soft tissues in limb traumatology. The advantages include: good quality coverage of the defect; ability of vascularized flap tissue to transport antibiotic to the defect area; long-term improved perfusion in the fracture region is important for fracture healing.\nThe treatment of infected tibial and malleolar fractures by debridement and subsequent coverage of soft tissue defects, using muscle flap transfer, permits elimination of infection in most of the patients, but often requires subsequent surgery in order to provide biological stimulation for healing of defective fractures. Treatment of osteomyelitis of the tibia by this method is demanding, but has a good prospect of healing in a period shorter than is necessary for treatment without muscle flap transfer.", "journal": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "date": "2007-07-12", "authors": ["ANejedl\u00fd", "VDzupa", "JZ\u00e1horka", "MTvrdek"], "doi": null}

Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with both antiangiogenic and antitumor activities due to selective inhibition of various receptor tyrosine kinases, including those important for angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors). Here we evaluated the antitumor activities of sunitinib on orthotopic models of GBM in vitro and in vivo. Sunitinib potently inhibited angiogenesis that was stimulated by implantation of U87MG and GL15 cells into organotypic brain slices at concentrations as low as 10 nM. At high dose (10 microM), sunitinib induced direct antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on GL15 cells and decreased invasion of these cells implanted into brain slices by 49% (p < 0.001). Treatment was associated with decreases in Src (35%) and focal adhesion kinase (44%) phosphorylation. However, anti-invasive activity was not observed in vivo at the highest dose level utilized (80 mg/kg per day). Survival experiments involving athymic mice bearing intracerebral U87MG GBM demonstrated that oral administration of 80 mg/kg sunitinib (five days on, two days off) improved median survival by 36% (p < 0.0001). Sunitinib treatment caused a 74% reduction in microvessel density (p < 0.05), an increase in tumor necrosis, and a decrease in number of GBM cells positive for MIB antibody.

Combined targeting of ET(A)R, by the specific ET(A)R antagonist ZD4054, and of EGFR by the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (IRESSA), may offer improvements in ovarian carcinoma treatment. In HEY and OVCA 433 ovarian carcinoma cells, ET-1 or EGF induced rapid activation of EGFR, p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT. ZD4054 was able to reduce the ET-1-induced EGFR transactivation. Gefitinib significantly inhibited EGF- and ET-1-induced EGFR phosphorylation, but incompletely reduced the ET-1-induced activation of downstream targets. ZD4054 plus gefitinib resulted in a greater inhibition of EGFR, MAPK, and AKT phosphorylation, indicating the critical role of these interconnected signaling proteins. ZD4054 effectively inhibited cell proliferation, invasiveness, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion.

In both cell lines, the drug combination resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation (65%), invasion (52%), and VEGF production (50%), accompanied by a 2-fold increase in apoptosis. The coadministration of ZD4054 enhanced the efficacy of gefitinib leading to partial (82%) or complete tumor regression on HEY ovarian carcinoma xenografts.

AMD is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries and current treatment regimes have potential to cause collateral damage, or do not remove pre-existing unwanted vasculature. It has been proposed that two-photon excitation (TPE) photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be applied to cause local blood vessel occlusion without damaging surrounding retinal tissues. The in ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is used as the model for vascularization in the wet form of AMD; novel techniques for the utilization of the CAM are reported. Complete occlusion of CAM vessels approximately 15 microm in diameter is achieved using the clinically approved photosensitizer Verteporfin (Visudyne, QLT, Incorporated, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and TPE activation. The average and peak irradiances used for treatment are 3.3x10(6) Wcm(2) and 3.7x10(11) Wcm(2), respectively. A total fluence of 1.1x10(8) Jcm(2) is the dosage required for successful occlusion, and it is expected that for optimal conditions it will be much less. These results are the first proof-of-principle evidence in the literature that indicate TPE-PDT can be used to occlude small blood vessels.

{"title": "Simultaneous differentiation of endothelial and trophoblastic cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Here we present a simple two-step in vitro model of vascularized trophoblastic tissue derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells. The first step is the formation of cystic embryoid bodies (EBs) in suspension in a semisolid methyl cellulose medium, within which an endothelial platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1(+)) cell network develops. In a second step, deposition of these EBs on the bottom of nontreated, polystyrene tissue culture plates, leads by centrifugal outgrowth of the EB to the emergence of an adherent cell layer, with which a PECAM-1(+) network is associated. Cells of this adherent layer expressed VE-cadherin (CD144), PECAM-1 (CD31), and alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP). Trophoblastic differentiation was strongly suggested by the secretion of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and by the presence of the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast marker GB25. The INSL4 gene, a cyto and syncytio-trophoblast marker, was also highly expressed in the adherent layer, as well as other trophoblast genes such as CGA, CDX1, CDX2, and HAND1, compared to hES cell gene expression taken as reference. In contrast, expression of self-renewal genes, such as TERT, POU5F1, ZFP42, GDF3, and NODAL were decreased. No ectodermal or endodermal genes were expressed, but the mesodermal genes PECAM-1 and GATA2 were. The possibility of removing the EBs during the second step would permit analysis of their relative contribution to angiogenesis or possible hemangioblast formation, compared to that of the trophoblastic adherent layer.

While useful in clinical practice, patients taking GCs often suffer from skeletal side effects including growth retardation in children and adolescents, and decreased bone quality in adults. On a physiological level, GCs have been implicated in the regulation of chondrogenesis and osteoblast differentiation, as well as maintaining homeostasis in cartilage and bone. We identified the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a potential regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy in a microarray screen of primary limb bud mesenchyme micromass cultures. Some targets of GC regulation in chondrogenesis are known, but the global effects of pharmacological GC doses on chondrocyte gene expression have not been comprehensively evaluated.\nThis study systematically identifies a spectrum of GC target genes in embryonic growth plate chondrocytes treated with a synthetic GR agonist, dexamethasone (DEX), at 6 and 24 hrs. Conventional analysis of this data set and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. Transcripts associated with metabolism were enriched in the DEX condition along with extracellular matrix genes. In contrast, a subset of growth factors and cytokines were negatively correlated with DEX treatment. Comparing DEX-induced gene expression data to developmental changes in gene expression in micromass cultures revealed an additional layer of complexity in which DEX maintains the expression of certain chondrocyte marker genes while inhibiting factors that promote vascularization and ultimately ossification of the cartilaginous template.\nTogether, these results provide insight into the mechanisms and major molecular classes functioning downstream of DEX in primary chondrocytes. In addition, comparison of our data with microarray studies of DEX treatment in other cell types demonstrated that the majority of DEX effects are tissue-specific. This study provides novel insights into the effects of pharmacological GC on chondrocyte gene transcription and establishes the foundation for subsequent functional studies.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2007-07-03", "authors": ["Claudine GJames", "VeronicaUlici", "JanTuckermann", "T MichaelUnderhill", "FrankBeier"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-8-205\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00157-0\n10.1002/bdrc.10016\n10.1002/art.20611\n10.1053/joca.2001.0447\n10.1101/gad.9.22.2821\n10.1038/ng0697-174\n10.1006/dbio.1996.8487\n10.1038/nature01657\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.10.1647\n10.1006/excr.1997.3576\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199612)180:4<430::AID-PATH691>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00855-4\n10.1677/joe.0.1800247\n10.1210/en.139.7.3296\n10.1159/000064764\n10.1146/annurev.ph.43.030181.001301\n10.1016/S1063-4584(03)00187-0\n10.1016/0960-0760(95)00065-8\n10.1016/S8756-3282(99)00245-8\n10.1210/er.2002-0033\n10.1016/S0959-437X(98)80007-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01511.x\n10.1677/joe.0.1810105\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1608\n10.1677/joe.0.1750705\n10.1002/jcb.10396\n10.1210/jc.85.2.883\n10.1002/jcb.240500411\n10.1210/en.138.7.2820\n10.1210/en.137.8.3401\n10.1677/joe.0.1690573\n10.1007/s00223-001-0043-0\n10.1203/01.pdr.0000214966.60416.1b\n10.1186/1471-2474-7-87\n10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00276-9\n10.1091/mbc.E05-01-0084\n10.1038/ng1180\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0415\n10.1677/joe.0.1570225\n10.1007/s004670000344\n10.1677/jme.0.0300359\n10.1677/jme.1.02183\n10.1073/pnas.85.3.767\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.049\n10.1074/jbc.M412911200\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0183i.x\n10.1080/713713644\n10.1007/s00223-002-2047-9\n10.1002/jcp.20864\n10.1677/joe.1.06609\n10.1006/cyto.2002.2002\n10.1002/art.22175\n10.1016/j.tice.2005.03.002\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00466.x\n10.1007/s10735-004-3839-1\n10.1210/en.2002-220769\n10.1210/en.2003-0990\n10.1042/BJ20030874\n10.1083/jcb.106.6.2139\n10.1242/dev.01053\n10.1084/jem.20060336\n10.1186/1471-2199-5-2\n10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00321-X\n10.1210/en.139.5.2423\n10.1074/jbc.M508027200\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2005.06.034\n10.1182/blood-2003-03-0923\n10.1073/pnas.0407008101\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2546\n10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00361-3\n10.1371/journal.pgen.0010016\n10.1152/ajpgi.00454.2004\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.09.009\n10.1183/09031936.06.00125404\n10.1038/sj.leu.2403516\n10.1093/hmg/ddi229\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0703272\n10.1016/S0039-128X(01)00171-4\n10.1096/fj.03-0328com\n10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.185\n10.1016/0022-4731(89)90521-9"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of Skull Base and Fronto-orbital Defects following Tumor Resection.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the anterior skull base and fronto-orbital framework following extensive tumor resection is both challenging and controversial. Dural defects are covered with multiple sheets of fascia lata that provide sufficient support and avoid herniation. Plating along the skull base is contraindicated. After resection of orbital walls, grafting is necessary if the periosteum or parts of the periorbital tissue had to be removed, to avoid enophthalmus or strabism. Free bone grafts exposed to the sinonasal or pharyngeal cavity are vulnerable to infection or necrosis: therefore, covering the grafts with vascularized tissue, such as the Bichat fat-pad or pedicled temporalis flaps, should reduce these complications. Alloplastic materials are indispensable in cranial defects, whereas microsurgical free tissue transfer is indicated in cases of orbital exenteration and skin defects.

Limited dural defects were closed primarily or reconstructed using a temporalis fascia. Large anterior skull base defects were reconstructed by a double-layer fascia lata graft. A split calvarial bone graft, posterior frontal sinus wall, or three-dimensional titanium mesh were used when the tumor involved the frontal, nasal, or orbital bones. A temporalis muscle flap was used to cover the orbital socket for cases of eye globe exenteration, and a rectus abdominis free flap was used for subcranial-orbitomaxillary resection. Pericranial flap wrapping of the frontonaso-orbital segment was performed to prevent osteoradionecrosis if perioperative radiotherapy was planned.\nThe incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, intracranial infection, and tension pneumocephalus was 5%. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of fascia lata grafts in reoperated patients (n = 7) revealed integration of vascularized fibrous tissue to the graft and local proliferation of a newly formed vascular layer embedding the fascial sheath.\nA double-layer fascial graft alone was adequate for preventing CSF leak, meningitis, tension pneumocephalus, and brain herniation.

At our institution, the use of vascularized, free-tissue transfer has replaced pedicled flaps as the preferred modality for reconstructing complex cranial base defects involving resection of dura, brain, or multiple major structures adjacent to skull base, including the orbit, palate, mandible, skin, and other structures. The goals of reconstruction are to: (1) support the brain and orbit; (2) separate the CNS from the aerodigestive tract; (3) provide lining for the nasal cavity; (4) re-establish the nasal and oropharyngeal cavities; (5) provide volume to decrease dead space; and (6) restore the three-dimensional appearance of the face and head with bone and soft tissues. Surgical management requires a multidisciplinary effort with collaborating neurosurgical, head and neck, and plastic surgical teams. Successful reconstruction of skull base defects is predicated upon a careful appreciation of the specific region.

{"title": "Partial rescue of glomerular laminin alpha5 mutations by wild-type endothelia produce hybrid glomeruli.", "abstract": "Both endothelial cells and podocytes are sources for laminin alpha1 at the inception of glomerulogenesis and then for laminin alpha5 during glomerular maturation. Why glomerular basement membranes (GBM) undergo laminin transitions is unknown, but this may dictate glomerular morphogenesis. In mice that genetically lack laminin alpha5, laminin alpha5beta2gamma1 is not assembled, vascularized glomeruli fail to form, and animals die at midgestation with neural tube closure and placental deficits. It was previously shown that renal cortices of newborn mice contain endothelial progenitors (angioblasts) and that when embryonic day 12 kidneys are transplanted into newborn kidney, hybrid glomeruli (host-derived endothelium and donor-derived podocytes) result. Reasoning that host endothelium may correct the glomerular phenotype that is seen in laminin alpha5 mutants, alpha5 null embryonic day 12 metanephroi were grafted into wild-type newborn kidney. Hybrid glomeruli were identified in grafts by expression of a host-specific LacZ lineage marker. Labeling of glomerular hybrid GBM with chain-specific antibodies showed a markedly stratified distribution of laminins: alpha5 was found only on the inner endothelial half of GBM, whereas alpha1 located to outer layers beneath mutant podocytes. For measurement of the contribution of host endothelium to hybrid GBM, immunofluorescent signals for laminin alpha5 were quantified: Hybrid GBM contained approximately 50% the normal alpha5 complement as wild-type GBM. Electron microscopy of glomerular hybrids showed vascularization, but podocyte foot processes were absent. It was concluded that (1) endothelial and podocyte-derived laminins remain tethered to their cellular origin, (2) developing endothelial cells contribute large amounts of GBM laminins, and (3) podocyte foot process differentiation may require direct exposure to laminin alpha5.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2007-06-30", "authors": ["Dale RAbrahamson", "Patricia LSt John", "KathrynIsom", "BarryRobert", "Jeffrey HMiner"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2007020207"}
{"title": "In vivo imaging in experimental preclinical tumor research--a review.", "abstract": "The multiparametric molecular cell and tissue analysis in vitro and in vivo is characterized by rapid progress in the field of image generation technologies, sensor biotechnology, and computational modeling. Fascinating new potentials in unraveling the detailed functions of single cells, organs, and whole organisms are presently emerging and permit the close monitoring i.e. tumor development or basic cell development processes with an unprecedented multiplicity of promising investigative possibilities. To answer basic questions of in vivo tumor development and progression fluorescence based imaging techniques provide new insights into molecular pathways and targets. Genetic reporter systems (eGFP, DsRED) are available and high sensitive detection systems are on hand. These techniques could be used for in vitro assays and quantified e.g. by microscopy and CCD based readouts. The introduction of novel fluorescent dyes emitting in the near infrared range (NIR) combined with the development of sensitive detector systems and monochromatic powerful NIR-lasers for the first time permits the quantification and imaging of fluorescence and/or bioluminescence in deeper tissues. Laser based techniques particularly in the NIR-range (like two-photon microscopy) offer superb signal to noise ratios, and thus the potential to detect molecular targets in vivo. In combination with flat panel volumetric computed tomography (fpVCT), questions dealing e.g. with tumor size, tumor growth, and angiogenesis/vascularization could be answered noninvasively using the same animal. The resolution of down to 150 microm/each direction can be achieved using fpVCT. It is demonstrated by many groups that submillimeter resolutions can be achieved in small animal imaging at high sensitivity and molecular specificity. Since the resolution in preclinical small animal imaging is down to approximately 10 microm by the use of microCT and to subcellular resolutions using ( approximately 1 microm) microscope based systems, the advances of different techniques can now be combined to \"multimodal\" preclinical imaging and the possibilities for in vivo intravital cytometry now become within one's reach.", "journal": "Cytometry.

{"title": "New insights on Saccus vasculosus evolution: a developmental and immunohistochemical study in elasmobranchs.", "abstract": "The saccus vasculosus (SV) is a circumventricular organ of the hypothalamus of many jawed fishes whose functions have not yet been clarified. It is a vascularized neuroepithelium that consists of coronet cells, cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-c) neurons and supporting cells. To assess the organization, development and evolution of the SV, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the neuronal markers gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; the GABA synthesizing enzyme), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurophysin II (NPH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; the rate-limiting catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme) and serotonin (5-HT), were investigated by immunohistochemistry in developing and adult sharks. Coronet cells showed GFAP immunoreactivity from embryos at stage 31 to adults, indicating a glial nature. GABAergic CSF-c neurons were evidenced just when the primordium of the SV becomes detectable (at stage 29). Double immunolabeling revealed colocalization of NPY and GAD in these cells. Some CSF-c cells showed TH immunoreactivity in postembryonic stages. Saccofugal GABAergic fibers formed a defined SV tract from the stage 30 and scattered neurosecretory (NPH-immunoreactive) and monoaminergic (5-HT- and TH-immunoreactive) saccopetal fibers were first detected at stages 31 and 32, respectively. The early differentiation of GABAergic neurons and the presence of a conspicuous GABAergic saccofugal system are shared by elasmobranch and teleosts (trout), suggesting that GABA plays a key function in the SV circuitry. Monoaminergic structures have not been reported in the SV of bony fishes, and were probably acquired secondarily in sharks.

In eight cases of early CXPA (intracapsular and minimally invasive tumors), eight of advanced CXPA (widely invasive tumors), and ten of PA without malignant transformation, tumor vascularization was assessed in histological samples by measuring total microvascular area (TVA) and microvessel density (MVD) using CD34 and CD105 antibodies. MVD for CD105 increased significantly during tumor progression, whereas this was not the case for CD34 MVD. Comparing widely invasive CXPA with and without myoepithelial differentiation, CXPA with myoepithelial differentiation showed a significantly lower number of CD105 positive vessels but revealed higher TVA values. In these tumors, the neoplastic cells usually formed larger hypovascularized aggregates that were often surrounded by large-sized vessels.

This thermal and mechanical trauma to adjacent bone tissue can result in the untoward consequences of cell death and eventually in a delay in healing.\nMurine tibial corticotomies were performed using a conventional saw and a Ti:Sapphire plasma-generated laser that removes tissue with minimal thermal damage. Our analyses began 24 hours after injury and proceeded to postsurgical day 6. We investigated aspects of wound repair ranging from vascularization, inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and bone remodeling.\nHistology of mouse corticotomy sites uncovered a significant difference in the onset of bone healing; whereas laser corticotomies showed abundant bone matrix deposition at postsurgical day 6, saw corticotomies only exhibited undifferentiated tissue. Our analyses uncovered that cutting bone with a saw caused denaturation of the collagen matrix due to thermal effects. This denatured collagen represented an unfavorable scaffold for subsequent osteoblast attachment, which in turn impeded deposition of a new bony matrix. The matrix degradation induced a prolonged inflammatory reaction at the cut edge to create a surface favorable for osteochondroprogenitor cell attachment. Laser corticotomies were absent of collagen denaturation, therefore osteochondroprogenitor cell attachment was enabled shortly after surgery.\nIn summary, these data demonstrate that corticotomies performed with Ti:Sapphire lasers are associated with a reduced initial inflammatory response at the injury site leading to accelerated osteochondroprogenitor cell migration, attachment, differentiation, and eventually matrix deposition.", "journal": "Annals of surgery", "date": "2007-06-27", "authors": ["PhilippLeucht", "KentsonLam", "Jae-BeomKim", "Mark AMackanos", "Dmitrii MSimanovskii", "Michael TLongaker", "Christopher HContag", "H AlanSchwettman", "Jill AHelms"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sla.0000258559.07435.b3"}

{"title": "Strategies to enhance capillary formation inside biomaterials: a computational study.", "abstract": "Control over angiogenesis (formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels) is often a crucial requirement for implantable porous biomaterials serving as scaffolds for tissue regeneration. Angiogenesis is influenced by the transport of chemoattractants such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the implant. To investigate this influence, we developed a computational model of capillary formation based on endothelial cell migration by modeling the random motion of sprout tips biased along spatially and temporally evolving concentration gradients of VEGF. The model focuses on the effect of diffusive VEGF transport inside a 2D domain on the directed migration of sprouts to test several chemical and physical strategies to stimulate and control angiogenesis. We considered a 2D porous membrane that is located between the primary vessel and a line source of VEGF. We assess the vascular network formed in 2 cases of a high and zero VEGF degradation rates applying 3 strategies of VEGF production: (1) only a line source; (2) a line source plus controlled release from a small number of VEGF sources that are randomly dispersed on the pore boundaries; and (3) a line source plus controlled release of VEGF from the pore boundaries themselves. Results show that in the limiting cases where VEGF degradation rate is relatively high, strategies 2 and 3 lead to a substantial increase in the number of vessels. This increase depends on the relative rates at which the line source and embedded sources or solid boundaries produce VEGF. Using strategy 2 results in a newly formed capillary network that is highly localized around the embedded sources. However, using strategy 3 leads to a more uniformly distributed vessel network and a higher degree of vessel ingrowth inside the porous membrane. In addition, the duration at which we engineer the embedded sources or pore boundaries to release VEGF determines the morphology of the capillary network. Although a higher release duration leads to a dense network of newly formed vessels near the primary vessel, it hinders further vessel penetration inside the porous membrane. Therefore, in applying both strategies 2 and 3, there is an optimum release duration that leads to a deeper penetration of vessels inside the membrane. It is hoped that insights from this study will aid in the design of materials with optimal structural and chemical properties to facilitate controlled angiogenesis.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-06-26", "authors": ["EhsanJabbarzadeh", "Cameron FAbrams"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.0057"}
{"title": "Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by p53: a new role for the guardian of the genome.", "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein has long been recognized as the central factor protecting humans from cancer. It has been famously dubbed \"the guardian of the genome\" due to its ability to respond to genotoxic stress, such as DNA damage and other stress signals, and to protect the genome by inducing a variety of biological responses including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. However, the tumor suppressive effects of p53 go far beyond its roles in mediating these three processes. There is growing evidence that p53 also exerts its effects on multiple aspects of tumor formation, including suppression of metastasis and, as summarized in this review, inhibition of new blood vessel development (angiogenesis). The p53 protein has been shown to limit angiogenesis by at least three mechanisms: (1) interfering with central regulators of hypoxia that mediate angiogenesis, (2) inhibiting production of proangiogenic factors, and (3) directly increasing the production of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. The combination of these effects allows p53 to efficiently shut down the angiogenic potential of cancer cells. Inactivation of p53, which occurs in approximately half of all tumors, reverses these effects; as a consequence, tumors carrying p53 mutations appear more vascularized and are often more aggressive and correlate with poor prognosis for treatment. Thus, the loss of functional p53 during tumorigenesis likely represents an essential step in the switch to an angiogenic phenotype that is displayed by aggressive tumors.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2007-06-26", "authors": ["Jose GTeodoro", "Sara KEvans", "Michael RGreen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-007-0221-2"}

Unfortunately, most if not all of these techniques are unable to recreate the appearance of natural-appearing hair on the reconstructed scalp. We present our unique experience utilizing a tissue-engineered dermal regeneration template for reconstruction of the traumatized scalp. Once vascularized and skin grafted, the neodermis received approximately 1600 microfollicular hair grafts, which resulted in a pleasing esthetic outcome. In this case, a 50-year-old man suffered a significant degloving of the posterior portion of the scalp.

In both cases osteoclasts (OCs) derived from the host were found on the implant surface. These results indicated that scaffolds with cells can be easily vascularized and confirmed the role of OBs in the definition of the microenvironment that induce blood marrow differentiation in the intratrabecular spaces.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2007-06-23", "authors": ["LuciaMancini", "RobertoTamma", "MariaSettanni", "ClaudiaCamerino", "NicolaPatano", "GiovanniGreco", "MaurizioStrippoli", "AlbertaZallone"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1402.008"}

The refinement of stem cell culture protocols to increase induction of the cardiomyocyte phenotype and the assembly of transplantable vascularized tissue are areas of intense current research, but the problem of immune rejection of heterologous cell type poses perhaps the most significant hurdle to overcome. This article focuses on the potential advantages and problems encountered with various stem cell sources for reconstruction of the damaged or failing myocardium or heart valves and also discusses the need for integrating advances in developmental and stem cell biology, immunology and tissue engineering to achieve the full potential of cardiac tissue engineering.

So far, myocutaneous flaps for wound closure after removal of malignant tumors are a well-accepted option, but there are only a few reports focusing on the primary closure of the perineal wound after proctocolectomy for Crohn's disease. We describe our experience with wide excision of the diseased perineum using a combined abdominoperineal two-team approach.\nWe performed proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy in five patients with longstanding extensive Crohn's disease. All five patients had fistulizing perineal Crohn's disease combined with Crohn's colitis. Each patient received at least one flap for primary wound closure, either a rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap or a gracilis flap.\nIndication for surgical intervention included anal or bowel stenosis, septic condition, fecal incontinence, or a combination of these features. One patient had a simultaneous adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Five patients underwent a total of seven flaps. Three months after surgery, complete healing was achieved in all patients; one patient suffered recurrence in the region of his right thigh. Mean follow up was 19.6 months (range-12-43 months).\nMyocutaneous flaps are a promising therapeutic option in patients with chronic perianal disease.

We now describe the use of an injectable, in situ cross-linkable synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) to deliver and grow cancer cells in vivo. The hyaluronan (HA)-derived sECMs were seeded with breast, colon, and ovarian cancer cells prior to gelation, and then injected subcutaneously into mammary fat pads, subserosally in colons, and intracapsularly in ovaries, respectively. Two cell lines were used for each type of cancer, and results were compared with orthotopic injection of cells in serum-free medium. At 4 weeks postinjection, four parameters were measured: (i) incidence and size of cancer at the injection site, (ii) vascularization or necrosis of new cancer tissue, (iii) cancer seeding in adjacent tissues, and (iv) metastasis to lymph nodes and other vital organs. In addition, the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) signaling pathway was analyzed immunohistochemically. Overall, orthotopic delivery of cancer cells in sECM hydrogels showed clear advantages: (i) increased incidence of cancer formation and reduced variability in tumor size, (ii) enhanced growth of organ-specific cancers with good tumor-tissue integration, (iii) improved vascularization and reduced necrosis within the tumor, (iv) reduced cancer seeding on adjacent tissues, and (v) better general health of animals.

To create a modular construct, instead of seeding a preformed scaffold, cells were encapsulated within sub-mm modules, and the outer surface of these modules was covered with a layer of endothelial cells. Modules were then added to a larger structure (here by filling a tube) to form the modular construct. Through a systematic process of materials selection, collagen, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, were identified as suitable components for module formation, at least for initial studies. A method, which involved cutting and shaping the modules within a tubular mold, was developed to fabricate sub-mm, cylindrical, collagen modules that contained viable, functioning HepG2 cells and that could be seeded with a surface layer of HUVECs. Module dimensions were reproducible and easily altered in a controlled fashion if desired. The module fabrication process developed here not only generated modules suitable for the assembly of a prototype modular construct, but also could potentially be used more generally for other applications for which the goal is to form submm-diameter cylinders from soft hydrogels.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-06-22", "authors": ["Alison PMcGuigan", "Michael VSefton"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.0253"}

However, the mechanisms involved in the context of the complex healing microenvironment are poorly understood. To evaluate the vascularization potential of bone biomaterials, angiogenic stimuli were added to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) growing on three-dimensional (3-D) bone biomaterials consisting of porous hydroxyapatite, porous calcium phosphate, porous nickel-titanium, successfully being used in humans, and also silk fibroin nets. HDMEC did not migrate to form microcapillary-like structures as they did on cell culture plastic. In cocultures of HDMEC and primary human osteoblast cells (HOS) or the human osteoblast-like cell line MG-63 on these biomaterials, a tissue-like self-assembly of cells occurred with time, with endothelial cells forming microcapillary-like structures containing a lumen and giving a strong PECAM-1 expression at cell interfaces. These microcapillary-like structures were intertwined between cell layers of osteoblasts and did not form when exogenous angiogenic stimuli were added to these cocultures. The life span of HDMEC was also significantly enhanced by coculture; with HDMEC being present for up to at least 42 days, compared to the monoculture where cells began to die rapidly after 1 week without passage. This coculture system may be applicable to a prevascularization strategy for biomaterials prior to implantation. Irrespective of this, the coculture model holds promise for studies to deepen our understanding of bone regeneration on 3-D substrates. Most importantly, these data raise important questions concerning the exact nature of pro-angiogenic drug- or gene-delivery systems to be incorporated into scaffolds.

We then applied the collagenase treatment regimen to patients with OSF.\nEndogenous collagenase activities in normal oral mucosa of patients exhibited 3- to 5-fold higher levels than that of OSF tissues. The collagenase treatment not only resulted in a significant improvement of oral opening, but patients also experienced a striking reduction in hypersensitivity to spices, sour, cold, and heat which helped restore eating function. Sub-mucosal fibrous proliferation, persistently good vascularization, and a mild increase in thickness of the sub-mucosal fibrous tissues were noticed 10 months after collagenase treatment. Within the 2-year follow-up period none of the treated patients developed an oral squamous cell carcinoma.\nA reduced content of functional collagenase observed in OSF mucosa of patients might be one mechanism responsible for collagen accumulation.

A folded free vascularized osteoseptocutaneous flap was harvested from the right fibula and transferred to the left tibial bone defect. After the reconstructive surgery, the patient obtained a solid union of the left tibial shaft uneventfully. Ten years later, he suffered intermittent pain on his right ankle. Plain radiographs revealed progressive tibiotalar osteoarthritis. Right ankle arthrodesis with crossed cannulated screws fixation and osteosynthesis of the fibula to the tibia and talus were performed. However, this procedure failed due to a deep infection and osteomyelitis. A revision of the failed ankle fusion was performed by using a vascularized iliac bone flap to strut the anterolateral aspect of the tibiotalar bone defect. A ventral plate fixation and supplementary onlay bone grafting were applied across the anterior aspect of the tibiotalar joint. At the 2-year follow-up, the patient had no pain and resumed his regular daily activities.\nHarvesting of the fibula may cause longterm ankle osteoarthritis that requires ankle arthrodesis.

However, responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. We describe here the activity of EXEL-7647 (XL647), a novel spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the EGF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase families, against both wild-type (WT) and mutant EGFR in vitro and in vivo.\nThe activity of EGFR inhibitors against WT and mutant EGFRs and their effect on downstream signal transduction was examined in cellular assays and in vivo using A431 and MDA-MB-231 (WT EGFR) and H1975 (L858R and T790M mutant EGFR) xenograft tumors.\nEXEL-7647 shows potent and long-lived inhibition of the WT EGFR in vivo.

However, the contribution and the functional role of EPCs in tumor neoangiogenesis are controversial. Therefore, by using genetically marked BM progenitor cells, we demonstrate the precise spatial and temporal contribution of EPCs to the neovascularization of three transplanted and one spontaneous breast tumor in vivo using high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry. We show that early tumors recruit BM-derived EPCs that differentiate into mature BM-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and luminally incorporate into a subset of sprouting tumor neovessels. Notably, in later tumors, these BM-derived vessels are diluted with non-BM-derived vessels from the periphery, which accounts for purported differences in previously published reports. Furthermore, we show that specific ablation of BM-derived EPCs with alpha-particle-emitting anti-VE-cadherin antibody markedly impaired tumor growth associated with reduced vascularization.

Morphological assessment of vascular corrosion casts, studied qualitatively and quantitatively, was applied for the first time to investigate the vascularization of the pigeon pigeon bursa of Fabricius. This also allowed us to analyse the microvasculature and morphological aspects of the vessel interrelationships as occurring in the natural state. The casts were compared with histological sections stained by haematoxylin-eosin and by binding of the lectin e-PHA (Phaseolus vulgaris, erythroagglutinin) to blood vessels. The vascular architecture of the bursa of Fabricius of the pigeon revealed that the organ is irrigated via two pathways, first through the terminal capillary system of lymphoid follicles arising from the internal pudendal artery, and secondly through arteries originating from the cloacal vasculature of the collum of the organ supplying the periluminal capillary system of the pigeon bursa of Fabricius. Both systems are drained by a venous system which is collateral to the system of the internal pudendal artery and clearly functions as a direct link between the lumen and vasculature of the cloaca or gut, respectively, and the bursa fabricii. This could allow the lymphocytes to be confronted with antigens from the contents of the gut, and their subsequent transport into the secondary lymphoid organs of the organism. Our results demonstrate that the blood vessels, as major and supplying part of the lymphoid system of the bursa Fabricii, clearly reflect three different phases of development: the evolution phase from about day 20 until day 50 post-hatching, the mature phase from days 50 to 90, and the involution phase after day 90. During the evolution phase the density of the vessel system rapidly increases, while in the mature phase the vascular architecture is maintained. The involution phase is dominated by vascular degeneration combined with shrinkage of the whole organ. Therefore, the morphology of the vasculature distinctly reflects the functional status of this primary lymphoid organ during its lifespan.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2007-06-19", "authors": ["FrancoAbbate", "ChristianePfarrer", "Carolyn J PJones", "EmiliaCiriaco", "GiovanniGerman\u00e0", "RudolfLeiser"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00763.x"}

The Ovol2 mutants died at embryonic days 9.5-10.5 (E9.5-E10.5), as a result of defects in extraembryonic and embryonic vascularization, and in heart formation.

Previous investigations have shown that under in vivo conditions primary human preadipocytes induce vascularization of fibrin matrices by secretion of several growth factors, such as VEGF and bFGF. The current study investigates whether vascularization of implants can be improved by transplantation of preadipocytes following transfection with a VEGF-vector. Transfection was performed by electroporation with an pCMX-GFP and pCMX-VEGF165 vector. Transfection efficiency (GFP expression) and VEGF expression were determined in vitro by FACS analysis and VEGF immunoassay, respectively. In vivo investigations to determine the vascularization of the implants were performed on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Four million VEGF transfected cells were transferred within a fibrin matrix onto the CAM on the 7(th) day of incubation and after 8 days the vascularization of the implant was histologically examined and evaluated by means of a computer-assisted image analysis program. Transfection of preadipocytes with the GFP vector by electroporation yielded transfection efficiencies between 12% and 41% of surviving cells. Results of the VEGF immunoassay demonstrated that VEGF expression was significantly higher following transfection. Investigations on the CAM outlined a significantly higher rate of vascularization in the transfected vs. control population. Our investigations demonstrate that primary human preadipocytes can be successfully transfected by electroporation with a VEGF vector.

Thus, one way to enable the early formation of a capillary network resulting in a sufficient perfusion of the transplanted construct might be the co-transplantation of autologous preadipocytes with endothelial cells. To investigate preadipocyte-endothelial cell interaction, three-dimensional proliferation- and angiogenesis assays were performed in vitro. Proliferation rates of co-cultured endothelial cells and preadipocytes suspended in a fibrin matrix were elucidated by Alamarblue assays. The spheroid angiogenesis model was applied for analyzing the effects of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (produced by preadipocytes) as well as the impact of cell-cell interaction between preadipocytes and endothelial cells and fibrin matrix on endothelial cell migration. Preadipocytes proliferated in fibrin glue, whereas endothelial cells underwent apoptosis. By co-culturing, both cell types demonstrated an increased proliferation rate. Preadipocytes provoked migration of endothelial cells. Blocking bFGF and/or VEGF led to a significant decrease of migration. Changes in fibrin structure were followed by migration of single cells instead of sprouting.

Reconstruction using vascularized bone graft is the accepted standard in cases of large osseous defects.\nAn anatomical vascular corrosion study with cadaveric dissections and finite element analyses was designed to assess the feasibility of clavicular reconstruction with a musculo-osteous graft interposition based on a pedicled serratus anterior flap.\nRib vascularization through the serratus anterior was demonstrated, so that the thoracic branch of the thoracodorsal artery can been considered a secondary blood supply for the seventh and eighth ribs. Single and double pedicled rib transfers allowed for reconstruction with as much as 8 cm of bone loss. The maximal stress found in the single-rib reconstruction interfaces was located at the medial contact of the plate with the clavicle. It was 2.7-fold higher than the maximal stress of the medial bow of the intact clavicle. Conversely, the double-rib reconstruction had improved mechanical resistance. A case report using a single-rib transfer supported the biomechanical study by showing that the maximal risk of material loosening was located at the medial bone interface.\nDouble vascularized rib transfer as part of a serratus anterior flap should be used instead of single-rib transfer to reconstruct large clavicle defects.

This article had for aim to define the importance and limits of this technique in the treatment of alopecia and to highlight its relevance compared to other methods.\nBetween November 1998 and April 2006, 18 patients (7 women and 11 men) presenting with one or many cicatricial alopecia areas were treated by skin expansion. The age of patients ranged between 14 and 68 years, with an average of 33 years. The indications were related to burn sequels in 44% of all cases. The average area of alopecia was 167 cm2. This technique combines two operating phases. In the first phase, the expansion balloon is inserted and then gradually filled. In the second phase, it is removed and the alopecic area is covered by the expanded flaps.\nThirty-nine expansion prostheses were used, with an average volume of 292 cc. Their number varied between 1 and 6 (two on average) for each patient. The average duration of expansion was 77 days. The tissue gained with this technique allowed the use of 38 flaps. The transposition flaps was the most frequently used (39.4%). The rate of major complications leading to total failure of the process reached 5.5%. The final result was considered good in 90% of the cases.\nThe results demonstrate that skin expansion technique is a simple, reliable, and efficient method in the healing of important cicatricial alopecia of scalp. It enables a wider use of the classical local flap technique, by expanding the surface and vascularization allowing for a direct suturing of the donor site.

The ability to control and reduce this phenomenon may have important therapeutic implications. Angiogenesis is a complex event which requires endothelial cell sprouting, lumen formation, tubulogenesis and is regulated by the coordinated action of different transcription factors. Studies on promoters of endothelial cell-specific genes or gene inactivation experiments reveal the extreme complexity of the system. Many transcription factors are implicated in vascular development and the majority are not endothelial-specific. Their interaction leads to endothelial cell differentiation and acquisition of arterial, venous and lymphatic properties. Two large families of transcription factors, Foxs and Ets, play a major role in these events. They participate in both embryonic and adult angiogenesis. The FoxO subgroup regulates the correct organization of the vascular system, controlling excessive endothelial growth and inducing apoptosis both in embryos and adult mice. Ets factors participate in early endothelial differentiation and angiogenesis. Many members of this family are expressed very early in the developing vasculature and Ets consensus binding domains are present in essentially all endothelial cell-specific gene promoters. In this review we discuss the overall transcriptional regulation of vascular development with a particular focus on some specific members of these two families considered important in the formation and maintenance of the vascular network.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2007-06-19", "authors": ["ElisabettaDejana", "AndreaTaddei", "Anna MRandi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.05.003"}

If substantiated, this concept would advance understanding of wound healing and aerobic angiogenesis because lactate accumulation has many aerobic sources. In this study, Matrigel plugs containing a powdered, hydrolyzable lactate polymer were implanted into the subcutaneous space of mice. Lactate monomer concentrations in the implant were consistent with wound levels for more than 11 days. They induced little inflammation but considerable VEGF production and were highly angiogenic, as opposed to controls. Arterial hypoxia abrogated angiogenesis. Furthermore, inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by using oxamate also prevented the angiogenic effects of lactate. Lactate monomer, at concentrations found in cutaneous wounds, stabilized HIF-1alpha and increased VEGF levels in aerobically cultured human endothelial cells.

To complement earlier studies that identified some of the paracrine factors, we profiled the paracrine proteome to better assess the relevance of MSC paracrine factors to the wide spectrum of MSC-mediated therapeutic effects. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the MSC paracrine proteome, a chemically defined serum-free culture medium was conditioned by MSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells using a clinically compliant protocol. The conditioned medium was analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology and cytokine antibody array analysis and revealed the presence of 201 unique gene products. 86-88% of these gene products had detectable transcript levels by microarray or quantitative RT-PCR assays. Computational analysis predicted that these gene products will significantly drive three major groups of biological processes: metabolism, defense response, and tissue differentiation including vascularization, hematopoiesis, and skeletal development. It also predicted that the 201 gene products activate important signaling pathways in cardiovascular biology, bone development, and hematopoiesis such as Jak-STAT, MAPK, Toll-like receptor, transforming growth factor-beta, and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.

To gain insight into the role PECAM-1 plays during vascular development and angiogenesis, we examined the expression pattern of PECAM-1 isoforms during kidney vascularization. We show that multiple isoforms of PECAM-1 are expressed during renal vascular development with different frequencies. The PECAM-1 that lacks exons 14 and 15 (Delta14&15) was the predominant isoform detected in the renal vasculature. To further study PECAM-1 isoform-specific functions we isolated kidney endothelial cells (EC) from wild-type and PECAM-1-deficient (PECAM-1-/-) mice with B(4)-lectin-coated magnetic beads. PECAM-1-/- kidney EC showed reduced migration, inability to undergo capillary morphogenesis in Matrigel, dense peripheral focal adhesions, and peripheral cortical actin distribution compared with wild-type cells. PECAM-1-/- kidney EC secreted increased amounts of fibronectin and decreased amounts of tenascin-C and thrombospondin-1. Reexpression of Delta14&15, but not full-length, PECAM-1 in PECAM-1-/- kidney EC restored cell migration and capillary morphogenesis defects. Thus PECAM-1 may regulate the adhesive and migratory properties of kidney EC in an isoform-specific fashion through modulation of integrin activity and extracellular matrix protein expression.

We investigated whether omental maturation of a seeded construct in a pig model could achieve terminal differentiation of the urothelium to allow construction of a stricture-free neoureter.\nBladder biopsies were taken to allow urothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures. These cultured cells were used to seed small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrix. After 2 wk of cell growth, the in vitro SIS-seeded construct was shaped around a silicone drain and wrapped by the omentum to obtain neoureters. These neoureters were left in the omentum without any contact with urine, and then harvested 3 wk later for histologic and immunohistochemical studies.\nBefore implantation, the in vitro constructs were composed of a mono- or bilayer of undifferentiated urothelium overlying a monolayer of smooth muscle cells. After 3 wk of omental maturation, these constructs were vascularized and comprised a terminally differentiated multilayered urothelium with umbrella cells over connective tissue and smooth muscle cells, with no evidence of fibrosis or inflammation.\nWe obtained, for the first time, with this model of in vivo maturation in the omentum, a mature neoureter composed of a well-differentiated multilayered urothelium.", "journal": "European urology", "date": "2007-06-15", "authors": ["Herv\u00e9Baumert", "DhouhaMansouri", "Ga\u00eblleFromont", "MehrakHekmati", "PascalSimon", "WalidMassoud", "VincentMolini\u00e9", "BernardMalavaud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.eururo.2007.04.098"}

Herein we studied how liver resection-associated MIP-2 affects extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment and whether MIP-2 also stimulates the growth of already established metastases.\nGreen fluorescent protein-transfected CT26.WT colorectal cancer cells were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of syngeneic BALB/c mice. Additionally, all animals underwent a 30% hepatectomy. To study MIP-2 in extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment, animals were treated with an anti-MIP-2 antibody, starting at the day of tumor cell implantation. To study MIP-2 in established metastases, anti-MIP-2 treatment was initiated at day 5 after tumor cell implantation. Hepatectomized animals without neutralization of MIP-2 served as controls. Tumor vascularization and growth as well as tumor cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and CXCR-2 expression were studied over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry.\nFunctional inhibition of MIP-2 significantly delayed extrahepatic tumor cell engraftment but not the growth of established metastases. The initial delay of engraftment was associated with a compensatory stimulation of vascularization and tumor cell migration when compared to controls (P < 0.05). Further, inhibition of tumor cell engraftment by initial anti-MIP-2 treatment was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of CXCR-2 expression and tumor cell apoptosis.\nOur study indicates that MIP-2 is involved in extrahepatic engraftment of CT.26 colorectal cancer cells.

Recent evidence demonstrates that the chemokine stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) has a major role in the recruitment and retention of CXCR4(+) BM cells to the neo-angiogenic niches supporting revascularization of ischemic tissue and tumor growth. However, the precise mechanism by which activation of CXCR4 modulates neo-angiogenesis is not clear. SDF-1 not only promotes revascularization by engaging with CXCR4 expressed on the vascular cells but also supports mobilization of pro-angiogenic CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) hematopoietic cells, thereby accelerating revascularization of ischemic organs. Here, we attempt to define the multiple functions of the SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling pathway in the regulation of neo-vascularization during acute ischemia and tumor growth. In particular, we introduce the concept that, by modulating plasma SDF-1 levels, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 acutely promotes, while chronic AMD3100 treatment inhibits, mobilization of pro-angiogenic cells. We will also discuss strategies to modulate the mobilization of essential subsets of BM cells that participate in neo-angiogenesis, setting up the stage for enhancing revascularization or targeting tumor vessels by exploiting CXCR4 agonists and antagonists, respectively.", "journal": "Trends in immunology", "date": "2007-06-15", "authors": ["IsabellePetit", "DavidJin", "ShahinRafii"], "doi": "10.1016/j.it.2007.05.007"}

In this study, we examined in vitro and in vivo, whether caffeic acid (CA) or its derivative CADPE [3-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-acrylic acid 2-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl ester] exert anticancer activity by targeting STAT3. It was found that CA or CADPE significantly inhibit STAT3 activity, and that this in turn down-regulates HIF-1alpha activity. Consequently, sequential blockade of STAT3 and HIF-1alpha resulted in the down-regulation of VEGF by inhibiting their recruitment to the VEGF promoter. In mice bearing a Caki-I carcinoma, both CA and CADPE retarded tumor growth and suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, HIF-1alpha expression, vascularization and STAT3-inducible VEGF gene expression in tumors.

{"title": "Involvement of marrow-derived endothelial cells in vascularization.", "abstract": "Until recently, the adult neovasculature was thought to arise only through angiogenesis, the mechanism by which new blood vessels form from preexisting vessels through endothelial cell migration and proliferation. However, recent studies have provided evidence that postnatal neovasculature can also arise though vasculogenesis, a process by which endothelial progenitor cells are recruited and differentiate into mature endothelial cells to form new blood vessels. Evidence for the existence of endothelial progenitors has come from studies demonstrating the ability of bone marrow-derived cells to incorporate into adult vasculature. However, the exact nature of endothelial progenitor cells remains controversial. Because of the lack of definitive markers of endothelial progenitors, the in vivo contribution of progenitor cells to physiological and pathological neovascularization remains unclear. Early studies reported that endothelial progenitor cells actively integrate into the adult vasculature and are critical in the development of many types of vascular-dependent disorders such as neoplastic progression. Moreover, it has been suggested that endothelial progenitor cells can be used as a therapeutic strategy aimed at promoting vascular growth in a variety of ischemic diseases. However, increasing numbers of studies have reported no clear contribution of endothelial progenitors in physiological or pathological angiogenesis. In this chapter, we discuss the origin of the endothelial progenitor cell in the embryo and adult, and we discuss the cell's link to the primitive hematopoietic stem cell.

Therefore, strategies aiming at the improvement of neovascularization of engineered tissues are a key issue. A method to enhance graft vascularization is to establish a primitive vascular plexus within the graft before transplantation by the use of cellular-based concepts. To explore the utility of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) for the ex vivo vascularization of tissue engineered grafts, we analyzed the in vitro angiogenic properties of this cell type in two different angiogenesis models: the 3-dimensional spheroid sprouting assay and the 2-dimensional matrigel assay. In both assays, EPCs were able to form tubelike structures, resembling early capillaries. This process was significantly enhanced by the addition of angiogenic growth factors. Direct comparison between EPCs and mature endothelial cells, represented by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), revealed that both cell types displayed an almost identical angiogenic potential. Other functional in vitro parameters such as angiogenic growth factor induced cell proliferation and cell survival were investigated as well, revealing a significantly decreased level of apoptosis of EPCs in relation to HUVECs under serum-deprived conditions. The observed survival advantage of EPCs along with the observation that EPCs perform very well in the above mentioned in vitro angiogenesis assays, make them an ideal autologous cell source for vascularization of ex vivo generated tissues.

{"title": "The hypoxia-inducible factor alpha pathway couples angiogenesis to osteogenesis during skeletal development.", "abstract": "Skeletal development and turnover occur in close spatial and temporal association with angiogenesis. Osteoblasts are ideally situated in bone to sense oxygen tension and respond to hypoxia by activating the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF alpha) pathway. Here we provide evidence that HIF alpha promotes angiogenesis and osteogenesis by elevating VEGF levels in osteoblasts. Mice overexpressing HIF alpha in osteoblasts through selective deletion of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (Vhl) expressed high levels of Vegf and developed extremely dense, heavily vascularized long bones. By contrast, mice lacking Hif1a in osteoblasts had the reverse skeletal phenotype of that of the Vhl mutants: long bones were significantly thinner and less vascularized than those of controls. Loss of Vhl in osteoblasts increased endothelial sprouting from the embryonic metatarsals in vitro but had little effect on osteoblast function in the absence of blood vessels. Mice lacking both Vhl and Hif1a had a bone phenotype intermediate between those of the single mutants, suggesting overlapping functions of HIFs in bone.

The present study evaluated all patients who were stratified to repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) from 1999 until 2003 in terms of tumor response, toxicity, and survival. A moderate embolizing approach was chosen using a combination of degradable starch microspheres (DSM) and iodized oil (Lipiodol) in order to combine anti-tumoral efficiency and low toxicity.\nFourty-seven patients were followed up prospectively. TACE treatment consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m(2)), doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), 450-900 mg DSM, and 5-30 ml Lipiodol. DSM and Lipiodol were administered according to tumor vascularization. Patient characteristics, toxicity, and complications were outlined. In multivariate regression analyses of pre-treatment variables from a prospective database, predictors for tumor response and survival after TACE were determined.\n112 TACE courses were performed (2.4+/-1.5 courses per patient). Mean maximum tumor size was 75 (+/-43) mm, in 68% there was bilobar disease. Best response to TACE treatment was: progressive disease (PD) 9%, stable disease (SD) 55%, partial remission (PR) 36%, and complete remission (CR) 0%. Multivariate regression analyses identified tumor size <or=75 mm, tumor number <or=5, and tumor hypervascularization as predictors for PR. The overall 1-, 2-, and 3-year-survival rates were 75%, 59%, and 41%, respectively, and the median survival was 26 months. Low alpha-fetoprotein levels (<400 ng/ml) (Odds ratio=3.3) and PR as best response to TACE (Odds ratio=6.7) were significantly associated with long term survival (>30 months, R(2)=36%). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 7.1% (n=8), and grade 4 toxicity in 3.6% (n=4) of all courses in terms of reversible leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The incidence of major complications was 5.4% (n=6). All complications were managed conservatively. The mortality within 6 weeks after TACE was 2.1% (one patient).\nDSM and Lipiodol were combined successfully in the palliative TACE treatment of advanced HCC resulting in high rates of tumor response and survival at limited toxicity. Favourable tumor response was associated with tumor extent and vascularization.

To evaluate the efficacy of the blood-derived factors in wound healing, we examined a novel wound dressing consisting of concentrated human plasma proteins and platelet releasate (CPPP).\nTo generate CPPP, plasma proteins and platelets in the peripheral blood (n = 5) were concentrated with the cold ethanol precipitation method. The thrombin obtained from the same blood unit and calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) were mixed to a concentrate.

ACTIBIND, a T2 RNase, exerts antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic activities by competing with the angiogenic factor angiogenin (itself an RNase homologue). Thus, there was decreased expression and activity of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 in melanoma and vascular endothelial cells, decreased vascularization, and increased tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. ACTIBIND significantly inhibited angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis assay with sponges containing angiogenin. In vitro, ACTIBIND was internalized by both melanoma and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, reached the cell nuclei, and inhibited the activity of angiogenin response elements in a dose-dependent manner.

{"title": "Effect of chemical stabilizers of hypoxia-inducible factors on early lung development.", "abstract": "Low oxygen stimulates pulmonary vascular development and airway branching and involves hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF is stable and initiates expression of angiogenic factors under hypoxia, whereas normoxia triggers hydroxylation of the HIF-1alpha subunit by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and subsequent degradation. Herein, we investigated whether chemical stabilization of HIF-1alpha under normoxic (20% O(2)) conditions would stimulate vascular growth and branching morphogenesis in early lung explants. Tie2-LacZ (endothelial LacZ marker) mice were used for visualization of the vasculature. Embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) lung buds were dissected and cultured in 20% O(2) in the absence or presence of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2), a hypoxia mimetic), dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG; a nonspecific inhibitor of PHDs), or desferrioxamine (DFO; an iron chelator). Vascularization was assessed by X-gal staining, and terminal buds were counted. The fine vascular network surrounding the developing lung buds seen in control explants disappeared in CoCl(2)- and DFO-treated explants. Also, epithelial branching was reduced in the explants treated with CoCl(2) and DFO. In contrast, DMOG inhibited branching but stimulated vascularization. Both DFO and DMOG increased nuclear HIF-1alpha protein levels, whereas CoCl(2) had no effect. Since HIF-1alpha induces VEGF expression, the effect of SU-5416, a potent VEGF receptor (VEGFR) blocker, on early lung development was also investigated. Inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling in explants maintained under hypoxic (2% O(2)) conditions completely abolished vascularization and slightly decreased epithelial branching. Taken together, the data suggest that DMOG stabilization of HIF-1alpha during early development leads to a hypervascular lung and that airway branching proceeds without the vasculature, albeit at a slower rate.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Here we identify Fgf9 as a second FGF ligand that is critical for skeletal development. We show that Fgf9 is expressed in the proximity of developing skeletal elements and that Fgf9-deficient mice exhibit rhizomelia (a disproportionate shortening of proximal skeletal elements), which is a prominent feature of patients with FGFR3-induced chondrodysplasia syndromes. Although Fgf9 is expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge in the limb bud, we demonstrate that the Fgf9-/- limb phenotype results from loss of FGF9 functions after formation of the mesenchymal condensation.

Up to 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.5% was injected.\nIn all patients, HRUI allowed clear delineation of the upper part of the interscalene brachial plexus at the level of the 4th cervical vertebra appearing as 1 hypoechoic, roundish, hypodense node located in a distance of 1.5 +/- 0.3 cm to the skin, 1.5 +/- 0.2 cm lateral to the common carotid artery, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 cm from the transverse process of the spine. Likewise HRUI allowed a clear delineation of minor blood vessels and adjacent anatomic structures, as well as accurate placement of the needle close to the nerves. Real-time observation of LA spread during injection was possible, even in increments of less than 1 mL.\nHigh-resolution ultrasonic imaging allows clear depiction of the target tissues and facilitates accurate needle placement during high interscalene brachial-plexus blocks. This technique may minimize the risk of direct puncture-related complications, as well as accidental intravascular injection of LA. The observation of LA spread in all patients, even in small increments of less than 1 mL might enhance safety by limiting the injected LA to the actual demand.

Using the specifically expressed annexin A5-LacZ fusion gene (Anxa5-LacZ), it became possible to isolate perivascular cells (PVC) from mouse tissues. These cells proliferate and can be cultured without undergoing senescence for multiple passages. PVC display phenotypic characteristics of pericytes, as they express pericyte-specific markers (NG2-proteoglycan, desmin, alphaSMA, PDGFR-beta). They also express stem cell marker Sca-1, whereas endothelial (PECAM), hematopoietic (CD45) or myeloid (F4/80, CD11b) lineage markers are not detectable. These characteristics are in common with the pericyte-like cell line 10T1/2. PVC also display a phagocytoic activity higher than 10T1/2 cells. During coculture with endothelial cells both cell types stimulate angiogenic processes indicated by an increased expression of PECAM in endothelial cells and specific deposition of basement membrane proteins. PVC show a significantly increased induction of endothelial specific PECAM expression compared to 10T1/2 cells. Accordingly, in vivo grafts of PVC aggregates onto chorioallantoic membranes of quail embryos recruit endothelial cells, get highly vascularized and deposit basement membrane components.

{"title": "Scaling mass and morphology in leaves: an extension of the WBE model.", "abstract": "Recent advances in metabolic scaling theory have highlighted the importance of exchange surfaces and vascular network geometry in understanding the integration and scaling of whole-plant form and function. Additional work on leaf form and function has also highlighted general scaling relationships for many leaf traits. However, it is unclear if a common theoretical framework can reveal the general rules underlying much of the variation observed in scaling relationships at the whole-plant and leaf level. Here we present an extension of the general model introduced by G. B. West, J. H. Brown, and B. J. Enquist that has previously been applied to scaling phenomena for whole plants to predict scaling relationships in leaves. Specifically, the model shows how the exponents that describe the scaling of leaf surface area, length, and petiole diameter should change with increasing leaf mass (or with one another) and with variation in leaf dimensionality. The predictions of the model are tested and found to be in general agreement with a large data set of leaves collected from both temperate and arid sites. Our results demonstrate that a general model based on the scaling properties of biological distribution networks can also be successfully applied to understand the diversity of leaf form and function.", "journal": "Ecology", "date": "2007-06-01", "authors": ["Charles APrice", "Brian JEnquist"], "doi": "10.1890/06-1158"}
{"title": "Microvascular architecture of the near-term uterine caruncles in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).", "abstract": "The present investigation was carried out on five near-term pregnant water buffaloes for studying the microvascular architecture of the uterine caruncles. The vascular casts were obtained by injection of 4:1 mixture of mercox and methylmethacrylate through the branches of the uterine arteries. After complete polymerization of the plastic, corrosion was conducted in 20% potassium hydroxide, then the vessel casts were immersed in distilled water, cut into small pieces, sputter coated with gold, and examined by using a scanning electron microscope. The buffalo uterine caruncle is highly vascularized through two slightly convoluted arteries and a single less tortuous vein. The arteries branch into several stem arteries at the base of the uterine caruncle, which follow nearly straight course in the primary septa towards the fetal side. During the courses of these stem arteries arterioles of variable diameters arise. The arterioles run in the secondary and tertiary septae and at this location arterioles and venules are connected through a voluminous capillary complex. The latter consists of capillaries of greatly variable diameters with vigorous coiling and sinusoidally dilated zones. From the capillary complexes the blood is driven through postcapillary venules back to the tertiary, secondary and primary septa, respectively, and then converge into stem veins which leave the caruncles through the branches of the uterine vein.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2007-05-31", "authors": ["M M MAbd-Elnaeim", "M AMiglino", "RLeiser"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00761.x"}

Lung histopathology of C57BL/6 (WT) mice 16 weeks after aerosol infection with Mycobacterium avium strain TMC724 is uniquely characterized by centrally necrotizing granulomas, strongly resembling human TB lesions. However, IFN-gamma-deficient (GKO) and IFN-gamma-receptor-deficient (GRKO) mice did not develop granuloma necrosis following M. avium infection. Comparison of differentially expressed genes in infected WT and GKO lungs by DNA microarray and RNase protection assays revealed that the angiostatic chemokines CXCL9-11 were significantly reduced in GKO mice. In contrast, angiogenic mediators such as angiopoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenic chemokines such as CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, remained unchanged or were expressed at higher levels than in infected WT mice, suggesting impaired neovascularization of the granuloma as a possible mechanism for caseation in WT mice. Granuloma vascularization was significantly decreased in central, but not peripheral, areas of granulomas of infected WT compared to GKO mice. In contrast to GRKO mice, WT mice showed signs of severe hypoxia in cells immediately surrounding the necrotic core of granulomas as measured immunohistochemically with a reagent detecting pimonidazole adducts. To test the hypothesis that CXCR3, the common receptor for the angiostatic chemokines CXCL9-11, is involved in granuloma caseation, histomorphology was assessed in M. avium-infected mice deficient for CXCR3 (CXCR3-KO). 16 weeks after infection, these mice developed caseating granulomas similar to WT mice. We conclude that IFN-gamma causes a dysbalance between angiostatic and angiogenic mediators and a concomitant reduction in granuloma vascularization, but that CXCR3-targeted chemokines are not sufficient to induce granuloma necrosis in a mouse model of mycobacteria-induced immunopathology.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2007-05-31", "authors": ["SAly", "TLaskay", "JMages", "AMalzan", "RLang", "SEhlers"], "doi": "10.1002/path.2185"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis is associated with blood-brain barrier permeability in temporal lobe epilepsy.", "abstract": "Previous studies from our group, focusing on neuro-glial remodelling in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), have shown the presence of immature vascular cells in various areas of the hippocampus. Here, we investigated angiogenic processes in hippocampi surgically removed from adult patients suffering from chronic intractable TLE, with various aetiologies. We compared hippocampi from TLE patients to hippocampi obtained after surgery or autopsy from non-epileptic patients (NE). We quantified the vascular density, checked for the expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors and looked for any blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. We used a relevant model of rat limbic epilepsy, induced by lithium-pilocarpine treatment, to understand the sequence of events. In humans, the vessel density was significantly higher in TLE than in NE patients. This was neither dependent on the aetiology nor on the degree of neuronal loss, but was positively correlated with seizure frequency. In the whole hippocampus, we observed many complex, tortuous microvessels. In the dentate gyrus, when the granular layer was dispersed, long microvessels appeared radially orientated. Vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) and tyrosine kinase receptors were detected in different types of cells. An impairment of the BBB was demonstrated by the loss of tight junctions and by Immunoglobulines G (IgG) leakage and accumulation in neurons. In the rat model of TLE, VEGF over-expression and BBB impairment occurred early after status epilepticus, followed by a progressive increase in vascularization. In humans and rodents, angiogenic processes and BBB disruption were still obvious in the chronic focus, probably activated by recurrent seizures. We suggest that the persistent leakage of serum IgG in the interstitial space and their uptake by neurons may participate in hypoperfusion and in neuronal dysfunction occurring in TLE.", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "date": "2007-05-30", "authors": ["Val\u00e9rieRigau", "M\u00e9lanieMorin", "Marie-ClaudeRousset", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricde Bock", "AuroreLebrun", "PhilippeCoubes", "Marie-ChristinePicot", "MichelBaldy-Moulinier", "Jo\u00eblBockaert", "ArielleCrespel", "MireilleLerner-Natoli"], "doi": "10.1093/brain/awm118"}

There was no seric alteration of specific pancreatic enzymes or tumor markers.\nLaparoscopic examination showed a large cystic tumor (12 x 11 x 5.5 cm) in the pancreas involving the body and the tail. It extended to the spleen and was highly vascularized, precluding a minimal invasive resection. An open body-tail pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. The resection margins were free of tumor, and the histological study showed a mucinous pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma with mucin-producing columnar epithelium and associated papillae patterns, reminiscent of ovarian stroma.

Eighty-six solid thyroid tumors (46 malignant and 40 benign) in 56 consecutive patients (mean age +/- SD, 53.1 +/- 11.6 years; 12 male and 44 female) referred for the surgical treatment were included in our study. Visual and qualitative analysis of patterns of nodule vascularity was performed for all tumors. Quantification of the power Doppler sonograms was performed with normalized and weighted vascular indices (VIs). The accuracy of sonographic criteria for thyroid cancer was evaluated with univariate analysis. Results. Among benign thyroid tumors, there was a statistically significant increase in the levels of intranodular vascularization with an increase in tumor size (P < .001). In all tumors, increased intranodular vascularization showed 65.2% sensitivity, 52.5% specificity, and 58.9% overall accuracy in differentiation between benign and malignant thyroid lesions. In tumors smaller than 2 cm, it had 65.5% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, and 72.1% overall accuracy.

To analyze the signals within hAT regulating their phenotypes, the influence of hAT-derived capillary endothelial cells (CECs) was studied on the chemotaxis and differentiation of the hAT-CD34+/CD31- cells. Conditioned medium from hAT-CECs led to a strong chemotaxis of the hAT-CD34+/CD31- cells that was inhibited with pretreatments with pertussis toxin, CXCR-4 antagonist, or neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, hAT-CECs produced and secreted the CXCR-4 ligand, that is, the stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Finally, hAT-CECs induced the differentiation of hAT-CD34+/CD31- cells toward an endothelial cell (EC) phenotype. Indeed, hAT-CECs and -CD34+/CD31- cell coculture stimulated in a two-dimensional system the expression of the EC CD31 marker by the hAT-progenitor cells and, in a three-dimensional approach, the formation of capillary-like structures via a SDF-1/CXCR-4 dependent pathway. Thus, the migration and differentiation of hAT progenitor cells are modulated by hAT-CEC-derived factors. SDF-1, which is secreted by hAT-derived CECs, and its receptor CXCR-4, expressed by hAT-derived progenitor cells, may promote chemotaxis and differentiation of hAT-derived progenitor cells and thus contribute to the formation of the vascular network during the development of hAT.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2007-05-26", "authors": ["CoralieSengen\u00e8s", "AlexandraMiranville", "MarieMaumus", "Sandrade Barros", "RudiBusse", "AnneBouloumi\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1634/stemcells.2007-0180"}

Free flaps are used but require longer operating time and experience with microsurgery, may result in donor-site morbidity, and sometimes add bulky tissue to the area. The authors present their experience with a sural musculoneurocutaneous flap for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the distal tibia.\nOver a 2-year period, nine distally based sural musculoneurocutaneous flaps were used in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the distal tibia. Four patients had comorbid conditions (smoking, diabetes mellitus, venous insufficiency, or obesity). The clinical aspect was represented by drainage sinuses located in the distal part of the tibia. Five patients had postsurgical scars on the lateral malleolar region and one had medial and lateral malleolar scarring. Three patients had an Ilizarov device at the time of wound coverage.\nAll wounds were closed successfully. Dehiscence surrounding the flap was encountered in a single case that was attributable to inadequate bone debridement; this flap was raised to allow extending the debridement, and a local medial fasciocutaneous flap completed wound coverage.

{"title": "Immunosuppressive effect of tryptophan metabolites in composite tissue allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Hand transplantations have intensified immunological research into composite tissue allotransplantation to induce tolerance. Pregnancy is a successful, natural model of immunological tolerance. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-deoxygenase plays an important role by catabolizing the amino acid tryptophan. The resulting metabolites have been shown to be immunosuppressive. The effect of tryptophan metabolites has not been investigated in vascularized organ transplantation before. In this study, the authors applied to composite tissue allotransplantation what nature has developed for pregnancy, and examined the immunosuppressive effect of tryptophan metabolites in a model of hind limb transplantation.\nThirty-three allogeneic hind limb transplantations in the rat (Lewis --> Brown-Norway) were performed in three groups. Group A (n = 12) received no immunosuppression, group B (n = 13) received tryptophan metabolites (kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid) locally and systemically, and group C (n = 8) served as a control group receiving FK506. The timing of rejection was assessed by clinical observation.\nRejection of the allogeneic hind limb occurred on average 6.58 days after transplantation in group A (no immunosuppression) and after 8.15 days in group B (tryptophan metabolites). Rejection was significantly delayed (log-rank test, p < 0.01). No rejection was seen with application of FK506 during the follow-up period of 21 days.\nFor the first time, tryptophan metabolites have been applied in vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation and showed a significant immunosuppressive effect. These promising first results need further dose-effect and toxicological studies to increase the still limited immunosuppressive effect and define the clinical role these metabolites may play in the future.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2007-05-24", "authors": ["Christian ARadu", "NikolausBosch", "Thomas MBauer", "ChristianKleist", "LucianJiga", "PeterTerness", "GerhardOpelz", "Martha MGebhard", "GuenterGermann", "SteffenBaumeister"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000260587.18762.a3"}

Identify the types and possible indications of the temple group flaps to be selected depending on the defects, and then raise the flap safely for reconstruction. 3. Predict and manage successfully the potential complications of surgery.\nGood harmony of color and texture with surrounding tissues, thinness and adequate pliability, good alignment, obliteration of the cavities, and minimal donor-site morbidity are the main features of an ideal flap to be used in the reconstruction of craniofacial defects. Despite the numerous local, regional, and free flaps that have been described, to date, there has not yet been an ideal flap. The authors discuss the reconstruction alternatives presented by the temporal site and its outcomes.\nThe temporal group flaps can be raised using one or more tissues based on the superficial temporal artery and its branches, depending on the defect site and nature. They can be designed as axial skin flaps consisting of transposition or V-Y island flaps, composite flaps including more than one tissue, and chimeric flaps involving both the temple skin and temporal fascia based on the two distal branches of the superficial temporal artery.\nThe temporal region is a good donor site for closure of craniofacial defects, by means of its rich vascular network and almost all types of tissue, including skin, fascia, muscle, galea, calvarial bone, and periosteum.

{"title": "Shell bone histology indicates terrestrial palaeoecology of basal turtles.", "abstract": "The palaeoecology of basal turtles from the Late Triassic was classically viewed as being semi-aquatic, similar to the lifestyle of modern snapping turtles. Lately, this view was questioned based on limb bone proportions, and a terrestrial palaeoecology was suggested for the turtle stem. Here, we present independent shell bone microstructural evidence for a terrestrial habitat of the oldest and basal most well-known turtles, i.e. the Upper Triassic Proterochersis robusta and Proganochelys quenstedti. Comparison of their shell bone histology with that of extant turtles preferring either aquatic habitats or terrestrial habitats clearly reveals congruence with terrestrial turtle taxa. Similarities in the shell bones of these turtles are a diploe structure with well-developed external and internal cortices, weak vascularization of the compact bone layers and a dense nature of the interior cancellous bone with overall short trabeculae. On the other hand, 'aquatic' turtles tend to reduce cortical bone layers, while increasing overall vascularization of the bone tissue. In contrast to the study of limb bone proportions, the present study is independent from the uncommon preservation of appendicular skeletal elements in fossil turtles, enabling the palaeoecological study of a much broader range of incompletely known turtle taxa in the fossil record.", "journal": "Proceedings.

We sought to evaluate whether prevascularization of porous hard matrices using an arteriovenous (AV) loop promotes survival of transplanted osteoblasts. A processed bovine cancellous bone matrix was inserted into the AV loop. Six weeks later, 5 x 10(6) carboxyfluorescein diacetate-stained osteoblasts were injected into the matrix (group A, n = 34). Osteoblast-seeded matrices without prevascularization were implanted subcutaneously as controls (group B, n = 32). Specimens were subjected to histologic, morphometric, and molecular-biological analysis after 1, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Upon cell injection, matrices were completely vascularized. An intense foreign body reaction was observed in matrices from both groups. Group A was significantly superior to group B in terms of osteoblast survival at any time point. Expression of bone-specific genes was detected in the AV loop group but not in the subcutaneous control. Bone formation was only detectable in 1 long-term animal of group A. This study demonstrates for the first time that axial prevascularization increases the survival of implanted osteoblasts in porous matrices.

Here, we investigated the effect of substrate mechanical properties on the formation of capillary-like networks by ECs; in particular, we examined the three-dimensional (3D) configurations of the resulting networks. Bovine pulmonary microvascular ECs (BPMECs) were cultured on a series of collagen gels of different stiffness but the same collagen concentration. Imaging techniques revealed that cells cultured in rigid and flexible gels formed 3D networks via different processes; cells formed dense, thin networks in the flexible gel, whereas thicker and deeper networks were formed in the rigid gel. Cross-sections of the networks revealed that those formed within the rigid gel had large lumens composed of multiple cells, whereas those formed within the flexible gel had small, intracellular vacuoles. The expression of vinculin, a focal adhesion protein, appeared to change with the mechanical properties of collagen gel.

{"title": "Recent advances in gene delivery for structural bone allografts.", "abstract": "In this paper, we review the progress toward developing strategies to engineer improved structural grafting of bone. Three strategies are typically used to augment massive bone defect repair. The first is to engraft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) onto a graft or a biosynthetic matrix to provide a viable osteoinductive scaffold material for segmental defect repair. The second strategy is to introduce critical factor(s), for example, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), in the form of bone-derived or recombinant proteins onto the graft or matrix directly. The third strategy uses targeted delivery of therapeutic genes (using viral and nonviral vectors) that either transduce host cells in vivo or stably transduce cells in vitro for subsequent implantation in vivo. We developed a murine femoral model in which allografts can be revitalized via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene transfer. Specifically, allografts coated with rAAV expressing either the constitutively active BMP type I receptor Alk2 (caAlk2), or the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combined with the osteoclastogenic factor receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) have remarkable osteogenic, angiogenic, and remodeling effects that have not been previously documented in healing allografts. Using histomorphometric and micro computed tomography (muCT) imaging we show that rAAV-mediated delivery of caAlk2 induces significant osteoinduction manifested by a mineralized callus on the surface of the allograft, which resembles the healing response of an autograft. We also demonstrate that the rAAV-mediated gene transfer of the combination of VEGF and RANKL can induce significant vascularization and remodeling of processed structural allografts. By contrast, rAAV-LacZ coated allograft controls appeared similar to necrotic allografts and lacked significant mineralized callus, neovascularization, and remodeling. Therefore, innovations in gene delivery offer promising therapeutic approaches for tissue engineering of structural bone substitutes that can potentially have clinical applications in challenging indications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2007-05-24", "authors": ["Hani AAwad", "XinpingZhang", "David GReynolds", "Robert EGuldberg", "Regis JO'Keefe", "Edward MSchwarz"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.0107"}

We tested the hypotheses that co-implantation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells could stimulate the vascularization of implants. To assess the presence of functional peri-implant microvasculature, we developed a novel model of implanted device containing an oxygen (O(2))-sensing spin probe (detectable using electron paramagnetic resonance) placed inside a nanoporous filter-limited capsule. These devices were implanted subcutaneously in C57/Bl6 mice alone, with the addition of a Matrigel plug in front of the filter, or with the addition of Matrigel containing equal proportions of c-kit(+) and stem cell antigen-1(+) bone marrow-derived cells. Implants partial pressure of O(2) (pO(2)) were recorded non-invasively and periodically for up to 10 weeks. Tissue surrounding the implants was collected for immunohistochemistry. Initially, there were no differences in pO(2) between the experimental groups. After 3 weeks, the devices supplied with progenitor cells showed more than twice the O(2) concentrations as controls. This difference remained significant for 4 more weeks and then started to decrease slightly, still being 6 mmHg higher than in the controls at 10 weeks post-implantation. Collagen deposition was detected around the control implants, along with F4/80-positive macrophages and giant cells. In the plugs collected from the cell treatment group, we found an active process of adipogenesis, accompanied by neovascularization, and a highly vascularized adipose layer surrounding the implants.

Further, implantation of the cell-free extracellular matrix from the immortalized chondrocytic cells causes vascularized bone to form in vivo in bony defects, but not in ectopic sites such as skeletal muscle.

Although chitosan-alginate PEC fibrous scaffold was found to be thrombogenic, the blood compatibility of the scaffold could be significantly improved by incorporating a small amount of heparin in the polyelectrolyte solution during fiber formation. The platelet microparticle production and platelet adhesion on the chitosan-alginate-heparin fibrous scaffold were comparable to those on the resting control.

It is hypothesized that cetacean (whale) integument will show unique anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment, particularly regarding differences in temperature, density, and pressure. In this study, the gross and histological structure of the southern right whale integument is described and compared with terrestrial mammals and previous descriptions of mysticete (baleen whale) and odontocete (toothed whale) species. Samples were taken of the integument of 98 free-swimming southern right whales, Eubalaena australis, and examined by both light and electron microscopy. Results show that three epidermal layers are present, with the stratum corneum being parakeratotic in nature. As in bowhead whales, southern right whales possess an acanthotic epidermis and a notably thick hypodermis, with epidermal rods and extensive papillomatosis. However, unlike bowhead whales, southern right whales possess an uninterrupted hypodermal layer. Surprisingly, the integument of balaenids (right and bowhead mysticetes) in general is more like that of odontocetes than that of the more closely related balaenopterids (rorqual mysticetes). Similarities to odontocetes were found specifically in the collagen fibers in a fat-free zone of the reticular dermal layer and the elastic fibers in the dermal and hypodermal layers. Callosities, a distinctive feature of this genus, have a slightly thicker stratum corneum and are usually associated with hairs that have innervated and vascularized follicles. These hairs may function as vibrissae, thus aiding in aquatic foraging by allowing rapid detection of changes in prey density. Although the thick insulatory integument makes right whales bulky and slow-moving, it is an adaptation for living in cold water. Epidermal thickness, presence of epidermal rods, and callosities may act as barriers against mechanical injury from bodily contact with conspecifics or hard surfaces in the environment (e.g., rocks, ice).", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2007-05-23", "authors": ["DesrayReeb", "Peter BarringtonBest", "Susan HillaryKidson"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.20535"}

To examine the action of Wnts in skeleton formation, we developed a genetic system to conditionally express Wnt4 in chondrogenic tissues of the mouse. A mouse Wnt4 cDNA was introduced into the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 (R26) locus by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The expression of Wnt4 from the R26 locus was blocked by a neomycin selection cassette flanked by loxP sites (floxneo) that was positioned between the Rosa26 promoter and the Wnt4 cDNA, creating the allele designated R26(floxneoWnt4). Wnt4 expression was activated during chondrogenesis using Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in differentiating chondrocytes. R26(floxneoWnt4); Col2a1-Cre double heterozygous mice exhibited a growth deficiency, beginning approximately 7 to 10 days after birth, that resulted in dwarfism. In addition, they also had craniofacial abnormalities, and delayed ossification of the lumbar vertebrae and pelvic bones. Histological analysis revealed a disruption in the organization of the growth plates and a delay in the onset of the primary and secondary ossification centers. Molecular studies showed that Wnt4 overexpression caused decreased proliferation and altered maturation of chondrocytes. In addition, R26(floxneoWnt4); Col2a1-Cre mice had decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These studies demonstrate that Wnt4 overexpression leads to dwarfism in mice.

The clearance modulus and the Thiele modulus are ratios of the plasma clearance rate and antibody catabolism, respectively, to the tumor tissue penetration rate.\nEven low rates of antigen internalization from constitutive membrane turnover can significantly retard antibody penetration. Rapid clearance of single-chain variable fragments also hinders uptake, often more than counterbalancing their more rapid extravasation and diffusion.\nThe model illustrates that with the large resistance from the tumor capillary, antibodies may be more suitable for targeting micrometastases than vascularized tumors.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2007-05-17", "authors": ["Greg MThurber", "Stefan CZajic", "K DaneWittrup"], "doi": "10.2967/jnumed.106.037069"}

Terminally di-acrylated Pluronic F127 and vinyl group conjugated heparin were used as a mixed macromer precursor solution to prepare a photo-crosslinkable hydrogel. An aqueous solution containing the two macromers with different weight ratios was photo-crosslinked in the presence of bFGF to produce in situ formed bFGF loaded Pluronic/heparin hydrogels. Swelling, mass erosion, bFGF release characteristics of Pluronic/heparin hydrogels were thoroughly examined by varying the weight ratio of the two macromers. The incorporation of heparin in the composite hydrogel enabled the controlled release of bFGF over a one month period in a near zero order manner. The prolonged release of bFGF could be attributed to the specific interaction between bFGF and heparin in the hydrogel matrices. The released bFGF fraction from the degradable hydrogels also showed sufficient proliferation activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC).

{"title": "Extensor retinaculum syndrome after distal tibial fractures: anatomical basis.", "abstract": "Fractures of the distal extremity of the tibia include physeal injuries among teenagers and more complex fractures among adults. Displacement causes the compression of the muscles located between the distal tibia and the superior extensor retinaculum (SER). Among the muscles of anterior compartment of the leg, the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) is particularly vulnerable due to the amount of muscle fibers extending under the SER. Consequently, a partial anterior compartment syndrome could result, affecting only the distal portion located under the SER. In clinical practice, Mubarak measured the intramuscular pressure isolated under the SER and suggested the physio-pathological hypothesis of a compression of distal muscle fibers. The aim of this study is to compare the ratios of anterior compartment muscle fibers extending under the SER. Twenty legs were dissected in order to study how much of these muscles extend under the SER, their passages possibly dividing into two of the SER, as well as their vascularization and their innervation. On the last seven legs, the engagement of the muscles were measured in the spontaneous position and with a dorsal flexion of 0 degrees . The posterior muscle fibers of this compartment always descend lower than the anterior fibers. EHL muscle fibers and those of the inconsistent fibularis tertius always extend under the retinaculum, unlike those of the tibialis anterior and of the extensor digitorum longus. The EHL muscle extends under the SER more than the other muscles. Its posterior fibers are longer when this muscle goes through a dividing into two of the retinaculum. Its vascularization seems lesser, which could explain why this muscle tends to suffer more. The deep fibular nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the leg, yet no nerve branches can be found under the upper edge of the retinaculum. In all cases, the muscle fibers do not extend as much under the SER in a 0 degrees of dorsal flexion. This anatomical study allows us to explain why the EHL is more likely to suffer from this partial compartment syndrome and confirms that when the latter occurs it is necessary, in all cases, to do emergency surgery opening the distal crural fascia and necessarily including the SER.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2007-05-16", "authors": ["THaumont", "G CGauchard", "LZabee", "J-MArnoux", "PJourneau", "PLascombes"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-007-0215-3"}
{"title": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via an mTOR signaling motif.", "abstract": "Tumors that form as a result of heightened mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are highly vascularized. This process of angiogenesis is regulated through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated transcription of angiogenic factors. It is recognized that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin can diminish the process of angiogenesis. Our work shows that activation of mTOR by Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) overexpression potently enhances the activity of HIF1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A secretion during hypoxia, which is reversed with rapamycin. Mutants of Rheb, which do not bind guanine nucleotide (D60K, D60V, N119I, and D122N) and are unable to activate mTOR, inhibit the activity of HIF when overexpressed. We show that regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) interacts with HIF1alpha and requires an mTOR signaling (TOS) motif located in the N terminus of HIF1alpha. Furthermore, a mutant of HIF1alpha lacking this TOS motif dominantly impaired HIF activity during hypoxia and was unable to bind to the co-activator CBP/p300. Rapamycin treatments do not affect the stability of HIF1alpha and modulate HIF activity via a Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that the high levels of HIF activity in cells devoid of TSC2 can be reversed by treatments with rapamycin or the readdition of TSC2. Our work explains why human cancers with aberrant mTOR signaling are prone to angiogenesis and suggests that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin might be a suitable therapeutic strategy.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2007-05-16", "authors": ["Stephen CLand", "Andrew RTee"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M611782200"}

Tissue sections were analyzed with histologic and immunohistochemical staining to evaluate cellular infiltration and vascularization.\nNo herniation or dehiscence occurred with either material. The incidence and strength of adhesions was similar between materials. The mean breaking strength of the AlloDerm-fascia interface (14.5 +/- 8.9 N) was greater than the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-fascia interface (8.7 +/- 4.4 N; p = 0.027) and similar to the rib-intercostal-rib interface of the contralateral native chest wall (14.0 +/- 5.6 N).

Tissue inside the chambers was analyzed for shape conformation to chamber geometry, gross tissue volume, and bone histomorphology.\nThere were no differences in volume or shape of tissue formed in the chambers. However, chambers in contact with fascia consisted almost entirely of fibrovascular tissue, with progressive resorption of the morcellized bone graft and little evidence of new bone. Chambers in contact with periosteum showed active endochondral, direct, and appositional bone formation over time, with increasing calcified tissue area and new bone formation.\nBoth periosteum and muscle fascia were able to vascularize bone grafts, but bone formation was higher in the periosteum.

Using adult rats with vascularized bone transplantation, we show that long-term cyclosporine A administration increases bone turnover and zoledronic acid treatment enhances the reconstruction of cyclosporine A-administered skeleton. Bisphosphonates might be efficacious in human bone repair under immunosuppression using cyclosporine A.\nBisphosphonate treatment effectively prevents bone loss after transplantation.

The aim of this study was to follow the process of adhesion formation in several prosthetic materials by sequential laparoscopy.\nDefects (7 x 5 cm) were created in the abdominal wall of 30 New Zealand White rabbits and repaired using Surgipro polypropylene mesh (PP), Ultrapro monocryl-prolene mesh (UP), Dual Mesh expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Composix (PP-ePTFE), Parietex Composite (polyester with collagen-polyethylene glycol-glycerol coating [PO-gl]), or PL-PU99 (PP-polyurethane) patches fixed to the edges of the defect by running polypropylene suture. Adhesions to the implants were laparoscopically determined at 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery.\nPercentage adhesion scores were significantly lower for ePTFE, PP-ePTFE, PO-gl, and PP-PU, compared to PP or UP. No differences were observed in adhesion scores recorded at 3, 7, and 14 days postimplant. Reticular prostheses were infiltrated by disorganized scar tissue with fibers concentric to the mesh filaments. In contrast, ePTFE implants were encapsulated by organized tissue, with fibers running parallel to the surface of biomaterial. All three composites achieved good recipient tissue integration and a homogeneous, organized, and well-vascularized neoperitoneum.\nAt 14 days postimplant, laminar prostheses and composites showed similar results in terms of adhesion formation and integration within host tissue. Our findings suggest that both the composite prostheses and the laminar ePTFE performed very well in terms of reduced adhesion formation at the peritoneal interface.", "journal": "Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Before fenestration, bare stents were inserted in both renal arteries as fluoroscopic landmarks. A 12-mm iliac extension served as the canine aortic endograft. The first procedure was done under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, using an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) probe inserted in the vena cava and a Pioneer IVUS catheter. The second was performed exclusively under fluoroscopic guidance with a Brockenbrough needle. Angiograms and duplex ultrasound were planned for 1 month, after which the dogs would be sacrificed for autopsy. The explanted endograft was subjected to biomaterials analysis, with a focus on fabric tear.\nPerforation of the aortic graft and catheterization of the renal arteries with a floppy guidewire were possible in both animals. In dog 1, aortic graft dilation and subsequent fenestration were not possible, and the experiment was terminated. However, the procedure was successful in both renal arteries of dog 2. At 1-month follow-up in this dog, both renal arteries were patent. Stent fractures were observed bilaterally. There was no extension of the damage to the fabric beyond the area of fenestration.\nIn vivo antegrade fenestration of aortic endografts is technically feasible.

{"title": "Clinicopathologic significance of tumor cell-lined vessel and microenvironment in oral squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be vascularized through a process called \"tumor cell-lined vessels\". Currently, the tumor microenvironment, which is recognized as hypoxic and orchestrated largely by inflammatory cells and defective blood vessels, is considered an important participant in the neoplastic process. We sought to determine their clinicopathologic significance and prognostic implication in oral SCC. Vascular structure was investigated by multistaining with pan-cytokeratin, CD34, and alpha-smooth actin/type IV collagen. Immunohistochemical staining of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and CD68 was used to reflect hypoxia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Our results showed that in a high percentage of vessels in cancer tissue. There is absence of pericyte coverage and loss of basement membrane lining. Significant association between the integrity of vascular structure and lymph node involvement and presence of tumor cell-lined vessel was found. HIF-1 alpha overexpression was frequently observed in cancer cells (78/112) and correlated with tumor progress index. In cancer tissues, the TAM ranged from 28 to 296 cells/mm2 with a mean of 144.6+/-64.3 cells/mm2. There was a significant correlation between TAM and lymph node involvement (P=0.004) and tumor size (P=0.004). Also, a close association was found between TAM count and integrity of vascular structure. In addition, survival analysis revealed that tumor cell-lined vessels (P=0.001), HIF-1 alpha expression (P=0.004), and TAM (P=0.001) correlated significantly with poor survival. We conclude that in the cancer microenvironment, HIF-1 alpha expression and the TAM are induced and contributed to malignant behavior of tumor cells.

{"title": "Computer simulation of glioma growth and morphology.", "abstract": "Despite major advances in the study of glioma, the quantitative links between intra-tumor molecular/cellular properties, clinically observable properties such as morphology, and critical tumor behaviors such as growth and invasiveness remain unclear, hampering more effective coupling of tumor physical characteristics with implications for prognosis and therapy. Although molecular biology, histopathology, and radiological imaging are employed in this endeavor, studies are severely challenged by the multitude of different physical scales involved in tumor growth, i.e., from molecular nanoscale to cell microscale and finally to tissue centimeter scale. Consequently, it is often difficult to determine the underlying dynamics across dimensions. New techniques are needed to tackle these issues. Here, we address this multi-scalar problem by employing a novel predictive three-dimensional mathematical and computational model based on first-principle equations (conservation laws of physics) that describe mathematically the diffusion of cell substrates and other processes determining tumor mass growth and invasion. The model uses conserved variables to represent known determinants of glioma behavior, e.g., cell density and oxygen concentration, as well as biological functional relationships and parameters linking phenomena at different scales whose specific forms and values are hypothesized and calculated based on in vitro and in vivo experiments and from histopathology of tissue specimens from human gliomas. This model enables correlation of glioma morphology to tumor growth by quantifying interdependence of tumor mass on the microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia, tissue disruption) and on the cellular phenotypes (e.g., mitosis and apoptosis rates, cell adhesion strength). Once functional relationships between variables and associated parameter values have been informed, e.g., from histopathology or intra-operative analysis, this model can be used for disease diagnosis/prognosis, hypothesis testing, and to guide surgery and therapy. In particular, this tool identifies and quantifies the effects of vascularization and other cell-scale glioma morphological characteristics as predictors of tumor-scale growth and invasion.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2007-05-04", "authors": ["Hermann BFrieboes", "John SLowengrub", "SWise", "XZheng", "PaulMacklin", "Elaine LBearer", "VittorioCristini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.008"}

With a detailed anatomy of the human eye and orbit inserted in a whole-head model, the specific absorption rates (SARs) and thermal effects were determined under exposure to a dipole antenna representing a mobile phone operating at 900, 1500 and 1800 MHz with an output power of 1 W. The temperature rise was calculated by taking the blood flow into account either by the Pennes bioheat model or by including the discrete vasculature (DIVA). In addition, a simple spherical model using constant heat transfer coefficients was used. Peak SARs in the humour are 4.5, 7.7 and 8.4 W kg(-1) for 900, 1500 and 1800 MHz respectively. Averaged over the whole eyeball, the SARs are 1.7, 2.5 and 2.2 W kg(-1). The maximum temperature rises in the eye due to the exposure are 0.22, 0.27 and 0.25 degrees C for exposure of 900, 1500 and 1800 MHz, respectively, calculated with DIVA. For the Pennes bioheat model, the temperature rises are slightly lower: 0.19, 0.24, 0.22 degrees C respectively. For the simple spherical model, the maximum temperature rises are 0.15, 0.22 and 0.20 degrees C. The peak temperature is located in the anterior part of the lens for 900 MHz and deeper in the eye for higher frequencies, and in the posterior part of the lens for 1500 MHz and close to the centre of the eyeball for 1800 MHz. For these RF safety applications, both DIVA and the Pennes bioheat model could be used to relate the SAR distributions to the resulting temperature distributions. Even though, for these artificial exposure conditions, the SAR values are not in compliance with safety guidelines, the maximum temperature rises in the eye are too small to give harmful effects.

{"title": "A fresh look at vascularized flexor tendon transfers: concept, technical aspects and results.", "abstract": "The authors present the results of their surgical experience based on an original approach in secondary reconstructing 71 flexor tendons of the hand. For 20 years, they have been using vascularized tendon transfers either islanded or as free transfers. Their techniques are based on extensive knowledge of the sliding mechanisms involved around the flexor tendons, for which the authors have developed new scientific explanations resulting from their observations and the fine analysis of movements. This sliding system has a multimicrovacuolar, multifibrillar architecture that is able to accommodate every request for movement. By performing vascularized transfers, the authors also transfer the sliding capability together with the tendon itself, thereby avoiding the two traditional stages of tendon reconstruction. Results are better than with the traditional techniques and the gain in time is considerable. Moreover, the biological and physical advantages of transferring living structures are such that the functional outcome in secondary interventions is much better. Furthermore, the wide variety of transfers available offers possibilities for reconstruction that are better suited to the range of presentations encountered in this challenging area of surgery. This new approach to reconstruction is reserved for complex clinical cases and experienced surgeons.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2007-05-01", "authors": ["J CGuimberteau", "JBakhach", "BPanconi", "SRouzaud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2007.02.021"}

The initial strength, stiffness, and suture retention force were measured using standard mechanical test methods. The relative pore sizes of each device were assessed with a scanning electron microscope. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure their respective collagen denaturation temperatures. The biologic response and performance of the materials were evaluated via an acute (1 month) and long-term (3 and 6 months) canine bilateral duraplasty study.\nThe mechanical properties of Dura-Guard and Durepair were similar to native dura. We could not quantify the mechanical properties of DuraGen because of its fragile nature. The denaturation temperature of DuraGen and Dura-Guard differed significantly from that reported for native collagens. The denaturation temperature of Durepair was comparable with the values reported for native collagens. All three materials were tolerated well by the animals. DuraGen did not maintain its structural integrity beyond 1 month. Dura-Guard and Durepair persisted for 6 months. Durepair was populated by fibroblasts and blood vessels, whereas Dura-Guard was not.\nThe three dural substitutes tested were found to be safe and effective in healing surgically created defects in the dura mater. Although each of these dura substitutes are composed of collagen, differences in the collagen source and processing influenced device physicomechanical properties, porosity, and the nativity of the collagen polymer.

We therefore designed a surgical model for cervical heterotopic pancreas transplantation using a cuff technique.\nC57BL6 mice were used as donor and recipient pairs. Recipients were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and subsequently transplanted. The donor pancreas was isolated using a no-touch technique and then placed in the recipient's cervical region. Vascular anastomoses were completed by pulling the portal vein over the external jugular vein cuff and the donor aortic segment over the carotid cuff and fixed with an 8-0 ligature thereby facilitating a nonsuture technique. To test applicability of this model, graft microcirculation was evaluated by intravital microscopy after prolonged cold ischemia (16 h).\nThe immediate success rate was >90%. Donor operation lasted 40 +/- 5 min; dissection of recipient vessels lasted 20 +/- 4 min. Revascularization time was 4 to 6 min, resulting in a total pancreas ischemia time of 33 +/- 6 min. No thromboembolic complications on the cuff side were observed. Preoperative glucose levels were 518 +/- 59 mg/dl and returned to normal by postoperative day 1 (88 +/- 13 mg/dl). Histology on postoperative days 10 and 30 showed almost normal islet cell and acinar architecture of all grafts. In groups with prolonged cold ischemia, graft microcirculation was significantly reduced and paralleled by increased inflammation, interstitial edema, hemorrhage, acinar vacuolization, and focal areas of necrosis compared with nonischemic controls.\nThis new model may provide an excellent tool to further investigate the pathophysiology as well as novel therapeutic strategies of preservation, ischemia reperfusion injury, and graft pancreatitis.", "journal": "Surgery", "date": "2007-04-28", "authors": ["ManuelMaglione", "MartinHermann", "PaulHengster", "StefanSchneeberger", "WalterMark", "PeterObrist", "RaimundMargreiter", "GeraldBrandacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.surg.2006.07.037"}

In melanoma, it has been previously shown that variable levels of MCP-1/CCL2 appear to correlate with infiltrating macrophages and tumor fate, with low to intermediate levels of the chemokine contributing to melanoma development. To work under such conditions, a poorly tumorigenic human melanoma cell line was transfected with an expression vector encoding MCP-1. We found that M2 macrophages are associated to MCP-1+ tumors, triggering a profuse vascular network. To target the protumoral macrophages recruitment and reverting tumor growth promotion, clodronate-laden liposomes (Clod-Lip) or bindarit were administered to melanoma-bearing mice. Macrophage depletion after Clod-Lip treatment induced development of smaller tumors than in untreated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-CD31 antibody revealed scarce vascular structures mainly characterized by narrow vascular lights. Pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 with bindarit also reduced tumor growth and macrophage recruitment, rendering necrotic tumor masses.

Number of circulating EPCs was analyzed in 104 consecutive patients with proven or clinically suspected CAD. Adhesive and migratory activity was also determined. The number of EPCs was lower in patients with a single diseased coronary artery (Group II, n=35, p<0.05 vs. Group I) or multiple diseased arteries (Group III, n=25, p<0.01 vs. Group I, p<0.05 vs. Group II) compared to those with normal coronary arteries (Group I, n=44). The number of EPCs was also related with angiographic Gensini score (r=-0.355, p=0.006). In addition, concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated in patients with CAD, and positively correlated with Gensini score (r=0.476, p=0.001). As for the risk factors, the number of EPCs was also inversely correlated with age (p=0.001), high sensitivity-CRP (p=0.012), hypertension (p=0.042) and family history of CAD (p=0.043). Most importantly, the migratory capacity of EPCs was compromised in patients with CAD, and inversely correlated with the angiographic Gensini score (r=-0.315, p=0.021).

In conclusion, in patients with stable CAD, reduction in the number and impairment in the function of circulating EPCs were correlated with the severity of coronary stenosis.

The DLX4 homeobox gene maps to the 17q21.3-q22 region that is amplified in some epithelial ovarian cancers. Because amplification of this region correlates with poor prognosis, we investigated whether DLX4 overexpression contributes to aggressive behavior of this disease. DLX4 was not detected in normal ovary and cystadenomas, whereas its expression in ovarian carcinomas was strongly associated with high tumor grade and advanced disease stage. Overexpression of DLX4 in ovarian cancer cells promoted growth in low serum and colony formation. Imaging of mice bearing intraperitoneal tumors revealed that DLX4 overexpression substantially increased tumor burden. Tumors that overexpressed DLX4 were more vascularized than vector-control tumors. Conditioned medium of DLX4-overexpressing tumor cells was more effective than medium conditioned by vector-control cells in stimulating endothelial cell growth. These observations were associated with the ability of DLX4 to induce expression of vascular endothelial growth factor as well as intracellular and secreted isoforms of fibroblast growth factor-2.

The parameters of P-CDU (Penile Color Duplex Ultrasound), NPT (Nocturnal Penile Tumescence), and IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) were compared between the two groups 6 months after operation. Group I was higher than group II in IIEF (21 vs 14) with significant differences. With P-CDU we observed an improvement in penile vascularization in group I as confirmed by the detection of an increase in peak systolic velocity (PSV) (26 cm/s vs 16 cm/s, p<0.01) and a decrease in end diastolic velocity (EDV) (3 cm/s vs 6 cm/s p<0.05), resulting in an increase in resistive index (RI) (0.85 vs 0.56, p<0.05).

This case report describes a new method for closure of these fistulas where prior conservative and surgical treatment had failed. Initial use of a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system optimized wound care and led to coverage of the exposed intestines with granulation tissue. The serratus muscle of a composite free latissimus dorsi-serratus flap was used to close the fistula, while the large abdominal wall defect was closed with the musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap. Temporary placement of a VAC system between the serratus muscle and the latissimus dorsi muscle immobilized the serratus to the fistula and counteracted changes in abdominal pressure. The layering of muscle, VAC system, and muscle resembles a sandwich.

CECs and CPCs are currently studied as surrogate markers in patients for more than a dozen pathologies, including heart disease and cancer. However, data interpretation has often been difficult because of multiple definitions, methods and protocols used to evaluate and count these cells by different laboratories. Here, we propose a cytometry protocol for phenotypic identification and enumeration of CECs and CPCs in human blood using four surface markers: CD31, CD34, CD133 and CD45. This method allows further phenotypic analyses to explore the biology of these cells. In addition, it offers a platform for longitudinal studies of these cells in patients with different pathologies. The protocol is relatively simple, inexpensive and can be adapted for multiple flow cytometer types or software.

{"title": "Thoracic aortas from multiorgan donors are suitable for obtaining resident angiogenic mesenchymal stromal cells.", "abstract": "The clinical use of endothelial progenitor cells is hampered by difficulties in obtaining an adequate number of functional progenitors. This study aimed to establish whether human thoracic aortas harvested from healthy multiorgan donors can be a valuable source of angiogenic progenitors. Immunohistochemical tissue studies showed that two distinct cell populations with putative stem cell capabilities, one composed of CD34+ cells and the other of c-kit+ cells, are present in between the media and adventitia of human thoracic aortas. Ki-67+ cells with high growth potential were located in an area corresponding to the site of CD34+ and c-kit+ cell residence. We thus isolated cells (0.5 approximately 2.0 x 10(4) aortic progenitors per 25 cm2) which, upon culturing, coexpressed molecules of mesenchymal stromal cells (i.e., CD44+, CD90+, CD105+) and showed a transcript expression of stem cell markers (e.g., OCT4, c-kit, BCRP-1, Interleukin-6) and BMI-1. Cell expansion was adequate for use in a clinical setting. A subset of cultured cells acquired the phenotype of endothelial cells in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., increased expression of KDR and von Willebrand factor positivity), as documented by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. An in vitro angiogenesis test kit revealed that cells were able to form capillary-like structures within 6 hours of seeding. This study demonstrates that thoracic aortas from multiorgan donors yield mesenchymal stromal cells with the ability to differentiate in vitro into endothelial cells. These cells can be used for the creation of an allogenic bank of angiogenic progenitors, thus providing new options for restoring vascularization at ischemic sites.

{"title": "Three-dimensional perfusion culture of human adipose tissue-derived endothelial and osteoblastic progenitors generates osteogenic constructs with intrinsic vascularization capacity.", "abstract": "In this study, we aimed at generating osteogenic and vasculogenic constructs starting from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of human adipose tissue as a single cell source. SVF cells from human lipoaspirates were seeded and cultured for 5 days in porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds by alternate perfusion through the scaffold pores, eliminating standard monolayer (two-dimensional [2D]) culture. The resulting cell-scaffold constructs were either enzymatically treated to extract and characterize the cells or subcutaneously implanted in nude mice for 8 weeks to assess the capacity to form bone tissue and blood vessels. SVF cells were also expanded in 2D culture for 5 days and statically loaded in the scaffolds. The SVF yielded 5.9 +/- 3.5 x 10(5) cells per milliliter of lipoaspirate containing both mesenchymal progenitors (5.2% +/- 0.9% fibroblastic colony forming units) and endothelial-lineage cells (54% +/- 6% CD34+/CD31+ cells). After 5 days, the total cell number was 1.8-fold higher in 2D than in three-dimensional (3D) cultures, but the percentage of mesenchymal- and endothelial-lineage cells was similar (i.e., 65%-72% of CD90+ cells and 7%-9% of CD34+/CD31+ cells). After implantation, constructs from both conditions contained blood vessels stained for human CD31 and CD34, functionally connected to the host vasculature. Importantly, constructs generated under 3D perfusion, and not those based on 2D-expanded cells, reproducibly formed bone tissue. In conclusion, direct perfusion of human adipose-derived cells through ceramic scaffolds establishes a 3D culture system for osteoprogenitor and endothelial cells and generates osteogenic-vasculogenic constructs.

{"title": "Platelets are novel regulators of neovascularization and luteinization during human corpus luteum formation.", "abstract": "The human corpus luteum is a unique endocrine organ that is periodically constructed from the ovulated follicle. During human corpus luteum formation, which is well known as a pathophysiological model for tissue remodeling, the precise mechanisms by which centripetal vascular development is regulated remain unknown. Recently platelets were reported to contain chemoattractive substances with the potential to induce endothelial migration. In this study, we examined the involvement of platelets in the early tissue remodeling process of the human corpus luteum. An immunohistochemical study demonstrated that considerable amounts of red blood cells and CD41-positive platelets were localized at extravascular sites among luteinizing granulosa cells after ovulation. Platelet deposition gradually decreased and became limited near the central cavity toward which microvessels were extending. Platelets were hardly observed in the midluteal phase when the vascular network had already been established. These platelets expressed CD62P/P-selectin and were colocalized with extracellular matrix, suggesting that platelets had been activated by the extracellular matrix. Progesterone production by luteinizing granulosa cells that were isolated from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy was significantly promoted by direct contact with platelets during 4-d culture. Platelet-derived soluble factors induced spreading in granulosa cell morphology. These factors also increased the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas luteinizing granulosa cells attenuated platelet-induced endothelial cell migration. These findings lead us to propose the novel concept that platelets are regulators of endothelial cell migration and granulosa cell luteinization in the remodeling process of the human corpus luteum.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2007-04-21", "authors": ["KazumiFurukawa", "HiroshiFujiwara", "YukiyasuSato", "Bin-XiangZeng", "HarukoFujii", "ShinyaYoshioka", "EiichiroNishi", "TakeshiNishio"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2006-1687"}

Longitudinal and transversal cutaneous markings allowed analysis of the behaviour of the skin paddle during the course of direct closure and flap mobilisation. Injections of coloured solutions were performed before and after the flap elevation to visualise the vascularisation of the flap.\nThe superficial vascular network was always preserved by the blunt dissection of the flap's margins and perforators arising from the underlying muscular tissue were constantly found. The dual vascularisation of the flap was then confirmed. Cutaneous markings showed the skin paddle to remain static in size with advancement of the surrounding tissues to meet the flap. The flap advancement opens a long and narrow defect on the lateral margin, the approximation of which in a V-Y fashion reduces even more the surface to be closed. Elevation of the flap also allows distribution of the tension forces over a greater surface both within the flap as well as the surrounding tissues.\nThe vascular reliability of this flap and its versatile design potentially gives it a universal application all over the body.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2007-04-21", "authors": ["PhilippePelissier", "MaxSantoul", "VincentPinsolle", "VincentCasoli", "FelixBehan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2007.01.072"}

{"title": "Regional multilineage differentiation potential of meniscal fibrochondrocytes: implications for meniscus repair.", "abstract": "The knee menisci are wedge-shaped semilunar fibrocartilaginous structures that reside between the femur and tibia and function to transmit and distribute load. These structures have characteristics of both fibrous and cartilaginous tissues. The cartilage-like inner region and the fibrous vascularized outer region each has a distinct extracellular matrix, and resident meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) with distinct morphologies dependent on their location. Damage to the meniscus is common, and disruption of tissue structure and function result in erosion of the underlying articular cartilage. It has been observed that damage in the vascular periphery undergoes spontaneous repair, whereas damage of the inner region does not heal. While vascularity of the peripheral region plays a role in healing, recent findings have also suggested that local cellular composition influences local healing capacity. This study examined the variation in multipotential characteristics of cell populations isolated from different regions of the bovine meniscus. MFCs were isolated from the outer (vascular), inner (avascular), and horn (mixed) regions and induced toward chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic lineages. The results of this study suggest that MFCs from all regions of the meniscus possess a multilineage differentiation capability, particularly toward chondrogenesis and adipogenesis. MFCs from the outer region were most plastic, differentiating along all three mesenchymal lineages.

By transducing VEGF165 into a nontumorigenic rat ovarian surface epithelial cell line (ROSE199), we investigated the direct effect of an angiogenic phenotype on tumor development. The neu oncogene, which is overexpressed in >30% of ovarian cancers, was used in comparison. Neu-transfected ROSE199 cells showed phenotypic characteristics of transformation in vitro with an abundance of focus-forming units in monolayer cultures and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. In contrast, VEGF-secreting ROSE199 cells (VR) retained normal morphology and in vitro growth characteristics (e.g., proliferation rate) compared with parental ROSE199 cells. Interestingly, injection of VR cells into athymic mice formed malignant ascites in 100% of the animals when injected into the peritoneum and developed vascularized tumors in 85% of the mice when injected s.c. Furthermore, blocking VEGF-mediated signaling by the Flk-1/KDR receptor kinase inhibitor SU5416 significantly inhibited the growth of VR tumors. To validate that the proangiogenic switch is responsible for tumor development, the angiogenic phenotype was balanced by the inducible coexpression of endostatin under the control of Tet-activated promoter. Coexpression of endostatin along with VEGF reversed the tumorigenic phenotype of VR cells.

A simple theoretical analysis of the design constraints relevant to a modular construct was performed and used to define useable device operating ranges. The analysis assumed that the primary design constraint was the operating wall shear stress that would lead to a non-thrombogenic endothelial cell layer. At the lower end of the desirable shear range, oxygen depletion (over the length of the construct) limited the maximum allowed construct length, whereas at the upper end of this shear range, construct pressure difference limited maximum construct length. To compare with the theoretical analysis, real constructs were assembled, and construct porosity was assessed using superficial velocity-pressure difference profiles. Significant deviations from ideal construct porosity were observed for soft collagen gel constructs. Improvement of the module mechanical properties through the use of poloxamine instead of collagen as the module material enabled constructs closer to the ideal case to be assembled.

However, the efficiency of microencapsulated islet transplantation is low, requiring more islets to achieve normoglycemia than in vascularized islet transplantation. Exendin-4 (a glucagon-like receptor agonist) has been previously shown to improve islet transplantation outcome in rodents. We investigated whether this treatment would enhance the function of microencapsulated islets in vitro and in vivo. Encapsulated or naked islets were cultured with or without exendin-4 for 72 h. To test in vitro function, insulin release and glucose oxidation rates were measured in the absence or presence of exendin-4. In addition, in vivo function of a minimal mass of 350 microencapsulated islets was assessed by syngeneic transplantation into the peritoneal cavity of alloxan-diabetic mice. Glucose oxidation rates of microencapsulated islets were improved by 72-h pretreatment with exendin-4. Insulin release was increased both acutely after glucose stimulation and over a 40-h culture period by the presence of exendin-4.

Contraindications for use of the DIEAP flap may include previous abdominal liposuction and/or surgery, or lack of abdominal tissue. The purpose of this paper is to describe options of using abdominal perforator flaps, based on double-pedicle techniques, despite these contraindications. A retrospective evaluation was carried out on a series of 16 patients who required abdominal double-pedicle free perforator flaps for unilateral breast reconstruction since June 2002. The indications were multiple abdominal scars, previous abdominal liposuction and thin patients in five, three and eight cases, respectively. Preoperative mapping of the vascular network was done using Duplex and/or multi-detector CT scan imaging. Clinical evaluation of medical charts was done regarding patients' characteristics, surgical techniques, ischaemia/total operative time and complications. A clinical evaluation was done on all patients with average follow up of 15 months. Fat necrosis was investigated clinically and by mammogram examination. Different microsurgical techniques were performed to provide enough blood supply to the requested flaps: Perforator (P) to contralateral Deep Inferior Epigastric (DIE) anastomosis (P/DIEAP), in two patients; bilateral DIE vessels (DIEAP/DIEAP) in seven patients; and DIE with SIE (superficial inferior epigastric) vessels in seven patients (DIEAP/SIEA). One pedicle was always anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels. The second pedicle was anastomosed end-to-end to a side branch of the DIE or end-to-side with the DIE pedicle in 13 cases. The thoracodorsal vessels were used as recipient vessels for the second pedicle in three cases. Average operative time was 6h 30min (range 5h 30min-8h). All 16 flaps survived and fat necrosis occurred in one case. The harvesting of perforator free flaps may be contraindicated in some patients, however they are still a feasible option as long as the vessels to the skin are present.

{"title": "The role of oxidative stress in spontaneous abortion and recurrent pregnancy loss: a systematic review.", "abstract": "Human reproduction is not considered a highly efficient biological process. Before the end of the first trimester, 30%-50% of conceptions end in spontaneous abortion. Most losses occur at the time of implantation. 15%-20% of clinical pregnancies end in spontaneous abortions. Recurrent pregnancy loss is a frustrating clinical problem both for clinicians and patients. Recurrent pregnancy loss affects 0.5%-3% of women in the reproductive age group, and between 50%-60% of recurrent pregnancy losses are idiopathic. Oxidative stress-induced damage has been hypothesized to play a role in spontaneous abortion, idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss, hydatidiform mole, defective embryogenesis, and drug-induced teratogenicity. Some studies implicate systemic and placental oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of abortion and recurrent pregnancy loss. Oxidant-induced endothelial damage, impaired placental vascularization and immune malfunction have all been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss. Oxidative stress-induced placental dysfunction may be a common cause of the multifactorial and polygenic etiologies of abortion, recurrent pregnancy loss, defective embryogenesis, hydatidiform mole, and drug-induced teratogenic effects. Oxidative stress-induced modification of phospholipids has been linked to the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies in the antiphospholipid syndrome. The objective of this review was to examine the association between oxidative stress, spontaneous abortion and recurrent pregnancy loss, based on the published literature. We conducted an extensive literature search utilizing the databases of Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane from 1986 to 2005. The following keywords were used: oxidative stress, abortion, recurrent pregnancy loss, reactive oxygen species, antioxidants, fetal development, and embryopathies. We conducted an electronic search, as well as a manual search of cross-references. We have included all studies in the English language found in the literature focusing on oxidative stress and its association with abortions, recurrent pregnancy loss and drug-induced teratogenicity. The role of antioxidant vitamins for primary prevention of oxidative stress-induced pathologies needs to be investigated further.\nObstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians.\nAfter completion of this article, the reader should be able to state that the causes of spontaneous and recurrent abortion are multifaceted, however, some of the causes may be preventable and also explain that the role of oxidative stress during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes has a basis in pathophysiology, although the role of oxidative stress and the treatment of oxidative stress during or before pregnancy remains speculative.", "journal": "Obstetrical & gynecological survey", "date": "2007-04-12", "authors": ["SajalGupta", "AshokAgarwal", "JashomanBanerjee", "Juan GAlvarez"], "doi": "10.1097/01.ogx.0000261644.89300.df"}

These defects, especially in patients who received preoperative radiotherapy, are best reconstructed with vascularized tissue. The Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap, a pedicled nasoseptal flap, is our preferred method for reconstruction. This option is not available, however, in patients who underwent a previous posterior septectomy or in those with tumors that invade the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) or sphenoid sinus rostrum. In this scenario, we have used a temporoparietal fascial flap (TPFF) for the reconstruction of large surgical defects.\nWe developed a new technique for the transposition of the TPFF into the nasal cavity to reconstruct skull base defects after EEA. The flap is harvested using a conventional hemicoronal incision but is then advanced to the defect using a temporal-infratemporal tunnel and an endonasal transpterygoid approach. The latter is created using an endoscopic endonasal approach that involves the resection of the posterior wall of the antrum, dissection of the PPF, and partial resection of the pterygoid plates. These maneuvers open a bone window to accommodate the flap. The soft tissue tunnel, extending from the temporal to the infratemporal and then to the PPF, is opened with percutaneous tracheostomy dilators. We present a detailed description of the surgical technique and a retrospective review of two cases in which we used this technique.\nTwo patients with large CSF fistulas who had undergone preoperative radiotherapy were reconstructed transposing the TPFF through a transpterygoid tunnel. We obtained an adequate exposure for placing the flap endonasally, and the flap provided complete coverage of the skull base defect. Both CSF leaks were resolved without any additional morbidity from the flap or the access technique.\nThe TPFF is a reliable and versatile method for the reconstruction of the anterior, middle, clival, and parasellar skull base after EEAs. Its harvesting requires an external incision; thus, it is not our preferred method of reconstruction.

In one case, an additional skin graft was performed because of partial omental necrosis that occurred within 2 weeks. Fibular synostosis developed in eight cases, but amputation was performed in one case because of failed fibular synostosis.

Measurements of limb length were assessed in vivo using conventional radiography and confirmed on harvesting. Mice exposed to repeat treatments of 10 J x2 displayed enhanced bioluminescence 2 weeks after photodynamic therapy.

In the present study, we examined the effect of alendronate on the healing of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers in rats and investigated the mechanism involved in this action both in vivo and in vitro using the rat gastric epithelial cell line (RGM1). Acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers healed spontaneously, with up-regulation of COX-2/prostaglandin E2 production as well as expression of vascular endothelium-derived growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in ulcerated mucosa. The healing of ulcers was impaired by indomethacin (2 mg/kg, s.c.) or alendronate (60 mg/kg, p.o.) given once daily for 7 days, starting 3 days after acid application. Indomethacin, but not alendronate, inhibited mucosal prostaglandin E2 production. Alendronate as well as indomethacin decreased the protein expression of both VEGF and bFGF in ulcerated mucosa, resulting in a reduction of angiogenesis in the ulcer base. Supplementation of recombinant bFGF significantly reverted the delay in ulcer healing caused by alendronate. On the other hand, the size of cell-free areas in RGM1 cells in vitro decreased with time after wound induction, and this process was promoted by epidermal growth factor (EGF; 10 ng/ml). Co-incubation with alendronate (1 mM) did not affect the spontaneous healing but significantly suppressed the accelerated wound healing caused by EGF. These results suggest that alendronate impairs the healing of gastric ulcers in rats, and this effect may be related to down-regulation of VEGF and bFGF, the important growth factors for vascularization/granulation, as well as suppression of the stimulatory action of EGF on epithelial proliferation/migration.", "journal": "Digestive diseases and sciences", "date": "2007-04-06", "authors": ["KikukoAmagase", "ShusakuHayashi", "KaoruNishikawa", "EitaroAihara", "KojiTakeuchi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10620-007-9769-5"}

The latter series are characterized by higher rates of graft-related complications than in those in which AFB is used less frequently. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relative frequency and outcome of different types of bypass grafts in the surgical treatment of AAAs with iliac involvement, in our center and in others.\nBetween 1994 and 2004, 190 AAA patients with involvement of the iliac axes underwent elective repair in our department. Surgery was performed via median transperitoneal access.\nThe AAAs extended to the common iliac artery (CIA) in 90.5% of patients. The remaining 9.5% extended to the external iliac artery (EIA). Aorto bi-iliac grafts were used in 159 cases, straight tube grafts in 13, aorto EIA grafts in 15, and AFBs in 3. Overall 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 12.1% and 2.6%, respectively. At follow-up (mean: 5.6 years), one distal limb infection of an AFB and 4 CIA/EIA aneurysmal enlargements occurred and were repaired accordingly. Secondary patency and 5-year cumulative survival rate were 100% and 80%, respectively.\nIn this series of AAAs extending to the iliac axes, AFB was used selectively (1.6%), even when the AAA extended to the EIA.

PPARalpha also regulates the expression of Cyp4a fatty acid omega-hydroxylases and Cyp2c arachidonic acid epoxygenase genes. To study the role of the PPARalpha receptor and of its Cyp2c epoxygenase gene target in tumorigenesis, we treated mice injected with tumor cells with Wy-14,643, a PPARalpha-selective ligand. Compared with untreated controls, Wy-14643-treated animals showed marked reductions in tumor growth and vascularization, which were accompanied by decreases in the plasma levels of pro-angiogenic epoxygenase metabolites (EETs), hepatic EET biosynthesis, and Cyp2c epoxygenase expression. All these Wy-14643-induced responses were absent in PPARalpha(-/-) mice and are thus PPARalpha-mediated. Primary cultures of mouse lung endothelial cells treated with Wy-14643 showed reductions in cell proliferation and in the formation of capillary-like structures. These effects were absent in cells obtained from PPRAalpha(-/-) mice and reversed by the addition of EETs.

The present study examined the role of the EP4 receptor in regulating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis. Primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from EP4(flox/flox) mice and were rendered null for the EP4 receptor with adenoCre virus. Whereas treatment with PGE(2) or the EP4 selective agonists PGE(1)-OH and ONO-AE1-329 induced migration, tubulogenesis, ERK activation and cAMP production in control adenovirus-transduced endothelial EP4(flox/flox) cells, no effects were seen in adenoCre-transduced EP4(flox/flox) cells. The EP4 agonist-induced endothelial cell migration was inhibited by ERK, but not PKA inhibitors, defining a functional link between PGE(2)-induced endothelial cell migration and EP4-mediated ERK signaling. Finally, PGE(2), as well as PGE(1)-OH and ONO-AE1-329, also promoted angiogenesis in an in vivo sponge assay providing evidence that the EP4 receptor mediates de novo vascularization in vivo.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2007-04-03", "authors": ["ReenaRao", "ReyadhRedha", "InesMacias-Perez", "YanSu", "ChuanmingHao", "RoyZent", "Matthew DBreyer", "AmbraPozzi"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M701214200"}
{"title": "Connexin30 deficiency causes instrastrial fluid-blood barrier disruption within the cochlear stria vascularis.", "abstract": "The endocochlear potential (EP) is essential to hearing, because it provides approximately half of the driving force for the mechanoelectrical transduction current in auditory hair cells. The EP is produced by the stria vascularis (SV), a vascularized bilayer epithelium of the cochlea lateral wall. The absence of the gap junction protein connexin30 (Cx30) in Cx30(-/-) mice results in the SV failure to produce an EP, which mainly accounts for the severe congenital hearing impairment of these mice. Here, we show that the SV components of the EP electrogenic machinery and the epithelial barriers limiting the intrastrial fluid space, which are both necessary for the EP production, were preserved in Cx30(-/-) mice. In contrast, the endothelial barrier of the capillaries supplying the SV was disrupted before EP onset. This disruption is expected to result in an intrastrial electric shunt that is sufficient to account for the absence of the EP production. Immunofluorescence analysis of wild-type mice detected Cx30 in the basal and intermediate cells of the SV but not in the endothelial cells of the SV capillaries. Moreover, dye-coupling experiments showed that endothelial cells were not coupled to the SV basal, intermediate, and marginal cells. SV transcriptome analysis revealed a significant down-regulation of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (Bhmt) in the Cx30(-/-) mice, which was restricted to the SV and resulted in a local increase in homocysteine, a known factor of endothelial dysfunction.

An association between microvessel density, a measure of tumor angiogenesis, and conventional prognostic variables has been shown for many different tumor entities. In extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the VEGF expression and microvessel density have rarely been investigated.\nParaffin-embedded specimens from 51 resected adenocarcinomas of the extrahepatic bile duct were immunostained for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) and CD 34 to evaluate the microvessel density (MVD). VEGF A staining was evaluated by combining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells, as low (expression equal or below the median), or high (above the median). Microvessel density was assessed using a method published by Weidner et al.\nMedian disease free survival (DFS) of the study group was 12.5 months (range, 1-66.3 months). DFS was calculated in the 39 patients with complete resection.

Colony-forming units of endothelial progenitor cells (CFU-EC) are used to quantify EPC circulating in human peripheral blood. The mechanisms underlying colony formation and the nature of the contributing cells are not clear. We performed subtractive CFU-EC analyses to determine the impact of various blood cell types and kinetics of protein and gene expression during colony formation. We found that CFU-EC mainly comprise T cells and monocytes admixed with B cells and natural killer cells. The combination of purified T cells and monocytes formed CFU-EC structures. The lack of colonies after depletion or functional ablation of T cells or monocytes was contrasted with effective CFU-EC formation in the absence of CD34+ cells. Microarray analyses revealed activation of immune function-related biological processes without changes in angiogenesis-related processes during colony formation. In concordance with a regenerative function, soluble factors derived from CFU-EC cultures supported vascular network formation in vitro. Recognizing CFU-EC formation as the result of a functional cross between T cells and monocytes shifts expectations of vascular regenerative medicine.

{"title": "Survival and differentiation of pituitary colony-forming cells in vivo.", "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is a significant clinical problem, since growth hormone is essential for the regulation of growth, metabolism, and the cardiovascular system. Stem and progenitor cells have been identified in many adult tissues. Recently, our laboratory identified a cell type within the adult pituitary gland with stem cell-like properties, which we have termed pituitary colony-forming cells (PCFCs). Herein we investigate the ability of PCFCs to survive and differentiate in vivo. Enriched populations of PCFCs were transplanted into an in vivo microchamber model. Grafts were harvested at 6 weeks post-transplant and tested for surviving donor cells (LacZ(+)) or for differentiation (GH(+)). The results showed that donor cells survived in chambers (LacZ(+)) and underwent division (phosphohistone-H3-positive). Furthermore, grafted cells showed colocalization of LacZ and GH, suggesting differentiation. To confirm differentiation, donor cells were obtained from a GH-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter transgenic mouse model that expressed eGFP under control of the GH promoter. Cells that were eGFP(-), that is, GH(-), were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transplanted. After 6 weeks, eGFP(+)GH(+) cells were detected in grafts by immunostaining and by FACS analysis of digested grafts. In conclusion, PCFCs have the capacity to divide and differentiate into GH(+) cells in vivo. The vascularized tissue chamber model is an ideal model to investigate the environmental niche for PCFC expansion and differentiation and has the potential to be developed into a growth hormone-releasing organoid in vivo.

{"title": "Revascularization and remodelling of pancreatic islets grafted under the kidney capsule.", "abstract": "The revascularization and the structural changes resulting from interactions between the graft and the host were investigated in transplanted pancreatic islets under the kidney capsule. Islets were isolated from mice pancreata and transplanted in syngeneic diabetic animals. Graft-bearing kidneys were collected on different days post-transplant and processed for light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. A numerical analysis was performed in order to compare the percentage number of the different types of cells in native islets and at different time points after the transplant. Recipient animals reversed diabetes within 4 days. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed to determine islet functionality under stressful conditions. During the initial few days post-transplant, the islets showed peculiar shapes and the graft tended to aggregate along the vessels. Starting at days 4-7 post-transplant, islets were revascularized from vessels connected to both the cortical and the capsular vascular network of the kidney. From day 7-14 post-transplant, the vessels progressively appeared more similar in features and size to those of in situ pancreatic islets. Both the percentage number of the different cell types and the distribution of Alpha, Beta and Delta cells inside the graft were significantly different as compared with intact islets, demonstrating quantitative and structural changes after the engraftment. No concomitant proliferation of Beta cells was detected using a bromodeoxyuridin staining method. Despite the fact that quick revascularization preserved a large mass of tissue, the remodelling process of the graft and the newly formed vascularization led to a different organization of the endocrine tissue as compared with intact in situ islets.

Poorly differentiated HCC had a higher degree of vascularization than other stages and Epo/EpoR expression in both tumour and endothelial cells increased in parallel with grade of malignancy and was highly correlated with the extent of angiogenesis.\nEpo/EpoR levels correlate with angiogenesis and progression of patients with HCC and these findings suggest the presence of a loop in the Epo/EpoR system, i.e. Epo is secreted by hepatic tumour cells and it affects vascular endothelial cells via its receptors and promotes angiogenesis in a paracrine manner.

In 16 unembalmed cadaveric forearms, the radial artery was slowly injected with acrylic resin through the brachial artery and the superficial flexor compartment was dissected. The flap was raised from the lateral and medial sides of the forearm toward the axis represented by the radial artery, and the characteristics (number, diameter, site and interval of origin, and course) of its collaterals were evaluated. In the proximal forearm, the vessels were less numerous (mean values 8.6 vs. 11.5, P < 0.05) but larger in diameter (mean values 0.7 vs. 0.4 mm, P < 0.05) than in the distal forearm. The first four proximal perforator arteries originated within a mean distance of 4.3 cm from the origin of the radial artery, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.8-4.8 cm. The perforator arteries followed the axis of the forearm and anastomosed in the fascial plane, forming longitudinal fan-shaped arterial chains, giving rise to an epifascial vascular network.

To accomplish this we collected a series of 10 enchondromas and 57 chondrosarcomas (conventional, n = 17; mesenchymal, n = 20; clear cell, n = 20), and investigated the expression of Runx2 and Ihh in these cartilaginous tumors by immunohistochemistry. Cellular and matrix-rich areas were evaluated separately. Runx2 was expressed in 100% of conventional, mesenchymal, and clear cell chondrosarcomas, and in 30% of enchondromas. Higher levels of expression of Runx2 were found in cellular areas than in matrixrich areas. Expression levels increased with increasing histological grade in conventional chondrosarcoma, suggesting involvement in tumor progression. Ihh was expressed in 100% of conventional and clear cell chondrosarcomas, especially in matrix-rich areas. Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas revealed only focal expression of Ihh in matrix-rich areas. Small cell areas were negative. Ihh was absent or focally expressed in enchondromas. These findings demonstrate that Runx2 expression is active in variable chondrosarcomas compared to enchondromas, suggesting its importance in growth and differentiation of neoplastic cartilage. Ihh expression is considered a marker of the hypertrophic stage of differentiation in these tumor cells.", "journal": "Pathology oncology research : POR", "date": "2007-03-28", "authors": ["Hye-RimPark", "Yong-KooPark"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02893438"}

Density of lymphocyte subpopulations, macrophages, dendritic cells and CD34(+) microvessels was determined by immunohistochemistry in primary tumor samples from fifty-two patients with melanoma thicker than 1 mm. Intratumoral MVD did not show significant association with infiltration for any of these cell types. In the case of peritumoral reactive cell densities analyzed in the whole patient population, a positive correlation of MVD was found with CD3(+) T cell density. This association was stronger in melanomas >4.0 mm and in visceral metastatic tumors. In these subgroups similar phenomenon was observed for CD8(+) cells. We found significant correlation of MVD with CD68(+) macrophage density only in the highest thickness category, and weak associations with B-cell and dendritic cell infiltration in visceral metastatic cases. MVD did not vary significantly in tumors categorized according to thickness, localization, ulceration or histological type. However, both intratumoral MVD and macrophage infiltration were significantly higher in male patients compared to females.

Here, we show a new way of endothelial differentiation that involves the specific modulation of monocytes by the tumour environment. The tumour milieu is characterized by the presence of cytokines and lactate which induce the differentiation of tumour-invading monocytes into tumour-associated dendritic cells (DC). Additional incubation of tumour-associated DC with pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and oncostatin M, led to transdifferentiation into endothelial-like cells. The cells showed strong expression of von Willebrand factor and VE-Cadherin, both classical EC markers, while leukocytic markers were reduced.

Patients who had previously undergone hypospadias repair had 3 to 7 failed trials. Two stage buccal mucosa graft was performed using the Bracka technique. In the first stage residual fibrosis was released, the glans was split and the buccal mucosa graft was sutured to the ventral surface of the penis to form a future urethral plate. Second stage reconstruction was performed after 6 months with interposed scrotal dartos tissue. Buccal mucosa was histologically studied before grafting, and at 6 months after graft uptake and exposure to the air.\nBuccal mucosa free graft showed excellent uptake within 5 days in all cases. At 6 months the buccal mucosa was well vascularized and pliable. Minute fistulas occurred in 3 cases (9.7%), which were closed at a later stage.

Inadequate placental vascular development is associated with early pregnancy losses and other pregnancy related pathologies. In addition to the ubiquitous, well-characterized angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), some pregnancy-specific factors (e.g. human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) or alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were recently described to play a possible regulatory role in this process. In the present study we described an improved separation method for human placental microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC) and their functional characterization. Using the combination of enzymatic digestion and multistep immunomagnetic sorting with CD31 antibodies a model for villous vascularization was established. Isolated cells took up ac-dil-LDL, spontaneously formed capillary-like structures, and expressed common endothelial markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), angiopoetin-1 and -2, Tie-2, CD144, thrombomodulin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) as shown by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The expression of the hCG/LH receptor in the placental vascular tree was verified both in vitro and in vivo. hCG stimulated proliferation of HPMVEC in a dose specific manner. While hCG alone had no significant effect on endothelial cell apoptosis, the combination of VEGF-A and hCG protected HPMVEC from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. hCG significantly stimulated sprout formation when compared to controls in a spheroid angiogenesis assay.

An appropriate procedure for isolating EPCs from UCB is a key issue for improving therapeutic efficacy and eliminating the unexpected expansion of nonessential cells. Here we report a novel method for isolating EPCs from UCB by a combination of negative immunoselection and cell culture techniques. In addition, we divided EPCs into 2 subpopulations according to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. We found that EPCs with low ALDH activity (Alde-Low) possess a greater ability to proliferate and migrate compared to those with high ALDH activity (Alde-High). Moreover, hypoxia-inducible factor proteins are up-regulated and VEGF, CXCR4, and GLUT-1 mRNAs are increased in Alde-Low EPCs under hypoxic conditions, while the response was not significant in Alde-High EPCs. In fact, the introduction of Alde-Low EPCs significantly reduced tissue damage in ischemia in a mouse flap model.

We observed that hPar1 antisense clones exhibit low PAR1 levels, attenuated cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumor formation in vivo. These clones showed noticeably reduced paxillin phosphorylation compared with the parental A375SM cells, whereas no change in the integrin levels was noticed. Antisense clones injected into the mice resulted in very few and only occasional small tumors, whereas advanced and vascularized tumors were observed in A375SM cells. The antisense-derived tumor sections expressed active caspase-3, increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling staining, and a markedly reduced proliferating cell nuclear antigen level compared with A375SM cell-derived tissue sections. Likewise, ablation of the hPar1 gene in a tetracycline-inducible hPar1 system leads to apoptosis in immature blood vessels, whereas mature vessels were unaffected. The activation of PAR1-induced pAkt/protein kinase B abrogated serum-deprived Bim(EL) induction and also markedly inhibited Bax levels. On the other hand, small interfering RNA silencing of the hPar1 gene induced the expression of Bim(EL), a direct substrate of Akt/protein kinase B and also induced expression of active caspase-9 and caspase-3.

A classification into four groups was made based on the presence of cysts and the echogenicity of the lesion, then analysis of video recordings including Doppler with an interpretation chart: afferent vessel, color chart, spectrum shape (afferent vessel and within the malformation) to determine the contribution of Doppler within each group.\nFour lesions were avascular: bronchogenic cysts (three cases), subphrenic sequestration (one case). The other lesions were vascularized and color Doppler determined the source of vascularization feeding the malformation: branches of the pulmonary artery in 13 cases (eight cases of cystic adenomatoid disease, two cases of atresia, and three airway obstacles) or the aorta in seven cases (pulmonary sequestrations) with pulmonary venous return, six cases (intralobular sequestrations), or systemic venous return, one case (extralobular sequestration). The pulsed Doppler recording in the malformation (six cases) completed the color Doppler examination by showing the different spectrum shapes according to the aortic or pulmonary source of flow. The color chart matched in three cases (normal pulmonary segmentation) and was heterogeneous in eight cases (parenchymatous dysplasia). Furthermore, perfusion intensity was correlated with lesion progression.\nColor Doppler and pulsed Doppler provided a more precise diagnosis of these malformations and seems to contribute prognostic information.", "journal": "Journal de radiologie", "date": "2007-03-21", "authors": ["MBrasseur-Daudruy", "DEurin", "VIckowicz", "ALiard", "EVerspyck", "PLe Dosseur"], "doi": "10.1016/s0221-0363(07)89814-3"}
{"title": "Increased activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is associated with early embryonic lethality in Commd1 null mice.", "abstract": "COMMD1 (previously known as MURR1) belongs to a novel family of proteins termed the copper metabolism gene MURR1 domain (COMMD) family. The 10 COMMD family members are well conserved between vertebrates, but the functions of most of the COMMD proteins are unknown. We recently established that COMMD1 is associated with the hepatic copper overload disorder copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers. Recent in vitro studies indicate that COMMD1 has multiple functions, including sodium transport and NF-kappaB signaling. To elucidate the function of Commd1 in vivo, we generated homozygous Commd1 null (Commd1(-/-)) mice. Commd1(-/-) embryos died in utero between 9.5 and 10.5 days postcoitum (dpc), their development was generally retarded, and placenta vascularization was absent. Microarray analysis identified transcriptional upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) target genes in 9.5-dpc Commd1(-/-) embryos compared to normal embryos, a feature that was associated with increased Hif-1alpha stability. Consistent with these observations, COMMD1 physically associates with HIF-1alpha and inhibits HIF-1alpha stability and HIF-1 transactivation in vitro. Thus, this study identifies COMMD1 as a novel regulator of HIF-1 activity and shows that Commd1 deficiency in mice leads to embryonic lethality associated with dysregulated placenta vascularization.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2007-03-21", "authors": ["Bartvan de Sluis", "PatriciaMuller", "KarenDuran", "AmyChen", "Arjan JGroot", "Leo WKlomp", "Paul PLiu", "CiscaWijmenga"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.01932-06\n10.1016/j.placenta.2006.11.006"}
{"title": "Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of vascular permeability and extracellular volume fraction of breast tumors by dynamic Gd-DTPA-enhanced relaxometry.", "abstract": "Vascular permeability (k(ep), min(-1)) and extracellular volume fraction (v(e)) are tissue parameters of great interest to characterize malignant tumor lesions. Indeed, it is well known that tumors with high blood supply better respond to therapy than poorly vascularized tumors, and tumors with large extracellular volume tend to be more malignant than tumors showing lower extracellular volume. Furthermore, the transport of therapeutic agents depends on both extracellular volume fraction and vessel permeability. Thus, before treatment, these tissue parameters may prove useful to evaluate tumor aggressiveness and to predict responsiveness to therapy and variations during cytotoxic therapies could allow to assess treatment efficacy and early modified therapy schedules in case of poor responsiveness. As a consequence, there is a need to develop methods that could be routinely used to determine these tissue parameters. In this work, blood-tissue permeability and extracellular volume fraction information were derived from magnetic resonance imaging dynamic longitudinal relaxation rate (R(1)) mapping obtained after an intravenous bolus injection of Gd-DTPA in a group of 92 female patients with breast lesions, 68 of these being histologically proven to be with carcinoma. For the sake of comparison, 24 benign lesions were studied. The measurement protocol based on two-dimensional gradient echo sequences and a monoexponential plasma kinetic model was that validated in the occasion of previous animal experiments. As a consequence of neoangiogenesis, results showed a higher permeability in malignant than in benign lesions, whereas the extracellular volume fraction value did not allow any discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. The method, which can be easily implemented whatever the imaging system used, could advantageously be used to quantify lesion parameters (k(ep) and v(e)) in routine clinical imaging. Because of its large reproducibility, the method could be useful for intersite comparisons and follow-up studies.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "date": "2007-03-21", "authors": ["DominiqueVincensini", "V\u00e9roniqueDedieu", "Pierre AEliat", "CorineVincent", "CorineBailly", "Jacquesde Certaines", "FrancisJoffre"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mri.2006.10.016"}

Nicotine, an active alkaloid in tobacco, has been implicated in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that oral nicotine administration (50 or 200 microg/ml) for 25 days stimulated growth of human colon cancer xenograft in nude mice. It also increased vascularization in the tumors and elevated cotinine and adrenaline plasma levels. beta-Adrenoceptors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor tissues were also increased by nicotine. I.p. injection of beta(1)-selective antagonist (atenolol, 5 or 10 mg/kg) or beta(2)-selective antagonist (ICI 118,551, 5, or 10 mg/kg) blocked the nicotine-stimulated tumor growth dose dependently, in which beta(2)-selective antagonist produced a more prominent effect. beta-Adrenoceptors blockade also abrogated the stimulatory action of nicotine on microvessel densities as well as cell expression of COX-2, PGE(2), and VEGF, in which beta(2)-selective antagonist produced a significant effect. These findings provide a direct evidence that nicotine can enhance colon tumor growth mediated partly by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, preferentially the beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Activation of beta-adrenoceptors and the subsequent stimulation of COX-2, PGE(2), and VEGF expression is perhaps an important mechanism in the tumorigenic action of nicotine on colon tumor growth.

In this study, we describe an approach to in vivo cellular repopulation of a tissue-derived tubular elastin scaffold. Pure elastin scaffolds were prepared from porcine carotid arteries (elastin tubes). Elastin tubes were filled with agarose gel containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to allow sustained release of growth factor. These tubes were implanted in subdermal pouches in adult rats. The elastin tubes with growth factor had significantly more cell infiltration at 28 days than those without growth factor. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that most of these cells were fibroblasts, of which a few were activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts). Microvasculature was also observed within the scaffolds. Macrophage infiltration was seen at 7 days, which diminished by 28 days of implantation. None of the elastin tubes with bFGF calcified. These results demonstrated that the sustained release of bFGF brings about repopulation of elastin scaffolds in vivo while inhibiting calcification.

Given the widespread incidence of diabetes type II and lifelong exposure of these patients to TZDs, there is a possibility that chronic treatment with TZD modifies clinical phenotypes of other common human diseases, for example breast carcinoma. There is evidence that TZDs act as breast carcinoma suppression agents, at least in the in vitro and animal models. Stimulation of the PPARgamma by TZDs interferes with oestrogen receptor signalling, STAT5B and NF-kappaB signalling cascades. On the other hand, TZDs repress TGFbeta signalling, a well-known suppressor of the initial stages of breast carcinoma development. Another layer of complexity arises at the later stages of tumour development, when TGFbeta acts as a tumour promoter: its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, higher degree of tumour vascularization and metastasis. Longitudinal studies of breast carcinoma development in chronic TZD users are needed. In this review, we dissect possible interplays between chronic exposure of breast tis-sue to TZDs and TGFbeta signalling and predict influence of TZD exposure on cancer-related clinical outcome.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2007-03-21", "authors": ["Mohammed HJarrar", "AnchaBaranova"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00003.x"}

{"title": "An overview on the toxic morphological changes in the retinal pigment epithelium after systemic compound administration.", "abstract": "Many medications that are administered systemically for nonocular conditions may evoke ocular toxicological complications. Therefore, the eye is routinely investigated histopathologically in preclinical in vivo toxicity studies. The retinal pigment epithelium is a likely target for systemically administered compounds, since the underlying choroid is highly vascularized. The specialized pigment epithelium has numerous functions that all maintain the integrity and function of photoreceptors. Consequently, toxic effects on the pigment epithelium will eventually affect the neural retina. The potential of pigment epithelial cells to respond to toxic injury is limited, but a standardized terminology to describe its morphological changes does not exist in the scientific literature. Detailed morphologic analysis, however, might allow early detection of retinotoxicity and may provide evidence on the underlying pathomechanism. We here review toxic effects on the pigment epithelium focusing in particular on the morphology of toxic cell injury. Morphological changes comprise hypertrophy, intracytoplasmic accumulation of cellular components, loss of cell polarity, degeneration, metaplasia, and formation of subretinal membranes. Some of these changes are reversible whereas others are permanent, leading to impaired function of the pigment epithelium and eventually to photoreceptor loss and retinal atrophy.", "journal": "Toxicologic pathology", "date": "2007-03-17", "authors": ["LarsMecklenburg", "UlrichSchraermeyer"], "doi": "10.1080/01926230601178199"}
{"title": "The KTP-(greenlight-) laser--principles and experiences.", "abstract": "The most recent advance in laser technology for transurethral prostatectomy is represented by the KTP laser. A potassium-titanyl-phosphate-(KTP-) crystal doubles the frequency of pulsed Neodymium: Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser energy to a 532 nm wavelength, which is in the green electromagnetic spectrum (Greenlight-laser) and is selectively absorbed by hemoglobin and not at all by water. Reducing the wavelength leads to a completely different interaction between laser beam and prostatic tissue. In contrast to the early clinical experiences with the Nd:YAG lasers in which vaporization was observed as a side-effect during the procedure, the new KTP laser offers an immediate and efficient vaporization, leading to real tissue ablation. Because of the instant and nearly complete absorption in blood, the depth in vascularized tissue such as prostate is only 0.8 mm. The superficial coagulation prevents the large tissue necrosis that is seen with the Nd:YAG laser, leading to long lasting irritative symptoms due to sloughing of necrotic tissue. Initial experiences, made with a 60W KTP system, demonstrated that the procedure was as effective as conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with a lower intraoperative complication rate. In order to speed up vaporization of the prostate laser power has been increased to 80W. The 80W KTP laser combines the tissue debulking properties of TURP and the favourable safety profile of laser surgery. With the new 120W High Performance System, introduced in 2006, vaporization will become more powerful and faster.

However, the Doppler measurements provided only the summation of blood flow in a number of vessels covered by the sensing probe, but did not give data on flow in individual vessels.\nIn the present work the authors introduced into the bloodstream of Gloydius and Trimeresurus pit vipers fluorescent microspheres labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) contained in a solution of FITC-dextran in physiological saline. They observed the passage of the microspheres through individual pit organ vessels with a fluorescent microscope to which was attached a high-speed video camera and image intensifier. Output of the camera was recorded before, during, and after stimulus with a 810-nm diode laser. Recording was done at 250 frames/s on high-speed video apparatus and downloaded to a hard disk. Disk files were loaded into proprietary software and particles were tracked and average velocities calculated. The data were then tested for significance by ANOVA with post hoc tests.\nA significant (p<.05) increase in blood velocity was found at the focal point of the stimulus laser, but not anywhere removed from this point. Proximal severing of the pit sensory nerves caused degeneration of the pit receptor terminals and abolished stimulus-induced blood flow changes, but did not affect normal blood flow.\nThe authors conclude that the receptors themselves are directly and locally controlling the smooth muscle elements of the blood vessels, in response to heating of the receptors by infrared radiation.

Recently, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been identified as a critical regulator of oncogenic protein stability, including EGFR, HER-2, and HIF-1alpha. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hsp90 impairs EGF- and hypoxia-mediated angiogenic signaling in gastric cancer cells and consequently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. In vitro, the geldanamycin derivate 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) led to marked reduction in constitutive and inducible activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha protein. In addition, EGFR and HER-2 were down-regulated after Hsp90 inhibition. With respect to regulation of angiogenic molecules, 17-AAG significantly reduced EGF-mediated VEGF secretion. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were both abrogated by 17-AAG, which resulted in significant impairment of cancer cell motility. Interestingly, cytotoxic effects of 17-AAG in vitro were higher on cancer cells and gastric fibroblasts than on pericytes. In vivo, the water-soluble compound 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; 25 mg/kg, thrice per week) significantly reduced s.c. xenografted tumor growth. By immunohistochemistry, 17-DMAG significantly reduced vessel area and numbers of proliferating tumor cells in sections. Furthermore, similar significant growth-inhibitory effects of 17-DMAG were achieved when administered as low-dose therapy (5 mg/kg, thrice per week). In conclusion, blocking Hsp90 disrupts multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells and inhibits xenografted tumor growth in vivo.

Therefore, by gene replacement technology, we engineered mice to express a humanized form of VEGF-A (hum-X VEGF) that is recognized by many anti-VEGF antibodies and has biochemical and biological properties comparable with WT mouse and human VEGF-A. The hum-X VEGF mouse model was then used to compare the activity and safety of a panel of VEGF Mabs with different affinities for VEGF-A.

Twenty-one synchronized Merino sheep underwent harvesting of their intact ovaries with vascular pedicles. Autotransplantation was performed with fresh (n = 6) and cryopreserved-thawed (C-T; n = 15) ovaries. The ovarian vessels were anastomosed to the deep inferior epigastric vessels using end-to-end (n = 8), end-to-side (n = 6) and fish-mouth modification (n = 7) techniques. Patency of the anastomosis, ischaemia time, hormonal functions and histology were evaluated. In addition, ovarian harvesting techniques in two human subjects were described. Possible autotransplantation sites in humans were suggested. In all, 33.3% (7/21) of all fresh and C-T transplants showed patency after 10 days of follow-up. Patency was observed in 5/8, 2/6 and 0/7 animals using end-to-end, end-to-side and fish-mouth modification for completion of the microvascular anastomosis respectively. Use of the fish mouth modification technique was associated with significantly higher ischaemia time compared with end-to-end (P < 0.01) and end-to-side (P = 0.05) anastomosis.

It has been reported that meningiomas express variability in glycosylation properties; however only limited meningioma subtypes have been studied with lectins histochemistry. The aim of this study was to compare the binding pattern of biotinylated lectins in seven subtypes of histologically benign intracranial meningiomas (meningothelial, transitional, fibroblastic, psammomatous, secretory, microcystic and angiomatous types). The study was performed on biopsy material of 30 cases of meningiomas with different lectins: Peanut agglutinin (PNA), Soybean agglutinin (SBA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Cocanavalin A (Con A) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1). The expression of lectin-binding glycoconjugates exhibited differences between certain subtypes of meningiomas. WGA with affinity for GlcNAc and neuraminic acid labelled the cells of all meningiomas but most intensely those of fibroblastic type. Staining with PNA, SBA and DBA, which are GalNAc specific, varied from negative to strongly positive. Enhanced PNA reactivity reflected mainly cytoarchitectural pattern of tumour growth, such as syncytial lobules, whorled formations or trabecular arrangements of meningioma cells. DBA labelled the majority of cellular nuclei. SBA showed binding to psammoma bodies, while pseudopsammoma bodies were stained with PNA, WGA, Con A, and to a lesser extent with SBA and DBA. The secretory meningiomas exhibited strong and heterogeneous lectins reactivity within pseudopsammoma bodies whereas the neoplastic cells were only occasionally stained. The selective reactivity of UEA-1 with endothelial cells of blood vessels resulted in a specific visualisation of the vascular network in all histological subtypes of meningiomas. These results documented the heterogeneous glycosylation pattern in different subtypes of meningiomas and indicate the usefulness of lectins in the evaluation of pluripotential differentiation of meningioma cells.", "journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "date": "2007-03-16", "authors": ["AnnaTaraszewska", "EwaMatyja"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Clinicopathological considerations on angiogenic potential in neuroblastoma Schwannian stroma - poor tumours.", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine microscopic angiogenic parameters of neuroblastoma (NB) Schwannian stroma-poor tumours. Furthermore the associations between vascular parameters and clinicopathological features of tumours and basic prognostic factors were analysed. Examined tissue samples from 62 NB came from 39 untreated and 23 chemotherapy pretreated tumours. The clinicopathological data comprised: patients' age, gender, survival, tumour site and stage, tumour histology and MYCN status.The morphological analysis of the angiogenic potential concentrated on examination of vascular patterns - classical type or pathological angiogenesis with mural microvascular proliferation (MVP). The quantitative study included semi-automatic assessment of vascular density (VD) in CD34 stained tumour sections. Pathologic angiogenesis with MVP, including simple and/or glomeruloid type, was encountered in 25 cases and was more frequent in differentiating histology subtype and extraadrenal tumours. VD value ranged from 56 to 385 vessels/mm2 (median 149). Higher VD was connected with younger patient's age. In untreated tumours VD was significantly higher in infants than in children over one year of age. Pathologic type angiogenesis and lower VD were found to be associated with shorter survival. Our study confirmed high vascularization of NB and revealed common occurrence of vascular pattern with MVP. Angiogenic potential in the analysed group showed diversity related to some clinicopathological tumour features. This points toward heterogeneity of NB tumours in vascular aspects, possibly affecting tumours' reactivity to antiangiogenic therapy.", "journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "date": "2007-03-16", "authors": ["EwaIzycka-Swieszewska", "ElzbietaDrozy\u0144ska", "RobertRzepko", "BozenaDembowska", "Wies\u0142awaGrajkowska", "AgnieszkaBrozyna", "DanutaPerek", "AnnaBalcerska", "KazimierzJa\u015bkiewicz"], "doi": null}

Here, we used retroviral transduction to generate vGPCR-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts that are tumorigenic in nude mice, but as expected fail to induce tumors in their immunocompetent counterparts. However, tumor fragments obtained from nude mice grow progressively in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Unexpectedly, vGPCR-expressing cells established from grafted tumor fragments gave rise to tumors in immunocompetent mice. These tumors exhibit a striking histological resemblance to KS including plump spindle cell morphology, a high degree of vascularization and brisk mitotic activity. High expression of vGPCR was confirmed in the cell lines and tumors using a newly developed vGPCR-specific monoclonal antibody. Finally, short interfering RNA directed at vGPCR abrogated or significantly delayed tumorigenesis in mice, demonstrating that the tumor development is specifically driven by vGPCR.

The bronchial mucosa is more vascularized in asthmatic patients than in healthy subjects, showing an increase in the number and dimension of vessels and vascular area. In addition, vascular changes can contribute to obstructing the airway flow in asthma. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, a mediator derived from endothelial cells, but also from most inflammatory cells in asthma, plays a primary role in vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Studies on lung biopsies showed that anti-asthma drugs can decrease to varying degrees the vascular component of airway remodelling in asthma. Among asthma medications, inhaled corticosteroids effectively reverse all aspects of vascular remodelling such as vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis. A better knowledge of angiogenetic mechanisms in asthma will support the selection of specific medications acting on this aspect of airway remodelling.

Due to its importance in the biomechanics and functionality of the wrist, it is important to depict and characterize the type of injury. Plain radiographs and scintigraphy may fail to disclose the type and severity of the injury. In patients with normal initial plain radiographs, MR imaging can discriminate occult fractures from bone bruises and may also demonstrate ligamentous disruption. MR imaging can also discriminate the proximal pole viability versus avascular necrosis secondary to previous fracture, which is important for treatment planning. Treatment of non-united fractures with vascularized grafts can be evaluated with contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Idiopathic osteonecrosis or Preiser's disease was originally described after trauma. The non-traumatic disorders of the scaphoid include post-traumatic osteoarthritis, inflammatory bone marrow edema in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and osteomyelitis. MR imaging is helpful in all the above disorders to demonstrate early bone marrow edema, cartilage degeneration and associated subchondral marrow changes. The most commonly found tumors in the scaphoid are usually benign and include enchondroma, osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma.

Two deep second-degree burn wounds on the backside of each of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats were created with a standard burning procedure by applying a heated plaque. Burned regions located right dorsolaterally and classified as group I lesions were treated with linear polarized polychromatic light + open dressing + antibacterial pomade, whereas group II lesions were located left dorsolaterally and treated with only open dressing + antibacterial pomade. Macroscopic evaluation was performed for determination of the completed wound closure rate, measurement of burn wound area, and investigation of macroscopic edema, hyperemia, and epithelialization. Histopathological evaluation included monitoring of epithelialization, vascularization, origination of granulation tissue, inflammatory cell response, and total histopathological score on days 7, 14, and 21 after burn creation. Macroscopic evaluation revealed more obvious epithelialization in group I lesions between days 6 and 15. The number of completely closed wounds was higher in group I than in group II on days 16 and 21. The average area of burn wounds was lower from day 5, hyperemia was less on days 2 to 17, and edema was less from day 4 to day 13 in group I lesions. Histopathological evaluation revealed a higher rate of epithelialization on day 7 and higher vascularization occurrence on day 21 in group I lesions. Linear polarized polychromatic light seems to be effective in the treatment of burn wounds and in the promotion of healing.

The ovaries were collected by transvaginal ovariectomy (n = 5, cows/group) and the follicles (n = 5, one follicle/cow) were classified into following groups: before GnRH administration [before luteinizing hormone (LH) surge]; 3-5 h after GnRH (during LH surge); 10 h after GnRH; 20 h after GnRH; 25 h after GnRH (peri-ovulation); and early CL (days 2-3). The mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (rotor-gene 3000). Angiopoietin-1 expression rapidly decreased at 3-5 h and kept low level at 10 h after GnRH treatment compared with that before GnRH, and returned to the level before LH surge in the follicles >20 h after GnRH treatment. The levels of ANPT-2 mRNA decreased at 10 and 25 h after treatment compared with other periods. The ratio of ANPT-2/ANPT-1 (an index for destabilization of blood vessels) increased in the follicles at 3-5 h after GnRH treatment only.

Since TNP has been shown to positively influence the perfusion of chronic, poorly vascularized wounds, the authors applied this therapeutic method to irradiated wounds and investigated the effect on tissue oxygenation in irradiated tissue in five patients.\nWith informed patients' consent, samples prior to and 4 and 8 days after continuous TNP with -125 mmHg were obtained during routine wound debridements. Granulation tissue was stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and additionally with CD31, HIF-1 alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha), and D2-40 to detect blood vessels, measure indirect signs of hypoxia, and lymph vessel distribution within the pre- and post-TNP samples.\nIn this first series of experiments, a positive influence of TNP onto tissue oxygenation in radiation-induced wounds could be demonstrated. TNP led to a significant decrease of 53% HIF-1 alpha-positive cell nuclei. At the same time, a slight reduction of CD31-stained capillaries was seen in comparison to samples before TNP. Immunostaining with D2-40 revealed an increased number of lymphatic vessels with distended lumina and an alteration of the parallel orientation within the post-TNP samples.\nThis study is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report on a novel previously not described histological marker to demonstrate the effects of TNP on HIF-1 alpha expression as an indirect marker of tissue oxygenation in irradiated wounds, as demonstrated by a reduction of HIF-1 alpha concentration after TNP.

In this study we aimed at studying the mechanisms underlying the angiogenic effects of angiotensin II under hypoxia in the mouse heart in vitro. Endothelial sprout formation from pieces of mouse hearts was assessed under normoxia (21% O(2)) and hypoxia (1% O(2)) during a 7-day period of in vitro culture. Only under hypoxia did angiotensin II dose-dependently induce endothelial sprout formation, peaking at 10(-7) mol/L of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade by losartan did not affect angiotensin II-induced sprouting in wild-type mice. Conversely, the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor antagonist PD 123319 blocked this response. In hearts from AT(1)(-/-) mice, angiotensin II-elicited sprouting was preserved but blocked again by AT(2) receptor antagonism. In contrast, no angiotensin II-induced sprouting was found in preparations from hearts of AT(2)(-/-) mice. Angiotensin II-mediated angiogenesis was also abolished by a specific inhibitor of the B2 kinin receptor in both wild-type and AT(1)(-/-) mice. Furthermore, angiotensin II failed to induce endothelial sprout formation in hearts from B2(-/-) mice. Finally, NO inhibition completely blunted sprouting in hearts from wild-type mice, whereas NO donors could restore sprouting in AT(2)(-/-) and B2(-/-) hearts.

A defined volume of fat flap based on the superficial inferior epigastric vascular pedicle in the rat was elevated and inset into a hollow plastic chamber implanted subcutaneously in the groin of the rat. The chamber walls were either perforated or solid and the chambers either contained poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) sponge matrix or not. The contents were analyzed after being in situ for 6 weeks. The total volume of the flap tissue in all groups except the control groups, where the flap was not inserted into the chambers, increased significantly, especially in the perforated chambers (0.08 +/- 0.007 mL baseline compared to 1.2 +/- 0.08 mL in the intact ones). Volume analysis of individual component tissues within the flaps revealed that the adipocyte volume increased and was at a maximum in the chambers without PLGA, where it expanded from 0.04 +/- 0.003 mL at insertion to 0.5 +/- 0.08 mL (1250% increase) in the perforated chambers and to 0.16 +/- 0.03 mL (400% increase) in the intact chambers.

{"title": "Internal thoracic vessels used as pedicle graft for anastomosis with vascularized bone graft to reconstruct C7-T3 spinal defects: a new technique.", "abstract": "A report of 4 cases of primary bone tumors (3 cases) or infection (1 case) at the cervicothoracic junction treated with resection-reconstruction.\nTo document a new technique using the internal thoracic vessels as recipient vessels for reconstruction of the cervicothoracic spine with free vascularized fibula grafts.\nThe cervicothoracic junction is a difficult region in reconstructive spinal surgery. Although nonvascularized fibula grafts can be used to reconstruct the osseous defect, compared with free vascularized fibula grafts they are biomechanical weaker, incorporate less well, are less resistant to infection, and remodel incomplete in time. However, when using free vascularized bone grafts, the selection of suitable recipient vessels remains one of the most critical decisions.\nFour patients who had a primary tumor (3 cases) or a severe progressive kyphotic deformity and progressive neurologic symptoms due to tuberculosis (1 case) were treated by resection and vascularized reconstruction. In 3 patients, a staged anteroposterior en bloc resection of T1-T3 (2 cases) or T1-T2 (1 case) was performed; the ventral reconstruction of the osseous defect consisted of a vascularized fibula graft interposition between C7-T4 (2 cases) or C7-T3 (1 case). In another case, an axial slot was milled through the T1-T2 vertebral bodies to accept an osteotomized vascularized fibular graft. In all cases, a free vascularized fibula graft was used: the vascular anastomosis was performed between the peroneal and the dissected and rerouted internal thoracic vessels. The anterior construction was strengthened by a ventral plate-screw system.\nThe resection-reconstruction procedures, including the dissection, rerouting, and anastomosis between the internal thoracic vessels and the peroneal vessels, were successfully performed. At present, all patients are alive, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease, unchanged, or improved neurologic with a mean follow-up of 28 months. All grafts are well incorporated. CONCLUSIONS.: A combined low anterolateral cervical and midsternal approach or a midline sternotomy allows not only a safe and excellent exposure to the cervicothoracic junction but also to the internal thoracic vessels. The internal thoracic vessels are appropriate donor vessels: its longevity, diameter, length, and rerouting capacity allow vascularized graft reconstruction of vertebral column defects of the low cervical (C6-C7) and/or upper thoracic (T1-T3) region.", "journal": "Spine", "date": "2007-03-06", "authors": ["HaiHu", "Henri A HWinters", "Rick M APaul", "Paul I J MWuisman"], "doi": "10.1097/01.brs.0000256383.29014.42"}
{"title": "Functional characterization of two p-coumaroyl ester 3'-hydroxylase genes from coffee tree: evidence of a candidate for chlorogenic acid biosynthesis.", "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) is one of the major soluble phenolic compounds that is accumulated in coffee green beans. With other hydroxycinnamoyl quinic acids (HQAs), this compound is accumulated in particular in green beans of the cultivated species Coffea canephora. Recent work has indicated that the biosynthesis of 5-CQA can be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP98A3 from Arabidopsis. Two full-length cDNA clones (CYP98A35 and CYP98A36) that encode putative p-coumaroylester 3'-hydroxylases (C3'H) were isolated from C. canephora cDNA libraries. Recombinant protein expression in yeast showed that both metabolized p-coumaroyl shikimate at similar rates, but that only one hydroxylates the chlorogenic acid precursor p-coumaroyl quinate. CYP98A35 appears to be the first C3'H capable of metabolising p-coumaroyl quinate and p-coumaroyl shikimate with the same efficiency. We studied the expression patterns of both genes on 4-month old C. canephora plants and found higher transcript levels in young and in highly vascularized organs for both genes. Gene expression and HQA content seemed to be correlated in these organs. Histolocalization and immunolocalization studies revealed similar tissue localization for caffeoyl quinic acids and p-coumaroylester 3'-hydroxylases. The results indicated that HQA biosynthesis and accumulation occurred mainly in the shoot tip and in the phloem of the vascular bundles. The lack of correlation between gene expression and HQA content observed in some organs is discussed in terms of transport and accumulation mechanisms.", "journal": "Plant molecular biology", "date": "2007-03-03", "authors": ["VenkataramaiahMahesh", "RachelMillion-Rousseau", "PascalineUllmann", "NathalieChabrillange", "Jos\u00e9Bustamante", "LaurenceMondolot", "MarcMorant", "MichelNoirot", "SergeHamon", "Alexandrede Kochko", "Dani\u00e8leWerck-Reichhart", "ClaudineCampa"], "doi": "10.1007/s11103-007-9141-3"}

Their regulation in the growth plate is crucial for normal vs. impaired matrix assembly. Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), a prevalent skeletal abnormality in avian species, is characterized by the formation of a nonvascularized, nonmineralized plaque in the growth plate. Here, we show differential regulation of MMPs in cultured chondrocytes from chickens and turkeys; retinoic acid (RA) elevated MMP-2 activity in both species, but only in chicken did it induce MMP-9 activity. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment induced MMP-9 activity in turkey chondrocytes but not in those of chicken. Moreover, we found different developmental patterns of TD in chickens and turkeys in-vivo as lower concentrations of, and shorter exposure to thiram were required in chicken than in turkey for TD induction. Growth-plate cartilage taken from thiram-induced lesions had lower gelatinolytic and caseinolytic activities compared with normal cartilage. Likewise, thiram reduced MMP-2 and MMP-13 activity in both chicken and turkey chondrocytes in vitro, although 10-fold higher concentrations were required for this effect in the latter. Finally, the combined treatments of RA or PMA with thiram induced MMP-9 activity in turkey but not in chicken chondrocytes. Furthermore, RA combined with thiram synergistically upregulated its activity in turkey but not chicken chondrocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that mechanisms of MMP regulation differ in the growth plates of these closely related avian species, resulting in altered matrix assembly as exemplified by TD development.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "In situ oxygen utilization in the rat intervertebral disc.", "abstract": "Nucleus pulposus cells of the intervertebral disc have no endogenous vasculature and have thus been hypothesized to be hypoxic. This hypothesis was tested using 2-nitroimidazole, EF5, a drug that at low oxygen concentrations forms covalent adducts with cellular proteins. After administrating EF5 to rats, sections of the intervertebral disc were analysed for EF5 adducts. Drug adducts were quantified in tissue sections using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. Although the level of EF5 fluorescence in all intervertebral disc tissues was low, the transition zone at the periphery of the nucleus pulposus exhibited the highest level of EF5 binding. To substantiate this result, tissue nitroreductase levels and drug pharmacology were evaluated. Nitroreductase levels were measured in whole discs under severe hypoxia. We noted that there was robust EF5 binding to cells in the annulus fibrosus and transition zone with modest binding to cells of the nucleus pulposus and endplate. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated limitations in EF5 access to the nucleus pulposus, most probably related to the lack of vasculature and slow drug distribution through the gel-like interior of the disc. However, despite diffusion problems, the drug dose was determined to be sufficient to report the oxygen status of the nucleus pulposus cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that despite poor vascularization, the disc cells accommodate to the local environment by displaying a limited need for oxygen.

MAN1 interacts with SMAD transcription factors, which in turn are regulated by the Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily of signaling molecules. To determine the role of MAN1 in mouse development, we used a gene-trap embryonic stem cell clone to derive mice with a functional mutation in MAN1 (Man1(GT/GT)). Expression of Man1 during early development is initially low but increases at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). Coincident with this increase, homozygous gene-trapped Man1 (Man1(GT/GT)) embryos die by E10.5. Examination of mutant embryos and tetraploid rescue experiments reveals that abnormal yolk-sac vascularization is the probable cause of lethality. We also established embryonic stem cell lines and their differentiated derivatives that are homozygous for the Man1(GT) allele. Using these lines, we show that the Man1(GT) allele results in increased phosphorylation, nuclear localization and elevated levels of SMAD transcriptional activity, predominantly of SMAD2/3, which are regulated by the ALK5 signaling pathway.

Two nidogen proteins, nidogen 1 and nidogen 2, are known in mammals.\nWe show that CpG islands of both NID1 and NID2 genes are aberrantly methylated in human cancer samples and cancer cell lines. For both genes, methylation was correlated with loss of gene transcription in human cell lines. Furthermore, demethylation of the NID1 and NID2 promoters restored gene transcription, demonstrating that methylation was responsible for silencing nidogen genes. In primary tumors, we detected NID1 promoter methylation in 67% of colon cancer samples and in 90% of gastric cancers. NID2 promoter was methylated in 29% of colon and 95% of gastric cancers. Immuno-staining for nidogen-2 confirmed the correlation between aberrant methylation and loss of nidogen expression also in primary tumors, implying that aberrant methylation was a mechanism for inhibiting nidogens expression in human gastrointestinal tumors.\nThese results suggest that loss of nidogens expression has a potential pathogenetic role in colon and stomach tumorigenesis. Nidogens are believed to connect laminin and collagen IV networks, hence stabilizing the basement membrane structure. Nidogens are also important for cell adhesion, as they establish contacts with various cellular integrins.

These TIE2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) accounted for 2% to 7% of blood mononuclear cells in healthy donors and were distinct from rare circulating endothelial cells and progenitors. In human cancer patients, TEMs were observed in the blood and, intriguingly, within the tumors, where they represented the main monocyte population distinct from TAMs. Conversely, TEMs were hardly detected in nonneoplastic tissues. In vitro, TEMs migrated toward angiopoietin-2, a TIE2 ligand released by activated endothelial cells and angiogenic vessels, suggesting a homing mechanism for TEMs to tumors. Purified human TEMs, but not TEM-depleted monocytes, markedly promoted angiogenesis in xenotransplanted human tumors, suggesting a potentially critical role of TEMs in human cancer progression.

Evaluation of implants at one week revealed an extensive network of human-specific lumenal structures containing erythrocytes, indicating formation of functional anastomoses with the host vasculature. Quantitative analyses showed the microvessel density was significantly superior to that generated by human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) but similar to that generated by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We also found that as EPCs were expanded in culture, their morphology, growth kinetics, and proliferative responses toward angiogenic factors progressively resembled those of HDMECs, indicating a process of in vitro maturation. This maturation correlated with a decrease in the degree of vascularization in vivo, which could be compensated for by increasing the number of EPCs seeded into the implants.

Other species of the genus cause similar lesions, the nature of which has been attributed, at least in part, to a viral-encoded vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that induces vascularization and dermal oedema through VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). The results of this study showed that BPSV strain V660 encodes a novel VEGF and that the predicted BPSV protein showed only 33-52% amino acid identity to VEGFs encoded by the other species of the genus. BPSV VEGF showed higher identity to mammalian VEGF-A (51%) than the other parapoxviral VEGFs (31-46%). Assays of the purified BPSV VEGF (BPSVV660VEGF) demonstrated that it was also functionally more similar to VEGF-A, as it showed significant binding to VEGFR-1 and induced monocyte migration. Like VEGF-A and the other viral VEGFs, BPSVV660VEGF bound VEGFR-2 with high affinity. Sequence analysis and structural modelling of BPSVV660VEGF revealed specific residues, outside the known receptor-binding face, that are predicted either to influence VEGF structure or to mediate binding directly to the VEGFRs. These results indicate that BPSVV660VEGF is a biologically active member of the VEGF family and that, via its interaction with VEGFR-2, it is likely to contribute to the proliferative and highly vascularized nature of BPSV lesions. This is also the first example of a viral VEGF acting via VEGFR-1 and influencing haematopoietic cell function.

{"title": "Hyperoxia improves oxygen consumption in the detached feline retina.", "abstract": "To investigate the effects of hyperoxia on retinal oxygenation and oxygen consumption in the detached feline retina.\nRetinal detachment was created in nine intact anesthetized cats by injecting 0.25% sodium hyaluronate in balanced salt solution into the subretinal space. Oxygen microelectrodes were used to collect spatial profiles of retinal Po(2) in both the attached and detached retina. A diffusion model was fitted to quantify photoreceptor oxygen consumption (Q(av)).\nIn the detached retina, the Po(2) at the border between the retina and the fluid layer under the retina decreased; hyperoxia increased it to a level that was not significantly different from the control (attached retina, air breathing). Detachment did not change the Po(2) at the border between the avascular and vascularized retina; hyperoxia significantly increased the level. Oxygen consumption decreased to 47% +/- 18% of the control value in the detached retina during normoxia; hyperoxia increased Q(av) to 68% +/- 17% of control. Hyperoxia increased the average inner retinal Po(2) (P(IR)) in the detached retina to a level higher than that during normoxia. Detachment did not change P(IR) during normoxia.\nHyperoxia has been shown to improve photoreceptor survival in the detached retina. The present work suggests that hyperoxia is protective because it allowed increased photoreceptor oxygen consumption.

{"title": "Role of color Doppler ultrasonography in the preoperative management of cold thyroid nodules.", "abstract": "To evaluate the application of color flow Doppler (CFD) sonography in the preoperative management of benign and malignant cold thyroid nodules.\nEighty-five patients with a cold thyroid nodule larger than 1cm were examined with CFD sonography prior to thyroidectomy. The histological examination revealed that 18 (21%) patients had malignant nodules and 67 (79%) had benign ones. The sonographic characteristics of the nodules used for evaluation were: a) absence of vascularization, b) presence of peripheral vascularization, c) presence of central vascularization and d) size of the nodule. The correlations between the pre-operative sonographic characteristics, as defined above, and the histological findings of the nodules were determined. results: The results showed that the vascular signals were absent in 4/18 (22%) of malignant nodules and 16/67 (23%) of benign ones. The smaller nodules (<2.5 cm.) were more frequently avascular (15/37=40%) compared to the larger ones (5/48=10%) (p<0.05). Moreover, for the nodules with vascularization, the peripheral distribution of vascularization was more frequently encountered in benign nodules (p<0.01 specificity=0.77, sensitivity=0.46), while central vascularization was more frequent in malignant ones (p<0.01, specificity=0.70, sensitivity=0.66). Thus, absence of vascularization in a nodule does not exclude the probability of malignancy, since vascularization depends on the size rather than the histological features of the nodule. Furthermore, for the vascularized nodules, peripheral distribution of vascularization is a characteristic of benignancy with high specificity, while central distribution is a characteristic of malignancy with medium specificity.\nCFD sonography contributes to the differential diagnosis of the large vascularized nodules, but it is less helpful in the smaller non-vascularized ones.", "journal": "Hormones (Athens, Greece)", "date": "2007-02-28", "authors": ["EmmanuelVarverakis", "EvaggelosNeonakis", "MariaTzardi", "EmmanuelChrysos"], "doi": null}

Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography served to evaluate the anatomical outcome in a 6-month follow-up (12 months in 7 patients).\nPreoperative visual acuity (VA) ranged from 20/800 to 20/40 (mean, 0.6+/-0.4 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), and reading vision from 1.1 to 0.5 logRAD (mean, 0.8+/-0.2). Three patients were unable to read. Six months after surgery, VA ranged from hand movements to 20/32, with an increase of > or =5 letters in 2 eyes. Two patients without reading ability preoperatively were able to read after surgery. Reading was possible in a total of 8 patients after 6 months (1.3-0.4 logRAD). In 7 patients who were observed for 1 year, VA remained stable (+/-1 line) in 5 eyes and decreased in 2 eyes between 6 months' and 1 year's follow-up. In all eyes but 2, revascularization was visible on indocyanine green angiography as early as 3 weeks after surgery. Autofluorescence of the RPE was independent of revascularization of the graft and persisted throughout follow-up. Four eyes had unstable fixation and/or extrafoveal fixation before surgery. Two of these eyes stabilized during follow-up. Areas overlying atrophic areas demonstrated low threshold sensitivities that persisted after translocation of a free graft with only limited recovery. Revisional surgery due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy was required in 5 eyes.\nThe translocation of a full-thickness graft usually results in a vascularized and functioning graft in patients with geographic atrophy, although is associated with a high risk of complications and visual loss.

Fifty patients who underwent at least 6 months before a reconstruction using a free vascularized radial forearm flap were asked to fill out two questionnaires regarding cosmetics and sensibility and forearm disabilities. Furthermore, a function test including movement extensions (flexion-extension, ulnar-radial deviation and pronation-supination), strength (pinch and grip) and temperature (digiti I and V) of the donor and non-donor site were measured and compared. Thirty-five percent of the patients reported no complaints regarding cosmetics and sensibility and 75% mentioned no forearm disabilities. There was no difference in movement extensions, temperature and grip strength between donor and non-donor sites. The difference in pinch strength appeared to be significant (p < 0.001). The total score of the questionnaire on forearm disabilities correlated significantly with extension, pronation and grip strength of the donor arm.

{"title": "[Ultrasound in gastroenterology. Biliopancreatic system].", "abstract": "GALLBLADDER: Ultrasound has become widely accepted for the diagnosis of gallbladder disease. Sensitivity for cholecystolithiasis is approximately 100%. Cholezystitis including its acute and chronic complications is also a domain of ultrasound techniques. An obstruction of the bile ducts and its localization are easily recognized. Clarifying the etiology is yet another question far more difficult to answer. Ultrasound contrast agents have proven to be useful for clarification of biliary tumors. Gallbladder polyps are well detectable. Adenomas of > 1 cm are an indication for surgery, the detection of a vessel at the polyps' base by color duplex ultrasound is helpful. Gallbladder carcinomas as a disease of the older age with few early symptoms are usually detected at a late stage when the liver is already infiltrated. BILE DUCT SYSTEM: Even with the most modern equipment the sensitivity for choledocholithiasis is still largely dependent on the examiner's expertise und differs between 25% and 100%. Endosonography is more efficient (94-100%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis shows bile duct dilation like \"a string of pearls\" and typical perihepatic lymph node enlargement. Differentiation from early cholangiocarcinoma is difficult. PANCREAS: In diagnostic imaging of the pancreas ultrasound stands at the beginning of a diagnostic cascade. In contrast to other competing examinations it can be repeated at any time and without X-ray exposure. The informative value, though, is largely dependent on the examiner's expertise. Usually, a CT scan is additionally performed when ultrasound examination is incomplete or limited through examination condition or if doubts on diagnostic accuracy arise. In cases of acute pancreatitis, especially the assessment and follow-up of complications (exudation, necrosis, pseudocysts, vascular complications, and obstructive effects) are precious.

What was not anticipated, however, was that the tumors treated with LF would have a substantially reduced vascular content. This intriguing result was one of the first indications that MKK signaling plays an important role in promoting tumor vascularization in vivo.

{"title": "Involvement of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors in polycystic kidney disease.", "abstract": "In polycystic kidney disease (PKD), erythropoietin (EPO) production and interstitial vascularization are increased compared with other kidney diseases. EPO and several angiogenic factors are controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which are composed of a constitutive beta-subunit and two alternative alpha-subunits (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha). We hypothesized that cyst expansion may result in pericystic hypoxia and consecutive up-regulation of HIF and thus examined the expression of HIF-alpha and HIF target genes in human PKD and in a rodent PKD model. HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha were found to be up-regulated in cyst epithelium and cells of cyst walls, respectively. The distinct expression pattern of the HIF-alpha isoforms closely resembles the respective pattern in normal kidneys under systemic hypoxia. Pimonidazole staining, a marker for tissue hypoxia, confirmed the existence of regional hypoxia in polycystic kidneys. Immunohistochemistry for selected target genes implicated a role for HIF-1alpha in vascular endothelial growth factor and Glut-1 activation and HIF-2alpha in endoglin and EPO stimulation. Polycystin-deficient cells showed physiological, oxygen-dependent HIF-alpha modulation, excluding a direct influence of polycystin deficiency on HIF-alpha regulation. In conclusion, HIF accumulation in human and rat PKD seems to be responsible for increased EPO production and pericystic hypervascularity and may have an impact on progression of PKD.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2007-02-27", "authors": ["Wanja MichaelBernhardt", "Michael SeanWiesener", "AlexanderWeidemann", "RolandSchmitt", "WilkoWeichert", "PhilippLechler", "ValentinaCampean", "Albert Chee MengOng", "CarstenWillam", "NorbertGretz", "Kai-UweEckardt"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2007.060455"}
{"title": "The role of the electron transport SDHC gene on lifespan and cancer.", "abstract": "Much attention has been focused on the hypothesis that oxidative damage plays in cellular and organismal aging. It is known that oxygen is initially converted to superoxide anion (O2-), one of reactive oxygen species (ROS), by electron leaked from mainly complex III in the electron transport system present in mitochondria, where it is the major endogenous source of ROS. We have shown that a mutation in a subunit, cytochrome b large subunit (SDHC), of complex II, also results in increasing O2- production and therefore lead to apoptosis and precocious aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recently, individuals with an inherited propensity for vascularized head and neck tumors (i.e., paragangliomas) have been demonstrated to contain one of several mutations in complex II. To further explore the role of oxidative stress from mitochondria on apoptosis and cancer, we established a transgenic cell line with a point mutation at the ubiquinone binding region in the SDHC gene. As expected, this mutation increased O2- production from complex II and led to excess apoptosis. Moreover, a significant fraction of the surviving cells from the apoptosis were transformed, as evidenced by increased tumor formation after injection into mice. Oxidative stress results in the damage to the cellular components including mitochondria and, therefore leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress must cause mutations in DNA and leads to cancer. It is suggested that oxidative stress from mitochondria play an important role of both apoptosis, which leads to precocious aging, and cancer.", "journal": "Mitochondrion", "date": "2007-02-27", "authors": ["NaoakiIshii", "TakamasaIshii", "Philip SHartman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mito.2006.11.012"}

This study examined our experience with ADM in the reconstruction of contaminated abdominal wall defects.\nPatients undergoing abdominal wall reconstructions in the face of contamination with ADM between May 2002 and December 2005 underwent retrospective chart review. Demographics, indications for ADM placement, plane of implantation, complications, and follow-up data were evaluated.\nSixty-seven patients were identified. The indications for ADM placement included incarcerated hernias, infected mesh, fistulae, early/delayed abdominal wall reconstruction after intra-abdominal catastrophe or trauma, dehiscence/evisceration, and spillage of enteric contents. The ADM was positioned either above the fascia or beneath the fascia or was sutured directly to the fascial edges.

Sixteen of these patients(n = 16) underwent surgery for the removal of the haemangiomas. All the removed tissues were transferred in experimental laboratories for the staining of microanatomical details, somatic and visceral nerve fibres, adrenergic and catecholaminergic nerve fibres. Beta-adrenergic receptors were died with a fluorescent method. All results were submitted to the quantitative analysis of images and statistical evaluation of the data.\nThe morphological results revealed numerous micro-anatomical characteristics of the haemangiomatous vessels. The somatic and visceral nerve fibres were poor and located exclusively in the adventitial layer. There was a marked decrease of adrenergic nerve fibres in the haemangiomatous vessels. The fluorescence of catecholaminergic nerve fibres and the overall area of fluorescent structures were also decreased in haemangiomatous vessels. Beta adrenergic receptors are strongly decreased in haemangiomatous vessels. The morphometrical analysis of images and statistical evaluation of the data confirmed all our experimental results.\nThe catecholaminergic innervation of the human haemangiomatous vessels comprises nerve fibres containing the main catecholaminergic neurotransmitters that are sympathetic in nature.

Defect cavities were lined with a preformed vascularized membrane (induced by temporarily inserting a cement spacer for 6 weeks prior to bone construct implantation), which served as a mold keeping the engineered bone granules in place. Radiographic, histological, and computed tomographic tests performed 6 months later showed that the osteogenic abilities of the engineered construct and autograft were significantly greater than those of coral scaffold alone. No significant differences were found between the amount of newly formed bone in defects filled with coral/MSCs and those filled with autograft, yet radiological scores differed significantly between the two groups (21% and 100% healed cortices, respectively). The present study on a clinically relevant animal model provides the first evidence that standardized particulate bone constructs can be used to repair large bone defects and that their osteogenic ability approaches that of bone autograft, the bone repair benchmark.

Skeletal abnormalities such as short stature or bowing/pseudarthrosis of the tibia are relatively common. To investigate the role of the neurofibromin in skeletal development, we crossed Nf1flox mice with Prx1Cre mice to inactivate Nf1 in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the developing limbs. Similar to NF1 affected individuals, Nf1(Prx1) mice show bowing of the tibia and diminished growth. Tibial bowing is caused by decreased stability of the cortical bone due to a high degree of porosity, decreased stiffness and reduction in the mineral content as well as hyperosteoidosis. Accordingly, osteoblasts show an increase in proliferation and a decreased ability to differentiate and mineralize in vitro. The reduction in growth is due to lower proliferation rates and a differentiation defect of chondrocytes. Abnormal vascularization of skeletal tissues is likely to contribute to this pathology as it exerts a negative effect on cortical bone stability. Furthermore, Nf1 has an important role in the development of joints, as shown by fusion of the hip joints and other joint abnormalities, which are not observed in neurofibromatosis type I.

Results showed that C-bFGF promoted vascularization at the implanted sites more effectively than V-bFGF. Histological analysis showed more cells migrated into collagen scaffolds incorporated with C-bFGF than those with V-bFGF. These data suggested that the higher collagen-binding ability the CBD-bFGF possessed, the more significant vascularization, and cellularization were observed.

{"title": "The neuro-neoplastic synapse: does it exist?", "abstract": "Since the pioneering work of Judah Folkman and colleagues in the 1970s on tumor neoangiogenesis, we learned more and more about the heterogeneity of the cellular, subcellular and stromal architecture within a tumor mass. The research on neoangiogenesis has lead to novel molecular entities (vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-Beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8), which can be targeted within the framework of tumor neoangiogenesis inhibition. Accepting the paradigm of anti-angiogenic therapy, a new class of drugs could be developed some of which already obtained clinical approval. As blood vessels and nerves often follow parallel trajectories within a tumor tissue, it was consequent to argue that tumor cells for their growth advantage and survival and metastases formation use common cues that induce vascularization and innervation. Autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions between a resident tumor cell type with neurocrine cell types and their signaling molecules can be regarded as a neuro-neoplastic synapse. That cross-talk molecules are equally interesting molecules as selectable anti-tumor targets as it turned out to be in the past for tumor angiogenesis factors.

{"title": "Neoneurogenesis and the neuro-neoplastic synapse.", "abstract": "A tumor is not an isolated entity within an organism, but tissue that strongly interacts with its environment. This interaction is however not restricted to direct cell-to-cell interactions, but generally comprises the susceptibility of tumor cells for chemokines and cytokines, as well as neurotransmitters and hormones by the expression of the according receptors. These signal substances have influences on tumor cell functions such as proliferation and migration. The other way round, tumor cells themselves release a broad range of these signal substances, which influence the cells of the environment. One of the first and most important interactions in this respect is the angiogenesis, which was discovered about 30 years ago. Tumor cells release angiogenic factors, i.e. the vascular endothelial growth factor as well as angiogenic chemokines among others. These factors initiate the vascularization of the tumor. Recently, a similar process was found for the development of lymphatic vessels in tumors. We herein seize these observations and combine them with arguments provided in the previous chapter, which leads us to the hypothesis that tumor cells may also be able to stimulate their own innervation; a process that we have termed neoneurogenesis.", "journal": "Progress in experimental tumor research", "date": "2007-02-23", "authors": ["DanielPalm", "FrankEntschladen"], "doi": "10.1159/000100049"}
{"title": "Studies on MIP-2 and CXCR2 expression in a mouse model of extrahepatic colorectal metastasis.", "abstract": "The CXC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 has been shown to promote outgrowth of colorectal liver metastasis by enhancing angiogenesis and tumor cell migration. However, the effect of MIP-2 on extrahepatic metastasis is not known yet. With a use of a murine model, we therefore studied cell proliferation and microvascularization of extrahepatic CT26.WT-GFP colorectal tumors after exposure to MIP-2.\nGreen fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected CT26.WT colorectal cancer cells were implanted in dorsal skinfold chambers of syngeneic BALB/c mice. After 5 days, the tumors were locally exposed to 100 nM MIP-2. Cell proliferation as well as tumor microvascularization and growth were studied during a further 9-day period using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. Tumors exposed to PBS served as controls.\nMIP-2 induced a marked CXCR2 expression and promoted a distinct tumor cell proliferation. This was associated with a significant increase of tumor size compared to PBS-treated controls. Of interest, MIP-2 did not affect dilation and permeability of the tumor microvessels, which would be indicators for an enhanced VEGF action. Accordingly, the angiogenic response, e.g. the outgrowth of new microvessels, was not affected, and the density of the established tumor microvascular network was even found decreased after MIP-2 exposure when compared to PBS controls.\nWith the use of a murine tumor model, we demonstrate that MIP-2 accelerates growth of experimentally established extrahepatic colorectal metastases by inducing tumor cell proliferation rather than promoting vascularization.", "journal": "European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology", "date": "2007-02-23", "authors": ["OKollmar", "BJunker", "KRupertus", "M DMenger", "M KSchilling"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejso.2007.01.012"}
{"title": "Term Amniotic membrane is a high throughput source for multipotent Mesenchymal Stem Cells with the ability to differentiate into endothelial cells in vitro.", "abstract": "Term Amniotic membrane (AM) is a very attractive source of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) due to the fact that this fetal tissue is usually discarded without ethical conflicts, leading to high efficiency in MSC recovery with no intrusive procedures. Here we confirmed that term AM, as previously reported in the literature, is an abundant source of hMSCs; in particular we further investigated the AM differentiation potential by assessing whether these cells may also be committed to the angiogenic fate. In agreement with the recommendation of the International Society for Cellular Therapy, the mesenchymal cells herein investigated were named Amniotic Membrane-human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (AM-hMSC).\nThe recovery of hMSCs and their in vitro expansion potential were greater in amniotic membrane than in bone marrow stroma. At flow cytometry analysis AM-hMSCs showed an immunophenotypical profile, i.e., positive for CD105, CD73, CD29, CD44, CD166 and negative for CD14, CD34, CD45, consistent with that reported for bone marrow-derived MSCs. In addition, amniotic membrane-isolated cells underwent in vitro osteogenic (von Kossa stain), adipogenic (Oil Red-O stain), chondrogenic (collagen type II immunohistochemichal detection) and myogenic (RT-PCR MyoD and Myogenin expression as well as desmin immunohistochemical detection) differentiation. In angiogenic experiments, a spontaneous differentiation into endothelial cells was detected by in vitro matrigel assay and this behaviour has been enhanced through Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) induction. According to these findings, VEGF receptor 1 and 2 (FLT-1 and KDR) were basally expressed in AM-hMSCs and the expression of endothelial-specific markers like FLT-1 KDR, ICAM-1 increased after exposure to VEGF together with the occurrence of CD34 and von Willebrand Factor positive cells.\nThe current study suggests that AM-hMSCs may emerge as a remarkable tool for the cell therapy of multiple diseased tissues. AM-hMSCs may potentially assist both bone and cartilage repair, nevertheless, due to their angiogenic potential, they may also pave the way for novel approaches in the development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts which are useful when vascularization of ischemic tissues is required.", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "date": "2007-02-23", "authors": ["FrancescoAlviano", "ValentinaFossati", "CosettaMarchionni", "MarioArpinati", "LauraBonsi", "MicheleFranchina", "GiacomoLanzoni", "SilviaCantoni", "ClaudiaCavallini", "FrancescaBianchi", "Pier LuigiTazzari", "GianandreaPasquinelli", "LauraForoni", "CarloVentura", "AlbertoGrossi", "Gian PaoloBagnara"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-213X-7-11\n10.1126/science.276.5309.71\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-377\n10.1634/stemcells.21-1-105\n10.1634/stemcells.22-4-625\n10.1634/stemcells.22-5-649\n10.1080/14653240600735933\n10.1002/jnr.20257\n10.1053/plac.1999.0482\n10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02285.x\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2003.10.004\n10.1076/0271-3683(200003)20:3;1-9;FT173\n10.1016/j.exphem.2004.04.001\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0098\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0058\n10.1016/j.ajog.2006.01.101\n10.1080/14653240500319234\n10.1038/ng1760\n10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.003\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.07.025\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000124476.32871.E3\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2003.09.007\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01986.x\n10.1634/stemcells.22-4-625\n10.1016/j.ajog.2003.07.011\n10.1016/j.exphem.2004.09.003\n10.1097/01.tp.0000173794.72151.88\n10.1055/s-2003-41353\n10.1097/00006534-200201000-00030\n10.1634/stemcells.22-4-617\n10.1016/j.molmed.2004.08.007\n10.1016/S0301-472X(00)00482-3\n10.1016/S1471-4914(01)02016-0\n10.1073/pnas.1834138100\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000073832.49290.B5\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm_317.x\n10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00537-3\n10.1074/jbc.M312025200\n10.1634/stemcells.19-5-408\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1787\n10.1089/scd.2006.15.349\n10.1093/carcin/bgh321\n10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00619-9"}

Limb reconstruction has traditionally involved allografting. The authors evaluated reconstruction of extremity long bone defects after tumor resection using fibula free flaps.\nA retrospective chart review (1991 to 2002) was performed of 25 consecutive patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who underwent reconstruction with free fibula flaps after limb-sparing resection of extremity sarcomas. Timing of reconstruction, complications, metastasis, survival, bone union, and functional outcome were analyzed. Functional assessment was based on the 1987 Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score/Enneking classification.\nTwenty-five patients (14 male patients and 11 female patients) were treated. Osteosarcoma (n = 8), Ewing's sarcoma (n = 8), and chondrosarcoma (n = 6) accounted for the majority of the cases. Reconstructed areas included tibia (n = 9), radius (n = 5), humerus (n = 6), femur (n = 4), and ulna (n = 1). All flaps survived (100 percent). One patient required emergent reexploration (4 percent), one suffered partial flap skin loss (4 percent), and three experienced postoperative infections (12 percent). In patients followed over 6 months, uncomplicated bony union was achieved in 11 of 14 patients (78 percent). After secondary procedures, bony union was ultimately achieved in 13 of 14 patients (93 percent), all of whom had good functional outcomes. Eight patients suffered local recurrences or metastases (32 percent); six died during the study period.\nThe microvascular free fibula flap has a lower infection rate than traditional allograft reconstruction. There is a high rate of bone union, and functional outcome is good.

{"title": "Does sustained epinephrine release trigger a hypoxia-neovascularization cascade?", "abstract": "Recent data regarding the long-term local administration of epinephrine to soft tissues for the purpose of inducing prolonged vasoconstriction have yielded promising results. These studies postulated that long-term release of epinephrine by a microsphere/drug delivery system caused continuous vasoconstriction and subsequent vascular augmentation. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that epinephrine induces a hypoxia-neovascularization cascade and plays a primary role in vascular proliferation within soft tissues.\nThirty male New Zealand White rabbits were randomly grouped as follows: group I, control (n = 10); group II, saline-loaded microsphere/drug delivery system injection (n = 10); and group III, epinephrine-loaded microsphere/drug delivery system injection (n = 10). A 2 x 1-cm rectangle was marked on the dorsal surface of the left ear of each rabbit. No solutions were injected in the control group, whereas 1 ml of saline-loaded and epinephrine-loaded microspheres was injected into groups II and III, respectively. A laser Doppler device was used to measure tissue blood volume and tissue blood flow.\nLaser Doppler monitoring in tissue blood flow yielded a distinct difference between the epinephrine-loaded microsphere-injected group and the other two groups (p < 0.05).\nThe ability of epinephrine-loaded microspheres to augment the vascular network in vivo is the result of sustained vasoconstriction with consequent tissue hypoxia and subsequent neovascularization. Data extracted from the present study, first, might be applied to improve hemostasis for operations typically plagued by serious intraoperative blood loss.

However, mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully understood. Recent work has demonstrated that chronic behavioral stress results in higher levels of tissue catecholamines, greater tumor burden, and a more invasive pattern of ovarian cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse model. These effects are mediated primarily through the beta(2) adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) activation of the tumor cell cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Additionally, tumors in stressed animals have increased vascularization and enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9.

We observed a 70% reduction in tumor volume in NC1(XIX)-treated mice compared with the corresponding controls. Histologic examination of the tumors showed a strong decrease in tumor vascularization in treated mice. In vitro, NC1(XIX) inhibited the migrating capacity of tumor cells and their capacity to invade Matrigel. It also inhibited the capacity of human microvascular endothelial cells to form pseudotubes in Matrigel. This effect was accompanied by a strong inhibition of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (matrix metalloproteinase-14) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Collectively, our data indicate that the NC1 domain of type XIX collagen exerts antitumor activity.

{"title": "Vasculogenic mimicry: current status and future prospects.", "abstract": "In 1999, Maniotis reported that blood vessels of highly aggressive uveal melanomas are formed by tumor cells instead of endothelial cells. He termed this novel concept in tumor vascularization vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Since then, VM has been seen in several malignant tumor types such as breast cancer, liver cancer, glioma, ovarian cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and bidirectional differentiated malignant tumors. Laser scanning confocal angiography, electron microscopy, and three-dimensional cell culture have confirmed the existence of VM. The molecular mechanisms that underlie VM are not fully clear, but metalloproteinases via their cleavage of laminin, VE-cadherin by promoting adherence of the VM channel wall to tumor cells, tumor cell dedifferentiation, and tumor microenvironment have been shown to play a role in VM. Zhang and co-workers have proposed a three-stage phenomenon among VM channels, mosaic blood vessels, and endothelium-dependent blood vessels, wherein all three patterns participate in tumor blood supply. Therapeutic strategies that target endothelial cells have no effect on tumor cells that engage in VM. VM-targeting strategies include suppressing tyrosine kinase activity and using a knockout EphA2 gene, downregulating VE-cadherin, using antibodies against human MMPs and the laminin 5gamma2 chain, and using anti-PI3K therapy.

{"title": "Angiogenesis and cancer prevention: a vision.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is necessary for solid tumor growth and dissemination. In addition to angiogenesis, it has become increasingly clear that inflammation is a key component in cancer insurgence that can promote tumor angiogenesis. We noted that angiogenesis is a common and key target of most chemopreventive molecules, where they most likely suppress the angiogenic switch in premalignant tumors, a concept we termed angioprevention. We have shown that various molecules, such as flavonoids, antioxidants, and retinoids, act in the tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the recruitment and/or activation of endothelial cells and phagocytes of the innate immunity. N-acetyl-cysteine, and the green tea flavonoid epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and the beer/ hops-derived chalcone Xanthohumol all prevent angiogenesis in the Matrigel sponge angiogenic assay in vivo and inhibit the growth of the highly angiogenic Kaposi's sarcoma tumor cells (KS-Imm) in nude mice. The synthetic retinoid 4-hydroxyfenretinide (4HPR) also shows anti-angiogenic effects. We analyzed the regulation of gene expression they exert in primary human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture with functional genomics. Expression profiles obtained through Affymetrix GeneChip arrays identified overlapping sets of genes regulated by anti-oxidants. In contrast, the ROS-producing 4HPR induced members of the TGFbeta-ligand superfamily, which, at least in part, explains its anti-angiogenic activity. NAC and the flavonoids all suppressed the IkB/NF-kappaB signaling pathway even in the presence of NF-kappaB stimulation by TNFalpha, and showed reduced expression of many NF-kappaB target genes. A selective apoptotic effect on transformed cells, but not on endothelial cells, of the anti-oxidants may be related to the reduced expression of the NF-kappaB-dependent survival factors Bcl2 and Birc5/surviving, which are selectively overexpressed in transformed cells by these factors. The repression of the NF-kappaB pathway suggests anti-inflammatory effects for the antioxidant compounds that may also represent an indirect role in angiogenesis inhibition. The green tea flavonoid EGCG does target inflammatory cells, mostly neutrophils, and inhibits inflammation-associated angiogenesis. The other angiopreventive molecules are turning out to be effective modulators of phagocyte recruitment and activation, further linking inflammation and vascularization to tumor onset and progression and providing a key target for cancer prevention.", "journal": "Recent results in cancer research.

Recent investigations have brought up a number of biological features in this family of neoplasms that could represent targets for anticancer treatment. NETs seem to have an extraordinary tumor vascularization with high expression of proangiogenic molecules such as the vascular endothelial growth factor along with overexpression of certain tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR) and their downstream signaling pathway components (PI3K-AKT-mTOR). The rationale of an antiangiogenic approach in the treatment of NETs and the use of other pharmacological strategies such as EGFR, IGFR and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors are discussed. Additionally, the emerging results of recent clinical trials with these targeted drugs are presented.", "journal": "Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology", "date": "2007-02-16", "authors": ["IDur\u00e1n", "RSalazar", "OCasanovas", "VArrazubi", "EVilar", "L LSiu", "JYao", "JTabernero"], "doi": "10.1093/annonc/mdm009"}
{"title": "Physiology-based face recognition in the thermal infrared spectrum.", "abstract": "The current dominant approaches to face recognition rely on facial characteristics that are on or over the skin. Some of these characteristics have low permanency can be altered, and their phenomenology varies significantly with environmental factors (e.g., lighting). Many methodologies have been developed to address these problems to various degrees. However, the current framework of face recognition research has a potential weakness due to its very nature. We present a novel framework for face recognition based on physiological information. The motivation behind this effort is to capitalize on the permanency of innate characteristics that are under the skin. To establish feasibility, we propose a specific methodology to capture facial physiological patterns using the bioheat information contained in thermal imagery. First, the algorithm delineates the human face from the background using the Bayesian framework. Then, it localizes the superficial blood vessel network using image morphology. The extracted vascular network produces contour shapes that are characteristic to each individual. The branching points of the skeletonized vascular network are referred to as Thermal Minutia Points (TMPs) and constitute the feature database. To render the method robust to facial pose variations, we collect for each subject to be stored in the database five different pose images (center, midleft profile, left profile, midright profile, and right profile). During the classification stage, the algorithm first estimates the pose of the test image. Then, it matches the local and global TMP structures extracted from the test image with those of the corresponding pose images in the database. We have conducted experiments on a multipose database of thermal facial images collected in our laboratory, as well as on the time-gap database of the University of Notre Dame. The good experimental results show that the proposed methodology has merit, especially with respect to the problem of low permanence over time. More importantly, the results demonstrate the feasibility of the physiological framework in face recognition and open the way for further methodological and experimental research in the area.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "date": "2007-02-15", "authors": ["PradeepBuddharaju", "Ioannis TPavlidis", "PanagiotisTsiamyrtzis", "MikeBazakos"], "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1007"}

CCR1 is a receptor for various proinflammatory chemokines and CCR1 blockade reduces renal allograft injury in rabbits. The purpose of the study was to characterize CCR1-positive cells in human renal allografts.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded allograft nephrectomies (n = 9) and non-involved parts of tumour nephrectomies (n = 10) were studied. Immunohistochemistry for CCR1, CD3 and CD68 was performed on consecutive sections. Double immunofluorescence for CCR1 and CD3, CD20, CD68, DC-SIGN and S100 was used on selected cases. Expression of CCR1 mRNA and the ligands CCL3 and CCL5 was studied in renal allograft biopsies with acute rejection (n = 10), with chronic allograft nephropathy (n = 8) and controls (n = 8).\nCCR1 protein was expressed by circulating cells in glomerular and peritubular capillaries, colocalizing with CD68. In renal allografts CCR1-positive cells were present within glomerular tufts, but only scattered CCR1-positive cells were found in tubulointerstitial infiltrates. CCR1 did not colocalize with the majority of CD68-positive cells in the interstitium. The small number of CCR1-positive interstitial cells were identified as CD20- or DC-SIGN-positive by double immunofluorescence. CCR1 mRNA was significantly increased in renal biopsies with acute allograft rejection (P < 0.001), and with chronic allograft nephropathy (P < 0.05), it correlated with the expression of CCL3 and CCL5, and with serum-creatinine.\nCCR1 mRNA expression was associated with renal function in allografts. CCR1 protein expression was restricted to monocytes, CD20-positive B cells and DC-SIGN-positive dendritic cells. Thus most interstitial macrophages were CCR1 negative, which may relate to down-regulation after migration into the interstitium in human renal allografts.", "journal": "Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association", "date": "2007-02-15", "authors": ["VerenaMayer", "Kelly LHudkins", "FlorianHeller", "HolgerSchmid", "MatthiasKretzler", "UlrikeBrandt", "Hans-JoachimAnders", "HeinzRegele", "Peter JNelson", "Charles EAlpers", "DetlefSchl\u00f6ndorff", "StephanSegerer"], "doi": "10.1093/ndt/gfm007"}

This is correlated with an increased expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these tumors, which is in part caused by elevated expression of the HIF-1 hypoxia inducible transcription factors. We created malignant astrocytes with genetic deletions of the VHL gene and implanted them in subcutaneous and intracranial sites; these sites are respectively vessel poor and vessel-rich tissues. When grown in a vessel poor site, VEGF expression in VHL null cells was important for both vascularization and tumor growth. However, when the same cells are grown in the vessel-rich intracranial environment, loss of VEGF expression reduces vascularization, but does not affect tumor growth. This indicates that antiangiogenic therapies for tumors that express high levels of angiogenic factors such as VEGF may vary in their efficacy, with potentially lowered effectiveness in sites, such as the brain, that are inherently vessel rich.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2007-02-14", "authors": ["BBlouw", "V HHaase", "HSong", "GBergers", "R SJohnson"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1210249"}

{"title": "The Notch ligand Delta-like 4 negatively regulates endothelial tip cell formation and vessel branching.", "abstract": "Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a transmembrane ligand for Notch receptors that is expressed in arterial blood vessels and sprouting endothelial cells. Here we show that Dll4 regulates vessel branching during development by inhibiting endothelial tip cell formation. Heterozygous deletion of dll4 or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling using gamma-secretase inhibitor revealed a striking vascular phenotype, with greatly increased numbers of filopodia-extending endothelial tip cells and increased expression of tip cell marker genes compared with controls. Filopodia extension in dll4(+/-) retinal vessels required the vascular growth factor VEGF and was inhibited when VEGF signaling was blocked. Although VEGF expression was not significantly altered in dll4(+/-) retinas, dll4(+/-) vessels showed increased expression of VEGF receptor 2 and decreased expression of VEGF receptor 1 compared with wild-type, suggesting they could be more responsive to VEGF stimulation. In addition, expression of dll4 in wild-type tip cells was itself decreased when VEGF signaling was blocked, indicating that dll4 may act downstream of VEGF as a \"brake\" on VEGF-mediated angiogenic sprouting. Taken together, these data reveal Dll4 as a negative regulator of vascular sprouting and vessel branching that is required for normal vascular network formation during development.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2007-02-14", "authors": ["StevenSuchting", "CatarinaFreitas", "Ferdinandle Noble", "RuiBenedito", "ChristianeBr\u00e9ant", "AntonioDuarte", "AnneEichmann"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0611177104"}
{"title": "Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) is induced by VEGF as a negative regulator of angiogenic sprouting.", "abstract": "Genetic deletion studies have shown that haploinsufficiency of Delta-like ligand (Dll) 4, a transmembrane ligand for the Notch family of receptors, results in major vascular defects and embryonic lethality. To better define the role of Dll4 during vascular growth and differentiation, we selected the postnatal retina as a model because its vasculature develops shortly after birth in a highly stereotypic manner, during which time it is accessible to experimental manipulation. We report that Dll4 expression is dynamically regulated by VEGF in the retinal vasculature, where it is most prominently expressed at the leading front of actively growing vessels. Deletion of a single Dll4 allele or pharmacologic inhibition of Dll4/Notch signaling by intraocular administration of either soluble Dll4-Fc or a blocking antibody against Dll4 all produced the same set of characteristic abnormalities in the developing retinal vasculature, most notably enhanced angiogenic sprouting and increased endothelial cell proliferation, resulting in the formation of a denser and more highly interconnected superficial capillary plexus. In a model of ischemic retinopathy, Dll4 blockade also enhanced angiogenic sprouting and regrowth of lost retinal vessels while suppressing ectopic pathological neovascularization. Our data demonstrate that Dll4 is induced by VEGF as a negative feedback regulator and acts to prevent overexuberant angiogenic sprouting, promoting the timely formation of a well differentiated vascular network.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2007-02-14", "authors": ["I BLobov", "R ARenard", "NPapadopoulos", "N WGale", "GThurston", "G DYancopoulos", "S JWiegand"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0611206104"}

However, most models produced thus far have drawbacks such as high rates of artificial tumor dissemination and complexity of the implantation technique. To circumvent these issues, we selected an appropriate HCC cell line coupled with a simple modality to prevent unintended tumor cell dissemination.\nKDH-8 cells were inoculated into the rat liver. To prevent tumor cell leakage, a human fibrinogen/thrombin-coated collagen patch was attached on the site after withdrawal of the needle. In some animals, ligation of the hepatic artery was performed.\nEarly after injection, all rats (n = 60) developed a solitary nodule. Successful inoculation was observed in all animals with a leakage (dissemination) rate of 0%. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a well-demarcated low density mass accompanied with a central necrosis that mimicked a typical CT image of human HCC. Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated a vascularized property of the tumor. Tumor volumes increased with time, reaching 3299.5 +/- 290.0 mm3 at day 28 after inoculation. Thus the formed KDH-8 hepatoma was pathologically classified into a poorly differentiated HCC demarcated with surrounding connective tissue. After hepatic arterial ligation, tumor growth was impeded with an inhibition of 59.1 and 70.4% (day 21 and 28, respectively).\nThe current orthotopic hepatoma model enables a controlled and reproducible tumorigenicity and displays properties and histopathology resembling human HCC.

This study examined a single institution's experience with the pedicled latissimus dorsi flap in reconstructing large shoulder defects after oncologic resection.\nUsing a prospectively maintained database, 33 consecutive patients were reviewed who had undergone a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap to reconstruct oncologic shoulder defects between 1994 and 2004. Wide excision or radical en-bloc resection of shoulder tissues was performed with defects often extending intra-articularly and to the level of the mid-arm.

Outcome variables included major and minor complications, patient survival, and limb viability.\nAdjuvant therapy included chemotherapy in 18 patients, radiation therapy in 12 patients, and brachytherapy in 2 patients. Defects averaged 280.1 cm2 (range 18-1,225 cm2). Mean skin paddle surface area was 118.9 cm2 (range 21-350 cm2). There were 28 myocutaneous flaps and 5 muscle flaps.

Estradiol treatment for 2 and 4 weeks decreased the total tissue immunoreactive level of TSP-1 as well as the endothelial cell-specific immunoreactive level of this protein in the anterior pituitary. The steroid treatment also decreased the protein levels of TSP-1 in anterior pituitary tissues and in purified pituitary endothelial cells in primary cultures. Determination of the effects of TSP-1 on proliferation and migration of pituitary-derived endothelial cells in primary cultures elucidated an inhibitory action of TSP-1 on these vascular cell functions. These results suggest that locally produced TSP-1 may regulate estrogen angiogenic action on the pituitary.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2007-02-07", "authors": ["Abby JSarkar", "KirtiChaturvedi", "Cui PingChen", "Dipak KSarkar"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.1.06925"}
{"title": "Hypoxia and its downstream targets in DMBA induced mammary carcinoma: protective role of Semecarpus anacardium nut extract.", "abstract": "Tumors are usually exposed to a hypoxic microenvironment due to their irregular growth and abnormal vascular supply. Under hypoxia, gene regulation (selective activation and inactivation of genes) plays an important role in maintenance of tumor. Multiple hypoxic and angiogenic growth factors are expressed for tumor cell survival. In search of novel anticancer drug, Semecarpus anacardium nut extract (SA) was tried against breast cancer. Mammary carcinoma was induced in vivo by 7,12-dimethyl benz(a) anthracene (DMBA) (25mg/kg b.w., p.o.). Tumor development and vascular structures were accelerated by DMBA. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1) was coexpressed with its downstream genes in mammary tissue. Cancer rats were then treated with S. anacardium nut extract (SA) (250mg/kg b.w., p.o.). Delay in the tumor growth was paralleled with a drastic reduction in vascularization by SA treatment. Activities of glycolytic enzymes were normalized with decreased expression of glucose transporter-1 and carbonic anhydrase IX by drug treatment. Inhibition of HIF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase by SA may in part explain its antiangiogenic action. SA also inhibits endothelial cell proliferation by blocking the overexpressed survival cytokines. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that at least some part of the antitumor activity of SA is due to the suppression of hypoxic and angiogenic factors. The mechanism of this inhibition seems to be through an action of SA on expression of HIF-1 and its downstream targets.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2007-02-07", "authors": ["PanneerselvamMathivadhani", "PalaniveluShanthi", "PanchanathamSachdanandam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2007.01.003"}

Herein, we investigated in vivo the inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response to this biomaterial after implantation. For this purpose, Ostim was implanted into the dorsal skinfold chambers of Syrian golden hamsters. The hydroxyapatite ceramic Cerabone and isogeneic transplanted cancellous bone served as controls. Angiogenesis, microhemodynamics, microvascular permeability, and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction of the host tissue were analyzed over 2 weeks using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Ostim exhibited good biocompatibility comparable to that of Cerabone and cancellous bone, as indicated by a lack of venular leukocyte activation after implantation. Cancellous bone induced a more pronounced angiogenic response and an increased microvessel density when compared with the synthetic bone substitutes. In contrast to Cerabone, however, Ostim showed a guided neovascularization directed toward areas of degradation. Histology confirmed the ingrowth of proliferating vascularized tissue into the hydroxyapatite paste at sites of degradation, while the hydroxyapatite ceramic was not pierced by new microvessels. Thus, Ostim represents an injectable synthetic bone substitute, which may optimize the conditions for the formation of new bone at sites of bone defects by supporting a guided vascularization during biodegradation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Bone-tissue-bone repairs for scapholunate dissociation.", "abstract": "Scapholunate dissociation is a commonly seen and treated form of carpal instability. Several surgical options have been used for the repair of scapholunate instability over the past 50 years. These have included benign neglect, reduction and percutaneous pinning, primary repair, partial fusions, tendon weaves, and combinations of these. Recent advancements in scapholunate repair and anatomy have been aimed at a more physiologic repair. Composite replacement of the entire scapholunate interval, similar to other tendon repairs seen in orthopedic surgery, has become popular. Bone-tissue-bone (BTB) autograft replacement from the foot has been used but the problems of a secondary surgical site have resulted in other graft site selections. Currently more commonly used grafts are bone-retinaculum-bone, third or second metacarpal-carpal bone, or hamate-capitate grafts, all performed with or without screw augmentation. Vascularized autograft replacement on pedicled grafts from the hand is being explored. This review discusses the surgeons' indications and technical details of the surgery. The lack of long-term outcome measurements for these BTB surgeries makes it difficult for the hand surgeon to determine the appropriate use of these treatment modalities, but early reports have indicated that the BTB graft will be an important part of scapholunate dissociation treatment.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2007-02-06", "authors": ["Edward JHarvey", "Richard ABerger", "A LeeOsterman", "Diego LFernandez", "Arnold-PeterWeiss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.11.011"}
{"title": "The tibial second toe vascularized neurocutaneous free flap for major digital nerve defects.", "abstract": "Most digital nerve defects can be reconstructed by means of nonvascularized nerve grafts or artificial tubes, for example. When the bed is poor, the defect is long, or there is a concomitant soft-tissue loss; however, a vascularized nerve graft may be a better option. Our purpose is to introduce a method of 1-stage reconstruction of complex neurocutaneous defects in the fingers and to report the results and clinical effectiveness at a minimum 1-year follow-up period.\nFrom 1997 to 2005 there were 6 consecutive patients who had a combined soft-tissue and digital nerve defect reconstructed by a vascularized neurocutaneous flap from the tibial (medial) side of the second toe. Three were acute and 3 were chronic cases. One flap was used for the ulnar side of the thumb, 2 for the radial aspect of the index finger, 1 for the radial of the small finger, and 2 for the ulnar side of the small finger. The nerve gap averaged 4.2 cm, and the flap size averaged 3.2 x 2.1 cm. The flaps were revascularized with standard microsurgical techniques to local vessels in the fingers. The nerves were sutured with epineural stitches. A split-thickness skin graft was used to close the donor site of the toe.\nAll flaps survived without complications. At the latest follow-up evaluation static two-point discrimination (s2PD) averaged 8 mm on the pulp. Three patients had normal sensation when tested with Semmes-Weinstein filaments. Subjective feeling was 78% of that of the normal side. Five patients rated their feeling as excellent on a subjective scale. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire score averaged 5.\nThe tibial neurocutaneous second toe free flap is suitable for reconstructing a missing nerve and soft-tissue defect in the finger.

{"title": "Outcome of allogeneic vascularized knee transplants.", "abstract": "Transplantation of vascularized knee joints is a novel approach in Composite Tissue Allotransplantation (CTA). In 1996 our group started a clinical knee transplantation project and six transplantations have been performed since. Key problems identified early were the monitoring of acute rejection and choice of an immunosuppressive regime. One graft was lost due to postoperative infection and one due to of noncompliance where the patient discontinued the immunosuppressant regime. In three cases late rejection lead to necrosis and graft dysfunction after 15, 16 and 24 months, respectively. Exit-strategies were arthrodesis in one patient and Above Knee Amputation in two cases. With retrospective analysis after initial five cases the treatment protocol was improved. The immunosuppressive drug regime was altered, femoral diaphysis and knee joint grafting was combined and a vascularized block of donor skin and subcutaneous tissue was harvested with the graft (sentinel skin graft). The sentinel skin graft enabled us to monitor acute rejection by clinical and histological examination and avoid late rejection by rapid treatment with high dose steroids. In summary, over a four-year period, one of six allogeneic vascularized knee transplants has survived, one was lost from a surgical site infection, one by noncompliance and three by late rejection. Analysis of our data leads us to suggest that knee transplantation should be limited to a combined injury consisting of extensive loss of cartilage and bone, deficient extensor mechanism and soft tissue and skin defects without any signs of infection.

Because ADMA has no blood vessels or cells, slower healing and incorporation are observed compared to a subepithelial connective tissue graft.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate histologically if gingival fibroblasts affect healing and incorporation of ADMA in dogs when used as a subepithelial allograft.\nGingival fibroblasts were established from explant culture from the connective tissue of keratinized gingiva collected from the maxilla of seven mongrel dogs.

{"title": "Tissue engineered prefabricated vascularized flaps.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND.: Microvascular free tissue transfer has become increasingly popular in the reconstruction of head and neck defects, but it also has its disadvantages. Tissue engineering allows the generation of neo-tissue for implantation, but these tissues are often avascular. We propose to combine tissue-engineering techniques together with flap prefabrication techniques to generate a prefabricated vascularized soft tissue flap.\nHuman dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) labeled with fluorescein diacetate were static seeded onto polylactic-co-glycolic acid-collagen (PLGA-c) mesh. Controls were plain PLGA-c mesh. The femoral artery and vein of the nude rat was ligated and used as a vascular carrier for the constructs. After 4 weeks of implantation, the constructs were assessed by gross morphology, routine histology, Masson trichrome, and cell viability determined by green fluorescence.\nAll the constructs maintained their initial shape and dimensions. Angiogenesis was evident in all the constructs with neo-capillary formation within the PLGA-c mesh seen. HDFs proliferated and filled the interyarn spaces of the PLGA-c mesh, while unseeded PLGA-c mesh remained relatively acellular. Cell tracer study indicated that the seeded HDFs remained viable and closely associated to remaining PLGA-c fibers. Collagen formation was more abundant in the constructs seeded with HDFs.\nPLGA-c, enveloped by a cell sheet composed of fibroblasts, can serve as a suitable scaffold for generation of a soft tissue flap.

{"title": "Prevention of wound complications following salvage laryngectomy using free vascularized tissue.", "abstract": "Total laryngectomy following radiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation therapy is associated with unacceptably high complication rates because of wound healing difficulties. With an ever increasing reliance on organ preservation protocols as primary treatment for advanced laryngeal cancer, the surgeon must develop techniques to minimize postoperative complications in salvage laryngectomy surgery. We have developed an approach using free tissue transfer in an effort to improve tissue vascularity, reinforce the pharyngeal suture line, and minimize complications in this difficult patient population. The purpose of this study was to outline our technique and determine the effectiveness of this new approach.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of a prospective cohort and compared it with a historical group (surgical patients of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-91-11 trial). Eligibility criteria for this study included patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy following failed attempts at organ preservation with either high-dose radiotherapy or concurrent chemo/radiation therapy regimen. Patients were excluded if the surgical defect required a skin paddle for pharyngeal closure. The prospective cohort consisted of 14 consecutive patients (10 males, 4 females; mean age, 58 years) who underwent free tissue reinforcement of the pharyngeal suture line following total laryngectomy. The historical comparison group consisted of 27 patients in the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm of the RTOG-91-11 trial who met the same eligibility criteria (26 males, 1 female; mean age, 57 years) but did not undergo free tissue transfer or other form of suture line reinforcement. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 12 months.\nThe overall pharyngocutaneous fistula rate was similar between groups-4/14 (29%) in the flap group, compared with 8/27 (30%) in the RTOG-91-11 group. There were no major wound complications in the flap group, compared with 4 (4/27, 14.8%) in the RTOG-91-11 group. There were no major fistulas in the flap group, compared with 3/27 (11.1%) in the RTOG-91-11 group. The rate of pharyngeal stricture requiring dilation was 6/14 (42%) in the flap group, compared with 7/27 (25.9%) in the RTOG-91-11 group. In our patients, the rate of tracheoesophageal speech was 14/14 (100%), and complete oral intake was achieved in 13/14 (93%) patients. Voice-Related Quality of Life Measure (V-RQOL) and Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN) scores suggest that speech and swallowing functions are reasonable following free flap reinforcement.\nFree vascularized tissue reinforcement of primary pharyngeal closure in salvage laryngectomy following failed organ preservation is effective in preventing major wound complications but did not reduce the overall fistula rate. Fistulas that developed following this technique were relatively small, did not result in exposed major vessels, and were effectively treated with outpatient wound care rather than readmission to the hospital or return to operating room.

{"title": "Angiogenic role of LYVE-1-positive macrophages in adipose tissue.", "abstract": "Here we report the discovery of a characteristic dense vascular network (DVN) in the tip portion of epididymal adipose tissue in adult mice. The DVN is formed by angiogenesis rather than by vasculogenesis, and has functional blood circulation. This DVN and its subsequent branching may provide a new functional route for adipogenesis. The recruitment, infiltration, and accumulation of bone marrow-derived LYVE-1(+) macrophages in the tip region are crucial for the formation of the DVN. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the VEGF-VEGFR2 system are responsible not only for the formation of the DVN, but also for the recruitment and infiltration of LYVE-1(+) macrophages into the epididymal adipose tissue tip region. SDF-1, but not the MCP-1-CCR2 system, is a critical factor in recruitment and ongoing retention of macrophages in this area. We also demonstrate that the tip region of epididymal adipose tissue is highly hypoxic, and thus provides a microenvironment conducive to the high expression and enhanced activities of VEGF, VEGFR2, MMPs, and SDF-1 in autocrine and paracrine manners, to create an ideal niche for the recruitment, retention, and angiogenic action of macrophages.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of this technique to bridge massive long-bone defects in a single stage.\nWith use of an ovine femoral model, an in situ periosteal sleeve was elevated circumferentially from healthy diaphyseal bone, which was osteotomized and transported over an intramedullary nail into a 2.54-cm (1-in) critical-sized diaphyseal defect. The defect-bridging and bone-regenerating capacity of the procedure were tested in five groups of seven animals each, which were defined by the absence (Group 1; control) or presence of the periosteal sleeve alone (Group 2), bone graft within the periosteal sleeve (Groups 3 and 5), as well as retention of adherent, vascularized cortical bone chips on the periosteal sleeve with or without bone graft (Groups 4 and 5). The efficacy of the procedure was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.\nAt sixteen weeks, osseous bridging of the defect was observed in all twenty-eight experimental sheep in which the periosteal sleeve was retained; the defect persisted in the remaining seven control sheep. Among the experimental groups 2 through 5, significant differences were observed in the density of the regenerated bone tissue; the two groups in which vascularized bone chips adhered to the inner surface of the periosteal sleeve (Groups 4 and 5) showed a higher mean bone density in the defect zone (p < 0.02) than did the other groups. In these two groups with the highest bone density, the addition of bone graft was associated with a significantly lower callus density than that observed without bone graft (p < 0.05). The volume of regenerate bone (p < 0.02) was significantly greater in the groups in which the periosteal sleeve was retained than it was in the control group. Among the experimental groups (groups 2 through 5), however, with the numbers studied, no significant differences in the volume of regenerate bone could be attributed to the inclusion of bone graft within the sleeve or to vascularized bone chips remaining adherent to the periosteum.\nThe novel surgical procedure was shown to be effective in bridging a critical-sized defect in an ovine femoral model. Vascularized bone chips adherent to the inner surface of the periosteal sleeve, without the addition of morselized cancellous bone graft within the sleeve, provide not only a comparable volume of regenerate bone and composite tissue (callus and bone) but also a superior density of regenerate bone compared with that after the addition of bone graft.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Forty-two genes were differentially expressed in GBM vessels compared to nonmalignant brain vessels. Validation of differentially expressed genes was performed by literature mining, Q-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Among the differentially expressed genes, only 64% were previously associated with vessels, angiogenesis, gliomas, and/or cancer. The upregulation of genes encoding secreted extracellular proteins IGFBP7 and SPARC was confirmed by Q-PCR in LCM-captured vessels. Whereas SPARC and IGFBP7 protein were absent in nonmalignant brain vessels, a distinct immunoreactivity patterns were observed in GBM sections whereby SPARC was strongly expressed in perivascular cells adjacent to GBM vessels while GBM endothelial cells were immunostained for IGFBP7. IGFBP7 immunoreactivity was also detected on the abluminal side of GBM vessels deposited between strands of vascular basal lamina. The study discerns unique molecular characteristics of GBM vessels compared with nonmalignant brain vessels that could potentially be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.", "journal": "Glia", "date": "2007-02-03", "authors": ["AllyPen", "Maria JMoreno", "JoelMartin", "Danica BStanimirovic"], "doi": "10.1002/glia.20481"}
{"title": "Reconstruction of Lower Extremity Fractures with Soft Tissue Defects.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of osseous and soft tissue defects after high-energy lower extremity trauma remains a challenge in trauma surgery. An initial planning of the reconstruction management is crucial in the therapeutic concept of these severe injuries. In Gustilo type II and IIIa fractures with minimal contamination a primary definite osseous stabilization by internal fixation along with primary soft tissue reconstruction is preferable. A variety of local, regional, and even free microvascular flaps are available for acute wound closure in such cases. Staged reconstruction with initial external fixation and vacuum-assisted wound closure is recommended for severe contaminated wounds and extended defects. Early secondary osseous reconstruction of larger osseous defects can be performed either by distraction lengthening technique or by a free vascularized bone graft. Early secondary soft tissue reconstruction necessitates a wide therapeutic repertoire in order to plan the optimal individual strategy. With a modern therapeutic strategy limb salvage with an adequate function after reconstruction of lower extremity fractures with soft tissue defects can be achieved in the majority of patients.", "journal": "European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society", "date": "2007-02-01", "authors": ["WolfgangDaecke", "IngoMarzi", "JohannesFrank"], "doi": "10.1007/s00068-007-7018-4"}
{"title": "Microvascular Reconstruction of the Upper Extremity.", "abstract": "Upper extremity composite tissue defects may result from trauma, tumor resection, infection, or congenital malformations. When reconstructing these defects the ultimate objectives are to provide adequate soft tissue protection of vital structures, and to provide optimal functional and esthetic outcomes. The development of clinical microsurgery has added a large number of treatment options to the trauma surgeon's armamentarium - primarily replantation of amputated tissues and transplantation of vascularized tissues from distant donor sites. Since the early 1970s, considerable refinement in microsurgical tools and techniques together with a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of microcirculatory tissue perfusion led to the introduction of a variety of thin, pliable and versatile-free flap designs.\nSources for this manuscript include a comprehensive literature search using the PUBMED and EMBASE databases along with relevant text books, Selected Readings in Plastic Surgery(\u00ae), and personal experiences of upper extremity reconstruction and microsurgery.\nIn this manuscript, we describe the primary microsurgical techniques used to reconstruct upper extremity tissue defects and discuss the basis for selecting one technique over another.\nWhere possible, the best results may be achieved by reattaching the amputated original tissues (microsurgical replantation). In noninfected, uncontaminated traumatic injuries resulting in composite soft tissue defects, Early free flap reconstruction of the upper extremities has important advantages over delayed (72 h-3 months) or late wound closure (3 months-2 years). In recent years, thin, pliable, and versatile fasciocutaneous flaps such as the anterolateral thigh (ALT) and lateral arm (LA) free flaps have been increasingly used with great success to reconstruct the upper extremity. The use of \"spare parts\" and functional reconstructions using osteomyocutaneous free flaps or toe to thumb transfers complete the armamentarium of the upper limb reconstructive microsurgeon.", "journal": "European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society", "date": "2007-02-01", "authors": ["IainWhitaker", "Ian CJosty", "Vera Cvan-Aalst", "Joseph CBanis", "John HBarker"], "doi": "10.1007/s00068-007-7022-8"}

Implants from silver-releasing and silver-free dressings were placed into dorsal skinfold chambers of BALB/c mice. A total of 30 animals (10 implants per group) were observed. Group 1 was treated with Contreet\u00ae (Coloplast, Holtedam, Denmark). Group 2 and Group 3 were primed with Biatain\u2122 (Coloplast, Holtedam, Denmark) and SeaSorb Soft\u00ae (Coloplast, Holtedam, Denmark). Visualization of angiogenesis and quantification of functional vessel density (FVD) was performed using intravital fluorescence microscopy (IFM). Functional vessel density served as the parameter for vascularization. Functional vessel density was measured on Day 3, 7, and 12 after implantation. Intravital fluorescence microscopy revealed constant development of a sufficient network of perfused microvessels surrounding the silver-based implants. Group 1 showed a stronger morphological alteration of microvessel network at the border zone at Day 3 and even more so at Day 7, compared to the silver-free groups. Reinforced dilatation, elongation, and torsion of capillaries with progressive growth of perfused preliminary stages of new blood vessels were observed for silver-based implants. Border zone FVD of silver-based implants at Day 3 (257.1 \u00b1 33.9 mm/mm2) was significantly increased compared to Group 2 (230.9 \u00b1 31.3) and Group 3 (210.2 \u00b1 35.7).

B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte and macrophage levels were determined by immunohistochemistry.\nFourteen of the 17 cytokines were expressed in breast carcinoma, whereas only nine cytokines could be detected in normal breast. Most cytokines were more abundant in breast carcinoma than in normal breast, with IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte CSF, IFN-gamma, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta being very abundant. IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, MIP-1beta and TNF-alpha, and to a lesser extent IL-1beta and IL-13 exhibited levels of expression that were inversely correlated to oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status.

However, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta were more abundant in high-grade tumours than in low-grade tumours. In addition, IL-8 and MIP-1beta were expressed to a greater degree in HER2-positive than in HER2-negative patients. The expression of most of the studied cytokines was correlated to levels of activator protein-1, which is known to regulate numerous cytokines. Overexpression of MCP-1 and MIP-1beta were linked to B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, whereas high levels of IL-8 were correlated with high macrophage content in tumour.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of the ephrin ligands and Eph receptors in vitro and in vivo in corneal angiogenesis in a mouse model. The Eph tyrosine kinase receptors and their ligands, ephrins, are expressed on the cell surface. The functions of Eph and ephrins have been shown to regulate axonal guidance, segmentation, cell migration, and angiogenesis. Understanding the roles of Eph and ephrin in corneal angiogenesis may provide a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of angiogenesis-related disorders. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that ephrinB1 and EphB1 were expressed in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced vascularized corneas. EphB1 was specifically colocalized with vascular endothelial marker CD31 surrounded by type IV collagen. EphrinB1 was expressed in corneal-resident keratocytes and neutrophils. Recombinant ephrinB1-Fc, which induces EphB receptor activation, enhanced bFGF-induced tube formation in an in vitro aortic ring assay and promoted bFGF-induced corneal angiogenesis in vivo in a corneal pocket assay. Synergistically enhanced and sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was noted in vascular endothelial cell lines after stimulation with ephrin B1 and bFGF combinations.

According to our and other previous studies, immune cells-derived cytokines, such as IL-1, may alone or in concert with estrogens, enhance the capability of ectopic endometrial cells to implant and develop into the host tissue. In the present study, immunohistochemical and dual immunofluorescence analyses showed that the functional signaling interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1RI) is expressed in endometriotic tissue, particularly in the glands, and identified endothelial cells, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes as cells having marked expression of IL-1RI. The highest concentrations of IL-1RI protein in endometriotic tissue, as evaluated using histological score (HSCORE) and measured by ELISA, were found in red endometriotic lesions as compared with typical black-blue or white lesions. Western blotting showed a significant increase in the levels of the 50 kDa band, whose apparent molecular weight corresponds to the soluble form of IL-1RI. RT-PCR analysis of IL-1 mRNA levels showed a pattern of expression comparable to that of the protein.

The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of the injected FGF-2/CH-LA/IO4-heparin hydrogel to induce vascularization and fibrous tissue formation. FGF-2/CH-LA/IO4-heparin hydrogels (100 microL of hydrogel consisting of 20 mg/mL of CH-LA, 2 mg/mL of IO4-heparin, and 50 microg/mL of FGF-2) were subcutaneously injected into the backs of wound healing-impaired diabetic (db/db) mice. Furthermore, the effect of percutaneous injection of FGF-2/CH-LA/IO4-heparin hydrogel at eight sites (25 microL/site) into ischemic left lower limbs of rats was examined from day 4 to at least day 28 postinjection. The injection of FGF-2/CH-LA/IO4-heparin hydrogels into the backs of db/db mice resulted in significant increases in blood vessel formation, significant vascularization, and fibrous tissue formation near the injection site. Injection of FGF-2/CH-LA/IO4-heparin hydrogel into ischemic left lower limbs of rats also significantly recovered and increased blood flow and blood oxygen in the calf and thigh.

This study tested whether the addition of BMP2/4 hybrid secretion signal to the FGF-2 gene and mutation of cys-70 and cys-88 to serine and asparagine, respectively, would increase the stability and secretion of active FGF-2 protein in mammalian cells using MLV-based vectors. Single or double mutations of cys-70 and cys-88 to ser-70 and asp-88, respectively, markedly increased the amounts of FGF-2 protein in conditioned media and cell lysates, which may be due to glycosylation, particularly at the mutated asp-88 residue. Addition of BMP2/4 secretion signal increased FGF-2 secretion, but also suppressed FGF-2 biosynthesis. The combination of BMP2/4 secretion signal and double cys-70 and cys-88 mutations increased the total amount of secreted FGF-2 protein >60-fold. The modifications did not alter its ability to stimulate cell proliferation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in marrow stromal cells or its ability to bind heparin in vitro, suggesting that the modified FGF-2 protein was functionally as effective as the unmodified FGF-2. An ex vivo application of rat skin fibroblasts (RSF) transduced with the modified FGF-2 vector in a subcutaneous implant model showed that rats with implants containing cells transduced with the modified FGF-2 vector increased serum FGF-2 level >15-fold, increased growth of the implant, and increased vascularization within the implant, compared to rats that received implants containing beta-galactosidase- or wild-type FGF-2-transduced control cells.

Two hundred eighty finger joints (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] I-V, interphalangeal [IP], and proximal interphalangeal [PIP] II-V) were investigated on power Doppler sonography to determine, in each patient, the finger joint with the strongest hypervascularization and to score the synovial vascularization. Further dynamic examination of the selected joint was performed on PIHI after i.v. administration of a second-generation sonographic contrast medium. Vascularization was quantified by calculating the area under the time-intensity curves. The changes in signal intensities before and after therapy were correlated with clinical examinations (disease activity score [DAS]).\nThe score of the joint with the strongest hypervascularization assessed by power Doppler sonography decreased significantly from 1.7 to 1.3 (p < 0.01); however, in six patients, no change was assessed after steroid therapy. In all patients, a significant reduction in PIHI signals was observed after therapy (p < 0.05).

The difference in exposure rate between coralline hydroxyapatite (4.9%) and porous polyethylene (8.1%) implants is primarily related to a higher reported complication rate of uncovered porous polyethylene implants, particularly in retinoblastoma patients. Other techniques associated with increased exposures include wrapping implants with bovine pericardium or polyglactin mesh. Evisceration and secondary procedures did not have statistically different complication rates compared with enucleation. There are more late exposures of porous polyethylene than coralline hydroxyapatite implants. Spontaneous healing of exposures occurred in 13% (19 of 145) of cases. Covering exposures with patch grafts underneath vascularized conjunctival flaps was the most successful method of surgical repair. Implant removal was necessary after 29% (42 of 145) of exposures.\nAlthough the published literature between 1989 and 2004 reports higher complication rates for uncovered porous implants and implants wrapped with bovine pericardium or polyglactin mesh, pooling data from different studies may mask very good or poor results obtained by individual surgeons.

{"title": "Combination of platelet-rich plasma with polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds for segmental bone defect repair.", "abstract": "Porous scaffold biomaterials may offer a clinical alternative to bone grafts; however, scaffolds alone are typically insufficient to heal large bone defects. Numerous studies have demonstrated that osteoinductive growth factor or gene delivery significantly improves bone repair. However, given the important role of vascularization during bone regeneration, it may also be beneficial to incorporate factors that promote vascular ingrowth into constructs. In this study, a strategy combining structural polycaprolactone-20% tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) composite scaffolds with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was tested. Following bilateral implantation of constructs into 8 mm rat nonunion femoral defects, 3D vascular and bone ingrowth were quantified at 3 and 12 weeks using contrast-enhanced microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) imaging. At week 3, PRP-treated femurs displayed 70.3% higher vascular volume fraction than control femurs. Interestingly, bone volume fraction (BVF) was significantly higher for the empty scaffold group at the early time point. At 12 weeks, BVF measurements between the two groups were statistically equivalent. However, a greater proportion of PRP-treated femurs (83%) achieved bone union as compared to empty scaffold controls (33%). Consistent with this observation, biomechanical evaluation of functional integration also revealed a significantly higher torsional stiffness observed for PRP-treated defects compared to empty scaffolds. Ultimate torque at failure was not improved, however, perhaps due to the slow resorption profile of the scaffold material. Histological evaluation illustrated infiltration of vascularized connective tissue and bone in both groups. Given that bone ingrowth into untreated defects in this model is minimal, PCL-TCP scaffolds were clearly able to promote bone ingrowth but failed to consistently bridge the defect. The addition of PRP to PCL-TCP scaffolds accelerated early vascular ingrowth and improved longer-term functional integration. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the use of PRP, alone or in combination with other bioactive components, may be an effective approach to augment the ability of porous biomaterial scaffolds to repair orthotopic defects.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In this study, we examined the ability of melanoma cells derived from patients with disseminated melanoma to engage in vasculogenic mimicry in order to identify key parameters in the complexity of the formation of capillary-like structure. We showed that disseminated melanoma as well as uveal and cutaneous melanoma adopts a vascular-related phenotype and engages in vasculogenic mimicry: the main geometrical features of capillary-like structure are determined during the first step of the vascular network assembly. We provided experimental evidence that capillary-like structure formation requires apoptotic cell death through activation of a caspase-dependent mechanism: a broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and a caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD blocked capillary-like structure formation. Apoptosis occurs before capillary-like structure formation but not after capillary-like structures have assembled.

We investigated the hypothesis that this autocrine action of TNF-alpha generates and sustains a network of other mediators that promote peritoneal cancer growth and spread. When compared with two ovarian cancer cell lines that did not make TNF-alpha, constitutive production of TNF-alpha was associated with greater release of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12, the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF), and the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). TNF-alpha production was associated also with increased peritoneal dissemination when the ovarian cancer cells were xenografted. We next used RNA interference to generate stable knockdown of TNF-alpha in ovarian cancer cells. Production of CCL2, CXCL12, VEGF, IL-6, and MIF was decreased significantly in these cells compared with wild-type or mock-transfected cells, but in vitro growth rates were unaltered. Tumor growth and dissemination in vivo were significantly reduced when stable knockdown of TNF-alpha was achieved. Tumors derived from TNF-alpha knockdown cells were noninvasive and well circumscribed and showed high levels of apoptosis, even in the smallest deposits. This was reflected in reduced vascularization of TNF-alpha knockdown tumors. Furthermore, culture supernatants from such cells failed to stimulate endothelial cell growth in vitro.

Expression of phospho-mTOR was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses of human tissues. For in vitro studies, human gastric cancer cell lines were used to determine S6K1, 4E-BP-1 and HIF-1alpha activation and cancer cell motility upon rapamycin treatment. Effects of rapamycin on tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo were assessed in both a subcutaneous tumor model and in an experimental model with orthotopically grown tumors. Mice received either rapamycin (0.5 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day) or diluent per intra-peritoneal injections.

Fibronectin, collagen IV and laminin are restricted to reticular fibres and have a similar distribution pattern, whereas perlecan is limited to the vascular system of the lymph node. Various compartments of the lymph node, such as the B-cell follicle, paracortex (including the high endothelial venules and paracortical cord), and medulla have been reconstructed to visualize their vasculature with respect to B and T cells. Since the morphology of lymph nodes may change significantly in pathological conditions, different compartments of reactive lymph node (after low-dose Listeria monocytogenes infection), especially germinal centres, were also investigated.

In our initial experiments utilizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)), we found no direct invasion. Instead, the fibrin was completely degraded and replaced with highly vascularized new tissue. Addition of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to the fibrin construct also did not result in construct vascularization. Because natural and regenerating tissues exhibit complex extracellular matrices (ECMs), we hypothesized that a more complex scaffold may improve blood vessel invasion. Addition of fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, and collagen type I within 20 mg/mL fibrin constructs resulted in no significant improvement. However, the same additive concentrations within 10 mg/mL fibrin constructs resulted in dramatic improvements, specifically with hyaluronic acid. Overall, we believe that these results indicate the importance of structural and functional cues of not only in the initial scaffold but also as the construct is degraded and remodeled.

In ten porcine eyes retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were removed using a silicone tipped cannula, in ten porcine eyes Bruch's membrane was perforated once with a retinal perforator without prior RPE removal and in ten eyes RPE removal was followed by a single perforation of Bruch's membrane. Fifteen of the eyes, five from each group, were enucleated 30 minutes after surgery, while the remaining eyes were enucleated after 14 days. Prior to enucleation, at day 14, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were obtained. Eyes were examined by light microscopy and by immunohistochemical staining. In addition to these 30 eyes, two eyes underwent surgery with the purpose of subsequent scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination.\nIn eyes enucleated immediately after surgery neuroretinas overlying the induced lesions were intact without apparent atrophy of cells regardless of the surgical technique applied. The process of RPE removal was found to induce breaks in Bruch's membrane and both the size and the number of breaks varied between eyes. CNV membranes were identified in 15 of 15 eyes enucleated after 14 days. CNV membranes induced by perforation of Bruch's membrane without prior RPE removal were significantly thicker than membranes from eyes undergoing both RPE removal and Bruch's perforation (p = 0.03) and also thicker than membranes from eyes with only RPE-removal (p < 0.01). CNV membranes from eyes with perforation of Bruch's membrane without prior RPE removal had a higher cellular content and were more richly vascularized and also exhibited the highest propensity to leak in fluorescense angiograms.\nAll three surgical techniques were capable of inducing CNV, but the one applying perforation of Bruch's membrane without RPE removal was easier to reproduce and involved fewer variables than the techniques utilizing RPE removal.

However, this strategy has been hampered by the lack of sources for human cardiomyocytes and by the scarce vasculature in the ischemic area limiting the engraftment and survival of the transplanted muscle. Beyond the necessity of endothelial capillaries for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the grafted muscle tissue, interactions between endothelial and cardiomyocyte cells may also play a key role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In the present study, we describe the formation of synchronously contracting engineered human cardiac tissue derived from human embryonic stem cells containing endothelial vessel networks. The 3D muscle consisted of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and embryonic fibroblasts (EmFs). The formed vessels were further stabilized by the presence of mural cells originating from the EmFs. The presence of EmFs decreased EC death and increased EC proliferation. Moreover, the presence of endothelial capillaries augmented cardiomyocyte proliferation and did not hamper cardiomyocyte orientation and alignment. Immunostaining, ultrastructural analysis (using transmission electron microscopy), RT-PCR, pharmacological, and confocal laser calcium imaging studies demonstrated the presence of cardiac-specific molecular, ultrastructural, and functional properties of the generated tissue constructs with synchronous activity mediated by action potential propagation through gap junctions.

The mean defect of distal femur was 15.8 cm (range, 14-18 cm) in length.\nThe mean length of distraction osteogenesis by Ilizarov's apparatus was 8.2 cm. The mean length of TVFG was 8 cm. The average duration from application of Ilizarov's apparatus to achievement of bony union was 10.2 months (range, 8-13 months). At the end of the follow-up, ranges of motion of three knees were 0 to 45 degrees, 0 to 60 degrees, and 0 to 90 degrees.

Although this model represents a good approximation for the smaller vessels, it does not take into account the nonlinear convective energy losses in larger vessels. Here, using Womersley's theory, we present a hybrid model that considers the nonlinear effects for the larger epicardial arteries while simulating the distal vessels (down to the 1st capillary segments) with the use of Womersley's Theory. The main trunk and primary branches were discretized and modeled with one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, while the smaller-diameter vessels were treated as Womersley-type vessels. Energy losses associated with vessel bifurcations were incorporated in the present analysis. The formulation enables prediction of impedance and pressure and pulsatile flow distribution throughout the entire coronary arterial tree down to the first capillary segments in the arrested, vasodilated state. We found that the nonlinear convective term is negligible and the loss of energy at a bifurcation is small in the larger epicardial vessels of an arrested heart. Furthermore, we found that the flow waves along the trunk or at the primary branches tend to scale (normalized with respect to their mean values) to a single curve, except for a small phase angle difference. Finally, the model predictions for the inlet pressure and flow waves are in excellent agreement with previously published experimental results.

In the last few years, immediate reconstruction of maxillary bones and soft tissues has proved to be a reliable morphofunctional reconstruction technique following surgery for large oncological defects or the late effects of radiation therapy. Among other free flaps such as composite fibula, composite scapula, or composite radial, the use of vascularized iliac crest with the internal oblique flap has become our flap choice for morphofunctional maxillary reconstruction for bone segments within 6-15 cm of length, and when there is no need for overlying facial skin or oral sphincter reconstruction. The advantages of this composite bone flap are its available large and resizable bone stock; the quality of the bone for transfer (optimal height, depth, and contour to maintain a good facial profile); and the possibility to properly reconstruct the oral lining, orbital content; and maxillary soft tissues with a portion of the internal oblique muscle flap raised with the same pedicle.

Previously, we suggested that this membrane is unusual in that it lacks several typical BM components, e.g. collagen IV, laminin B, perlecan, and fibronectin (Hummel, S., Osanger, A., Bajari, T.

In biosynthetic experiments using [3H]proline and [35S]sulfate, ggBM1 was shown to be synthesized by and secreted from the granulosa cells that support the developing oocyte. The acidic heterogeneous 135-kDa proteoglycan was converted to a protein with an apparent Mr of 95,000 by treatment with chondroitinase ABC and was completely degraded by collagenase. Sequencing of tryptic fragments revealed peptides typical of collagens. The follicular BM accumulated apolipoprotein B and apo-VLDLII, the major resident proteins of the yolk precursor very low density lipoprotein. Interestingly, and likely indicating an analogous situation to the follicle, ggBM1 is also a component of Bruch's membrane of the eye, which separates the vascularized choroid from retinal pigmented epithelial cells.

When osteoclasts obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cultured in the presence of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANKL) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), were treated with IFN-alpha, the expression of bone tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) type 5b was reduced, as well as calcium-phosphate resorption activity and expression of pro-osteoclatic transcription factor c-Fos.

The color content of the tumor scan was rated subjectively by the ultrasound examiner on a visual analog scale. Vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated in the whole tumor and in a 5-cm(3) sample taken from the most vascularized area of the tumor. Logistic regression analysis was used to build models to predict malignancy.\nThere were 79 benign tumors, six borderline tumors and 21 invasive malignancies. A logistic regression model including only gray-scale ultrasound variables (the size of the largest solid component, wall irregularity, and lesion size) was built to predict malignancy. It had an area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve of 0.98, sensitivity of 100%, false positive rate of 10%, and positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 10 when using the mathematically best cut-off value for risk of malignancy (0.12). The diagnostic performance of the 3D flow index with the best diagnostic performance, i.e. VI in a 5-cm(3) sample, was superior to that of the color content of the tumor scan (area under ROC curve 0.92 vs. 0.80, sensitivity 93% vs. 78%, false positive rate 16% vs. 27% using the mathematically best cut-off value). Adding the color content of the tumor scan or FI in a 5-cm(3) sample to the logistic regression model including the three gray-scale variables described above improved diagnostic performance only marginally, an additional two tumors being correctly classified.\nEven though 2D and 3D power Doppler ultrasound can be used to discriminate between benign and malignant ovarian tumors, their use adds little to a correct diagnosis of malignancy in an ordinary population of ovarian tumors.

{"title": "Alternative vascularization mechanisms in cancer: Pathology and therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "Although cancer cells are not generally controlled by normal regulatory mechanisms, tumor growth is highly dependent on the supply of oxygen, nutrients, and host-derived regulators. It is now established that tumor vasculature is not necessarily derived from endothelial cell sprouting; instead, cancer tissue can acquire its vasculature by co-option of pre-existing vessels, intussusceptive microvascular growth, postnatal vasculogenesis, glomeruloid angiogenesis, or vasculogenic mimicry. The best-known molecular pathway driving tumor vascularization is the hypoxia-adaptation mechanism. However, a broad and diverse spectrum of genetic aberrations is associated with the development of the \"angiogenic phenotype.\" Based on this knowledge, novel forms of antivascular modalities have been developed in the past decade. When applying these targeted therapies, the stage of tumor progression, the type of vascularization of the given cancer tissue, and the molecular machinery behind the vascularization process all need to be considered. A further challenge is finding the most appropriate combinations of antivascular therapies and standard radio- and chemotherapies.

Here, we investigated whether this subfertility is due to a defect in the ovary itself or to more general endocrine changes in ERbeta-/- mice. We transplanted ERbeta-/- ovaries into WT mice and WT ovaries into ERbeta-/- mice. Upon mating with ERbeta-/- males, fertility increased from 20% in control intact ERbeta-/- group to 40% in the WT recipients with ERbeta-/- ovaries. The transplantation procedure was not efficient, and when WT ovaries were transplanted into WT mice, fertility was only 36%. Surgical ovarian wedge resection, a procedure which induces ovulation in anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, resulted in 100% fertility of ERbeta-/- mice. In ERbeta-/- mice, as the follicles enlarged, the thecal layer remained very compact (revealed by H&E and collagen staining), and there was no increase in vascularization (measured as smooth muscle actin). In addition, there was an increase in PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and a decrease in PDGFbeta expression in the granulosa cells, similar to what has been found in follitropin receptor knockout mice. After wedge resection, expression of both smooth muscle actin and PDGFRs was normalized. During normal follicular development, increased vascularization of the thecal layer is a prerequisite for further follicular growth. We suggest that the defect in ERbeta-/- mouse ovaries is a failure of communication between the granulosa and thecal layers. The follicles do not mature because of insufficient blood supply.

In vitro, the siRNA-mediated MTf knockdown inhibited by 58% the cell surface activation of plasminogen into plasmin. In addition, decreased expression of MTf in melanoma cells reduced cell migration. In vivo, we used a nude mice invasion model in which tissue factor (TF) induces vascular [125I]-fibrin deposition following injection.

One of the difficulties with this procedure is identifying perforator arteries large enough to ensure that the harvested tissue is well vascularized. Current techniques involve imaging the perforator arteries with computed tomography (CT) to produce a grid mapping the locations of the perforator arteries relative to the umbilicus.\nTo compare the time it takes to produce a map of the perforators using either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) CT, and to see whether there is a benefit in using a 3D model.\nPatient CT abdomen and pelvis scans were acquired from a GE 64-slice scanner. CT image processing was performed with the GE 3D Advantage Workstation v4.2 software. Maps of the perforators were generated both as 2D and 3D representations. Perforators within a region 5 cm rostral and 7 cm caudal to the umbilicus were measured and the times to perform these measurements using both 2D and 3D images were recorded by a stopwatch.\nAlthough the 3D method took longer than the 2D method (mean [+/- SD] time 1:51+/-0:35 min versus 1:08+/-0:16 min per perforator artery, respectively), producing a 3D image provides much more information than the 2D images alone. Additionally, an actual-sized 3D image can be printed out, removing the need to make measurements and producing a grid.\nAlthough it took less time to create a grid of the perforators using 2D axial CT scans, the 3D reconstruction of the abdomen allows the plastic surgeons to better visualize the patient's anatomy and has definite clinical utility.\nLa technique du lambeau perforant \u00e9pigastrique inf\u00e9rieur est devenue une solution de rechange populaire chez les femmes qui ont besoin d\u2019une reconstruction mammaire.

The rats were fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and after 8 weeks of high cholesterol diet the animals were treated with statin (1 mg/kg bw/day) and resveratrol (20 mg/kg bw/day) for 2 weeks. The rats were assigned to: (1) Control (C), (2) HC, (3) HCR, (4) HCS and (5) HCRS. The hearts, subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion were used as experimental model.

Recent studies have shown that hedgehog signaling is involved in vascular development and it is possible that the diminished airway branching in Shh-deficient mice is due to abnormal pulmonary vasculature formation. Therefore, we investigated the role of Shh in pulmonary vascular development using Shh/Tie2lacZ compound mice, which exhibit endothelial cell-specific LacZ expression, and Pecam-1 immunohistochemistry. In E11.5-13.5 Shh-deficient mice, the pulmonary vascular bed is decreased, but appropriate to the decrease in airway branching. However, when E12.5 Shh-deficient lungs were cultured for 4-6 days, the vascular network deteriorated compared to wild-type lungs. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) or its receptor Vegfr2 (KDR/Flk-1) was not different between E12.5-13.5 Shh-deficient and wild-type lungs. In contrast, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), but not Ang2 or the angiopoietin receptor Tie2, mRNA expression was downregulated in E12.5-E13.5 lungs of Shh null mutants. Recombinant Ang1 alone was unable to restore in vitro branching morphogenesis in Shh-deficient lungs. Conversely, the angiogenic factor fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-2 alone or in combination with Ang1, increased vascularization and tubular growth and branching of Shh-deficient lungs in vitro. The angiogenic factors did not overcome the reduced smooth muscle cell differentiation in the Shh null lungs. These data indicate that early vascular development, mediated by Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling proceeds normally in Shh-deficient mice, while later vascular development and stabilization of the primitive network mediated by the Ang/Tie2 signaling pathway are defective, resulting in an abnormal vascular network.

Arsenic(III) exposure did not affect the overall health of the animals, the general structure of the liver, or hepatocyte morphology. There was no change in the total tissue arsenic levels, indicating that arsenic does not accumulate in the liver at this level of exposure. However, there was significant vascular remodeling with increased sinusoidal endothelial cell (SEC) capillarization, vascularization of the peribiliary vascular plexus (PBVP), and constriction of hepatic arterioles in As(III)-exposed mice. In addition to ultrastructural demonstration of SEC defenestration and capillarization, quantitative immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased sinusoidal PECAM-1 and laminin-1 protein expression, suggesting gain of adherens junctions and a basement membrane.

Hyperlipidemic patients show alterations in ocular vascularization. However, it is not known whether these alterations are reversible after the lipid profile returns to normal. This study evaluates a rabbit model of hypercholesterolemia, examining the ultrastructural changes in the choroid, and the changes in it after a period of normal blood-cholesterol values induced by a standard diet. Rabbits were divided into three groups: G0, fed a standard diet; G1A, fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months; and G1B, fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months followed by a standard diet for a further 6 months. Eyes were processed for transmission electron microscopy. G1A had a buildup of lipids at the suprachoroidea that compressed the vascular layers, and hypertrophy of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. In G1B there was less lipid accumulation than in G1A, but this was not followed by reversal of the choroidal damage. The suprachoroidea thickness of G1B was still greater than in G0 due to abundant collagen fibers. The intervascular spaces of the choroid had fewer lipids than G1A but more collagen fibers than G0.

Our analyses began with the early phases of healing, and continued until the implants were completely osseointegrated. We investigated aspects of osseointegration ranging from vascularization, cell proliferation, differentiation, and bone remodeling.

The HAI-1(-/-) placental labyrinth exhibited a complete failure of vascularization and a compact morphology of the trophoblast layer. Immunofluorescent staining of collagen IV and laminin and electron microscopy analysis revealed that this aberrant labyrinth architecture was associated with disrupted basement membranes located at the interface of chorionic trophoblasts and allantoic mesoderm. Unlike the placental labyrinth, basement membranes and vasculogenesis were normal in embryo and yolk sac. Therefore, basement membrane defects appear to be the underlying cause for the greatly impaired vascularization and trophoblast branching in HAI-1(-/-) placentas. In wild-type placentas, the expression of matriptase and prostasin co-localized with their physiological inhibitor HAI-1 to the labyrinthine trophoblast cells in proximity to basement membranes. In HAI-1(-/-) placentas, both the localization and expression of the two proteases remained unchanged, implying uncontrolled proteolytic activities of the two enzymes.

We address the epigenetic commitment of ASCs to the endothelial lineage. We report a bisulfite sequencing analysis of CpG methylation in the promoters of two endothelial-cell-specific genes, CD31 and CD144, in freshly isolated and in cultures of ASCs before and after induction of endothelial differentiation. In contrast to adipose tissue-derived endothelial (CD31(+)) cells, freshly isolated ASCs display a heavily methylated CD31 promoter and a mosaically methylated CD144 promoter despite basal transcription of both genes. Methylation state of both promoters remains globally stable upon culture. Endothelial stimulation of ASCs in methylcellulose elicits phenotypic changes, marginal upregulation of CD31, and CD144 expression and restrictive induction of a CD31(+)CD144(+) immunophenotype. These events are accompanied by discrete changes in CpG methylation in CD31 and CD144 promoters; however, no global demethylation that marks CD31(+) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells occurs. Immunoselection of CD31(+) cells after endothelial stimulation reveals consistent demethylation of one CpG immediately 3' of the transcription start site of the CD31 promoter. Adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation maintains CD31 and CD144 methylation patterns of undifferentiated cells. Methylation profiles of CD31 and CD144 promoters suggest a limited commitment of ASCs to the endothelial lineage. This contrasts with the reported hypomethylation of adipogenic promoters, which reflects a propensity of ASCs toward adipogenic differentiation.

However, these agents also inhibit endogenous growth factors preventing angiogenesis at the local tissue, interface thereby delaying the healing process and negatively impacting device performance. In this work, a combination of dexamethasone and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated for concurrent localized delivery using PLGA microsphere/PVA hydrogel composites. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated by histopathological examination of subcutaneous tissue surrounding implanted composites using a rat model. The hydrogel composites were capable of simultaneously releasing VEGF and dexamethasone with approximately zero order kinetics. Composites were successful in controlling the implant/tissue interface by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis as well as facilitating neo-angiogenesis at a fraction of their typical oral or i.v. bolus doses. Implants containing VEGF showed a significantly higher number of mature blood vessels at the end of the 4 week study irrespective of the presence of dexamethasone. Thus, localized concurrent elution of VEGF and dexamethasone can overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of the corticosteroid and can be used to engineer inflammation-free and well-vascularized tissue in the vicinity of the implant.

Based on that, we established a novel screening program for chaperone modulators that preferentially cytotoxic activity in cancer cells under glucose-deprived conditions. During the course of our screening system, we recently isolated an active compound, 326-2, from Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium and identified it as a down-regulator of the grp78 gene.

Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) is a multi-kinase inhibitor which targets receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases involved in tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis. The effect of sorafenib on tumor growth and tumor histology was assessed in both ectopic and orthotopic mouse models of RCC.\nSorafenib was administered orally to mice bearing subcutaneous (SC, ectopic) or sub-renal capsule (SRC, orthotopic) tumors of murine (Renca) or human (786-O) RCC. Treatment efficacy was determined by measurements of tumor volume and tumor growth delay. In mechanism of action studies, using the 786-O and Renca RCC tumor models, the effect of sorafenib was assessed after dosing for 3 or 5 days in the SC models and 21 days in the SRC models. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis was assessed by measuring level of CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effect of sorafenib on MAPK signaling, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation was also assessed by IHC by measuring levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-histone H3 and Ki-67 staining, respectively. The extent of tumor apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Finally, the effects of sorafenib on tumor hypoxia was assessed in 786-O SC model by injecting mice intravenously with pimonidazole hydrochloride 1 h before tumor collection and tumor sections were stained with a FITC-conjugated Hypoxyprobe antibody.\nSorafenib produced significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and a reduction in tumor vasculature of both ectopic and orthotopic Renca and 786-O tumors, at a dose as low as 15 mg/kg when administered daily. Inhibition of tumor vasculature was observed as early as 3 days post-treatment, and this inhibition of angiogenesis correlated with increased level of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL-positive) and central necrosis. Consistent with these results, a significant increase in tumor hypoxia was also observed 3 days post-treatment in 786-O SC model. However, no significant effect of sorafenib on phospho-ERK, phospho-histone H3 or Ki-67 levels in either RCC tumor model was observed.\nOur results show the ability of sorafenib to potently inhibit the growth of both ectopically- and orthotopically-implanted Renca and 786-O tumors. The observed tumor growth inhibition and tumor stasis or stabilization correlated strongly with decreased tumor angiogenesis, which was due, at least in part, to inhibition of VEGF and PDGF-mediated endothelial cell and pericyte survival.

The cell transforming ability of HHV-8 has been associated with the activation of NF-kappaB, a nuclear factor playing a pivotal role in promoting inflammation and cell proliferation; however, little is known about NF-kappaB activation during acute HHV-8 infection. In the present study, we used a recently established in vitro model of HHV-8 acute productive infection in endothelial cells to investigate the effect of HHV-8 on NF-kappaB activity and function. HHV-8 rapidly and potently induced NF-kappaB activity in endothelial cells via stimulation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK). Following IKK activation, HHV-8 selectively triggered the production of high levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), whereas it did not affect the expression of other NF-kappaB-dependent proinflammatory proteins, including TNF-alpha, IL-8, and RANTES. Deletion of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the MCP-1 enhancer resulted in significant inhibition of HHV-8-induced transcription. Furthermore, MCP-1 production was accompanied by virus-induced capillary-like structure formation at early stages of infection. The results suggest that HHV-8-induced MCP-1 may play an important role in promoting inflammation and pathogenic angiogenesis typical of HHV-8-associated lesions.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2006-12-02", "authors": ["ElisabettaCaselli", "SimonaFiorentini", "CarlaAmici", "DarioDi Luca", "ArnaldoCaruso", "M GabriellaSantoro"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2006-03-012500"}

Different mixtures of fibrin and collagen were used in conjunction with constant concentrations of matrix-bound VEGF and slow interstitial flow over 10 days. Interestingly, the BECs and LECs each showed a distinct preference in terms of organization for matrix composition: LECs organized the most extensively in a fibrin-only matrix, while BEC organization was optimized in the compliant collagen-containing matrices. Furthermore, the BECs and LECs produced architecturally different structures; while BECs organized in thick, branched networks containing wide lumen, the LECs were elongated into slender, overlapping networks with fine lumen.

Our data demonstrate a high VEGF binding capacity of BioD and a sustained release with a moderate initial burst. A proliferation assay using endothelial cells revealed maintenance of biological activity of VEGF after release from BioD. Release behavior of BioD was not improved by modification with mineralized collagen type I, as well as with a combination of mineralized collagen with O-phospho-L-serine and sodium citrate, respectively. In contrast, a positive impact of these modifications on the activity of released VEGF was observed; in case of the phosphoserine- and sodium citrate-modified cements, the biological efficacy of released VEGF was even higher than that of nonreleased control VEGF.

{"title": "The effects of aging on tumor growth and angiogenesis are tumor-cell dependent.", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that histologically similar tumors grow more slowly, with less angiogenesis, in aged mice relative to young mice. We subcutaneously implanted TRAMP-C2 tumor cells, a prostate cancer cell line not previously examined in aging, into syngeneic C57/Bl6 young (4 month) and aged (20 month) mice and compared tumor growth and angiogenesis. Unexpectedly, the prostate tumors grew as fast in aged as in young mice. Angiogenesis in TRAMP-C2 tumors was robust, with no differences between the young and aged mice in the number of vessels, distribution of vessel sizes or features of vessel maturation. Aged mice had lower levels of serum testosterone than the young mice. VEGF levels were similar in the tumors and sera of the young and aged mice. Comparison with B16/F10 melanoma, a cancer cell line that is representative of previous studies in aged mice, showed that B16/F10 tumors grew minimally in the aged mice. In contrast to the B16/F10, TRAMP-C2 tumors had an extracellular matrix with significantly higher levels of MMP2 and MMP9 expression and activity. These unique results demonstrate that tumor progression can be as robust in aged tissues as young tissues. The ability of aged mice to grow large, vascularized prostate tumors is associated with high levels of MMP2/9 activity that may produce a permissive environment for tumor growth and angiogenesis.

Two issues that must be addressed before cell therapy could be used routinely in medicine are improved efficacy of the transplanted cells and demonstrated long-term safety. Desirable genetic modifications that could be made to cells to be used for cell therapy include immortalization with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). We have used a model for cell therapy in which transplantation of adrenocortical cells restores glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone levels in adrenalectomized immunodeficient mice. In this model, clones of cells that had been immortalized with hTERT were shown to be able to replace the function of the animals' adrenal glands by forming vascularized tissue structures when cells were transplanted beneath the capsule of the kidney. hTERT-modified cells showed no tendency for neoplastic changes. Moreover, a series of experiments showed that hTERT does not cooperate with known oncoproteins in tumorigenesis either in adrenocortical cells or in human fibroblasts. Nevertheless, hTERT was required for tumorigenesis when cells were implanted subcutaneously rather than in the subrenal capsule space. Changes in gene expression make hTERT-modified cells more robust. Understanding these changes is important so as to be able to separately control immortalization and other desirable properties of cells that could be used in cell therapy. Alternatively, desirable properties of transplants might be provided by co-transplanted mesenchymal cells: mesenchymal cell-assisted cell therapy.

To determine the functional roles of the plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems in these processes, we have studied CL formation and function in plasminogen (plg)-deficient mice, with or without treatment with the broad-spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitor galardin. Both the adult pseudopregnant CL model and the gonadotropin-primed immature mouse model were used. We found that CL formed normally not only in plasminogen-deficient mice and in galardin-treated wild-type mice, but also in galardin-treated plg-deficient mice, suggesting that neither of the plasminogen activator and MMP systems is essential for CL formation. Nevertheless, in plg-deficient mice, serum progesterone levels were reduced by approximately 50%, and the progesterone levels were not reduced further by galardin treatment. When CL from plg-deficient mice were stained for several molecular markers for CL development and regression, they appeared healthy and vascularized, and were indistinguishable from CL from wild-type mice. This implies that the reduced progesterone levels were not caused by impaired CL formation. Taken together, our data suggest that neither plasmin nor MMPs, alone or in combination, are required for CL formation. Therefore, the tissue remodeling and angiogenesis processes during CL formation may be mediated by redundant protease systems. However, the reduced serum progesterone levels in plg-deficient mice suggest that plasmin, but not MMPs, plays a role in maintenance of luteal function.

The purpose of this study was to find explanations for these processes by searching for alternative pathways regulating glioma angiogenesis and reveal a correlation with tumor grade. Thus, VEGFR3, which is not expressed in normal brain, and its ligands VEGF-C and -D, were assessed in high grade (WHO degrees IV, glioblastomas, GBM) and low grade gliomas [WHO degrees II astrocytomas (AII)]. In all GBM, a strong protein expression of VEGFR3 was found on tumor endothelium, VEGF-C and -D expression was found on numerous cells in areas of high vascularization. On RNA level, a significant up-regulation of VEGFR3 was detected in GBM compared to AII and non-neoplastic brain. In AII, only very moderate VEGFR3, VEGF-C and -D expression was found on protein and RNA level indicating a correlation of VEGFR3 expression with tumor grade. VEGFR3 signal in both grades was found predominantly on endothelial cells, confirmed by VEGFR3 expression on isolated CD31 positive cells and the expression of various endothelial markers on VEGFR3-positive cells isolated from GBM.

Recorded running distances showed great inter-individual differences resulting in three different groups of low (L-EX, < 2629 m/night; n=5), moderate (M-EX, 3003 - 7458 m/night; n=10) and high (H-EX, > 8314 m/night; n=5) physical activity. The M-EX and H-EX group revealed significant (p<0.05) adaptive changes with an increase in heart mass per kg body weight and a decrease in mean body weight. Amongst the marker genes studied by mRNA expression analysis only ODC-1 appears to be differentially expressed. Its 1.8-fold increased steady-state mRNA level in the H-EX group suggests that synthesis of polyamines may be increased by physical activity. This new finding could provide a link between extensive physical activity and its protective effects on colon cancer development.", "journal": "International journal of sports medicine", "date": "2006-11-18", "authors": ["KBuehlmeyer", "FDoering", "HDaniel", "TSchulz", "HMichna"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2006-924362"}

The three other species of the genus have each been shown to encode homologs of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We report here that PVNZ strain RD86 also encodes a VEGF and that the predicted PVNZ protein shows only 37-54% amino acid identity to VEGFs encoded by the other species of the genus. Despite this extensive sequence divergence, assays of purified PVNZ VEGF (PVNZ(RD86)VEGF) demonstrated that it shares the unique VEGF receptor (VEGFR) binding profile of the other parapoxvirus VEGFs, in that it binds VEGFR-2 and induces VEGFR-2-mediated proliferation of Ba/F3-derived cells, but does not bind VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3. In contrast to some other viral VEGFs, it does not bind neuropilin-1. Our results indicate that PVNZ(RD86)VEGF is a biologically active member of the VEGF family and is likely to contribute to the proliferative and highly vascularized nature of PVNZ lesions. Our data also reveal that all members of the genus encode a VEGF and that an extraordinary degree of inter-species sequence variation is a general feature of the parapoxvirus VEGFs.", "journal": "Virus research", "date": "2006-11-18", "authors": ["NorihitoUeda", "Marie KInder", "Lyn MWise", "Stephen BFleming", "Andrew AMercer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.virusres.2006.09.012"}

The number of nutrient arteries found on each of the surfaces was summarized as follows. Most of the nutrient arteries pierced the fibula at its medial crest, while only one entered from the posterior surface. Most nutrient arteries were near the middle third of the fibula.

To study the role of endoglin in tumor growth and angiogenesis we induced a highly vascularized tumor in mice heterozygous for endoglin (Eng+/-) and in their control littermates (Eng+/+) by injecting 10(6) Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) cells subcutaneously. Nine days after injection, the tumor was removed and weighed. Capillary density (CD31 immunohistochemistry), hemoglobin content and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression were used to assess tumor vascularization. Tumor perfusion rate was measured by laser-Doppler technique. Expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by Western blot analysis. The aerobic metabolism and oxygen dependency were inferred from the measurement of ATP in tumoral tissue. Tumor weight, capillary density, hemoglobin and VCAM-1 were reduced by about 30% in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+ littermates. The protein levels of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS were significantly reduced in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+ mice. HIF expression was slightly reduced whereas VEGF level was slightly increased in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+. Tumor tissue levels of ATP and ADP were similar in both types of mice.

After 2, 4, or 6 weeks, tissue from chambers containing collagen I, fibrin glue, hyaluronan, or no added scaffold (control) had small amounts of vascularized connective tissue. Chambers containing sea sponge had moderate connective tissue growth together with a mild \"foreign body\" inflammatory response. Chambers containing laminin-1, at a concentration 10-fold lower than its concentration in Matrigel, resulted in a moderate adipogenic response. In summary, (1) biological hydrogels are resorbed and gradually replaced by vascularized connective tissue; (2) sponge-like matrices with large pores support connective tissue growth within the pores and become encapsulated with granulation tissue; (3) laminin-containing scaffolds facilitate adipogenesis.

{"title": "Short-term immunosuppression and surgical neoangiogenesis with host vessels maintains long-term viability of vascularized bone allografts.", "abstract": "Currently available methods to reconstruct large skeletal defects have limitations. These include nonunion and stress fractures in structural allografts, and inability to match the size, shape, and/or strength of most recipient sites using vascularized fibular autografts. Prosthetic diaphyseal replacements may loosen or produce periprosthetic fractures. Transplantation of living allogenic bone would enable matching donor bone to the recipient site, combined with the desirable healing and remodeling properties of living bone. We propose a novel method by which the transplantation of such tissue might be done without the risks of life-long immunosuppression, using surgical neoangiogenesis to develop a new host-derived osseous blood supply. We performed vascularized femoral allografts from 86 female Dark Agouti donor rats to male Piebald Virol Glaxo recipients across a major histocompatibility (MHC) barrier. In addition to microvascular reconstruction of the nutrient vessel, we surgically implanted a host arteriovenous (AV) bundle into the medullary canal to promote host vessel neoangiogenesis. Independent variables included patency of the implanted AV bundle, and use of 2 weeks' FK-506 immunosuppression. After 18 weeks, bone blood flow was measured, and neoangiogenic capillary density quantified. Bone blood flow and capillary density were significantly greater in transiently immunosuppressed recipients with a patent AV pedicle. We conclude that neoangiogenesis from implanted host-derived AV-bundles, combined with short-term immunosuppression maintains blood flow in vascularized bone allografts, and offers potential for clinical application.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society", "date": "2006-11-16", "authors": ["MichaelPelzer", "MikkoLarsen", "Yang-GukChung", "TeruyasuOhno", "Jeffrey LPlatt", "Patricia FFriedrich", "Allen TBishop"], "doi": "10.1002/jor.20313"}
{"title": "Tissue engineering of the anterior cruciate ligament using a braid-twist scaffold design.", "abstract": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most commonly injured intra-articular ligament of the knee. The insufficient vascularization of this tissue prevents it from healing completely after extreme tearing or rupture, creating a need for ACL grafts for reconstruction. The limitations of existing grafts have motivated the investigation of tissue-engineered ACL grafts. A successful tissue-engineered graft must possess mechanical properties similar to the ACL; to date no commercially available synthetic graft has achieved this. To accomplish this goal we have combined the techniques of polymer fiber braiding and twisting to design a novel poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) braid-twist scaffold for ACL tissue engineering. The scaffold is designed to accurately mimic the biomechanical profile and mechanical properties of the ACL. In this study, braid-twist scaffolds were constructed and compared to braided scaffolds and twisted fiber scaffolds. The addition of fiber twisting to the braided scaffold resulted in a significant increase in the ultimate tensile strength, an increase in ultimate strain, and an increase in the length of the toe region in these constructs over scaffolds that were braided. Based on the findings of this study, the braid-twist scaffold studied was found to be a promising construct for tissue engineering of the ACL.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2006-11-14", "authors": ["Joseph WFreeman", "Mia DWoods", "Cato TLaurencin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.09.025"}

The role of OPN during fracture healing was examined using wildtype and OPN(-/-) mice. Results showed that OPN plays an important role in regulation of angiogenesis, callus formation, and mechanical strength in early stages of healing and facilitates late stage bone remodeling and ECM organization.\nOsteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein with diverse localization and functionality that has been reported to play a regulatory role in both angiogenesis and osteoclastic bone remodeling, two vital processes for normal bone healing.\nBone repair in wildtype and OPN(-/-) mice was studied using a femoral fracture model. microCT was used for quantitative angiographic measurements at 7 and 14 days and to assess callus size and mineralization at 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Biomechanical testing was performed on intact bones and on fracture specimens at 14, 28, and 56 days. Histology and quantitative RT-PCR were used to evaluate cellular functions related to ECM formation and bone remodeling.\nOPN deficiency was validated in the OPN(-/-) mice, which generally displayed normal levels of related ECM proteins. Intact OPN(-/-) bones displayed increased elastic modulus but decreased strength and ductility. Fracture neovascularization was reduced at 7 but not 14 days in OPN(-/-) mice. OPN(-/-) mice exhibited smaller fracture calluses at 7 and 14 days, as well as lower maximum torque and work to failure. At 28 days, OPN(-/-) mice had normal callus size but a persistent reduction in maximum torque and work to failure. Osteoclast differentiation occurred normally, but mature osteoclasts displayed reduced functionality, decreasing late stage remodeling in OPN(-/-) mice. Thus, at 56 days, OPN(-/-) fractures possessed increased callus volume, increased mechanical stiffness, and altered collagen fiber organization.\nThis study showed multiple, stage-dependent roles of OPN during fracture healing. We conclude that OPN deficiency alters the functionality of multiple cell types, resulting in delayed early vascularization, altered matrix organization and late remodeling, and reduced biomechanical properties.

The floral anatomy of Actinocephalus polyanthus, Leiothrix fluitans, Paepalanthus chlorocephalus, P. flaccidus and Rondonanthus roraimae was studied here. The flowers of these species of Paepalanthoideae are unisexual, and form capitulum-type inflorescences. Staminate and pistillate flowers are randomly distributed in the capitulum and develop centripetally. This work aims to establish a floral nomenclature for the Eriocaulaceae to provide more information about the taxonomy and phylogeny of the family.\nLight microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and chemical tests were used to investigate the floral structures.\nStaminate and pistillate flowers are trimerous (except in P. flaccidus, which presents dimerous flowers), and the perianth of all species is differentiated into sepals and petals. Staminate flowers present an androecium with scale-like staminodes (not in R. roraimae) and fertile stamens, and nectariferous pistillodes. Pistillate flowers present scale-like staminodes (except for R. roraimae, which presents elongated and vascularized staminodes), and a gynoecium with a hollow style, ramified in stigmatic and nectariferous portions.\nThe scale-like staminodes present in the species of Paepalanthoideae indicate a probable reduction of the outer whorl of stamens present in species of Eriocauloideae. Among the Paepalanthoideae genera, Rondonanthus, which is probably basal, shows vascularized staminodes in their pistillate flowers.

{"title": "Reversion of tumor phenotype in surface transplants of skin SCC cells by scaffold-induced stroma modulation.", "abstract": "Interactions between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment play an essential role in controlling tumor development and progression. Here, we report that stromal modulation induced by a biodegradable meshwork (Hyalograft 3D) inhibited tumor vascularization and invasion of the locally invasive low-grade malignant human HaCaT-ras II-4 keratinocytes in a surface xenotransplantation assay. The scaffold caused formation of an active granulation tissue that shifted to a fibrotic-type connective tissue with accumulation of myofibroblasts and collagen bundles. Most importantly, in transplants with scaffolds, the epithelial-stromal border was normalized developing an ultrastructurally complete basement membrane (BM) including hemidesmosomes. The observed reversion of the tumor phenotype was not due to decreased tumor cell proliferation but correlated with (i) normalization of epidermal differentiation, (ii) condensation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and (iii) reduction of peritumoral protease activity Furthermore, inhibited invasion was paralleled by eliminated tumor vascularization. This was substantiated by a diminished endothelial VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) expression and, in turn, by a concomitant increase in the ECM components thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and endostatin, known to impair angiogenesis. Even in transplants of the metastatic high-grade malignant HaCaT-ras A-5RT3 keratinocytes the anti-invasive effect of the scaffold-modulated stroma prevailed. Tumor vascularization and invasion was reduced and the epithelial tissue partially normalized including formation of stretches of BM. This clearly demonstrates that the scaffold-modulated connective tissue not only blocks tumor invasion but reverts the tumor phenotype.

However, excessive and detrimental vascularization also occurs in neoplasia, promoting tumour growth and metastasis, as well as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and atherosclerosis. Greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling the angiogenic process will allow optimization of wound healing, and provide mechanisms to inhibit vascularization in tumours and other diseases. Evidence supports a cascade of events in which the perturbation of one of the steps is sufficient to significantly inhibit neovascularization. The extracellular macromolecules, notably glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are important mediators of angiogenesis. Hyaluronan (HA), a large, non-sulphated GAG, was first discovered in the vitreous of the eye [.], and is ubiquitously expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues. Native high molecular weight HA (n-HA) is anti-angiogenic, whereas HA degradation products (o-HA; 3-10 disaccharides) stimulate endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration and tube formation following activation of specific HA receptors in particular, CD44 and Receptor for HA-Mediated Motility (RHAMM, CD168).

Impedance indices (the ratios of the harmonics of pressure to the harmonics of flow) provide the investigator with a measure of the opposition to blood flow in a pulsatile system and are a proven indicator for vasculopathy. Previous studies investigating the eye's opposition to blood flow have concentrated on simple measures of resistance (the ratio of mean pressure difference to mean flow) which are more appropriate to a steady state or non-pulsatile system. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a new, non-invasive, method to determine the vascular impedance of the eye during the known physiologic stress of sustained isometric exercise.\nWaveforms of ocular blood flow and carotid arterial blood pressure were measured non-invasively. Ocular blood flow waveforms were calculated using the Langham-Silver method by measuring the small fluctuations in intraocular pressure intraocular pressure over time with a high fidelity pneumatonometer. Carotid arterial blood pressure waveforms were determined using a SphygmoCor electronic tonometer held over the common carotid artery of the neck. Both waveforms were recorded simultaneously in normal volunteers under two conditions: (1) a baseline resting state and (2) during sustained isometric exercise. The components of the two waveforms (the harmonics) were calculated using a Fast Fourier transform and expressed as a ratio in order to determine a set of impedance values for each condition. The first four impedance values were calculated.\n12 volunteers (six male: six female) with a mean age of 27 years (range 22-32 years) were recruited to the study. In comparison to baseline resting conditions, mean carotid blood pressure and heart rate both increased significantly during exercise: baseline mean carotid blood pressure, 82.6+/-8.2 mm Hg vs exercise mean carotid blood pressure, 93.8+/-12.8 mm Hg (p<0.001); baseline pulse rate, 64.6+/-9.1 BP(m) vs exercise pulse rate, 71.8+/-9.7 BP(m) (p<0.001). Compared to resting conditions, the first and third impedance values demonstrated significant change during exercise: the first impedance value rose (83.9+/-25.6 mm Hg-s/microl to 117.1 +/- 40.9 mm Hg-s/microl, p = 0.01) and the third impedance value fell (487.9 +/- 294.7 mm Hg-s/microl to 248.3+/-206.8 mm Hg-s/microl, p = 0.01).\nThe present study demonstrates, for the first time, a practical non-invasive method of calculating an index of impedance moduli for the pulsatile quotient of blood flow to the eye. Furthermore, during controlled isometric exercise, the impedance moduli displayed changes consistent with that known for a vascular system during vasoconstriction. The calculation of impedance moduli for the eye therefore shows promise for future investigations into ocular conditions where vascular obstruction is an aetiological factor.", "journal": "The British journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2006-10-20", "authors": ["Andrew JMorgan", "Sarah LHosking"], "doi": "10.1136/bjo.2006.098574"}

The BMSC sheets were harvested from culture flasks and wrapped around pre-seeded composite scaffolds. The layered cell sheets integrated well with the scaffold/cell construct and remained viable, with mineralized nodules visible both inside and outside the scaffold for up to 8 weeks culture. Cells within the constructs underwent classical in vitro osteogenic differentiation with the associated elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity and bone-related protein expression. In vivo, two sets of cell-sheet-scaffold/cell constructs were transplanted under the skin of nude rats. The first set of constructs (5 x 5 x 4mm(3)) were assembled with BMSC sheets and cultured for 8 weeks before implantation. The second set of constructs (10 x 10 x 4mm(3)) was implanted immediately after assembly with BMSC sheets, with no further in vitro culture. For both groups, neo cortical and well-vascularised cancellous bone were formed within the constructs with up to 40% bone volume. Histological and immunohistochemical examination revealed that neo bone tissue formed from the pool of seeded BMSC and the bone formation followed predominantly an endochondral pathway, with woven bone matrix subsequently maturing into fully mineralized compact bone; exhibiting the histological markers of native bone. These findings demonstrate that large bone tissues similar to native bone can be regenerated utilizing BMSC sheet techniques in conjunction with composite scaffolds whose structures are optimized from a mechanical, nutrient transport and vascularization perspective.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2006-10-19", "authors": ["YefangZhou", "FulinChen", "Saey TuanHo", "Maria AnnWoodruff", "Tit MengLim", "Dietmar WHutmacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.09.032"}

Although many methods have been proposed, none has proved completely satisfactory. Cellular mediators as a supplement to bone grafting and decompression is an attractive approach to this problem because it combines the desirable features of other procedures, each of which has shown a certain degree of effectiveness in stimulating bone growth and repair. Basic and clinical researches have shown the efficacy of various cellular mediators (bone morphogenetic proteins, interleukins, angiogenic growth factors, etc.) in healing bone defects. The potential application of these cellular mediators to other musculoskeletal conditions, including osteonecrosis of the femoral head, only recently has been explored. The surgical alternatives may include core decompression, osteotomy, nonvascularized, and vascularized bone grafting, which might be enhanced with the use of cellular mediators. At least three of these factors are potential candidates as therapeutic modalities: cytokines, bone morphogenetic proteins, and angiogenic factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of operation and multiple cellular mediators is an attractive method to preserve the femoral head for the therapy of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2006-10-19", "authors": ["BenxiangYuan", "ZudeLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2006.08.024"}

While the injury-repair-related activities of lmw-FGF-2 have been studied extensively, those of hmw-FGF-2 have not. Thus, we investigated the effects of hmw-FGF-2 on acute as well as chronic responses to myocardial infarction (MI) induced by irreversible coronary occlusion in the rat. Hmw- or lmw-FGF-2 was injected into the ischemic zone during acute evolving MI. Both isoforms were equally effective in reducing infarct size (at 24 h post-MI) and improving heart function up to 6 weeks post-MI, compared to a vehicle-treated infarcted group. Lmw-FGF-2 alone upregulated vascularization in the infarct. Hmw-FGF-2 elicited significant hypertrophy, compared to the vehicle-treated group, at 4-8 weeks post-MI, assessed by ultrasound, heart morphometry and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. In addition, hmw- (but not lmw-) FGF-2-treated hearts displayed increased accumulation of the cytokine cardiotrophin-1 and its signal transducer gp130. In culture, hmw- (but not lmw-) FGF-2 increased cardiomyocyte protein synthesis and cell size as well as upregulated cardiotrophin-1 released by cardiac fibroblasts, pointing to similar activities in vivo. Thus, hmw- and lmw-FGF-2 exert isoform-specific effects in the heart and only hmw-FGF-2 triggers cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth. Direct effects of hmw-FGF-2 on cardiomyocytes, becoming reinforced and sustained by upregulation of cardiotrophin-1 and acting in concert with other factors, are likely to contribute to post-MI hypertrophy.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2006-10-19", "authors": ["Zhi-ShengJiang", "MadhumathyJeyaraman", "Ge-BoWen", "Robert RFandrich", "Ian M CDixon", "Peter ACattini", "ElissavetKardami"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.09.002"}

Despite the improvement of slaughter conditions, the PSE type is still one of the main concerns in this field. This study was conducted on nonstressed animals to evaluate the tissue characteristics of some muscles usually involved during stress compared with a reference muscle, the M. triceps brachii, which is actually not subject to stress-caused damages. Samples of M. triceps brachii, M. longissimus dorsi, M. biceps femoris, and M. semimembranosus were taken from pigs exhibiting 1 of the 3 HAL genotypes (NN, Nn, or nn) and 2 of the 3 RN genotypes (rn+rn+ or rn+RN-). Histoenzymology and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the fiber typing and capillary network in these muscles within these different stress susceptibility genotypes. In comparison with the reference muscle, M. triceps brachii, the combination of a high value of the number of type IIb fibers and a low vascular network showed a primary effect on muscles usually involved during stress. This led to the definition of a PSE index. A dramatic increase (P < 0.001) in this PSE index was systematically found in muscles usually involved in the PSE-type condition. These results show that distinctive histological characteristics were associated with the vulnerability of some muscles independently of the genotypes.

Human ESC-derived embryonic endothelial cells underwent dose-dependent chemotaxis to SDF-1, which enhanced vascular network formation in Matrigel. Blocking of CXCR4 signaling abolished capillary-like structures induced by SDF-1. Inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, disrupted the endothelial sprouting outgrowth from human embryoid bodies, suggesting that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a critical role in regulating initial vessel formation, and may function as a morphogen during human embryonic vascular development.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2006-10-14", "authors": ["TongChen", "HaoBai", "YingShao", "MelanieArzigian", "ViktorJanzen", "EyalAttar", "YiXie", "David TScadden", "Zack ZWang"], "doi": "10.1634/stemcells.2006-0145"}

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor promoter-based conditionally replicative adenoviruses for pan-carcinoma application.", "abstract": "Treatment of advanced lung cancer is one of the major challenges in current medicine because of the high morbidity and mortality of the disease. Advanced stage lung cancer is refractory to conventional therapies and has an extremely poor prognosis. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Lung tumor formation depends on angiogenesis in which the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by cancer cells plays a pivotal role. Neutralizing VEGF with a soluble VEGF receptor suppresses tumor growth; however, the anticancer effect with this therapy is weakened after the intratumoral vascular network is completed. In this study, we turned the expression of VEGF by tumors to therapeutic advantage using a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus (CRAd) in which the expression of E1 is controlled by the human VEGF promoter. This virus achieved good levels of viral replication in lung cancer cells and induced a substantial anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. As a further enhancement, the cancer cell killing effect was improved with tropism modification of the virus to express the knob domain of Ad3, which improved infectivity for cancer cells. These VEGF promoter-based CRAds also showed a significant cell killing effect for various types of cancer lines other than lung cancer. Conversely, the VEGF promoter has low activity in normal tissues, and the CRAd caused no damage to normal bronchial epithelial cells. Since tumor-associated angiogenesis via VEGF signalling is common in many types of cancers, these CRAds may be applicable to a wide range of tumors. We concluded that VEGF promoter-based CRAds have the potential to be an effective strategy for cancer treatment.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2006-10-07", "authors": ["KTakayama", "P NReynolds", "YAdachi", "LKaliberova", "JUchino", "YNakanishi", "D TCuriel"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700991"}

Fgf18(-/-) mice have an apparent delay in skeletal mineralization that is not seen in Fgfr3(-/-) mice. However, this delay in mineralization could not be simply explained by FGF18 signaling to osteoblasts. Here we show that delayed mineralization in Fgf18(-/-) mice was closely associated with delayed initiation of chondrocyte hypertrophy, decreased proliferation at early stages of chondrogenesis, delayed skeletal vascularization and delayed osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment to the growth plate. We further show that FGF18 is necessary for Vegf expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and the perichondrium and is sufficient to induce Vegf expression in skeletal explants. These findings support a model in which FGF18 regulates skeletal vascularization and subsequent recruitment of osteoblasts/osteoclasts through regulation of early stages of chondrogenesis and VEGF expression.

The fetal part of the placenta forms through the fusion of the allantois and the chorionic plate around the stage of 7 somite pairs. The allantois, a mesodermal rudiment that provides fetal blood vessels to the placenta, was retrieved before fusion. We found in this rudiment expression of CD41, a known marker of early embryonic hematopoietic progenitors. c-Kit encoding a progenitor specific receptor was also expressed. Significantly, as early as the 1-2 somite stage, the allantois yielded erythroid, myeloid and multipotent clonogenic progenitors, when pre-cultured in toto prior to seeding in a semisolid medium.

We have shown previously that autologous blood can be mixed with a polymer solution containing chitosan in a glycerol phosphate (GP) buffer (chitosan-GP), and that implantation of this polymer/blood composite onto marrow-stimulated chondral defects in rabbit and sheep leads to the synthesis of more chondral repair tissue with greater hyaline character compared to marrow-stimulation alone. In the current study, we examined the modulation of cell recruitment and repair tissue characteristics at early post-surgical time points (from day 1 to 56) in a rabbit model to elucidate potential mechanisms behind this improved repair outcome.\nThirty-three skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits underwent bilateral arthrotomies, with each trochlea receiving a cartilage defect (3.5 mm x 4.5mm) bearing four microdrill holes (0.9 mm diameter, approximately 4 mm deep) into the subchondral bone. One defect per rabbit was treated with a chitosan-GP/blood implant, while the other defect was left as a microdrilled control. Repair tissues were stained by histochemistry, for collagen types I, II, and X by immunohistochemistry and analyzed using quantitative stereological tools.\nHistological analyses demonstrated that control defects followed a typical healing sequence observed previously in marrow-stimulation animal models while chitosan-GP/blood implants led to three significant modifications in the healing sequence at early stages: (1) increased inflammatory and marrow-derived stromal cell recruitment to the microdrill holes, (2) increased vascularization of the provisional repair tissue in the microdrill holes, and (3) increased intramembranous bone formation and subchondral bone remodeling (BR).\nThese results suggest that the greater levels of provisional tissue vascularization and BR activity are main factors supporting improved cartilage repair when chitosan-GP/blood implants are applied to marrow-stimulated cartilage lesions.", "journal": "Osteoarthritis and cartilage", "date": "2006-09-30", "authors": ["AChevrier", "C DHoemann", "JSun", "M DBuschmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joca.2006.08.007"}

Therefore, early selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy is desirable. Response to treatment may be determined by the delivery of the drug to the tumor, retention of the drug in the tumor and by the amount of intracellular uptake, metabolic activation and catabolism, as well as other factors. The first aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of DCE-MRI with the contrast agent Gd-DTPA for tumor response to first-line chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer. The second aim was to investigate the predictive value of 5-fluorouracil (FU) uptake, retention and catabolism as measured by localized (19)F MRS for tumor response to FU therapy. Since FU uptake, retention and metabolism may depend on tumor vascularization, the relationship between (19)F MRS and the DCE-MRI parameters k(ep), K(trans) and v(e) was also examined (1). In this study, 37 patients were included. The kinetic parameters of DCE-MRI, k(ep), K(trans) and v(e), before start of treatment did not predict tumor response after 2 months, suggesting that the delivery of chemotherapy by tumor vasculature is not a major factor determining response in first-line treatment. No evident correlations between (19)F MRS parameters and tumor response were found. This suggests that in liver metastases that are not selected on the basis of their tumor diameter, FU uptake and catabolism are not limiting factors for response. The transfer constant K(trans), as measured by DCE-MRI before start of treatment, was negatively correlated with FU half-life in the liver metastases, which suggests that, in metastases with a larger tumor blood flow or permeability surface area product, FU is rapidly washed out from the tumor.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2006-09-29", "authors": ["H W Mvan Laarhoven", "D W JKlomp", "MRijpkema", "Y L MKamm", "D J ThWagener", "J OBarentsz", "C J APunt", "AHeerschap"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1098"}

Sixteen patients with HNT underwent 3D-TREAT during the CA administration on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Using a parallel imaging acceleration factor of 2, 20 3D data sets at a temporal resolution of 2.3 s/frame were acquired. The quality of tumor delineation, vascularization type, and enhancement pattern were evaluated. Quantitative assessment included measurement of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), determination of signal-intensity-over-time (SIT) curves, time-to-peak enhancement within the carotid arteries and the tumor, and the delay between both. TREAT was compared to conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in six patients. Tumor delineation with TREAT was very good or good in 11/16 patients, and better with TREAT than with DSA in 3/6 cases. The CNR was significantly different for glomus tumors versus hypovascularized malignant tumors with TREAT (p=0.0001), but not on T1-weighted gradient echo (T1w GE) images. Qualitative assessment of tumor vascularization on dynamic TREAT shows good correlation (r=0.75) to quantitative SIT curves. We conclude that TREAT imaging permits the characterization of tumor vascularity and holds promise as a supplementary diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of HNT.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2006-09-12", "authors": ["H JMichaely", "K AHerrmann", "ODietrich", "M FReiser", "S OSchoenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-006-0394-z"}

After being treated at different temperatures, pHs, and solvent species for distinct durations, the remaining activities of Rg(1) and Re on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation were examined in vitro. Additionally, the remaining activity of each treated test agent, mixed in a growth factor-reduced Matrigel, in stimulating angiogenesis was evaluated subcutaneously in a mouse model. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was used as a control. It was found in vitro that HUVEC proliferation, migration in a Transwell plate, and tube formation on Matrigel were all significantly enhanced in the presence of bFGF, Rg(1), or Re. However, after being treated at different temperatures, pHs, or solvent species, the remaining activity of bFGF on HUVEC behaviors reduced significantly. This observation was more significant with increasing the duration of treatment. In contrast, the activities of Rg(1) and Re remained unchanged throughout the entire course of the study. The in vivo results observed on day 7 after implantation showed that the blank control (Matrigel alone) was slightly vascularized. In contrast, the density of neo-vessels in the Matrigel plug mixed with bFGF, Rg(1), or Re was significantly enhanced. However, after being treated, the density of neo-vessels was significantly reduced in the Matrigel plug mixed with bFGF, while those of Rg(1) and Re remained unchanged. The aforementioned results suggested that Rg(1) and Re could be a novel group of nonpeptide angiogenic agents with a superior stability and may be used for the management of tissue regeneration.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2006-09-12", "authors": ["Lin-ChienYu", "Sung-ChingChen", "Wei-ChunChang", "Ya-ChunHuang", "Kurt MLin", "Po-HongLai", "Hsing-WenSung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2006.08.009"}

Recent advances have made possible the using of stem cells as cell sources for therapeutic angiogenesis, including the vascularization of engineered tissue grafts. The goal of this study was to examine the endothelial potential of human umbilical cord-derived stem (UCDS) cells. UCDS cells were initially characterized and differentiated in an endothelial differentiation medium containing VEGF and bFGF. Differentiation into endothelial cells was determined by acetylated low-density lipoprotein incorporation and expression of endothelial-specific proteins, such as PECAM and CD34. In vivo, the transplanted UCDS cells were sprouting from local injection and differentiated into endothelial cells in a hindlimb ischemia mouse model.

In this study, both in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted with ECGS to correlate in vitro release of multiple angiogenic growth factors to vascularization potential in vivo. The short-term release of ECGS from calcium alginate gels supported in the lumen of polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers was investigated in vitro for up to 142 h. The overall time constant increased from 2, 2.2 and 6.3 h as the alginate concentration was increased from 1.5%, 2% and 3%, respectively.

In addition to our previous report on differential expression of proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in cartilage tumors, we analyzed the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1), which has been identified as a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. We further used a chondrosarcoma cell line to study the effect of interleukin (IL)-1beta and hypoxia on the regulation of ADAMTS1 and VEGF-A expression. ADAMTS1 was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in all analyzed samples from enchondromas, conventional chondrosacromas, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas without exception. In contrast to previous reports on other cancers, we did not detect a consistent decrease in ADAMTS1 expression in chondrosarcomas. Interleukin-1beta stimulation, not hypoxia, transcriptionally downregulated ADAMTS1 in chondrosarcoma cells, whereas VEGF-A expression was upregulated either by hypoxia or IL-1beta. We conclude that ADAMTS1 and VEGF-A in chondrosarcoma cells are regulated independently from each other.

For the first time, in this study, neo-vascularization and glial scar formation were investigated in the brain of soman-poisoned mice over a 3-month period after nerve agent exposure (1.2 LD50 of soman). Using anti-claudin-5 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunostaining techniques on brain sections, blood vessels were quantified and VEGF expression was verified to appraise the level of neo-angiogenesis induced in damaged brain areas. Furthermore, glial scar formation and neuropathology were estimated over time in the same injured brain regions by anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry and hemalun-phloxin (H&P) dye staining, respectively. VEGF over-expression was noticed on post-soman day 3 in lesioned areas such as the hippocampal CA1 field and amygdala. This was followed by an increase in the quantity of mature blood vessels, 3 months after soman poisoning, in the same brain areas. On the other hand, massive astroglial cell activation was demonstrated on post-soman day 8. Reactive astroglial cells were located only in damaged cerebral regions where H&P-stained eosinophilic neurons were found. For longer experimental times, astroglial response slowly decreased overtime but remained detectable on post-soman day 90 in some discrete brain regions (i.e. CA1 field and amygdala) evidencing the formation of a glial scar.

For this study, fiber-mesh scaffolds obtained from a blend of starch and poly(caprolactone) (SPCL), that have previously been shown to be an excellent material for the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow cells and thereby represent great potential as constructs for bone regeneration, were examined for endothelial cell (EC) compatibility. To be successfully applied in vivo, this tissue engineered construct should also be able to support the growth of ECs in order to facilitate vascularization and therefore assure the viability of the construct upon implantation. The main goal of this study was to examine the interactions between ECs and SPCL fiber meshes. Primary cultures of HUVEC cells were selected as a model of macrovascular cells and the cell line HPMEC-ST1.6R as a model for microvascular ECs. Both macro- and microvascular ECs adhered to SPCL fiber-mesh scaffolds and grew to cover much of the available surface area of the scaffold. In addition, ECs growing on the SPCL fibers exhibited a typical morphology, maintained important functional properties, such as the expression of the intercellular junction proteins, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin, the expression of the most typical endothelial marker vWF and sensitivity to pro-inflammatory stimuli, as shown by induction of the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

We showed that quantification of intra-tumor microvessels between HFCDUS and immunohistochemistry is correlated using an anti-CD31 antibody. Furthermore, quantification of tumor necrosis with HFUS was confirmed by histological examination of hematoxylin-eosin-saffranin-stained sections over the observation period. Subsequently, for the assessment of novel angiogenic inhibitors, HFCDUS and HFUS were used to elucidate the underlying dynamics linking vessel inhibition and tumor eradication. We describe a novel application for HFCDUS/HFUS that constitutes an effective, convenient, and non-invasive method for clinical assessment of angiogenic inhibitors.

The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize chitosan-GP/blood clots in vitro, and (2) to develop a rabbit marrow stimulation model in order to determine the effects of the chitosan-GP/blood implant and of debridement on the formation of incipient cartilage repair tissue.\nBlood clots were characterized by histology and in vitro clot retraction tests. Bilateral 3.5 x 4 mm trochlear defects debrided into the calcified layer were pierced with four microdrill holes and filled with a chitosan-GP/blood implant or allowed to bleed freely as a control. At 1 day post-surgery, initial defects were characterized by histomorphometry (n=3). After 8 weeks of repair, osteochondral repair tissues between or through the drill holes were evaluated by histology, histomorphometry, collagen type II expression, and stereology (n=16).\nChitosan-GP solutions structurally stabilized the blood clots by inhibiting clot retraction. Treatment of drilled defects with chitosan-GP/blood clots led to the formation of a more integrated and hyaline repair tissue above a more porous and vascularized subchondral bone plate compared to drilling alone. Correlation analysis of repair tissue between the drill holes revealed that the absence of calcified cartilage and the presence of a porous subchondral bone plate were predictors of greater repair tissue integration with subchondral bone (P<0.005), and of a higher total O'Driscoll score (P<0.005 and P<0.01, respectively).\nChitosan-GP/blood implants applied in conjunction with drilling, compared to drilling alone, elicited a more hyaline and integrated repair tissue associated with a porous subchondral bone replete with blood vessels.

We show in this report that doxorubicin causes disruption of the hair-follicle-associated blood vessel network resulting in a greatly reduced density of these blood vessels. Dystrophic hair follicles were also observed with abnormal melanogenesis in the mice treated with doxorubicin. Visualization of the effect of doxorubicin on hair-follicle angiogenesis was made possible by the use of transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein was driven by regulatory elements of the nestin gene (ND-GFP). In these transgenic mice, the hair-follicle stem cells and the follicle structure as well as the blood vessels associated with the hair follicles express ND-GFP. The hair-follicle stem cells did not appear to be affected by doxorubicin, which may explain why hair regrows after chemotherapy.

Tissues were prepared following a new preparation technique intended for high-resolution synchrotron tomography of microvascular networks. The resulting 3D images with a spatial resolution of less than the minimum capillary diameter permit a complete description of the entire vascular network for volumes as large as tens of cubic millimeters. The structural properties of the vascular networks were investigated by several multiscale methods such as fractal and power-spectrum analysis. These investigations gave a new coherent picture of normal and pathological complex vascular structures. They showed that normal cortical vascular networks have scale-invariant fractal properties on a small scale from 1.4 mum up to 40 to 65 mum. Above this threshold, vascular networks can be considered as homogeneous. Tumor vascular networks show similar characteristics, but the validity range of the fractal regime extend to much larger spatial dimensions. These 3D results shed new light on previous two dimensional analyses giving for the first time a direct measurement of vascular modules associated with vessel-tissue surface exchange.", "journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "date": "2006-06-01", "authors": ["LaurentRisser", "FranckPlourabou\u00e9", "AlexandreSteyer", "PeterCloetens", "G\u00e9raldineLe Duc", "CarolineFonta"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600332"}
{"title": "Evaluation of femoral head vascularization in slipped capital femoral epiphysis before and after cannulated screw fixation with use of contrast-enhanced MRI: initial results.", "abstract": "In this study we used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the vascularization of the femoral head in children with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) before and after cannulated screw fixation. Eleven consecutive children with SCFE, seven boys and four girls, aged 10-15 years were included in the study. There were no preslips; four children had acute, three acute-on-chronic, and four chronic SCFE. The MRI examinations were performed in a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with use of a coronal STIR sequence, a coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence, and a sagittal three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence. Morphology, signal intensities, and contrast-enhancement of the femoral head were assessed by two radiologists in consensus. Morphologic distortion of the physis, bone marrow edema within the metaphysis and epiphysis, and joint effusion were the preoperative MRI findings of SCFE in each child. In nine children, the vascularization of the femoral head before and after surgery was normal. In one child, a preoperative avascular zone in the superolateral aspect of the epiphysis revascularized completely after surgery. One child with severe SCFE developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head after open reduction of the slip. We conclude that MRI allows for accurate evaluation of the femoral head vascularization before and after surgery in children with SCFE.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2006-04-21", "authors": ["GStaatz", "DHonnef", "AKochs", "CHohl", "TSchmidt", "HR\u00f6hrig", "R WG\u00fcnther"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-006-0261-y"}
{"title": "Structural and functional outcome of scleral patch graft.", "abstract": "To evaluate the visual and structural outcomes of scleral patch grafting in cases of scleral defect.\nThe study was a retrospective interventional case series. Medical records of all patients who underwent scleral patch grafting at a tertiary care centre between 1997 and 2003 for scleral defects were reviewed. After removal of all the devitalized tissue, alcohol-preserved full-thickness sclera was tailored to fit the defect and sutured in place. The graft was covered with a conjunctival flap or amniotic membrane. Structural integrity and visual outcome were assessed as the main outcome measures.\nA total of 13 eyes of 13 patients required scleral patch grafting for scleral defects of varying aetiologies, the most common being necrotizing scleritis following pterygium surgery (40%). The patients were followed up for 6-60 months, an average period of 24.3 months. Tectonic success was achieved in 10 eyes (76.9%). Three complications were noted: endophthalmitis, graft necrosis, and graft dehiscence with uveal prolapse. However, no regrafts were needed. Epithelialization and vascularization were seen in the remaining eyes after an average duration of 3-4 weeks. Visual acuity remained stable in the majority (9/13, 60%), improved in one and deteriorated in three eyes.\nScleral grafting with overlying conjunctival or amniotic membrane graft is an effective and simple measure for preserving globe integrity both structurally and functionally.", "journal": "Eye (London, England)", "date": "2006-04-08", "authors": ["V SSangwan", "VJain", "PGupta"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.eye.6702344"}
{"title": "Neuropeptide Y in neural crest-derived tumors: effect on growth and vascularization.", "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter recently found to be a potent growth and angiogenic factor. The peptide and its receptors are abundant in neural crest-derived tumors, such as sympathetic neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas, as well as parasympathetic Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors. NPY regulates their growth directly, by an autocrine activation of tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis, and indirectly, by its angiogenic activity. The overall effect of the peptide on tumor growth depends on a balance between these processes and the type of receptors expressed in the tumor cells. Thus, NPY and its receptors may become targets for the treatment of neural tumors, directed against both tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2006-03-04", "authors": ["JoannaKitlinska"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.010"}
