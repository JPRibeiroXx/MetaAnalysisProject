The patient required orthodontics and surgical corticotomy and implantology (both performed with a piezo device). A multidisciplinary planning approach, including orthodontics, oral and periodontic surgery, and restorative dentistry, has an important role in the final outcome of treatment. In fact a dental class I occlusion has been established only on the right side. The left side could not be restored to an ideal class I relationship due to the pontic prosthesis. The original collapsed right posterior occlusion was corrected. A stable posterior occlusion was established, and the balancing interference was eliminated. Centric relation and centric occlusion were established at the same vertical dimension of occlusion. The cephalometric analysis and clinical aspect at the end of treatment showed that the patient had improvements in overbite and overjet.Multidisciplinary management, including endodontic and restorative dentistry, periodontics, corticotomy-assisted orthodontics, implants, and prosthetics, was used for a young female patient with multiple missing teeth, anterior deep bite, and a malocclusion with cant of the occlusal plane.

Photothermal excitation allows for an AFM cantilever driving force that varies smoothly as a function of drive frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spurious resonant vibrations that hinder piezoelectric excitation schemes. A complication of PTE FMM is that the sub-resonance cantilever vibration shape is fundamentally different compared to piezoelectric excitation. By directly measuring the vibrational shape of the cantilever, we show that PTE FMM is an accurate nanomechanical characterization method.

{"title": "Use of Human Fascia Lata in Rat Calvarial Bone Defects.", "abstract": "Tooth loss leads to a decrease in alveolar bone volume, and consequently to the need for guided bone regeneration (GBR) techniques to restore bone anatomy, and the adequate choice of therapy. Fascia lata membrane (FLM) has been used in surgical procedures in neurology, orthopedics, otorhinolaryngology, cardiology, vascular surgery, gynecology, and dentistry for guided tissue regeneration. The aim of the present preliminary study was to evaluate bone tissue response in rat calvarial bone defects covered with human fascia lata membrane (FLM). Eight Wistar rats, 230g body weight, were subjected to bone surgery to create a 5x5mm long/ 1mm deep calvarial bone defect on either side of the median suture, using a piezoelectric scalpel and irrigation. The animals were treated according to the following protocol: Group I (GI): placement of a single layer of FLM (Biotar, Rosario, Prov. de Santa Fe, Argentina) to cover the defects; Group II (GII): double layer of FLM to cover the defects; Group III: no membrane; Group IV: control. All the animals were euthanized 60 days post-surgery; the heads were resected, radiographed, decalcified, and processed for embedding in paraffin and Hematoxylin-Eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. All bone defects covered with a single or double layer of FLM showed adequate osteogenesis, and none exhibited an inflammatory response. Groups III and IV Control showed scant osteogenesis and no alterations in soft tissues. The results obtained with this experimental model show biocompatibility of FML with the surrounding tissues at the studied time points. No alterations were observed in osteocytic lacunae or osteocytes in the bone after osteotomy using a piezoelectric scalpel. Further studies need to be conducted to assess bone tissue response to FLM in combination with bone substitutes.\nLa p\u00e9rdida de piezas dentarias conlleva la disminuci\u00f3n volum\u00e9trica del hueso alveolar y la necesidad de recurrir a t\u00e9cnicas de regeneraci\u00f3n \u00f3sea guiada (ROG) para restablecer las condiciones anat\u00f3micas y aplicar las terap\u00e9uticas adecuadas.

A PVDF sling was used in surgeries on 23 women. A comparison group was randomly selected among all women treated with a PP sling in a 1:4 ratio (n = 92). Failure incidence was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival functions and a multivariate Cox regression model. Results Both groups were similar in their initial characteristics. The median follow-up was 24.6 months in the PP group and 21.3 months in the PVDF group. The survival functions showed a higher incidence of failures in the PP group, primarily because of obstructive symptoms. However, the differences were not statistically significant (hazard ratio of failure of PP vs PVDF 4.31; 95% confidence interval 0.56-33.05). Complication rates did not differ between the two groups.

The factors considered for experimental design were the UV (ultraviolet)-irradiation time, the concentrations of the initiator and solvent, and the kinds and concentrations of the silane coupling agent. The optimum operating conditions determined were UV-irradiation time of 25 min, an initiator concentration of 0-0.25 wt.%, solvent of N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC), and silane coupling agent KH570 with a concentration of 7 wt.%. The obtained optimal parameters were located in the valid region and the experimental confirmation tests conducted showed good accordance between predicted and experimental values.

This study prepared porous hydroxyapatite (HA)/BaTiO3 piezoelectric composites with porosity of 40%, 50% and 60% by ice-templating method. Effects of HA/BaTiO3 composites with different porosities, with and without polarizing treatment on adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts were investigated in vitro. Results revealed that cell densities of the porous groups were significantly higher than those of the dense group (p<0.05), so did the alkaline phosphate (ALP) and bone gla protein (BGP) activities. Porosity of 50% group exhibited higher ALP activity and BGP activity than those of the 40% and 60% groups. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that osteoblasts adhered and stretched better on porous HA/BaTiO3 than on the dense one, especially HA/BaTiO3 with porosity of 50% and 60%. However, there was no significant difference in the cell morphology, cell densities, ALP and BGP activities between the polarized group and the non-polarized group (p>0.05).

{"title": "Improved synthetic-heterodyne Michelson interferometer vibrometer using phase and gain control feedback.", "abstract": "Synthetic-heterodyne demodulation is a useful technique for dynamic displacement and velocity measurement using interferometric sensors as it can provide an output signal which is immune to interferometric drift. With the advent of cost effective, high-speed real-time signal processing systems and software, processing of the complex signals encountered in interferometry has become more feasible. In conventional synthetic-heterodyne demodulation schemes, to obtain the dynamic displacement or vibration of the object under test requires knowledge of the interferometer visibility and also the argument of two Bessel functions. In this paper, a new synthetic-heterodyne demodulation method is described leading to an expression for the dynamic displacement and velocity of the object under test that is significantly less sensitive to the received optical power. In addition, the application of two independent phase and gain feedback loops is used to compensate for the nonideal gain and phase response of the anti-aliasing filter required for the signal acquisition of the received wideband interferometer signal. The efficacy of the improved system is demonstrated by measuring the displacement sensitivity frequency response and linearity of a Piezoelectric Mirror-Shifter (PMS) over a range of 200\u00a0Hz-9\u00a0kHz. In addition, the system is used to measure the response of the PMS to triangular and impulse type stimuli.

Phased array piezoelectric transducers can be operated at different phase shifts to produce a two-dimensionally inhomogeneous domain of phase grating in the acousto-optic media. Also this domain can be steered at different angles by selecting the phase shift appropriately. This mechanism of dynamically tilting the refractive index-modulated domain enables adjusting the incident angle of light on the phase grating plane without moving the light source. So the Bragg angle of incidence can be always achieved at any acoustic frequency, and consequently, the deflector can operate under the Bragg diffraction condition at the optimum diffraction efficiency.

In this work, the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric constants of AlN single crystals were investigated at elevated temperatures up to 1000\u00b0C by the resonance method. We used resonators of five different modes to obtain a complete set of material constants of AlN single crystals. The electrical resistivity of AlN at elevated temperature (1000\u00b0C) was found to be greater than 5 \u00d7 10(10) \u03a9 \u00b7 cm. The resonance frequency of the resonators, which was mainly determined by the elastic compliances, decreased linearly with increasing temperature, and was characterized by a relatively low temperature coefficient of frequency, in the range of -20 to -36 ppm/\u00b0C. For all the investigated resonator modes, the elastic constants and the electromechanical coupling factors exhibited excellent temperature stability, with small variations over the full temperature range, <11.2% and <17%, respectively. Of particular significance is that due to the pyroelectricity of AlN, both the dielectric and the piezoelectric constants had high thermal resistivity even at extreme high temperature (1000\u00b0C). Therefore, high electrical resistivity, temperature independence of electromechanical properties, as well as high thermal resistivity of the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties, suggest that AlN single crystals are a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric sensing applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2016-01-14", "authors": ["TaeyangKim", "JinwookKim", "RafaelDalmau", "RaoulSchlesser", "EdwardPreble", "XiaoningJiang"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2015.007252"}

That is why sleep related physiological measurements have been in the focus of many scientific studies along the years, and why a large number of different measurement methods have been developed for this purpose. The ability to monitor heart rate respiration without any sensors or electrodes being directly attached to the body is extremely useful especially in long-term monitoring and it allows automated daily measurements without any medical staff present. This is the reason why ballistocardiographic force sensors and accelerometers have been introduced alongside electrocardiography (ECG) and thermistors or respiration belts as a means to monitor the heart rate and respiration during sleep. While ECG remains as the most reliable and accurate method for heart rate monitoring, the development of unobtrusive monitoring methods has improved to the point where the commercialization of such sleep monitoring systems has been possible. In this paper, the signals of five sensors and sensor placement combinations for measuring physiological parameters from a sleeping person are evaluated and compared in terms of their measurement sensitivities and waveform quality.

Recently there has been increasing demand for mobile electronic devices, such as mobile phones, to become smaller, thinner, and lighter. In contrast to a three dimensional audio system with magnets, we have invented a new type of flexible two dimensional device by utilizing the reverse piezoelectric effect in certain piezoelectric materials. Crystalline piezoelectric materials show electromechanical interaction between the mechanical state and the electrically-charged state. The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). We have adopted the plasma surface treatment in order to put coating materials on the surface of piezoelectric film. We compared two kinds of coating material, indium tin oxide and single-walled carbon nanotube, and found that single-walled carbon nanotube shows better performance.

A piezoelectric inkjet printhead located atop a drying tube produces precise droplets containing defined quantities of analyte.

Because this is a drop-on-demand printing process, a known number of droplets are produced providing quantitative particle delivery to a variety of substrates. Particular emphasis is placed on the development and characterization of the drying tube in this work.

A notable design feature of the drying tube is the ability to push heated air through the tube rather than the need to pull air from the exit. This provides the ability to place a known number of well-defined particles onto almost any substrate of interest, rather than having to collect particles onto a filter first and then transfer them to another surface. Several types of particles have been produced by this system, examples of which are pure particles of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine ranging from 10 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm in diameter, and ammonium nitrate particles of 40 \u03bcm diameter.

A linear correlation between the fitting parameter k(a) and the measured attachment efficiency was found, suggesting that the RSA model correctly describes the interaction forces dominating the HAdV-2 adsorption.

The results show that the incorporation of CNTs in the PP fibre structure has a considerable impact on the enhancement of piezoelectric properties of the PP filament obtained that the peak voltage generation was almost four fold (from 0.76 V to 2.92 V) when 0.1 wt% of CNTs added into the polymer.

{"title": "Preparation of Macroporous Epitaxial Quartz Films on Silicon by Chemical Solution Deposition.", "abstract": "This work describes the detailed protocol for preparing piezoelectric macroporous epitaxial quartz films on silicon(100) substrates. This is a three-step process based on the preparation of a sol in a one-pot synthesis which is followed by the deposition of a gel film on Si(100) substrates by evaporation induced self-assembly using the dip-coating technique and ends with a thermal treatment of the material to induce the gel crystallization and the growth of the quartz film. The formation of a silica gel is based on the reaction of a tetraethyl orthosilicate and water, catalyzed by HCl, in ethanol. However, the solution contains two additional components that are essential for preparing mesoporous epitaxial quartz films from these silica gels dip-coated on Si. Alkaline earth ions, like Sr(2+) act as glass melting agents that facilitate the crystallization of silica and in combination with cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) amphiphilic template form a phase separation responsible of the macroporosity of the films. The good matching between the quartz and silicon cell parameters is also essential in the stabilization of quartz over other SiO2 polymorphs and is at the origin of the epitaxial growth.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-12-29", "authors": ["Adri\u00e1nCarretero-Genevrier", "Mart\u00edGich"], "doi": "10.3791/53543"}

The transducer is a Langevin type transducer which is composed of an exponential horn, four groups of PZT ceramics and a back beam. The exponential horn can focus the vibration energy, and can enlarge vibration amplitude and velocity efficiently. A bending vibration model of the transducer is first constructed, and subsequently an electromechanical coupling model is constructed based on the vibration model. In order to obtain the most suitable excitation position of the PZT ceramics, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient is optimized by means of the quadratic interpolation method. When the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient reaches the peak value of 42.59%, the optimal excitation position (L1=22.52 mm) is found. The FEM method and the experimental method are used to validate the developed analytical model. Two groups of the FEM model (the Group A center bolt is not considered, and but the Group B center bolt is considered) are constructed and separately compared with the analytical model and the experimental model. Four prototype transducers around the peak value are fabricated and tested to validate the analytical model. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is employed to test the bending vibration shape and resonance frequency. Finally, the electromechanical coupling coefficient is tested indirectly through an impedance analyzer.

Piezoelectric energy harvesters are typically mounted on a vibrating host structure, whereby alternating voltage output is generated by a dynamic strain field. A design target in this case is to match the natural frequency of the harvester to the ambient excitation frequency for the device to operate in resonance mode, thus significantly increasing vibration amplitudes and, as a result, energy output. Other fundamental vibration modes have strain nodes, where the dynamic strain field changes sign in the direction of the cantilever length. The paper reports on a dimensionless numerical transient analysis of a cantilever of a constant cross-section and an optimally-shaped cantilever with the objective to accurately predict the position of a strain node. Total effective strain produced by both cantilevers segmented at the strain node is calculated via transient analysis and compared to the strain output produced by the cantilevers segmented at strain nodes obtained from modal analysis, demonstrating a 7% increase in energy output.

Owing to an intrinsic band gap of 1.2-1.9 eV, monolayer or a-few-layer MoS2 is used for fabricating field effect transistors (FETs) with high electron mobility and on/off ratio. However, the traditional FETs are controlled by an externally supplied gate voltage, which may not be sensitive enough to directly interface with a mechanical stimulus for applications in electronic skin. Here we report a type of top-pressure/force-gated field effect transistors (PGFETs) based on a hybrid structure of a 2D MoS2 flake and 1D ZnO nanowire (NW) array. Once an external pressure is applied, the piezoelectric polarization charges created at the tips of ZnO NWs grown on MoS2 act as a gate voltage to tune/control the source-drain transport property in MoS2. At a 6.25 MPa applied stimulus on a packaged device, the source-drain current can be tuned for \u223c25%, equivalent to the results of applying an extra -5 V back gate voltage. Another type of PGFET with a dielectric layer (Al2O3) sandwiched between MoS2 and ZnO also shows consistent results. A theoretical model is proposed to interpret the received data.

{"title": "Surface Effects and Challenges for Application of Piezoelectric Langasite Substrates in Surface Acoustic Wave Devices Caused by High Temperature Annealing under High Vacuum.", "abstract": "Substrate materials that are high-temperature stable are essential for sensor devices which are applied at high temperatures. Although langasite is suggested as such a material, severe O and Ga diffusion into an O-affine deposited film was observed during annealing at high temperatures under vacuum conditions, leading to a damage of the metallization as well as a change of the properties of the substrate and finally to a failure of the device. Therefore, annealing of bare LGS (La 3 Ga 5 SiO 14 ) substrates at 800 \u2218 C under high vacuum conditions is performed to analyze whether this pretreatment improves the suitability and stability of this material for high temperature applications in vacuum. To reveal the influence of the pretreatment on the subsequently deposited metallization, RuAl thin films are used as they are known to oxidize on LGS at high temperatures.

In our analysis, surface effects are taken into account in terms of the surface elasticity theory and the electrically-shorted conditions are adopted on the free surface of the piezoelectric film and the interface between the film and the substrate. This work focuses on the new features in the dispersion relations of different modes due to surface effects. It is found that with the existence of surface effects, the frequency dispersion of Love waves shows the distinct dependence on the thickness and the surface constants when the film thickness reduces to nanometers. In general, phase velocities of all dispersion modes increase with the decrease of the film thickness and the increase of the surface constants. However, surface effects play different functions in the frequency dispersions of different modes, especially for the first mode dispersion. Moreover, different forms of Love waves are observed in the first mode dispersion, depending on the presence of the surface effects on the surface and the interface.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-12-19", "authors": ["SijiaZhang", "BinGu", "HongbinZhang", "Xi-QiaoFeng", "RongyingPan", "NoneAlamusi", "NingHu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.11.009"}

Third, a bending mode USM is fabricated with a polymer rod and four piezoelectric plates bonded on the rod as a typical example of a USM. Through an experimental investigation of the motor performance, it was found that the polymer-based USMs exhibited higher rotation velocity than the aluminum-based USM under a light preload, although the maximum torque of the polymer-based USMs was smaller than the aluminum-based USM.

{"title": "The performance characteristics of a piezoelectric ultrasonic dental scaler.", "abstract": "The objective of this work was to investigate the performance characteristics of a piezoelectric ultrasonic dental scaler using scanning laser vibrometry. The vibration characteristics of three standard piezoelectric tips were assessed with scanning laser vibrometry under various conditions: unconstrained, under a stream of flowing water, in a water tank, as well as subjected to loads to simulate clinical conditions. Subsequently, the tips were used to disrupt an in-vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, developed using a non-pathogenic Gram-negative species of Serratia (NCIMB40259). The laser vibrometry data showed that the oscillation pattern of the ultrasonic tip depends primarily on its shape and design, as well as on the generator power. Thin tips and high power settings induce the highest vibrations. Water irrigation of the tip and loads influence the tip performance by diminishing its vibration, while water volume increases it. Serratia biofilm was disrupted by the cavitation bubbles occurring around the scaler tip. The most effective biofilm removal occurred with the thinner tip. Understanding how the ultrasonic tip oscillates when in use and how it removes dental plaque is essential for gaining more knowledge regarding the cleaning mechanisms of the ultrasonic system. Cavitation may be used to remove plaque and calculus without a mechanical contact between the dental tip and the teeth. Better knowledge would enable dental specialists to understand and improve their techniques during routine cleaning of teeth.

It has been discovered and rigorously studied using the patch-clamp technique for almost three decades. Its basic role of translating tension applied to the cell membrane into permeability response makes it a strong candidate to function as a mechanoelectrical transducer in artificial membrane-based biomolecular devices. Serving as building blocks to such devices, droplet interface bilayers (DIBs) can be used as a new platform for the incorporation and stimulation of MscL channels. Here, we describe a micropipette-based method to form DIBs and measure the activity of the incorporated MscL channels. This method consists of lipid-encased aqueous droplets anchored to the tips of two opposing (coaxially positioned) borosilicate glass micropipettes. When droplets are brought into contact, a lipid bilayer interface is formed. This technique offers control over the chemical composition and the size of each droplet, as well as the dimensions of the bilayer interface. Having one of the micropipettes attached to a harmonic piezoelectric actuator provides the ability to deliver a desired oscillatory stimulus. Through analysis of the shapes of the droplets during deformation, the tension created at the interface can be estimated. Using this technique, the first activity of MscL channels in a DIB system is reported. Besides MS channels, activities of other types of channels can be studied using this method, proving the multi-functionality of this platform. The method presented here enables the measurement of fundamental membrane properties, provides a greater control over the formation of symmetric and asymmetric membranes, and is an alternative way to stimulate and study mechanosensitive channels.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["Joseph SNajem", "Myles DDunlap", "AnthonyYasmann", "Eric CFreeman", "John WGrant", "SergeiSukharev", "Donald JLeo"], "doi": "10.3791/53362"}

The influences of initial stress on the dispersive relation are considered based on the incremental stress theory. First, the incremental stress theory of elastic solid is extended to the magneto-electro-elasto solid. The governing equations, constitutive equations, and boundary conditions of the incremental stresses in a magneto-electro-elasto solid are derived with consideration of the existence of initial stresses. Then, the transfer matrices of a pre-stressed piezoelectric slab and a pre-stressed piezomagnetic slab are formulated, respectively. The total transfer matrix of a single cell in the phononic crystal is obtained by the multiplication of two transfer matrixes related with two adjacent slabs. Furthermore, the Bloch theorem is used to obtain the dispersive equations of in-plane and anti-plane Bloch waves. The dispersive equations are solved numerically and the numerical results are shown graphically. The oblique propagation and the normal propagation situations are both considered. In the case of normal propagation of elastic waves, the analytical expressions of the dispersion equation are derived and compared with other literatures. The influences of initial stresses, including the normal initial stresses and shear initial stresses, on the dispersive relations are both discussed based on the numerical results.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-12-09", "authors": ["XiaoGuo", "PeijunWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.11.008"}

Dielectric measurements show resonances in some samples between 10-100\u2009kHz. These resonances vanish under thermal anneal in monodomain crystals while they remain stable in periodically poled samples with high domain wall densities. The low activation energy of 0.18\u2009eV suggests their electronic (bi-polaronic) origin. Resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy, RPS, shows two features in virgin samples: a relaxation peak at 420\u2009K and a rapid hardening when the sample was slowly heated to ~500\u2009K. The dynamic relaxation and the hardening are related to excitations and reorientations of Li defects. The relaxations and hardening are irreversibly suppressed by high temperature anneal. We do not observe domain wall related RPS resonances in annealed samples, which excludes the existence of highly charged walls. We suggest that domain walls stabilize polaronic states with (bi-)polarons located inside or near to the ferroelectric domain walls.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

To introduce the unsaturation suitable for chemical grafting, dehydrofluorination of commercially available PVDF-co-HFP was achieved under alkaline medium. Sulfonated copolymer (SCP) was prepared by the free radical copolymerization of dehydofluorinated PVDF-co-HFP (DHPVDF-co-HFP) and AMPS in the presence of free radical initiator. Prepared SCP-based CEMs were analyzed for their morphological characteristics, ion-exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, conductivity, and stabilities (mechanical, chemical, and thermal) in comparison with state-of-art Nafion117 membrane. High bound water content avoids the membrane dehydration, and most optimal (SCP-1.33) membrane exhibited about \u223c2.5-fold high bound water content in comparison with that of Nafion117 membrane. Bunsen reaction of iodine-sulfur (I-S) was successfully performed by direct-contact-mode membrane electrolysis in a two-compartment electrolytic cell using different SCP membranes. High current efficiency (83-99%) confirmed absence of any side reaction and 328.05 kJ mol-H2(-1) energy was required for to produce 1 mol of H2 by electrolytic cell with SCP-1.33 membrane. In spite of low conductivity for reported SCP membrane in comparison with that of Nafion117 membrane, SCP-1.33 membrane was assessed as suitable candidate for electrolysis because of its low-cost nature and excellent stabilities in highly acidic environment may be due to partial fluorinated segments in the membrane structure.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["Ravi PPandey", "Arindam KDas", "Vinod KShahi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b09827"}
{"title": "A Constrained Variable Projection Reconstruction Method for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography Without Accurate Knowledge of Transducer Responses.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging computed imaging modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to form images of the absorbed optical energy density within tissue. When the imaging system employs conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, the ideal photoacoustic (PA) signals are degraded by the transducers' acousto-electric impulse responses (EIRs) during the measurement process. If unaccounted for, this can degrade the accuracy of the reconstructed image. In principle, the effect of the EIRs on the measured PA signals can be ameliorated via deconvolution; images can be reconstructed subsequently by application of a reconstruction method that assumes an idealized EIR. Alternatively, the effect of the EIR can be incorporated into an imaging model and implicitly compensated for during reconstruction. In either case, the efficacy of the correction can be limited by errors in the assumed EIRs. In this work, a joint optimization approach to PACT image reconstruction is proposed for mitigating errors in reconstructed images that are caused by use of an inaccurate EIR. The method exploits the bi-linear nature of the imaging model and seeks to refine the measured EIR during the process of reconstructing the sought-after absorbed optical energy density. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are conducted to investigate the numerical properties of the method and demonstrate its value for mitigating image distortions and enhancing the visibility of fine structures.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["QiweiSheng", "KunWang", "Thomas PMatthews", "JunXia", "LirenZhu", "Lihong VWang", "Mark AAnastasio"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2015.2437356\n10.1201/9780203008997.ch34\n10.1118/1.598688\n10.1118/1.3589141\n10.1121/1.1912541\n10.1121/1.386687\n10.1121/1.1781710\n10.1117/1.2907157\n10.1063/1.3227836\n10.1137/080732213\n10.1137/0710036\n10.1063/1.2195024\n10.1007/978-3-540-68942-3_7\n10.1007/s10589-012-9492-9\n10.1117/1.JBO.17.5.050506\n10.1117/1.3619139\n10.1117/1.3259361"}

The results of a corresponding circuit based on the finite volume model are also compared to the results of a corresponding circuit based on a simplified analytical model for a long piezoelectric plate, and to finite element simulation results for the same plate. It is observed that, for one control volume, the finite volume model corresponding circuit and the simplified analytical model corresponding circuit generate close results. It is also noticed that the results of the two corresponding circuits are different from the best approximation results obtained with high resolution finite element simulations due to the approximations made in the simplified analytical model and the fact that only one finite volume was used in the finite volume model.

Prestin belongs to the SLC26 (solute carrier 26) family of anion transporters and needs anions to function properly, particularly Cl(-). In the present study, using X-ray crystallography we reveal that the STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain of mammalian prestin, considered an 'incomplete' transporter, harbours an unanticipated anion-binding site. In parallel, we present the first crystal structure of a prestin STAS domain from a non-mammalian vertebrate prestin (chicken) that behaves as a 'full' transporter. Notably, in chicken STAS, the anion-binding site is lacking because of a local structural rearrangement, indicating that the presence of the STAS anion-binding site is exclusive to mammalian prestin.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2015-12-05", "authors": ["GrazianoLolli", "ElisaPasqualetto", "ElisaCostanzi", "GretaBonetto", "RobertoBattistutta"], "doi": "10.1042/BJ20151089"}
{"title": "Bismuth Sodium Titanate Based Materials for Piezoelectric Actuators.", "abstract": "The ban of lead in many electronic products and the expectation that, sooner or later, this ban will include the currently exempt piezoelectric ceramics based on Lead-Zirconate-Titanate has motivated many research groups to look for lead-free substitutes. After a short overview on different classes of lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with large strain, this review will focus on Bismuth-Sodium-Titanate and its solid solutions.

{"title": "Development of a Wireless and Passive SAW-Based Chemical Sensor for Organophosphorous Compound Detection.", "abstract": "A new wireless and passive surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based chemical sensor for organophosphorous compound (OC) detection is presented. A 434 MHz reflective delay line configuration composed by single phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs) and three shorted reflectors was fabricated on YZ LiNbO\u2083 piezoelectric substrate as the sensor element. A thin fluoroalcoholpolysiloxane (SXFA) film acted as the sensitive interface deposited onto the SAW propagation path between the second and last reflectors of the SAW device. The first reflector was used for the temperature compensation utilizing the difference method. The adsorption between the SXFA and OC molecules modulates the SAW propagation, especially for the time delay of the SAW, hence, the phase shifts of the reflection peaks from the corresponding reflectors can be used to characterize the target OC. Prior to the sensor fabrication, the coupling of modes (COM) and perturbation theory were utilized to predict the SAW device performance and the gas adsorption. Referring to a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW)-based reader unit, the developed SAW chemical sensor was wirelessly characterized in gas exposure experiments for dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) detection. Sensor performance parameters such as phase sensitivity, repeatability, linearity, and temperature compensation were evaluated experimentally.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-12-04", "authors": ["Fang-QianXu", "WenWang", "Xu-FengXue", "Hao-LiangHu", "Xin-LuLiu", "YongPan"], "doi": "10.3390/s151229793\n10.1021/ar9600749\n10.3390/s150817916\n10.1016/j.aca.2013.05.005\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2464790\n10.1016/j.snb.2006.09.013\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.06.051\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2241052\n10.1016/j.procir.2012.05.001\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2335058\n10.1016/S0957-4158(99)00030-6\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/053\n10.1166/sl.2011.1424\n10.1117/1.3158610\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.02.057\n10.3390/s91209805\n10.1088/0957-4484/21/9/095503\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.10.104\n10.3390/s110201526\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1367486\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.10.018\n10.1021/ac00086a003\n10.1021/cr068109y"}

That is the self-growth of single crystals in Pb-free piezoelectric ceramics. These crystals are several centimeters in size. They are grown without any seed addition through a normal sintering process in modified potassium sodium niobate ceramics.

The composition of the crystals is (K0.4925Na(0.4925-x)Ba(0.015+x/2))Nb(0.995+x)O3 [x is determined by the Na(+) loss, due to Na2O volatilization].

{"title": "Direct Intracochlear Acoustic Stimulation Using a PZT Microactuator.", "abstract": "Combined electric and acoustic stimulation has proven to be an effective strategy to improve hearing in some cochlear implant users. We describe an acoustic microactuator to directly deliver stimuli to the perilymph in the scala tympani. The 800 \u00b5m by 800 \u00b5m actuator has a silicon diaphragm driven by a piezoelectric thin film (e.g., lead-zirconium-titanium oxide or PZT). This device could also be used as a component of a bimodal acoustic-electric electrode array. In the current study, we established a guinea pig model to test the actuator for its ability to deliver auditory signals to the cochlea in vivo. The actuator was placed through the round window of the cochlea. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, peak latencies, and amplitude growth were calculated for an ear canal speaker versus the intracochlear actuator for tone burst stimuli at 4, 8, 16, and 24 kHz. An ABR was obtained after removal of the probe to assess loss of hearing related to the procedure. In some animals, the temporal bone was harvested for histologic analysis of cochlear damage. We show that the device is capable of stimulating ABRs in vivo with latencies and growth functions comparable to stimulation in the ear canal. Further experiments will be necessary to evaluate the efficiency and safety of this modality in long-term auditory stimulation and its ability to be integrated with conventional cochlear implant arrays.", "journal": "Trends in hearing", "date": "2015-12-04", "authors": ["ChuanLuo", "IrinaOmelchenko", "RobertManson", "CarolRobbins", "Elizabeth COesterle", "Guo ZhongCao", "I YShen", "Clifford RHume"], "doi": "10.1177/2331216515616942"}
{"title": "Enhanced performance of PVDF nanocomposite membrane by nanofiber coating: A membrane for sustainable desalination through MD.", "abstract": "Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technique capable of being used in the desalination of marine and brackish water. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) flat sheet nano-composite membranes were surface modified by coating with electro-spun PVDF nano-fibres to increase the surface hydrophobicity. For this purpose, the nano-composite membrane containing 7\u00a0wt.% superhydrophobic SiO2 nano-particles, which showed the highest flux in our previous work, was first subjected to pore size augmentation by increasing the concentration of the pore forming agent (Di-ionized water). Then, the prepared flat sheet membranes were subjected to nanofibres coating by electro-spinning. The uncoated and coated composite fabricated membranes were characterized using contact angle, liquid entry pressure of water, and scanning electron microscopy. The membranes were further tested for 6\u00a0h desalination by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), with a 3.5\u00a0wt.% synthetic NaClaq as the feed. In DCMD the feed liquid and permeate side temperature were maintained at 27.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 15\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. For VMD, the feed liquid temperature was 27\u00a0\u00b0C and a vacuum of 94.8\u00a0kPa was applied on the permeate side. The maximum permeate flux achieved was 3.2\u00a0kg/m(2).h for VMD and 6.5\u00a0kg/m(2).h for DCMD. The salt rejection obtained was higher than 99.98%.

{"title": "Dynamic nozzles for drop generators.", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel mechanism allowing greater control over the formation of droplets is presented. This is achieved via the use of a dynamic nozzle of adjustable diameter. It is demonstrated that, by using such a nozzle, it is possible to greatly modify the formation and breakup of the ligament behind the main drop, leading to an overall reduction in the number of satellite droplets. Furthermore, by adjusting the delay between the beginning of the forming of the drop and the start of the nozzle constriction, a greater control over both the number of satellites and the size of the main drop can be achieved. It is also shown that only a minimal reduction of the nozzle's effective diameter is required in order to exploit the positive effects of the technique presented here. This opens the possibility of incorporating the technique into current droplet generator systems, e.g., via the use of piezoelectric driven nozzles or other micro-mechanical actuation technology.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-12-03", "authors": ["J RCastrej\u00f3n-Pita", "S JWillis", "A ACastrej\u00f3n-Pita"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4934811"}

In our work, both longitudinal and transverse strains were calculated from imaging a bulk sample under a \u00b12 kV/mm electric field. Compared with linear variable displacement transducer data, the results from this correlation method were validated. At the same time, based on this optical technique, different strain-electric field butterfly loops can be drawn from correspondingly selected regions of interest.

{"title": "High yield and ultrafast sources of electrically triggered entangled-photon pairs based on strain-tunable quantum dots.", "abstract": "Triggered sources of entangled photon pairs are key components in most quantum communication protocols. For practical quantum applications, electrical triggering would allow the realization of compact and deterministic sources of entangled photons. Entangled-light-emitting-diodes based on semiconductor quantum dots are among the most promising sources that can potentially address this task. However, entangled-light-emitting-diodes are plagued by a source of randomness, which results in a very low probability of finding quantum dots with sufficiently small fine structure splitting for entangled-photon generation (\u223c10(-2)). Here we introduce strain-tunable entangled-light-emitting-diodes that exploit piezoelectric-induced strains to tune quantum dots for entangled-photon generation. We demonstrate that up to 30% of the quantum dots in strain-tunable entangled-light-emitting-diodes emit polarization-entangled photons.

{"title": "Epitaxial Growth of Thin Ferroelectric Polymer Films on Graphene Layer for Fully Transparent and Flexible Nonvolatile Memory.", "abstract": "Enhancing the device performance of organic memory devices while providing high optical transparency and mechanical flexibility requires an optimized combination of functional materials and smart device architecture design. However, it remains a great challenge to realize fully functional transparent and mechanically durable nonvolatile memory because of the limitations of conventional rigid, opaque metal electrodes. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectric nonvolatile memory devices that use graphene electrodes as the epitaxial growth substrate for crystalline poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) polymer. The strong crystallographic interaction between PVDF-TrFE and graphene results in the orientation of the crystals with distinct symmetry, which is favorable for polarization switching upon the electric field. The epitaxial growth of PVDF-TrFE on a graphene layer thus provides excellent ferroelectric performance with high remnant polarization in metal/ferroelectric polymer/metal devices. Furthermore, a fully transparent and flexible array of ferroelectric field effect transistors was successfully realized by adopting transparent poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] semiconducting polymer.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2015-12-01", "authors": ["Kang LibKim", "WonhoLee", "Sun KakHwang", "Se HunJoo", "Suk ManCho", "GiyoungSong", "Sung HwanCho", "BeomjinJeong", "IhnHwang", "Jong-HyunAhn", "Young-JunYu", "Tae JooShin", "Sang KyuKwak", "Seok JuKang", "CheolminPark"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03882"}

With the increasing attention on all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors, new strategies for high-performance flexible MSCs are highly desired.

The work leads to an areal capacitance of 62.4 mF\u00b7cm(-2) and a volumetric capacitance of 10.4 F\u00b7cm(-3), exceeding that of graphene based flexible MSCs by a factor of 26 and 3, respectively. As a noncarbon based flexible MSC, hierarchically nanostructured WO3 in the narrow finger electrode is essential to such enhancement in energy density due to its pseudocapacitive property.

The phase relationships between forms I, II, and III were ambiguous because they seemed to depend on the heating rate of the DSC and on the history of the samples or they have not been observed at all (equilibrium II-III). In the present paper, piezo-thermal analysis and high-pressure differential thermal analysis have been used to elucidate the positions of the different solid-solid and solid-liquid equilibria. The phase diagram, involving the three solid phases, the liquid phase and the vapor phase, has been constructed. It has been shown that form III is the high-pressure, low-temperature form and the stable form at room temperature. Form II is stable under intermediary conditions and form I is the low pressure, high temperature form, which possesses a stable melting point.

Three different imidazolium-based ionic liquids containing diverse cations and anions have been explored. Structural and electrical properties of the GPEs varying the ZnTf\u2082 concentration are analyzed by ATR-FTIR, DSC, TG, and cyclic voltammetry. Free salt IL-GPEs present distinct behavior because they are influenced by the different IL cations and anions composition. However, inclusion of ZnTf\u2082 salt inside the polymers provide GPEs with very similar characteristics, pointing out that ionic transport properties are principally caused by Zn(2+) and triflate movement. Whatever the IL used, the presence of NMP solvent inside the polymer's matrix turns out to be a key factor for improving the Zn(2+) transport inside the GPE due to the interaction between Zn(2+) cations and carbonyl groups of the NMP. High values of ionic conductivity, low activation energy values, and good voltammetric reversibility obtained regardless of the ionic liquid used enable these GPEs to be applied in Zn batteries.

{"title": "An Inductorless Self-Controlled Rectifier for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "This paper presents a high-efficiency inductorless self-controlled rectifier for piezoelectric energy harvesting. High efficiency is achieved by discharging the piezoelectric device (PD) capacitance each time the current produced by the PD changes polarity.

{"title": "Effect of sonic stimulation on Bacillus endospore germination.", "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of sonic stimulation on Bacillus endospore germination. Germinating endospores in a microtiter plate were exposed to audible sound wave generated by an array of piezoelectric transducers. In situ germination kinetics was measured by terbium-dipicolinate fluorescence assay, optical density measurement and phase contrast microscopy. Fluorescence results revealed that sonic stimulation (5 kHz at 90 dB) promoted the germination speed by 43.7%\u00a0\u00b1 11.3% and final germination level by 61.7% \u00b1 11.9% of Bacillus atrophaeus. This acoustic energy absorbed by endospores is postulated to change membrane permeability and increase enzyme activities; thereby, expediting the germination process. This also raises the likelihood of dormant endospores undergoing germination because of a rapid release of unidentified chemical mediators for quorum sensing. On the other hand, acoustic effect was not observed in B. subtilis endospores. This may be attributed to the different spore aspect ratio, 1.43 \u00b1 0.05 for B. atrophaeus and 2.02 \u00b1 0.08 for B. subtilis, which results in a difference in specific absorption rates towards audible sound waves.

VISTA can detect and quantify the presence of volatile compounds of astrobiological interest, such as water and organics, in planetary samples. These measurements can be particularly relevant when performed on primitive asteroids or comets, or on targets of potential astrobiological interest such as Mars or Jupiter's satellite Europa. VISTA is based on a micro-thermogravimetry technique, widely used in different environments to study absorption and sublimation processes. The instrument core is a piezoelectric crystal microbalance, whose frequency variations are affected by variations of the mass of the deposited sample, due to chemical processes such as sublimation, condensation or absorption/desorption. The low mass (i.e. 40\u00a0g), the low volume (less than 10 cm(3)) and the low power (less than 1\u00a0W) required makes this kind of instrument very suitable for space missions.

This approach was implemented to produce regular stripe arrays with a spacing of 700 nm from vinylidene fluoride co trifluoroethylene ferroelectric copolymer on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. The nanostructures have very stable and switchable piezoelectric response and good crystallinity, and are highly promising for use in organic electronics enhanced or complemented by the unique properties of the ferroelectric polymer, such as bistable polarization, piezoelectric response, pyroelectric response, or electrocaloric function.

Maxillary posterior osteotomy was performed using piezoelectric surgery. To preserve the vascular supply, only 1 vestibular incision was made during surgery. The Mectron Piezosurgery unit is a multipurpose device that uses micrometric ultrasonic piezoelectric vibrations with a variable frequency and cutting energy. The strategy for maxillary osteotomy included 1 horizontal osteotomy, 2 vertical osteotomies, and 1 palatal osteotomy performed transantrally without incision of the mucoperiosteum. The osteotomies were performed using a piezodevice (OT7-type inserts: 0.55 and 0.35\u200amm). In total, 1 horizontal cut (3\u200amm above the roots of the teeth), 2 vertical bone cuts, and 1 palatal osteotomy were made without incision of the palatal mucoperiosteum.Gentle dissection of the buccal fat pad was used to promote the healing of hard and soft tissues in the osteotomized zone.\nNo damage to soft tissues, including the palatal mucosa, occurred. The buccal fat pad was mobilized easily without requiring an additional incision. The osteotomic sites were linear and clean in the palatal aspect. The integrity of the vascular network was maintained because of the lack of damage to the palatal mucosa.

We describe the first label-free real-time ultra-high frequency acoustic wave biosensor prototype capable of detecting the breast and prostate cancer metastasis biomarker, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Two different linkers - 11-trichlorosilyl-undecanoic acid pentafluorophenyl ester (PFP) and S-(11-trichlorosilyl-undecanyl)-benzothiosulfonate (TUBTS) - were used to immobilize whole anti-PTHrP antibodies and Fab' fragments to surfaces as biorecognition elements. The biosensor surfaces were optimized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the ultra-high frequency electromagnetic piezoelectric acoustic sensor (EMPAS). One optimized whole antibody-based surface (PFP/protein G'/whole antibodies/ethanolamine) and one optimized Fab' fragment-based surface (TUBTS/Fab' fragments) were tested as biosensors. It was determined that an in-line injection of bovine serum albumin prior to analyte injection yielded the most minimally fouling surfaces. Each surface was tested with no mass amplification and with sandwich-type secondary antibody mass amplification. The whole antibody-based mass-amplified biosensor yielded the lowest limit of detection (61 ng/mL), highest sensitivity, and a linear range from 61 ng/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL. However, the Fab' fragment-based biosensor displayed better regenerability as a loss of ~20% of the initial analyte signal intensity was observed with each subsequent injection.

The meshes (30\u00d725mm(2)) were overlaid on a full thickness incision (2\u00d71cm(2)) and sutured on the abdominal wall. All animals underwent microCT imaging (res. 35\u00b5m/px) at day 1 and 15 postsurgery. A customized procedure was developed to semi-automatically detect the pore centers from the microCT dataset. Horizontal (transverse) and vertical (cranio-caudal) inter-pore distances were then recorded. The overall mesh dimensions were also noted from 3D models generated from in vivo microCT datasets. Inter-pore distances and the overall dimensions from microCT images of the meshes set in agarose gel phantom were used as controls. Mann-Whitney U test was done to check for significant differences.\nNumber of measurable vertical and horizontal inter-pore distances was 56.5(10.5) and 54.5(14.5) [median (IQR)] per animal. At day 1, we observed a 4.3% (CICAT) and 4.6% (ENDOLAP) increase in vertical inter-pore distance when compared to controls (p<0.001, p=0.003, respectively). Measurements fell back to phantom values by day 15 (3.7% and 4.9% decrease compared to day 1, p<0.001 for both). The horizontal inter-pore distances for ENDOLAP increased by 1.4% (p=0.003) during the two weeks period. The overall mesh dimensions did not change significantly day 1 and day 15.

This study clearly demonstrates the dynamic nature of a textile implant during the tissue integration process.

These dimensions were determined such that there would be an analogous resonant frequency shift ratio in both (1, 1) and (2, 2) modes. By calculating and measuring the resonant frequency, we verified that the resonant frequency of the sensor would change only through contact with the liquid, even the resonant frequency change by only liquid much higher than the changes caused by the nanoparticles. The real signal constituted only 0.017% of the initial resonant frequency. To enhance the sensitivity by reducing the unexpected surface stress in the liquid, the liquid was dropped onto the surface of the micro-diaphragm. This resulted in an improvement of more than 10 times the sensitivity in both modes.

{"title": "Direct-Write, Self-Aligned Electrospinning on Paper for Controllable Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Structures.", "abstract": "Electrospinning, a process that converts a solution or melt droplet into an ejected jet under a high electric field, is a well-established technique to produce one-dimensional (1D) fibers or two-dimensional (2D) randomly arranged fibrous meshes. Nevertheless, the direct electrospinning of fibers into controllable three-dimensional (3D) architectures is still a nascent technology. Here, we apply near-field electrospinning (NFES) to directly write arbitrarily shaped 3D structures through consistent and spatially controlled fiber-by-fiber stacking of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers. An element central to the success of this 3D electrospinning is the use of a printing paper placed on the grounded conductive plate and acting as a fiber collector. Once deposited on the paper, residual solvents from near-field electrospun fibers can infiltrate the paper substrate, enhancing the charge transfer between the deposited fibers and the ground plate via the fibrous network within the paper. Such charge transfer grounds the deposited fibers and turns them into locally fabricated electrical poles, which attract subsequent in-flight fibers to deposit in a self-aligned manner on top of each other. This process enables the design and controlled fabrication of electrospun 3D structures such as grids, walls, hollow cylinders, and other 3D logos. As such, this technique has the potential to advance the existing electrospinning technologies in constructing 3D structures for biomedical, microelectronics, and MEMS/NMES applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-11-26", "authors": ["GuoxiLuo", "Kwok SiongTeh", "YumengLiu", "XiningZang", "ZhiyuWen", "LiweiLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b08909"}

{"title": "Effect of alumina composition and surface integrity in alumina/epoxy composites on the ultrasonic attenuation properties.", "abstract": "We report a method of fabricating backing blocks for ultrasonic imaging transducers, using alumina/epoxy composites. Backing blocks contain scatterers such as alumina particles interspersed in the epoxy matrix for the effective scattering and attenuation of ultrasound. Here, the surface integrity can be an issue, where the composite material may be damaged during machining because of differences in strength, hardness and brittleness of the hard alumina particles and the soft epoxy matrix. Poor surface integrity results in the formation of air cavities between the backing block and the piezoelectric element upon assembly, hence the increased reflection off the backing block and the eventual degradation in image quality. Furthermore, with an issue of poor surface integrity due to machining, it is difficult to increase alumina as scatterers more than a specific mass fraction ratio. In this study, we increased the portion of alumina within epoxy matrix by obtaining an enhanced surface integrity using a net shape fabrication method, and verified that this method could allow us to achieve higher ultrasonic attenuation. Backing blocks were net-shaped with various mass fractions of alumina to characterize the formability and the mechanical properties, including hardness, surface roughness and the internal micro-structure, which were compared with those of machined backing blocks.

Three ultrasonic transducers (piezoelectric transducer, PZT) are integrated in the flow field plate to form the ultrasonic field in the liquid fuel. Ultrasonic frequency, acoustic power, and methanol concentration have been considered as variables in the experiments. With the help of ultrasonic radiation, the maximum output power and limiting current of cell can be independently increased by 30.73% and 40.54%, respectively. The best performance of DMFC is obtained at the condition of ultrasonic radiation (30 kHz and 4 W) fed with 2M methanol solution, because both its limiting current and output power reach their maximum value simultaneously (222 mA and 33.6 mW, respectively) under this condition.

However, the implementation of environmental directives that regulate and control the use of hazardous materials, such as lead, triggered a search for new high-performance lead-free piezoceramics. Recent advances have led to lead-free piezoceramics exhibiting properties similar to PZT, but despite this, reports utilizing these novel piezoceramics in practice are limited. This research employs a modified variant of bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) in a power ultrasonic transducer used for metal welding during the manufacture of semiconductors. The important factors for transducer reliability and performance are investigated, such as piezoceramic aging and stack preload level. It is reported that BNT-based transducers exhibit good stability, and can withstand a stack preload level of 90 MPa without depoling. Although the BNT-based transducers exhibited larger dissipative losses compared to identical PZT8-based transducers, the tool displacement gain was larger under constant current conditions. Semiconductor wire bonds which satisfied the commercial quality control requirements were also formed by this BNT-based transducer.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["AndrewMathieson", "Dominick ADeAngelis"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496216"}

Conventional synthesis routes generally yield crystal size smaller than 2 \u03bcm. We report a flux synthesis method to obtain KCa2Nb3O10 crystals with significantly larger sizes. By using different flux materials (K2SO4 and K2MoO4), crystals with average sizes of 8 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively, were obtained. The KCa2Nb3O10 crystals from K2SO4 and K2MoO4 assisted synthesis were protonated and exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets, and the optimal exfoliation conditions were determined. Using pulsed laser deposition, highly (001)-oriented piezoelectric stacks (SrRuO3/PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3/SrRuO3, SRO/PZT/SRO) were deposited onto Langmuir-Blodgett films of Ca2Nb3O10(-) (CNO) nanosheets with varying lateral nanosheet sizes on Si substrates. The resulting PZT thin films showed high crystallinity irrespective of nanosheet size. The small sized nanosheets yielded a high longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 100 pm/V, while the larger sized sheets had a d33 of 72 pm/V. An enhanced transverse piezoelectric coefficient d31 of -107 pm/V, an important input parameter for the actuation of active structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, was obtained for PZT films grown on CNO nanosheets with large lateral size, while the corresponding value on small sized sheets was -96 pm/V.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["HuiyuYuan", "MinhNguyen", "TomHammer", "GertjanKoster", "GuusRijnders", "Johan Eten Elshof"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b09456"}

Piezoelectric cage-floor sensors have been used to successfully discriminate sleep and wake states in mice based on signal features related to respiration and other movements. This study presents a classifier for noninvasively classifying REM and NREM using a piezoelectric sensor.\nVigilance state was scored manually in 4-s epochs for 24-h EEG/EMG recordings in 20 mice. An unsupervised classifier clustered piezoelectric signal features quantifying movement and respiration into three states: one active; and two inactive with regular and irregular breathing, respectively. These states were hypothesized to correspond to Wake, NREM, and REM, respectively. States predicted by the classifier were compared against manual EEG/EMG scores to test this hypothesis.\nUsing only piezoelectric signal features, an unsupervised classifier distinguished Wake with high (89% sensitivity, 96% specificity) and REM with moderate (73% sensitivity, 75% specificity) accuracy, but NREM with poor sensitivity (51%) and high specificity (96%). The classifier sometimes confused light NREM sleep - characterized by irregular breathing and moderate delta EEG power - with REM. A supervised classifier improved sensitivities to 90, 81, and 67% and all specificities to over 90% for Wake, NREM, and REM, respectively.\nUnlike most actigraphic techniques, which only differentiate sleep from wake, the proposed piezoelectric method further dissects sleep based on breathing regularity into states strongly correlated with REM and NREM.\nThis approach could facilitate large-sample screening for genes influencing different sleep traits, besides drug studies or other manipulations.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["FaridYaghouby", "Kevin DDonohue", "Bruce FO'Hara", "SridharSunderam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.004"}

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the intra- and postoperative events associated with the use of PEDs and conventional rotary instruments for LMSFE.\nThis systematic review was prepared according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The literature was searched for studies comparing the use of PEDs with conventional rotary instruments for LMSFE. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess the studies selected, and meta-analyses were performed using statistical software.\nA total of 124 citations were identified. Of these, four studies with 178 LMSFEs in 120 participants were included. The pooled estimates for the risk of sinus membrane perforation did not show any significant difference between the two surgical techniques (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.91; P = .73). Similarly, no significant difference in implant failure was found after 1 year of functional loading. The overall meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the operating time between the two techniques with more time required for PED.\nThe intra- and postoperative events associated with the use of PEDs and conventional rotary instruments for LMSFE are comparable.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["Momen AAtieh", "Nabeel HmAlsabeeha", "AndrewTawse-Smith", "Clovis MFaggion", "Warwick JDuncan"], "doi": "10.11607/jomi.3895"}
{"title": "Growth of a Novel Nanostructured ZnO Urchin: Control of Cytotoxicity and Dissolution of the ZnO Urchin.", "abstract": "The applications of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires\u00a0(NWs) in implantable wireless devices, such as diagnostic nanobiosensors and nanobiogenerators, have recently attracted enormous attention due to their unique properties. However, for these implantable nanodevices, the biocompatibility and the ability to control the behaviour of cells in contact with ZnO NWs are demanded for the success of these implantable devices, but to date, only a few contrasting results from their biocompatibility can be found. There is a need for more research about the biocompatibility of ZnO nanostructures and the adhesion and viability of cells on the surface of ZnO nanostructures. Here, we introduce synthesis of a new nature-inspired nanostructured ZnO urchin, with the dimensions of the ZnO urchin's acicula being controllable. To examine the biocompatibility and behaviour of cells in contact with the ZnO urchin, the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line was chosen as an in vitro experimental model. The results of the viability assay indicated that, compared to control, the number of viable cells attached to the surface of the ZnO urchin and its surrounding area were reduced. The measurements of the Zn contents of cell media confirmed ZnO dissolution, which suggests that the ZnO dissolution in cell culture medium could lead to cytotoxicity. A purposeful reduction of ZnO cytotoxicity was achieved by surface coating of the ZnO urchin with poly(vinylidene fluorid-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), which changed the material matrix to slow the Zn ion release and consequently reduce the cytotoxicity of the ZnO urchin without reducing its functionality.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["RoghayehImani", "BarbaraDra\u0161ler", "VenoKononenko", "TeaRomih", "KristinaEler\u0161i\u010d", "JanezJelenc", "ItaJunkar", "MajaRem\u0161kar", "DamjanaDrobne", "VeronikaKralj-Igli\u010d", "Ale\u0161Igli\u010d"], "doi": "10.1186/s11671-015-1145-3\n10.1021/nn406134e\n10.1021/nn203070d\n10.1021/nn404838n\n10.1021/am201633x\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1021/nl2034656\n10.1021/nl303132c\n10.1002/adfm.200800541\n10.1038/nnano.2010.46\n10.1021/nl803904b\n10.1038/nature06601\n10.1002/adma.201002519\n10.1002/adma.200904355\n10.1039/C1CS15188F\n10.1021/nn800511k\n10.1021/la203542x\n10.1021/nn300425a\n10.1021/nn403118u\n10.1002/adma.200600200\n10.1021/nn1028482\n10.1021/nn901503q\n10.1021/tx1001892\n10.1021/cr800187m\n10.1021/cr2002933\n10.1039/c3cp54083a\n10.1142/S0219581X12500329\n10.3325/cmj.2012.53.577\n10.1038/nprot.2008.75\n10.1016/j.cossms.2007.03.002\n10.1039/C2CS35164A\n10.5772/58885\n10.1021/jp051078a\n10.1088/0022-3727/37/16/009\n10.1016/j.jlumin.2008.01.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.029\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.055\n10.1039/c4nr00458b\n10.1039/c3nr34251d\n10.1039/c4ra02481h"}

The inclusion criteria were clinical human studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and retrospective studies, with the aim of comparing the piezoelectric surgical osteotomy technique to the standard rotary instrument technique in lower third molar surgery. Postoperative sequelae (oedema, trismus, and pain), the total number of analgesics taken, and the duration of surgery were analyzed. A total of nine articles were included, six RCTs, two CCTs, and one retrospective study. Six studies had a low risk of bias and three had a moderate risk of bias. A statistically significant difference was found between piezoelectric surgery and conventional rotary instrument surgery for lower third molar extraction with regard to postoperative sequelae (oedema, trismus, and pain) and the total number of analgesics taken (P=0.0001, P=0.0001, P<0.00001, and P<0.0001, respectively). However, a statistically significant increased surgery time was required in the piezoelectric osteotomy group (P<0.00001).

Five different ionic liquids were immobilized into a solid polymer electrolyte and key sensor parameters (sensitivity, response/recovery times, hysteresis and limit of detection) were characterized. The study revealed that the sensor based on 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][N(Tf)2]) showed the best sensitivity, fast response/recovery times, and low sensor response hysteresis. The working electrode, deposited from water-based carbon nanotube ink, was prepared by aerosol-jet printing technology. It was observed that the thermal treatment and crystallinity of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the solid polymer electrolyte influenced the sensitivity. Picture analysis of the morphology of the SPE layer based on [EMIM][N(Tf)2] ionic liquid treated under different conditions suggests that the sensor sensitivity strongly depends on the fractal dimension of PVDF spherical objects in SPE.

{"title": "High-power characterization of a microcutter actuated by PMN-PT piezocrystals.", "abstract": "An ultrasonic microcutter is an alternative approach to conventional ultrasonic instruments actuated by sandwich piezoelectric transducers for surgery. This paper reports high-power behavior of a microcutter actuated by the piezocrystal lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT), defining its practical performance and the feasibility of PMNPT actuation for surgical applications. The microcutter was driven at resonance with constant current amplitudes, either unloaded or loaded by poultry breast tissue, until its behavior achieved a steady state. During this driving process, its electric impedance, resonant frequency, and vibration velocity, along with the temperature increase of the PMN-PT, were recorded in real time. The microcutter produced a maximum vibration velocity >2.8 m/s with an excitation current of 0.11 A(rms). The mechanical loss increased significantly with current amplitude, resulting in a maximum temperature increase approaching 50\u00b0C around the interface between the PMN-PT and the blade, where they were bonded together with epoxy. Because of the low phase-transition temperature of PMN-PT, this temperature rise prevented the microcutter from working at higher current amplitudes. Along with the high vibration velocity, it also caused a frequency shift downward by 3 kHz at the same current amplitude. During tests with poultry breast tissue, radiation reactance increased the resonant frequency and the radiation resistance increased the loss of the microcutter. However, the loss did not further increase the temperature of the piezoelectric material. The maximum force and the overall work required to penetrate the microcutter into poultry breast tissue were reduced by 47.1 \u00b1 8% and 53.5 \u00b1 6%, respectively, when the microcutter was actuated at a current of 0.07 A(rms).", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-11-13", "authors": ["YangKuang", "MuhammadSadiq", "SandyCochran", "ZhihongHuang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007300"}

{"title": "How to measure snoring? A comparison of the microphone, cannula and piezoelectric sensor.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare to each other the methods currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) to measure snoring: an acoustic sensor, a piezoelectric sensor and a nasal pressure transducer (cannula). Ten subjects reporting habitual snoring were included in the study, performed at Landspitali-University Hospital, Iceland. Snoring was assessed by listening to the air medium microphone located on a patient's chest, compared to listening to two overhead air medium microphones (stereo) and manual scoring of a piezoelectric sensor and nasal cannula vibrations. The chest audio picked up the highest number of snore events of the different snore sensors. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of scoring snore events from the different sensors was compared to the chest audio: overhead audio (0.78, 0.98), cannula (0.55, 0.67) and piezoelectric sensor (0.78, 0.92), respectively. The chest audio was capable of detecting snore events with lower volume and higher fundamental frequency than the other sensors. The 200 Hz sampling rate of the cannula and piezoelectric sensor was one of their limitations for detecting snore events. The different snore sensors do not measure snore events in the same manner. This lack of consistency will affect future research on the clinical significance of snoring. Standardization of objective snore measurements is therefore needed. Based on this paper, snore measurements should be audio-based and the use of the cannula as a snore sensor be discontinued, but the piezoelectric sensor could possibly be modified for improvement.", "journal": "Journal of sleep research", "date": "2015-11-11", "authors": ["Erna SArnardottir", "BardurIsleifsson", "Jon SAgustsson", "Gunnar ASigurdsson", "Magdalena OSigurgunnarsdottir", "Gudjon TSigur\u0111arson", "GudmundurSaevarsson", "Atli TSveinbjarnarson", "SveinbjornHoskuldsson", "ThorarinnGislason"], "doi": "10.1111/jsr.12356"}

Excellent performance capabilities such as low power and high speed in electronics can be attained through several factors including using functional materials, which sometimes acquire superior electronic properties. The transduction-based transistor switching mechanism is one such possibility, which exploits the change in electrical properties of the transducer as a function of a mechanically induced deformation. Originally developed for deformation sensors, the technique is now moving to the centre stage of the electronic industry as the basis for new transistor concepts to circumvent the gate voltage bottleneck in transistor miniaturization. In issue 37 of Nanotechnology, Chang et al show the piezoelectronic transistor (PET), which uses a fast, low-power mechanical transduction mechanism to propagate an input gate voltage signal into an output resistance modulation. The findings by Chang et al will spur further research into piezoelectric scaling, and the PET fabrication techniques needed to advance this type of device in the future.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2015-11-11", "authors": ["HadiHeidari", "RavinderDahiya"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/26/48/482501"}

{"title": "Guided torsional wave generation of a linear in-plane shear piezoelectric array in metallic pipes.", "abstract": "Cylindrical guided waves based techniques are effective and promising tools for damage detection in long pipes. The essential operations are generation and reception of guided waves in the structures utilizing transducers. A novel in-plane shear (d36 type) PMNT wafer is proposed to generate and receive the guided wave, especially the torsional waves, in metallic pipes. In contrast to the traditional wafer, this wafer will directly introduce in-plane shear deformation when electrical field is conveniently applied through its thickness direction. A single square d36 PMNT wafer is bonded on the surface of the pipe positioned collinearly with its axis, when actuated can predominantly generate torsional (T) waves along the axial direction, circumferential shear horizontal (C-SH) waves along circumferential direction, and other complex cylindrical Lamb-like wave modes along other helical directions simultaneously. While a linear array of finite square size d36 PMNT wafers was equally spaced circumferentially, when actuated simultaneously can nearly uniform axisymmetric torsional waves generate in pipes and non-symmetric wave modes can be suppressed greatly if the number of the d36 PMNT wafer is sufficiently large. This paper first presents the working mechanism of the linear d36 PMNT array from finite element analysis (FEA) by examining the constructive and destructive displacement wavefield phenomena in metallic pipes. Furthermore, since the amplitude of the received fundamental torsional wave signal strongly depends on frequency, a series of experiments are conducted to determine the frequency tuning curve for the torsional wave mode. All results indicate the linear d36 PMNT array has potential for efficiently generating uniform torsional wavefield of the fundamental torsional wave mode, which is more effective in monitoring structural health in metallic pipes.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["WensongZhou", "Fuh-GwoYuan", "TongluShi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.10.021"}

Over the years, these instruments have been refined to minimize damage to the surrounding soft tissues and to maximize precision.\nThis article will present the evolution of the authors' current operative technique based on 185 clinical cases performed over an 19-month period using piezoelectric instrumentation (PEI).\nA two-part study of cadaver dissections and clinical cases was performed using PEI. Evolution of the authors' clinical technique and the operative sequence were recorded.\nThirty cadaver dissections and 185 clinical cases were performed using PEI, including 82 primary and 103 secondary cases. An extended subperiosteal dissection was developed to visualize all aspects of the open rhinoplasty including the osteotomies. Ultrasonic rhinosculpture (URS) was utilized in 95 patients to shape the bony vault without osteotomies. To date, 11 revisions (6%) have been performed. There were no cases of bone asymmetry, irregularity, or excessive narrowing requiring a revision.\nBased on the authors' experience, adoption of PEI is justified and offers more precise analysis and surgical execution with superior results in altering the osseocartilaginous vault. With extensive exposure, surgeons can make an accurate diagnosis of bony deformity and safely contour the bones to achieve narrowing and symmetry of the bony dorsum. Stable osteotomies can be performed under direct vision with precise mobilization and control. As a result of PEI, the upper third of the rhinoplasty operation is no longer shrouded in mystery.

RICS enables the observation of a greater and, thus, more representative area of a biological system as compared to other single molecule approaches. Photothermal microscopy of gold nanoparticles allows long-term imaging of the same labelled molecules without photobleaching. Here, we implement RICS analysis on a photothermal microscope. The imaging of single gold nanoparticles at pixel dwell times short enough for RICS (60\u2009\u03bcs) with a piezo-driven photothermal heterodyne microscope is demonstrated (photothermal raster image correlation spectroscopy, PhRICS). As a proof of principle, PhRICS is used to measure the diffusion coefficient of gold nanoparticles in glycerol\u2009:\u2009water solutions. The diffusion coefficients of the nanoparticles measured by PhRICS are consistent with their size, determined by transmission electron microscopy. PhRICS was then used to probe the diffusion speed of gold nanoparticle-labelled fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) bound to heparan sulfate in the pericellular matrix of live fibroblast cells. The data are consistent with previous single nanoparticle tracking studies of the diffusion of FGF2 on these cells.

Essentially, we demonstrate printing of a wide range of formulations for patient-ready, orodispersible drug dosage forms, without the risk of drug degradation by ink heating and of substrate damages (by contact printing). In addition, our printing process has been optimized to ensure that the drug doses can be loaded onto the orally dissolvable films without introducing defects, such as holes or tears, while retaining a smooth surface texture that promotes patient adherence and allows for uniform post-coatings.

The ASIC addresses the critical challenge of reducing cable count, and includes front-end amplifiers with adjustable gains and micro-beamformer circuits that locally process and combine echo signals received by the elements of each 3 \u00d73 subarray. Thus, an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of receive channels is achieved. Dedicated circuit techniques are employed to meet the strict space and power constraints of TEE probes. The ASIC has been fabricated in a standard 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process and consumes only 0.44 mW/channel. The prototype has been acoustically characterized in a water tank.

{"title": "PVDF Multielement Lamb Wave Sensor for Structural Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "The characteristics of Lamb waves, which are multimodal and dispersive, provide both challenges and opportunities for structural health monitoring (SHM). Methods for nondestructive testing with Lamb waves are well established. For example, mode content can be determined by moving a sensor to different positions and then transforming the spatial-temporal data into the wavenumber-frequency domain. This mode content information is very useful because at every frequency each mode has a unique wavestructure, which is largely responsible for its sensitivity to material damage. Furthermore, mode conversion occurs when the waves interact with damage, making mode content an excellent damage detection feature. However, in SHM, the transducers are typically at fixed locations and are immovable. Here, an affixed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) multielement sensor is shown to provide these same capabilities. The PVDF sensor is bonded directly to the waveguide surface, conforms to curved surfaces, has low mass, low profile, low cost, and minimal influence on passing Lamb waves. While the mode receivability is dictated by the sensor being located on the surface of the waveguide, both symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be detected and group velocities measured.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["BaiyangRen", "Cliff JLissenden"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496423"}

Increasing pressure and decreasing temperature lead to an increase of the proportion of archaeol.

However, conventional or state-of-the-art electroactive materials like lead zirconate titanate, poly(vinylidene fluoride), and carbon nanotube (CNT)-doped polyimides have limitations on use in those extreme applications. Theoretical studies have shown that boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have strength-to-weight ratios comparable to those of CNTs, excellent high-temperature stability (to 800 \u00b0C in air), large electroactive characteristics, and excellent neutron radiation shielding capability. In this study, we demonstrated the experimental electroactive characteristics of BNNTs in novel multifunctional electroactive nanocomposites. Upon application of an external electric field, the 2 wt % BNNT/polyimide composite was found to exhibit electroactive strain composed of a superposition of linear piezoelectric and nonlinear electrostrictive components. When the BNNTs were aligned by stretching the 2 wt % BNNT/polyimide composite, electroactive characteristics increased by about 460% compared to the nonstretched sample. An all-nanotube actuator consisting of a BNNT buckypaper layer between two single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper electrode layers was found to have much larger electroactive properties.

Empowered by the Raman microprobe, the indentation micro-fracture method was found to be capable of providing reliable surface toughness measurements in silicon nitride biomaterials. In designing the microstructures of bioceramic bearing couples for improved tribological performance, surface toughness must be considered as a fundamentally different and distinct parameter from bulk toughness.

{"title": "A novel flexure-based vertical nanopositioning stage with large travel range.", "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a novel flexure-based vertical (or Z-axis) nanopositioning stage driven by a piezoelectric actuator (PZT), which is capable of executing large travel range. The proposed stage consists mainly of a hybrid displacement amplification mechanism (DAM), a motion guiding mechanism, and a decoupling mechanism. The hybrid DAM with amplification ratio of 12.1 is developed to transfer the transverse motion of the PZT actuator into the vertical motion. The motion guiding mechanism is introduced to avoid cross coupling at the output end. The decoupling mechanism can significantly reduce the cross coupling at the driving end to protect the PZT. The stiffness and dynamics of the proposed stage are improved by these mechanisms. Analytical modeling and finite element analysis (FEA) are then adopted to optimize dimensions of the stage. Finally, a prototype of the stage is fabricated and tested for verification. The results of static and dynamic tests show that the proposed stage is capable of vertical travel range of 214 \u03bcm with resolution of 8 nm, and the first two resonance frequencies are 205 Hz and 1206 Hz, respectively. Cross coupling tests under various lateral loads (0 g-1000 g) show that the maximum variances of the lateral and angular cross couplings are less than 0.78 \u03bcm and 95 \u03bcrad, respectively, indicating good decoupling capability.

Verification experiments on standard hardness samples were conducted and the measured hardness values agreed well with those given by a conventional Vickers hardness tester.

{"title": "Autopilot for frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "One of the most challenging aspects of operating an atomic force microscope (AFM) is finding optimal feedback parameters. This statement applies particularly to frequency-modulation AFM (FM-AFM), which utilizes three feedback loops to control the cantilever excitation amplitude, cantilever excitation frequency, and z-piezo extension. These loops are regulated by a set of feedback parameters, tuned by the user to optimize stability, sensitivity, and noise in the imaging process. Optimization of these parameters is difficult due to the coupling between the frequency and z-piezo feedback loops by the non-linear tip-sample interaction. Four proportional-integral (PI) parameters and two lock-in parameters regulating these loops require simultaneous optimization in the presence of a varying unknown tip-sample coupling. Presently, this optimization is done manually in a tedious process of trial and error. Here, we report on the development and implementation of an algorithm that computes the control parameters automatically. The algorithm reads the unperturbed cantilever resonance frequency, its quality factor, and the z-piezo driving signal power spectral density. It analyzes the poles and zeros of the total closed loop transfer function, extracts the unknown tip-sample transfer function, and finds four PI parameters and two lock-in parameters for the frequency and z-piezo control loops that optimize the bandwidth and step response of the total system. Implementation of the algorithm in a home-built AFM shows that the calculated parameters are consistently excellent and rarely require further tweaking by the user. The new algorithm saves the precious time of experienced users, facilitates utilization of FM-AFM by casual users, and removes the main hurdle on the way to fully automated FM-AFM.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-11-02", "authors": ["KfirKuchuk", "ItaiSchlesinger", "UriSivan"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4932939"}

In clinics, it is well known that elevated MMP-9 serum levels are associated with cardiovascular dysfunctions, several aspects of the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system, neuropsychiatric disorders and degenerative diseases related to brain tumors, and excitotoxic/neuroinflammatory processes. Due to the large interest of diagnostics in this protein, efforts to set up sensitive methods to detect MMP-9 for early diagnosis of a number of metabolic alterations are rapidly increasing. In this panorama, biosensors could play a key role; therefore we explored for the first time the development of an aptamer-based piezoelectric biosensor for a sensitive, label free, and real time detection of MMP-9. The detecting strategy involved two different aptamers in a sandwich-like approach able to detect down to 100\u00a0pg\u00a0mL(-1) (1.2 pM) of MMP-9 as detection limit in standard solution. As proof of principle, commercial serum was investigated in terms of possible interferents, their identification and role in MMP-9 detection. The estimated detection limit for MMP-9 is about 560\u00a0pg\u00a0mL(-1) (6.8 pM) in untreated serum.", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "date": "2015-10-31", "authors": ["SScarano", "EDausse", "FCrispo", "J-JToulm\u00e9", "MMinunni"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2015.07.009"}
{"title": "Selective Probing of Gaseous Ammonia Using Red-Emitting Carbon Dots Based on an Interfacial Response Mechanism.", "abstract": "Solid-state fluorescence sensing is one of the most appealing detection techniques because of its simplicity and convenience in practical operation. Herein, we report the development of a red-emitting carbon dots (RCDs)-based material as a solid-state fluorescence sensor for the selective probing of gaseous ammonia. The RCDs were prepared by a low-cost, one-step carbonization method using sugar cane bagasse as the carbon precursor. The pristine RCDs were then directly coated on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane to produce a new fluorescence sensor capable of selectively distinguishing toxic gaseous ammonia from other analyte vapors through sensitive fluorescence quenching with a low detection limit. More importantly, the interfacial response mechanism occurring on the surface of the RCDs has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman measurements. The results indicate that fluorescence quenching in the RCDs might result from ammonia-induced Michael addition through insertion of N into the C=C group and deprotonation of the carboxyl group.

{"title": "Tailor-Made Distribution of Nanoparticles in Blend Structure toward Outstanding Electromagnetic Interference Shielding.", "abstract": "Engineering blend structure with tailor-made distribution of nanoparticles is the prime requisite to obtain materials with extraordinary properties. Herein, a unique strategy of distributing nanoparticles in different phases of a blend structure has resulted in >99% blocking of incoming electromagnetic (EM) radiation. This is accomplished by designing a ternary polymer blend structure using polycarbonate (PC), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to simultaneously improve the structural, electrical, and electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI). The blend structure was made conducting by preferentially localizing the multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) in the PVDF phase. By taking advantage of \"\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking\" MWNTs was noncovalently modified with an imidazolium based ionic liquid (IL). Interestingly, the enhanced dispersion of IL-MWNTs in PVDF improved the electrical conductivity of the blends significantly. While one key requisite to attenuate EM radiation (i.e., electrical conductivity) was achieved using MWNTs, the magnetic properties of the blend structure was tuned by introducing barium ferrite (BaFe) nanoparticles, which can interact with the incoming EM radiation. By suitably modifying the surface of BaFe nanoparticles, we can tailor their localization under the macroscopic processing condition. The precise localization of BaFe nanoparticles in the PC phase, due to nucleophilic substitution reaction, and the MWNTs in the PVDF phase not only improved the conductivity but also facilitated in absorption of the incoming microwave radiation due to synergetic effect from MWNT and BaFe. The shielding effectiveness (SE) was measured in X and Ku band, and an enhanced SE of -37 dB was noted at 18 GHz frequency. PMMA, which acted as an interfacial modifier in PC/PVDF blends further, resulting in a significant enhancement in the mechanical properties besides retaining high SE.

Batch and semi-continuous fermentation processes at 55 \u00b0C were carried out.

The native linear aromatic FF, FFF and aliphatic LL peptide nanoensembles of various shapes (nanotubes and nanospheres) have asymmetric elementary structure and demonstrate nonlinear optical and piezoelectric effects. At elevated temperature, 140-180 \u00b0C, these native supramolecular structures (except for native Cyc-FF nanofibers) undergo an irreversible thermally induced transformation via reassembling into a completely new thermodynamically stable phase having nanowire morphology similar to those of amyloid fibrils. This reconstruction process is followed by deep and similar modification at all levels: macroscopic (morphology), molecular, peptide secondary, and electronic structures. However, original Cyc-FF nanofibers preserve their native physical properties. The self-fabricated supramolecular fibrillar ensembles exhibit the FTIR and CD signatures of new antiparallel \u03b2-sheet secondary folding with intermolecular hydrogen bonds and centrosymmetric structure. In this phase, the \u03b2-sheet nanofibers, irrespective of their native biomolecular origin, do not reveal nonlinear optical and piezoelectric effects, but do exhibit similar profound modification of optoelectronic properties followed by the appearance of visible (blue and green) photoluminescence (PL), which is not observed in the original peptides and their native nanostructures. The observed visible PL effect, ascribed to hydrogen bonds of thermally induced \u03b2-sheet secondary structures, has the same physical origin as that of the fluorescence found recently in amyloid fibrils and can be considered to be an optical signature of \u03b2-sheet structures in both biological and bioinspired materials.

Through a one-step hydrothermal process, a uniform, epitaxial, and spontaneously poled barium titanate (BTO) layer was created on single crystalline TiO2 NWs. Compared to pristine TiO2 NWs, the 5 nm BTO-coated TiO2 NWs achieved 67% photocurrent density enhancement. By numerically calculating the potential distribution across the TiO2/BTO/electrolyte heterojunction and systematically investigating the light absorption, charge injection and separation properties of TiO2 and TiO2/BTO NWs, the PEC performance gain was proved to be a result of the increased charge separation efficiency induced by the ferroelectric polarization of the BTO shell. The ferroelectric polarization could be switched by external electric field poling and yielded PEC performance gain or loss based on the direction of the polarization.

The TEM characterization of the ML composite film demonstrated that the Cu-doped ZnS particles were fully encapsulated by a 500 nm thick Al layer, which acts as an electron source for ML emission. Furthermore, we fabricated a flexible electro-mechanoluminescence (EML) device using a Cu-doped ZnS particles embedded in a flexible elastomer composite film.

{"title": "Evidence of Negative Capacitance in Piezoelectric ZnO Thin Films Sputtered on Interdigital Electrodes.", "abstract": "The scaling paradigm known as Moore's Law, with the shrinking of transistors and their doubling on a chip every two years, is going to reach a painful end. Another less-known paradigm, the so-called Koomey's Law, stating that the computing efficiency doubles every 1.57 years, poses other important challenges, since the efficiency of rechargeable energy sources is substantially constant, and any other evolution is based on device architecture only. How can we still increase the computational power/reduce the power consumption of our electronic environments? A first answer to this question comes from the quest for new functionalities. Within this aim, negative capacitance (NC) is becoming one of the most intriguing and studied phenomena since it can be exploited for reducing the aforementioned limiting effects in the downscaling of electronic devices. Here we report the evidence of negative capacitance in 80 nm thick ZnO thin films sputtered on Au interdigital electrodes (IDEs). Highly (002)-oriented ZnO thin films, with a fine-grained surface nanostructure and the desired chemical composition, are deposited at room temperature on different IDEs structures. Direct-current electrical measurements highlighted the semiconducting nature of ZnO (current density in the order of 1 \u00d7 10(-3) A/cm(2)).

The three ICSI methods tested were conventional ICSI (CI) (using beveled spiked micropipettes with a wall thickness of 1 \u03bcm), conventional Piezo-ICSI (CPI) (using flat-tipped micropipettes with a wall thickness of 0.925 \u03bcm), and improved Piezo-ICSI (IPI) (using flat-tipped micropipettes with a wall thickness of 0.625 \u03bcm). We collectively investigated 2020 mature oocytes retrieved from 437 patients between October 2010 and January 2014.\nThe survival rates after CI, CPI, and IPI were 90, 95, and 99 %, respectively.

However, there still exists some obstacles prohibiting the further improvement of dielectric performance, such as poor interfacial compatibility and low dielectric constant. Therefore, in depth study of the size dependent polarization and surface modification of BT particle is of technological importance in developing high performance BT/PVDF composites. Here, a facile molten-salt synthetic method has been applied to prepare different grain sized BT particles through tailoring the calcination temperature. The size dependent spontaneous polarizationof BT particle was thoroughly investigated by theoretical calculation based on powder X-ray diffraction Rietveld refinement data. The results revealed that 600 nm sized BT particles possess the strong polarization, ascribing to the ferroelectric size effect. Furthermore, the surface of optimal BT particles has been modified by water-soluble polyvinylprrolidone (PVP) agent, and the coated particles exhibited fine core-shell structure and homogeneous dispersion in the PVDF matrix. The dielectric constant of the resulted composites increased significantly, especially, the prepared composite with 40 vol % BT loading exhibited the largest dielectric constant (65, 25 \u00b0C, 1 kHz) compared with the literature values of BT/PVDF at the same concentration of filler. Moreover, the energy storage density of the composites with tailored structure was largely enhanced at the low electric field, showing promising application as dielectric material in energy storage device. Our work suggested that introduction of strong polarized ferroelectric particles with optimal size and construction of core-shell structured coated fillers by PVP in the PVDF matrix are efficacious in improving dielectric performance of composites. The demonstrated approach can also be applied to the design and preparation of other polymers-based nanocomposites filled with ferroelectric particles to achieve desirable dielectric properties.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-10-22", "authors": ["JingFu", "YudongHou", "MupengZheng", "QiaoyiWei", "MankangZhu", "HuiYan"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b05344"}

Motion analysis of the hyoid bone using videofluorography (VF), waveform analysis of the front neck using piezoelectric films, and sEMG of the suprahyoid muscle group were performed simultaneously. Latencies of the three movement phases were defined as upward (VFS1), forward (VFS2), and returning to starting position (VFS3). The three phases of the piezoelectric waveform-from wave initiation of the negative wave to the start of the second deep negative wave; from the start of the second deep negative wave to the start of the last positive wave (SLPW); and from the SLPW to the end of the last positive wave-were defined as PS1, PS2, and PS3, respectively. VFS1-3 and PS1-3 were significantly correlated. VFS1 and PS1 latencies were significantly longer with thick liquid than with thin liquid. VFS2, PS1, and PS2 latencies were longer in the older group than in the other two groups. The start of PS1 was nearly equal to those of sEMG and VFS1.

Polydopamine (PDA) was first prepared by the oxidation and self-polymerization in basic aqueous solution. The obtained PDA was used as an additive in the preparation of PVDF membranes via non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). Then poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), a commonly used zwitterionic polymer, was successfully grafted from the entrapped PDA in membranes through ATRP. The changes in surface morphologies of the PVDF membranes before and after modification were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Data of water contact angle measurements indicated that the surface hydrophilicity of the modified membranes was remarkably improved compared with that of the pure PVDF membrane. Results of filtration tests revealed that the water permeability and antifouling properties of the PVDF membranes were both increased after modification. Moreover, the hemocompatibility of the modified PVDF membrane was greatly improved due to the incorporation of zwitterionic brushes as demonstrated by in vitro platelet adhesion. Owing to the chemical reactivity of polydopamine as well as its strong interactions with a wide spectrum of solid substrates, this strategy can be extended to other materials and allows the development of novel functional membranes through such a blending process and secondary treatments.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

To present the high performance of proposed biosensors, anti-staphylococcus enterotoxin B (anti-SEB) was used as a model to demonstrate the utility of our proposed system. Polymer solution of polyethersolfone was used to fabricate fine nanofibrous membrane. Moreover, industrial polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and conventional microtiter plate were also used to compare the efficiency of antibody immobilization. Scanning electron microscopy images were taken to study the morphology of the membranes. The surface activation of nanofibrous membrane was done with the help of O2 plasma. PES nanofibrous membrane with carboxyl functional groups for covalent attachment of antibodies were treated by EDC/NHS coupling agent. The quantity of antibody immobilization was measured by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) method. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to confirm the covalent immobilization of antibody on membrane. Atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and invert fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze the antibody distribution pattern on solid surfaces. Results show that oxygen plasma treatment effectively increased the amount of antibody immobilization through EDC/NHS coupling chemistry. It was found that the use of nanofibrous membrane causes the improved detection signal of ELISA based biosensors in comparison to the standard assay carried out in the 96-well microtiter plate.

Fluid motion is coupled to structural vibration via a cantilever beam placed in a converging-diverging flow channel. Two designs were considered for the electromechanical coupling: first; the cantilever itself is a piezoelectric bimorph; second; the cantilever is mounted on a pair of flextensional actuators. We experimentally investigated varying the geometry of the flow passage and the flow rate. Experimental results revealed that the power generated from both designs was similar; producing as much as 20 mW at a flow rate of 20 L/min. The bimorph designs were prone to failure at the extremes of flow rates tested. Finite element analysis (FEA) showed fatigue failure was imminent due to stress concentrations near the bimorph's clamped region; and that robustness could be improved with a stepped-joint mounting design. A similar FEA model showed the flextensional-based harvester had a resonant frequency of around 375 Hz and an electromechanical coupling of 0.23 between the cantilever and flextensional actuators in a vacuum.

Traditional rotary cutting instruments are potentially injurious, and piezosurgery, as a new osteotomy technique, has been introduced in oral and maxillofacial surgery. No consistent conclusion has been reached regarding whether this new technique is associated with fewer or less severe postoperative sequelae after third molar extraction.The aim of this study was to compare piezosurgery with rotary osteotomy techniques, with regard to surgery time and the severity of postoperative sequelae, including pain, swelling, and trismus.We conducted a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar.The eligibility criteria of this study included the following: the patients were clearly diagnosed as having impacted mandibular third molars; the patients underwent piezosurgery osteotomy, and in the control group rotary osteotomy techniques, for removing impacted third molars; the outcomes of interest include surgery time, trismus, swelling or pain; the studies are randomized controlled trials.We used random-effects models to calculate the difference in the outcomes, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. We calculated the weighted mean difference if the trials used the same measurement, and a standardized mean difference if otherwise.A total of seven studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis. Compared with rotary osteotomy, patients undergoing piezosurgery experienced longer surgery time (mean difference 4.13 minutes, 95% confidence interval 2.75-5.52, P\u200a<\u200a0.0001). Patients receiving the piezoelectric technique had less swelling at postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (all Ps \u22640.023). Additionally, there was a trend of less postoperative pain and trismus in the piezosurgery groups.The number of included randomized controlled trials and the sample size of each trial were relatively small, double blinding was not possible, and cost analysis was unavailable due to a lack of data.Our meta-analysis indicates that although patients undergoing piezosurgery experienced longer surgery time, they had less postoperative swelling, indicating that piezosurgery is a promising alternative technique for extraction of impacted third molars.", "journal": "Medicine", "date": "2015-10-16", "authors": ["QianJiang", "YatingQiu", "ChiYang", "JingyunYang", "MinjieChen", "ZhiyuanZhang"], "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000001685"}

For each bipolar waveform, fluid was extruded in the form of a stretching liquid column, which eventually retracted into the dispenser orifice. Microdots were obtained by governing the liquid transfer process between the dispenser orifice and the target surface, where the gap was smaller than the maximum extrusion length during liquid column formation. Three fluid behaviors were observed using high-speed imaging, namely extrusion, impact on the target surface, and pinch-off of liquid ligament.

The presence of residual antibiotics in foods and food products of animal origin could pose as health hazards and affect food quality for global acceptance. In this study, the potential of a chloramphenicol sensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coupled with a piezoelectric quartz crystal was explored. The MIP was prepared by precipitation polymerization at 60 \u00b0C. Methacrylic acid was used as monomer, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) as crosslinker, and chloramphenicol as the template. Template removal on the resulting polymer was done by extraction using methanol-acetic acid. Characterization of the MIP and NIP were conducted by spectroscopic and microscopic methods. These further supported the imprinting and rebinding process of chloramphenicol to the polymer matrix. The chloramphenicol sensor was devised by spin-coating onto one side of the 10 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal the MIP suspension in polyvinylchloride-tetrahydrofuran (6:2:1 w/w/v) solution. Optimization of sensor response was performed by varying the type of cross-linker, amount of MIP sensing layer, curing time, and pH. The sensor exhibited good sensitivity of about 73 Hz/log (conc., \u00b5g mL(-1)) and good repeatability (rsd<10%).

Common fabrics and tissues such as polyester, polyamide and leather were used as substrates, representative of base-materials used in the production of jackets or coats. Other samples were prepared by touching the substrate with a silicon finger contaminated with explosives, to simulate a spot left by contaminated hands on a jacket or bag during the preparation of an improvised explosive device (IED) by a terrorist. The observed Raman signals showed some peculiar molecular bands of the analyzed compounds, allowing us to identify and discriminate them with high sensitivity and selectivity, also in presence of the interfering signal from the underlying fabric. A dedicated algorithm was developed to remove noise and fluorescence background from the single laser shot spectra and an automatic spectral recognition procedure was also implemented, evaluating the intensity of the characteristic Raman bands of each explosive and allowing their automatic classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the discrimination potentialities of the apparatus on different sets of explosives and to highlight possible criticalities in the detection.

STOML3 is detected in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. In mouse sensory neurons, depletion of cholesterol and deficiency of STOML3 similarly and interdependently attenuate mechanosensitivity while modulating membrane mechanics. In heterologous systems, intact STOML3 is required to maintain membrane mechanics to sensitize Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels. In C57BL/6N, but not STOML3(-/-) mice, tactile allodynia is attenuated by cholesterol depletion, suggesting that membrane stiffening by STOML3 is essential for mechanical sensitivity.

{"title": "Experiments on Ultrasonic Lubrication Using a Piezoelectrically-assisted Tribometer and Optical Profilometer.", "abstract": "Friction and wear are detrimental to engineered systems. Ultrasonic lubrication is achieved when the interface between two sliding surfaces is vibrated at a frequency above the acoustic range (20 kHz). As a solid-state technology, ultrasonic lubrication can be used where conventional lubricants are unfeasible or undesirable. Further, ultrasonic lubrication allows for electrical modulation of the effective friction coefficient between two sliding surfaces. This property enables adaptive systems that modify their frictional state and associated dynamic response as the operating conditions change. Surface wear can also be reduced through ultrasonic lubrication. We developed a protocol to investigate the dependence of friction force reduction and wear reduction on the linear sliding velocity between ultrasonically lubricated surfaces. A pin-on-disc tribometer was built which differs from commercial units in that a piezoelectric stack is used to vibrate the pin at 22 kHz normal to the rotating disc surface. Friction and wear metrics including effective friction force, volume loss, and surface roughness are measured without and with ultrasonic vibrations at a constant pressure of 1 to 4 MPa and three different sliding velocities: 20.3, 40.6, and 87 mm/sec. An optical profilometer is utilized to characterize the wear surfaces. The effective friction force is reduced by 62% at 20.3 mm/sec. Consistently with existing theories for ultrasonic lubrication, the percent reduction in friction force diminishes with increasing speed, down to 29% friction force reduction at 87 mm/sec.

As expected for lattice ions displaced in an electric field, the proportionality constant is positive for all piezoelectric materials. The exceptions are poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)), which exhibit a negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. Reported explanations exclusively consider contraction with applied electric field of either the crystalline or the amorphous part of these semi-crystalline polymers. To distinguish between these conflicting interpretations, we have performed in situ dynamic X-ray diffraction measurements on P(VDF-TrFE) capacitors. We find that the piezoelectric effect is dominated by the change in lattice constant but, surprisingly, it cannot be accounted for by the polarization-biased electrostrictive contribution of the crystalline part alone.

{"title": "Lead-Free Piezoceramics: Revealing the Role of the Rhombohedral-Tetragonal Phase Coexistence in Enhancement of the Piezoelectric Properties.", "abstract": "Until now, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based ceramics are the most widely used in piezoelectric devices. However, the use of lead is being avoided due to its toxicity and environmental risks. Indeed, the attention in piezoelectric devices has been moved to lead-free ceramics, especially on (K,Na)NbO3-based materials, due to growing environmental concerns. Here we report a systematic evaluation of the effects of the compositional modifications induced by replacement of the B-sites with Sb(5+) ions in 0.96[(K0.48Na0.52)0.95Li0.05Nb1-xSbxO3]-0.04[BaZrO3] lead-free piezoceramics. We show that this compositional design is the driving force for the development of the high piezoelectric properties. So, we find that this phenomenon can be explained by the stabilization of a Rhombohedral-Tetragonal (R-T) phase boundary close to room temperature, that facilities the polarization process of the system and exhibits a significantly high piezoelectric response with a d33 value as high as \u223c400 pC/N, which is comparable to part soft PZTs. As a result, we believe that the general strategy and design principles described in this study open the possibility of obtaining (K,Na)NbO3-based lead-free ceramics with enhanced properties, expanding their application range.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-10-06", "authors": ["FernandoRubio-Marcos", "RigobertoL\u00f3pez-Ju\u00e1rez", "Rocio ERojas-Hernandez", "Adolfodel Campo", "Neftal\u00edRazo-P\u00e9rez", "Jose FFernandez"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b06747"}

The latest improvement includes extra terms related to derivatives of the flexural displacement to provide much accurate solutions for vibrations of the thickness-shear mode, which is the functioning mode of resonators and has much higher frequency than the flexural mode. The improved Lee plate equations have been used in the analysis of high frequency vibrations of quartz crystal plates as an essential step for analysis of AT- and SC-cut quartz crystal resonators after validations with fully electrode quartz crystal piezoelectric plates. In this study, closed-form solutions of free and forced vibrations of SC-cut quartz plates with partial electrodes are obtained. A procedure has been established for the calculation of dispersion relations, frequency spectra, selected vibration modes, and capacitance ratios of forced vibrations. The vibration solutions obtained with the first-order Lee plate equations are proven to be close to solutions from the Mindlin plate equations.

Clinical outcomes included uncorrected near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity (UNVA, UIVA, and UDVA) and patient-assessed task performance in good light and dim light. Statistical analyses assessed the dependencies on preoperative age (45 to 60 years) and preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) (-0.5 to +1.5 diopters [D]). Using the inlay effect derived from wavefront measurements, an eye model was created through which letter charts were simulated.\nThe study evaluated eyes of 188 patients. Postoperative UNVA, UIVA, and task performance at these distances in good light was independent of age and preoperative MRSE (P > .05). Postoperative UDVA was weakly dependent on preoperative MRSE, but distance task performance in good light was not (P > .05). In the treated eye, the mean postoperative UNVA was 20/25, UIVA was 20/25, and UDVA was 20/32. The clinical outcomes are explained by consideration of zones within the pupil generating good near, intermediate, and distance image quality. This was confirmed by visual acuity simulations.\nThe continuous center-near power profile induced by the corneal shape-changing inlay provides good visual acuity and performance from distance through near over a 2.0 D range of preoperative refraction and presbyopic age.\nDrs.

{"title": "Attenuating microwave radiation by absorption through controlled nanoparticle localization in PC/PVDF blends.", "abstract": "Nanoscale ordering in a polymer blend structure is indispensable to obtain materials with tailored properties. It was established here that controlling the arrangement of nanoparticles, with different characteristics, in co-continuous PC/PVDF (polycarbonate/poly(vinylidene fluoride)) blends can result in outstanding microwave absorption (ca. 90%). An excellent reflection loss (RL) of ca. -71 dB was obtained for a model blend structure wherein the conducting (multiwall carbon nanotubes, MWNTs) and the magnetic inclusions (Fe3O4) are localized in PVDF and the dielectric inclusion (barium titanate, BT) is in PC. The MWNTs were modified using polyaniline, which facilitates better charge transport in the blends. Furthermore, by introducing surface active groups on BT nanoparticles and changing the macroscopic processing conditions, the localization of BT nanoparticles can be tailored, otherwise BT nanoparticles would localize in the preferred phase (PVDF). In this study, we have shown that by ordered arrangement of nanoparticles, the incoming EM radiation can be attenuated. For instance, when PANI-MWNTs were localized in PVDF, the shielding was mainly through reflection. Now by localizing the conducting inclusion and the magnetic lossy materials in PVDF and the dielectric materials in PC, an outstanding shielding effectiveness of ca. -37 dB was achieved where shielding was mainly through absorption (ca. 90%). Thus, this study clearly demonstrates that lightweight microwave absorbers can be designed using polymer blends as a tool.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-10-03", "authors": ["SouravBiswas", "Goutam PrasannaKar", "SuryasarathiBose"], "doi": "10.1039/c5cp05189d"}

Such LMs may be clinically significant in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The prevalence and correlation of RRLM in men with OSA were examined.\nA case-control sample of 575 men was selected from all men with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, \u22653% desaturation criteria)\u2009\u2265\u200910 and good data from piezoelectric leg movement sensors at the first in-home sleep study in the MrOS cohort (mean age\u2009=\u200976.8 years). Sleep studies were rescored for RRLMs using five different RRLM definitions varying in both latency of leg movement onset from respiratory event termination and duration of the leg movement. The quartile of RRLM% (the number of RRLM/the number of hypopneas\u2009+\u2009apneas) was derived.\nThe nonparametric densities of RRLM% were most influenced by alterations in the latency rather than the duration of the LM. The most liberal RRLM definition (latency 0-5\u2009s, duration 0.5-10\u2009s) led to a median RRLM% of 23.4 (interquartile range 12.41, 37.12) in this sample. The average AHI and arousal index increased as the quartile of RRLM% increased, as well as the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The prevalence of those with a history of hypertension decreased as RRLM% increased. The non-Caucasian race was associated with lower RRLM%.\nWithin an elderly sample with moderate to severe OSA, piezoelectric-defined RRLM% is associated with a number of sleep-related and demographic factors.

It is shown that the vibration mode shapes remain sufficiently similar to those for uniform plates for a large range of relative dimensions of active and passive laminates of radially nonuniform mechanical systems, and they may be used for calculating transducer parameters. Therefore the transducers can be considered as having a single degree of freedom, and their operational characteristics can be determined using the same technique as previously used for uniform plates. Dependences of the resonance frequencies, effective coupling coefficients, and parameters of the equivalent electromechanical circuit on relative dimensions of active and passive laminates for several combinations of the active and passive materials are presented and compared with those parameters of uniform plates having the same overall dimensions.

However, there exists a significant speed barrier to existing 3D imaging methods, which is associated with the overhead required to image large volumes. This overhead can be overcome to provide nearly unlimited temporal precision by simply focusing on a single molecule or particle via real-time 3D single-particle tracking and the newly developed 3D Multi-resolution Microscopy (3D-MM). Here, we investigate the optical and mechanical limits of real-time 3D single-particle tracking in the context of other methods. In particular, we investigate the use of an optical cantilever for position sensitive detection, finding that this method yields system magnifications of over 3000\u00d7. We also investigate the ideal PID control parameters and their effect on the power spectrum of simulated trajectories. Taken together, these data suggest that the speed limit in real-time 3D single particle-tracking is a result of slow piezoelectric stage response as opposed to optical sensitivity or PID control.", "journal": "Faraday discussions", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["KevinWelsher", "HawYang"], "doi": "10.1039/c5fd00090d"}

In the presented case, a zinc oxide film is deposited by chemical bath deposition on a nearly topography-free template structure composed of a pattern of two self-assembled monolayers with different chemical functionality. We demonstrate the template-modulated morphological properties of the growing film, as the surface functionality dictates the granularity of the growing film. This, in turn, is a key property influencing other film properties such as conductivity, piezoelectric activity and the mechanical properties. A very pronounced contrast is observed between areas with an underlying fluorinated, low energy template surface, showing a much more (almost two orders of magnitude) coarse-grained film with a typical agglomerate size of around 75 nm. In contrast, amino-functionalized surface areas induce the growth of a very smooth, fine-grained surface with a roughness of around 1 nm. The observed influence of the template on the resulting clear contrast in morphology of the growing film could be explained by a contrast in surface adhesion energies and surface diffusion rates of the nanoparticles, which nucleate in solution and subsequently deposit on the functionalized substrate.", "journal": "Beilstein journal of nanotechnology", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["Nina JBlumenstein", "JonathanBerson", "StefanWalheim", "PetiaAtanasova", "JohannesBaier", "JoachimBill", "ThomasSchimmel"], "doi": "10.3762/bjnano.6.180\n10.1002/adma.201401485\n10.1016/j.cej.2014.10.001\n10.1021/la903636k\n10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2007.11.030\n10.1021/la703919w\n10.1063/1.117916\n10.1524/zkri.2012.1479\n10.1002/ejic.201201029\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.10.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.007\n10.3762/bjnano.5.65\n10.3762/bjnano.5.193\n10.1039/C3CE41701H\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.11.019\n10.3762/bjnano.5.132\n10.1021/jp962918b\n10.1016/j.aca.2012.05.048\n10.1109/JPROC.2010.2044550\n10.3762/bjnano.5.16\n10.1016/S0040-6090(00)01787-9\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/32/325706\n10.1063/1.367959\n10.1088/0953-8984/16/25/R01\n10.1002/1616-3028(20020517)12:5<323::AID-ADFM323>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1016/j.physe.2014.01.032\n10.1021/cm051542o\n10.2109/jcersj.114.911\n10.1039/b902044f\n10.1021/la049247q\n10.1016/S0040-6090(98)00579-3\n10.1016/j.tsf.2006.04.006\n10.3762/bjnano.3.71"}

Inspired by the multiple functionalities of the ubiquitous lateral-line sensors of fishes, we developed flexible and surface-mountable arrays of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) artificial hair cell flow sensors. This paper reports the development of the MEMS artificial versions of superficial and canal neuromasts and experimental characterization of their unique flow-sensing roles. Our MEMS flow sensors feature a stereolithographically fabricated polymer hair cell mounted on Pb(Zr(0.52)Ti(0.48))O3 micro-diaphragm with floating bottom electrode. Canal-inspired versions are developed by mounting a polymer canal with pores that guide external flows to the hair cells embedded in the canal. Experimental results conducted employing our MEMS artificial superficial neuromasts (SNs) demonstrated a high sensitivity and very low threshold detection limit of 22 mV/(mm s(-1)) and 8.2 \u00b5m s(-1), respectively, for an oscillating dipole stimulus vibrating at 35 Hz.

In this work, we present micro-power generators that harvest energy from the disc's rotational movement to power biomedical applications on the disc. To implement these ideas, we developed two types of micro-power generators using piezoelectric films and an electromagnetic induction system. The piezoelectric-based generator takes advantage of the film's vibration during the disc's rotational motion, whereas the electromagnetic induction-based generator operates on the principle of current generation in stacks of coil exposed to varying magnetic flux. We have successfully demonstrated that at the spinning speed of 800 revolutions per minute (RPM) the piezoelectric film-based generator is able to produce up to 24 microwatts using 6 sets of films and the magnetic induction-based generator is capable of producing up to 125 milliwatts using 6 stacks of coil. As a proof of concept, a custom made localized heating system was constructed to test the capability of the magnetic induction-based generator. The heating system was able to achieve a temperature of 58.62 \u00b0C at 2200 RPM.

{"title": "Efficient Driving of Piezoelectric Transducers Using a Biaxial Driving Technique.", "abstract": "Efficient driving of piezoelectric materials is desirable when operating transducers for biomedical applications such as high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or ultrasound imaging. More efficient operation reduces the electric power required to produce the desired bioeffect or contrast. Our preliminary work [Cole et al. Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter. 2014;26(13):135901.] suggested that driving transducers by applying orthogonal electric fields can significantly reduce the coercivity that opposes ferroelectric switching. We present here the experimental validation of this biaxial driving technique using piezoelectric ceramics typically used in HIFU. A set of narrow-band transducers was fabricated with two sets of electrodes placed in an orthogonal configuration (following the propagation and the lateral mode). The geometry of the ceramic was chosen to have a resonance frequency similar for the propagation and the lateral mode. The average (\u00b1 s.d.) resonance frequency of the samples was 465.1 (\u00b1 1.5) kHz. Experiments were conducted in which each pair of electrodes was driven independently and measurements of effective acoustic power were obtained using the radiation force method. The efficiency (acoustic/electric power) of the biaxial driving method was compared to the results obtained when driving the ceramic using electrodes placed only in the pole direction. Our results indicate that the biaxial method increases efficiency from 50% to 125% relative to the using a single electric field.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-09-30", "authors": ["SamuelPichardo", "Rafael R CSilva", "OlegRubel", "LauraCuriel"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0139178\n10.1016/j.cpc.2012.10.028\n10.1088/0965-0393/22/5/055014\n10.1103/PhysRev.136.B864\n10.1103/PhysRev.140.A1133\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00076-1\n10.1109/58.896144\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1304268\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3891\n10.1103/PhysRevB.84.115107\n10.1103/PhysRevB.86.155138\n10.1038/35002022\n10.1103/PhysRevB.72.064107\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1320748"}

The Ni-Cr-composite specimens were divided into 7 groups of 12 specimens each based upon the procedure used for removing the excess cement. For Group 1 (Co) specimens the excess cement was removed with microbrushes immediately after cementation. Groups 2 through 7 were based on the use of vibrating instrument and the time period after which the excess material was removed. These included the cement, Panavia 21, three vibrating instruments, Sonic with a universal tip (So), Piezoelectric ultrasonic with a USPIS tip (Pu), Magnetorestrive ultrasonic with a FS1-100 tip (Mu) and two different time periods, soon after cementation (9m) and one hour after cementation (1h). Once excess cement REMOVAL WAS COMPLETED, THE SPECIMENS WERE SUBJECTED TO SHEAR TESTING.\nMean Shear Bond strengths ranged from 16.03 MPa (Co) to 19.91 MPa (So 1h). Statistical analysis demonstrated that interaction of the main effects were significant (F = 4.27, p = 0.042). Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the effect of timing was significant in all the instrumented groups. The majority of the tested specimens failed cohesively compared to mainly adhesive failures for the control group.\nThe effect of type of instrumentation immediately following polymerization setting had no effect on the shear bond strengths however a delay of 1 hour for all types of instrumentation had a beneficial effect of improving observed shear bond strengths.", "journal": "The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry", "date": "2015-09-30", "authors": ["Shivaughn MMarchan", "DanielWhite", "WilliamSmith", "VirendraDhuru"], "doi": null}

The very low Q-factor is the most intriguing PN property among the piezoelectric materials, and as shown in this research, this internal high dissipation and damping effect is directly related to the presence of silicon oil in the porous PN structure; consequently, it is dependent on the oil properties. To the contrary, the quality factor of PN not saturated with oil was found to be as high as nearly 400. Full sets of PN electro-mechanical constants, transient resonance and dissipation characteristics, and their temperature dependencies were determined under both conditions: PN conventionally saturated with oil and PN not saturated with oil. As was experimentally shown, at higher temperatures particularly after a 260\u00b0C soak for several days, a transition from the \"with oil\" state to the \"no oil\" state takes place in the conventional PN properties; this effect is a consequence of the phase transition in the silicon oil from liquid to solid state.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-09-29", "authors": ["AlexMezheritsky"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007088"}

{"title": "Recent Advances in Nonpolar and Semipolar InGaN Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs).", "abstract": "The III-nitrides have attracted much attention because of their applicability in optoelectronic devices, whose emission wavelengths range from green to ultraviolet light due to their wide band gap. However, conventional c-plane GaN-based devices are influenced significantly by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effects, which could pose a limitation for increased luminous efficiency as a result of the quantum confined stark effect. Since the early 2000s, many groups have tried to solve these problems by examining the growth of GaN on non- or semipolar surface planes. High power non- and semipolar LEDs can be realized by the growth of a thick active layer. In addition, it is expected that it is possible to grow nonpolar InGaN LEDs with high quality p-GaN layers due to lower hole activation energy, and also long-wavelength semipolar InGaN LEDs because of the capacity for high indium incorporation in the quantum wells (QWs). However, non- and semipolar structures grown on sapphire substrate usually contain a high density of basal stacking faults and threading dislocations. For this reason, the growth of non- and semipolar GaN-based LEDs on a sapphire substrate has been attempted through the introduction of defect reduction techniques such as epitaxial lateral overgrowth, patterned sapphire substrate and re-growth techniques on a porous GaN layer, etc. Also, some researchers have grown high quality non- and semipolar GaN-based LEDs using non- and semipolar freestanding GaN substrates.

Four piezoelectric crystals were implanted via laparotomy into the myometrium of the pregnant uterine horn of 12 pluriparous Holstein Friesian cows 3 weeks before the calculated calving date. Sonometric measurements were conducted daily from 2 days before parturition (= Day 0) until Day 14 after calving and then every other day until Day 28. Distances between adjacent crystals were expressed in relation to reference values obtained before calving. The diameter of the formerly pregnant uterine horn was measured using transrectal B-Mode sonography starting on Day 10. Cows were retrospectively divided into the following groups: cows without metritis (M-; n = 7), cows with metritis (M+; n = 5), cows with normocalcemia (SH-; Ca > 2.0 mmol/l on Days 1 to 3; n = 5) and cows with subclinical hypocalcemia (SH+; Ca < 2.0 mmol/l in at least one sample between Days 1 and 3; n = 7). Metritis did not affect (P > 0.05) sonometric measurements, but the diameter of the formerly pregnant horn was larger (P \u2264 0.05) between Days 15 and 21 in M+ cows than in M\u2012 cows. Reduction in uterine length in hypocalcemic cows was delayed (P \u2264 0.05) between Days 8 and 21 compared with normocalcemic cows, but the uterine horn diameter was not related to calcium status. In conclusion, both diseases affected reduction of uterine size until Day 28. Cows with metritis had a larger uterine diameter, possibly attributable to accumulation of lochia, and cows with subclinical hypocalcemia had delayed reduction of uterine length, presumably related to reduction of myometrial contractility.", "journal": "The Journal of reproduction and development", "date": "2015-09-25", "authors": ["MaikeHeppelmann", "KarolineKrach", "LarsKrueger", "PhilippBenz", "KathrinHerzog", "MarionPiechotta", "MartinaHoedemaker", "HeinrichBollwein"], "doi": "10.1262/jrd.2015-015"}

In this paper, we have introduced an impact-based droplet printing platform utilizing a simple plug-and-play microfluidic cartridge driven by piezoelectric actuators. Such a customizable printing system allows for ultrafine control of droplet volume from picoliters (\u223c23 pl) to nanoliters (\u223c10 nl), a 500 fold variation. The high flexibility of droplet generation can be simply achieved by controlling the magnitude of actuation (e.g., driving voltage) and the waveform shape of actuation pulses, in addition to nozzle size restrictions. Detailed printing characterizations on these parameters have been conducted consecutively. A multiplexed impact printing system has been prototyped and demonstrated to provide the functions of single-droplet jetting and droplet multiplexing as well as concentration gradient generation. Moreover, a generic biological assay has also been tested and validated on this printing platform.

These applications require arrays of many small elements to selectively record the sound waves coming from a certain direction. Here we present proof of concept of an optical micro-machined ultrasound sensor (OMUS) fabricated with a semi-industrial CMOS fabrication line. The sensor is based on integrated photonics, which allows for elements with small spatial footprint. We demonstrate that the first prototype is already capable of detecting pressures of 0.4 Pa, which matches the performance of the state of the art piezo-electric transducers while having a 65 times smaller spatial footprint. The sensor is compatible with MRI due to the lack of electronical wiring. Another important benefit of the use of integrated photonics is the easy interrogation of an array of elements. Hence, in future designs only two optical fibers are needed to interrogate an entire array, which minimizes the amount of connections of smart catheters.

Here we use low doses of argon bombardment to remove surface contamination and make reproducible lower resistance contacts. Higher doses strip the surface of the nanorods allowing intrinsic surface measurements through a cross section of the material. Photoluminescence finds that the defect distribution is higher at the near-surface, falling away in to the bulk. Contacts to the n-type defect-rich surface are near-Ohmic, whereas stripping away the surface layers allows more rectifying Schottky contacts to be formed.

The resultant ZnO nanorods with uniform shape and length align vertically on the template, while their density is easily tunable by adjusting the density of GaN QDs, which can be adjusted by simply varying growth interruption.

Piezo1 forms a trimeric propeller-like structure (about 900 kilodalton), with the extracellular domains resembling three distal blades and a central cap. The transmembrane region has 14 apparently resolved segments per subunit. These segments form three peripheral wings and a central pore module that encloses a potential ion-conducting pore.

In the proposed device, the film sensor converts in-ear pulse waves (EPW) into electrical current, and the circuit module enhances the EPW and suppresses noise. A real-time algorithm embedded in the circuit module performs morphological conversions to make the EPW more distinct and knowledge-based rules are used to detect EPW peaks. In a clinical experiment conducted using a reference electrocardiogram (ECG) device, EPW and ECG were concurrently recorded from 58 healthy subjects. The EPW intervals between successive peaks and their corresponding ECG intervals were then compared to each other. Promising results were obtained from the samples, specifically, a sensitivity of 97.25%, positive predictive value of 97.17%, and mean absolute difference of 0.62.

In this work, new lead-free multifunctional ceramics of Ca1-x(LiHo)x/2Bi4Ti4O15 were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The great multi-improvement in ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity, down/up-conversion luminescence and temperature stability of the multifunctional properties is induced by the partial substitution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) for Ca(2+) ions in CaBi4Ti4O15. All the ceramics possess a bismuth-layer structure, and the crystal structure of the ceramics is changed from a four layered bismuth-layer structure to a three-layered structure with the level of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) increasing. The ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits simultaneously, high resistivity (R = 4.51 \u00d7 10(11)\u03a9 cm), good piezoelectricity (d33 = 10.2 pC N(-1)), high Curie temperature (TC = 814 \u00b0C), strong ferroelectricity (Pr = 9.03 \u03bcC cm(-2)) and enhanced luminescence. These behaviours are greatly associated with the contribution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) in the ceramics. Under the excitation of 451 nm light, the ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits a strong green emission peak centered at 545 nm, corresponding to the transition of the (5)S2\u2192(5)I8 level in Ho(3+) ions, while a strong red up-conversion emission band located at 660 nm is observed under the near-infrared excitation of 980 nm at room temperature, arising from the transition of (5)F5\u2192(5)I8 levels in Ho(3+) ions. Surprisingly, the excellent temperature stability of ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity/luminescence and superior water-resistance behaviors of piezoelectricity/luminescence are also obtained in the ceramic with x = 0.1.

Previously, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers were produced either using near-field electrospinning (spinning distance<1 cm) or conventional electrospinning (spinning distance>8 cm). PVDF fibers produced by an electrospinning at a spinning distance between 1 and 8 cm (referred to as \"short-distance\" electrospinning in this paper) has received little attention. In this study, we have found that PVDF electrospun in such a distance range can still be fibers, although interfiber connection is formed throughout the web. The interconnected PVDF fibers can have a comparable \u03b2 crystal phase content and mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion property to those produced by conventional electrospinning. However, the interfiber connection was found to considerably stabilize the fibrous structure during repeated compression and decompression for electrical conversion. More interestingly, the short-distance electrospun PVDF fiber webs have higher delamination resistance and tensile strength than those of PVDF nanofiber webs produced by conventional electrospinning. Short-distance electrospun PVDF nanofibers could be more suitable for the development of robust energy harvesters than conventionally electrospun PVDF nanofibers.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-09-18", "authors": ["HaoShao", "JianFang", "HongxiaWang", "ChenhongLang", "TongLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b06863"}

The nanomagnets are first magnetized with a magnetic field directed along their nominal major axes.

The rotated magnetizations remain in their new orientations after the field is removed, resulting in 'non-volatility'. In isolated nanomagnets, the magnetization rotates by <90\u00b0 upon application of the electric field, but in a dipole-coupled pair consisting of one 'hard' and one 'soft' nanomagnet, which are both initially magnetized in the same direction by the magnetic field, the soft nanomagnet's magnetization rotates by [Formula: see text] upon application of the electric field because of the dipole influence of the hard nanomagnet.

By thinning the sapphire substrate to 50 \u00b5m, it was found that the LED exhibited the highest light output power of ~48 mW under high injection current of 50 mA, improved by about 35% compared to that with 200 \u00b5m-thick sapphire without increasing the operating voltage. The electroluminescence intensity was increased and the spectral peak wavelength was blue-shifted, because the wafer bowing-induced mechanical stress alters the piezoelectric field in the InGaN/GaN MQW active region of the LED. The internal quantum efficiency was also improved by about 10% at an injection current of 50 mA. Moreover, the external quantum efficiency and light extraction efficiency were optimized because of enhanced light output intensity.

Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterials has been found to be highly attractive, because of the remarkable potential for applications in many different areas such as solar cells, sensors, piezoelectric devices, photodiode devices, sun screens, antireflection coatings, and photocatalysis. Here, we present an innovative approach to create a new modified textile by direct in situ growth of vertically aligned one-dimensional (1D) ZnO NRs onto textile surfaces, which can serve with potential for biosensing, photocatalysis, and antibacterial applications. ZnO NRs were grown by using a simple aqueous chemical growth method. Results from analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the ZnO NRs were dispersed over the entire surface of the textile. We have demonstrated the following applications of these multifunctional textiles: (1) as a flexible working electrode for the detection of aldicarb (ALD) pesticide, (2) as a photocatalyst for the degradation of organic molecules (i.e., Methylene Blue and Congo Red), and (3) as antibacterial agents against Escherichia coli. The ZnO-based textile exhibited excellent photocatalytic and antibacterial activities, and it showed a promising sensing response. The combination of sensing, photocatalysis, and antibacterial properties provided by the ZnO NRs brings us closer to the concept of smart textiles for wearable sensing without a deodorant and antibacterial control. Perhaps the best known of the products that is available in markets for such purposes are textiles with silver nanoparticles.

Benefiting from the utilization of SiO2 NPs with three different particle sizes, the electrospun nanofibrous membranes (ENMs) were endowed with three different delicate nanofiber morphologies and fiber diameter distribution, high porosity, and superhydrophobic property, which resulted in excellent waterproofing and breathability. Significantly, structural attributes analyses have indicated the major contributing role of fiber diameter distribution on determining the augment of permeate vapor flux through regulating mean flow pore size (MFP).

Using the first principles calculations, we investigate the size-dependent and strain-tunable transport behavior in the tunnel junctions. It was confirmed that external strain has strong control over the transport properties of ZnO tunnel junctions, with several times amplification of tunnel conductance obtained by strain reversal. More importantly, the conductance amplification by strain reversal exponentially changes with the barrier thickness, indicating the size-dependent strain tunability of the transport behavior. The electrostatic quantities (i.e., built-in field, depolarization field, polarization, interfacial dipoles and potential barrier) and the transport properties of tunnel junctions were comprehensively analyzed to reveal the relationships between these quantities and their size dependence. The exponential size-dependence of strain tunable transport behavior in ZnO tunnel junctions is attributed to the linear change in the potential barrier with the barrier thickness. Our simulations provide an insight of how to maximize the strain tunability of transport behavior of piezoelectric tunnel junctions by thickness design and strain engineering.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-09-16", "authors": ["JiaZhu", "W JChen", "G HZhang", "YueZheng"], "doi": "10.1039/c5cp03945b"}

Localized SBs is introduced by Au NPs decoration. The negatively charged Au NPs deplete more carriers near the ZnO surface, which raises the SB height and sharply reduces the recover time of the PD from 142.4 s to 0.7 s. Moreover, after applying the compressive strain, the band structure of ZnO MW changes and piezoelectric potential generates, which further raises the SB height, thickens the depletion region and improves photo-response properties of the detector. The dark current is reduced by about 5 orders and its on/off current ratio increased by about 6 orders, which decreases the power consumption of the detector significantly. Under the above coupling effect between piezoelectric potential and localized SBs, the recover time of the detector is further reduced to 0.1 s ultimately.

Furthermore, a comparative analysis reveals that the pulse-picking-induced additional amplitude noise is minimized, when the AOM is operated under synchronicity.

{"title": "Multiplexing of fiber-optic ultrasound sensors via swept frequency interferometry.", "abstract": "The use of fiber-optic sensors for ultrasound (US) detection has many advantages over conventional piezoelectric detectors. However, the issue of multiplexing remains a major challenge. Here, a novel approach for multiplexing fiber-optic based US sensors using swept frequency interferometry is introduced. Light from a coherent swept source propagates in an all-fiber interferometric network made of a reference arm and a parallel connection of N sensing arms. Each sensing arm comprises a short polyimide coated sensing section (~4cm), which is exposed to the US excitation, preceded by a delay of different length. When the instantaneous frequency of the laser is linearly swept, the receiver output contains N harmonic beat components which correspond to the various optical paths. Exposing the sensing sections to US excitation introduces phase modulation of the harmonic components. The US-induced signals can be separated in the frequency domain and be extracted from their carriers by common demodulation techniques. The method was demonstrated by multiplexing 4 sensing fibers and detecting microsecond US pulses which were generated by a 2.25MHz ultrasound transducer. The pulses were successfully measured by all sensing fibers without noticeable cross-talk.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2015-09-15", "authors": ["HanielGabai", "IdanSteinberg", "AvishayEyal"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.23.018915"}

Utilizing strain-induced piezoelectric polarization charges to modulate the energy band structures and thus to tune/control the transport processes of charge carriers is referred to as the piezotronic effect. Distinct from the previous studies of c-axis GaN nanowires, here we systematically study the piezotronic-effect-induced modifications of energy band structures and the corresponding influence on electronic transport properties of a-axis GaN nanobelts. The physical mechanism is carefully illustrated and further confirmed by theoretical simulations via finite element analysis. The spatial distributions of local carrier concentration and the energy band diagrams of a-axis GaN under various straining conditions are calculated.

{"title": "Piezo1 regulates mechanotransductive release of ATP from human RBCs.", "abstract": "Piezo proteins (Piezo1 and Piezo2) are recently identified mechanically activated cation channels in eukaryotic cells and associated with physiological responses to touch, pressure, and stretch. In particular, human RBCs express Piezo1 on their membranes, and mutations of Piezo1 have been linked to hereditary xerocytosis. To date, however, physiological functions of Piezo1 on normal RBCs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Piezo1 regulates mechanotransductive release of ATP from human RBCs by controlling the shear-induced calcium (Ca(2+)) influx. We find that, in human RBCs treated with Piezo1 inhibitors or having mutant Piezo1 channels, the amounts of shear-induced ATP release and Ca(2+) influx decrease significantly. Remarkably, a critical extracellular Ca(2+) concentration is required to trigger significant ATP release, but membrane-associated ATP pools in RBCs also contribute to the release of ATP. Our results show how Piezo1 channels are likely to function in normal RBCs and suggest a previously unidentified mechanotransductive pathway in ATP release.

A compact parallel mechanism for grasping and releasing microobjects is used to generate controllable vibration to overcome the strong adhesion forces between the end effector and the manipulated object. To reach the required acceleration of the end effector, which is necessary for the detachment of the target object by overcoming adhesion forces, vibration in the end effector is generated by applying sinusoidal voltage to the PZT actuator of the parallel mechanism. For the necessary acceleration, we focus on the possible range of the frequency of the PZT-actuator-induced vibration, while minimizing the amplitude of the vibration (14 nm) to achieve precise positioning. The effect of the air and liquid environments on the required vibration frequency for successful release is investigated.

The acoustic time-of-flight for each crystal cut was measured when applying direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), and pulsed voltages. Results show that the voltage-induced shift in the acoustic wave propagation time scaled quadratically with voltage for DC and AC voltages applied to X-cut crystals. For the Y + 36\u00b0 crystal, the voltage-induced shift scales linearly with DC voltages and quadratically with AC voltages. When applying 5 \u03bcs voltage pulses to both crystals, the voltage-induced shift scaled linearly with voltage. For the Y + 36\u00b0 cut, the voltage-induced shift from applying DC voltages ranged from 10 to 54 ps and 35 to 778 ps for AC voltages at 640 V over the frequency range of 100 Hz-100 kHz. Using the same conditions as the Y + 36\u00b0 cut, the 0\u00b0 X-cut crystal sensed a shift of 10-273 ps for DC voltages and 189-813 ps for AC voltage application.

The prototype is based on two piezo nano-steppers coupled to three linear micro-stages to cover a large scale operation from micrometers to centimeters. The operation mode consists of a spring probe biased at low DC voltage with respect to a grounded conductive layer. The tip slides on the target layer keeping contact with the material in room conditions, allowing continuous electric monitoring of the process, and also real-time tilt correction via software. The sliding tip leaves an insulating path (limited by the tip diameter) along the material, enabling to draw electrically insulated tracks and pads.

{"title": "An ultra-low noise optical head for liquid environment atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "The design considerations and eventual performance of a new, ultra-low noise optical head for dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) are presented. The head, designed specifically for the study of hydration layers and ion organization next to solid surfaces and biomolecules, displays an integrated tip-sample distance noise below 3 pm. The sensitivity of the optical beam deflection sensor, operating at frequencies up to 8.6\u2009MHz (3 dB roll-off), is typically below 10\u2009fm/\u221aHz, enabling utilization of high frequency cantilevers of low thermal noise for fundamental and higher mode imaging. Exceptional signal stability and low optical noise are achieved by replacing the commonly used laser diode with a helium-neon laser. An integral photothermal excitation of the cantilever produces pure harmonic oscillations, minimizing the generation of higher cantilever modes and deleterious sound waves characterizing the commonly used excitation by a piezoelectric crystal. The optical head is designed to fit on top of the widespread Multimode(\u00ae) (Bruker) piezo-tube and accommodate its commercial liquid cell. The performance of the new AFM head is demonstrated by atomic resolution imaging of a muscovite mica surface in aqueous solution.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["ISchlesinger", "KKuchuk", "USivan"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4928497"}
{"title": "Whole-body vibration exercise in postmenopausal osteoporosis.", "abstract": "The report of the World Health Organization (WHO) of 2008 defines osteoporosis as a disease characterized by low bone mass and an increased risk of fracture. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is connected to the decrease in estrogens concentration as a result of malfunction of endocrine ovarian function. Low estrogens concentration causes increase in bone demineralization and results in osteoporosis. Physical activity, as a component of therapy of patients with osteoporosis, has been used for a long time now. One of the forms of safe physical activity is the vibration training. Training is to maintain a static position or execution of specific exercises involving the appropriate muscles on a vibrating platform, the mechanical vibrations are transmitted to the body of the patient. According to the piezoelectric theory, pressure induces bone formation in the electrical potential difference, which acts as a stimulant of the process of bone formation. Whole body vibration increases the level of growth hormone and testosterone in serum, preventing sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to review the literature on vibration exercise in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis based on the PubMed and Medline database.

{"title": "Engineered Iron/Iron Oxide Functionalized Membranes for Selenium and Other Toxic Metal Removal from Power Plant Scrubber Water.", "abstract": "The remediation of toxic metals from water with high concentrations of salt has been an emerging area for membrane separation. Cost-effective nanomaterials such as iron and iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely used in reductive and oxidative degradation of toxic organics. Similar procedures can be used for redox transformations of metal species (e.g. metal oxyanions to elemental metal), and/or adsorption of species on iron oxide surface. In this study, iron-functionalized membranes were developed for reduction and adsorption of selenium from coal-fired power plant scrubber water. Iron-functionalized membranes have advantages over iron suspension as the membrane prevents particle aggregation and dissolution. Both lab-scale and full-scale membranes were prepared first by coating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with polyacrylic acid (PAA), followed by ion exchange of ferrous ions and subsequent reduction to zero-valent iron nanoparticles. Water permeability of membrane decreased as the percent PAA functionalization increased, and the highest ion exchange capacity (IEC) was obtained at 20% PAA with highly pH responsive pores. Although high concentrations of sulfate and chloride in scrubber water decreased the reaction rate of selenium reduction, this was shown to be overcome by integration of nanofiltration (NF) and iron-functionalized membranes, and selenium concentration below 10 \u03bcg/L was achieved.", "journal": "Journal of membrane science", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["MinghuiGui", "Joseph KPapp", "Andrew SColburn", "Noah DMeeks", "BenjaminWeaver", "IlanWilf", "DibakarBhattacharyya"], "doi": "10.1016/j.memsci.2015.03.089"}

In this study, the interaction between parotid gland acinar cells (PGACs), fibroblasts, and biomaterials was investigated. We prepared different biomaterials, including chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVAL), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) to culture fibroblasts and then collect their conditioned media to culture PGACs. We observed no difference in AQP3, AQP5, and E-cadherin expression among different fibroblast conditioned medium treatments. Interestingly, \u03b1-amylase expression was obviously enhanced in PGACs cultured in the presence of conditioned medium from fibroblasts cultured on PVDF. Higher neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) expression was observed in PVDF-derived fibroblast conditioned medium using a growth factor protein array assay. In addition, directly adding NT-4 into the culture medium significantly promoted \u03b1-amylase expression by PGACs. Finally, nestin and \u03b2III-tubulin expression by fibroblasts cultured on PVDF was also enhanced. Together, these results suggest that PVDF could promote \u03b1-amylase expression by PGACs via the NT-4 produced by fibroblasts.\nTo date, there is no effective therapy for patients with dry mouth with persistent salivary hypofunction. The study made use of different biomaterials to culture fibroblasts and then collect their conditioned media to culture PGACs.

These forces vary according to the separation distance between the probe tip and the surface of the sample being examined. Hence, at a distance away from the surface (farther than d(on)), these forces have an attractive nature and are of Van der Waals type, and when the probe tip is situated in the range of a\u2080\u2264 d(ts) \u2264 d(on), the capillary force is added to the Van der Waals force. At a distance of d(ts) \u2264 a\u2080, the Van der Waals and capillary forces remain constant at intermolecular distances, and the contact repulsive force repels the probe tip from the surface of sample. The capillary force emerges due to the contact of thin water films with a thickness of h(c) which have accumulated on the sample and probe. Under environmental conditions a layer of water or hydrocarbon often forms between the probe tip and sample. The capillary meniscus can grow until the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation. For each of the above forces, different models are presented. The smoothness or roughness of the surfaces and the geometry of the cantilever tip have a significant effect on the modeling of forces applied on the probe tip. Van der Waals and the repulsive forces are considered to be the same in all the simulations, and only the capillary force is altered in order to evaluate the role of this force in the AFM-based modeling. Therefore, in view of the remarkable advantages of the piezoelectric microcantilever and also the extensive applications of the tapping mode, we investigate vibrational motion of the piezoelectric microcantilever in the tapping mode.

We use laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate ferroelectric bicolor PbTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 and tricolor PbTiO3/SrTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 superlattices and to study the role of the SrTiO3 layers on the domain structure. In the tricolor superlattices, we demonstrate the existence of 180\u00b0 ferroelectric stripe nanodomains, induced by the depolarization field produced by the SrTiO3 layers. Each ultrathin SrTiO3 layer modifies the electrostatic boundary conditions between the ferroelectric layers compared to the corresponding bicolor structures, leading to the suppression of the a/c polydomain states. Combined with the electrostatic effect, the tensile strain induced by PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 in the PbTiO3 layers leads to polarization rotation in the system as evidenced by grazing incidence X-ray measurements. This polarization rotation is associated with the monoclinic Mc phase as revealed by the splitting of the (HHL) and (H0L) reciprocal lattice points.

One of these properties, piezoelectricity, is important for micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems applications. Using symmetry analysis, we determine the independent piezoelectric coefficients for four groups of predicted and synthesized 2D materials. We calculate with density-functional perturbation theory the stiffness and piezoelectric tensors of these materials. We determine the in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d11 for 37 materials within the families of 2D metal dichalcogenides, metal oxides, and III-V semiconductor materials. A majority of the structures, including CrSe2, CrTe2, CaO, CdO, ZnO, and InN, have d11 coefficients greater than 5 pm/V, a typical value for bulk piezoelectric materials. Our symmetry analysis shows that buckled 2D materials exhibit an out-of-plane coefficient d31. We find that d31 for 8 III-V semiconductors ranges from 0.02 to 0.6 pm/V. From statistical analysis, we identify correlations between the piezoelectric coefficients and the electronic and structural properties of the 2D materials that elucidate the origin of the piezoelectricity.

It is revealed that depositing the strong electron-withdrawing PVDF polymer with a permanent dipole moment can induce the evident change of the electrostatic potential in the substrate zSiCNRs, like applying an electric field. As a result, this kind of noncovalent surface-modification by a polymer can break the magnetic degeneracy of zSiCNRs independent of the adsorption type and position, and sole ferromagnetic metallicity and even antiferromagnetic half-metallicity can be achieved. Moreover, all PVDF-modified zSiCNR systems can exhibit considerable adsorption energies in the range of -0.436 to -1.315 eV, indicating that these joint systems possess high structural stabilities.

Subsequently MFCs were operated in a cost efficient reactor design using Nafion, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, a nonspecific separator (Rhinohide), and a no-membrane design with a carbon-paper internal gas diffusion cathode.

The purpose of this study was to assess the role of this surgical instrument in paediatric craniofacial surgery in terms of safety and surgical outcomes.\nThirteen consecutive paediatric patients underwent craniofacial Le Fort osteotomies type III and IV. The saw was used on the right side in seven patients and on the left side in six patients; the piezoelectric instrument was used on the right side in six patients and on the left side in seven patients. Intraoperative blood loss, surgical procedure length, incision precision, postoperative haematoma and swelling, and nerve impairment were evaluated to compare the outcomes of both procedures.\nA longer surgical procedure was observed in 28% of the patients when using the piezoelectric device (p = 0.032), with an intraoperative blood loss reduction of 18% (p = 0.156). Greater precision in bone cutting was reported, together with a reduction in the requirement to protect and incise adjacent soft tissues during piezoelectric osteotomies. There was a lower incidence of postoperative haematoma and swelling following piezo-osteotomy, and a significant reduction in postoperative nerve impairment (p = 0.002).\nThe ultrasonic surgical device guaranteed a clean bone cut, preserving the integrity of the adjacent soft tissues beneath the bone. Although the time required for a piezoelectric osteotomy was longer, the total operation time remained approximately the same. In conclusion, the device's lack of power appears to be a minor problem compared with the advantages, and an ultrasonic device could be considered a valuable instrument for paediatric craniofacial advancement.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2015-08-26", "authors": ["GiuseppeSpinelli", "GiudittaMannelli", "Yi XinZhang", "DavideLazzeri", "BarbaraSpacca", "LorenzoGenitori", "MircoRaffaini", "TommasoAgostini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2015.07.012"}

In PET operation, an input gate voltage expands a piezoelectric element (PE), transducing the input into a pressure pulse which compresses a piezoresistive element (PR). The PR resistance goes down, transducing the signal back to voltage and turning the switch 'on'. This transduction physics, in principle, allows fast, low-voltage operation.

Our previous research demonstrated that the piezoelectric membrane generated electrical outputs in response to the sound stimulation after implantation into the guinea pig cochlea, whereas electrodes for the stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons have not been fabricated, and a method to fix the device in the cochlea is also required to show proof-of-concept. In the present study, to achieve proof-of-concept of hearing recovery by implantation of the artificial cochlear sensory epithelium, we fabricated new electrodes that stick into the cochlear modiolus, which also play a role in the fixation of the device in the cochlea. The efficacy of new electrodes for fixation of the device in the cochlea and for the stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons was estimated in guinea pigs. Four weeks after implantation, we confirmed that the devices were in place. Histological analysis of the implanted cochleae revealed inconspicuous fibrosis and scar formation compared with the sham-operated specimens (n = 5 for each). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method was used to assess cell death due to surgical procedures in the cochleae that were harvested after 1 day (n = 6) and 7 days (n = 6) of implantation; there was no significant increase in apoptotic cell death in the implanted cochleae compared with sham-operated cochleae. In seven animals, serial measurements of electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses were obtained, with the electrode positioned in the scala tympani and with the electrode inserted into the cochlear modiolus. With the insertion of electrodes into the cochlear modiolus, significant reduction was achieved in the thresholds of electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses compared with those placed in the scala tympani (p = 0.028).

The short life cycle usually results from the delamination of the components due to stresses at the interface during the actuation. In this work, to achieve strong adhesion to poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (\nPSS) electrodes, the wetting properties of the surface of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane are improved using argon-plasma-induced surface polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). Hybrid membranes are created with hydrophilic PVDF-graft-PEGMA outer surfaces and hydrophobic bulk. The width of each layer is controlled by spray coating, as it allows for the deposition of the reaction precursor to a certain depth. Subsequently, a\nPSS water solution fills the pores of the functionalized part of the membrane and a mixing layer between\nPSS and PVDF is created. We also show that PVDF-graft-PEGMA copolymers play an important role in binding the membrane to the electrodes and that direct mechanical interlocking in the pores can further improve the adhesion. Finally,\nPSS/PVDF-graft-PEGMA/PEDOT:PSS actuators are made by simple solution casting. They are capable of producing high strains of 0.6% and show no signs of delamination after more than 150 h or 10(4) actuation cycles. Furthermore, the preservation of the hydrophobic membrane in between two\nPSS layers increases the resistance between them from 0.36 \u03a9 to 0.16 M\u03a9, thus drastically modifying the power dissipation of the actuators.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-08-21", "authors": ["AivaSimaite", "BertrandTondu", "PhilippeSou\u00e8res", "ChristianBergaud"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b04578"}

Here, a 3D network of graphene oxide is deposited from solution on the template and then is chemically reduced. Following steps of ZnO nanowire growth, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) backfilling and electrode lamination completes the fabrication processes. When compared to conventional generators with 2D planar geometry, the sponge template provides a 3D structure that has a potential to increase power density per unit area.

The nanogenerator yields an open circuit voltage of \u223c0.5 V and short circuit current density of \u223c2 \u03bcA/cm(2), while the output was found to be consistent after \u223c3000 cycles.

A large electrical throughput (open circuit voltage \u223c35 V with power density \u223c2.43 \u03bcW/cm(3)) from PANI supplement added nanogenerator (PZP-FPNG) indicates that it is an effective means to replace the MWCNTs filler.

Surrounding gliotic tissue was preserved. As a consequence, the cavernous malformations were successfully removed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed total removal of lesions in all cases. Preoperative neurological symptoms completely resolved in 2 patients.

{"title": "Ultrasonic Technique for Density Measurement of Liquids in Extreme Conditions.", "abstract": "An ultrasonic technique, invariant to temperature changes, for a density measurement of different liquids under in situ extreme conditions is presented. The influence of geometry and material parameters of the measurement system (transducer, waveguide, matching layer) on measurement accuracy and reliability is analyzed theoretically along with experimental results. The proposed method is based on measurement of the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave, reflected from the interface of the solid/liquid medium under investigation. In order to enhance sensitivity, the use of a quarter wavelength acoustic matching layer is proposed. Therefore, the sensitivity of the measurement system increases significantly. Density measurements quite often must be performed in extreme conditions at high temperature (up to 220 \u00b0C) and high pressure. In this case, metal waveguides between piezoelectric transducer and the measured liquid are used in order to protect the conventional transducer from the influence of high temperature and to avoid depolarization.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gentamicin-coated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) suture material has beneficial effect on anastomotic healing.\nNinety Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: a PVDF-suture group, a gentamicin-coated PVDF (GPVDF)-suture group and a control group using Maxon\u00ae (polyglycolid-co-trimethylene carbonate). For each animal, a colonic anastomosis was performed. Ten animals from each group were sacrificed on postoperative days 3, 5, and 14. Measurements of anastomotic bursting pressure were performed on days 3 and 5. At each time, collagen type I/III ratio, MMP 2 and MMP-9 expression and the proliferation index (Ki67) were analyzed.\nIn total, 90 animals underwent surgery without postoperative complications. Bursting strength in the GPVDF group was significantly elevated on day 5. Immunohistochemistry showed significant increase of the collagen type I/III ratio for PVDF and GPVDF on days 3 and 5. MMP2 was significantly increased for PVDF on days 3 and 5 and for GPVDF on day 5. The analysis of MMP9 revealed significant increase compared to control on day 3 and 5 (GPVDF) as well as on day 5 (PVDF). Staining for Ki67 revealed a significant elevation on postoperative day 3 for the PVDF and the GPVDF group.\nThe present data shows the feasibility of PVDF as suture material for colonic anastomosis and confirms the ability of gentamicin to increase the stability of colonic anastomosis when used as coating material.", "journal": "International journal of colorectal disease", "date": "2015-08-12", "authors": ["Dominik SSchoeb", "Christian DKlink", "AndreasLambertz", "RomanEickhoff", "DanielBusch", "Tom FUlmer", "Ulf PNeumann", "MarcelBinneb\u00f6sel"], "doi": "10.1007/s00384-015-2345-0"}

The studies reveal that the incorporation of GeO2 or SiO2 nanoparticles leads to an enhancement in the electroactive \u03b2 phase fraction of PVDF due to the strong interactions between the negatively charged nanoparticle surface and polymer. Analysis of the thermal properties of the as-prepared samples also supports the increment of the \u03b2 phase fraction in PVDF. Variation of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and ac conductivity with frequency and loading fraction of the nanoparticles were also studied for all the as-prepared films. Dielectric constant of the nanocomposite films increases with increasing nanofiller concentration in PVDF. 15 mass% SiO2-loaded PVDF film shows the highest dielectric constant, which can be attributed to the smaller size of SiO2 nanoparticles and the homogeneous and discrete dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles in PVDF matrix.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-08-12", "authors": ["EpsitaKar", "NavonilBose", "SukhenDas", "NillohitMukherjee", "SampadMukherjee"], "doi": "10.1039/c5cp03975d"}

{"title": "Impact imaging of aircraft composite structure based on a model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter.", "abstract": "The spatial-wavenumber filtering technique is an effective approach to distinguish the propagating direction and wave mode of Lamb wave in spatial-wavenumber domain. Therefore, it has been gradually studied for damage evaluation in recent years. But for on-line impact monitoring in practical application, the main problem is how to realize the spatial-wavenumber filtering of impact signal when the wavenumber of high spatial resolution cannot be measured or the accurate wavenumber curve cannot be modeled. In this paper, a new model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter based impact imaging method is proposed. In this method, a 2D cross-shaped array constructed by two linear piezoelectric (PZT) sensor arrays is used to acquire impact signal on-line. The continuous complex Shannon wavelet transform is adopted to extract the frequency narrowband signals from the frequency wideband impact response signals of the PZT sensors. A model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter is designed based on the spatial-wavenumber filtering technique. Based on the designed filter, a wavenumber searching and best match mechanism is proposed to implement the spatial-wavenumber filtering of the frequency narrowband signals without modeling, which can be used to obtain a wavenumber-time image of the impact relative to a linear PZT sensor array. By using the two wavenumber-time images of the 2D cross-shaped array, the impact direction can be estimated without blind angle. The impact distance relative to the 2D cross-shaped array can be calculated by using the difference of time-of-flight between the frequency narrowband signals of two different central frequencies and the corresponding group velocities. The validations performed on a carbon fiber composite laminate plate and an aircraft composite oil tank show a good impact localization accuracy of the model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter based impact imaging method.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-08-09", "authors": ["LeiQiu", "BinLiu", "ShenfangYuan", "ZhongqingSu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.07.006"}

The study was performed on 38 eyeballs of 19 New Zealand white rabbits (19 implanted, 19 control). Histological assessment was carried out between 2 and 52 weeks after surgery.

No features of acute inflammatory response to the implant were observed, and there was an absence of histological features of acute inflammatory infiltrates and subsidence of chronic inflammatory infiltrates and resorptive granulation over time.\nSlight fibrotic response and insignificant changes in neighboring eye tissues all indicate good tolerance to bioimplant materials.

As information on the internal ballistics of homemade gas combustion-powered guns is scarce, it is the aim of this work to provide an experimental model of the internal ballistics of these devices and to investigate their basic physical parameters. A gas combustion gun was constructed with a steel tube as the main component. Gas/air mixtures of acetylene, hydrogen, and ethylene were used as propellants for discharging a 46-mm caliber test projectile. Gas pressure in the combustion chamber was captured with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. Projectile velocity was measured with a ballistic speed measurement system. The maximum gas pressure, the maximum rate of pressure rise, the time parameters of the pressure curve, and the velocity and path of the projectile through the barrel as a function of time were determined according to the pressure-time curve. The maximum gas pressure was measured to be between 1.4 bar (ethylene) and 4.5 bar (acetylene). The highest maximum rate of pressure rise was determined for hydrogen at (dp/dt)max = 607 bar/s. The muzzle energy was calculated to be between 67 J (ethylene) and 204 J (acetylene). To conclude, this work provides basic information on the internal ballistics of homemade gas combustion guns.

{"title": "Energy harvesting performance of piezoelectric ceramic and polymer nanowires.", "abstract": "Energy harvesting from ubiquitous ambient vibrations is attractive for autonomous small-power applications and thus considerable research is focused on piezoelectric materials as they permit direct inter-conversion of mechanical and electrical energy. Nanogenerators (NGs) based on piezoelectric nanowires are particularly attractive due to their sensitivity to small-scale vibrations and may possess superior mechanical-to-electrical conversion efficiency when compared to bulk or thin-film devices of the same material. However, candidate piezoelectric nanowires have hitherto been predominantly analyzed in terms of NG output (i.e. output voltage, output current and output power density). Surprisingly, the corresponding dynamical properties of the NG, including details of how the nanowires are mechanically driven and its impact on performance, have been largely neglected. Here we investigate all realizable NG driving contexts separately involving inertial displacement, applied stress T and applied strain S, highlighting the effect of driving mechanism and frequency on NG performance in each case. We argue that, in the majority of cases, the intrinsic high resonance frequencies of piezoelectric nanowires (\u223ctens of MHz) present no barrier to high levels of NG performance even at frequencies far below resonance (<1 kHz) typically characteristic of ambient vibrations. In this context, we introduce vibrational energy harvesting (VEH) coefficients \u03b7S and \u03b7T, based on intrinsic materials properties, for comparing piezoelectric NG performance under strain-driven and stress-driven conditions respectively. These figures of merit permit, for the first time, a general comparison of piezoelectric nanowires for NG applications that takes into account the nature of the mechanical excitation. We thus investigate the energy harvesting performance of prototypical piezoelectric ceramic and polymer nanowires. We find that even though ceramic and polymer nanowires have been found, in certain cases, to have similar energy conversion efficiencies, ceramics are more promising in strain-driven NGs while polymers are more promising for stress-driven NGs.

The experimental results show that the energy harvester with two ZnO piezoelectric elements in parallel connection in Design II has higher load voltage and higher load power than the fabricated energy harvesters with other designs. Its load voltage is 2.06 V under load resistance of 1 M\u03a9 and its maximal load power is 1.25 \u03bcW under load resistance of 0.6 M\u03a9, when it is excited by an external vibration with frequency of 1300.1 Hz and acceleration of 10 m/s(2).

{"title": "Modular apparatus for electrostatic actuation of common atomic force microscope cantilevers.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuation of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers often suffers from spurious mechanical resonances in the loop between the signal driving the cantilever and the actual tip motion. These spurious resonances can reduce the accuracy of AFM measurements and in some cases completely obscure the cantilever response. To address these limitations, we developed a specialized AFM cantilever holder for electrostatic actuation of AFM cantilevers. The holder contains electrical contacts for the AFM cantilever chip, as well as an electrode (or electrodes) that may be precisely positioned with respect to the back of the cantilever. By controlling the voltages on the AFM cantilever and the actuation electrode(s), an electrostatic force is applied directly to the cantilever, providing a near-ideal transfer function from drive signal to tip motion. We demonstrate both static and dynamic actuations, achieved through the application of direct current and alternating current voltage schemes, respectively. As an example application, we explore contact resonance atomic force microscopy, which is a technique for measuring the mechanical properties of surfaces on the sub-micron length scale. Using multiple electrodes, we also show that the torsional resonances of the AFM cantilever may be excited electrostatically, opening the door for advanced dynamic lateral force measurements with improved accuracy and precision.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["Christian JLong", "Rachel JCannara"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4926431"}

We have designed and implemented an array of modular pneumatic (double-diaphragm), mechanical (gearboxes), and piezoelectric devices and their combinations for controlling pressure and compression/decompression rate at various temperature conditions from 4 K in cryostats to several thousand Kelvin in laser-heated DACs. Because HPCAT is a user facility and diamond cells for user experiments are typically provided by users, our development effort has been focused on creating different loading mechanisms and frames for a variety of existing and commonly used diamond cells rather than designing specialized or dedicated diamond cells with various drives.

Knowing the dispersion and wave propagation properties in such a structure is of great importance for non-destructive material testing and structural health monitoring applications for accurate damage detection and localization. In the proposed study, the wavefield is generated by a circular piezoelectric wafer active sensor and measured by a scanning laser-Doppler-vibrometer. The measurements are compared with a theoretical group delay estimation and a signal prediction for the antisymmetric wave motion along the non-uniform propagation path. The required dispersion curves are derived from the well-known global matrix method for segments of constant thickness. A multidimensional frequency-wavenumber analysis of linescan data and the full wavefield provides further insight of the adiabatic wave motion because the wavenumber changes along the tapered geometry of the waveguide. In addition, it is demonstrated that a terahertz time-domain system can be used in glass-fiber reinforced plastic structures as a tool to estimate the thickness profile of thin structures by means of time-of-flight measurements.

The sensing strategy aims at global control and works with a fewer number of sensors. It is based on the established concept of radiation modes and hence does not add too many states to the order of the system. Acoustic potential energy is sensed using a combination of a Kalman filter and a frequency weighting filter with the structural response measurements as the inputs. The use of Kalman filter also makes the system robust against measurement noise. The formulation of the strategy is presented using finite element models of the system including that of sensors and actuators so that it can be easily applied to practical systems. The sensing strategy is numerically evaluated in the framework of Linear Quadratic Gaussian based feedback control of interior noise in a rectangular box cavity with a flexible plate with single and multiple pairs of piezoelectric sensor-actuator patches when broadband disturbances act on the plate. The performance is compared with an \"acoustic filter\" that models the complete transfer function from the structure to the acoustic domain.

Also, an animal model was used to verify the characteristics of the ABM as a front end for potential cochlear implant applications. For this, a signal processor was used to convert the piezoelectric output from the ABM to an electrical stimulus for auditory neurons. The electrical stimulus for auditory neurons was delivered through an implanted intra-cochlear electrode array. The amplitude of the electrical stimulus was modulated in the range of 0.15 to 3.5 V with incoming sound pressure levels (SPL) of 70.1 to 94.8 dB SPL. The electrical stimulus was used to elicit an electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) from deafened guinea pigs.

{"title": "Can piezoelectric ultrasound osteotomies result in serious noise trauma?", "abstract": "The use of ultrasound to cut bone in oral and craniofacial surgery has increased. There is concern that the application of ultrasound to the craniofacial skeleton might represent a potential hazard to the inner ear because of sound transmission by bone conduction resulting in hearing trauma. Conventional and ultrasound osteotomies were performed on human specimens of temporal bone containing an intact middle and inner ear. The equivalent sound pressure was measured with a microphone at the round window, which had been calibrated with a bone conduction audiometer. Conventional osteotomy with a rose burr resulted in maximum sound pressures of 125dB(A) consisting of major frequency components at 2100, 7600, and 9300Hz. Ultrasound osteotomy resulted in maximum sound pressures of 122dB(A) and exhibited major frequency components at around 10kHz, 20kHz, and 26.5kHz. Ultrasound osteotomies have no acoustic advantage over conventional osteotomies. Both osteotomy techniques can produce noise-induced hearing trauma, especially when applied over longer durations of time. This appears to be more relevant for ultrasound osteotomies, because the bone cutting efficiency is usually poorer than in conventional osteotomies.

Our results demonstrate a major impact of hydrostatic pressure on amino acid metabolism, with increases from 3 amino acids required at atmospheric pressure to 17 at 40 MPa. We observe in T. barophilus and other Thermococcales a similar discrepancy between the presence/absence of amino acid synthesis pathways and amino acid requirements, which supports the existence of alternate, but yet unknown, amino acid synthesis pathways, and may explain the low number of essential amino acids observed in T. barophilus and other Thermococcales. T. barophilus displays a strong metabolic preference for organic polymers such as polypeptides and chitin, which may constitute a more readily available resource of carbon and energy in situ in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We hypothesize that the low energy yields of fermentation of organic polymers, together with energetic constraints imposed by high hydrostatic pressure, may render de novo synthesis of amino acids ecologically unfavorable.

In particular, the influence of surface charges is well-known but still controversial, especially when new functional materials and methods are introduced. Here, the influence of the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LN) on the adhesion properties of fibroblast cells is investigated. The spontaneous polarization of LN has one of the largest known magnitudes at room temperature (\u223c78 \u03bcC/cm(2)), and its orientation can be patterned easily by an external voltage, this motivating highly the investigation of its interaction with cells. Immunofluorescence and migration assays show strong evidence that the surface polarity regulates the adhesion functions, with enhanced spreading of the cytoskeleton on the negative face. The results suggest the potential of LN as a platform for investigating the role of charges on cellular processes, thus favoring new strategies in fabricating those biocompatible constructs used for tissue engineering.

A Grand Challenge in metal recovery from industrial wastewater is to design and synthesize high capacity, recyclable and robust chelating ligands with tunable metal ion selectivity that can be efficiently processed into low-energy separation materials and modules. In our efforts to develop high capacity chelating membranes for metal recovery from impaired water, we report a one-pot method for the preparation of a new family of mixed matrix polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with in situ synthesized poly(amidoamine) [PAMAM] particles.

The isolation, detection and structural characterization of the carbohydrate (glycan) component of GSLs are particularly challenging given their structural heterogeneity and thus rely on the development of sensitive, analytical technologies.\nNeutral and acidic GSL standards were immobilized onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and glycans were enzymatically released using endoglycoceramidase II (EGCase II), separated by porous graphitized carbon (PGC) liquid chromatography and structurally characterized by negative ion mode electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (PGC-LC/ESI-MS/MS). This approach was then employed for GSLs isolated from 100 mg of serous and endometrioid cancer tissue and from cell line (10(7) cells) samples.\nGlycans were released from GSL standards comprising of ganglio-, asialo-ganglio- and the relatively resistant globo-series glycans, using as little as 1 mU of enzyme and 2 \u00b5g of GSL. The platform of analysis was then applied to GSLs isolated from tissue and cell line samples and the released isomeric and isobaric glycan structures were chromatographically resolved on PGC and characterized by comparison with the MS(2) fragment ion spectra of the glycan standards and by application of known structural MS(2) fragment ions. This approach identified several (neo-)lacto-, globo- and ganglio-series glycans and facilitated the discrimination of isomeric structures containing Lewis A, H type 1 and type 2 blood group antigens and sialyl-tetraosylceramides.\nWe describe a relatively simple, detergent-free, enzymatic release of glycans from PVDF-immobilized GSLs, followed by the detailed structural analysis afforded by PGC-LC-ESI-MS/MS, to offer a versatile method for the analysis of tumour and cell-derived GSL-glycans. The method uses the potential of MS(2) fragmentation in negative ion ESI mode to characterize, in detail, the biologically relevant glycan structures derived from GSLs.", "journal": "Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM", "date": "2015-07-28", "authors": ["MerrinaAnugraham", "Arun VijayEverest-Dass", "FrancisJacob", "Nicolle HPacker"], "doi": "10.1002/rcm.7130"}

The polymeric film was formed on the surface of gold electrode as well as on gold-coated electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) electrode by electropolymerization of 3-TAA in presence of mel template by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Various parameters were optimized for controlling the performance of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) modified sensor such as ratio of monomer and template ratio, number of electropolymerization cycles, mass deposited in each cycle, pH, etc. The prepared MIP sensor was highly specific towards mel and the recognition was analyzed by both differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to verify the changes in currents. In the optimal condition, response of MIP sensor to mel was linearly proportional to its concentration with limit of detection (LOD) as 5.40 ng mL(-1).

To mitigate some of the material redistribution effects associated with the drying of printed droplets containing finely divided materials, the metallic nanoparticles are formed after the printing and drying process is completed, by way of an in situ reduction of an appropriate metal salt by the poly(vinyl-alcohol)-host matrix itself, which takes place at modest temperatures compatible with most substrate materials.

{"title": "Michelson interferometer vibrometer using self-correcting synthetic-heterodyne demodulation.", "abstract": "Synthetic-heterodyne demodulation is a useful technique for dynamic displacement and velocity detection in interferometric sensors, as it can provide an output signal that is immune to interferometric drift. With the advent of cost-effective, high-speed real-time signal-processing systems and software, processing of the complex signals encountered in interferometry has become more feasible. In synthetic heterodyne, to obtain the actual dynamic displacement or vibration of the object under test requires knowledge of the interferometer visibility and also the argument of two Bessel functions. In this paper, a method is described for determining the former and setting the Bessel function argument to a set value, which ensures maximum sensitivity. Conventional synthetic-heterodyne demodulation requires the use of two in-phase local oscillators; however, the relative phase of these oscillators relative to the interferometric signal is unknown. It is shown that, by using two additional quadrature local oscillators, a demodulated signal can be obtained that is independent of this phase difference. The experimental interferometer is a Michelson configuration using a visible single-mode laser, whose current is sinusoidally modulated at a frequency of 20\u00a0kHz. The detected interferometer output is acquired using a 250\u00a0kHz analog-to-digital converter and processed in real time. The system is used to measure the displacement sensitivity frequency response and linearity of a piezoelectric mirror shifter over a range of 500\u00a0Hz to 10\u00a0kHz.

Therapeutic approaches exhibit an improved healing rate under electric fields. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood so far. In this context one possible effect which could be responsible is the inverse piezo electric effect at bone structures. Therefore, we have carried out scanning X-ray microdiffraction experiments, i.e. we recorded X-ray diffraction data with micrometer resolution using synchrotron radiation from trabecular bone samples in order to investigate how the bone matrix reacts to an applied electric field. Different samples were investigated, where the orientation of the collagen matrix differed with respect to the applied electric field. Our experiments aimed to determine whether the inverse piezo electric effect could have a significant impact on the improved bone regeneration owing to electrostimulative therapy. Our data suggest that strain is in fact induced in bone by the collagen matrix via the inverse piezo electric effect which occurs in the presence of an adequately oriented electric field. The magnitude of the underlying strain is in a range where bone cells are able to detect it.\nIn our study we report on the piezoelectric effect in bone which was already discovered and explored on a macro scale in the 1950. Clinical approaches utilize successfully electro stimulation to enhance bone healing but the exact mechanisms taking place are still a matter of debate. We have measured the stress distribution with micron resolution in trabecular bone to determine the piezo electric induced stress. Our results show that the magnitude of the induced stress is big enough to be sensed by cells and therefore, could be a trigger for bone remodeling and growth.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-07-21", "authors": ["D C FWieland", "CKrywka", "EMick", "RWillumeit-R\u00f6mer", "RBader", "DKluess"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.021"}

So the determination and control of ferroelectric domain switching angles is crucial for nonvolatile information storage and exchange-coupled magnetoelectric devices. We try to study the intrinsic characters of polarization switching in BiFeO3 by introducing a special data processing method to determine the switching angle from 2D PFM (Piezoresponse Force Microscopy) images of randomly oriented samples. The response surface of BiFeO3 is first plotted using the piezoelectric tensor got from first principles calculations. Then from the normalized 2D PFM signals before and after switching, the switching angles of randomly oriented BiFeO3 grains can be determined through numerical calculations. In the polycrystalline BiFeO3 films, up to 34% of all switched area is that with original out-of-plane (OP) polarization parallel to the poling field. 71\u00b0 polarization switching is more favorable, with the area percentages of 71\u00b0, 109\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 domain switching being about 42%, 29% and 29%, respectively. Our analysis further reveals that IP stress and charge migration have comparable effect on switching, and they are sensitive to the geometric arrangements.

The actuation system consists of electrodes printed on a continuous layer of piezoelectric material bonded to an optical-quality substrate. The electrodes provide almost full coverage of the piezoelectric layer, in order to maximize the amount of active material that is available for actuation, and their shape is optimized to maximize the correctability and stroke of the mirror for a chosen number of independent actuators and for a dominant imperfection mode. The starting point for the design of the electrodes is the observation that the correction of a figure error that has at least two planes of mirror symmetry is optimally done with twin actuators that have the same optimized shape but are rotated through a suitable angle. Additional sets of optimized twin actuators are defined by considering the intersection between the twin actuators, and hence an arbitrarily fine actuation pattern can be generated. It is shown that this approach leads to actuator systems with better performance than simple, geometrically based actuators. Several actuator patterns to correct third-order astigmatism aberrations are presented, and an experimental demonstration of a 41-actuator mirror is also presented.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2015-07-21", "authors": ["MarieLaslandes", "KeithPatterson", "SergioPellegrino"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.54.004937"}
{"title": "Piezoresistivity and Strain-induced Band Gap Tuning in Atomically Thin MoS2.", "abstract": "Continuous tuning of material properties is highly desirable for a wide range of applications, with strain engineering being an interesting way of achieving it. The tuning range, however, is limited in conventional bulk materials that can suffer from plasticity and low fracture limit due to the presence of defects and dislocations. Atomically thin membranes such as MoS2 on the other hand exhibit high Young's modulus and fracture strength, which makes them viable candidates for modifying their properties via strain. The bandgap of MoS2 is highly strain-tunable, which results in the modulation of its electrical conductivity and manifests itself as the piezoresistive effect, whereas a piezoelectric effect was also observed in odd-layered MoS2 with broken inversion symmetry. This coupling between electrical and mechanical properties makes MoS2 a very promising material for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Here, we incorporate monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer MoS2 in a nanoelectromechanical membrane configuration. We detect strain-induced band gap tuning via electrical conductivity measurements and demonstrate the emergence of the piezoresistive effect in MoS2. Finite element method (FEM) simulations are used to quantify the band gap change and to obtain a comprehensive picture of the spatially varying bandgap profile on the membrane. The piezoresistive gauge factor is calculated to be -148 \u00b1 19, -224 \u00b1 19, and -43.5 \u00b1 11 for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer MoS2, respectively, which is comparable to state-of-the-art silicon strain sensors and 2 orders of magnitude higher than in strain sensors based on suspended graphene.

The dorsal bipolar dendritic (dbd) sensory neurons are putative stretch receptors in the Drosophila larval body wall. We have developed an in vivo protocol to obtain receptor potential recordings from intact dbd neurons in response to stretch. Receptor potential changes in dbd neurons in response to stretch showed a complex, dynamic profile with similar characteristics to those previously observed for mammalian muscle spindles. These profiles were reproduced by a general in silico model of stretch-activated neurons. This in silico model predicts an essential role for a mechanosensory cation channel (MSC) in all aspects of receptor potential generation. Using pharmacological and genetic techniques, we identified the mechanosensory channel, DmPiezo, in this functional role in dbd neurons, with TRPA1 playing a subsidiary role. We also show that rat muscle spindles exhibit a ruthenium red-sensitive current, but found no expression evidence to suggest that this corresponds to Piezo activity. In summary, we show that the dbd neuron is a stretch receptor and demonstrate that this neuron is a tractable model for investigating mechanisms of mechanotransduction.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-07-18", "authors": ["Thomas JSuslak", "SoniaWatson", "Karen JThompson", "Fiona CShenton", "Guy SBewick", "J DouglasArmstrong", "Andrew PJarman"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0130969\n10.1152/physrev.00048.2011\n10.1242/jeb.023507\n10.3109/0954898X.2011.638967\n10.1126/science.1198904\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1186/1756-0500-3-154\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.182683\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.021\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1073/pnas.1001425107\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0522-13.2013\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.12.024\n10.1038/embor.2013.170\n10.1074/jbc.M110.106153"}
{"title": "Bulk longitudinal wave reflection/transmission in periodic piezoelectric structures with metallized interfaces.", "abstract": "A theoretical study is performed of the bulk acoustic wave propagation in periodic piezoelectric structures with metallized interperiod boundaries. A crucial specific feature of such structures is that the bounded acoustic beam incident perpendicular to an interface can generate scattered (i.e. reflected and transmitted) waves over the whole area of the interface rather than only within the spot where this acoustic beam crosses the interface as it occurs in the absence of metallization. This extra generation is due to the electric potential which is induced by the incident wave on the whole metallized boundary rather than only on its part. The expressions are obtained for the reflection and transmission coefficients in the case where a longitudinal wave propagates along the 6-fold symmetry axis of a hexagonal piezoelectric. The periodicity is realized by inserting thin metallic layers (electrodes) into otherwise homogeneous material perpendicular to its 6-fold axis. The derived expressions allow the determination of the amplitude of waves arising both inside and outside the incident acoustic beam. The analysis of these expressions shows that the extra generation in question is able to significantly alter the distribution of the wave amplitudes as compared with the pattern which is obtained without taking into account the wave fields appearing outside the domain occupied by the incident acoustic beam.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-07-18", "authors": ["A NDarinskii", "A LShuvalov", "OPoncelet", "A AKutsenko"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.06.014"}

{"title": "Orientational Coherent Effects of High-Energy Particles in a LiNbO3 Crystal.", "abstract": "A bent lithium niobate strip was exposed to a 400-GeV/c proton beam at the external lines of CERN Super Proton Synchrotron to probe its capabilities versus coherent interactions of the particles with the crystal such as channeling and volume reflection. Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) exhibits an interplanar electric field comparable to that of Silicon (Si) and remarkable piezoelectric properties, which could be exploited for the realization of piezo-actuated devices for the control of high-energy particle beams. In contrast to Si and germanium (Ge), LiNbO3 shows an intriguing effect; in spite of a low channeling efficiency (3%), the volume reflection maintains a high deflection efficiency (83%). Such discrepancy was ascribed to the high concentration (10(4)\u2009per\u2009cm2) of dislocations in our sample, which was obtained from a commercial wafer. Indeed, it has been theoretically shown that a channeling efficiency comparable with that of Si or Ge would be attained with a crystal at low defect concentration (less than ten per cm2). To better understand the role of dislocations on volume reflection, we have worked out computer simulation via dynecharm++ Monte Carlo code to study the effect of dislocations on volume reflection.

In this article, we report on a battery-operated e-spinning apparatus (BOEA) based on miniaturization and integration. The new device gets liberated from the conventional heavy power supply, achieves the tight integration of functional parts and can be operated by a single hand due to its small volume (10.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm(3)) and light weight (about 120 g). Different polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polycaprolactone (PCL), polystyrene (PS), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) were electrospun into fibers successfully, which confirms the stable performance and good real-time control capability of the apparatus.

{"title": "Silicon micromachined ultrasonic scalpel for the dissection and coagulation of tissue.", "abstract": "This work presents a planar, longitudinal mode ultrasonic scalpel microfabricated from monocrystalline silicon wafers. Silicon was selected as the material for the ultrasonic horn due to its high speed of sound and thermal conductivity as well as its low density compared to commonly used titanium based alloys. Combined with a relatively high Young's modulus, a lighter, more efficient design for the ultrasonic scalpel can be implemented which, due to silicon batch manufacturing, can be fabricated at a lower cost. Transverse displacement of the piezoelectric actuators is coupled into the planar silicon structure and amplified by its horn-like geometry. Using finite element modeling and experimental displacement and velocity data as well as cutting tests, key design parameters have been identified that directly influence the power efficiency and robustness of the device as well as its ease of controllability when driven in resonance. Designs in which the full- and half-wave transverse modes of the transducer are matched or not matched to the natural frequencies of the piezoelectric actuators have been evaluated. The performance of the Si micromachined scalpels has been found to be comparable to existing commercial titanium based ultrasonic scalpels used in surgical operations for efficient dissection of tissue as well as coaptation and coagulation of tissue for hemostasis. Tip displacements (peak-to-peak) of the scalpels in the range of 10-50 \u03bcm with velocities ranging from 4 to 11 m/s have been achieved. The frequency of operation is in the range of 50-100 kHz depending on the transverse operating mode and the length of the scalpel.

{"title": "Fast filtration sampling protocol for mammalian suspension cells tailored for phosphometabolome profiling by capillary ion chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Capillary ion chromatography (capIC) is the premium separation technology for low molecular phosphometabolites and nucleotides in biological extracts. Removal of excessive amounts of salt during sample preparation stages is a prerequisite to enable high quality capIC separation in combination with reproducible and sensitive MS detection. Existing sampling protocols for mammalian cells used for GC-MS and LC-MS metabolic profiling can therefore not be directly applied to capIC separations. Here, the development of a fast filtration sampling protocol for mammalian suspension cells tailored for quantitative profiling of the phosphometabolome on capIC-MS/MS is presented. The whole procedure from sampling the culture to transfer of filter to quenching and extraction solution takes less than 10s. To prevent leakage it is critical that a low vacuum pressure is applied, and satisfactorily reproducibility was only obtained by usage of a vacuum pressure controlling device. A vacuum of 60mbar was optimal for filtration of multiple myeloma Jjn-3 cell cultures through 5\u03bcm polyvinylidene (PVDF) filters. A quick deionized water (DI-water) rinse step prior to extraction was tested, and significantly higher metabolite yields were obtained during capIC-MS/MS analyses in this extract compared to extracts prepared by saline and reduced saline (25%) washing steps only. In addition, chromatographic performance was dramatically improved. Thus, it was verified that a quick DI-water rinse is tolerated by the cells and can be included as the final stage during filtration. Over 30 metabolites were quantitated in JJN-3 cell extracts by using the optimized sampling protocol with subsequent capIC-MS/MS analysis, and up to 2 million cells can be used in a single filtration step for the chosen filter and vacuum pressure. The technical set-up is also highly advantageous for microbial metabolome filtration protocols after optimization of vacuum pressure and washing solutions, and the reduced salt content of the extract will also improve the quality of LC-MS analysis due to lower salt adduct ion formation.", "journal": "Journal of chromatography.

{"title": "Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations on the Disintegration of PVDF, FP-POSS, and Their Composite during Atomic Oxygen Impact.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a kind of important piezoelectric polymer used in spacecraft industry. But the atomic oxygen (AO) is the most abundant element in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment. AO collision degradation is an important issue in the application of PVDF on spacecrafts. To investigate the erosion behaviors of PVDF during AO impacts and how to improve the stability of PVDF against AO impacts, the temperature evolution, mass loss, and erosion yields of neat PVDF, neat polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes compound (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)8Si8O12 (FP-POSS) and the PVDF/FP-POSS composite under AO impacts, as well as some key disintegrated structures and separated chemical compositions, were researched using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the reactive ReaxFF force field. The simulation erosion yield result of PVDF is very close to the experiment results, which shows our simulations are reliable. The results of the temperature evolution, mass loss, and erosion yield of three materials show that the antierosion performance of PVDF is not outstanding. However, incorporating FP-POSS into PVDF matrix enhances the stability of PVDF against AO impact greatly and reduces the temperature rise, mass loss, and the erosion yield of PVDF rapidly. A detailed analysis on the flight chemical compositions and key snapshots of the structures reveals that the erosion process on PVDF and PVDF/FP-POSS is continuous and should be derived from the same PVDF matrix in two materials. In contrast, the erosion process on FP-POSS is stepped. The erosion will not take place until the number of AO reaches a specific value. There is a barrier for the erosion of high-energy AO because of the stable cagelike Si-O frame in FP-POSS molecules. This should be chiefly responsible for the high stability of FP-POSS and the reinforcement mechanism of FP-POSS on PVDF against AO impacts. This work is helpful for people to understand the erosion details of PVDF and POSS and provides valuable information to design effective protective structure for PVDF against AO impacts in LEO environment.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The present study investigates filtration forces of monoclonal antibody formulations in a small-scale set-up using polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) or polyethersulfone (PES) filters. Different factors like formulation composition and protein concentration related to differences in viscosity, as well as different filtration rates were evaluated. The present study showed that filtration behavior was influenced by the presence or absence of a surfactant in the formulation, which defines the interaction between filter membrane and surface active formulation components. This can lead to a change in filter resistance (PES filter) independent on the buffer system used. Filtration behavior was additionally defined by rheological non-Newtonian flow behavior. The data showed that high shear rates resulting from small pore sizes and filtration pressure up to 1.0 bar led to shear-thinning behavior for highly concentrated protein formulations. Differences in non-Newtonian behavior were attributed to ionic strength related to differences in repulsive and attractive interactions.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CCM alone against all the tested bacteria were 200-350 \u03bcg/ml, whereas those for EGCG were 300-600 \u03bcg/ml. Biofilm formation at one-half MICs indicated that CCM and EGCG alone respectively inhibited 52-68% and 59-78% of biofilm formation among all the tested bacteria.

The Center for Disease Control biofilm reactor containing a multispecies culture of nine bacteria with onehalf MIC of CCM (150 \u03bcg/ml) and EGCG (275 \u03bcg/ml) showed 17 and 14 \u03bcg/cm(2) of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane surface, whereas their combination (100 \u03bcg/ml of each) exhibited much lower EPS content (3 \u03bcg/cm(2)). Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations also illustrated that the combination of compounds tremendously reduced the biofilm thickness.

However, the sensitivity of fluorescence detection can be severely compromised by high background autofluorescence of various blotting membranes. Here, we describe a low autofluorescence PVDF membrane (Immobilon(\u00ae)-FL membrane) optimized for fluorescent immunodetection, and we report its use in the quantitative fluorescent western immunodetection of biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). First, membrane autofluorescence of four different commercially available blotting membranes was compared. Immobilon(\u00ae)-FL membrane exhibited the lowest autofluorescence with substantially increased detection sensitivity. We also show that the fluorescent immunodetection exhibited greatly increased linear dynamic range (two orders of magnitude, log scale) compared to the traditional chemiluminescent methods (less than one order of magnitude). Immobilon(\u00ae)-FL membrane was then used to quantify the expression levels of previously reported biomarkers associated with AD (synaptophysin, GSK3\u03b2, and GAP43). Total protein extracts from age-matched brain samples of three AD patients and three normal controls were used. Biomarker expression levels were normalized to that of a housekeeping protein (GAPDH) using multiplexed detection, conserving difficult-to-obtain biological tissue samples and minimizing experimental variation. We found that the expression of GSK3\u00df and GAP43 biomarkers were significantly reduced in AD brain samples compared to age-matched normal samples. In summary, combining fluorescent immunodetection with a low autofluorescent blotting membrane yields accurate and reliable multiplexed quantitation of AD biomarkers.

{"title": "A Double Transducer for High Precision Ultrasonic Time-Domain Reflectometry Measurements.", "abstract": "Membrane fouling, where unwanted particles accumulate on the membrane surface and reduce its permeability, causes problems in membrane filtration processes. With ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) it is possible to measure the extent of membrane fouling and hence take actions to minimize it. However, the usability of UTDR is very limited to constant filtration conditions if the sonic velocity, which has a great impact on UTDR measurement accuracy, is unknown. With a reference transducer the actual sonic velocity can be measured. This requires another transducer to be installed in the module, where there may be only limited space or the module dimensions may not be suitable for the reference transducer. A double transducer described in this study eliminates the need for a separate reference transducer because in the double transducer the reference measurement is included in the design of the transducer holder. Two sensors in the same holder require less space. Other advantage is that the double transducer can be placed near the measurement target and hence the local sonic velocity can be determined.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-07-02", "authors": ["SamStade", "TuomasHakkarainen", "MariKallioinen", "MikaM\u00e4ntt\u00e4ri", "TuureTuuva"], "doi": "10.3390/s150715090\n10.1016/j.seppur.2013.06.039\n10.1016/S1383-5866(00)00165-9\n10.1016/S0011-9164(98)00188-X\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00307-0\n10.1016/S0376-7388(99)00058-7\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00466-6\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00664-0\n10.1016/j.snb.2005.04.041\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.010\n10.1016/S0011-9164(00)00073-4\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00600-2\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19980906)69:10<2013::AID-APP13>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1016/j.memsci.2004.04.029\n10.3390/s140711682\n10.1007/BF02504405"}

It has already been approved as a new therapeutic modality and investigated in clinics, such as bone repair and regeneration, and oral surgery, with low cost-effectiveness ratio. At present, PRP is mostly prepared using a centrifuge. However, this method has several shortcomings, such as long preparation time (30\u00a0min), complexity in operation, and contamination of red blood cells (RBCs). In this paper, a new PRP preparation approach was proposed and tested. Ultrasound waves (4.5\u00a0MHz) generated from piezoelectric ceramics can establish standing waves inside a syringe filled with the whole blood. Subsequently, RBCs would accumulate at the locations of pressure nodes in response to acoustic radiation force, and the formed clusters would have a high speed of sedimentation. It is found that the PRP prepared by the proposed device can achieve higher platelet concentration and less RBCs contamination than a commercial centrifugal device, but similar growth factor (i.e., PDGF-\u03b2\u03b2). In addition, the sedimentation process under centrifugation and sonication was simulated using the Mason-Weaver equation and compared with each other to illustrate the differences between these two technologies and to optimize the design in the future.

Our previous design (6.5/30 MHz PMN-PT single crystal transducer) for intravascular contrast ultrasound imaging exhibited a contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) of 12 dB with a penetration depth of 2.5 mm. For improved penetration depth (>3 mm) and comparable contrast-to-tissue ratio (>12 dB), we evaluated a lower frequency 2/14 MHz PZT 1-3 composite transducer. Superharmonic imaging performance of this transducer and a detailed characterization of key parameters for acoustic angiography are presented. The 2/14 MHz arrangement demonstrated a -6 dB fractional bandwidth of 56.5% for the transmitter and 41.8% for the receiver, and produced sufficient peak-negative pressures (>1.5 MPa) at 2 MHz to induce a strong nonlinear harmonic response from microbubble contrast agents. In an in-vitro contrast ultrasound study using a tissue mimicking phantom and 200 \u03bcm cellulose microvessels, higher harmonic microbubble responses, from the 5th through the 7th harmonics, were detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16 dB. The microvessels were resolved in a two-dimensional image with a -6dB axial resolution of 615 \u03bcm (5.5 times the wavelength of 14 MHz waves) and a contrast-to-tissue ratio of 16 dB.

Additionally, this tracking technique reduces the topographical crosstalk while mapping the local electromechanical properties. The true drive amplitude, drive phase, contact resonant frequency and quality factor can be estimated from DART-PFM data obtained with vertically or torsionally vibrating cantilevers. This procedure yields a three-dimensional quantitative map of the local piezoelectric properties of the relaxor ferroelectric samples. With this approach, torsional DART allowed for the visualization of fine substructures within the monodomains, suggesting the existence of PNRs in relaxor ferroelectrics.

{"title": "Achieving synchronization with active hybrid materials: Coupling self-oscillating gels and piezoelectric films.", "abstract": "Lightweight, deformable materials that can sense and respond to human touch and motion can be the basis of future wearable computers, where the material itself will be capable of performing computations. To facilitate the creation of \"materials that compute\", we draw from two emerging modalities for computation: chemical computing, which relies on reaction-diffusion mechanisms to perform operations, and oscillatory computing, which performs pattern recognition through synchronization of coupled oscillators. Chemical computing systems, however, suffer from the fact that the reacting species are coupled only locally; the coupling is limited by diffusion as the chemical waves propagate throughout the system. Additionally, oscillatory computing systems have not utilized a potentially wearable material. To address both these limitations, we develop the first model for coupling self-oscillating polymer gels to a piezoelectric (PZ) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS). The resulting transduction between chemo-mechanical and electrical energy creates signals that can be propagated quickly over long distances and thus, permits remote, non-diffusively coupled oscillators to communicate and synchronize. Moreover, the oscillators can be organized into arbitrary topologies because the electrical connections lift the limitations of diffusive coupling. Using our model, we predict the synchronization behavior that can be used for computational tasks, ultimately enabling \"materials that compute\".", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-06-25", "authors": ["Victor VYashin", "Steven PLevitan", "Anna CBalazs"], "doi": "10.1038/srep11577"}

However, many researchers still have studied novel material synthesis and interfacial controls to improve the power production from PNGs. In this study, we report the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of PNGs dependent on mechanical deformations such as bending and twisting. Since the output power of PNGs is caused by the mechanical strain of the piezoelectric material, the power production and their ECE is critically dependent on the types of external mechanical deformations. Thus, we examine the output power from PNGs according to bending and twisting. In order to clearly understand the ECE of PNGs in the presence of those external mechanical deformations, we determine the ECE of PNGs by the ratio of output electrical energy and input mechanical energy, where we suggest that the input energy is based only on the strain energy of the piezoelectric layer. We calculate the strain energy of the piezoelectric layer using numerical simulation of bending and twisting of the PNG. Finally, we demonstrate that the ECE of the PNG caused by twisting is much higher than that caused by bending due to the multiple effects of normal and lateral piezoelectric coefficients.

By thermal polymerization, the 2-dA-MIM was cross-linked on the surface of a polyvinylidene-difluoride (PVDF) membrane.

Peri-implant sulcular fluid (PISF) was collected from four sites of each implant at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.

{"title": "Engineering nanostructured polymer blends with controlled nanoparticle location for excellent microwave absorption: a compartmentalized approach.", "abstract": "In order to obtain better materials, control over the precise location of nanoparticles is indispensable. It is shown here that ordered arrangements of nanoparticles, possessing different characteristics (electrical/magnetic dipoles), in the blend structure can result in excellent microwave absorption. This is manifested from a high reflection loss of ca. -67 dB for the best blend structure designed here. To attenuate electromagnetic radiation, the key parameters of high electrical conductivity and large dielectric/magnetic loss are targeted here by including a conductive material [multiwall carbon nanotubes, MWNTs], ferroelectric nanostructured material with associated relaxations in the GHz frequency [barium titanate, BT] and lossy ferromagnetic nanoparticles [nickel ferrite, NF]. In this study, bi-continuous structures were designed using 50/50 (by wt) blends of polycarbonate (PC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The MWNTs were modified using an electron acceptor molecule, a derivative of perylenediimide, which facilitates \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with the nanotubes and stimulates efficient charge transport in the blends. The nanoscopic materials have specific affinity towards the PVDF phase. Hence, by introducing surface-active groups, an ordered arrangement can be tailored. To accomplish this, both BT and NF were first hydroxylated followed by the introduction of amine-terminal groups on the surface. The latter facilitated nucleophilic substitution reactions with PC and resulted in their precise location. In this study, we have shown for the first time that by a compartmentalized approach, superior EM attenuation can be achieved. For instance, when the nanoparticles were localized exclusively in the PVDF phase or in both the phases, the minimum reflection losses were ca. -18 dB (for the MWNT/BT mixture) and -29 dB (for the MWNT/NF mixture), and the shielding occurred primarily through reflection. Interestingly, by adopting the compartmentalized approach wherein the lossy materials were in the PC phase and the conductive materials (MWNT) were in the PVDF phase, outstanding reflection losses of ca. -57 dB (for the BT and MWNT combination) and -67 dB (for the NF and MWNT combination) were noted and the shielding occurred primarily through absorption.

The presented structures exhibit Bragg band gaps that can be switched on or off by setting electrodes in short or open circuit. The band gap frequency width is determined by the electromechanical coupling coefficient. This property is used to design a Fabry-Perot cavity delimited by a periodic piezoelectric stack. An analytical model based on a transfer matrix formalism is used to model the wave propagation inside the structure. The cavity resonance tunability is obtained by varying the cavity length (i.e., by spatially shifting boundary conditions in the stack). 26% tuning of resonance and antiresonance frequencies with almost constant electromechanical coupling coefficient of 5% are theoretically predicted for an NCE41 resonator. To optimize the device, the influence of various parameters is theoretically investigated. The cavity length, phononic crystal (number and length of unit cells), and transducer position can be adapted to tune the frequency shift and the coupling coefficient. When the transducer is located at a nodal plane of the cavity, the value of the coupling coefficient is 30%.

{"title": "On the acceleration sensitivity and its active reduction by edge electrodes in AT-cut quartz resonators.", "abstract": "Incremental piezoelectric equations for small vibrations superposed on initial deformations are presented. The equations are implemented in COMSOL finite element models (FEA). Equations are validated by comparing the results for the force sensitivity coefficient Kf of a circular quartz plate subjected to a pair of diametrical forces with measured data. The model results show a consistent trend with the experimental results, and the relative difference between our FEA results and Ballato's measured result is about 13%. A detailed study of the acceleration sensitivity of a rectangular AT-cut quartz plate is presented. The plate resonator is fixed along one edge as a cantilever. For AT-cut quartz resonators with the crystal digonal X-axis perpendicular to plate X-axis, the in-plane acceleration sensitivity is found to be negligible compared with the out-of-plane (Y-axis) acceleration sensitivity. For AT-cut quartz resonators with the crystal digonal X-axis parallel to plate X-axis, the Y-axis acceleration sensitivity is found to be rectified, that is the fractional change in frequency is positive with respect to both positive and negative Y-axis accelerations. The Y-axis acceleration sensitivity is small in comparison with the in-plane acceleration sensitivity for small body forces. However, for large body forces, the Y-axis acceleration sensitivity dominates because it increases nonlinearly with the Y-axis acceleration. The resonator rectified acceleration sensitivity is confirmed by phase noise measurements. For reduced acceleration sensitivity, two pairs of electrodes along the plate edges reduce the bending of the plate resonator and subsequently reduce acceleration sensitivity. We present a new method using these edge electrodes in which a dc bias field is employed to control the resonant frequency of resonator subjected to g body forces. A dc bias field with an appropriate dc bias voltage could potentially yield a reduction of acceleration sensitivity in Y-axis direction of about two orders of magnitude.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-06-13", "authors": ["JianfengChen", "Yook-KongYong", "RandallKubena", "DeborahKirby", "DavidChang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006895"}

The effect of the dopant element into AlN on the crystal structure, and piezoelectric properties of co-doped AlN was determined on the basis of a first-principles calculation, and the theoretical piezoelectric properties were confirmed by experimentally depositing thin films of magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) co-doped AlN (Mg-Zr-doped AlN). The Mg-Zrdoped AlN thin films were prepared on Si (100) substrates by using a triple-radio-frequency magnetron reactive co-sputtering system. The crystal structures and piezoelectric coefficients (d33) were investigated as a function of the concentrations, which were measured by X-ray diffraction and a piezometer. The results show that the d33 of Mg-Zr-doped AlN at total Mg and Zr concentrations (both expressed as \u03b2) of 0.35 was 280% larger than that of pure AlN. The experimentally measured parameter of the crystal structure and d33 of Mg-Zr-doped AlN (plotted as functions of total Mg and Zr concentrations) were in very close agreement with the corresponding values obtained by the first-principle calculations.

Applying a tensile force to carbon fiber bundles used as Li-intercalating electrodes results in a response of the electrode potential of a few millivolts which allows, at low current densities, lithiation at higher electrode potential than delithiation.

A layer of special damping coating was deposited around the resonators and on the part of electrodes to suppress parasitic oscillations induced mainly by Lamb waves. Frequency dependences of the real and imaginary parts of electric impedance/admittance were measured for every resonator to find resonant frequency and Q-factor with series and parallel resonances. The optimal values of width of electrode coating for every resonator were revealed which provide good resonance quality. The measurements of parameter S12, which characterizes a degree of acoustical coupling between the resonators, have shown its value to be higher than 50dB in the absolute value in all the cases considered. This means that the resonators under study are entirely acoustically decoupled.

The laryngeal elevation as well as the speed of the laryngeal elevation is influenced significantly by the consistency to be swallowed. The breathing pattern changes from saliva to solid food of inspiration/swallow/inspiration to expiration/swallow/expiration. A change of body position influences the parameters specific for swallowing and the breathing patterns significantly.\nThis study demonstrates that body position affects coordination of breathing and swallowing and swallow-related parameters in healthy subjects.

{"title": "Compensating for Tissue Changes in an Ultrasonic Power Link for Implanted Medical Devices.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic power transfer using piezoelectric devices is a promising wireless power transfer technology for biomedical implants. However, for sub-dermal implants where the separation between the transmitter and receiver is on the order of several acoustic wavelengths, the ultrasonic power transfer efficiency (PTE) is highly sensitive to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. This sensitivity can cause large swings in efficiency and presents a serious limitation on battery life and overall performance. A practical ultrasonic transcutaneous energy transfer (UTET) system design must accommodate different implant depths and unpredictable acoustic changes caused by tissue growth, hydration, ambient temperature, and movement. This paper describes a method used to compensate for acoustic separation distance by varying the transmit (Tx) frequency in a UTET system. In a benchtop UTET system we experimentally show that without compensation, power transfer efficiency can range from 9% to 25% as a 5 mm porcine tissue sample is manipulated to simulate in situ implant conditions. Using an active frequency compensation method, we show that the power transfer efficiency can be kept uniformly high, ranging from 20% to 27%. The frequency compensation strategy we propose is low-power, non-invasive, and uses only transmit-side measurements, making it suitable for active implanted medical device applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2015-06-09", "authors": ["HugoVihvelin", "JeffLeadbetter", "ManoharBance", "Jeremy ABrown", "Robert B AAdamson"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2421823"}

Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve was used to induce esophageal contractions.

Animal studies revealed muscular connections between the LM and CM layers of the LES but not in the esophagus. During vagal stimulated esophageal contraction there was relative movement between the LM and CM. Human studies show that LM-to-CM (LM/CM) thickness ratio at baseline was 1. At the peak of swallow-induced contraction LM/CM ratio decreased significantly (<1), whereas the reverse was the case during TLESR (>2).

Being in the near field of the strongly confined photonic or plasmonic mode, cantilever is efficiently actuated and its response is directly read out using the same waveguide, which results in a very high sensitivity and capability of single-molecule detection even in atmosphere.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-06-05", "authors": ["Dmitry YuFedyanin", "Yury VStebunov"], "doi": "10.1038/srep10968"}
{"title": "Longitudinal modes along thin piezoelectric waveguides for liquid sensing applications.", "abstract": "The propagation of longitudinally polarized acoustic modes along thin piezoelectric plates (BN, ZnO, InN, AlN and GaN) is theoretically studied, aiming at the design of high frequency electroacoustic devices suitable for work in liquid environments. The investigation of the acoustic field profile across the plate revealed the presence of longitudinally polarized Lamb modes, travelling at velocities close to that of the longitudinal bulk acoustic wave propagating in the same direction. Such waves are suitable for the implementation of high-frequency, low-loss electroacoustic devices operating in liquid environments. The time-averaged power flow density, the phase velocity and the electroacoustic coupling coefficient K2 dispersion curves were studied, for the first (S0) and four higher order (S1, S2, S3, S4) symmetrical modes for different electrical boundary conditions. Two electroacoustic coupling configurations were investigated, based on interdigitated transducers, with or without a metal floating electrode at the opposite plate surface. Enhanced performances, such as a K2 as high as 8.5% and a phase velocity as high as 16,700 m/s, were demostrated for the ZnO- and BN-based waveguides, as an example. The relative velocity changes, and the inertial and viscous sensitivities of the first symmetric and anti-symmetric mode, S0 and A0, propagating along thin plates bordered by a viscous liquid were derived using the perturbation approach. The present study highlights the feasibility of the piezoelectric waveguides to the development of high-frequency, integrated-circuits compatible electroacoustic devices suitable for working in liquid environment.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-06-05", "authors": ["CinziaCaliendo"], "doi": "10.3390/s150612841\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.105\n10.1121/1.418506\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1650\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1665106\n10.1016/S0042-207X(00)00343-2\n10.3390/s150202525\n10.1088/0022-3727/31/20/001\n10.1016/S0040-6090(03)00889-7\n10.1063/1.3193655\n10.1155/2012/853021\n10.1016/0041-624X(95)00021-T"}

In addition, we were able to improve the piezoelectric effect by 1.85 times from 40 \u00b1 2 to 74 \u00b1 2 pm/V when compared to the thin film counterpart, which contributes to the more efficient current generation under a given stress, by making an effective use of the P(VDF-TrFE) thin top layer as well as the side walls. We attribute the enhancement of piezoelectric effects to the contributions from the shell component and the strain confinement effect, which was supported by our modeling results.

The device can detect photons with energies significantly smaller (2.2 eV) than the band gap of ZnO (3.2 eV) and ZnS (3.7 eV), which is mainly attributed to spatially indirect type-II transition facilitated by the abrupt interface between the ZnO core and ZnS shell.

The piezoelectric energy harvester was made with non-electrically poled Fe-RGO/PVDF nanocomposite film that gives an open circuit output voltage and short circuit current up to 5.1 V and 0.254 \u03bcA by repetitive human finger imparting. The improvement of the output performance is influenced by the generation of the electroactive polar \u03b3-phase in the PVDF, due to the electrostatic interactions among the -CH2-/-CF2- dipoles of PVDF and the delocalized \u03c0-electrons and remaining oxygen functionalities of Fe-doped RGO via ion-dipole and/or hydrogen bonding interactions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the nucleation of the polar \u03b3-phase of PVDF by electrostatic interactions and Raman spectroscopy also supported the molecular interactions between the dipoles of PVDF and the Fe-doped RGO nanosheets. In addition, the nanocomposite shows a higher electrical energy density of \u22480.84 J cm(-3) at an electric field of 537 kV cm(-1), which indicates that it is appropriate for energy storage capabilities.

In this study, we found that the cellular localization of PKB/Akt kinase affects the maintenance of CSCs. When Akt tagged with nuclear localization signal (Akt-NLS) was overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB468 cells, these cells showed a 10-15% increase in the number of cells with CSCs enhanced ALDH activity and demonstrated a CD44(+High)/CD24(-Low) phenotype. This effect was completely reversed in the presence of Akt-specific inhibitor, triciribine. Furthermore, cells overexpressing Akt or Akt-NLS were less likely to be in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by inactivating p21(Waf1/Cip1) and exhibited increased clonogenicity and proliferation as assayed by colony-forming assay (mammosphere formation). Thus, our data emphasize the importance the intracellular localization of Akt has on stemness in human breast cancer cells. It also indicates a new robust way for improving the enrichment and culture of CSCs for experimental purposes. Hence, it allows for the development of simpler protocols to study stemness, clonogenic potency, and screening of new chemotherapeutic agents that preferentially target cancer stem cells.\nThe presented data, (i) shows new, stemness-promoting role of nuclear Akt/PKB kinase, (ii) it underlines the effects of nuclear Akt on cell cycle regulation, and finally (iii) it suggests new ways to study cancer stem-like cells.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2015-06-02", "authors": ["Mayur VilasJain", "Jaganmohan RJangamreddy", "JerzyGrabarek", "FrankSchweizer", "ThomasKlonisch", "ArturCie\u015blar-Pobuda", "Marek J\u0141os"], "doi": "10.1080/15384101.2015.1041692\n10.1093/carcin/bgu045\n10.1016/B978-0-12-800097-7.00005-1\n10.1073/pnas.0530291100\n10.1038/ni1080\n10.1038/nature03128\n10.1038/nature05372\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2030\n10.1073/pnas.0610117104\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2018\n10.1007/s00005-008-0023-4\n10.1016/j.molmed.2008.08.003\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.04.011\n10.1007/s00018-008-8111-5\n10.1038/onc.2008.245\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.11.008\n10.1074/jbc.275.11.8027\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207059\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.615\n10.1006/excr.1999.4701\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.481\n10.1002/jcb.20549\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.01.011\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210202\n10.1128/MCB.00668-08\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2004.01.002\n10.1002/bies.200900005\n10.1023/B:APPT.0000045801.15585.dd\n10.1038/nm761\n10.1038/35060032\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209307\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237156\n10.1002/cyto.a.22437\n10.1161/01.RES.0000124394.01180.BE\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.02113.x\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.08.030\n10.1089/scd.2010.0130\n10.1073/pnas.0802785105\n10.1002/jcp.22407\n10.1007/s00005-012-0205-y\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.10.004\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090477\n10.1586/erm.11.21\n10.1038/35102167\n10.1016/j.gde.2005.12.008\n10.1042/BJ20110040\n10.1046/j.1440-1711.2002.01061.x"}

A few ways of producing this mode stimulation, namely vibro-impact or forced excitation, as well as its application for energy harvesting devices are proposed. The paper presents numerical and experimental analyses of novel structural dynamics effects along with an optimal configuration of the cantilever beam. The peculiarities of a cantilever beam vibrating in the third mode are related to the significant increase of the level of deformations capable of extracting significant additional amounts of energy compared to the conventional harvester vibrating in the first mode. Two types of a piezoelectric vibrating energy harvester (PVEH) prototype are analysed in this paper: the first one without electrode segmentation, while the second is segmented using electrode segmentation at the strain nodes of the third vibration mode to achieve effective operation at the third resonant frequency. The results of this research revealed that the voltage generated by any segment of the segmented PVEH prototype excited at the third resonant frequency demonstrated a 3.4-4.8-fold increase in comparison with the non-segmented prototype. Simultaneously, the efficiency of the energy harvester prototype also increased at lower resonant frequencies from 16% to 90%.

{"title": "Ultra-high frequency piezoelectric aptasensor for the label-free detection of cocaine.", "abstract": "This paper describes a label-free and real-time piezoelectric aptasensor for the detection of cocaine. The acoustic wave sensing platform is a quartz substrate functionalized with an adlayer of S-(11-trichlorosilyl-undecanyl)-benzenethiosulfonate (BTS) cross-linker onto which the anti-cocaine MN4 DNA aptamer is next immobilized. Preparation of the sensor surface was monitored using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the binding of cocaine to surface-attached MN4 was evaluated using the electromagnetic piezoelectric acoustic sensor (EMPAS). The MN4 aptamer, unlike other cocaine aptamer variants, has its secondary structure preformed in the unbound state with only tertiary structure changes occurring during target binding. It is postulated that the highly sensitive EMPAS detected the binding of cocaine through target mass loading coupled to aptamer tertiary structure folding. The sensor achieved an apparent Kd of 45 \u00b1 12 \u00b5M, and a limit of detection of 0.9 \u00b5M. Repeated regenerability of the sensor platform was also demonstrated. This work constitutes the first application of EMPAS technology in the field of aptasensors. Furthermore, it is so far one of the very few examples of a bulk acoustic wave aptasensor that is able to directly detect the binding interaction between an aptamer and a small molecule in a facile one-step protocol without the use of a complex assay or signal amplification step.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2015-05-30", "authors": ["Miguel A DNeves", "ChristopheBlaszykowski", "SumraBokhari", "MichaelThompson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.038"}

There is an assumption in literature that progenitor cells in FB sarcomas originate from vascular endothelium cells feeding a connective tissue capsule that forms around foreign body. In our research, we studied mRNA expression of one of the endothelial cell markers--receptor VEGFR2/FIk1--and growth factor VEGF-A, which interacts with it, in precancerous cells of FB sarcomas in mice. In examined cells, mRNA expression of VEGF-A was found while mRNA expression of VEGFR2/FIk1 was absent. In light of this and formerly established properties of progenitor cells in FB sarcomas, possibilities of the origin of these sarcomas from endothelial cells, pericytes, and pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are being discussed.", "journal": "Ontogenez", "date": "2015-05-30", "authors": ["O VMorozova", "A FKaramysheva", "T GMoizhess"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Simultaneous removal of phosphorus and EfOM using MIEX, coagulation, and low-pressure membrane filtration.", "abstract": "The feasibility of using magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) treatment, in-line alum coagulation, and low-pressure membrane filtration was investigated for the simultaneous removal of total phosphorus (TP) and effluent organic matter (EfOM) from biologically treated wastewater. The focus was also placed on minimizing fouling of polyvinylidene fluoride and polyethersulfone membranes, which are the most commonly used low-pressure membranes in new and retrofit wastewater treatment plants. MIEX alone was effective for the removal of EfOM, and MIEX plus a small alum dose was very effective in removing both EfOM and TP. MIEX removed phosphorus, but organic acids in EfOM were preferentially removed, and the effects of competing anions on the removal of EfOM were insignificant. All the pretreatment strategies decreased the resistance to filtration. The greatest decrease in fouling was achieved by using MIEX (15\u2005mL\u2005L\u207b\u00b9) plus a very low dose of alum (\u223c0.5\u2005mg\u2005Al\u2005L\u207b\u00b9). Sweep floc coagulation using alum and without MIEX also significantly decreased fouling but did not effectively remove EfOM and produced high floc volume that could be problematic for inside-out hollow-fibre modules. The addition of these reagents into rapid mix followed by membrane filtration would provide operational simplicity and could be easily retrofitted at existing membrane filtration facilities.", "journal": "Environmental technology", "date": "2015-05-29", "authors": ["Hyun-ChulKim", "Thomas CTimmes", "Brian ADempsey"], "doi": "10.1080/09593330.2015.1055819"}

To date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels and whether other modes of activation exist is not known. In this study, we screened ~3.25 million compounds using a cell-based fluorescence assay and identified a synthetic small molecule we termed Yoda1 that acts as an agonist for both human and mouse Piezo1. Functional studies in cells revealed that Yoda1 affects the sensitivity and the inactivation kinetics of mechanically induced responses. Characterization of Yoda1 in artificial droplet lipid bilayers showed that Yoda1 activates purified Piezo1 channels in the absence of other cellular components. Our studies demonstrate that Piezo1 is amenable to chemical activation and raise the possibility that endogenous Piezo1 agonists might exist.

We employ a perturbation approach where the flow variables are divided into first- and second-order fields. We use impedance boundary conditions to model the PDMS microchannel walls and we model the acoustic actuation by a displacement function from the literature based on a numerical study of piezoelectric actuation. Consistent with the type of actuation, the obtained first-order field is a horizontal standing wave that travels vertically from the actuated wall towards the upper PDMS wall. This is in contrast to what is observed in bulk acoustic wave devices. The first-order fields drive the acoustic streaming, as well as the time-averaged acoustic radiation force acting on suspended particles. We analyze the motion of suspended particles driven by the acoustic streaming drag and the radiation force. We examine a range of particle diameters to demonstrate the transition from streaming-drag-dominated acoustophoresis to radiation-force-dominated acoustophoresis.

A detailed description of the full methodology required to calculate the piezoelectric properties of ScAlN, with application to other complex alloys, is presented.

In vivo, these EFs may influence cell migration, a vital component of wound healing. As a result, the application of small external EFs to bone fractures and cutaneous wounds is actively practiced clinically. Due to the significant regenerative potential of stem cells in bone and cartilage healing, and their potential role in the observed improved healing in vivo post applied EFs, using a novel medium throughput device, we investigated the impacts of physiological and aphysiological EFs on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) for up to 15 hours.

We observed variability in hBM-MSC donor-to-donor responses and overall tolerances to applied EFs. This study thus confirms hBM-MSCs are responsive to applied EFs, and their rate of migration towards the cathode is controllable depending on the EF strength, providing new insight into the physiology of hBM-MSCs and possibly a significant opportunity for the utilisation of EFs in directed scaffold colonisation in vitro for tissue engineering applications or in vivo post implantation.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2015-05-20", "authors": ["T ABanks", "P S BLuckman", "J EFrith", "J JCooper-White"], "doi": "10.1039/c4ib00297k"}

There is a high demand for miniaturized, low-powered, lightweight and robust sensors that can perform sensing on URVs to improve their control and maneuverability. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication and experimental testing of two types of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors that benefit the situational awareness and control of a robotic stingray. The first one is a piezoresistive liquid crystal polymer haircell flow sensor which is employed to determine the velocity of propagation of the stingray. The second one is Pb(Zr(0.52)Ti(0.48))O3 piezoelectric micro-diaphragm pressure sensor which measures various flapping parameters of the stingray's fins that are key parameters to control the robot locomotion. The polymer flow sensors determine that by increasing the flapping frequency of the fins from 0.5 to 3 Hz the average velocity of the stingray increases from 0.05 to 0.4 BL s(-1), respectively. The role of these sensors in detecting errors in control and functioning of the actuators in performing tasks like flapping at a desired amplitude and frequency, swimming at a desired velocity and direction are quantified. The proposed sensors are also used to provide inputs for a model predictive control which allows the robot to track a desired trajectory.

This manifested in an impressive 108% increment in the tensile strength and 48% increment in the Young's modulus with 3 wt% PMMA wrapped MWNTs in striking contrast to the neat blends. As the PMMA wrapped MWNTs localized at the interface of PVDF-ABS blends, the electrical conductivity could be tuned with respect to only MWNTs, which were selectively localized in the PVDF phase, driven by thermodynamics. The electromagnetic shielding properties were assessed using a vector network analyser in a broad range of frequency, X-band (8-12 GHz) and Ku-band (12-18 GHz). Interestingly, enhanced EM shielding was achieved by this unique approach.

Here, a patterned electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pulling technology was proposed to fabricate a new self-connected, piezoelectric fiber array vertically integrated P(VDF-TrFE) nanogenerator, with a molecular poling orientation fully aligned to the principal excitation for maximized conversion and a well-bridged electrode pair for efficient charge collection. The nanogenerator is fabricated in a novel way by applying a voltage across an electrode pair sandwiching an air gap and an array of shallow micropillars, during which the EHD force tends to pull the micropillars upward, generating a microfiber array finally in robust contact with the upper electrode. Such a thermoplastic and EHD deformation of the microfibers, featured simultaneously by an electric field and by a microfiber elongation dominantly vertical to the electrode, leads to a poling orientation of P(VDF-TrFE) well coincident with the principal strain for the generator excited by a force normal to the electrodes. The as-prepared piezoelectric device exhibits an enhanced output voltage up to 4.0 V and a current of 2.6 \u03bcA, therefore the piezoelectric voltage was enhanced to 5.4 times that from the bulk film.

{"title": "The effect of conventional surgery and piezoelectric surgery bone harvesting techniques on the donor site morbidity of the mandibular ramus and symphysis.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity following bone harvesting at two different intraoral donor sites, mandibular symphysis and ramus, and to determine the effects of piezoelectric and conventional surgical graft harvesting techniques on donor site morbidity. Intraoral block bone grafts were harvested from the symphysis (n=44) and ramus (n=31). The two donor site groups were divided into two subgroups according to the surgical graft harvesting method used (conventional or piezoelectric surgery). Intraoperative and postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Donor site morbidity and the harvesting techniques were compared statistically. Of 290 teeth evaluated in the symphysis group, four needed root canal treatment after surgery. The incidence of transient paresthesia in the mucosa was significantly higher in the symphysis group than in the ramus group (P=0.004). In the symphysis group, the incidence of temporary skin and mucosa paresthesia was lower in the piezoelectric surgery subgroup than in the conventional surgery subgroup (P=0.006 and P=0.001, respectively). No permanent anaesthesia of any region of the skin was reported in either donor site group. VAS scores did not differ between the ramus and symphysis harvesting groups, or between the piezoelectric and conventional surgery subgroups. When the symphysis was chosen as the donor site, minor sensory disturbances of the mucosa and teeth were recorded. The use of piezoelectric surgery during intraoral harvesting of bone blocks, especially from the symphysis, can reduce these complications.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2015-05-17", "authors": ["NAltiparmak", "S SSoydan", "SUckan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2015.04.009"}

The present study aimed to identify novel citrullinated proteins in 10 tumor cell lines by 2-D Western blotting (2-D WB).\nTwo identical two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels were prepared using extracts from ten cultured human tumor cell lines: ECA(esophageal cancer cells), HEPG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma cells), SKOV3 (ovarian cancer cells), MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), H292 (lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells), HeLa (cervical cancer cells), Lovo (colon cancer cells), OS-RC (renal cell carcinoma cells), PANC-1 (pancreatic cancer cells), and SGC (gastric cancer cells). The expression profiles on one 2-DE gels were trans-blotted to PVDF membranes, and the blots were then probed with an anti-citrulline antibody. By comparing the 2-DE profile with the parallel 2-D WB profile at a global level, protein spots with immuno-signals were collected from the second 2-DE gel and identified using mass spectrometry.

{"title": "Investigation of a rotary ultrasonic motor using a longitudinal vibrator and spiral fin rotor.", "abstract": "A Langevin transducer can provide longitudinal vibration with larger amplitude while also possessing a greater fatigue life than other types of piezoelectric vibrators. A novel rotary Ultrasonic Motor (USM) was proposed based on the use of a longitudinal transducer (acting as the stator) and a spiral fin rotor: the front cover of the Langevin transducer was designed as a double-layer cup-shaped structure, with the rotor sustained by the inner-layer, and the bearing cover fixed to the outer-layer; the rotor consisted of a shaft and spiral fins which acted as the elastic coupler. It is different from a traditional traveling USM, because the stator provides longitudinal vibration and the rotor generates the elliptical motion. This paper analyzed the motion locus equation of the fin contact points. Additionally, a theoretical analysis was performed in regards to the mechanism and the motor's rotor motion characteristics, which demonstrates the relationships among the motor's driving force, the torque, the revolution speed, and the motor structure parameters.

The laser contains two strong, wavelength-matched Bragg gratings photoinscribed in an Er-doped fiber and emits two polarization modes when pumped with a 980\u00a0nm laser diode. By beating the two modes, a microwave signal with a signal-to-noise ratio over 60\u00a0dB can be obtained. For a free running laser the fluctuations in intensity and frequency of the microwave signal are \u00b11\u2009\u2009dB and \u00b15\u2009\u2009kHz, respectively, and the noise level is about -40\u2009\u2009dBc/Hz at 1\u00a0kHz. The frequency can be continuously tuned from 1.8 to 15.1\u00a0GHz, by transversely loading the laser cavity and changing the intracavity birefringence by use of a piezoelectric transducer-based mechanical device. The measured response time rate of tuning is about 90\u00a0MHz/\u03bcs and the intensity fluctuation at different frequencies is less than \u00b11.5\u2009\u2009dB.

It is found that the crystallographic polar axes of the P(VDF-TrFE) nanotubes are oriented along the nanotubes long axes. Such a desired crystal orientation is due to the kinetic selection mechanism for lamellae growth confined in the nanopores. The preferred crystal orientation in nanotubes leads to huge piezoelectric coefficients of the P(VDF-TrFE). The piezoelectric strain and voltage coefficients of P(VDF-TrFE) nanotube array are observed to be 1.97 and 3.40 times of those for conventional spin coated film. Such a significant performance enhancement is attributed to the well-controlled polarization orientation, the elimination of the substrate constraint, and the low dielectric constant of the nanotube array.

Here, we investigate exciton FSS in self-organized lateral InAs/GaAs quantum-dot molecular structures (QMSs) including laterally aligned double quantum dots (DQDs), quantum-dot clusters (QCs), and quantum rings (QRs), by employing polarization-resolved microphotoluminescence (\u03bcPL) spectroscopy. We find a clear trend in FSS between the studied QMSs depending on their geometric arrangements, from a large FSS in the DQDs to a smaller FSS in the QCs and QRs. This trend is accompanied by a corresponding difference in the optical polarization directions of the excitons between these QMSs, namely, the bright-exciton lines are linearly polarized preferably along or perpendicular to the [11\u03050] crystallographic axis in the DQDs that also defines the alignment direction of the two constituting QDs, whereas in the QCs and QRs, the polarization directions are randomly oriented. We attribute the observed trend in the FSS to a significant reduction of the asymmetry in the lateral confinement potential of the excitons in the QRs and QCs as compared with the DQDs, as a result of a compensation between the effects of lateral shape anisotropy and piezoelectric field. Our work demonstrates that FSS strongly depends on the geometric arrangements of the QMSs, which effectively tune the degree of the compensation effects and are capable of reducing FSS even in a strained QD system to a limit similar to strain-free QDs.

{"title": "Multicarrier airborne ultrasound transmission with piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "In decentralized localization systems, the received signal has to be assigned to the sender. Therefore, longrange airborne ultrasound communication enables the transmission of an identifier of the sender within the ultrasound signal to the receiver. Further, in areas with high electromagnetic noise or electromagnetic free areas, ultrasound communication is an alternative. Using code division multiple access (CDMA) to transmit data is ineffective in rooms due to high echo amplitudes. Further, piezoelectric transducers generate a narrow-band ultrasound signal, which limits the data rate. This work shows the use of multiple carrier frequencies in orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) and differential quadrature phase shift keying modulation with narrowband piezoelectric devices to achieve a packet length of 2.1 ms. Moreover, the adapted channel coding increases data rate by correcting transmission errors. As a result, a 2-carrier ultrasound transmission system on an embedded system achieves a data rate of approximately 5.7 kBaud. Within the presented work, a transmission range up to 18 m with a packet error rate (PER) of 13% at 10-V supply voltage is reported. In addition, the transmission works up to 22 m with a PER of 85%.

The results showed that patients on hemodialysis have sleep disorders, and that sleep disorders are common in group I and II than control group.

{"title": "Ionic Selectivity and Permeation Properties of Human PIEZO1 Channels.", "abstract": "Members of the eukaryotic PIEZO family (the human orthologs are noted hPIEZO1 and hPIEZO2) form cation-selective mechanically-gated channels. We characterized the selectivity of human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) for alkali ions: K+, Na+, Cs+ and Li+; organic cations: TMA and TEA, and divalents: Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+. All monovalent ions permeated the channel. At a membrane potential of -100 mV, Cs+, Na+ and K+ had chord conductances in the range of 35-55 pS with the exception of Li+, which had a significantly lower conductance of ~ 23 pS. The divalents decreased the single-channel permeability of K+, presumably because the divalents permeated slowly and occupied the open channel for a significant fraction of the time. In cell-attached mode, 90 mM extracellular divalents had a conductance for inward currents carried by the divalents of: 25 pS for Ba2+ and 15 pS for Ca2+ at -80 mV and 10 pS for Mg2+ at -50 mV. The organic cations, TMA and TEA, permeated slowly and attenuated K+ currents much like the divalents.

Using this, environmentally friendly single-crystalline NaxK1-xNbO3 (NKN) piezoelectric nano-rod arrays were successfully synthesized by conventional pulsed-laser deposition and demonstrated to have a remarkably enhanced piezoelectric performance. The shape of the nano-structure was also found to be easily manipulated by varying the energy conditions of the physical vapor.

{"title": "FOXQ1 mediates the crosstalk between TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt signaling pathways in the progression of colorectal cancer.", "abstract": "A wide variety of signaling transduction pathways contribute to tumorigenesis. Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1) is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family and its upregulation is closely correlated with tumor progression and prognosis of multiple cancer types, including colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FOXQ1 promotes tumorigenesis, especially cancer cell invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer, have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that FOXQ1 is overexpressed in colorectal tumor tissues and its expression level is closely correlated with the stage and lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer. In in vitro cultured SW480 colorectal cancer cells, knockdown of FOXQ1 expression by small interfering RNA greatly diminished the aggressive tumor behaviors of SW480 cells, including angiogenesis, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic investigation showed that FOXQ1 silencing prevents the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, thus reducing the activity of Wnt signaling. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 induced the expression of FOXQ1 as well as the migration and invasion of SW480 cells, which was partially prevented following knockdown of FOXQ1. Our results demonstrate that FOXQ1 plays a critical role during the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer and is a mediator of the crosstalk between Wnt and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways.

{"title": "Resistive switching and polarization reversal of hydrothermal-method-grown undoped zinc oxide nanorods by using scanning probe microscopy techniques.", "abstract": "This paper reports the localized electrical, polarization reversal, and piezoelectric properties of the individual hexagonal ZnO nanorods, which are grown via the hydrothermal method and textured with [0001] orientation. The studies are conducted with conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques. The correlation between the resistance switching and polarization reversal is discussed. The c-AFM results show that there is less variation on the set or reset voltage in nanorod samples, compared to that of the ZnO thin film. With increasing aspect ratio of the nanorods, both set and reset voltages are decreased. The nanorods with low aspect ratio show unipolar resistance switching, whereas both unipolar and bipolar resistance switching are observed when the aspect ratio is larger than 0.26. The PFM results further show the ferroelectric-like property in the nanorods. Comparing with that of the ZnO thin film, the enhanced piezoresponse in the nanorods can be attributed to the size effect. In addition, the piezoresponse force spectroscopy (PFS) experiments are conducted in ambient air, synthetic air, and argon gas. It shows that the depolarization field in the nanorod may be due to the moisture in the environment; moreover, the increased piezoresponse may relate to the absence of oxygen in the environment. It is also shown that the piezoelectric responses increase nonlinearly with the aspect ratio of the nanorods. By comparing the piezoresponse hysteresis loops obtained from the nanorod samples of as-grown, air-annealed and vacuum-annealed, it is found that the oxygen vacancies are the origin of the polarization reversal in ZnO nanorods. Finally, the tradeoff between the electrical and ferroelectric-like properties is also observed.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-05-09", "authors": ["JuanxiuXiao", "Wei LiOng", "ZimingGuo", "Ghim WeiHo", "KaiyangZeng"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b01988"}

{"title": "Unfolding grain size effects in barium titanate ferroelectric ceramics.", "abstract": "Grain size effects on the physical properties of polycrystalline ferroelectrics have been extensively studied for decades; however there are still major controversies regarding the dependence of the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties on the grain size. Dense BaTiO3 ceramics with different grain sizes were fabricated by either conventional sintering or spark plasma sintering using micro- and nano-sized powders. The results show that the grain size effect on the dielectric permittivity is nearly independent of the sintering method and starting powder used. A peak in the permittivity is observed in all the ceramics with a grain size near 1\u2005\u03bcm and can be attributed to a maximum domain wall density and mobility. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 and remnant polarization Pr show diverse grain size effects depending on the particle size of the starting powder and sintering temperature. This suggests that besides domain wall density, other factors such as back fields and point defects, which influence the domain wall mobility, could be responsible for the different grain size dependence observed in the dielectric and piezoelectric/ferroelectric properties. In cases where point defects are not the dominant contributor, the piezoelectric constant d33 and the remnant polarization Pr increase with increasing grain size.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-05-08", "authors": ["YongqiangTan", "JialiangZhang", "YanqingWu", "ChunleiWang", "VladimirKoval", "BaoguiShi", "HaitaoYe", "RuthMcKinnon", "GiuseppeViola", "HaixueYan"], "doi": "10.1038/srep09953"}

Laser bone cutting is proven to have higher accuracy and to increase bone healing compared to conventional mechanical bone cutting. But the reason of subsequent better healing is not biologically explained yet. In this study we present our experience with an integrated miniaturized laser system mounted on a surgical lightweight robotic arm.\nAn Erbium-doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Er:YAG) laser and a piezoelectric (PZE) osteotome were used for comparison. In six grown up female G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, comparative surgical interventions were done on the edentulous mandibular ridge. Our laser system was used to create different shapes of bone defects on the left side of the mandible. On the contralateral side, similar bone defects were created by PZE osteotome. Small bone samples were harvested to compare the immediate post-operative cut surface.\nThe analysis of the cut surface of the laser osteotomy and conventional mechanical osteotomy revealed an essential difference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed biologically open cut surfaces from the laser osteotomy. The samples from PZE osteotomy showed a flattened tissue structure over the cut surface, resembling the \"smear layer\" from tooth preparation.\nWe concluded that our new finding with the mechanical osteotomy suggests a biological explanation to the expected difference in subsequent bone healing. Our hypothesis is that the difference of surface characteristic yields to different bleeding pattern and subsequently results in different bone healing.

This is the first NAC reported in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and its magnitude, clearly visible and by far the highest of all known materials, can be reversibly tuned by exchanging guests adsorbed from hydrostatic fluids. This counterintuitive strong NAC of [Zn(L)2(OH)2]n\u00b7Guest arises from the interplay of flexible [-Zn-O(H)-]n helices with layers of [-Zn-L-]4 quadrangular puckered rings comprising large channel voids. The compression of helices and flattening of puckered rings combine to give a giant piezo-mechanical response, applicable in ultrasensitive sensors and actuators.

A quadrilateral double socket was custom made and instrumented with two force sensing resistors (FSR) attached to specific anterior and posterior sites of the socket's wall. A second setup was established by attaching three piezoelectric sensors at the anterior distal, anterior proximal, and posterior sites. Gait cycle and locomotion movements such as stair ascent and sit to stand were adopted to characterize the validity of the technique. FSR and piezoelectric outputs were measured with reference to the knee angle during each phase. Piezoelectric sensors could identify the movement of midswing and terminal swing, pre-full standing, pull-up at gait, sit to stand, and stair ascent. In contrast, FSR could estimate the gait cycle stance and swing phases and identify the pre-full standing at sit to stand. FSR showed less variation during sit to stand and stair ascent to sensitively represent the different movement states.

The interaction forces, the adsorption behavior of BSA on the membrane surface, and the structure of the BSA adsorbed layers at corresponding ionic strengths were investigated. Results indicate that when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 1 mM, there was a decrease in the PVDF-BSA and BSA-BSA electrostatic repulsion forces, resulting in a higher deposition rate of BSA onto the membrane surface, and the formation of a denser BSA layer; consequently, membrane fouling was enhanced. However, at ionic strengths of 10 and 100 mM, membrane fouling and the BSA removal rate decreased significantly. This was mainly due to the increased hydration repulsion forces, which caused a decrease in the PVDF-BSA and BSA-BSA interaction forces accompanied by a decreased hydrodynamic radius and increased diffusion coefficient of BSA. Consequently, BSA passed more easily through the membrane and into permeate. There was less accumulation of BSA on the membrane surface.

Experimental testing shows that the cantilever is able to be scanned over a 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm window and that the cantilever achieves a peak-to-peak deflection greater than 400 nm when excited at its resonance frequency of approximately 62 kHz.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-05-03", "authors": ["Anthony GFowler", "MohammadMaroufi", "S O RezaMoheimani"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4918729"}

The double compound notch type flexure stage was designed to utilize the elastic deformation of two symmetrical four-bar mechanisms to provide a millimeter-level working range. Additive manufacturing (AM) process, stereolithography, was used to fabricate the flexure stage. The AM stage was inspected by using 3D X-ray computerized tomography scanner: air-voids and shape irregularity. The compliance, open-loop resonance peak, and damping ratio of the AM stage were measured 0.317 mm/N, 80 Hz, and 0.19, respectively. The AM stage was proportional-integral-derivative positioning feedback-controlled and the capacitive type sensor was used to measure the displacement. As a result, the AM flexure mechanism was successfully 25 nm positioning controlled within 500 \u03bcm range. The resonance peak was found approximately at 280 Hz in closed-loop. This research showed that the AM flexure mechanism and the VCM can provide millimeter range with high precision and can be a good alternative to an expensive metal-based flexure mechanism and piezoelectric transducer.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-05-03", "authors": ["ChaBumLee", "Joshua ATarbutton"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4918982"}

After being exposed to 8000 ppm LPG, the output piezo-voltage of ZnSnO3/ZnO NW SPGS under compressive deformation is 0.089 V, much smaller than that in air ambience (0.533 V). The sensitivity of the SPGS against 8000 ppm LPG is up to 83.23, and the low limit of detection is 600 ppm. The SPGS has lower sensitivity against H2S, H2, ethanol, methanol and saturated water vapor than LPG, indicating good selectivity for detecting LPG. After two months, the decline of the sensing performance is less than 6%. Such piezo-LPG sensing at RT can be ascribed to the new piezo-surface coupling effect of ZnSnO3/ZnO nanocomposites.

The multiple injection model demonstrates a new sequential inkjet printing method that generates picoliter-scale multicomponent droplet-in-oil arrays via multistep printing on uniform planar substrates. Based on our previous work on double-inkjet printing, this technique adapts the piezoelectric inkjet printing technology to fabricate an oil droplet array, into which multiple precise injections of secondary droplets with different compositions and volumes can be automatically printed in the required sequence, simultaneously addressing the evaporation issues associated with printing picoliter droplets without external assistance.

The hybrid coatings can firmly adhered on hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate, and the hydrophilicity of the coating can be tuned by adjusting silane concentration. The reason for the changed hydrophilicity of the coating is disclosed by a series of characterization, and was applied to rationally design optimized hybrid coatings that transform commercial PVDF microfiltration (MF) membrane hydrophobicity into high hydrophilicity with excellent water permeability and underwater superoleophobicity for oil-in-water emulsion separation. The PVDF MF membrane decorated with optimized coatings has ultrahigh water flux (8606 L m(-2) h(-1) only under 0.9 bar, which is 34 times higher than that of pristine membrane), highly efficient oil-in-water emulsion separation ability at atmospheric pressure (filtrate flux of 140 L m(-2) h(-1)) and excellent antifouling performance. More importantly, these membranes are extremely stable as underwater superoleophobicity are maintained, even after rigorous washings or cryogenic bending, disclosing outstanding stability.

Although much is known about EVs, there is still a lack of definition as to how many naturally occurring EV subtypes there are and how their properties and functionalities might differ. This vexing issue is critical if EVs are to be fully harnessed for therapeutic applications. To address this question we have developed and describe here a sequential centrifugal ultrafiltration (SCUF) method to examine, in an unbiased manner, what EV subtypes are released in vitro into cell culture medium using the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863 as a model system. Using the culture medium from \u223c7.2\u00d710(9) LIM1863 cells, SCUF was performed using hydrophilic PVDF membranes with low protein binding properties (Millipore Durapore\u2122 Ultrafree-CL filters with 0.1, 0.22, 0.45 and 0.65 \u03bcm pore size). EV particle sizing was measured using both dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy. Comparative proteome profiling was performed by GeLC-MS/MS and qualitative protein differences between EV subtypes determined by label-free spectral counting. The results showed essentially two EV subtypes; one subtype (fraction Fn1) comprised heterogeneous EVs with particle diameters of 30-1300 nm, the other (fraction Fn5) being homogeneous EVs of 30-100 nm diameter; based on cryo-EM both EV subtypes were round shaped. Western blot analysis showed Fn5 (SCUF-Exos) contained traditional exosome marker proteins (Alix(+), TSG101(+), CD81(+), CD63(+)), while Fn1 (SCUF-sMVs) lacked these protein markers. These findings were consistent with sMVs isolated by differential centrifugation (10,000 g, DC-sMVs) and exosomes (100,000 g EVs depleted of 10,000 g material). The buoyant density of sMVs determined by OptiPrep\u2122 density gradient centrifugation was 1.18-1.19 g/mL and exosomes 1.10-1.11 g/mL. Comparative protein profiling of SCUF-Exos/-sMVs revealed 354 and 606 unambiguous protein identifications, respectively, with 256 proteins in common. A salient finding was the first report of 350 proteins uniquely identified in sMVs may of which have the potential to enable discrimination of this EV subtype from exosomes (notably, members of the septin family, kinesin-like protein (KIF23), exportin-2/chromosome segregation like-1 protein (CSE1L), and Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 (RACGAP1)). We report for the first time that both SCUF-Exos and SCUF-sMVs isolated from LIM1863 colon cancer cells induce invasion of recipient NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, the SCUF-sMVs promote invasion to a significantly greater extent (3-fold) than SCUF-Exos.

{"title": "Parallel strip waveguide for ultrasonic flow measurement in harsh environments.", "abstract": "Wetted ultrasonic transit time flow meters typically consist of one or more pairs of transducers, containing piezoelectric elements, which alternate between transmitting and detecting an ultrasonic pulse. Typical piezoelectric materials and the adhesives used to attach the piezoelectric element in such devices can be damaged by hostile environments, such as extreme temperature, potentially limiting possible applications of ultrasonic flow measurement techniques. We have investigated a design for a flow meter with an integrated thermal buffer waveguide consisting of five parallel stainless steel strips. These, in addition to thermal protection, may function as a transducer array, with the possibility of steering the emitted field. Because the buffer strips used in the transducer assembly are thin, one might expect Lamb-like guided waves to propagate along it. However, the finite width of the strips has a significant effect on the propagation characteristics of the guided waves. In this work, the effect of the waveguide's small rectangular cross-section has been studied. Additionally, we have examined the effect of thermal gradients on the average sound speed and dispersion characteristics of such strip waveguides. We also suggest modifications to the plate geometry, which can alter both the frequency content and the shape of the transmitted pulse, potentially giving a better signal to use in flow measurement.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-04-17", "authors": ["MichaelLaws", "Sivaram NRamadas", "Lawrence CLynnworth", "SteveDixon"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006933"}

Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (PMUTs), diaphragm-like thin film flexural transducers typically formed on silicon substrates, are a potential solution for integrated transducer arrays. This paper presents an overview of the current development status of PMUTs and a discussion of their suitability for miniaturized and integrated devices. The thin film piezoelectric materials required to functionalize these devices are discussed, followed by the microfabrication techniques used to create PMUT elements and the constraints the fabrication imposes on device design. Approaches for electrical interconnection and integration with on-chip electronics are discussed. Electrical and acoustic measurements from fabricated PMUT arrays with up to 320 diaphragm elements are presented. The PMUTs are shown to be broadband devices with an operating frequency which is tunable by tailoring the lateral dimensions of the flexural membrane or the thicknesses of the constituent layers.

The total magnetic resonance-visible mesh surface area of each implant was calculated and compared with the original physical mesh size to evaluate potential reduction of the functional mesh surfaces.\nWe were able to show a precise mesh demarcation, as well as accurate assessment of the surrounding tissue, in all 10 cases. We documented a significant decrease in the magnetic resonance-visualized total mesh surface area after release of the pneumoperitoneum compared with the original mesh size (mean, 190 cm(2) vs 225 cm(2); mean reduction of mesh area, 35 cm(2); P < .001). At 3 months postoperatively, a further reduction of the surface area due to significant mesh shrinkage could be observed (mean, 182 cm(2) vs 190 cm(2); mean reduction of mesh area, 8 cm(2); P < .001).\nThe new method of combining magnetic resonance imaging and meshes that provide enhanced signal capacity through direct integration of iron particles into the polyvinylidene fluoride base material allows for detailed mesh depiction and quantification of structural changes.

Sequential overprinting of the complementary components results in supramolecular network formation through complexation of \u03c0-electron rich pyrenyl or perylenyl chain-ends in one component with \u03c0-electron deficient naphthalene diimide residues in a chain-folding polyimide. The complementary \u03c0-\u03c0 stacked polymer blends generate strongly colored materials as a result of charge-transfer absorption bands in the visible spectrum, potentially negating the need for pigments or dyes in the ink formulation. Indeed, the final color of the deposited material can be tailored by varying the end-groups of the \u03c0-electron rich polymer component. Piezoelectric printing techniques were employed in a proof of concept study to allow characterization of the materials deposited, and a thermal inkjet printer adapted with imaging software enabled in situ analysis of the ink drops as they formed and of their physical properties.

In this paper, we present the design of a miniature, battery-less, self-powered sensor that can be embedded inside sport helmets and can continuously monitor and store different spatial and temporal statistics of the helmet impacts. At the core of the proposed sensor is a novel time-dilation circuit that allows measurement of a wide-range of impact energies. In this paper an array of linear piezo-floating-gate (PFG) injectors has been used for self-powered sensing and storage of linear and rotational head-impact statistics. The stored statistics are then retrieved using a plug-and-play reader and has been used for offline data analysis.

{"title": "Translation attenuation via 3' terminal codon usage in bovine csn1s2 is responsible for the difference in \u03b1s2- and \u03b2-casein profile in milk.", "abstract": "The rate of secretion of \u03b1s2-casein into bovine milk is approximately 25% of that of \u03b2-casein, yet mammary expression of their respective mRNA transcripts (csn1s2 and csn2) is not different. Our objective was to identify molecular mechanisms that explain the difference in translation efficiency between csn1s2 and csn2. Cell-free translational efficiency of csn2 was 5\u00a0times that of csn1s2. Transcripts of csn1s2 distributed into heavier polysomes than csn2 transcripts, indicating an attenuation of elongation and/or termination. Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the 5' and 3' UTRs on translational efficiency were different with luciferase and casein sequences in the coding regions. Substituting the 5' and 3' UTRs from csn2 into csn1s2 did not improve csn1s2 translation, implicating the coding region itself in the translation difference. Deletion of a 28-codon fragment from the 3' terminus of the csn1s2 coding region, which displays codons with low correlations to cell fitness, increased translation to a par with csn2. We conclude that the usage of the last 28 codons of csn1s2 is the main regulatory element that attenuates its expression and is responsible for the differential translational expression of csn1s2 and csn2.", "journal": "RNA biology", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["Julie JKim", "JaejuYu", "JnanankurBag", "MaricaBakovic", "John PCant"], "doi": "10.1080/15476286.2015.1017231\n10.1016/j.copbio.2007.01.013\n10.2174/1381612033454883\n10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00448.x\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.010\n10.1016/j.foodhyd.2006.09.006\n10.1051/rnd:2006028\n10.3168/jds.2010-4086\n10.1093/molbev/msr020\n10.1101/gad.1968910\n10.1091/mbc.E07-04-0384\n10.1093/nar/gkm1102\n10.1073/pnas.92.12.5431\n10.1126/science.1062829\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btm591\n10.1093/nar/gkg595\n10.1016/S0378-1119(97)00407-1\n10.1016/j.bbaexp.2006.04.004\n10.1016/0378-1119(94)90063-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.036\n10.1016/j.tig.2012.07.006\n10.1038/nrg2899\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002603\n10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-r12\n10.1093/nar/15.20.8125\n10.1093/nar/12.2.857\n10.1261/rna.2309906\n10.1186/gb-2002-3-3-reviews0004\n10.1038/nature10126\n10.1038/ng1967\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.031\n10.1016/j.pep.2008.01.008\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.04.006\n10.1093/nar/gkg429\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.033\n10.3168/jds.2008-1711\n10.1051/rnd:2002036\n10.1186/1297-9686-34-4-509\n10.1016/j.chroma.2007.01.100\n10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(93)77498-6\n10.1023/A:1022808918013\n10.1017/S0022029907002725\n10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79520-X\n10.1051/lait:1991431\n10.1017/S0022029996002099\n10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76546-3\n10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.11.013\n10.1093/molbev/mst128\n10.1093/nar/gks1205\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1093/nar/gkr165"}

However, the brittleness and inflexibility of pristine GF (pGF) are some of the important factors restricting their widespread application. Here, a chemical-vapor-deposition-assisted method was used to synthesize 3D GFs, which were subsequently spin-coated with polymer to produce polymer-enriched 3D GFs with high conductivity and flexibility. Compared to pGF, both poly(vinylidene fluoride)-enriched GF (PVDF/GF) and polycaprolactone-enriched GF (PCL/GF) scaffolds showed improved flexibility and handleability. Despite the presence of the polymers, the polymer-enriched 3D GF scaffolds retained high levels of electrical conductivity because of the presence of microcracks that allowed for the flow of electrons through the material. In addition, polymer enrichment of GF led to an enhancement in the formation of calcium phosphate (Ca-P) compounds when the scaffolds were exposed to simulated body fluid. Between the two polymers tested, PCL enrichment of GF resulted in a higher in vitro mineralization nucleation rate because the oxygen-containing functional group of PCL had a higher affinity for Ca-P deposition and formation compared to the polar carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond in PVDF.

The response of Cd-ZnO (1\u2009:\u200910) NWs reached up to 85.7 upon exposure to 70% relative humidity, much higher than that of undoped ZnO NWs. Cd dopant can increase the number of oxygen vacancies in the NWs, resulting in more adsorption sites on the surface of the NWs. Upon exposure to a humid environment, a large amount of water molecules can displace the adsorbed oxygen ions on the surface of Cd-ZnO NWs.

The formulation with IMC and ARG printed on transparency film resulted in a co-amorphous system. The solid state characteristics of the printed drug on porous paper substrates were not possible to determine due to strong interference from the spectra of the carrier substrate. Yet, the samples retained their yellow color after 6months of storage at room temperature and after drying at elevated temperature in a vacuum oven.

{"title": "Losses in Ferroelectric Materials.", "abstract": "Ferroelectric materials are the best dielectric and piezoelectric materials known today. Since the discovery of barium titanate in the 1940s, lead zirconate titanate ceramics in the 1950s and relaxor-PT single crystals (such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate and lead zinc niobate-lead titanate) in the 1980s and 1990s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have been the dominating piezoelectric materials for electromechanical devices, and are widely used in sensors, actuators and ultrasonic transducers. Energy losses (or energy dissipation) in ferroelectrics are one of the most critical issues for high power devices, such as therapeutic ultrasonic transducers, large displacement actuators, SONAR projectors, and high frequency medical imaging transducers. The losses of ferroelectric materials have three distinct types, i.e., elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric losses. People have been investigating the mechanisms of these losses and are trying hard to control and minimize them so as to reduce performance degradation in electromechanical devices. There are impressive progresses made in the past several decades on this topic, but some confusions still exist. Therefore, a systematic review to define related concepts and clear up confusions is urgently in need. With this objective in mind, we provide here a comprehensive review on the energy losses in ferroelectrics, including related mechanisms, characterization techniques and collections of published data on many ferroelectric materials to provide a useful resource for interested scientists and engineers to design electromechanical devices and to gain a global perspective on the complex physical phenomena involved. More importantly, based on the analysis of available information, we proposed a general theoretical model to describe the inherent relationships among elastic, dielectric, piezoelectric and mechanical losses. For multi-domain ferroelectric single crystals and ceramics, intrinsic and extrinsic energy loss mechanisms are discussed in terms of compositions, crystal structures, temperature, domain configurations, domain sizes and grain boundaries. The intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the total energy dissipation are quantified. In domain engineered ferroelectric single crystals and ceramics, polarization rotations, domain wall motions and mechanical wave scatterings at grain boundaries are believed to control the mechanical quality factors of piezoelectric resonators. We show that a thorough understanding on the kinetic processes is critical in analyzing energy loss behavior and other time-dependent properties in ferroelectric materials. At the end of the review, existing challenges in the study and control of losses in ferroelectric materials are analyzed, and future perspective in resolving these issues is discussed.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

Herein, centrosymmetric dipolar molecular crystals of the organoruthenium complex trans-[Ru(C\u2261CC6H4-4-NO2)(C\u2261CPh)(dppe)2] [dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane] display a large electric-field-induced strain behaving differently from conventional piezoelectric materials that must, structurally, be noncentrosymmetric. Further studies of related systematically varied crystalline organoruthenium complexes reveal that the strong electromechanical coupling effect is not from classical ferroelectricity, electrostriction, flexoelectricity or electrochemical strain. It is, instead, attributed to the disorder in the molecular packing, which facilitates reorientation of the molecular dipoles under the action of an applied electric field. This provides a fresh insight into the design and development of new functional materials and a promising source of electromechanical coupling in organometallic, and more generally dipolar molecular, crystals.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-03-27", "authors": ["KLau", "ABarlow", "G JMoxey", "QLi", "YLiu", "M GHumphrey", "M PCifuentes", "T JFrankcombe", "RStranger"], "doi": "10.1039/c5cp00528k"}

The composition and evolution of the SEI in Na2Ti3O7 electrodes is hereby studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To overcome typical XPS limitations in the photoelectron energy assignments, the analysis of the Auger parameter is here proposed for the first time in battery materials characterization. We have found that the electrode/electrolyte interface formed upon discharge, mostly composed by carbonates and semicarbonates (Na2CO3, NaCO3R), fluorides (NaF), chlorides (NaCl) and poly(ethylene oxide)s, is unstable upon electrochemical cycling. Additionally, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies prove the reaction of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) binder with sodium. The powerful approach used in this work, namely Auger parameter study, enables us to correctly determine the composition of the electrode surface layer without any interference from surface charging or absolute binding energy calibration effects.

The surgery was performed as per standard protocols and all patients were operated on by a single surgeon (M.J.A.). Parameters documented were demographic data, type of powered instrument used, time taken for superior osteotomy, exposure of the agger nasi, exposure of entire sac, and complications such as excess bleeding, soft tissue injury, or mucosal burns. Statistical analyses were performed using the linear mixed-effect model and 2-sample t tests.\nA total of 55 PEnDCRs were studied, 29 in the mechanical burr group and 26 in the piezoelectric or ultrasonic group. The mean time for superior osteotomy in the mechanical burr group was 3.71 minutes (range, 1.75 to 6.58 minutes); in the ultrasonic group it was 4.12 minutes (range, 1.33 to 6.25 minutes). There was no significant difference (p = 0.17) between the 2 groups. Subcategory analyses of time taken by age (p = 0.057) and sex (p = 0.56) did not show any difference between the groups. Two patients in the mechanical burr group had an insignificant superficial sac injury and 1 patient in the ultrasonic group suffered epithelial burns away from the site of osteotomy, which resolved spontaneously without any sequelae.

Inherent problems usually associated with coating polymeric electrodes onto the low surface energy PVDF were overcome by air plasma treating the film in conjunction with utilizing the VPP technique to simultaneously synthesize and in situ deposit the PEDOT electrode. Strain measurements up to the breaking-strain of PVDF (approximately 35%) indicated that the change in R/Ro was significantly smaller for the PEDOT based electrodes compared to the platinum electrode. Plasma treatment of the PVDF film increased the level of surface oxygenated carbon species that contributed to increased surface energy, as confirmed by confirmed by contact angle measurement. The enhanced adhesion between the two polymers layers contributed to a significant increase in the measured piezoelectric output voltage from 0.2 to 0.5 V for the same strain conditions. Pyroelectric voltage outputs were obtained by placing the film onto and off of a hotplate, for temperatures up to 50 \u00b0C above ambient.

The results indicated that the TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly and strongly tailored onto the membrane surface, while the PVA layer was firmly attached onto the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles and the membrane by adsorption-cross-linking. The possible mechanisms during the modification process and filtration performance, i.e., water permeability and bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection, were investigated as well. Furthermore, antifouling property was discussed through multicycles of BSA solution filtration tests, where the flux recovery ratio was significantly increased from 20.0% for pristine PVDF membrane to 80.5% for PVDF/TiO2/PVA-modified membrane. This remarkable promotion is mainly ascribed to the improvement of surface hydrophilicity, where the water contact angle of the membrane surface was decreased from 84\u00b0 for pristine membrane to 24\u00b0 for PVDF/TiO2/PVA membrane.

For that, the newly synthesized functional monomer, cytosine-bis(2,2'-bithienyl)-(4-carboxyphenyl)methane ester (Cyt-S4), revealed Watson-Crick type nucleobase pairing of 6TG. Formation of the Cyt-S4 and 6TG complex of the 2:1 stoichiometry was postulated based on the DFT calculations at the B3LYP/3-21G((\u204e)) level and experimentally confirmed by fluorescence titration. The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film was deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization on a Pt disk electrode as well as on an Au-coated glass slide and on an Au-quartz crystal resonator. The statistical model of formation of this film was successfully simulated by molecular dynamics. Completeness of the subsequent 6TG template extraction from MIP was confirmed by the UV-visible spectroscopy. An imprinting factor of 2.9 for the MIP film was determined by piezoelectric microgravimetry using ECQM.

The depolarization temperature increases with increasing ZnO concentration until depolarization disappears at 30 mol% ZnO. The semiconducting nature of ZnO provides charges to partially compensate the ferroelectric depolarization field.

The sensitivity of such a demodulation scheme depends on the spectral discrimination of the sensor and interrogator gratings. Simulations have shown that the use of in-fiber FP filters with high finesse provide better performance in terms of sensitivity compared to the demodulation using fiber Bragg gratings. Based on these results, a dynamic interrogator capable of sensing acoustic waves with amplitude of less than 1 micro-strain over frequencies of 10 kHz to several 100 kHz has been implemented. Frequency response of the fiber Bragg gratings in the given experimental setup has been compared to that of the conventional piezo sensors demonstrating that fiber Bragg gratings can be used over a relatively broad frequency range.

To this end, wave time-reversal was applied to re-focus displacement impulses in time and in space at one or several locations in a thin glass plate. This result was achieved using ultrasonic bending waves produced by a set of lamellar piezoelectric actuators bonded at the periphery of the plate. Starting from first principles, the relations linking implementation parameters to the performance of the display are developed. The mechanical design of the display, signal processing, and driving electronics are described. A set of engineering tradeoffs are made explicit and used for the design of a mock up device comprising a glass plate 148 \u00d7 210 \u00d7 0.5 mm (3). Tests indicate that a peak amplitude of 7 &#956m confined to a 20 mm (2) region could be obtained for an average power consumption of 45 mW. Simultaneous focusing at several locations was successfully achieved. We showed that a lumped-mass model for the fingertip can effectively describe the effect of an actual fingertip load at the focus point. Lastly, we elucidated a likely stimulation mechanism that involves the transient decoupling of the finger skin from the plate surface.

Mixed liquor samples were separated into liquid and solid phases by centrifugation, and viruses in the bulk solution and those associated with mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) were quantified. Enteroviruses, norovirus GII, and sapoviruses were detected in the influent throughout the sampling period (geometrical mean, 4.0, 3.1, and 4.4 log copies/mL, respectively). Enterovirus concentrations in the solid phase of mixed liquor were generally lower than those in the liquid phase, and the mean log reduction value between influent and anoxic mixed liquor was 0.40 log units. In contrast, norovirus GII and sapovirus concentrations in the solid phase were equal to or higher than those in the liquid phase, and higher log reduction values (1.3 and 1.1 log units, respectively) were observed between influent and anoxic mixed liquor. This suggested that enteroviruses were less associated with MLSS than norovirus GII and sapoviruses, resulting in lower enterovirus removal in the activated sludge process. Enteroviruses and norovirus GII were detected in the MBR effluent but sapoviruses were not in any effluent samples. When MLSS concentration was reduced to 50-60% of a normal operation level, passages of enteroviruses and norovirus GII through a PVDF microfiltration membrane were observed. Since rejection of viruses by the membrane was not related to trans-membrane pressure which was monitored as a parameter of membrane fouling, the results indicated that adsorption to MLSS plays an important role in virus removal by an MBR, and removal properties vary by viruses reflecting different adsorptive behavior to MLSS. Our observations suggested that sapoviruses are more associated with MLSS and removed more efficiently than enteroviruses and norovirus GII.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2015-03-17", "authors": ["TakayukiMiura", "SatoshiOkabe", "YoshihitoNakahara", "DaisukeSano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.046"}

A rapid analysis of drug metabolism reactions by CYPs is required because they can metabolize 95% of current drugs in drug development and effective therapies. Here, we describe a study of piezotronic-effect enhanced drug metabolism and sensing by utilizing a single ZnO nanowire (ZnO NW) device. Owing to the unique hydrophobic feature of a ZnO NW that provides a desirable \"microenvironment\" for the immobilization of biomolecules, our device can effectively stimulate the tolbutamide metabolism by decorating a ZnO NW with cytochrome P4502C9/CYPs reductase (CYP2C9/CPR) microsomes. By applying an external compressive strain to the ZnO nanowire, the piezotronic effect, which plays a primary role in tuning the transport behavior of a ZnO NW utilizing the created piezoelectric polarization charges at the local interface, can effectively enhance the performance of the device. A theoretical model is proposed using an energy band diagram to explain the experimental data.

{"title": "A comparison of 1D analytical model and 3D finite element analysis with experiments for a rosen-type piezoelectric transformer.", "abstract": "This article is dedicated to the study of Piezoelectric Transformers (PTs), which offer promising solutions to the increasing need for integrated power electronics modules within autonomous systems. The advantages offered by such transformers include: immunity to electromagnetic disturbances; ease of miniaturisation for example, using conventional micro fabrication processes; and enhanced performance in terms of voltage gain and power efficiency. Central to the adequate description of such transformers is the need for complex analytical modeling tools, especially if one is attempting to include combined contributions due to (i) mechanical phenomena owing to the different propagation modes which differ at the primary and secondary sides of the PT; and (ii) electrical phenomena such as the voltage gain and power efficiency, which depend on the electrical load. The present work demonstrates an original one-dimensional (1D) analytical model, dedicated to a Rosen-type PT and simulation results are successively compared against that of a three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element Analysis (COMSOL Multiphysics software) and experimental results. The Rosen-type PT studied here is based on a single layer soft PZT (P191) with corresponding dimensions 18 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm, which operated at the second harmonic of 176 kHz. Detailed simulational and experimental results show that the presented 1D model predicts experimental measurements to within less than 10% error of the voltage gain at the second and third resonance frequency modes. Adjustment of the analytical model parameters is found to decrease errors relative to experimental voltage gain to within 1%, whilst a 2.5% error on the output admittance magnitude at the second resonance mode were obtained. Relying on the unique assumption of one-dimensionality, the present analytical model appears as a useful tool for Rosen-type PT design and behavior understanding.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["FBoukazouha", "GPoulin-Vittrant", "L PTran-Huu-Hue", "MBavencoffe", "FBoubenider", "MRguiti", "MLethiecq"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2015.02.008"}

Bioelectric signals have been widely studied for the estimation of the contraction force for physical human-robot interactions, but the correlation between the biosignal and actual motion is decreased under fatigue conditions. Muscle stiffness could be a useful contraction force estimator under fatigue conditions because it measures the same physical quantity as the muscle contraction that generates the force. Electromyography (EMG), mechanomyography (MMG), and a piezoelectric resonance-based active muscle stiffness sensor were used to analyze the biceps brachii under isometric muscle fatigue conditions with reference force sensors at the end of the joint. Compared to EMG and MMG, the change in the stiffness signal was smaller (p < 0.05) in the invariable contraction force generation test until failure. In addition, in the various contraction level force generation tests, the stiffness signal under the fatigue condition changed <10% (p < 0.05) compared with the signal under non-fatigue conditions. This result indicates that the muscle stiffness signal is less sensitive to muscle fatigue than other biosignals.

{"title": "Vascular smooth muscle cell stiffness and adhesion to collagen I modified by vasoactive agonists.", "abstract": "In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins play important roles in sustaining vascular tone and resistance. The main goal of this study was to determine whether VSMCs adhesion to type I collagen (COL-I) was altered in parallel with the changes in the VSMCs contractile state induced by vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. VSMCs were isolated from rat cremaster skeletal muscle arterioles and maintained in primary culture without passage. Cell adhesion and cell E-modulus were assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) by repetitive nano-indentation of the AFM probe on the cell surface at 0.1 Hz sampling frequency and 3200 nm Z-piezo travelling distance (approach and retraction). AFM probes were tipped with a 5 \u03bcm diameter microbead functionalized with COL-I (1 mg\\ml). Results showed that the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (ANG-II; 10-6) significantly increased (p<0.05) VSMC E-modulus and adhesion probability to COL-I by approximately 35% and 33%, respectively. In contrast, the vasodilator adenosine (ADO; 10-4) significantly decreased (p<0.05) VSMC E-modulus and adhesion probability by approximately -33% and -17%, respectively. Similarly, the NO donor (PANOate, 10-6 M), a potent vasodilator, also significantly decreased (p<0.05) the VSMC E-modulus and COL-I adhesion probability by -38% and -35%, respectively. These observations support the hypothesis that integrin-mediated VSMC adhesion to the ECM protein COL-I is dynamically regulated in parallel with VSMC contractile activation.

The one bird for which we were able to maintain the accelerometer recordings over a long period of time recovered slowly over more than a month after cDAF was discontinued.

Furthermore, an in vitro agar plating study was performed on the unmodified, vehicle-modified, and voriconazole-modified microneedles. Unlike the unmodified and vehicle-modified microneedles, the voriconazole-modified microneedles showed antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The unmodified, vehicle-modified, and voriconazole-modified microneedles did not show activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus. The results indicate that piezoelectric inkjet printing may be useful for loading transdermal drug delivery devices such as polyglycolic acid microneedles with antifungal pharmacologic agents and other pharmacologic agents with poor solubility in aqueous solutions.", "journal": "Biointerphases", "date": "2015-03-04", "authors": ["Ryan DBoehm", "JustinDaniels", "ShaneStafslien", "AdnanNasir", "JoeLefebvre", "Roger JNarayan"], "doi": "10.1116/1.4913378"}
{"title": "Electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polypyrrole film for sensing of clofibric acid.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric quartz crystals and analogous gold substrates were electrochemically coated with molecularly imprinted polypyrrole films for pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) of clofibric acid, a metabolite of clofibrate. Cyclic voltammetry data obtained during polymerization and deposited weight estimations revealed a decrease of the polymerization rate with increasing clofibric acid concentration. XPS measurements indicated that clofibric acid could be removed after imprinting with an aqueous ethanol solution, which was further optimized by using PAD. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements revealed differences between molecularly imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted polymer (NIP) layers. Binding experiments with clofibric acid and other substances showed a pronounced selectivity of the MIP for clofibric acid vs. carbamazepine, but the response of MIP and NIP to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was higher than that for clofibric acid. A smooth surface, revealed by AFM measurements, with roughness of 6-8 nm for imprinted and non-imprinted layers, might be a reason for an excessively low density of specific binding sites for clofibric acid. Furthermore, the decreased polymerization rate in the presence of clofibric acid might not result in well-defined polymer structures, which could be the reason for the lower sensitivity.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-03-03", "authors": ["BiancaSchweiger", "JungtaeKim", "Young JunKim", "MathiasUlbricht"], "doi": "10.3390/s150304870\n10.1016/S0040-4039(01)87213-0\n10.1038/361645a0\n10.1016/0957-4166(94)80096-0\n10.1021/jo000014n\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.11.005\n10.1021/cr990099w\n10.1016/j.aca.2009.07.029\n10.1039/c39790000854\n10.1021/cr900226k\n10.1016/j.talanta.2004.10.009\n10.1016/j.bios.2008.11.025\n10.1016/j.bios.2010.03.023\n10.1021/ac000156h\n10.1149/1.1946367\n10.1016/j.electacta.2007.10.032\n10.1016/S0003-2670(96)00361-3\n10.3390/s110908654\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.08.020\n10.3390/s130505493\n10.1039/C4AY01320D\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.07.056\n10.1002/elan.201400251\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.045\n10.1021/am100805y\n10.1021/ac00121a044\n10.1021/ac00169a030\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.05.014\n10.1016/S0043-1354(98)00099-2\n10.1007/s11270-014-2064-0\n10.1007/s11356-014-3599-8\n10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.090\n10.1371/journal.pone.0078167\n10.1007/s11356-013-1565-5\n10.1016/j.aca.2008.07.051\n10.1007/s00216-003-2433-9\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.12.065\n10.1039/a807124a\n10.1021/es0484146\n10.1007/s11270-005-3539-9\n10.1016/j.electacta.2012.11.115\n10.1039/b311098b\n10.1021/j100203a059\n10.1021/la803874r\n10.1016/j.snb.2007.04.034\n10.1016/0379-6779(94)90289-5\n10.1021/cm00023a012\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9918(199710)25:11<837::AID-SIA307>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1016/0022-3697(84)90150-1\n10.1103/PhysRevB.30.4846\n10.1021/ma2010525\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.053\n10.1021/la034893v\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.040"}

PCa proteins were resolved by 2-DE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which were subsequently incubated with either pooled serum from PCa patients or from normal controls. Mass spectrometry results have identified 18 antigens from 21 different 2-DE spots associated with PCa. Autoantibody response to antigens PRDX2, PRDX6 and ANXA11 in PCa patient's sera was confirmed using recombinant antigens. Further validation with an independent set of PCa patient's sera have shown relatively increased abundance of PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies in PCa patients. Formal concept analysis method was applied to assess whether the abundance of these autoantibodies could influence the classification of patients. However, sensitivity of the single antibody to discriminate prostate tumor and healthy controls varies from 70% to 80%, whereas combination of both PRDX6 and ANXA11 antibodies increased sensitivity to 90% for tumors and 100% for healthy controls.

The optimal suture material is still under discussion. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is described to have superior properties of biocompatibility and is therefore frequently used as a mesh component. Only little information is available about its use as a suture material. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of PVDF as a suture material in comparison to 5 different established sutures in a rat model.\nIn 30 male rats, a monofilamental PVDF suture (Resopren\u00ae) and 5 established control suture materials [polyester (Miralene\u00ae), polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore\u00ae), poliglecaprone (Monocryl\u00ae), polydioxanone (Monoplus\u00ae), polyglactin 910 (Vicryl\u00ae), USP size 3-0] were placed in the subcutaneous layer of the abdominal wall without knot or tension. After 3, 7 or 21 days, the abdominal walls were explanted for histopathological and immunohistochemical investigation with special regard to the size and quality of foreign body granuloma and the length of the comet tail-like infiltrate (CTI).\nThe PVDF sutures showed the smallest size of foreign body granuloma (60 \u00b1 14 \u00b5m) and the smallest CTI length (343 \u00b1 60 \u00b5m) of all polymers after 21 days. Only PVDF (Resopren) and polydioxanone (Monoplus) showed a significant collagen I/III ratio increase between days 3 and 21 (p = 0.009 and p = 0.016). The quality of foreign body reaction regarding inflammation, proliferation and fibrotic remodeling was similar between all suture materials.\nOur data indicate that monofilamental PVDF sutures show a favorable foreign body reaction with small granuloma sizes and CTI length in comparison to established sutures.

{"title": "Atomic-scale origin of piezoelectricity in wurtzite ZnO.", "abstract": "ZnO has been extensively studied by virtue of its remarkably high piezoelectric responses, especially in nanowire forms. Currently, the high piezoelectricity of wurtzite ZnO is understood in terms of the covalent-bonding interaction between Zn 3d and O 2p orbitals. However, the Zn 3d orbitals are not capable of forming hybridized orbitals with the O 2pz orbitals since the Zn ion is characterized by fully filled non-interacting 3d orbitals. To resolve this puzzling problem, we have investigated the atomic-scale origin of piezoelectricity by exploiting density-functional theory calculations. On the basis of the computed orbital-resolved density of states and the band structure over the \u0393-M first Brillouin zone, we propose an intriguing bonding mechanism that accounts for the observed high piezoelectricity - intra-atomic 3dz(2)-4pz orbital self-mixing of Zn, followed by asymmetric hybridization between the Zn 3dz(2)-4pz self-mixed orbital and the O 2pz orbital along the polar c-axis of the wurtzite ZnO.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-02-27", "authors": ["Jung-HoonLee", "Woo-JinLee", "Sung-HoonLee", "Seong MinKim", "SungjinKim", "Hyun MyungJang"], "doi": "10.1039/c4cp06094f"}

By virtue of probing the pyroelectric activity over the film thickness in the presence of a variable, external electrical field, the local ferroelectric response and spatially resolved hysteresis could be obtained. A large asymmetry was found between the positive and negative electrode-polymer interface. Differences in amplitude of polarization, contribution of interface charges and length scale of the polarization-free zone near the electrodes suggest a higher availability of compensation charges at the negative electrode that finally stabilize the local polarization. The resulting asymmetries in the polarization distribution are hence attributed to excess charges as a result of electron injection as a specific charge generation mechanism at the negative electrode.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2015-02-26", "authors": ["TPutzeys", "MW\u00fcbbenhorst"], "doi": "10.1039/c4cp06033d"}
{"title": "Two-dimensional spatial manipulation of microparticles in continuous flows in acoustofluidic systems.", "abstract": "We report a modeling and experimental study of techniques to acoustically focus particles flowing through a microfluidic channel. Our theoretical model differs from prior works in that we solve an approximate 2-D wave transmission model that accounts for wave propagation in both the solid and fluid phases. Our simulations indicate that particles can be effectively focused at driving frequencies as high as 10% off of the resonant condition. This conclusion is supported by experiments on the acoustic focusing of particles in nearly square microchannels, which are studied for different flow rates, driving frequencies and placements of the lead zirconate titanate transducer, either underneath the microchannel or underneath a parallel trough. The relative acoustic potential energy and the resultant velocity fields for particles with positive acoustic contrast coefficients are estimated in the 2-D limit. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the spatial distribution of the flowing microparticles in three dimensions.

We also show that it is possible to control the extent of focusing of the microparticles, and that it is possible to decouple the focusing of microparticles in the vertical direction from the lateral direction in rectangular channels with anisotropic cross sections.

The transcriptome of triceps brachii muscles from male C57/BL6 mice corresponding to two genotypes (wild-type and myostatin-reduced) under two conditions (high and low physical activity) was characterized using RNA-Seq. Synergistic and antagonistic interaction and ortholog modes of action of myostatin genotype and activity level on genes and gene pathways in this skeletal muscle were uncovered; 1,836, 238, and 399 genes exhibited significant (FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.005) activity-by-genotype interaction, genotype and activity effects, respectively. The most common differentially expressed profiles were (i) inactive myostatin-reduced relative to active and inactive wild-type, (ii) inactive myostatin-reduced and active wild-type, and (iii) inactive myostatin-reduced and inactive wild-type. Several remarkable genes and gene pathways were identified. The expression profile of nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit (Naca) supports a synergistic interaction between activity level and myostatin genotype, while Gremlin 2 (Grem2) displayed an antagonistic interaction. Comparison between activity levels revealed expression changes in genes encoding for structural proteins important for muscle function (including troponin, tropomyosin and myoglobin) and for fatty acid metabolism (some linked to diabetes and obesity, DNA-repair, stem cell renewal, and various forms of cancer). Conversely, comparison between genotype groups revealed changes in genes associated with G1-to-S-phase transition of the cell cycle of myoblasts and the expression of Grem2 proteins that modulate the cleavage of the myostatin propeptide. A number of myostatin-feedback regulated gene products that are primarily regulatory were uncovered, including microRNA impacting central functions and Piezo proteins that make cationic current-controlling mechanosensitive ion channels.

This work presents two methodologies to eject droplets from a liquid water surface and analyze them via mass spectrometry. In bursting bubble ionization (BBI), droplet ejection is achieved via the formation of a jet following bubble rupture at the surface of a liquid to yield 250 \u03bcm diameter droplets (10 nL volume). In interfacial sampling by an acoustic transducer (ISAT), droplets are produced by focusing pulsed piezoelectric transducer-generated acoustic waves at the surface of a liquid, resulting in the ejection of droplets of 100 \u03bcm in diameter (500 pL volume). In both experimental methodologies, ejected droplets are aspirated into the inlet of the mass spectrometer, resulting in the facile formation of gas-phase ions. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to readily generate spectra of surface-active analytes, and we compare the spectra to those obtained by electrospray ionization. Charge measurements indicate that the ejected droplets are near-neutral (<0.1% of the Rayleigh limit), suggesting that gas-phase ion generation occurs in the heated transfer capillary of the instrument in a mechanism similar to thermospray or sonic spray ionization.

{"title": "Influence of the carrier concentration on the piezotronic effect in a ZnO/Au Schottky junction.", "abstract": "The piezotronic effect, which utilizes the piezopotential to engineer the interface characteristics, has been widely exploited to design novel functional device or to optimize the device performance, which is intimately related to the carrier concentration. Here, by constructing a general Schottky diode, the piezotronic effect dependence on the carrier concentration was investigated systematically using ultraviolet (UV) illumination. Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy was employed to quantify the carrier concentration in ZnO nanorods under UV illumination. The results showed that the carrier concentration increases with increasing light intensity and an average value of up to 5.6 \u00d7 10(18) cm(-3) under 1.2 mW cm(-2) light illumination was obtained. Furthermore, with increasing UV light intensity, an increasingly imperceptible variation in the current-voltage characteristics under strain was observed, which finally disappeared under 1.2 mW cm(-2) light illumination. This phenomenon was attributed to the weakened modulation ability of the piezopotential due to the strengthened screening effect. In addition, the gradual disappearing in the barrier also contributed to the gradual disappearance of the piezotronic effect. This study provides an in-depth understanding of piezotronics, which could be extended to other piezoelectric devices and guide the design and optimization of piezotronic and even piezophototronic devices.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2015-02-17", "authors": ["ShengnanLu", "JunjieQi", "YousongGu", "ShuoLiu", "QiankunXu", "ZengzeWang", "QijieLiang", "YueZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c4nr07619b"}

Parallel extraction of several samples was performed for 15 to 60 min, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection of the individual acceptor solutions. Important PALME parameters including the chemical composition of the liquid membrane, extraction time, and sample pH were optimized, and the extraction performance was evaluated.

It consists in that the velocity of aforementioned waves first increases, achieves its maximum, and only then decreases with increasing conductance of a layer placed at the surface of piezoelectric half-space. In this paper we continue to study the peculiarities of the effect appearance and the influence of different electrical boundary conditions on its characteristics. Conditions have been found under which the said effect appears and, respectively, disappears. The magnitude of positive change in velocity with increasing layer conductance is demonstrated to be reduced up to zero as a layer with arbitrary conductance has been moved away from the piezoelectric surface. The positive change in velocity increases when an perfectly conductive screen moves away from the \"piezoelectric half-space - conductive layer\" structure.

We found that activation of TRPV1 channels with capsaicin either in dorsal root ganglion neurons or in a heterologous expression system inhibited the mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels by depleting phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and its precursor phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] from the plasma membrane through Ca(2+)-induced phospholipase C\u03b4 (PLC\u03b4) activation. Experiments with chemically inducible phosphoinositide phosphatases and receptor-induced activation of PLC\u03b2 indicated that inhibition of Piezo channels required depletion of both PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2. The mechanically activated current amplitudes decreased substantially in the excised inside-out configuration, where the membrane patch containing Piezo1 channels is removed from the cell. PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P applied to these excised patches inhibited this decrease. Thus, we concluded that Piezo channel activity requires the presence of phosphoinositides, and the combined depletion of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P reduces channel activity.

Then, the surface-deposited multilayers were constructed via electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly of the functionalized oCNTs. The scanning electron microscope and atom force microscope images confirmed that the coated multilayers exhibited nanofibrous and porous structure. The live/dead cell staining and cell viability assay results indicated that the coated nanofibrous multilayers had excellent compatibility with endothelial cells. The cell morphology observation further confirmed the promotion ability of surface endothelialization due to the coated heparin/heparin-mimicking multilayers. Further systematical evaluation on blood compatibility revealed that the surface heparin/heparin-mimicking multilayer-coated membranes also had significantly improved blood compatibility including restrained platelet adhesion and activation, prolonged blood clotting times, and inhibited activation of coagulation and complement factors. In summary, the proposed nanofibrous multilayers integrated endothelialization and antithrombogenic properties; meanwhile, the heparin-mimicking coating validated comparable performances as heparin coating.

For the FeMoO4 compound, for both the \u03b1 and the \u03b2 allotropic forms, the structural features have been correlated to the magnetic properties, the M\u00f6ssbauer signals, and the optical absorption properties to gain a better understanding of the phenomena at the origin of the piezo(thermo)chromic behavior.

Furthermore, the low Fe(3+) concentration (9 and 4 mol\u202f%, respectively, in the \u03b1 and the \u03b2 allotropic forms) was also quantified based on the magnetic susceptibility measurements. The net increase in the Fe(3+) quantity in the \u03b1-form in comparison to the \u03b2-form, which is associated with the occurrence of Fe-Mo charge transfer, is at the origin of the important divergence of coloration of the two forms. To design new piezo(thermo)chromic oxides and to control the pressure (temperature) of this first-order phase transition, FeMoO4-MgMoO4 solid solutions were synthesized.

A combination of negative pressure and increased doses of lithium synergistically increased Wnt signaling and demonstrated further enhanced cell migration into simulated wound sites, with maximal filling of the simulated wound observed at lithium concentrations of at least 10mM.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-02-07", "authors": ["VaibhavPandit", "Sterling RobertNesbitt", "Diana YKim", "AmandaMixon", "Shiva PKotha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.01.012"}

{"title": "Absence of systemic toxicity in mouse model towards BaTiO3 nanoparticulate based eluate treatment.", "abstract": "One of the existing issues in implant failure of orthopedic biomaterials is the toxicity induced by the fine particles released during long term use in vivo, leading to acute inflammatory response. In developing a new class of piezobiocomposite to mimic the integrated electrical and mechanical properties of bone, bone-mimicking physical properties as well as in vitro cytocompatibility properties have been achieved with spark plasma sintered hydroxyapatite (HA)-barium titanate (BaTiO3) composites. However, the presence of BaTiO3 remains a concern towards the potential toxicity effect. To address this issue, present work reports the first result to conclusively confirm the non-toxic effect of HA-BaTiO3 piezobiocomposite nanoparticulates, in vivo. Twenty BALB/c mice were intra-articularly injected at their right knee joints with different concentrations of HA-BaTiO3 composite of up to 25\u00a0mg/ml. The histopathological examination confirmed the absence of any trace of injected particles or any sign of inflammatory reaction in the vital organs, such as heart, spleen, kidney and liver at 7\u00a0days post-exposure period. Rather, the injected nanoparticulates were found to be agglomerated in the vicinity of the knee joint, surrounded by macrophages. Importantly, the absence of any systemic toxicity response in any of the vital organs in the treated mouse model, other than a mild local response at the site of delivery, was recorded. The serum biochemical analyses using proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) also complimented to the non-immunogenic response to injected particulates. Altogether, the absence of any inflammatory/adverse reaction will open up myriad of opportunities for BaTiO3 based piezoelectric implantable devices in biomedical applications.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

The results presented here demonstrate that nonannealed films exhibit much larger \u03b5 distributions, both in terms of magnitude and distribution, when compared to annealed films. The polymorphic phase of PVDF before and after annealing is also confirmed using X-ray diffraction. Nonannealed films are found to be in the \u03b3-phase with annealing promoting the transition to primarily \u03b2-phase. Combining these results, we conclude that the decrease in \u03b5 with annealing time is due to the phase transformation from \u03b3- to \u03b2-phase.

The seed layer's orientation efficiency improved with increasing the RF power from 70 to 300 W and resulted in narrowing the Al (111) rocking curves. AFM and XRD data have shown that crystal orientations of both the electrode and reactively sputtered AlN film are considerably improved when the substrate micro roughness is reduced from an ordinary level of a few nanometers to atomic level corresponding to root mean square roughness as low as about 0.2 to 0.3 nm. The most perfectly crystallized film stacks of 100-nm Al and 500-nm AlN were obtained in this work using etching in Ar plasma optimized to create an atomically smooth, epi-ready Si surface morphology that enables superior AlN seed layer nucleation conditions.

From a traditional materials design perspective, this task often requires precise control over the atomic composition and structure. However, owing to their mechanical properties, low-dimensional layered materials can actually withstand a significant amount of strain and thus sustain elastic deformations before fracture. This, in return, presents a unique technique for tuning their physical properties by \"strain engineering\". Here, we find that local strain induced on ReSe2, a new member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family, greatly changes its magnetic, optical, and electrical properties. Local strain induced by generation of wrinkle (1) modulates the optical gap as evidenced by red-shifted photoluminescence peak, (2) enhances light emission, (3) induces magnetism, and (4) modulates the electrical properties.

During discharge, large layered spherical agglomerates of LiOH were characteristically formed on the MnO2 cathodes while smaller, toroidal, spherical Li2O2 particles and films were formed on the Super P cathodes. In an anhydrous DMSO based electrolyte the LiOH structures were also found on cathodes discharged in the anhydrous electrolyte, suggesting that MnO2 initiates electrochemical decomposition of the DMSO electrolyte to form LiOH via H2O reactions with Li2O2. The LiOH crystals are uniquely formed on MnO2, and segregated to this phase even in mixed oxide-carbon cathodes. In contrast, no Li2O2 toroids were noted on Super P cathodes discharged in the DMSO based electrolytes. Instead, the morphology varied from smaller sheets (at high discharge current) to much larger agglomerates (at low discharge currents). In mixed carbon-MnO2 nanorod cathodes, the use of PVDF initiates H2O formation that affects discharge products and an overall mechanism governing phase formation at MnO2 in sulfolane and anhydrous DMSO with and without PVDF binder is presented.

Subsequently, the MWCNT@AC nanohybrids were used as fillers to enhance the dielectric properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based composites. It is found that the dielectric constant of the MWCNT@AC/PVDF composites can reach 5910 (the dielectric loss is \u223c2), which is considerably better than that of MWCNT/PVDF composites. The uniform amorphous carbon shell provides an insulative layer between adjacent MWCNTs in the polymer matrix, which not only prevents the direct contact of MWCNTs but also improves the dispersibility of the MWCNTs. Therefore, a surprising number of microcapacitors could be formed in the composites before the formation of a conductive network, leading to a gigantic enhancement in the dielectric properties.

These mice have five distinct human mutations in two genes, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin1 (PS1) engineered into two transgenes driven by a neuron-specific promoter (Thy1), and thus develop severe amyloid deposition by 4 months of age. Age-matched (4-6.5 months old) male and female 5XFAD mice were monitored and compared to wild-type littermate controls for multiple sleep traits using a non-invasive, high throughput, automated piezoelectric system which detects breathing and gross body movements to characterize sleep and wake. Sleep-wake patterns were recorded continuously under baseline conditions (undisturbed) for 3 days and after sleep deprivation of 4h, which in mice produces a significant sleep debt and challenge to sleep homeostasis. Under baseline conditions, 5XFAD mice exhibited shorter bout lengths (14% lower values for males and 26% for females) as compared to controls (p<0.001). In females, the 5XFAD mice also showed 12% less total sleep than WT (p<0.01).

Correlations of PWV measured by the 3 methods were poor (r = 0.39, r = 0.39, and r = 0.31 for PWV-A vs. PWV-C, PWV-A vs. PWV-E, and PWV-C vs. PWV-E, respectively, all p < 0.05). By Bland-Altman analysis, mean difference (\u00b1SD) of PWV-A vs. PWV-C was -1.9 \u00b1 2.0 m/s, of PWV-A vs. PWV-E -3.6 \u00b1 1.9 m/s, and of PWV-C vs. PWV-E -2.7 \u00b1 1.9 m/s, with a wide coefficient of variation (22.3, 25.7, and 25.7 %, respectively). As expected, PWV-A, PWV-C, and PWV-E correlated with other arterial stiffness parameters, such as intima-media thickness (r = 0.22, r = 0.22, and r = 0.36, respectively), E p (r = 0.37, r = 0.26, and r = 0.94, respectively), and augmentation index measured by Arteriograph method (r = 0.66, r = 0.35, and r = 0.26, respectively); all p < 0.05. Assessment of PWV is markedly dependent on the technique used to measure it, related to various methods for measuring traveled distance of the arterial wave. Our results suggest the urgent need to establish reference values of PWV for each of these techniques, separately, to be used in routine clinical practice.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2015-01-31", "authors": ["Diana JMihalcea", "MariaFlorescu", "Berenice M CSuran", "Oana AEnescu", "Raluca IMincu", "StefaniaMagda", "NataliaPatrascu", "DragosVinereanu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-015-0632-x"}
{"title": "Elastic mesh with thermoplastic polyurethane filaments preserves effective porosity of textile implants.", "abstract": "In hernia surgery, meshes with small pores tend to be filled by fibrous tissue, which reduces their stretchability and causes patient complaints. Because of the inelasticity of current meshes, mechanical strain might cause pores to collapse even in large-pore mesh constructions. In this study, a mesh with elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments was constructed to prevent pore size changes even under mechanical strain, and its biocompatibility in comparison with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was evaluated. A mesh was constructed using PVDF with elastic TPU filaments and mechanically tested. After midline laparotomy in 20 rabbits, we placed a 15 cm \u00d7 3 cm mesh as inlay in the defect. Animals were randomized to either the TPU or PVDF group. After 7 or 21 days, mesh expansion was measured under pneumoperitoneum, and abdominal walls were explanted for immunohistochemical investigations. In vitro, TPU meshes showed a slight reduction in effective porosity from 46% at tension-free conditions to 26% under longitudinal and to 34% under transverse strain. The nonelastic PVDF meshes showed a marked reduction in effective porosity from 70% to 7% and 52%, respectively. The TPU mesh had a breaking elongation of 101% and a tensile strength of 35 N/cm. In vivo, both meshes achieved healing of the incision without hernial defect. The TPU mesh maintained its elasticity under pneumoperitoneum. The amount of CD68-positive, Ki67-positive, and apoptotic cells was significantly lower in the TPU group after 7 and 21 days. The newly developed TPU mesh shows elasticity, structural stability, and preserved effective porosity under mechanical strain. Immunohistochemistry indicates superior biocompatibility of TPU mesh compared with PVDF after 7 and 21 days.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The technique was employed on soft PZT exhibiting a large longitudinal piezoelectric response (d(33) \u223c 650 pC N(-1)). It was found that electric poling brings about a considerable degree of irreversible tetragonal to monoclinic transformation.

{"title": "Shear Wave Wavefront Mapping Using Ultrasound Color Flow Imaging.", "abstract": "A wavefront reconstruction method for a continuous shear wave is proposed. The method uses ultrasound color flow imaging (CFI) to detect the shear wave's wavefront. When the shear wave vibration frequency satisfies the required frequency condition and the displacement amplitude satisfies the displacement amplitude condition, zero and maximum flow velocities appear at the shear wave vibration phases of zero and \u03c0 rad, respectively. These specific flow velocities produce the shear wave's wavefront map in CFI. An important feature of this method is that the shear wave propagation is observed in real time without addition of extra functions to the ultrasound imaging system. The experiments are performed using a 6.5 MHz CFI system. The shear wave is excited by a multilayer piezoelectric actuator. In a phantom experiment, the shear wave velocities estimated using the proposed method and those estimated using a system based on displacement measurement show good agreement.", "journal": "Ultrasonic imaging", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["YoshikiYamakoshi", "ToshihiroKasahara", "TomohiroIijima", "YasushiYuminaka"], "doi": "10.1177/0161734614568532"}
{"title": "Revealing the flexoelectricity in the mixed-phase regions of epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films.", "abstract": "Understanding the elastic response on the nanoscale phase boundaries of multiferroics is an essential issue in order to explain their exotic behaviour. Mixed-phase BiFeO3 films, epitaxially grown on LaAlO3 (001) substrates, have been investigated by means of scanning probe microscopy to characterize the elastic and piezoelectric responses in the mixed-phase region of rhombohedral-like monoclinic (MI) and tilted tetragonal-like monoclinic (MII,tilt) phases. Ultrasonic force microscopy reveal that the regions with low/high stiffness values topologically coincide with the MI/MII,tilt phases. X-ray diffraction strain analysis confirms that the MI phase is more compliant than the MII,tilt one. Significantly, the correlation between elastic modulation and piezoresponse across the mixed-phase regions manifests that the flexoelectric effect results in the enhancement of the piezoresponse at the phase boundaries and in the MI regions.

Four 2A peptides derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (F2A), equine rhinitis A virus (E2A), porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) and Thosea asigna virus (T2A), respectively, were compared for expression of 3 biosimilar IgG1 mAbs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. HC and LC were linked by different 2A peptides both in the absence and presence of GSG linkers. Insertion of a furin recognition site upstream of 2A allowed removal of 2A residues that would otherwise be attached to the HC. Different 2A peptides exhibited different cleavage efficiencies that correlated to the mAb expression level. The relative cleavage efficiency of each 2A peptide remains similar for expression of different IgG1 mAbs in different CHO cells. While complete cleavage was not observed for any of the 2A peptides, GSG linkers did enhance the cleavage efficiency and thus the mAb expression level. T2A with the GSG linker (GT2A) exhibited the highest cleavage efficiency and mAb expression level. Stably amplified CHO DG44 pools generated using GT2A had titers 357, 416 and 600\u00a0mg/L for the 3 mAbs in shake flask batch cultures.

It focuses on the phenomenon in which the sound power transmitted through a finite-sized panel drops significantly at some frequencies just below the resonance frequencies of the panel in the low-frequency range as a result of modal coupling cancellation. In a previous study, it was shown that when point-force actuators are located on nodal lines for the frequency at which this phenomenon occurs, a force equivalent to the incident sound wave can act on the panel. In this study, a practical method for sensing volume velocity using a small number of piezoelectric film strips is investigated. It is found that two quadratically shaped piezoelectric film strips, attached at the same nodal lines as those where the actuators were placed, can sense the volume velocity approximately in the low-frequency range. Results of simulations show that combining the proposed actuation method and the sensing method can achieve a practical control effect at low frequencies over a wide frequency range.

A group of nanocomposite membranes made of polystyrenesulfonic acid-grafted silica particles embedded in a Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride-co-HexaFluoroPropene) (PVdF-HFP) matrix was studied by combining neutron and X-ray scatterings on the nanometer to angstrom scale. This approach allows for the variation in the morphology and structure as a function of particle loading to be described. These studies showed that the particles aggregate with increasing particle loading and these aggregates swell, creating a physical interaction with the polymer matrix. Particle loadings lower than 30 wt% induce a slight strain between both of the subphases, namely the polymer matrix and the particles. This strain is decreased with particle loading between 20 and 30 wt% conjointly with the beginning of proton conduction.

Anifrolumab has been developed to treat autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials. To decipher the molecular basis of its mechanism of action, we engaged in multiple epitope mapping approaches to determine how it interacts with IFNAR1 and antagonizes the receptor. We identified the epitope of anifrolumab using enzymatic fragmentation, phage-peptide library panning and mutagenesis approaches. Our studies revealed that anifrolumab recognizes the SD3 subdomain of IFNAR1 with the critical residue R(279). Further, we solved the crystal structure of anifrolumab Fab to a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5. Guided by our epitope mapping studies, we then used in silico protein docking of the anifrolumab Fab crystal structure to IFNAR1 and characterized the corresponding mode of binding. We find that anifrolumab sterically inhibits the binding of IFN ligands to IFNAR1, thus blocking the formation of the ternary IFN/IFNAR1/IFNAR2 signaling complex.

{"title": "Biosensor technology for pesticides--a review.", "abstract": "Pesticides, due to their lucrative outcomes, are majorly implicated in agricultural fields for crop production enhancement. Due to their pest removal properties, pesticides of various classes have been designed to persist in the environment over a longer duration after their application to achieve maximum effectiveness. Apart from their recalcitrant structure and agricultural benefits, pesticides also impose acute toxicological effects onto the other various life forms. Their accumulation in the living system may prove to be detrimental if established in higher concentrations. Thus, their prompt and accurate analysis is a crucial matter of concern. Conventional techniques like chromatographic techniques (HPLC, GC, etc.) used for pesticides detection are associated with various limitations like stumpy sensitivity and efficiency, time consumption, laboriousity, requirement of expensive equipments and highly trained technicians, and many more. So there is a need to recruit the methods which can detect these neurotoxic compounds sensitively, selectively, rapidly, and easily in the field. Present work is a brief review of the pesticide effects, their current usage scenario, permissible limits in various food stuffs and 21st century advancements of biosensor technology for pesticide detection. Due to their exceptional performance capabilities, easiness in operation and on-site working, numerous biosensors have been developed for bio-monitoring of various environmental samples for pesticide evaluation immensely throughout the globe. Till date, based on sensing element (enzyme based, antibody based, etc.) and type of detection method used (Electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric, etc.), a number of biosensors have been developed for pesticide detection. In present communication, authors have summarized 21st century's approaches of biosensor technology for pesticide detection such as enzyme-based biosensors, immunosensors, aptamers, molecularly imprinted polymers, and biochips technology.

The aim of this study was to investigate PTP1B amplification in gastric cancer and its association with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients, and further determine the role of PTP1B in gastric tumorigenesis. Our data demonstrated that PTP1B was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched normal gastric tissues by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. In addition, copy number analysis showed that PTP1B was amplified in 68/131 (51.9%) gastric cancer cases, whereas no amplification was found in the control subjects. Notably, PTP1B amplification was positively associated with its protein expression, and was significantly related to poor survival of gastric cancer patients. Knocking down PTP1B expression in gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and induced cell cycle arrested and apoptosis. Mechanically, PTP1B promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness through modulating Src-related signaling pathways, such as Src/Ras/MAPK and Src/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways.

Here we report a true ferroelectric field effect-carrier density modulation in an underlying Ge(001) substrate by switching of the ferroelectric polarization in epitaxial c-axis-oriented BaTiO3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Using the density functional theory, we demonstrate that switching of BaTiO3 polarization results in a large electric potential change in Ge.

The SCS resonators are fabricated by a CMOS foundry using an SOI-MEMS technology together with a polysilicon refill process. A high electromechanical coupling coefficient is attained by the use of 50-nm transducer gap spacing. Moreover, a vacuum package of the fabricated resonators is carried out through wafer-level bonding process. In this work, the corner supporting beams of the resonator serve not only mechanical supports but also piezoresistors for detecting the motional signal, hence substantially simplifying the overall resonator design to realize the piezo-R sensing. In addition, the fabricated resonators are capable of either capacitive sensing or piezo-R detection under the same capacitive drive. To mitigate feedthrough signals from parasitics, a differential measurement configuration of the piezo-R transduction is implemented in this work, featuring more than 30-dB improvement on the feedthrough level as compared with the single-ended piezo-R counterpart and purely capacitive sensing readout.

The proposed technique is based on using the resonator output current to generate displacement or acceleration signals by integration or differentiation operations, respectively. The resulting signal is then scaled to generate an appropriate tuning signal. When applied to the resonator through additional signal ports, the tuning signal electrically modifies the equivalent mechanical stiffness or mass of the resonator, thereby tuning the resonance frequency in a bidirectional fashion depending on the polarity of the scaling. This tuning scheme has been applied to a piezoelectric AlN-on-Si BAW square resonator to tune its 14.2 MHz resonance frequency by 22 kHz, equivalent to 1550 ppm.

In this work, we report the studies on the preparation and properties of barium titanate (BT)/ poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) composite thin films. The composite film was prepared by a modified process rather than the conventional method. The modified process adopted ballmilling technique instead of the stirring method to disperse BT nanoparticles into PVDF solution. Scanning electron microscopy images of the obtained composites show that the BT nanoparticles are incorporated into the PVDF network and are well dispersed in the matrix. When the BT volume fraction is 30%, the permittivity and breakdown strength of the composites reach their optimal values and the energy density reaches maximum value (5.3 J/cm3), an increase of 80% compared with that of the composites prepared using the stirring method. Another modification is the use of acetone and butanone mixed solution instead of N,N-dimethylformamide to dissolve the PVDF, which is beneficial to form pure \u03b1-PVDF composite films on the polyethylene terephthalate substrate by tape casting.

{"title": "Surface mapping of field-induced piezoelectric strain at elevated temperature employing full-field interferometry.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators and sensors are widely used for flow control valves, including diesel injectors, ultrasound generation, optical positioning, printing, pumps, and locks. Degradation and failure of material and electrical properties at high temperature typically limits these applications to operating temperatures below 200\u00b0C, based on the ubiquitous Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 ceramic. There are, however, many applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, energy and process control, and oil and gas, where the ability to operate at higher temperatures would open up new markets for piezoelectric actuation. Presented here is a review of recent progress and initial results toward a European effort to develop measurement techniques to characterize high-temperature materials. Full-field, multi-wavelength absolute length interferometry has, for the first time, been used to map the electric-field-induced piezoelectric strain across the surface of a PZT ceramic. The recorded variation as a function of temperature has been evaluated against a newly developed commercial single-beam system. Conventional interferometry allows measurement of the converse piezoelectric effect with high precision and resolution, but is often limited to a single point, average measurement and to limited sample environments because of optical aberrations in varying atmospheres. Here, the full-field technique allows the entire surface to be analyzed for strain and, in a bespoke sample chamber, for elevated temperatures.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-01-15", "authors": ["TimStevenson", "TatjanaQuast", "GuidoBartl", "ThorstenSchmitz-Kempen", "Paul MWeaver"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006683"}

The present work focuses on Sm-modified BFO ceramics of composition Bi0.88Sm0.12FeO3. The polarization and strain behaviors were investigated as a function of the phase composition, microstructure, and chemical composition. Addition of Sm reduces the susceptibility of the BFO perovskite to phase degradation by Si impurities. Si was observed to react into Sm-rich grains dispersed within the microstructure, with no large increases in the amount of bismuth-parasitic phases, namely Bi25FeO39 and Bi2Fe4O9.

Both dense films and films with 3 to 4 vol% porosity were measured. On application of electric fields exceeding the coercive field, it is shown that the porous films exhibit a greater volume fraction of ferroelastic domain reorientation (approximately 12 vol% of domains reorient at 3 times the coercive field, Ec) relative to the dense films (~3.5 vol% at 3Ec). Furthermore, the volume fraction of domain reorientation significantly exceeded that predicted by linear mixing rules. The high response of domain reorientation in porous films is discussed in the context of two mechanisms: local enhancement of the electric field near the pores and a reduction of substrate clamping resulting from the lowering of the film stiffness as a result of the porosity. Similar measurements during weak-field (subcoercive) amplitudes showed 0.6% volume fraction of domains reoriented for the porous films, which demonstrates that extrinsic effects contribute to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2015-01-15", "authors": ["Raegan LJohnson-Wilke", "Rudeger H TWilke", "MargeauxWallace", "AdarshRajashekhar", "GiovanniEsteves", "ZacharyMerritt", "Jacob LJones", "SusanTrolier-McKinstry"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006562"}

Structural and piezoelectric properties were closely related to the PbTiO3 concentration; below a critical concentration, relaxor-like behavior was identified. The mechanisms governing the piezoelectric behavior were investigated with structural, electrical, and imaging techniques. X-ray diffraction established that longrange non-centrosymmetric crystallographic order was evident above a critical PbTiO3 concentration, y > 0.1125. Commensurate with the structural analysis, electric-field-induced strain responses showed electrostrictive behavior in the PbTiO3-reduced compositions, with increased piezoelectric switching in PbTiO3-rich compositions. Positive-up-negative-down (PUND) analysis was used to confirm electric-field-induced polarization measurements, elucidating that the addition of PbTiO3 increased the switchable polarization and ferroelectric ordering. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) of the BF-KBT-PT system exhibited typical domain patterns above a critical PbTiO3 threshold, with no ferroelectric domains observed in the BF-KBT system in the pseudocubic region. Doping of BiFeO3-PbTiO3 has been unsuccessful in the search for hightemperature materials that offer satisfactory piezoelectric properties; however, this system demonstrates that the partial substitution of alternative end-members can be an effective method. The partial substitution of PbTiO3 into BF-KBT enables long-range non-centrosymmetric crystallographic order, resulting in increased polar order and TC, compared with the pseudocubic region.

However, lead is not desired from an environmental point of view, and to switch to alternative alkali-, Ba-, or Bi-based relaxor systems, one must understand in great detail the structural mesoscopic order and coupling processes responsible for the outstanding performance and multifunctionality of the exemplar Pb-based compounds. To elucidate the type of ferroic coupling, three relaxor compounds PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 (PST), Pb0.78Ba0.22Sc0.5Ta0.5O3 (PST-Ba), and PbSc0.5Nb0.5O3 (PSN), were studied by polarized Raman scattering and acoustic emission at different temperatures and under an external electric field. The results reveal the coexistence of mesoscopic-scale ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, which are predominantly related to B-site cations and A-site Pb cations, respectively. This suggests that the polar structural state of relaxors is frustrated ferrielectric.

To solve the problem, we propose a novel complete solution of a hand gesture control system employing immersive tactile feedback to the user's hand. For this goal, we first developed a fast and accurate hand-tracking algorithm with a Kinect sensor using the proposed MLBP (modified local binary pattern) that can efficiently analyze 3D shapes in depth images. The superiority of our tracking method was verified in terms of tracking accuracy and speed by comparing with existing methods, Natural Interaction Technology for End-user (NITE), 3D Hand Tracker and CamShift. As the second step, a new tactile feedback technology with a piezoelectric actuator has been developed and integrated into the developed hand tracking algorithm, including the DTW (dynamic time warping) gesture recognition algorithm for a complete solution of an immersive gesture control system. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the integrated system were conducted with human subjects, and the results demonstrate that our gesture control with tactile feedback is a promising technology compared to a vision-based gesture control system that has typically no feedback for the user's gesture inputs.

Moreover, the benefit of using multichannel systems as opposed to a single sensor is investigated. While it might seem intuitive that multiple channels are superior to a single channel, the main challenge lies in finding suitable methods to actually leverage this potential. To this end, two algorithms for heart rate estimation from multichannel vibration signals are presented and compared against a single-channel sensing solution. The first method operates by analyzing the cepstrum computed from the average spectra of the individual channels, while the second method applies Bayesian fusion to three interval estimators, such as the autocorrelation, which are applied to each channel. This evaluation is based on 28 night-long sleep lab recordings during which an eight-channel polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensor array was used to acquire cardiac vibration signals. The recruited patients suffered from different sleep disorders of varying severity. From the sensor array data, a virtual single-channel signal was also derived for comparison by averaging the channels.

Ectopic expression of miR-101 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. We found that miR-101 strongly reduced the expression of SOCS2 oncogene in GC cells. Similar to the restoring miR-26 expression, SOCS2 down-regulation inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression, whereas SOCS2 over-expression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-101. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-101 suppressed the expression of c-myc, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE2, while promoted tumor suppressor p14, p16, p21 and p27 expression.

The differently neutralized polyacid, alkali and ammonium polyacrylates are examined as polymeric binders for the preparation of Si-graphite composite electrodes as negative electrodes for Li-ion batteries. The electrode performance of the Si-graphite composite depends on the alkali chemicals and neutralization degree. It is found that 80% NaOH-neutralized polyacrylate binder (a pH value of the resultant aqueous solution is ca. 6.7) is the most efficient binder to enhance the electrochemical lithiation and de-lithiation performance of the Si-graphite composite electrode compared to that of conventional PVdF and the other binders used in this study. The optimum polyacrylate binder highly improves the dispersion of active material in the composite electrode. The binder also provides the strong adhesion, suitable porosity, and hardness for the composite electrode with 10% (m/m) binder content, resulting in better electrochemical reversibility.

A few years ago, in vitro and in vivo experimentation demonstrated that such fragmentation can be improved, without increasing tissue damage, by sending a second shock wave hundreds of microseconds after the previous wave. Later, numerical simulations revealed that if the second pulse had a longer full width at half maximum than a standard shock wave, cavitation could be enhanced significantly. On the other side, a theoretical study showed that stress inside the stone can be increased if two lithotripter shock waves hit the stone with a delay of only 20 \u03bcs. We used the Gilmore-Akulichev formulation to show that, in principle, both effects can be combined, that is, stress and cavitation could be increased using a pressure pulse with long full width at half maximum, which reaches the stone within hundreds of microseconds after two 20 \u03bcs-delayed initial shock waves.

Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray photoelectron trajectories suggest the formation of substantial local electric fields in the regions adjacent to those exposed to X-rays, indicating a possible electric-field-induced SHG (EFISH) mechanism for generating the observed signal. In studies of amorphous vitreous solvents, analysis of the SHG spatial profiles following X-ray microbeam exposure was consistent with an EFISH mechanism. Within protein crystals, exposure to 12-keV (1.033-\u00c5) X-rays resulted in increased SHG in the region extending \u223c 3 \u03bcm beyond the borders of the X-ray beam. Moderate X-ray exposures typical of those used for crystal centering by raster scanning through an X-ray beam were sufficient to produce static electric fields easily detectable by SHG. The X-ray-induced SHG activity was observed with no measurable loss for longer than 2 wk while maintained under cryogenic conditions, but disappeared if annealed to room temperature for a few seconds.

Here we demonstrated the first superior hydrophobic piezoelectric surface based on the polymer blend of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-polyacrilonitrile (PAN) assisted with functionalized multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs), by a modified electrospinning method. Typically the \u03b2-phase polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was considered as the excellent piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials. However, polar \u03b2-phase of PVDF exhibited a natural high hydrophilicity. As a well-known fact, the wettability of the surface is dominated by two major factors: surface composition and surface roughness. The significant conversions derived by the incorporation of MWNTs, from nonpolar \u03b1-phase to highly polar \u03b2-phase of PVDF, were confirmed by FTIR. Meanwhile, the effects of MWNTs on the improvement of the roughness and the hydrophobicity of polymer blend were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle (CA). Molar free energy of wetting of the polymer nanocomposite decreases with increasing the wt.% of MWNTs. All molar free energy of wetting of PVDF-PAN/MWNTs were negative, which means the non-wettability of film. The combination of surface roughness and low-surface-energy modification in nanostructured composites leads to high hydrophobicity.

However, many bimorphs suffer from the `junction effect': a periodic deformation of the optical surface which causes major aberrations to the reflected X-ray beam. This effect is linked to the construction of such mirrors, where piezo ceramics are glued directly below the thin optical substrate. In order to address this problem, a next-generation bimorph with piezos bonded to the side faces of a monolithic substrate was developed at Thales-SESO and optimized at Diamond Light Source. Using metrology feedback from the Diamond-NOM, the optical slope error was reduced to \u223c 0.5 \u00b5rad r.m.s. for a range of ellipses. To maximize usability, a novel holder was built to accommodate the substrate in any orientation. When replacing a first-generation bimorph on a synchrotron beamline, the new mirror significantly improved the size and shape of the reflected X-ray beam. Most importantly, there was no evidence of the junction effect even after eight months of continuous beamline usage.

{"title": "Observation of piezoelectricity in free-standing monolayer MoS\u2082.", "abstract": "Piezoelectricity allows precise and robust conversion between electricity and mechanical force, and arises from the broken inversion symmetry in the atomic structure. Reducing the dimensionality of bulk materials has been suggested to enhance piezoelectricity. However, when the thickness of a material approaches a single molecular layer, the large surface energy can cause piezoelectric structures to be thermodynamically unstable. Transition-metal dichalcogenides can retain their atomic structures down to the single-layer limit without lattice reconstruction, even under ambient conditions. Recent calculations have predicted the existence of piezoelectricity in these two-dimensional crystals due to their broken inversion symmetry. Here, we report experimental evidence of piezoelectricity in a free-standing single layer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS\u2082) and a measured piezoelectric coefficient of e\u2081\u2081 =\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-10)\u2005C\u2005m(-1). The measurement of the intrinsic piezoelectricity in such free-standing crystals is free from substrate effects such as doping and parasitic charges. We observed a finite and zero piezoelectric response in MoS\u2082 in odd and even number of layers, respectively, in sharp contrast to bulk piezoelectric materials. This oscillation is due to the breaking and recovery of the inversion symmetry of the two-dimensional crystal. Through the angular dependence of electromechanical coupling, we determined the two-dimensional crystal orientation.

Seven healthy pluriparous Holstein Friesian cows (3.7\u00b10.7 yr old, parity 2.4\u00b10.5, mean\u00b1SD) were used. Three weeks before calving, 4 piezoelectric crystals were implanted via laparotomy in the myometrium of the greater curvature of the pregnant uterine horn in a longitudinal direction. Sonometric measurements were conducted daily from 2 d before parturition until 14 d after calving, followed by measurements every other day until d 28. Changes in the distance between neighboring crystals were presented as relative changes (%) from baseline values before parturition. The diameter of the previously pregnant uterine horn was measured using transrectal B-mode sonography from d 10 to 28 after calving. The cows were slaughtered 39\u00b16 d postpartum and the uterus was evaluated for fixation of the crystals. The distances between neighboring crystals underwent changes with a reduction of greater than 50% until d 1 postpartum, but no further changes were recorded from d 1 to 7. In the second week, changes in all distances were affected by day postpartum. One distance was affected by day postpartum in wk 3 and 4. There was a positive correlation between the diameter of the previously pregnant horn and the distances between the crystals. Examination of the uterus after slaughter of the cows revealed that 8 crystals (29%) were no longer fixed in the myometrium.

The response of the device is in a linear relationship with IgG concentration. The biosensing performance of SiO2/ZnO NWs is much higher than that of bare ZnO NWs. A SiO2 layer uniformly coated on the surface of the ZnO NW acts as the gate insulation layer, which increases mechanical robustness and protects it from the electrical leakages and short circuits. The IgG biomolecules modified on the surface of the SiO2/ZnO NW act as a gate potential, and the field effect can influence the surface electron density of ZnO NWs, which varies the screening effect of free-carriers on the piezoelectric output.

While the load dependence of the diastolic function is established for the normal heart, little is known about the response of the acutely ischaemic and reperfused myocardium to alterations in afterload. What is the main finding and its importance? Using a model that simulates the clinical scenario of acute ischaemia-reperfusion, we show that increased afterload aggravates diastolic dysfunction during both acute ischaemia and reperfusion. In addition, increased afterload induces diastolic dyssynchrony, which might be the underlying mechanism of the diastolic dysfunction of the ischaemic myocardium. These findings provide us with new information regarding how better to manage patients who undergo revascularization therapy after acute myocardial infarction. The effects of changes in left ventricular (LV) afterload on diastolic function of acutely ischaemic and reperfused myocardium have not been studied in depth. We examined the following factors: (i)\u00a0the consequences of increasing the LV afterload on LV diastolic function during acute ischaemia and reperfusion; (ii)\u00a0whether the myocardial response to afterload elevation is stable throughout a 2\u00a0h reperfusion period; and (iii)\u00a0the role of LV wall synchrony in the development of afterload-induced diastolic dysfunction. We instrumented 12 anaesthetized, open-chest pigs with Millar pressure catheters and piezoelectric crystals before ligating mid-left anterior descending coronary artery for 1\u00a0h, followed by reperfusion for 2\u00a0h. Six of the animals survived throughout the 2\u00a0h of reperfusion, and their data were used for comparisons across the different experimental phases. Left ventricular afterload was increased by inflating an intra-aortic balloon. Data were recorded at baseline, after 20\u00a0min of coronary occlusion and at 30 and 90\u00a0min of myocardial reperfusion. The increased afterload for 2\u00a0min lengthened the isovolumic relaxation during ischaemia and during early and late reperfusion but had no significant effect on isovolumic relaxation before coronary artery occlusion. Increasing the afterload aggravated LV diastolic dyssynchrony during coronary artery occlusion, but not during reperfusion. The afterload-induced prolongation of isovolumic relaxation was positively correlated with afterload-induced diastolic dyssynchrony. These observations indicate that, during myocardial ischaemia and throughout reperfusion, LV diastolic function is afterload dependent.

A remarkable enhancement of the output voltage (\u223c32 V) of a nanogenerator (NG) based on a nonelectrically poled cerium(III) complex containing PVDF composite film is achieved by simple repeated human finger imparting, whereas neat PVDF does not show this kind of behavior.

This excites the piezoelectric effect on the cell membranes, in particular raising the potentials on the membranes of cancer cells from their depleted levels to near-normal levels. In a sample calculation, a gain of 150 mV in is so attained. This allows the Warburg effect to be reversed.

{"title": "Highly efficient piezotronic strain sensors with symmetrical Schottky contacts on the monopolar surface of ZnO nanobelts.", "abstract": "Piezotronic strain sensors have drawn a lot of attention since the piezotronic theory was established. In this work, we developed a flexible piezotronic strain sensor based on an indium-doped ZnO nanobelt, of which the top surface was the monopolar surface. By connecting two electrodes with the two ends of the top surface of the nanobelt, the strain sensor was constructed. Compared with a nanorod/nanowire based strain sensor, this monopolar surface device avoids the need to identify the polar direction. Under strain, a static potential with the same value and polarity was generated by the coupling effect of the piezoelectric effect and the Poisson effect. This induced piezopotential influenced the Schottky barrier heights at the interfaces of both the source and drain electrodes, resulting in current changes with the same trend at forward and reverse biases. By applying a series of periodical strains, the sensor showed clear, fast and accurate current responses. The gauge factor achieved for compressive strain was 4036. This type of piezotronic strain sensor with a polar surface facing upward presented a high performance and easier fabrication, showing promise for applications in electrical mechanical sensors and MEMS.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["ZhengZhang", "QingliangLiao", "XiaohuiZhang", "GuangjieZhang", "PeifengLi", "ShengnanLu", "ShuoLiu", "YueZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c4nr05597g"}

The immobilized amount of TiO2 was found to be 2.08, 2.44, 3.80, and 4.73 mg per 45 cm(2) of PVDF-TiO2 hybrids for the electrospraying of 10, 20, 40, and 60 ml of TiO2-DMF, respectively. The hybrid photocatalysts were effective in degrading bisphenol A (BPA), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), and cimetidine (CMT), which dissolved in both deionized water and secondary wastewater effluents, with activity being proportional to the quantity of TiO2 NPs immobilized. For the highest loading amount of TiO2, BPA, 4-CP, and CMT degraded completely within 100, 100, and 40 min of UV irradiation, respectively. Stable photo-oxidation of CMT was maintained through 10 repeated cycles. During these cycles, it was confirmed that there was no loss of TiO2 NPs by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.

However, knowledge regarding the detailed physiological mechanism behind this sensory improvement in the central nervous system, especially in the human brain, is limited, hindering progress in development and use of such assistive devices. To enable investigation of the impact of vibrotactile noise on sensorimotor brain activity in humans, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible vibrotactile system was developed to provide vibrotactile noise during an MRI of the brain. The vibrotactile system utilizes a remote (outside the MR room) signal amplifier which provides a voltage from -40 to +40\u2009V to drive a 12\u2009mm diameter piezoelectric vibrator (inside the MR room).

The most extensive data on this topic has been acquired in CANDU electrical generating stations, which use piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers manufactured commercially with minor accommodation for high radiation fields. They have been found to be reliable for cumulative gamma doses of up to approximately 2 MegaGrays; a brief summary is made of the associated accommodations required to the transducer design, and the ultimate expected failure modes. Outside of the CANDU experience, endurance data have been acquired under a diverse spectrum of operating conditions; this can impede a direct comparison of the information from different sources. Much of this data is associated with transducers immersed in liquid metal coolants associated with advanced reactor designs. Significant modifications to conventional designs have led to the availability of custom transducers that can endure well over 100 MegaGrays of cumulative gamma dose. Published data on transducer endurance against neutron fluence are reviewed, but are either insufficient, or were reported with inadequate description of test conditions, to make general conclusions on transducer endurance with high confidence.

PMMA, a mutually miscible polymer to both PVDF and ABS, improved the compatibility between the phases by localizing at the blends interface.

This phenomenon was strongly contingent on the concentration of PMMA in the blends. This strategy was further extended to localize graphene oxide (GO) sheets at the blends interface by chemically coupling it to PMMA (PMMA-g-GO). A dramatic increment of ca. 84% in the Young's modulus and ca. 124% in the yield strength was observed in the presence of PMMA-g-GO with respect to the neat blends. A simultaneous increment in both the strength and the modulus was observed in the presence of PMMA-g-GO whereas, only addition of GO resulted in a moderate improvement in the yield strength.

The direct piezoelectric effect of coefficient d36 indicates that under external in-plane shear stress the charge is induced on a face perpendicular to the poled z-direction. On thin plates, this type of piezoelectric wafer will generate shear horizontal (SH) waves in two orthogonal wave propagation directions as well as two Lamb wave modes in other wave propagation directions. Finite element analyses are employed to explore the wave disturbance in terms of time-varying displacements excited by the d36 wafer in different directions of wave propagation to understand all the guided wave modes accurately. Experiments are conducted to examine the voltage responses received by this type of wafer, and also investigate results of tuning frequency and effects of d31 piezoelectric coefficient, which is intentionally ignored in the finite element analysis.

{"title": "A new aptamer/graphene interdigitated gold electrode piezoelectric sensor for rapid and specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus.", "abstract": "A novel aptamer/graphene interdigitated gold electrode piezoelectric sensor was developed for the rapid and specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) by employing S. aureus aptamer as a biological recognition element. 4-Mercaptobenzene-diazonium tetrafluoroborate (MBDT) salt was used as a molecular cross-linking agent to chemically bind graphene to interdigital gold electrodes (IDE) that are connected to a series electrode piezoelectric quartz crystal (SPQC). S. aureus aptamers were assembly immobilized onto graphene via the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking of DNA bases. Due to the specific binding between S. aureus and aptamer, when S. aureus is present, the DNA bases interacted with the aptamer, thereby dropping the aptamer from the surface of the graphene. The electric parameters of the electrode surface was changed and resulted in the change of oscillator frequency of the SPQC. This detection was completed within 60min. The constructed sensor demonstrated a linear relationship between resonance frequency shifts with bacterial concentrations ranging from 4.1\u00d710(1)-4.1\u00d710(5)cfu/mL with a detection limit of 41cfu/mL.

Tests like mammography, which are used abundantly for the detection of breast cancer, suffer from serious limitations. Mammography correctly detects malignancy about 80-90% of the times, failing in places when (1) the tumor is small at early stage, (2) breast tissue is dense or (3) in women of less than 40 years. Serum-based detection of biomarkers involves risk of disease transfer, along with other concerns. These techniques compromise in the early detection of breast cancer. Early detection of breast cancer is a crucial factor to enhance the survival rate of patient. Development of regular screening tests for early diagnosis of breast cancer is a challenge. This review highlights the design of a handy and household biosensor device aimed for self-screening and early diagnosis of breast cancer.

This work measured the characteristics of piezoelectric effects under dynamic and static loading. The results show that the variations of piezovoltage in wet bone in both loading and load holding periods follow a stretched exponential relaxation law, and the relaxation time constants of the piezovoltages are much larger than those of dry bone. This finding means that the active time of piezovoltage in wet bone is much longer than that of dry bone. Regardless of the loading and load holding processes, continuously increasing deformation in wet bone caused piezoelectric charges to be continuously induced and increased the dielectric constant of wet bone along with the deformation process. In general, compared with piezovoltage in dry bone, that in wet bone had lower amplitude and could exist for a longer duration. It can be inferred, therefore, that piezoelectricity might create coupling with the streaming potential in bone by changing the thickness of the double electrode layer.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["LianyunXu", "ZhendeHou", "DonghuiFu", "Qing-HuaQin", "YihanWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.10.009"}

The k(2)eff distributions and the spacing of the parallel resonance frequency (SPRF) distributions are calculated for HBARs with different electrode and substrate materials. The frequency of first peak fM in k(2)eff distribution curve is close to the frequency of first valley in SPRF distribution curve, which has the maximum deviation of about 20%. The fM ratio of Al0.1\u03bcm-ZnO0.6\u03bcm-Au0.1\u03bcm-Sapphire400\u03bcm to Au0.1\u03bcm-ZnO0.6\u03bcm-Al0.1\u03bcm-Sapphire400\u03bcm is 1.91 which indicated that the k(2)eff distribution of HBAR is affected significantly by different electrode materials. We discuss for the first time the influence of the acoustic impedance ratio of the electrodes to substrate to the k(2)eff distribution, which is independent on the thickness ratio of the electrodes to piezoelectric film.

Calorimetric measurements are most commonly used for quantifying the dissipated ultrasonic power.

In this work, electrical power measurements were conducted at all locations in the piezoelectric ultrasonic system equipped with \u00bd\u2033 and \u00be\u2033 probes. A set of heat transfer calculations were developed to estimate the convection heat losses from the reaction solution. Chemical dosimeters represented by the oxidation of potassium iodide, Fricke solution and 4-nitrophenol were used to chemically correlate the effect of various electrical amplitudes and treatment regimes. This allowed estimation of sonochemical-efficiency (SE) and energy conversion (XUS) of the ultrasonic system. Results of this study showed overall conversion efficiencies of 60-70%. This correlated well with the chemical dosimeter yield curves of both organic and inorganic aqueous solutions. All dosimeters showed bubble shielding and coalescence effects at higher ultrasonic power levels, less pronounced for the \u00bd\u2033 probe case.

Formation of a pre-polymerization complex of the Nic template with ZnPc-S16 and EtOH-S4 was confirmed by both the high negative Gibbs free energy gain, \u0394G = -115.95 kJ/mol, calculated using the density functional theory at the B3LYP/3-21G* level, and the high stability constant, Ks = 4.67 \u00d7 10(5) M(-1), determined by UV-vis titration in chloroform.

The imprinting factor was as high as ~9.9.

Here, stereolithography (SLA) was employed to fabricate hydrogel scaffolds with open channels designed for post-seeding and perfused culture of primary hepatocytes that form 3D structures in a bioreactor. Photopolymerizable polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels were fabricated coupled to chemically activated, commercially available filters (polycarbonate and polyvinylidene fluoride) using a chemistry that permitted cell viability, and was robust enough to withstand perfused culture of up to 1\u2009\u00b5L/s for at least 7 days. SLA energy dose, photoinitiator concentrations, and pretreatment conditions were screened to determine conditions that maximized cell viability and hydrogel bonding to the filter. Multiple open channel geometries were readily achieved, and included ellipses and rectangles. Rectangular open channels employed for subsequent studies had final dimensions on the order of 350\u2009\u00b5m by 850\u2009\u00b5m. Cell seeding densities and flow rates that promoted cell viability were determined. Perfused culture of primary hepatocytes in hydrogel scaffolds in the presence of soluble epidermal growth factor (EGF) prolonged the maintenance of albumin production throughout the 7-day culture relative to 2D controls. This technique of bonding hydrogel scaffolds can be employed to fabricate soft scaffolds for a number of bioreactor configurations and applications.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2014-11-12", "authors": ["Jaclyn A ShepardNeiman", "RituRaman", "VincentChan", "Mary GRhoads", "Micha Sam BRaredon", "Jeremy JVelazquez", "Rachel LDyer", "RashidBashir", "Paula THammond", "Linda GGriffith"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.25494\n10.1002/adhm.201200318\n10.1002/hep.27150"}

To optimize the performance of such devices, it is essential to know the exact forces that the particles experience in the acoustic wave. Although much progress has been made via analytical and numerical modeling, the reliability of these methods relies strongly on the assumptions used, e.g. the boundary conditions. Here, we have combined an acoustic flow cell with an optical laser trap to directly measure the force on a single spherical particle in two dimensions. While performing ultrasonic frequency scans, we measured the time-averaged forces on single particles that were moved with the laser trap through the microfluidic cell. The cell including piezoelectric transducers was modeled with finite element methods. We found that the experimentally obtained forces and the derived pressure fields confirm the predictions from theory and modeling. This novel approach can now be readily expanded to other particle, chamber, and fluid regimes and opens up the possibility of studying the effects of the presence of boundaries, acoustic streaming, and non-linear fluids.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2014-11-06", "authors": ["StefanLak\u00e4mper", "AndreasLamprecht", "Iwan A TSchaap", "JurgDual"], "doi": "10.1039/c4lc01144a"}

The aim of this study was to develop a true size measuring system (TSM system) on magnified pinhole thyroid scan using an ultrasonic sensor.\nAn ultrasonic device capable of measuring the distance from the pinhole to the skin overlying the thyroid gland was manufactured using a ~40 kHz piezoelectric-transducer-based sensor, and its accuracy was tested. An interface program was developed and fused with the ultrasonic device for development of the TSM system. Accuracy of the TSM system for measuring size was tested with phantom images and 35 thyroid scans.\nThe ultrasonic device accurately measured the distance from the pinhole to the skin over the thyroid gland and the measured values were highly reproducible (6 cm; 6.02 \u00b1 0.04 cm, 8 cm; 8.00 \u00b1 0.05 cm, 10 cm; 10.00 \u00b1 0.05 cm). Distance on the phantom image corrected by the TSM system was almost the same as the true distance. Size of the thyroid on the pinhole image was larger (+67.3 to 103.1 %) than the true thyroid size on the parallel-hole image and the magnification decreased by increase of the distance between the pinhole and the skin over the thyroid gland. However, size of the thyroid obtained using the TSM system was almost equal (-2.1 to +3.6 %) to the true thyroid size on the parallel-hole image.\nWe developed the TSM system for magnified pinhole images using a distance measuring ultrasonic sensor.

These subtle and subclinical age-related changes make older adults more vulnerable to dysphagia during disease insults. However, there are limited studies of the swallowing process in older adults, because measurements are typically invasive or require exposure to X-rays. In the present study, we used integrated non-invasive measurements to determine aging-related changes of swallowing, and in the coordination of swallowing and respiration for a population of healthy participants.\nThe non-invasive system provided measurements of larynx movement with piezoelectric sensors, submental muscle activity with surface electromyography and respiration-swallowing coordination by measurement of nasal airflow.

The middle- and old-age groups had less expiratory-expiratory respiratory phase pattern than the young-age group. The probability of piecemeal deglutition was highest in the old-age group and lowest in the young-age group.

This paper presents air-coupled ultrasonic through-transmission measurements on a steel plate with thicknesses 10.15 mm; 10.0 mm; 9.8 mm. Ultrasound pulses were transmitted from a piezoelectric transducer at normal incidence, through the steel plate, and were received at the opposite side. The S1, A2 and A3 modes of the plate are excited, with resonance frequencies that depend on the material properties and the thickness of the plate. The results show that the resonances could be clearly identified after transmission through the steel plate, and that the frequencies of the resonances could be used to distinguish between the three plate thicknesses. The S1-mode resonance was observed to be shifted 10% down compared to a simple plane wave half-wave resonance model, while the A2 and S2 modes were found approximately at the corresponding plane-wave resonance frequencies. A model based on the angular spectrum method was used to predict the response of the through-transmission setup.

A brief reminder about perfluoroalkyl chains, fluorocarbons and fluorosurfactants is provided. The outstanding, otherwise unattainable physicochemical properties and combinations thereof of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are outlined, including extreme hydrophobic and lipophobic character; thermal and chemical stability in extreme conditions; remarkable aptitude to self-assemble into sturdy thin repellent protecting films; unique spreading, dispersing, emulsifying, anti-adhesive and levelling, dielectric, piezoelectric and optical properties, leading to numerous industrial and technical uses and consumer products. It was eventually discovered, however, that PFASs with seven or more carbon-long perfluoroalkyl chains had disseminated in air, water, soil and biota worldwide, are persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in animals and humans, raising serious health and environmental concerns. Further use of long-chain PFASs is environmentally not sustainable. Most leading manufacturers have turned to shorter four to six carbon perfluoroalkyl chain products that are not considered bioaccumulative. However, many of the key performances of PFASs decrease sharply when fluorinated chains become shorter. Fluorosurfactants become less effective and less efficient, provide lesser barrier film stability, etc. On the other hand, they remain as persistent in the environment as their longer chain homologues. Surprisingly little data (with considerable discrepancies) is accessible on the physicochemical properties of the PFASs under examination, a situation that requires consideration and rectification. Such data are needed for understanding the environmental and in vivo behaviour of PFASs.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics with explicit water molecules, we examine the response of FF monomers to the application of a constant external electric field over a range of intensities. We probe the aggregation mechanism of FF peptides, and find that the presence of even relatively weak fields can accelerate ordered aggregation, primarily by facilitating the alignment of individual molecular dipole moments. This is modulated by the conformational response of individual FF peptides (e.g., backbone stretching) and by the cooperative alignment of neighboring FF and water molecules.

The SAW is incident perpendicular to the vertical border. The dependencies of the reflection and transmission coefficient on the radius of the fillet at the corner are found for 128\u00b0YX and YZ LiNbO3 as well as ST-X SiO2 substrates. In particular, the obtained results reveal that, like in the case of isotropic solids, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient first increases with the fillet radius to wavelength ratio r/\u03bb, reaches a maximum at r/\u03bb\u22480.3-0.5, and then decreases tending to zero. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient across the rounded corner first decreases, reaches a minimum at r/\u03bb\u22480.3-0.5, and then increases up to a value around which it slightly oscillates as r/\u03bb increases. It is demonstrated that if the substrate is anisotropic, then in the general case a SAW is scattered off differently at the right-hand border and the left-hand border. The difference between the \"right-hand\" and \"left-hand\" transformation coefficients can be very substantial. Computations for YZ LiNbO3 illustrate possible levels of the anisotropy of the scattering for mutually reverse directions of incidence. It is shown that if the substrate is specially oriented, then the scattering from the right-hand border is identical to the scattering from the left-hand border. There are four types of such orientations.

Aluminum nitride has been retained for illustration, it is polarized along the thickness axis, and at the same time the material properties change gradually perpendicularly to the plate with an exponential variation. The effects of the gradient variation on the phase velocity and the coupling electromechanical factor are obtained. Appropriate curves are given to reflect their behavior with respect to frequency. The highest value of the electromechanical coupling factor has been observed for S0 mode, it is close to six percent, conversely for A0 mode it does not exceed 1.5%. The coupling factor maxima undergo a shift toward the high frequency area when the corresponding gradient coefficient increases. The Peano-series method computed under Matlab software, gives rapid convergence and accurate phase velocity when analysing Lamb waves in FGPM plate.

{"title": "Scaling-up ultrasound standing wave enhanced sedimentation filters.", "abstract": "Particle concentration and filtration is a key stage in a wide range of processing industries and also one that can be present challenges for high throughput, continuous operation. Here we demonstrate some features which increase the efficiency of ultrasound enhanced sedimentation and could enable the technology the potential to be scaled up. In this work, 20 mm piezoelectric plates were used to drive 100 mm high chambers formed from single structural elements. The coherent structural resonances were able to drive particles (yeast cells) in the water to nodes throughout the chamber. Ultrasound enhanced sedimentation was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the system (>99% particle clearance). Sub-wavelength pin protrusions were used for the contacts between the resonant chamber and other elements. The pins provided support and transferred power, replacing glue which is inefficient for power transfer. Filtration energies of \u223c4 J/ml of suspension were measured. A calculation of thermal convection indicates that the circulation could disrupt cell alignment in ducts >35 mm high when a 1K temperature gradient is present; we predict higher efficiencies when this maximum height is observed. For the acoustic design, although modelling was minimal before construction, the very simple construction allowed us to form 3D models of the nodal patterns in the fluid and the duct structure. The models were compared with visual observations of particle movement, Chladni figures and scanning laser vibrometer mapping. This demonstrates that nodal planes in the fluid can be controlled by the position of clamping points and that the contacts could be positioned to increase the efficiency and reliability of particle manipulations in standing waves.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2014-09-07", "authors": ["Jeff EPrest", "Bernard JTreves Brown", "Peter RFielden", "Stephen JWilkinson", "Jeremy JHawkes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2014.08.003"}

{"title": "A true theranostic approach to medicine: towards tandem sensor detection and removal of endotoxin in blood.", "abstract": "Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death around the world. The condition occurs when a local infection overcomes the host natural defense mechanism and suddenly spreads into the circulatory system, triggering a vigorous, self-injurious inflammatory host response. The pathogenesis of sepsis is relatively well known, one of the most potent immuno-activator being bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - also known as 'endotoxin'. Tests exist to detect endotoxin in bodily fluids, but are expensive, not necessarily user-friendly and require reporter molecules. In addition, the situation for safe and effective anti-endotoxin therapy is problematical. At the present time, endotoxin removal through cartridge hemoperfusion is one of the better alternatives to combat sepsis. The capability to both measure endotoxemia levels and offer an adapted response treatment in a timely manner is crucial for better management and improved prognosis, but is currently unavailable. In this context, we describe herein preliminary research towards the development of an alternative LPS biosensor and an innovative LPS neutralization cartridge to be eventually combined in an all-integrated configuration for the theranostic, personalized treatment of blood endotoxemia/sepsis. LPS detection is performed in a real-time and label-free manner in full human blood plasma, using ultra-high frequency acoustic wave sensing in combination with ultrathin, oligoethylene glycol-based mixed surface chemistry imposed on piezoelectric quartz discs. Biosensing platforms are functionalized with polymyxin B (PMB), a cyclic peptide antibiotic with high affinity for LPS. Analogous surface modification is used on glass beads for the therapeutic cartridge component of the combined strategy. Incubation of LPS-spiked whole blood with PMB-bead chemistry resulted in a significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 cytokine.

Therefore, mechanotransduction is crucial for organ development and homeostasis and plays a direct role in hearing, touch, proprioception, and pain. Multiple molecular players involved in mechanotransduction have been identified in the past, among them ion channels directly activated by cell membrane deformation. Most of these channels have well-established roles in lower organisms but are not conserved in mammals or fail to encode mechanically activated channels in mammals due to non-conservation of mechanotransduction property. A family of mechanically activated channels that counts only two members in human, piezo1 and 2, has emerged recently. Given the lack of valid mechanically activated channel candidates in mammals in the past decades, particular attention is given to piezo channels and their potential roles in various biological functions.

{"title": "Persistence of Functional Sensory Maps in the Absence of Cortical Layers in the Somsatosensory Cortex of Reeler Mice.", "abstract": "In rodents, layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex contains the barrel field, where individual, large facial whiskers are represented as a dense cluster of cells. In the reeler mouse, a model of disturbed cortical development characterized by a loss of cortical lamination, the barrel field exists in a distorted manner. Little is known about the consequences of such a highly disturbed lamination on cortical function in this model. We used in vivo intrinsic signal optical imaging together with piezo-controlled whisker stimulation to explore sensory map organization and stimulus representation in the barrel field. We found that the loss of cortical layers in reeler mice had surprisingly little incidence on these properties. The overall topological order of whisker representations is highly preserved and the functional activation of individual whisker representations is similar in size and strength to wild-type controls. Because intrinsic imaging measures hemodynamic signals, we furthermore investigated the cortical blood vessel pattern of both genotypes, where we also did not detect major differences. In summary, the loss of the reelin protein results in a widespread disturbance of cortical development which compromises neither the establishment nor the function of an ordered, somatotopic map of the facial whiskers.", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "date": "2014-04-25", "authors": ["JulienGuy", "Robin JWagener", "MartinM\u00f6ck", "Jochen FStaiger"], "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhu052"}
{"title": "Boron nitride nanotube-functionalised myoblast/microfibre constructs: a nanotech-assisted tissue-engineered platform for muscle stimulation.", "abstract": "In this communication, we introduce boron nitride nanotube (BNNT)-functionalised muscle cell/microfibre mesh constructs, obtained via tissue engineering, as a three-dimensional (3D) platform to study a wireless stimulation system for electrically responsive cells and tissues. Our stimulation strategy exploits the piezoelectric behaviour of some classes of ceramic nanoparticles, such as BNNTs, able to polarize under mechanical stress, e.g. using low-frequency ultrasound (US). In the microfibre scaffolds, C2C12 myoblasts were able to differentiate into viable myotubes and to internalize BNNTs, also upon US irradiation, so as to obtain a nanotech-assisted 3D in vitro model. We then tested our stimulatory system on 2D and 3D cellular models by investigating the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), as a molecule involved in cell crosstalk and mechanotransduction, and myosin, as a myogenic differentiation marker. Cx43 gene expression revealed a marked model dependency. In control samples (without US and/or BNNTs), Cx43 was upregulated under 2D culture conditions (10.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05-fold difference). Interactions with BNNTs increased Cx43 expression in 3D samples. Cx43 mRNA dropped in 2D under the 'BNNTs\u2009+\u2009US' regimen, while it was best enhanced in 3D samples (3.58\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05 vs 13.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.42-fold difference, p\u2009=\u20090.0001). At the protein level, the maximal expressions of Cx43 and myosin were detected in the 3D model. In contrast with the 3D model, in 2D cultures, BNNTs and US exerted a synergistic depletive effect upon myosin synthesis. These findings indicate that model dimensionality and stimulatory regimens can strongly affect the responses of signalling and differentiation molecules, proving the importance of developing proper in vitro platforms for biological modelling.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["SerenaDanti", "GianniCiofani", "GianniPertici", "StefaniaMoscato", "DelfoD'Alessandro", "ElenaCiabatti", "FedericaChiellini", "MarioD'Acunto", "VirgilioMattoli", "StefanoBerrettini"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1878"}
{"title": "Piezosurgery as a further technical adjunct in minimally invasive supraorbital keyhole approach and lateral orbitotomy.", "abstract": "One of the problems in neurosurgery is how to perform rapid and effective craniotomies that minimize the risk of injury to underlying eloquent structures. The traditional high-powered pneumatic tools and saws are efficient in terms of speed and penetration, but they can provoke bone necrosis and sometimes damage neurovascular structures. As an alternative, we evaluated the piezoelectric bone scalpel (piezosurgery), a device that potentially allows thinner and more precise bone cutting without lesioning neighboring delicate structures, even in the case of accidental contact.\nFrom January 2009 to December 2011, 20 patients (8 men and 12 women), 19 to 72 years of age (mean: 49.3 years) were treated using piezosurgery. Surgery was performed for the removal of anterior cranial fossa meningiomas, orbital tumors, and sinonasal lesions with intracranial extension.\nThe time required to perform craniotomy using piezosurgery is a few minutes longer than with traditional drills. No damage was observed using the piezoelectric device. Follow-up clinical and neuroradiologic evaluation showed a faster and better ossification of the bone flap with good esthetic results.\nPiezosurgery is a new promising technique for selective bone cutting with soft tissue preservation. This instrument seems suitable to perform precise thin osteotomies while limiting damage to the bone itself and to the underlying delicate structures even in the case of unintentional contact. These advantages make the piezoelectric bone scalpel a particularly attractive instrument in neurosurgery.", "journal": "Journal of neurological surgery.

This study investigates the suitability of a bio-integrative annulus implant.Standardized box defects were applied to the annulus L3/4 and L4/5 of 16 sheep, followed by randomized insertion of the textile polyglycolic acid/polyvinylidene fluoride annulus implant in one of the defects. Explantation was conducted after 2, 6 and 12 weeks, followed by provocative pressure testing and histological analysis. At 2 weeks' follow-up, all specimens of the control defect group demonstrated uncontained herniated nucleus pulposus tissue in the annulus defects. For the treated specimens, the annulus implant consistently provided an effective barrier for herniating nucleus pulposus tissue, with no implant dislocation at all time-points. After 2 weeks, a homogeneous cell infiltration of the annulus implant was observed, leading to a progressive directional matrix build-up. Repair tissue thickness was significantly stronger with the annulus implant at all follow-ups (p < 0.01). No pronounced foreign body reaction and no difference in the amount of supra-annular scar tissue over the defect sites were observed. The implantation procedure inflicted annulus damage adjacent to the defect. At later time-points, however, no difference in comparison with the control defect group was evident. The investigated biointegrative annulus implant showed promising results with regard to biointegration, enhancement of repair tissue and function as a mechanical barrier in an ovine model.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2013-11-15", "authors": ["Aldemar AndresHegewald", "FabianMedved", "DaxiongFeng", "CharalambosTsagogiorgas", "AnjaBeierfu\u00df", "Genevieve Ama KyremaaSchindler", "MarcusTrunk", "ChristianKaps", "Demissew ShenegelegnMern", "ClaudiusThom\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1831"}

Occurrence of membrane perforation, laceration of vascular branches, and surgical time was recorded.\nSeventy-two patients underwent sinus floor elevation: four perforations (11.1%) were observed in group A (two occurred during elevation with hand instruments) and zero perforations in group B (p\u2009<\u2009.05). No evidence of vascular lacerations was registered in both groups. A clinically insignificant but statistically shorter surgical time was recorded in group A (9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 minutes) than in group B (13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 minutes; p\u2009<\u2009.05).\nWithin the limits of the present study, it may be concluded that ultrasonic erosion of the lateral wall of the sinus is a more predictable technique than piezoelectric outlining of a bone window in preventing from accidental perforations of Schneiderian membrane during sinus augmentation procedures.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2013-08-24", "authors": ["ClaudioStacchi", "TomasoVercellotti", "AnnamariaToschetti", "StefanoSperoni", "StefanoSalgarello", "RobertoDi Lenarda"], "doi": "10.1111/cid.12136"}

Atraumatic extraction and implant osteotomy were performed with an ultrasonic surgery device without flap elevation. All sites received the same medication and surgical protocol; infected sites were ultrasonicated during 30\u2009seconds at 72\u2009W. Kaplan-Meyer survival rates were calculated at 1 year.\nThe 1-year survival rates of the noninfected, chronically, and acute infected groups were 98.8, 100, and 94.4%, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. No implant was lost after loading. All teeth and roots could be extracted in one piece. Drilling at extraction sockets was uncomplicated, without skidding.\nImplant survival rates might be similar in infected and noninfected sites when infected sites receive standard medical and surgical treatment and are ultrasonicated.

This study compares the incidence of membrane perforations using a sonic handpiece with an oscillating diamond insert versus a turbine handpiece with a conventional rotary diamond stone during lateral window sinus augmentation procedures.\nA retrospective chart analysis identified all lateral window sinus augmentation procedures done during a defined period. Among these procedures, those performed with a sonic handpiece and an oscillating diamond insert (experimental) and those performed with a conventional turbine and rotary diamond stone (conventional) were selected for this study. Reported occurrences of sinus membrane perforations during preparation of the osteotomy and elevation of the sinus membrane, as well as postoperative complications, were recorded and compared between treatment groups.\nNinety-three consecutive patients were identified for a total of 130 sinus augmentation procedures (51 conventional, 79 experimental). Schneiderian membrane perforations were noted during preparation of the lateral window osteotomy in 27.5% of the sinuses in the conventional group and 12.7% of sinuses in the experimental group. During membrane elevation, perforations were noted in 43.1% of the sinuses in the conventional group and 25.3% of sinuses in the experimental group. Both differences in perforation rates were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u2009.05).

{"title": "In vivo assessment of bone healing following Piezotome\u00ae ultrasonic instrumentation.", "abstract": "This pilot study evaluated the molecular, histologic, and radiographic healing of bone to instrumentation with piezoelectric or high speed rotary (R) devices over a 3-week healing period.\nFourteen Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) underwent bilateral tibial osteotomies prepared in a randomized split-leg design using Piezotome\u00ae (P1) (Satelec Acteon, Merignac, France), Piezotome 2\u00ae (P2) (Satelec Acteon), High-speed R instrumentation, or sham surgery (S). At 1 week, an osteogenesis array was used to evaluate differences in gene expression while quantitative analysis assessed percentage bone fill (PBF) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the defect, peripheral, and distant regions at 3 weeks. Qualitative histologic evaluation of healing osteotomies was also performed at 3 weeks.\nAt 1 week, expression of 11 and 18 genes involved in bone healing was significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.05) lower following P1 and P2 instrumentation, respectively, relative to S whereas 16 and 4 genes were lower relative to R. No differences in PBF or BMD were detected between groups within the osteotomy defect. However, significant differences in PBF (p\u2009=\u2009.020) and BMD (p\u2009=\u2009.008) were noted along the peripheral region between P2 and R groups, being R the group with the lowest values. Histologically, smooth osteotomy margins were present following instrumentation using P1 or P2 relative to R.\nPiezoelectric instrumentation favors preservation of bone adjacent to osteotomies while variations in gene expression suggest differences in healing rates due to surgical modality.
