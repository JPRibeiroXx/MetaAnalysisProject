This study was carried out on 47 buffaloes including; control buffaloes (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and buffaloes with TP (n\u00a0=\u00a027) at Assiut governorate, Egypt. All animals were subjected to thorough clinical examination, whole blood profiling, blood serum biochemical assays, and radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. The recorded ultrasonographic findings included; the contractility, contour and shape of the reticulum, shape and size of the heart and spleen involvement. All data were statistically analysed. Buffaloes with TP showed lymphocytic leucocytosis, increase in serum activities of AST, hyperproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperglobulinaemia. Radio-opaque metal foreign bodies, cardiomegaly and loss of the normal cardiac shape and contour were the most common radiographic findings in the diseased buffaloes. Ultrasonographically, the diseased buffaloes showed either acute pericarditis (n\u00a0=\u00a010) or chronic suppurative pericarditis (n\u00a0=\u00a017). Complete cessation of reticular contractions (0/3\u00a0min) and displacement of the reticulum from the diaphragm by a distance about 2.6-4.5\u00a0cm were the most common ultrasonographic findings of both types of pericarditis. In addition, the reticulum had uneven contour and the heart showed characteristic changes in its size, shape and contractility that was either accelerated or reduced. Reticular abscesses and peritoneal effusions were also imaged in all diseased buffaloes. In acute TP; the affected heart was enlarged with strong and clear cardiac contractions. Accumulation of hypoechoic fluids interspersed with echogenic deposits of fibrin within heart tissue and pericardium was observed. In chronic suppurative pericarditis, cardiomegaly, thickening of the cardiac wall and loss of the characteristic recognisable heart shape were the common ultrasonographic findings. Accumulation of hypoechoic fluids (usually pus) interspersing with echogenic deposits of fibrin within the pericardium, ventricles, atria and valves was also observed. In conclusion, ultrasonography with the aids of other diagnostic tools such as clinical findings, laboratory analysis and radiography has a high efficacy in evaluation of diseased buffaloes with TP.", "journal": "International journal of veterinary science and medicine", "date": "2018-09-27", "authors": ["ArafatKhalphallah", "EnasElmeligy", "Hanan KElsayed", "Bahaa Eldeen AAbedellaah", "DoaaSalman", "Al-Lethie AAl-Lethie", "Sara ABayoumi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.09.004"}

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role of Quercetin (Querc), alone or in combination with Melatonin (Melat) against cardiac damage induced by sodium nitrite (Sod nit), as well as to elucidate different signaling pathways. Querc and Melat were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), followed by induction of hypoxia in rats by using a single dose of Sod nit (60\u202fmg/kg, s.c.). Treatment with Sod nit significantly decreased hemoglobin (Hb) levels in blood. Pretreatment of hypoxic rats with Querc and/or Melat elevated the declined Hb concentration. The forementioned antioxidants also successfully ameliorated the alteration of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) and markers of cardiac injury, including troponin T (Trop. T), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF \u03b1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the rats serum. Furthermore, RT-PCR revealed that these antioxidants successfully modulated mRNA expression of NF-\u03baB, Bax, Bcl-2, and flt-1. They also regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the apoptosis marker caspase 3, and oxidative DNA damage in cardiac tissue, compared to Sod nit-intoxicated rats.

{"title": "Biological pacemakers: Concepts and techniques.", "abstract": "The sinoatrial (SA) node is the dominant pacemaker of the heart which initiates the process of impulse generation in the cardiac tissue, thereby defining the rate and rhythm of cardiac contraction. The automaticity of the conduction cells in the SA node is due to ion channels which are inter-linked by molecular, histological and electrophysiological mechanisms causing spontaneous diastolic depolarization and generation of an impulse. The SA nodal action potentials are then transmitted to the ventricles by electrical coupling of the myocytes in different areas of the heart. Regulatory pathways overseeing cardiac impulse generation and conduction provide effective and safe pacing, and help maintain the rate according to the physiological demands of the individual's body. Failure of physiological pacing due to any pathology in the SA or atrioventricular node necessitates implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Implantable pacemakers, despite technological advances, are not without practical limitations including a defined battery life leading to lead and/or generator replacement at periodic intervals, vascular complications, occasional component failure, electronic interference from external/ internal sources, e.g. myopotentials, electromechanical interference, etc., inadequate or incomplete physiological rate response to autonomic influences (devices have certain algorithms to address these issues) and most importantly the risk of infection.

It is comprised of multiple cell lineages, each integral for proper cardiac development, and include cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, epicardial cells and neural crest cells. The molecular mechanisms regulating cardiac development and morphogenesis are dependent on signaling crosstalk between multiple lineages through paracrine interactions, cell-ECM interactions, and cell-cell interactions, which together, help facilitate survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cardiac tissue. Aberrant regulation of any of these processes can induce developmental disorders and pathological phenotypes. Here, we will discuss each of these processes, the genetic factors that contribute to each step of cardiac development, as well as the current and future therapeutic targets and mechanisms of heart development and disease.

These results demonstrate that inhibiting lipid peroxidation and reducing myocardial and hepatocyte apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms by which MgIG exhibits hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects in DOX-treated mice.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2018-02-06", "authors": ["ZhonglinWu", "YuanyuanZhang", "TaoSong", "QiongtaoSong", "YingZhang", "XuanZhang", "XueHan", "JianpingZhang", "LiChu"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2017.5470\n10.1080/10915810701351228\n10.1046/j.1365-2036.1998.00309.x\n10.1007/s10753-015-0140-2\n10.3748/wjg.v21.i43.12370\n10.4238/2015.November.30.23\n10.1159/000235873\n10.1080/14740338.2016.1194824\n10.1016/j.redox.2013.01.014\n10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.06.005\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2009.00078.x\n10.1124/dmd.111.039123\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.08.017\n10.1111/bph.12795\n10.4103/0973-1482.131370\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01567.x\n10.2478/v10039-012-0063-1\n10.1016/j.apsb.2015.05.005\n10.1056/NEJMra052270\n10.1055/s-0032-1328588\n10.1007/s00421-005-1318-3\n10.1139/cjpp-74-8-904\n10.21037/hbsn.2016.01.01\n10.21037/hbsn.2016.05.07\n10.1002/jps.20874\n10.1177/1534735404270335\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124061\n10.1016/0891-5849(89)90032-4\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.06.009\n10.1016/S0378-4274(01)00329-0\n10.1016/j.tox.2004.12.003\n10.1155/2016/1959270\n10.1016/j.cbi.2015.05.013\n10.1007/s00005-009-0051-8\n10.1038/35019501\n10.1248/bpb.b13-00058\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.02.009"}

SD male rats were randomly divided into four groups: young control group, natural aging group, SPJ low dose group and SPJ high dose group, with 10 rats in each group. The rats in natural aging group, SPJ low and high dose groups were respectively treated with normal saline, SPJ 10 and 60 mg\u2022kg-1\u2022d-1 from the beginning of 18 month-old, 6 days per week for 6 months till 24 month-old.

Efforts in the attempt of finding new possible strategies for the treatment of CHF yielded several approaches based on the use of stem cells. The discovery of direct cardiac reprogramming has unveiled a new approach to heart regeneration, allowing, at least in principle, the conversion of one differentiated cell type into another without proceeding through a pluripotent intermediate. First developed for cancer treatment, nanotechnology-based approaches have opened new perspectives in many fields of medical research, including cardiovascular research. Nanotechnology could allow the delivery of molecules with specific biological activity at a sustained and controlled rate in heart tissue, in a cell-specific manner. Potentially, all the mediators and structural molecules involved in the fibrotic process could be selectively targeted by nanocarriers, but to date, only few experiences have been made in cardiac research.

{"title": "New Insights into the Immunobiology of Mononuclear Phagocytic Cells and Their Relevance to the Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "Macrophages are the primary immune cells that reside within the myocardium, suggesting that these mononuclear phagocytes are essential in the orchestration of cardiac immunity and homeostasis. Independent of the nature of the injury, the heart triggers leukocyte activation and recruitment. However, inflammation is harmful to this vital terminally differentiated organ with extremely poor regenerative capacity. As such, cardiac tissue has evolved particular strategies to increase the stress tolerance and minimize the impact of inflammation. In this sense, growing evidences show that mononuclear phagocytic cells are particularly dynamic during cardiac inflammation or infection and would actively participate in tissue repair and functional recovery. They respond to soluble mediators such as metabolites or cytokines, which play central roles in the timing of the intrinsic cardiac stress response. During myocardial infarction two distinct phases of monocyte influx have been identified. Upon infarction, the heart modulates its chemokine expression profile that sequentially and actively recruits inflammatory monocytes, first, and healing monocytes, later. In the same way, a sudden switch from inflammatory macrophages (with microbicidal effectors) toward anti-inflammatory macrophages occurs within the myocardium very shortly after infection with ",

{"title": "Microscale Biomaterials with Bioinspired Complexity of Early Embryo Development and in the Ovary for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) are attracting more and more attention for treating various diseases in modern medicine. Various biomaterials including hydrogels and scaffolds have been developed to prepare cells (particularly stem cells) and tissues under 3D conditions for TERM applications. Although these biomaterials are usually homogeneous in early studies, effort has been made recently to generate biomaterials with the spatiotemporal complexities present in the native milieu of the specific cells and tissues under investigation. In this communication, the microfluidic and coaxial electrospray approaches that we used for generating microscale biomaterials with the spatial complexity of both pre-hatching embryos and ovary in the female reproductive system were introduced. This is followed by an overview of our recent work on applying the resultant bioinspired biomaterials for cultivation of normal and cancer stem cells, regeneration of cardiac tissue, and culture of ovarian follicles. The cardiac regeneration studies show the importance of using different biomaterials to engineer stem cells at different stages (", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2018-01-26", "authors": ["XiaomingHe"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00540\n10.1038/Nrcardio.2010.159\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1038/nature06534\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.041\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105309\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243147\n10.1161/01.RES.0000265074.83288.09\n10.1126/science.1069210\n10.1073/pnas.1309408110\n10.1002/stem.1260\n10.1016/j.copbio.2008.08.005\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601896\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4630\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5272\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2012.12.009\n10.3324/haematol.2014.104711\n10.1177/1535370213506802\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.05.053\n10.1038/nature04957\n10.1126/science.1064829\n10.1038/nrm1858\n10.1038/nmeth.1939\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2015.08.012\n10.1007/s00441-011-1319-y\n10.1002/jcp.21174\n10.1074/jbc.R800027200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056158\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0352\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124701\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.06.005\n10.1002/stem.1467\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014076\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1021/ac2022794\n10.1039/c0cc00535e\n10.1586/erd.12.58\n10.1002/adma.201004275\n10.1039/C2TB00058J\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.003\n10.1002/mabi.201300474\n10.1039/c3lc50678a\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.028\n10.1002/ppsc.201500025\n10.1021/acsami.5b02708\n10.1002/adhm.201500133\n10.1039/c0lc00036a\n10.1002/adhm.201200341\n10.1115/1.3153326\n10.1073/pnas.192291499\n10.1021/acsnano.6b02206\n10.1002/mabi.200600069\n10.1088/0034-4885/75/1/016601\n10.1039/B510841a\n10.1021/acsami.5b00655\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.11.002\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9\n10.1093/bmb/ldp028\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000350\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1038/nm1108-1190\n10.1093/humupd/dml022\n10.1210/er.2009-0006\n10.1038/35066065\n10.1056/NEJMoa0803072\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60834-5\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.043\n10.2217/fon.12.47\n10.1007/s11427-012-4355-2\n10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181f97a55\n10.1056/NEJMra0801454\n10.1093/humupd/dmi012\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.08.010\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.07.006\n10.1210/Me.2005-0504\n10.1126/science.1171396\n10.1071/RD09161\n10.1126/science.1092463\n10.1126/science.1193573\n10.1093/molehr/gam036\n10.1007/s10815-010-9478-4\n10.1126/science.1069981\n10.1002/adma.201202553"}
{"title": "Hemodynamics Modify Collagen Deposition in the Early Embryonic Chicken Heart Outflow Tract.", "abstract": "Blood flow is critical for normal cardiac development. Hemodynamic stimuli outside of normal ranges can lead to overt cardiac defects, but how early heart tissue remodels in response to altered hemodynamics is poorly understood. This study investigated changes in tissue collagen in response to hemodynamic overload in the chicken embryonic heart outflow tract (OFT) during tubular heart stages (HH18 to HH24, ~24 h). A suture tied around the OFT at HH18 was tightened to constrict the lumen for ~24 h (constriction range at HH24: 15-60%). Expression of fibril collagens I and III and fibril organizing collagens VI and XIV were quantified at the gene and protein levels via qPCR and quantitative immunofluorescence. Collagen I was slightly elevated upstream of the band and in the cushions in banded versus control OFTs. Changes in collagen III were not observed. Collagen VI deposition was elevated downstream of the band, but not overall. Collagen XIV deposition increased throughout the OFT, and strongly correlated to lumen constriction.

{"title": "The Palm-Heart Diameter: A Prospective Simple Screening Tool for Identifying Heart Enlargement.", "abstract": "Several speculations have linked the size of the fist to be equal to the size of the heart. However, the substantial scientific report still lacks to support this theory.\nThis study aims to provide the validity of the fist-heart assumption by correlating the palm and heart diameters while benchmarking it as a reference tool for determining the normal heart size.\nVolunteers from the public were recruited during a health fair organised by the school. A self-administered questionnaire for necessary information was distributed after the volunteers signed the consent forms. The palm of both hands was measured in duplicates using a flexible ruler. Ultrasound examination was used in measuring the diameter of the heart with the landmark being from the anterior fibrous pericardium to the lowest part of the posterior fibrous pericardium. The level of significance was kept at P < 0.05.\nA total of 275 people, consisting of 123 males and 152 females participated in the study. The age range was from 15 to 80 years with a mean age of 28.16 \u00b1 16.18. The measurement showed that the size of both palms correlated with the heart diameter, p < 0.05. Other factors such as age and height showed a substantial level of correlation. However, this correlation ceased with older participants. Palm size did not correlate among participants with previously diagnosed prehypertension. However, participants with previously diagnosed hypertension with good medication compliance maintained the correlation.\nThis study establishes the correlation between the palm and heart diameters.

{"title": "Interleukin-6 and hepcidin expression changes in cardiac tissue of long-term trained and untrained rats after exhaustive exercise.", "abstract": "Background/aim: Exercise benefits the cardiovascular system, but strenuous exercise can cause cardiac damage and induce cytokine production, particularly that of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hepcidin, which is primarily regulated by IL-6, increases after exercise. Hepcidin is a possible protective factor against the adverse effects of strenuous exercise such as oxidative stress. The aim of the study is to reveal that training increases hepcidin and attenuates increased levels of IL-6 in the hearts of exhaustively exercised rats by comparing the IL-6 and hepcidin mRNA expression levels in trained and untrained groups.Materials and methods: Thirty male Wistar albino rats were assigned to the following groups: sedentary controls (Con); untrained animals that acutely completed exhaustive exercise and were sacrificed immediately after exhaustion (UT-i) or 1 day after exhaustion (UT-1); and long-term trained animals that completed exhaustive exercise and were sacrificed immediately after exhaustion (T-i) or 1 day after exhaustion (T-1). mRNA levels were examined by reverse transcription PCR. Results: IL-6 levels significantly increased in the UT-i, T-i, and T-1 groups compared to the Con group (P = 0.000, P = 0.024, P = 0.001), with maximal IL-6 expression found in the UT-i group. Hepcidin levels significantly increased in the T-1 group (P = 0.000) compared to the control. Conclusion: Increased IL-6 levels in rats show that exhaustive exercise can cause cardiac inflammation. However, long-term training attenuated the severity of the inflammation.

However, its pathogenesis is still not entirely understood. The aim of this paper was to explore the mechanisms and new drug targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model on H9C2 cells and the in vivo models on rats and mice were developed. The results showed that DOX markedly decreased H9C2 cell viability, increased the levels of CK, LDH, caused histopathological and ECG changes in rats and mice, and triggered myocardial oxidative damage via adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Total of 18 differentially expressed microRNAs in rat heart tissue caused by DOX were screened out using microRNA microarray assay, especially showing that miR-140-5p was significantly increased by DOX which was selected as the target miRNA. Double-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-140-5p directly targeted Nrf2 and Sirt2, as a result of affecting the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a, and thereby increasing DOX-caused myocardial oxidative damage. In addition, the levels of intracellular ROS were significantly increased or decreased in H9C2 cells treated with DOX after miR-140-5p mimic or miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection, respectively, as well as the changed expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2. Furthermore, DOX- induced myocardial oxidative damage was worsened in mice treated with miR-140-5p agomir, and however the injury was alleviated in the mice administrated with miR-140-5p antagomir. Therefore, miR-140-5p plays an important role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting myocardial oxidative stress via targeting Nrf2 and Sirt2. Our data provide novel insights for investigating DOX-induced heart injury. In addition, miR-140-5p/ Nrf2 and miR-140-5p/Sirt2 may be the new targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2018-01-06", "authors": ["LishaZhao", "YanQi", "LinaXu", "XufengTao", "XuHan", "LianhongYin", "JinyongPeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2017.12.013"}

{"title": "The adaptive immune response to cardiac injury-the true roadblock to effective regenerative therapies?", "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of adult human tissues and organs is limited, but recent developments have seen the advent of promising new technologies for regenerative therapy. The human heart is of particular interest for regenerative medicine, as cardiac tissue damage is repaired by the formation of rigid scar tissue, which causes inevitable structural changes and progressive functional decline leading to heart failure. Cardiac regenerative medicine aims to prevent scar formation or replace existing scars to halt or reverse adverse remodeling and therapeutic approaches include the use of biomaterials, gene therapies, delivery of growth factors, and (stem) cell therapies. Regenerative therapies, however, face significant obstacles in a hostile microenvironment. While the early immune response to a myocardial infarct is essential to ensure tissue integrity and to avoid fatal cardiac rupture, excessive activation of endogenous repair mechanisms may lead to ongoing inflammation, fibrosis, and sustained autoimmune-mediated tissue damage. Anti-cardiac autoreactivity of the adaptive immune system has been suggested to be involved in structural remodeling, functional decline, and the development of heart failure. It is, therefore, crucial to first understand the endogenous response to cardiac tissue damage and how to restore immune tolerance to cardiac tissue, before additional regenerative therapies can achieve their full potential.", "journal": "NPJ Regenerative medicine", "date": "2018-01-06", "authors": ["SusanneSattler", "PaulFairchild", "Fiona MWatt", "NadiaRosenthal", "Sian EHarding"], "doi": "10.1038/s41536-017-0022-3\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243360\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31823ac046\n10.1136/hrt.2005.062018\n10.1016/S1388-9842(00)00141-0\n10.1007/s11936-016-0479-1\n10.1002/emmm.201201737\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006681\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034004\n10.1080/10408363.2016.1176987\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304377\n10.1016/j.tcm.2015.01.014\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1097/MCA.0b013e32834523f8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.082453\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222703\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.05.003\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307647\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.724\n10.1002/stem.2205\n10.1038/nri2215\n10.1038/nri724\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.07.005\n10.1016/0002-9149(85)91024-0\n10.1016/j.jash.2008.10.004\n10.1016/j.autrev.2014.08.021\n10.1016/j.autrev.2005.09.006\n10.1172/JCI12673\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.04.023\n10.1038/nm.3284\n10.1016/j.coi.2008.03.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000130526.20854.fa\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.07.020\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044164\n10.1536/ihj.52.382\n10.1007/s00395-011-0232-6\n10.1038/cmi.2014.74\n10.1128/JVI.75.13.5860-5869.2001\n10.1128/JVI.76.21.10785-10790.2002\n10.1155/2015/484357\n10.1161/JAHA.114.000839\n10.1016/j.coph.2006.10.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.647230\n10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00148-6\n10.1016/S0002-9149(83)80148-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.616219\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.09.092\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.18.2254\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.026\n10.1038/nbt.2960\n10.1155/2013/167086\n10.1038/nri3227\n10.2337/db13-0886\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208456\n10.3109/08916934.2011.647134\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004406"}

{"title": "High resolution 3D microscopy study of cardiomyocytes on polymer scaffold nanofibers reveals formation of unusual sheathed structure.", "abstract": "Building functional and robust scaffolds for engineered biological tissue requires a nanoscale mechanistic understanding of how cells use the scaffold for their growth and development. A vast majority of the scaffolds used for cardiac tissue engineering are based on polymer materials, the matrices of nanofibers. Attempts to load the polymer fibers of the scaffold with additional sophisticated features, such as electrical conductivity and controlled release of the growth factors or other biologically active molecules, as well as trying to match the mechanical features of the scaffold to those of the extracellular matrix, cannot be efficient without a detailed knowledge of how the cells are attached and strategically positioned with respect to the scaffold nanofibers at micro and nanolevel. Studying single cell - single fiber interactions with the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning probe nanotomography (SPNT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that cardiac cells actively interact with substrate nanofibers, but in different ways. While cardiomyocytes often create a remarkable \"sheath\" structure, enveloping fiber and, thus, substantially increasing contact zone, fibroblasts interact with nanofibers in the locations of focal adhesion clusters mainly without wrapping the fiber.\nWe found that cardiomyocytes grown on electrospun polymer nanofibers often create a striking \"sheath\" structure, enveloping fiber with the formation of a very narrow (\u223c22\u202fnm) membrane gap leading from the fiber to the extracellular space. This wrapping makes the entire fiber surface available for cell attachment. This finding gives a new prospective view on how scaffold nanofibers may interact with growing cells. It may play a significant role in effective design of novel nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering concerning mechanical and electrical properties of scaffolds as well as controlled drug release from \"smart\" biomaterials.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-12-31", "authors": ["VictorBalashov", "AntonEfimov", "OlgaAgapova", "AlexanderPogorelov", "IgorAgapov", "KonstantinAgladze"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.031"}

However, data related to calcium channel dysfunction in heart failure is divergent and contradictory ranging from reduced function to no change in the calcium current. Many recent studies have highlighted the importance of functional and spatial microdomains in the heart and that may be the key to answer several puzzling questions. In this review, we have briefly discussed the types of VGCCs found in heart tissues, their structure, and significance in the normal and pathological condition of the heart. More importantly, we have reviewed the modulation of VGCCs by \u03b2ARs in normal and pathological conditions incorporating functional and structural aspects. There are different types of \u03b2ARs, each having their own significance in the functioning of the heart.

However, the role of Pin1 in cardiac fibrosis remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the potential mechanism of Pin1 in isoprenaline (ISO)\u2011induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. Echocardiography was used to evaluate changes in the size, shape and function of the heart, and histological staining was performed to visualize inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunohistochemistry and Picrosirius red staining were used to differentiate collagen subtypes. Additionally, cardiac\u2011specific phosphorylation of mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase kinase\u00a01/2 (MEK1/2) and extracellular\u2011signal regulated protein kinase\u00a01/2 (ERK1/2), and the activities of Pin1 and \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2011SMA) and other oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the heart. The administration of ISO resulted in an increase in cardiac parameters and elevated the heart\u2011to\u2011body weight ratio. Histopathological examination of heart tissues revealed interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltrate and disorganized collagen fiber deposition. In addition, lipid peroxidation products and oxidative stress marker activity in plasma and tissues were significantly increased in the ISO\u2011treated rats. Western blot analysis showed significantly elevated protein levels of phosphorylated Pin1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and \u03b1\u2011SMA in remodeling hearts. Treatment with juglone following intraperitoneal injection of ISO significantly prevented inflammatory cell infiltration, improved cardiac function, and suppressed oxidative stresses and fibrotic alterations. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that the activation of Pin1 promoted cardiac extracellular matrix deposition and oxidative stress damage by regulating the phosphorylation of the MEK1/2\u2011ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the expression of \u03b1\u2011SMA. By contrast, the inhibition of Pin1 alleviated cardiac damage and fibrosis in the experimental models, suggesting that Pin1 contributed to the development of cardiac remodeling in ISO\u2011administered rats, and that the inactivation of Pin1 may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2017-12-30", "authors": ["XianWu", "MingjiangLi", "Su-QinChen", "ShaLi", "FurongGuo"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2017.3354\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2016.10.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.056952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0091877\n10.1016/j.imr.2014.10.002\n10.1042/CS20150502\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2016.06.020\n10.3390/ijms17122001\n10.1111/febs.13943\n10.1074/mcp.O116.063487\n10.1038/nrm2261\n10.1038/ncb0505-435\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.05.010\n10.1038/srep43639\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.12.025\n10.1038/nature01832\n10.1016/j.tibs.2011.07.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301084\n10.1074/jbc.M113.526442\n10.1016/j.fsi.2008.07.007\n10.1186/1472-6882-6-32\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005\n10.1016/j.jbior.2013.02.001\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu179\n10.1155/2014/260429\n10.1002/ejhf.430\n10.1172/JCI17664\n10.1126/science.1176009\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80273-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.03.018\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361\n10.1074/jbc.M111.313684\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.050\n10.1007/s00018-013-1321-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00110.2003\n10.1073/pnas.0610906104\n10.1002/humu.20748\n10.1093/cvr/cvq308\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166845\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150093\n10.1074/jbc.M009160200\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.582239\n10.1152/ajpheart.00023.2006\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01123-2\n10.1126/science.1135380"}

The cut\u2011off criterion of P<0.08 was set to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Their enrichment functions were predicted by Gene Ontology. The enriched pathways were forecasted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Reactome analysis. Protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) networks for DEGs were constructed using Cytoscape. The present study identified 869 and 802 DEGs in E13.5 group and E15.5 group, respectively and 182 DEGs were shared by the two developmental stages. The pathway enrichment analysis results revealed that DEGs including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1) and H2\u2011M9 were enriched in cell adhesion molecules; DEGs including bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A, transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor 1 and SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 were enriched in the tumor growth factor\u2011\u03b2 signaling pathway.

Soluble ST2 (sST2) is one of the main isoforms of ST2 with strong prognostic value in cardiac disease. The exact role of sST2 in cardiac fibrosis is unknown. The aim of this study was (1) to investigate myocardial expression of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in relation to myocardial fibrosis in end-stage heart failure patients and (2) to study whether plasma sST2 is associated with histologically determined cardiac fibrosis. In 38 patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation, mRNA expression of sST2, total ST2, and IL-33 was measured in cardiac tissue obtained during the implantation. In the same tissue, histological fibrosis was digitally quantified and mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic signaling molecules, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21), was measured. In addition, plasma levels of sST2 were determined. Expression levels of IL-33/ST2 pathway factors in myocardial tissue were significantly associated with cardiac fibrosis and the expression levels of CTGF and TGF\u03b21. Plasma levels of sST2 did not correlate with tissue expression of ST2, the amount of fibrosis or myocardial expression of pro-fibrotic signaling proteins. The interleukin-33/ST2 pathway is expressed in the failing human heart and its expression is associated with cardiac fibrosis and pro-fibrotic signaling proteins, suggesting a role in pro-fibrotic myocardial remodeling.

Outcomes were virtually identical to the current gold standards for contraction measurement, such as optical flow, post deflection, edge-detection systems, or manual analyses.

Gelatin and Laponite\u00ae were combined to formulate a shear-thinning, nanocomposite hydrogel (nSi Gel) as an injectable carrier of secretome (nSi Gel+). The growth factor composition and the pro-angiogenic activity of the secretome were tested in vitro by evaluating the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical endothelial cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the nSi Gel\u202f+\u202fsystem was then investigated in vivo in rats by intramyocardial injection into the peri-infarct region. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, scar formation, and heart function were assessed. Biocompatibility of the developed nSi Gel was confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical tests which showed no significant differences in the level of inflammatory genes, microRNAs, and cell marker expression compared to the untreated control group. In addition, the only group that showed a significant increase in capillary density, reduction in scar area and improved cardiac function was treated with the nSi Gel+. Our in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate the potential of this new secretome-loaded hydrogel as an alternative strategy to treat myocardial infarction.\nStem cell based-therapies represent a possible solution to repair damaged myocardial tissue by promoting cardioprotection, angiogenesis, and reduced fibrosis. However, recent evidence indicates that most of the positive outcomes are likely due to the release of paracrine factors (cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes) from the cells and not because of the local engraftment of stem cells. This cocktail of essential growth factors and paracrine signals is known as secretome can be isolated in vitro, and the biomolecule composition can be controlled by varying stem-cell culture conditions.

Methods Cardiomyocytes of SD fetal rats from pregnant rats on gestational day 19 were obtained by digesting cardiac tissues with 0.8 g/L trypsin and 0.4 g/L collagenase II. With differential centrifugation and different animal serums (bovine fetal serum or horse serum), we tried to look for the optimal culture conditions. The morphology and beat frequency of cardiomyocytes were observed under an inverted phase-contrast microscope. In addition, the expressions of alpha-sarcomeric actinin (\u03b1-SA) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the cultured cardiomyocytes were detected by immunofluorescence staining to identify cardiomyocytes and the purity of these cells after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of cultivation.

Benznidazole is still the drug of choice in many countries to treat it in spite of its dosage regimen and adverse side effects such as such as allergic dermatitis, peripheral neuropathy and anorexia. Thus, novel, safer, and more efficacious treatments for such neglected infection are urgently required.\nIn this study, the efficacy of orally administered low doses of benznidazole (BNZ) nanoparticles was evaluated during the acute phase in mice infected with T. cruzi Nicaragua (TcN) that were immunosuppressed during the chronic stage of the disease. Moreover, the production of T. cruzi-specific antibodies, cardiac tissue inflammation and reactive oxygen species generation by Vero cells treated with both BNZ nanoparticles (BNZ-nps) and raw BNZ (R-BNZ) were also evaluated.\nT. cruzi infected mice treated with 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg/day of BNZ-nps survived until euthanasia (92 days post infection (dpi)), while only 15% of infected untreated mice survived until the end of the experiment. PCR analysis of blood samples taken after induction of immunosuppression showed that a dosage of 25 mg/kg/day rendered 40% of the mice PCR-negative. The histological analysis of heart tissue showed a significant decrease in inflammation after treatments with 25 and 50 mg/kg/day, while a similar inflammatory damage was observed in both infected mice treated with R-BNZ (50 mg/kg/day) and untreated mice. In addition, only BNZ-nps treated mice led to lower levels of T. cruzi-specific antibodies to 50-100%. Finally, mammalian Vero cells treated with BNZ-nps or R-BNZ lead to a significant increase in ROS production.\nBased on these findings, this research highlights the in-vitro/in-vivo efficacy of nanoformulated BNZ against T. cruzi acute infections in immunosuppressed and non-immunosuppressed mice and provides further evidence for the optimization of dosage regimens to treat Chagas disease.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2017-12-22", "authors": ["Marcela SRial", "Mar\u00eda LScalise", "Eva CArr\u00faa", "M\u00f3nica IEsteva", "Claudio JSalomon", "Laura EFichera"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0006119\n10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70002-1\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003981\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001870\n10.1002/jps.23010\n10.1586/14787210.7.2.157\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.01.014\n10.1007/s00436-010-2002-z\n10.1016/j.exppara.2010.05.010\n10.2174/157488551001150825095729\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.11.025\n10.4269/ajtmh.15-0889\n10.1016/j.exppara.2008.09.007\n10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.05.016\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000797\n10.1016/0022-1759(92)90008-H\n10.1017/S0031182013000176\n10.1586/14779072.2015.1103648\n10.2174/138161281941131219135458\n10.1016/S0378-5173(02)00453-2\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2004.03.025\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.03.010\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.02.001\n10.1038/nm1744\n10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030356\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002847\n10.1128/AAC.00745-15\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.3.1594\n10.1016/0742-8413(88)90090-4\n10.2217/nnm.14.185"}
{"title": "Mechanisms of right heart disease in pulmonary hypertension (2017 Grover Conference Series).", "abstract": "Current dogma is that pathological hypertrophy of the right ventricle is a direct consequence of pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, progression of right ventricle dysfunction is not always lung-dependent. Increased afterload caused by pulmonary vascular remodeling initiates the right ventricle hypertrophy, but determinants leading to adaptive or maladaptive hypertrophy and failure remain unknown. Ischemia in a hypertrophic right ventricle may directly contribute to right heart failure. Rapidly enlarging cardiomyocytes switch from aerobic to anaerobic energy generation resulting in cell growth under relatively hypoxic conditions. Cardiac muscle reacts to an increased afterload by over-activation of the sympathetic system and uncoupling and downregulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Recent studies suggest that \u03b2 blocker therapy in PH is safe, well tolerated, and preserves right ventricle function and cardiac output by reducing right ventricular glycolysis. Fibrosis, an evolutionary conserved process in host defense and wound healing, is dysregulated in maladaptive cardiac tissue contributing directly to right ventricle failure. Despite several mechanisms having been suggested in right heart disease, the causes of maladaptive cardiac remodeling remain unknown and require further research.", "journal": "Pulmonary circulation", "date": "2017-12-22", "authors": ["KewalAsosingh", "SerpilErzurum"], "doi": "10.1177/2045893217753121"}

The differentially expressed gene protein interaction analysis revealed a most obvious protein (NFKBIA) as the core, which might be related to inhibiting the differentiation of macrophage-derived foam cell and promoting cholesterol discharge and decomposition.\nGene expression of heart tissue in dogs fed with low-salt diet is significantly changed and low-salt diet may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by up-regulating the expression of NFKBIA.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u5bf9\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u82af\u7247\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08GEO\uff09\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u57fa\u56e0\u82af\u7247\u6570\u636e\uff08GSE17149\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5165Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.1\u3001STRING 10.0\u3001Genclip 2.0\u3001GCBI\u7b49\u5206\u6790\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u7ec4\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u996e\u98df\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u52a8\u7269\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u7f16\u7801\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e24\u7ec4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u57fa\u56e0\u3002\n\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u996e\u98df\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u7ec4\u72ac\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u8c31\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u572843 035\u4e2a\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5171\u67091343\u4e2a\uff083.12%\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\uff1b\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b01\u4e2a\u6700\u660e\u663e\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5NF-\u03baB\u6291\u5236\u56e0\u5b50-\u03b1\uff08NFKBIA\uff09\u86cb\u767d\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u6325\u51cf\u5f31\u5de8\u566c\u7ec6\u80de\u6e90\u6027\u6ce1\u6cab\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u5316\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u80c6\u56fa\u9187\u6392\u51fa\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u52a8\u7269\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u57fa\u56e0\u8f6c\u5f55\u8c31\u53d1\u751f\u660e\u663e\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u4f4e\u76d0\u996e\u98df\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8c03 ", "journal": "Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Long-term right ventricular (RV) overload leads to RV dysfunction and failure, which are the main determinants of life expectancy in PAH subjects. Therapeutic options for PAH remain limited, despite the introduction of prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators within the last 15 years. Through addressing the pulmonary endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunctions associated with PAH, these interventions delay disease progression but do not offer a cure.

{"title": "A finite element model of myocardial infarction using a composite material approach.", "abstract": "Computational models are effective tools to study cardiac mechanics under normal and pathological conditions. They can be used to gain insight into the physiology of the heart under these conditions while they are adaptable to computer assisted patient-specific clinical diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. Realistic cardiac mechanics models incorporate tissue active/passive response in conjunction with hyperelasticity and anisotropy. Conventional formulation of such models leads to mathematically-complex problems usually solved by custom-developed non-linear finite element (FE) codes. With a few exceptions, such codes are not available to the research community. This article describes a computational cardiac mechanics model developed such that it can be implemented using off-the-shelf FE solvers while tissue pathologies can be introduced in the model in a straight-forward manner. The model takes into account myocardial hyperelasticity, anisotropy, and active contraction forces. It follows a composite tissue modeling approach where the cardiac tissue is decomposed into two major parts: background and myofibers. The latter is modelled as rebars under initial stresses mimicking the contraction forces. The model was applied in silico to study the mechanics of infarcted left ventricle (LV) of a canine. End-systolic strain components, ejection fraction, and stress distribution attained using this LV model were compared quantitatively and qualitatively to corresponding data obtained from measurements as well as to other corresponding LV mechanics models. This comparison showed very good agreement.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2017-12-19", "authors": ["Seyyed M HHaddad", "AbbasSamani"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2017.1416355"}

{"title": "Cardiac Hypertrophy and Brain Natriuretic Peptide Levels in an Ovariectomized Rat Model Fed a High-Fat Diet.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Heart failure in women increases around the time of menopause when high-fat diets may result in obesity. The heart produces brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), also known as B-type natriuretic peptide. This aims of this study were to assess cardiac hypertrophy and BNP levels in ovariectomized rats fed a high-fat diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-eight female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sham-operated rats fed a control diet (SC) (n=12); ovariectomized rats fed a control diet (OC) (n=12); sham-operated rats fed a high-fat diet (SF) (n=12); and ovariectomized rats fed a high-fat diet (OF) (n=12). Body weight and blood pressure were measured weekly for 24 weeks. Rats were then euthanized, and plasma samples and heart tissue were studied for gene expression, hydroxyproline levels, and histological examination. RESULTS A high-fat diet and ovariectomy (group OF) increased the weight body and the systolic blood pressure after three months and five months, respectively. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was associated with increased expression of ventricular BNP, decreased natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A and increased levels of hydroxyproline and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2. The plasma levels of BNP and estradiol were inversely correlated; expression of estrogen receptor (ER)\u03b2 and ER\u03b1 were reduced. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study showed that, in the ovariectomized rats fed a high-fat diet, the BNP-NPR-A receptor complex was involved in cardiac remodeling. BNP may be a marker of cardiac hypertrophy in this animal model.", "journal": "Medical science monitor basic research", "date": "2017-12-19", "authors": ["Gleisy KellyGoncalves", "Thiago HenriqueCaldeira de Oliveira", "Najarade Oliveira Belo"], "doi": "10.12659/msmbr.907162"}

DPP-4 inhibitor has cardioprotective effects after transverse aortic constriction (TAC), but role of DPP-4 on cardiac fibrosis after TAC is not well known. Our aim was to determine the effects of DPP-4 on cardiac fibrosis in murine TAC model. Wild-type mice and DPP-4 knockout mice were subjected to TAC. Wild-type mice were then treated with vehicle or DPP-4 inhibitor. DPP-4 activities in serum and heart tissue were significantly increased at 2 weeks after TAC, but they were significantly decreased by DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. The inhibition of DPP-4 did not affect left ventricular hypertrophy, but improved cardiac function and decreased myocardial and perivascular fibrosis after TAC. The inhibition of DPP-4 decreased the collagen type III/I ratio in myocardium. These results suggest that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates the progression of heart failure after TAC by changing the quality and quantity of cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological sciences", "date": "2017-12-19", "authors": ["MasanoriHirose", "HiroyukiTakano", "HiroshiHasegawa", "HiroyukiTadokoro", "NaokoHashimoto", "GenzoTakemura", "YoshioKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jphs.2017.11.006"}
{"title": "miR-200a-5p regulates myocardial necroptosis induced by Se deficiency via targeting RNF11.", "abstract": "Necroptosis has been discovered as a new paradigm of cell death and may play a key role in heart disease and selenium (Se) deficiency. Hence, we detected the specific microRNA (miRNA) in response to Se-deficient heart using microRNAome analysis. For high-throughput sequencing using Se-deficient chicken cardiac tissue, we selected miR-200a-5p and its target gene ring finger protein 11 (RNF11) based on differential expression in cardiac tissue and confirmed the relationship between miR-200a-5p and RNF11 by dual luciferase reporter assay and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in cardiomyocytes. We further explored the function of miR-200a-5p and observed that overexpression of miR-200a-5p spark the receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIP3)-dependent necroptosis in vivo and in vitro. To understand whether miR-200a-5p and RNF11 are involved in the RIP3-dependent necroptosis pathway, we presumed that oxidative stress, inflammation response and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway might trigger necroptosis. Interestingly, necroptosis trigger, z-VAD-fmk, failed to induce necroptosis but enhanced cell survival against necrosis in cardiomyocytes with knockdown of miR-200a-5p. Our present study provides a new insight that the modulation of miR-200a-5p and its target gene might block necroptosis in the heart, revealing a novel myocardial necrosis regulation model in heart disease.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2017-12-19", "authors": ["TianshuYang", "ChangyuCao", "JieYang", "TianqiLiu", "Xin GenLei", "ZiweiZhang", "ShiwenXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.025"}
{"title": "Involvement of mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 intracellular signalling pathway in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib is used to treat cancer and is linked to severe adverse cardiovascular events. Mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is involved in the development of cardiac injury and is a component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the upstream activator of MKK7 and is specifically inhibited by 2,7-dihydro-2,7-dioxo-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (NQDI-1). This study investigates the role of ASK1, MKK7 and JNK during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Infarct size were measured in isolated male Sprague-Dawley rat Langendorff perfused hearts treated for 125\u202fmin with Sunitinib in the presence and absence of NQDI-1. Left ventricular cardiac tissue samples were analysed by qRT-PCR for MKK7 mRNA expression and cardiotoxicity associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) or Western blot analysis to measure ASK1/MKK7/JNK phosphorylation. Administration of Sunitinib (1\u202f\u03bcM) during Langendorff perfusion resulted in increased infarct size, increased miR-133a expression, and decreased phosphorylation of the ASK1/MKK7/JNK pathway compared to control. Co-administration of NQDI-1 (2.5\u202f\u03bcM) attenuated the increased Sunitinib-induced infarct size, reversed miR-133a expression and restored phosphorylated levels of ASK1/MKK7/JNK. These findings suggest that the ASK1/MKK7/JNK intracellular signalling pathway is important in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. The anti-cancer properties of Sunitinib were also assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Sunitinib significantly decreased the cell viability of human acute myeloid leukemia 60 cell line (HL60). The combination of Sunitinib (1\u202fnM-10\u202f\u03bcM) with NQDI-1 (2.5\u202f\u03bcM) enhanced the cancer-fighting properties of Sunitinib.

{"title": "PD-1 Modulates Radiation-Induced Cardiac Toxicity through Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes.", "abstract": "Combined immune checkpoint blockade has led to rare autoimmune complications, such as fatal myocarditis. Recent approvals of several anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) drugs for lung cancer treatment prompted ongoing clinical trials that directly combine PD-1 inhibitors with thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer. Overlapping toxicities from either modality have the potential to increase the risk for radiation-induced cardiotoxicity (RICT), which is well documented among patients with Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer.\nTo investigate cardiotoxicity without the compounding pulmonary toxicity from thoracic radiotherapy, we developed a technique to deliver cardiac irradiation (CIR) in a mouse model concurrently with PD-1 blockade to determine the presence of cardiac toxicity by using physiological testing and mortality as end points along with histological analysis.\nWe observed an acute mortality of 30% within 2 weeks after CIR plus anti-PD-1 antibody compared with 0% from CIR plus immunoglobulin G (p\u00a0= 0.023). Physiological testing demonstrated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.01) by echocardiogram. Tissue analyses revealed increased immune cell infiltrates within cardiac tissue. Depletion of CD8-positive lymphocytes with anti-CD8 antibody reversed the acute mortality, suggesting that the toxicity is CD8-positive cell-mediated.

Similar mortality, cardiac dysfunction, and histological changes were observed in mice receiving fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent anti-PD-1 therapy.\nThis study provides strong preclinical evidence that radiation-induced cardiotoxicity is modulated by the PD-1 axis and that PD-1 blockade should be administered with careful radiotherapy planning with an effort of reducing cardiac dose.", "journal": "Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer", "date": "2017-12-17", "authors": ["ShisuoDu", "LinZhou", "Gregory SAlexander", "KyewonPark", "LifengYang", "NadanWang", "Nicholas GZaorsky", "XinliangMa", "YajingWang", "Adam PDicker", "BoLu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtho.2017.12.002"}

Inhibitors of GSK3 have been generated as potential therapies in several diseases, however the vital role GSK3 plays in cell biology makes the clinical use of GSK3 inhibitors potentially problematic. A clearer understanding of true physiological and pathophysiological substrates of GSK3 should provide opportunities for more selective, disease specific, manipulation of GSK3. To identify kinetically favourable substrates we performed a GSK3 substrate screen in heart tissue. Rab-GTPase binding effector protein 2 (RABEP2) was identified as a novel GSK3 substrate and GSK3 phosphorylation of RABEP2 at Ser200 was enhanced by prior phosphorylation at Ser204, fitting the known consensus sequence for GSK3 substrates. Both residues are phosphorylated in cells while only Ser200 phosphorylation is reduced following inhibition of GSK3. RABEP2 function was originally identified as a Rab5 binding protein. We did not observe co-localisation of RABEP2 and Rab5 in cells, while ectopic expression of RABEP2 had no effect on endosomal recycling. The work presented identifies RABEP2 as a novel primed substrate of GSK3, and thus a potential biomarker for GSK3 activity, but understanding how phosphorylation regulates RABEP2 function requires more information on physiological roles of RABEP2.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-12-17", "authors": ["LisaLogie", "LidyVan Aalten", "AxelKnebel", "ThomasForce", "C JamesHastie", "HilaryMacLauchlan", "David GCampbell", "RobertGourlay", "AlanPrescott", "JaneDavidson", "WillFuller", "CalumSutherland"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17087-6\n10.1016/j.tibs.2003.12.004\n10.2174/1389450110607011377\n10.1038/35017574\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.013\n10.1172/JCI64398\n10.1515/rns.2011.061\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.075\n10.4049/jimmunol.1203057\n10.1007/s11064-006-9128-5\n10.1074/jbc.M112.409250\n10.1172/JCI64516\n10.1007/s10637-015-0278-7\n10.1016/0304-3940(92)90774-2\n10.1007/978-1-59745-249-6_4\n10.1042/BJ20051545\n10.1083/jcb.151.1.117\n10.1093/emboj/17.7.1930\n10.1038/nrd1415\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.004\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05194.x\n10.3389/fnmol.2011.00024\n10.1038/nature11133\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.034\n10.1038/ncb744\n10.1371/journal.pone.0156081\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.014160\n10.1186/1471-2199-5-15\n10.2337/diabetes.51.10.2903\n10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3"}

The expression of miR-181a in cardiac tissues was detected via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expressions of autophagy-related proteins, ATG5 and LC3II/LC3I, in cardiac tissues, were detected via Western blotting (WB). After the primary culture of myocardial cells in rats, they were stimulated via Angiotensin II (Ang II) to observe the effects of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and overexpression of ATG5 on the expression of hypertrophic genes in myocardial cells, respectively. The expressions of autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and LC3II/LC3I were detected via WB, the autophagic rate was observed via flow cytometry and the changes in autophagic vacuoles of myocardial cells were observed using the transmission electron microscope. The changes in mRNA and protein expressions of ATG in myocardial cells were observed after the overexpression of miR-181a or the inhibition of miR-181a activity.

After subjecting wild-type mice to experimental I/R, myocardial DIAPH1 expression was increased, an effect that was echoed following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in H9C2 and AC16 cells. Further, compared to wild-type mice, genetic deletion of Diaph1 reduced infarct size and improved contractile function after I/R.

However, the detailed pharmacological mechanism of BYD is still unknown because of its complicated chemical compositions. In this study, we synthesized a kind of solid beads with benzophenone groups on its surface. Benzophenone can be activated and chemically cross-linked with the C-H bonds of the chemical compositions in BYD (BYD beads) under UV activation. We thus captured all the target proteins from mouse heart tissue lysates by using BYD beads. Based on proteomics analysis, we discovered totally 46 potential binding target proteins, most of which were located in mitochondria. KEGG analysis revealed that these target proteins were mainly associated with TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism signaling pathways, suggesting that the cardioprotection of BYD might be associated with regulating mitochondrial function and energy production. Moreover, JC-1 staining analysis also confirmed the protective effect of BYD on mitochondrial damage. In summary, our findings elucidated the potential mechanism of BYD on cardioprotection through \"target fishing\" strategy, and further explained its traditional efficacy in the molecular level.

The impact of ischemia on mitochondrial function has been extensively studied in the heart because of the morbidity and mortality associated with injury to this organ. As conventional methods to preserve cardiac cell viability and contractile function following ischemia are limited in their efficacy, we developed a unique approach to protect the heart by transplanting respiration-competent mitochondria to the injured region. Our previous animal experiments showed that transplantation of isolated mitochondria to ischemic heart tissue leads to decreases in cell death, increases in energy production, and improvements in contractile function. We also discovered that exogenously-derived mitochondria injected or perfused into ischemic hearts were rapidly internalised by cardiac cells. Here, we used three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to determine the intracellular fate of endocytosed exogenous mitochondria in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and primary cardiac fibroblasts. We found isolated mitochondria are incorporated into cardiac cells within minutes and then transported to endosomes and lysosomes.

In this study, In Situ Hybridization(ISH), RT-PCR, cell transfection, western blotting and laser confocal telescope were used, respectively. ISH showed that miR-21, concentrated in cytoplasmic foci in the proximity of the nucleus, was mainly localized in cardiac fibroblasts and at relatively low levels in cardiomyocytes within cardiac tissue with DN.

{"title": "Accelerated decline in cardiac stem cell efficiency in Spontaneously hypertensive rat compared to normotensive Wistar rat.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiac failure. Efficient management of hypertensive heart disease requires identification of factors that can possibly mediate the transition from hypertrophy to failure. Resident cardiac stem cells have a prominent role in the maintenance of cardiac tissue homeostasis. Decline in the proportion of healthy cardiac stem cells (CSCs) can affect tissue regeneration. In pathological conditions, apart from natural aging, an adverse microenvironment can lead to decrease in efficiency of CSCs. A systematic analysis of cardiac stem cell characteristics in pathological conditions has not been reported so far. Therefore, this study was designed with the objective of examining the age associated variation in stem cell attributes of Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in comparison with normotensive Wistar rat. Spontaneously hypertensive rat was used as the experimental model since the cardiac remodeling resembles the clinical course of hypertensive heart disease. CSCs were isolated from atrial explants. Stem cell attributes were assessed in 1-week, 6, 12 and 18-month-old male SHR, in comparison with age matched Wistar rats. In 1-week-old pups, stem cell attributes of SHR and Wistar were comparable. Migration potential, proliferative capacity, TERT expression, telomerase activity and the proportion of c-kit+ cells decreased with age, both in SHR and Wistar. DNA damage and the proportion of senescent CSCs increased with age both in SHR and Wistar rats. Age associated increase was observed in the oxidative stress of stem cells, possibly mediated by the enhanced oxidative stress in the microenvironment. The changes were more pronounced in SHR, and as early as six months of age, there was significant decrease in efficiency of CSCs of SHR compared to Wistar. The density of healthy CSCs determined as a fraction of the differentiated cells was remarkably low in 18-month-old SHR. Age associated decrease in functionally efficient CSCs was therefore accelerated in SHR. Considering the vital role of CSCs in the maintenance of a healthy myocardium, decrease in functionally efficient CSCs can be a precipitating factor in pathological cardiac remodeling. Elevated ROS levels in CSCs of SHR lends scope for speculation that decrease in efficiency of CSCs is mediated by oxidative stress; and that modulation of the microenvironment by therapeutic interventions can restore a healthy stem cell population and facilitate maintenance of cardiac homeostasis and prevent cardiac decompensation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-12-13", "authors": ["SherinSaheera", "Renuka RNair"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189129\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328333146d\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1093/cvr/cvq005\n10.1038/nm.3651\n10.1038/sj.embor.7400436\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.03.036\n10.1038/srep22781\n10.3390/ijms15046002\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000153800.09920.40\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01826-5\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.01.049\n10.1155/2013/474931\n10.1089/ars.2008.2118\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00076-5\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.07.061\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.1.161\n10.1007/s11010-011-0711-y\n10.1161/01.RES.0000117306.10142.50\n10.1089/scd.2013.0388\n10.4238/2015.January.23.7\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.011\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00983-9\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.09.001\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.05.010\n10.1111/jch.12282\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.001\n10.1007/s12185-011-0872-1\n10.1038/nature07733\n10.1002/stem.438\n10.1002/stem.441\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.1435\n10.1242/dev.107086\n10.1038/stemcells.2007.55\n10.1002/dvdy.22650\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.09.086\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.07.042\n10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.007\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603671\n10.1073/pnas.0500169102"}

Cardiotoxicity is determined by cardiac exposure to anthracyclines and to more toxic secondary alcohol metabolites that are formed inside cardiomyocytes or diffuse from the bloodstream. Concerns exist that HF might be caused by cumulative anthracycline doses that were thought to be safe. Patients with gain-of-function polymorphism of carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3), which converts anthracyclines to secondary alcohol metabolites, would be at a higher risk of HF. Recently, a pharmacokinetic model was developed that simulated clinical exposure of human myocardium to anthracyclines and incorporated simulations of CBR3 polymorphism. It was shown that HF risk could occur after lower doxorubicin doses than previously reported, particularly for patients with CBR3 polymorphism. In this study, we show that also daunorubicin and idarubicin, but not epirubicin, might cause HF after reportedly safe cumulative doses. CBR3 polymorphism increased HF risk from daunorubicin and idarubicin to a greater extent as compared with doxorubicin. This was caused by daunorubicin and idarubicin forming higher levels of toxic metabolites in human myocardium; moreover, daunorubicin and idarubicin metabolites diffused from plasma and accumulated in cardiac tissue, whereas doxorubicin metabolite did not. CBR3 polymorphism did not aggravate HF risk from epirubicin, which was caused by the very low levels of formation of its toxic metabolite.

Cardiac injury involves the release of various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including heparan sulfate (HS), a constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM), through the TLR4 receptor activation triggering a strong inflammatory response, inducing leukocytes recruitment. This latter cells are responsible of clearing cell debris and releasing cytokines that promote CF differentiation to myofibroblast (CMF), thus initiating scar formation. CF were isolated from adult male rats and subsequently stimulated with HS or LPS, in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitors, to evaluate signaling pathways involved in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were used to evaluate participation of these adhesion molecules on leukocytes recruitment. HS through TLR4, PI3K/AKT and NF-\u039aB increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, which favored the adhesion of spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) and bone marrow granulocytes (PMN) to CF. These effects were prevented by siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.

{"title": "MiRroring the Multiple Potentials of MicroRNAs in Acute Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "At present, cardiovascular diseases are depicted to be the leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization. In the future, projections predict that ischemic heart disease will persist in the top main causes of illness. Within this alarming context, some tiny master regulators of gene expression programs, namely, microRNAs (miRNAs) carry three promising potentials. In fact, miRNAs can prove to be useful not only in terms of biomarkers allowing heart injury detection but also in terms of therapeutics to overcome limitations of past strategies and treat the lesions. In a more creative approach, they can even be used in the area of human engineered cardiac tissues as maturation tools for cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from pluripotent stem cell. Very promising not only for patient-specific cell-based therapies but also to develop biomimetic microsystems for disease modeling and drug screening, these cells greatly contribute to personalized medicine. To get into the heart of the matter, the focus of this review lies primarily on miRNAs as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) biomarkers. Only large cohort studies comprising over 100 individuals to reach a potent statistical value were considered. Certain miRNAs appeared to possibly complement protein-based biomarkers and classical risk factors. Some were even described to bear potential in the discrimination of similar symptomatic pathologies. However, differences between pre-analytical and analytical approaches substantially influenced miRNA data. Further supported by meta-analysis studies, this problem had to be addressed. A detailed critical analysis of each step to define miRNAs biomarker potential is provided to inspire a future improved universal strategy. Interestingly, a recurrent set of cardiomyocyte-enriched miRNAs was found, namely, miR-1; miR-133; miR-208a/b; and miR-499a. Each member of this myomiRs group displayed promising roles either individually or in combination as AMI diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, a precise combo was shown to be powerful enough to transdifferentiate human fibroblasts into CMs opening doors in the therapeutics. Following these discoveries, they also emerged as optional tools to transfect in order to mature CMs derived from pluripotent stem cells. Ultimately, the multiple potentials carried by the myomiRs miR-1; miR-133; miR-208a/b; and miR-499a still remain to be fully unveiled.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2017-12-07", "authors": ["SolennePaiva", "OnnikAgbulut"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2017.00073\n10.1016/j.gheart.2014.03.1220\n10.1038/nrm3619\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223024\n10.1016/j.gheart.2012.08.001\n10.1056/NEJMra1105239\n10.3122/jabfm.2015.02.140189\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.04.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026573\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000266\n10.2217/14622416.10.3.399\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.001\n10.3390/cells3040996\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.10.005\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.03.013\n10.1101/gad.1706508\n10.1261/rna.053264.115\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.200451\n10.1073/pnas.0710228105\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.23.090506.123406\n10.1038/srep19884\n10.1067/mcp.2001.113989\n10.21037/atm.2016.05.19\n10.1093/bja/aeh148\n10.1056/NEJMoa0903515\n10.1056/NEJMoa0900428\n10.3310/hta19440\n10.2147/VHRM.S24509\n10.1515/cclm-2013-0074\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.147405\n10.1073/pnas.1019055108\n10.1038/ncb2210\n10.1093/hmg/dds317\n10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00809-6\n10.3978/j.issn.2223-3652.2014.12.03\n10.1373/clinchem.2010.144121\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-305402\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.005\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.07.011\n10.6061/clinics/2013(01)OA12\n10.1186/1471-2261-13-12\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.01.075\n10.1186/1755-8794-6-16\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu151\n10.1007/s00395-010-0123-2\n10.1373/clinchem.2011.181370\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.03.056\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.068\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104618\n10.7754/Clin.Lab.2015.151023\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-0568\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088566\n10.1373/clinchem.2011.173823\n10.1097/MD.0000000000007173\n10.7754/Clin.Lab.2016.160632\n10.1373/clinchem.2012.199505\n10.1186/s12920-015-0082-4\n10.4061/2011/532915\n10.1159/000328869\n10.1146/annurev.med.59.053006.104707\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.012237\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003694\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041561\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0565\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.07.031\n10.1186/1471-2164-15-395\n10.1111/jcmm.12236\n10.1146/annurev-anchem-071114-040343\n10.1186/1471-2105-15-29\n10.1039/c1mb05353a\n10.1093/jnci/51.5.1705\n10.1373/clinchem.2003.026013\n10.1038/nmeth.3014\n10.1160/TH12-02-0097\n10.1515/cclm-2016-1162\n10.1515/cclm-2016-0471\n10.1126/science.8140423\n10.1038/35070587\n10.1155/2015/613782\n10.1002/14651858.CD006536.pub4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.04.011\n10.1016/j.jss.2007.03.021\n10.1016/S1096-7192(02)00004-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvr099\n10.3727/096368912X658836\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.12.074\n10.1093/cvr/cvt149\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.035\n10.1016/j.healun.2014.10.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1083/jcb.201211138\n10.1016/j.healun.2016.01.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227496\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-011613-135957\n10.1016/j.tcm.2016.02.004\n10.1261/rna.2414110\n10.1038/nrd.2016.246\n10.1056/NEJMoa1209026\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.06.013\n10.15252/emmm.201100899\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269035\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.029\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.030\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00932.2006\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.10.013\n10.1089/dna.2012.1787\n10.1007/s00216-008-2215-5\n10.1021/ac702577a\n10.1261/rna.2225110\n10.1038/nnano.2011.147\n10.1155/2015/187384\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.641936\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2006.10.014\n10.2337/dc13-1852\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.06.006\n10.1007/s10654-014-9952-x\n10.1093/qjmed/91.10.667\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.699579\n10.1161/hc0302.102575\n10.1016/S0195-668X(03)00114-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303549\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303836"}

{"title": "Geraniin protects bone marrow\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cells against hydrogen peroxide\u2011induced cellular oxidative stress in vitro.", "abstract": "Administration of bone marrow\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of myocardial infarction\u00a0(MI). However, the increase in reactive oxygen species\u00a0(ROS) in ischemic cardiac tissue compromises the survival of transplanted MSCs, thus resulting in limited therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, strategies that attenuate oxidative stress\u2011induced damage and enhance MSC viability are required. Geraniin has been reported to possess potent antioxidative activity and exert protective effects on numerous cell types under certain conditions. Therefore, geraniin may be considered a potential drug used to modulate MSC\u2011based therapy for MI. In the present study, MSCs were pretreated with geraniin for 24\u00a0h and were exposed to hydrogen peroxide\u00a0(H2O2) for 4\u00a0h. Cell apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using Annexin\u00a0V\u2011fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, the 2',7'\u2011dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescent probe and the membrane permeable dye JC\u20111, respectively. Glutathione and malondialdehyde levels were also investigated. The expression levels of apoptosis\u2011associated proteins and proteins of the phosphoinositide 3\u2011kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway were analyzed by western blotting. The results demonstrated that geraniin could significantly attenuate H2O2\u2011induced cell damage by promoting MSC survival, reducing cellular ROS production and maintaining mitochondrial function. Furthermore, geraniin modulated the expression levels of phosphorylated\u2011Akt in a time\u2011 and dose\u2011dependent manner. The cytoprotective effects of geraniin were suppressed by LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor. In conclusion, the present study revealed that geraniin protects MSCs from H2O2\u2011induced oxidative stress injury via the PI3K/Akt pathway.

This capacity for complete cardiac repair provides a template for understanding the process of regeneration and for developing strategies to improve human cardiac repair outcomes. Using a cardiac cryo-injury model we show that heart regeneration is dependent on the innate immune system, as macrophage depletion during early time points post-injury results in regeneration failure. In contrast to the transient extracellular matrix (ECM) that normally accompanies regeneration, this intervention resulted in a permanent, highly cross-linked extracellular matrix scar derived from alternative fibroblast activation and lysyl-oxidase enzyme synthesis. The activation of cardiomyocyte proliferation was not affected by macrophage depletion, indicating that cardiomyocyte replacement is an independent feature of the regenerative process, and is not sufficient to prevent fibrotic progression. These findings highlight the interplay between macrophages and fibroblasts as an important component of cardiac regeneration, and the prevention of fibrosis as a key therapeutic target in the promotion of cardiac repair in mammals.", "journal": "NPJ Regenerative medicine", "date": "2017-12-05", "authors": ["J WGodwin", "RDebuque", "ESalimova", "N ARosenthal"], "doi": "10.1038/s41536-017-0027-y\n10.1038/248145a0\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1089/clo.2004.6.345\n10.1007/s12272-016-0809-6\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305381\n10.1152/ajpheart.00111.2005\n10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.08.008\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.1073/pnas.1300290110\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.007\n10.1242/dev.060897\n10.1007/s00429-002-0249-6\n10.1186/1471-213X-11-21\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.002\n10.1007/978-1-4939-2495-0_17\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.004\n10.1038/mt.2015.66\n10.1590/S0066-782X2009000200013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0080477\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0071\n10.1111/micc.12259\n10.1016/j.vph.2012.08.001\n10.1017/S1462399411001967\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.158\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.038\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.019\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.031\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80003-9\n10.1002/dvdy.20095\n10.1038/jid.2012.252\n10.1074/jbc.M301370200\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.09.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.040\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.08.002\n10.1016/j.biocel.2014.10.011\n10.1242/dmm.012062\n10.1016/j.biocel.2007.10.024\n10.1016/j.diff.2013.03.003\n10.1038/emboj.2011.418\n10.1002/iub.594\n10.1046/j.1524-475X.1996.40217.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001227\n10.1042/CS20120619\n10.1186/1755-1536-6-20\n10.1038/hr.2012.92\n10.1038/nm.2208\n10.1093/cvr/cvv214\n10.1242/jcs.01188\n10.1016/j.gde.2016.05.029\n10.1155/2016/6193419\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.09.003"}

{"title": "Control of electrical turbulence by periodic excitation of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Electrical turbulence in cardiac tissue is associated with arrhythmias such as life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. Recent experimental studies have shown that a sequence of low-energy electrical far-field pulses is able to terminate fibrillation more gently than a single high-energy pulse which causes severe side effects. During this low-energy antifibrillation pacing (LEAP), only tissue near sufficiently large conduction heterogeneities, such as large coronary arteries, is activated. In order to optimize LEAP, we performed extensive simulations of cardiac tissue perforated by blood vessels, employing two alternative cellular models that exhibit electrical turbulence at a similar length scale. Moreover, the scale of blood vessels in our two-dimensional simulations was chosen such that the threshold for single pulse defibrillation matches experimental values. For each of the 100 initial conditions, we tested different electrical field strengths, pulse shapes, numbers of pulses, and periods between the pulses. LEAP is successful for both models, albeit with substantial differences. One model exhibits a spectrum of chaotic activity featuring a narrow peak around a dominant frequency. In this case, the optimal period between low-energy pulses matches this frequency and LEAP greatly reduces the required energy for successful defibrillation. For pulses with larger energies, the system is perturbed such that underdrive pacing becomes advantageous. The spectrum of the second model features a broader peak, resulting in a less pronounced optimal pacing period and a decreased energy reduction. In both cases, pacing with five or six pulses which are separated by the dominant period maximizes the energy reduction.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2017-12-03", "authors": ["PavelBuran", "MarkusB\u00e4r", "SergioAlonso", "ThomasNiedermayer"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5010787"}

{"title": "Preconditioned augmented Lagrangian formulation for nearly incompressible cardiac mechanics.", "abstract": "Computational modeling of the heart is a subject of substantial medical and scientific interest, which may contribute to increase the understanding of several phenomena associated with cardiac physiological and pathological states. Modeling the mechanics of the heart have led to considerable insights, but it still represents a complex and a demanding computational problem, especially in a strongly coupled electromechanical setting. Passive cardiac tissue is commonly modeled as hyperelastic and is characterized by quasi-incompressible, orthotropic, and nonlinear material behavior. These factors are known to be very challenging for the numerical solution of the model. The near-incompressibility is known to cause numerical issues such as the well-known locking phenomenon and ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix. In this work, the augmented Lagrangian method is used to handle the nearly incompressible condition. This approach can potentially improve computational performance by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix and thereby improving the convergence of iterative solvers. We also improve the performance of iterative solvers by the use of an algebraic multigrid preconditioner. Numerical results of the augmented Lagrangian method combined with a preconditioned iterative solver for a cardiac mechanics benchmark suite are presented to show its improved performance.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": ["Joventino OliveiraCampos", "Rodrigo WeberDos Santos", "JoakimSundnes", "Bernardo MartinsRocha"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.2948"}

{"title": "AT1 receptor blockage impairs NF-\u03baB activation mediated by thyroid hormone in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that calcium-binding protein S100A8 and myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) are important mediators of nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) activation in cardiomyocytes and that signalling molecules are involved in the hypertrophic response that is stimulated by thyroid hormones (TH). Angiotensin II (Ang II), the main active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), binds to type 1 Ang II receptor (AT1R) and subsequently promotes cardiac hypertrophy and the inflammatory response with NF-\u03baB activation underlying the cardiovascular effects. Considering the amount of evidence that RAS is an important mediator of TH actions on the cardiovascular system, we aimed to investigate whether cardiac expression of NF-\u03baB and upstream associated molecules could be altered in hyperthyroidism, as well as whether AT1R could mediate the effects of TH on cardiac tissue and in cardiomyocytes in culture. Wistar rats were subjected to hyperthyroidism with or without the AT1R blocker losartan. The TH serum levels, haemodynamic parameters and cardiac mass were assessed to confirm the hyperthyroid status. The S100A8, MyD88 and nuclear NF-\u03baB expression levels were increased in the hearts of the hyperthyroid rats, and the losartan treatment attenuated these TH effects. In addition, the cultured cardiomyocytes that had been stimulated with losartan exhibited blunted S100A8 upregulation and NF-\u03baB activation compared with the TH-treated cells. Together, our results suggest that AT1R participates in TH-induced cardiac hypertrophy partly by mediating S100A8, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB activation via TH. These findings indicate the important crosstalk between TH and RAS, highlighting the participation of AT1R in the triggered mechanisms of TH that contribute to the cardiac hypertrophy response.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2017-11-28", "authors": ["Ana Paula CremascoTakano", "NathaliaSenger", "Carolina DemarchiMunhoz", "Maria Luiza MoraisBarreto-Chaves"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-017-2088-6"}
{"title": "Effect of single and repeated heat stress on chemical signals of heat shock response cascade in the rat's heart.", "abstract": "Exposure to sublethal heat stress activates a complex cascade of signaling events, such as activators (NO), signal molecules (PKC\u03b5), and mediators (HSP70 and COX-2), leading to implementation of heat preconditioning, an adaptive mechanism which makes the organism more tolerant to additional stress. We investigated the time frame in which these chemical signals are triggered after heat stress (41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0\u0421/45\u00a0min), single or repeated (24 or 72\u00a0h after the first one) in heart tissue of male Wistar rats. The animals were allowed to recover 24, 48 or 72\u00a0h at room temperature. Single heat stress caused a significant increase of the concentration of HSP70, NO, and PKC level and decrease of COX-2 level 24\u00a0h after the heat stress, which in the next course of recovery gradually normalized. The second heat stress, 24\u00a0h after the first one, caused a significant reduction of the HSP70 levels, concentration of NO and PKC\u025b, and significant increase of COX-2 concentration. The second exposure, 72\u00a0h after the first heat stress, caused more expressive changes of HSP70 and NO in the 24\u00a0h-recovery groups. The level of PKC\u025b was not significantly changed, but there was significantly increased COX-2 concentration during recovery. Serum activity of AST, ALT, and CK was reduced after single exposure and increased after repeated exposure to heat stress, in both time intervals. In conclusion, a longer period of recovery (72\u00a0h) between two consecutive sessions of heat stress is necessary to achieve more expressive changes in mediators (HSP70) and triggers (NO) of heat preconditioning.", "journal": "Cell stress & chaperones", "date": "2017-11-28", "authors": ["GordanaIlievska", "SuzanaDinevska-Kjovkarovska", "BiljanaMiova"], "doi": "10.1007/s12192-017-0863-0\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0703942\n10.1161/01.RES.87.11.972\n10.1007/s003950050101\n10.1002/iub.31\n10.1080/10715760410001702503\n10.3892/mmr.2012.982\n10.1152/jappl.1978.45.1.1\n10.1016/S0079-6123(06)62018-9\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00306.2004\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02001-6\n10.1136/thx.2008.101139\n10.3109/02656736.2013.777853\n10.1111/j.1472-8206.1999.tb00314.x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.08.012\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01267.2001\n10.1016/0014-5793(95)00801-F\n10.1002/jcb.25187\n10.1152/jappl.1997.83.5.1413\n10.1161/01.RES.84.5.587\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0680\n10.1073/pnas.90.15.7240\n10.1073/pnas.97.18.10197\n10.1080/02656730110064342\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.14.1414\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.02.004"}

Five parameters were estimated. The model was fitted to amitriptyline and nortriptyline concentrations after an intravenous infusion of amitriptyline. The cardiac model consisted of 5 compartments representing the pericardial fluid, heart extracellular water, and epicardial intracellular, midmyocardial intracellular, and endocardial intracellular fluids. Drug cardiac metabolism, passive diffusion, active efflux, and uptake were included in the model as mechanisms involved in the drug disposition within the heart. The model accounted for inter-individual variability. The estimates of optimized parameters were within physiological ranges. The model performance was verified by simulating 5 clinical studies of amitriptyline intravenous infusion, and the simulated pharmacokinetic profiles agreed with clinical data.

Embryonic endocardial cells (ECCs) were assigned into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), miR-34a mimics, miR-34a inhibitors, miR-34a inhibitors+siRNA-NOTCH-1, siRNA-NOTCH-1, miR-34a mimics+NOTCH-1 OE and miR-34a mimics+crispr/cas9 (mutant NOTCH-1) groups. The expressions of miR-34a, NOTCH-1, Jagged1, Hes1, Hey2 and Csx in cardiac tissues and ECCs were determined by both RT-qPCR and western blotting methods. MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted for cell proliferation and apoptosis measurement. A dual luciferase reporter assay was applied to demonstrate that NOTCH-1 was the target gene of miR-34a. In comparison to the normal group, the expressions of miR-34a, Jagged1, Hes1 and Hey2 displayed up-regulated levels, while the expressions of NOTCH-1 and Csx were down-regulated in the CHD group. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the miR-34a mimics and siRNA-NOTCH-1 groups displayed reduced expressions of NOTCH-1 and Csx as well as a decreased proliferation rate, higher miR-34a, Jagged1, Hes1 and Hey2 expressions and an increased rate of apoptosis; while an reverse trend was observed in the miR-34a inhibitors group.

This study aims to investigate the protective effect of simvastatin on myocardial injury caused by diabetic hypoglycemia and the possible underlying mechanism.\nWe used streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 55\u2009mg/kg to induce diabetes mellitus (DM) and over-dose insulin to induce hypoglycemia to establish diabetic hypoglycemia rat models. The cardiac protective effect of simvastatin treatment (at a dose of 40\u2009mg/kg\u00b7d) upon diabetic hypoglycemia models was assessed. Ex vivo cardiac function, cardiomyocyte inotropic property and calcium transient were evaluated. The expression levels of microRNA (miRNA) and NF-\u03baB in heart tissues were investigated.\nBoth systolic and diastolic functions in diabetic rats were weakened, and further worsened in diabetic hypoglycemia rats, partially restored after administration of simvastatin. The protective effect of simvastatin on cardiac function under diabetic hypoglycermia was associated with decreased intracellular calcium and increased calcium sensitivity. miRNA array showed a differential profile of miRNA expression existed in diabetic hypoglycemia rats compared with diabetic non-hypoglycemia group, and that simvastatin could reverse the altered miRNA expression in diabetic hypoglycemia group.\nSimvastatin has protective effect on myocardial injury caused by diabetes with hypoglycemia, which is associated with increased calcium sensitivity, decreased NF-\u03baB expression and altered miRNA expression profile.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association", "date": "2017-11-23", "authors": ["HaiqingLi", "QianqianZhao", "RongLiu", "LanYang", "HuanzhenChen", "XiangliCui"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0043-110481"}

Radiation, a common component of treatment, can cause acute damage to critical organs including the lungs and the heart, but the serious toxicities from radiotherapy alone is relatively rare. A recent addition to the treatment regimen is immunotherapy, such as anti-PD-1 antibody, which blocks the inhibition of activated T cells. Combining anti-PD-1 treatment and thoracic radiation has potential for improving the outcomes of locally advanced lung cancer over traditional chemoradiation regimens, but the effect of combining these therapies on non-malignant lung tissue has not yet been investigated in preclinical models.\n6\u20138 week old C57Bl/6 mice were treated with either anti-PD-1 antibody or control IgG with or without thoracic radiation (20Gy), and survival was monitored as an end point to determine any potential increase of toxicity from the combination therapy. Immune cell infiltration into the irradiated cardiac and lung tissues was analyzed via flow cytometry and histologically.\nAt 21 days post-radiation, 70% of animals in the IgG + radiation group survived, significantly more than the anti-PD-1 + radiation group (36%; p=0.0169). T cell counts were significantly elevated in both cardiac and pulmonary tissues after combination therapy as compared to anti-PD-1 antibody alone (heart: 6.1 vs 22.4, p<0.001; lung 3.4 vs 20.8, p<0.001) or control IgG plus radiation (heart 11.3 vs 22.4, p<0.05; lung 12.2 vs 20.8, p<0.05) in flow cytometric studies.

Therefore, there remains an unmet need for therapies that can aid in attenuating cardiac damage.

These exosomes/nanoshuttles, once thought to be merely a method of waste disposal, have been shown to play a crucial role in physiological functions including short- and long-distance intercellular communication. In this review, we have summarized studies demonstrating the potential role of exosomes in improving cardiac function, attenuating cardiac fibrosis, stimulating angiogenesis, and modulating miRNA expression. Furthermore, exosomes carry an important cargo of miRNAs and proteins that could play an important role as a diagnostic marker for cardiovascular disease post-myocardial infarction.

{"title": "Vitiligo and Autoimmune Thyroid Disorders.", "abstract": "Vitiligo represents the most common cause of acquired skin, hair, and oral depigmentation, affecting 0.5-1% of the population worldwide. It is clinically characterized by the appearance of disfiguring circumscribed skin macules following melanocyte destruction by autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Patients affected by vitiligo usually show a poorer quality of life and are more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms, particularly evident in dark-skinned individuals. Although vitiligo is a non-fatal disease, exposure of affected skin to UV light increases the chance of skin irritation and predisposes to skin cancer. In addition, vitiligo has been associated with other rare systemic disorders due to the presence of melanocytes in other body districts, such as in eyes, auditory, nervous, and cardiac tissues, where melanocytes are thought to have roles different from that played in the skin. Several pathogenetic models have been proposed to explain vitiligo onset and progression, but clinical and experimental findings point mainly to the autoimmune hypothesis as the most qualified one. In this context, it is of relevance the strong association of vitiligo with other autoimmune diseases, in particular with autoimmune thyroid disorders, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves' disease. In this review, after a brief overview of vitiligo and its pathogenesis, we will describe the clinical association between vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disorders and discuss the possible underlying molecular mechanism(s).", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "date": "2017-11-23", "authors": ["EnkeBaldini", "TeresaOdorisio", "SalvatoreSorrenti", "AntonioCatania", "FrancescoTartaglia", "GiovanniCarbotta", "DanielePironi", "RobertaRendina", "EleonoraD'Armiento", "SeverinoPersechino", "SalvatoreUlisse"], "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2017.00290\n10.1111/j.1755-148X.2012.00997.x\n10.1016/j.jaad.2010.08.031\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60763-7\n10.1001/archderm.1977.01640010049006\n10.1111/ijd.13198\n10.4103/0019-5154.39745\n10.1111/bjd.15199\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.095\n10.1016/j.jaad.2016.10.048\n10.1111/j.1468-3083.2006.02106.x\n10.1016/j.coi.2016.09.008\n10.1155/2015/631927\n10.1056/NEJMcp0804388\n10.1159/000131485\n10.12688/f1000research.8976.1\n10.1038/jid.2015.92\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2015.09.003\n10.4103/0378-6323.48427\n10.1111/jcmm.12874\n10.1038/jid.2014.152\n10.1016/j.jid.2017.01.020\n10.1111/1523-1747.ep12480976\n10.1242/jcs.153643\n10.1038/jid.2012.181\n10.1086/430279\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000523\n10.1038/jid.2010.337\n10.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.011\n10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00032.x\n10.1111/1523-1747.ep12492607\n10.1111/j.1600-0560.1984.tb00361.x\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00411.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2249.1998.00746.x\n10.1172/JCI0214643\n10.1084/jem.188.6.1203\n10.1016/j.autrev.2017.07.006\n10.2340/00015555-2080\n10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2015.03.02\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007811\n10.1038/jid.2011.463\n10.1177/039463201002300424\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018907\n10.1111/j.1755-148X.2011.00945.x\n10.1016/j.autrev.2014.10.002\n10.1096/fj.10-162156\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00425.x\n10.1111/jcmm.12411\n10.1016/j.autrev.2013.07.006\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.1968.tb12282.x\n10.1111/1346-8138.12147\n10.1016/j.jaad.2015.08.063\n10.1111/j.1600-0749.2005.00242.x\n10.1111/j.1365-4362.1996.tb01610.x\n10.1111/j.1525-1470.1996.tb00703.x\n10.1159/000354607\n10.1684/ejd.2009.0939\n10.2332/allergolint.11-OA-0303\n10.1016/j.jaad.2010.08.032\n10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.3049\n10.1006/jaut.1995.0009\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.1970.tb12428.x\n10.1001/archderm.1970.04000010084015\n10.1016/j.autrev.2016.09.009\n10.1530/EJE-16-0737\n10.1155/2015/435947\n10.3923/pjbs.2013.570.574\n10.1111/bjd.13286\n10.1155/2016/8065765\n10.1016/j.jaad.2016.12.034\n10.1155/2015/192736\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.11198.x\n10.1007/s00244-015-0138-7\n10.1016/j.ejim.2007.09.021\n10.1016/j.jaad.2016.04.029\n10.5114/pdia.2014.43497\n10.1055/s-0029-1214415\n10.1089/thy.2010.1643\n10.1038/ng.2272\n10.1038/nrendo.2013.56\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004123\n10.3109/08916934.2013.768617\n10.1093/hmg/11.6.661\n10.1086/375451\n10.1086/381134\n10.1210/jc.2015-2126\n10.1007/s00403-016-1641-z\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19617.x\n10.1038/jid.2009.180"}

The stiffness of the SP patches, quantified by their Young's moduli and elasticities, increased with the crystallinity of the SF. During 3\u00a0days of proliferation, hBMSC migrated and morphologically transformed into 3D microtissues with diameters of approximately 150-200\u00a0\u03bcm on low-stiffness SP20 and SP30 patches, whereas 2D monolayers were observed on the SP37 and SP44 patches.

To this end, we have developed a system to characterize our bioartificial heart model and compare them to functional native structures. In the present study, the hearts of adult Sprague-Dawley were decellularized resulting in a natural three-dimensional cardiac scaffold. Neonatal rat primary cardiac cells were then cultured within a complex 3D fibrin gel, forming a 3-dimensional cardiac construct, which was sutured to the acellular scaffold and suspended in media for 24-48\u00a0h. The resulting bioartificial hearts (BAHs) were then affixed with 16 electrodes, in different configurations to evaluate not only the electrocardiographic characteristics of the cultured tissues, but to also test the system's consistency. Histological evaluation showed cellularization and cardiac tissue formation. The BAHs and native hearts were then evaluated with our 16-channel flexible system to acquire the metrics associated with their respective electrophysiological properties. Time delays between the native signals were in the range of 0-95\u00a0ms. As well, color maps revealed a trend in impulse propagation throughout the native hearts.

{"title": "The Multifaceted Roles of DJ-1 as an Antioxidant.", "abstract": "The DJ-1 protein was originally linked with Parkinson's disease and is now known to have antioxidant functions. The protein has three redox-sensitive cysteine residues, which are involved in its dimerisation and functional properties. A mildly oxidised form of DJ-1 is the most active form and protects cells from oxidative stress conditions. DJ-1 functions as an antioxidant through a variety of mechanisms, including a weak direct antioxidant activity by scavenging reactive oxygen species. DJ-1 also regulates a number of signalling pathways, including the inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-induced apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions. Other proteins regulated by DJ-1 include enzymes, chaperones, the 20S proteasome and transcription factors, including Nrf2. Once activated by oxidative stress, Nrf2 upregulates antioxidant gene expression including members of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways, which in turn mediate an antioxidant protective function. Crosstalk between DJ-1 and both the thioredoxin and glutathione systems has also been identified. Thioredoxin reduces a cysteine residue on DJ-1 to modulate its activity, while glutaredoxin1 de-glutathionylates DJ-1, preventing degradation of DJ-1 and resulting in its accumulation. DJ-1 also regulates the activity of glutamate cysteine ligase, which is the rate-limiting step for glutathione synthesis. These antioxidant functions of DJ-1 are key to its role in protecting neurons from oxidative stress and are hypothesised to protect the brain from the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD)\u00a0and to protect cardiac tissues from ischaemic-reperfusion injury. However, DJ-1, as an antioxidant, also protects cancer cells from undergoing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2017-11-18", "authors": ["Prahlad VRaninga", "GiovannaDi Trapani", "Kathryn FTonissen"], "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-6583-5_6"}

{"title": "Estimating the probabilities of rare arrhythmic events in multiscale computational models of cardiac cells and tissue.", "abstract": "Ectopic heartbeats can trigger reentrant arrhythmias, leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Such events have been attributed to perturbed Ca2+ handling in cardiac myocytes leading to spontaneous Ca2+ release and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). However, the ways in which perturbation of specific molecular mechanisms alters the probability of ectopic beats is not understood. We present a multiscale model of cardiac tissue incorporating a biophysically detailed three-dimensional model of the ventricular myocyte. This model reproduces realistic Ca2+ waves and DADs driven by stochastic Ca2+ release channel (RyR) gating and is used to study mechanisms of DAD variability. In agreement with previous experimental and modeling studies, key factors influencing the distribution of DAD amplitude and timing include cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations, inwardly rectifying potassium current (IK1) density, and gap junction conductance. The cardiac tissue model is used to investigate how random RyR gating gives rise to probabilistic triggered activity in a one-dimensional myocyte tissue model. A novel spatial-average filtering method for estimating the probability of extreme (i.e. rare, high-amplitude) stochastic events from a limited set of spontaneous Ca2+ release profiles is presented.

We hypothesized that GA controls hypertension via oxidative stress response regulation in an animal model for essential hypertension. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were administered GA for 16 weeks. GA treatment lowered elevated systolic blood pressure in SHRs through the inhibition of vascular contractility and components of the renin-angiotensin II system. In addition, GA administration reduced aortic wall thickness and body weight in SHRs. In SHRs, GA attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced the expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors. NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and GATA4 mRNA expression was induced in SHR hearts and angiotensin II-treated H9c2 cells; this expression was downregulated by GA treatment. Nox2 promoter activity was increased by the synergistic action of GATA4 and Nkx2-5. GA seems to regulate oxidative stress by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of GATA4 in the rat Nox2 promoter. GA reduced the GATA4-induced Nox activity in SHRs and angiotensin II-treated H9c2 cells. GA administration reduced the elevation of malondialdehyde levels in heart tissue obtained from SHRs.

Matrine treatment has proven to be effective in cases of organ fibrosis and cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, the anti-fibrosis-associated cardioprotective effects of matrine on DbCM were investigated. Rats with experimental DbCM were administered matrine orally. Cardiac functions were evaluated using invasive hemodynamic examinations. Cardiac compliance was assessed in isolated hearts. Using Sirius Red and fluorescence staining, the collagen in diabetic hearts was visualized. MTT assay was used to select non\u2011cytotoxic concentrations of matrine, which were subsequently used to treat isolated cardiac fibroblasts incubated under various conditions. Western blotting was performed to assess activation of the transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21)/Smad signaling pathway. Rats with DbCM exhibited impaired heart compliance and left ventricular (LV) functions. Excessive collagen deposition in cardiac tissue was also observed. Furthermore, TGF\u2011\u03b21/R\u2011Smad (Smad2/3) signaling was revealed to be markedly activated; however, the expression of inhibitory Smad (I\u2011Smad, also termed Smad7) was reduced in DbCM. Matrine administration led to a marked recovery in LV function and heart compliance by exerting inhibitory effects on TGF\u2011\u03b21/R\u2011Smad signaling pathway\u2011induced fibrosis without affecting I\u2011Smad. Incubation with a high concentration of glucose triggered the TGF\u2011\u03b21/R\u2011Smad (Smad2/3) signaling pathway and suppressed I\u2011Smad signaling transduction in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, which led to an increase in the synthesis of collagen. After cardiac fibroblasts had been treated with matrine at non\u2011cytotoxic concentrations without affecting I\u2011Smad, matrine blocked TGF\u2011\u03b21/R\u2011Smad signaling transduction to repress collagen production and deposition. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that TGF\u2011\u03b21/Smad signaling\u2011associated cardiac fibrosis is involved in the impairment of heart compliance and LV dysfunction in DbCM.

Heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HT(x)) was used as a model for heart unloading. Cardiac atrophy was assessed from the ratio of the native- to-transplanted heart weight (HW). The degree of cardiac atrophy after HT(x) was determined on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after HT(x) in recipients of either healthy or failing hearts. HT(x) of healthy hearts resulted in 23+/-3, 46+/-3, 48+/-4 and 46+/-4 % HW loss at the four time-points. HT(x) of the failing heart resulted in even greater HW losses, of 46+/-4, 58+/-3, 66+/-2 and 68+/-4 %, respectively (P<0.05). Activation of \"fetal gene cardiac program\" (e.g. beta myosin heavy chain gene expression) and \"genes reflecting cardiac remodeling\" (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression) after HT(x) was greater in failing than in healthy hearts (P<0.05 each time). Exposure to isocaloric high sugar diet caused significant increases in fatty acid concentrations in healthy and in failing hearts. However, these increases were not associated with any change in the course of cardiac atrophy, similarly in healthy and post-HT(x) failing hearts.

Recently, cases of hip implant-associated myocardial injury have been reported. However, we are not aware of any previous study that has systematically measured myocardial metal levels or examined the relationship with total hip arthroplasty (THA).\nArchives of our institution were queried for autopsies of individuals who had undergone THA between 1990 and 2013. Myocardial tissue samples were analyzed for cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) levels with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Seventy-five Co/Cr-on-polyethylene THA cases were included (mean age at time of death = 77.4 years; 49% women) as were 73 non-arthroplasty controls matched for age, sex, and history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\nSignificantly higher median myocardial concentrations of Co were observed in individuals with THA compared with controls (0.12 versus 0.06 \u03bcg/g, p < 0.0001). The median Co concentration was 69% higher in patients who had undergone THA revision (0.169 \u03bcg/g) than in those who underwent primary THA (0.100 \u03bcg/g; p = 0.004). In general, higher Co levels were observed in those with multiple replaced joints, although this finding only trended toward significance. Cardiomegaly, interstitial fibrosis, and decreased ejection fraction were observed more frequently in the postmortem samples of patients with implants than in those of controls (p = 0.0002, 0.044, and 0.0039, respectively).\nWe believe this to be the first study to quantify metal levels in cardiac tissue in patients with and without joint replacement. The elevated Co levels, in concert with cardiomegaly and increased interstitial fibrosis found during autopsy, in the arthroplasty cohort are novel, important findings. Although Co levels were significantly elevated above those in controls, the majority were below those seen in clinical case reports of death from Co cardiotoxicity associated with metal-on-metal prostheses.\nTherapeutic Level III.

{"title": "Early Postnatal Cardiomyocyte Proliferation Requires High Oxidative Energy Metabolism.", "abstract": "Cardiac energy metabolism must cope with early postnatal changes in tissue oxygen tensions, hemodynamics, and cell proliferation to sustain development. Here, we tested the hypothesis that proliferating neonatal cardiomyocytes are dependent on high oxidative energy metabolism. We show that energy-related gene expression does not correlate with functional oxidative measurements in the developing heart. Gene expression analysis suggests a gradual overall upregulation of oxidative-related genes and pathways, whereas functional assessment in both cardiac tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes indicated that oxidative metabolism decreases between the first and seventh days after birth. Cardiomyocyte extracellular flux analysis indicated that the decrease in oxidative metabolism between the first and seventh days after birth was mostly related to lower rates of ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that overall energetic demands decrease during this period. In parallel, the proliferation rate was higher for early cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, in vitro nonlethal chemical inhibition of mitochondrial respiration reduced the proliferative capacity of early cardiomyocytes, indicating a high energy demand to sustain cardiomyocyte proliferation. Altogether, we provide evidence that early postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity correlates with high oxidative energy metabolism.

We studied these interactions through an engineered heart tissue (EHT) model of fibrotic myocardium and a mathematical model of the effects of cellular composition on EHT impulse conduction velocity. The EHT model allowed for modulation of cardiomyocyte and myofibroblast volume fractions, and observation of cell behavior in a three-dimensional environment that is more similar to native heart tissue than is planar cell culture.

Such fibroblast clumps can become sources of pathological reentrant activities, e.g., spiral or scroll waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue. The occurrence of reentry in cardiac tissue with heterogeneities, such as fibroblast clumps, can depend on the frequency at which the medium is paced. Therefore, it is important to study the reentry-initiating potential of such fibroblast clumps at different frequencies of pacing. We investigate the arrhythmogenic effects of fibroblast clumps at high- and low-frequency pacing. We find that reentrant waves are induced in the medium more prominently at high-frequency pacing than with low-frequency pacing. We also study the other factors that affect the potential of fibroblast clumps to induce reentry in cardiac tissue. In particular, we show that the ability of a fibroblast clump to induce reentry depends on the size of the clump, the distribution and percentage of fibroblasts in the clump, and the excitability of the medium.

The silent presentation and the high mortality and/or morbidity of CVD in ARDs necessitate a reliable tool for early diagnosis. Noninvasive cardiovascular imaging, including echocardiography, nuclear imaging, cardiovascular computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and hybrid imaging modalities, constitutes the main tool for monitoring of CVD in ARDs. Echocardiography is the cornerstone for CVD evaluation, but it is operator-dependent and cannot perform tissue characterization. Nuclear imaging and CT, although promising, have the disadvantage of ionizing radiation. CMR can assess inflammation, ischemia, and fibrosis without ionizing radiation, thus making it a necessary adjunct, which is especially relevant for ARDs with new-onset heart failure, conflicting data from other imaging modalities, and recent onset of chest pain and/or arrhythmias.

The present study aimed to investigate how MLT protects the heart through modulating myocardial apoptosis in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In total, 36 rats were randomly divided into three groups, including control (n=12), DM (n=12) and DM\u00a0+\u00a0MLT (n=12) groups. The results demonstrated that, in DM rats, a significant increase was observed in the serum fasting blood glucose and lipid levels, in addition to insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction, which were attenuated in DM rats treated with MLT. Additionally, cellular apoptosis in rats with DM was increased, and the expression of Bcl\u20112 was downregulated, while levels of Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X and caspase\u20113 were upregulated, and these observations were reversed by MLT, as determined by TUNEL and western blot analysis, respectively. As increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by hyperglycemia is reported to be a factor for apoptosis, the present study also determined the expression of proteins associated with ER stress in cardiac tissues following MLT treatment by western blotting. The results further indicated that MLT decreased the expression of ER stress hallmarks, including CCAAT/enhancer\u2011binding protein homologous protein, glucose\u2011regulated protein 78, protein kinase RNA\u2011like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6\u03b1 in cardiac tissues.

Viral myocarditis (VMC) characterized by viral-myocardial-cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration is a common clinical disease of the cardiovascular system. However, the role of Sema7A in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced VMC has not been reported. In this study, we generated an acute VMC mouse model by CVB3 infection, and manipulated Sema7A expression by in vivo polyethyleneimine-mediated Sema7A down-regulation. Our results indicated that Sema7A was up-regulated in cardiomyocytes during VMC, and that Sema7A down-regulation following short hairpin RNA interference or mAb neutralization effectively protected mice from VMC. Additionally, reduced inflammatory responses were observed along with Sema7A down-regulation. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages exacerbated CVB3-induced myocarditis, suggesting the significance of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages in response to VMC.

Transplantation of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has recently progressed as a novel treatment to repair damaged cardiac tissue but its efficacy has been limited by poor survival of transplanted cells owing to oxidative stress in the post-transplantation environment. Identification of small molecules that activate cardioprotective pathways to prevent oxidative damage and increase survival of stem cells post-transplantation is therefore of great interest for improving the efficacy of stem cell therapies. This report describes a chemical biology phenotypic screening approach to identify and validate small molecules that protect human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from oxidative stress. A luminescence-based high-throughput assay for cell viability was used to screen a diverse collection of 48,640 small molecules for protection of hiPSC-CMs from peroxide-induced cell death. Cardioprotective activity of \"hit\" compounds was confirmed using impedance-based detection of cardiomyocyte monolayer integrity and contractile function. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the identification of a potent class of compounds with 4-(pyridine-2-yl)thiazole scaffold. Examination of gene expression in hiPSC-CMs revealed that the hit compound, designated cardioprotectant 312 (CP-312), induces robust upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, a marker of the antioxidant response network that has been strongly correlated with protection of cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress. CP-312 therefore represents a novel chemical scaffold identified by phenotypic high-throughput screening using hiPSC-CMs that activates the antioxidant defense response and may lead to improved pharmacological cardioprotective therapies.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2017-11-05", "authors": ["R JasonKirby", "Daniela BDivlianska", "KanupriyaWhig", "NadezdaBryan", "Camilo JMorfa", "AdaKoo", "Kevin HNguyen", "PatrickMaloney", "SatayamaheshwarPeddibhotla", "E HamptonSessions", "Paul MHershberger", "Layton HSmith", "SiobhanMalany"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.117.243717"}

We investigated whether prolonged exposure to a low dose of VEGF could be achieved by encapsulating VEGF in polylactic coglycolic acid nanoparticles and whether treatment with VEGF-containing nanoparticles improved cardiac function and protected against left ventricular remodeling in the hearts of mice with experimentally induced myocardial infarction. Polylactic coglycolic acid nanoparticles with a mean diameter of ~113 nm were generated via double emulsion and loaded with VEGF; the encapsulation efficiency was 53.5 \u00b1 1.7% (107.1 \u00b1 3.3 ng VEGF/mg nanoparticles). In culture, VEGF nanoparticles released VEGF continuously for at least 31 days, and in a murine myocardial infarction model, VEGF nanoparticle administration was associated with significantly greater vascular density in the peri-infarct region, reductions in infarct size, and improvements in left ventricular contractile function 4 wk after treatment.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of Pycnogenol in ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a critical task in the biochemical and pathological alteration linked with myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI). This warrants identifying agents with a potential for preventing such damage in an effective way. A novel plant based product, Pycnogenol, obtained from the French maritime pine (Pinus pinaster ssp. atlantica) bark extract was known for its tremendous antioxidant potential (both in vivo, in vitro). It was able to attenuate the symptoms of immune dysfunction through restoring a cellular antioxidant status in low micronutrient-induced immune deficient mice. Consequently, the present study was deals with the determination of protective effect of Pycnogenol in ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats via Non-recirculating Langendorff's technique. The effect of Pycnogenol\u00a0 on the level of various key biomarkers in the rat heart homogenate was determined, such as, myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, a marker of lipid peroxidation), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (a marker of tissue injury) and effect on endogenous antioxidants, e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The activity of these biomarkers appreciably improved in Pycnogenol-treated group than IRI group (P &lt; 0.05). The effect of Pycnogenol was further confirmed via histopathological examination of cardiac tissues, which suggests that, it considerably improved the injury related to tissue damage through suppression of edema and infiltration of neutrophil compared to IRI group. It also showed modulation of the expression of apoptotic factors, e.g. Bcl-2, bax and caspase-9 as confirmed by western blot analysis.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)", "date": "2017-11-04", "authors": ["PXiao", "KZhang", "ZTao", "NLiu", "BGe"], "doi": "10.14715/cmb/2017.63.10.7"}

This study investigated the protective potential of PJ against lead-induced oxidative stress. A total of forty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups. The animals were fed a standard pellet diet and tap water ad libitum. The rats were divided into four groups (n=10 for each group): control, lead asetat (2000 ppm), low-treated PJ- a daily dose of 2.000 ppm lead plus 30\u00b5l pomegranate juice (included 1.050 \u00b5mol total polyphenols, gallic acid equivalent), and high-treated PJ- a daily dose of 2.000 ppm lead plus 60\u00b5l pomegranate juice (included 2.100 \u00b5mol total polyphenols, gallic acid equivalent). The treatments were delivered for 5 weeks. After the treatment period, the tissues samples (kidney, liver, heart and testis) were collected. Tissue lead (Pb) and mineral amounts (copper, zinc, and iron), tissues lipid peroxidation level and antioxidant status, and tissues histopathological changes were determined. The results showed that the highest rate lead loading was in the kidney and the testis. Pomegranate juice was decreased the lead levels of soft tissues examined; increased Zn amounts in tissues of which the lead accumulation was higher (kidney and the testis); decreased the copper, zinc and the iron levels of the liver and heart tissues, without creating a weakness in antioxidant capacity of these tissues, restricted the oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation, improved both of the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalaz (CAT), and the level of glutathione (GSH) in all the tissues examined in lead-treated groups. As histopathological findings, the cellular damage induced by lead in the tissues of the kidney, liver and the heart were observed to have been partially prevented by PJ treatment.

{"title": "MicroRNA as a Therapeutic Target in Cardiac Remodeling.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that contain 18-25 nucleotides. The alterations in their expression level play crucial role in the development of many disorders including heart diseases. Myocardial remodeling is the final pathological consequence of a variety of myocardial diseases. miRNAs have central role in regulating pathogenesis of myocardial remodeling by modulating cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes injury, cardiac fibrosis, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response through multiple mechanisms. The balancing and tight regulation of different miRNAs is a key to drive the cellular events towards functional recovery and any fall in this leads to detrimental effect on cardiac function following various insults. In this review, we discuss the impact of alterations of miRNAs expression on cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes injury, cardiac fibrosis, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response.

{"title": "Scanning X-ray diffraction on cardiac tissue: automatized data analysis and processing.", "abstract": "A scanning X-ray diffraction study of cardiac tissue has been performed, covering the entire cross section of a mouse heart slice. To this end, moderate focusing by compound refractive lenses to micrometer spot size, continuous scanning, data acquisition by a fast single-photon-counting pixel detector, and fully automated analysis scripts have been combined. It was shown that a surprising amount of structural data can be harvested from such a scan, evaluating the local scattering intensity, interfilament spacing of the muscle tissue, the filament orientation, and the degree of anisotropy. The workflow of data analysis is described and a data analysis toolbox with example data for general use is provided. Since many cardiomyopathies rely on the structural integrity of the sarcomere, the contractile unit of cardiac muscle cells, the present study can be easily extended to characterize tissue from a diseased heart.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2017-11-02", "authors": ["Jan DavidNicolas", "MartenBernhardt", "AndreaMarkus", "FraukeAlves", "ManfredBurghammer", "TimSalditt"], "doi": "10.1107/S1600577517011936"}
{"title": "Collagen scaffold enhances the regenerative properties of mesenchymal stromal cells.", "abstract": "MSCs are widely applied to regenerate heart tissue in myocardial diseases but when grown in standard two-dimensional (2D) cultures exhibit limited potential for cardiac repair and develop fibrogenic features with increasing culture time. MSCs can undergo partial cardiomyogenic differentiation, which improves their cardiac repair capacity. When applied to collagen patches they may improve cardiac tissue regeneration but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the regenerative properties of MSCs grown in a collagen scaffold as a three-dimensional (3D) culture system, and performed functional analysis using an engineered heart tissue (EHT) model. We showed that the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins by MSCs co-cultured with rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was increased in collagen patches versus conventional cultures. MSCs in 3D collagen patches were less fibrogenic, secreted more cardiotrophic factors, retained anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory function, and responded less to TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. EHT analysis showed no effects by MSCs on cardiomyocyte function, whereas control dermal fibroblasts abrogated the beating of cardiac tissue constructs. We conclude that 3D collagen scaffold improves the cardioprotective effects of MSCs by enhancing the production of trophic factors and modifying their immune modulatory and fibrogenic phenotype. The improvement in myocardial function by MSCs after acquisition of a partial cardiac cell-like phenotype is not due to enhanced MSC contractility. A better understanding of the mechanisms of MSC-mediated tissue repair will help to further enhance the therapeutic potency of MSCs.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": ["IranRashedi", "NileshTalele", "Xing-HuaWang", "BorisHinz", "MilicaRadisic", "ArmandKeating"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0187348\n10.1186/1423-0127-19-93\n10.1093/ejcts/ezs480\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.052\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0306\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.030\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.02.008\n10.1073/pnas.1008117107\n10.1002/stem.1191\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2009.0432\n10.1089/scd.2013.0338\n10.3109/14653240902988818\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0329\n10.1007/s12015-013-9483-y\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2009.0362\n10.1152/ajpheart.01009.2005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.03.066\n10.1152/ajpheart.00219.2008\n10.2143/AC.60.3.2005005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.071\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1002/bit.22987\n10.1073/pnas.0905729106\n10.1038/jid.2010.224\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015652\n10.1038/nmat4780\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0674\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.05.004\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304386\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304346\n10.1111/trf.12826\n10.1002/bit.22647\n10.1007/s00441-013-1576-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.08.069\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.038\n10.1002/cbf.3027\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0278\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.11.040\n10.1073/pnas.0903201106\n10.1002/stem.1560\n10.1007/s00395-011-0221-9\n10.1038/nm.1905\n10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010088\n10.1002/stem.1543\n10.1002/stem.2485\n10.1089/biores.2015.0044\n10.1002/jbm.a.33121"}

Forty male albino rats were allocated into control, ATRA (0.5\u00a0mg/kg bwt, intraperitoneally daily), DOX (2.5\u00a0mg/kg bwt, intraperitoneally twice weekly for 3\u00a0weeks), and DOX\u00a0+\u00a0ATRA groups. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-cardiac type (CK-MB), troponin I, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. In addition, cardiac glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. Cardiac tissues were examined for histopathologic changes and immunoexpression of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and tumor-suppressor p53 proteins. DOX caused severe myocardial damage; degenerative and necrotic changes and worsened cardiac function biomarkers; and elevated serum LDH, CK, CK-MB, and troponin I. In addition, DOX inhibited cardiac antioxidative enzymes (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, CAT) activities and enhanced MDA level. DOX increased serum proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and area percent of caspase 3 and p53 immunoexpression in heart tissues. Pretreatment with ATRA maintained cardiac function biomarkers, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and immunoexpression of caspase 3 and p53. Moreover, ATRA improved cardiac histoarchitecture, as well as the activities of antioxidative enzymes. Collectively, ATRA can counteract DOX-induced cardiomyopathy through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, besides suppression of the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": ["Asmaa FKhafaga", "Yasser SEl-Sayed"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-017-1437-5"}
{"title": "Early structural changes of the heart after experimental polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock.", "abstract": "Evidence is emerging that systemic inflammation after trauma drives structural and functional impairment of cardiomyocytes and leads to cardiac dysfunction, thus worsening the outcome of polytrauma patients. This study investigates the structural and molecular changes in heart tissue 4 h after multiple injuries with additional hemorrhagic shock using a clinically relevant rodent model of polytrauma. We determined mediators of systemic inflammation (keratinocyte chemoattractant, macrophage chemotactic protein 1), activated complement component C3a and cardiac troponin I in plasma and assessed histological specimen of the mouse heart via standard histomorphology and immunohistochemistry for cellular and subcellular damage and ongoing apoptosis. Further we investigated spatial and quantitative changes of connexin 43 by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Our results show significantly increased plasma levels of both keratinocyte chemoattractant and cardiac troponin I 4 h after polytrauma and 2 h after induction of hypovolemia. Although we could not detect any morphological changes, immunohistochemical evaluation showed increased level of tissue high-mobility group box 1, which is both a damage-associated molecule and actively released as a danger response signal. Additionally, there was marked lateralization of the cardiac gap-junction protein connexin 43 following combined polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock. These results demonstrate a molecular manifestation of remote injury of cardiac muscle cells in the early phase after polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock with marked disruption of the cardiac gap junction.

Two patients received a second operation to remove the patches due to graft rejection and infections and skin autograft was implanted for reconstruction of the conjunctival sac.\nPolyester fiber heart patches are ideal materials for repairing Conjunctival sac narrowing and orbital implant exposure, but this approach is not suitable in cases of severe narrowing or occlusion of the conjunctival sac.\n\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f53\u76ae\u80a4\u79fb\u690d\u77eb\u6b63\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u690d\u5165\u672f\u540e\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u7578\u5f62\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9b\u76ae\u533a\u7684\u521b\u4f24\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u631b\u7f29\u3002\n\u6211\u79d12012\u5e746\u6708~2016\u5e746\u6708\u6536\u6cbb\u5df2\u690d\u5165\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u7578\u5f62\u60a3\u800512\u4f8b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec3\u4f8b\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\uff1b\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u4e2d\u592e\u5207\u5f00\u7ed3\u819c\u53ca\u6d45\u5c42\u7b4b\u819c\uff0c\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u7b4b\u819c\u4e0b\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u819c\u53ca\u6d45\u5c42\u7b4b\u819c\u4e0e\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u8868\u9762\u7b4b\u819c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7c98\u8fde\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u81f3\u7736\u7f18\u3002\u5236\u4f5c\u5927\u5c0f\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u6da4\u7eb6\u8865\u7247\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e8e\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u4e2d\u592e\u7ed3\u819c\u7f3a\u635f\u66b4\u9732\u533a\uff0c\u8865\u7247\u5468\u8fb9\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7736\u7f18\u9aa8\u819c\uff0c\u7ed3\u819c\u53ca\u6d45\u5c42\u7b4b\u819c\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7a79\u7abf\u5e95\u90e8\u5fc3\u810f\u6da4\u7eb6\u8865\u7247\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u5185\u690d\u5165\u9694\u819c\uff0c\u6c38\u4e45\u7751\u7f18\u7c98\u8fde\u3002\n8\u4f8b\u672f\u540e3\u6708\u5206\u79bb\u7751\u7f18\u7c98\u8fde\u540e\u690d\u5165\u4e49\u773c\uff0c2\u4f8b\u884c\u518d\u6b21\u4e0b\u7a79\u7abf\u6210\u5f62\u672f\u540e\u690d\u5165\u4e49\u773c\uff0c\u5916\u89c2\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\uff1b2\u4f8b\u5fc3\u810f\u6da4\u7eb6\u8865\u7247\u6392\u65a5\u5e76\u611f\u67d3\u53bb\u9664\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u4f53\u5168\u539a\u76ae\u7247\u884c\u5168\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u518d\u9020\u6210\u529f\u3002\n\u5fc3\u810f\u6da4\u7eb6\u8865\u7247\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u690d\u5165\u540e\u65e0\u773c\u7403\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u7578\u5f62\u53ca\u4e49\u773c\u53f0\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5b9c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5ea6\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u72ed\u7a84\u6216\u7ed3\u819c\u56ca\u95ed\u9501\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "journal": "Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University", "date": "2017-10-27", "authors": ["Bing-SongDong", "Cui-HuaXie", "Lin-JiangChen", "KeXiong", "JuanYang"], "doi": "10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2017.10.19\n10.3980/j.issn.1672-5123.2013.12.30\n10.3760/j:issn:0412-4081.2005.11.011\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.02.016\n10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2016.01.002\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.1006-4443.2002.10.027\n10.1016/j.ajo.2006.09.037\n10.1097/01.IOP.0000075794.80525.9D\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.11.014"}
{"title": "Preconditioning potential of purmorphamine: a hedgehog activator against ischaemic reperfusion injury in ovariectomised rat heart.", "abstract": "The present study was been designed to investigate the role and pharmacological potential of hedgehog in oestrogen-deficient rat heart.\nOestrogen deficiency was produced in female Wistar rats by the surgical removal of both ovaries and these animals were used four weeks later. Isolated rat heart was subjected to 30 min ischaemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion (I/R). The heart was subjected to pharmacological preconditioning with the hedgehog agonist purmorphamine (1\u03bcM) and GDC-0449, a hedgehog antagonist, in the last episode of reperfusion before I/R. Myocardial infarction was assessed in terms of the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), myeloperoxidase (MPO) level and infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining). Immunohistochemistry analysis was done for the assessment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 level in cardiac tissue. eNOS expression was estimated by rt-PCR.\nPharmacological preconditioning with purmorphamine significantly attenuated I/R-induced myocardial infarction, TNF-\u03b1, MPO level and release of LDH and CK-MB compared to the I/R control group. However, GDC-0449 prevented the ameliorative preconditioning effect of estradiol.\nIt may be concluded that the hedgehog agonist purmorphamine prevents the ovariectomised heart from ischaemic reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Perfusion", "date": "2017-10-27", "authors": ["ShwetaSharma", "AvileenKaur", "SaurabhSharma"], "doi": "10.1177/0267659117732401"}

{"title": "Cardiac oxidative stress following maternal separation stress was mitigated following adolescent voluntary exercise in adult male rat.", "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) is known as a risk factor for the development of depression and its associated comorbidities, such as cardiomyopathy in depressed patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression and cardiovascular diseases. Evidence indicates that regular physical activity has therapeutic effects on both mood and cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, the voluntary running wheel exercise (RW) during adolescence may be able to attenuate the negative impact of maternal separation stress (MS) as a valid animal model of depression on the behavior and cardiac mitochondrial function of adult rats. To do this, we applied MS to rat pups by separating them from their mothers for 180min during the postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 14. Next, the animals were randomly divided into different treatment groups (fluoxetine [FLX] and RW) and received the treatments during adolescence, between PND 28 to PND 60. Then, we evaluated the effects of MS on the rat behaviors test, and finally, we assessed reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial glutathione, ATP and cytochrome c release in the cardiac tissue of animals. Our results showed that depressive-like behaviors following MS in adult male rats were associated with oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. Further, we found that treating animals with chronic FLX or RW during adolescence improved animal's behavior as well as cardiac mitochondrial function. The results of this study highlight the importance of adolescence as a period during which treating animals with non-pharmacological agents has significant protective effects against the negative influence of ELS on mood and cardiac energy hemostasis.", "journal": "Physiology & behavior", "date": "2017-10-25", "authors": ["EhtramolsadatSahafi", "MaghsoudPeeri", "Mir-JamalHosseini", "Mohammad AliAzarbayjani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.10.022"}

Atrial preparations from five rats were superfused at tissue bath temperatures between 36.7\u00b0C and 43.8\u00b0C. Optical mapping data showed an elevated median CV by 21% when increasing the temperature from 36.7\u00b0C to 42.0\u00b0C. CV did not increase above 42.0\u00b0C. Electrical measurements revealed a similar temperature dependence of CV between 36.7\u00b0C and 42.0\u00b0C, i.e. an increase of median CV by 26%. The consolidation of optical and electrical data in this study allowed investigation of excitation during global hyperthermia.

{"title": "Modelling Torsade de Pointes arrhythmias in vitro in 3D human iPS cell-engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is a lethal arrhythmia that is often drug-induced, thus there is an urgent need for development of models to test or predict the drug sensitivity of human cardiac tissue. Here, we present an in vitro TdP model using 3D cardiac tissue sheets (CTSs) that contain a mixture of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes. We simultaneously monitor the extracellular field potential (EFP) and the contractile movement of the CTSs. Upon treatment with IKr channel blockers, CTSs exhibit tachyarrhythmias with characteristics of TdP, including both a typical polymorphic EFP and meandering spiral wave re-entry. The TdP-like waveform is predominantly observed in CTSs with the cell mixture, indicating that cellular heterogeneity and the multi-layered 3D structure are both essential factors for reproducing TdP-like arrhythmias in vitro.

{"title": "Label-free imaging of redox status and collagen deposition showing metabolic differences in the heart.", "abstract": "The heart has high metabolic demand to maintain function. The primary source of energy supply to support correct contractile muscle function differs between a fetus and an adult. In fetal life, ATP is primarily generated by glycolysis and lactate oxidation, whereas following birth, there is a shift towards a reliance on mitochondrial metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. This change in metabolic status is an adaptation to different fuel availability, oxygenation and growth patterns. In this study, we have employed 2-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to define the relationship between two critical metabolic cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(P)H and flavin adenine dinucleotide, effectively utilizing a redox ratio to differentiate between the metabolic status in fetal (proliferative) and adult (quiescent/hypertrophic) hearts. Two-photon imaging was also used to visually confirm the known increase in collagen deposition in the adult heart. The changes observed were consistent with a hypertrophic growth profile and greater availability of fatty acids in the adult heart, compared to the proliferative fetal heart. Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy is therefore a convenient imaging technology that enables the monitoring of striated muscle architecture and the metabolic status of heart tissue. This imaging technology can potentially be employed to visualize cardiac and other muscle pathologies.", "journal": "Journal of biophotonics", "date": "2017-10-24", "authors": ["Janna LMorrison", "AlexandraSorvina", "Jack R TDarby", "Christie ABader", "Mitchell CLock", "MikeSeed", "TimKuchel", "Sally EPlush", "Douglas ABrooks"], "doi": "10.1002/jbio.201700242"}

Five Hsa21 miRNAs have been well studied in the past: miR-99a-5p, miR-125b-2-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-802-5p but few information is available about their expression in trisomic tissues. In this study, we evaluated the expression of these miRNAs in heart tissues from DS fetuses, showing that miR-99a-5p, miR-155-5p, and let-7c-5p were overexpressed in trisomic hearts. To investigate their role, predicted targets were obtained from different databases and cross-validated using the gene expression profiling dataset we previously generated for fetal hearts. Eighty-five targets of let-7c-5p, 33 of miR-155-5p, and 10 of miR-99a-5p were expressed in fetal heart and downregulated in trisomic hearts. As nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes were found downregulated in trisomic hearts and mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of DS phenotypes, we put special attention to let-7c-5p and miR-155-5p targets downregulated in DS fetal hearts and involved in mitochondrial function.

Despite decreased time to intervention and improvements in the standard of care, 1 out of 5 patients that survive a myocardial infarction (MI) still face long-term chronic heart failure and a 5-year mortality rate of about 50%. Based on their multi-potency for differentiation and paracrine activity, epicardial cells and their derivatives have potential to rescue jeopardized tissue and/or promote cardiac regeneration. Here we review the diagnosis and treatment of MI, basic epicardial cell biology, and potential treatment strategies designed to harness the reparative properties of epicardial cells.\nDuring cardiac development, epicardial cells covering the surface of the heart generate migratory progenitor cells that contribute to the coronary vasculature and the interstitial fibroblasts. Epicardial cells also produce paracrine signals required for myocardial expansion and cardiac growth. In adults with myocardial infarction, epicardial cells and their derivatives provide paracrine factors that affect myocardial remodeling and repair. At present, the intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals that regulate epicardial cell fate and paracrine activity in adults remain poorly understood.\nHuman diseases that result in heart failure due to negative remodeling or extensive loss of viable cardiac tissue require new, effective treatments.

{"title": "Protein/polysaccharide-based scaffolds mimicking native extracellular matrix for cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has emerged as a viable approach to treat disease or repair damage in tissues and organs. One of the key elements for the success of tissue engineering is the use of a scaffold serving as artificial extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM hosts the cells and improves their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, enabling the formation of new tissue. Here, we propose the development of a class of protein/polysaccharide-based porous scaffolds for use as ECM substitutes in cardiac tissue engineering. Scaffolds based on blends of a protein component, collagen or gelatin, with a polysaccharide component, alginate, were produced by freeze-drying and subsequent ionic and chemical crosslinking. Their morphological, physicochemical, and mechanical properties were determined and compared with those of natural porcine myocardium. We demonstrated that our scaffolds possessed highly porous and interconnected structures, and the chemical homogeneity of the natural ECM was well reproduced in both types of scaffolds. Furthermore, the alginate/gelatin (AG) scaffolds better mimicked the native tissue in terms of interactions between components and protein secondary structure, and in terms of swelling behavior. The AG scaffolds also showed superior mechanical properties for the desired application and supported better adhesion, growth, and differentiation of myoblasts under static conditions. The AG scaffolds were subsequently used for culturing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, where high viability of the resulting cardiac constructs was observed under dynamic flow culture in a microfluidic bioreactor. We therefore propose our protein/polysaccharide scaffolds as a viable ECM substitute for applications in cardiac tissue engineering. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "UV-Assisted 3D Bioprinting of Nanoreinforced Hybrid Cardiac Patch for Myocardial Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Biofabrication of cell supportive cardiac patches that can be directly implanted on myocardial infarct is a potential solution for myocardial infarction repair. Ideally, cardiac patches should be able to mimic myocardium extracellular matrix for rapid integration with the host tissue, raising the need to develop cardiac constructs with complex features. In particular, cardiac patches should be electrically conductive, mechanically robust and elastic, biologically active and prevascularized. In this study, we aim to biofabricate a nanoreinforced hybrid cardiac patch laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) with improved electrical, mechanical, and biological behavior. A safe ultraviolet (UV) exposure time with insignificant effect on cell viability was identified for methacrylated collagen (MeCol) micropatterning. The effects of carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on MeCol and alginate matrix morphology, mechanical properties, electrical behavior, and cellular response were investigated at different CNT mass ratios. A UV-integrated 3D-bioprinting technique was implemented to create hybrid hydrogel constructs consisting of CNT-incorporated alginate framework and cell-laden MeCol. The compressive modulus, impedance, and swelling degree of hybrid constructs were assessed over 20 days of incubation in culture medium at 37\u00b0C for different CNT mass ratios. The HCAEC viability, proliferation, and differentiation in the context of the bioprinted hybrid constructs were assessed over 10 days in vitro. The functionalized CNTs provided a highly interconnected nanofibrous meshwork that significantly improved viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of photo-cross-linked MeCol. Alginate-coated CNTs provided a nanofilamentous network with fiber size of \u223c25-500\u2009nm, improving not only electrical and mechanical properties but also HCAEC attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate. The CNT-reinforced 3D-printed hybrid constructs presented significantly higher stiffness and electrical conductivity particularly in the physiologically relevant frequency range (\u223c5\u2009Hz). The CNT-reinforced hybrid implants maintained a significantly higher swelling degree over 20 days of culturing compared to CNT-free hybrid constructs. For a selected CNT mass ratio, HCAECs presented significant cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (lumen-like formation) over 10 days of incubation in vitro.

{"title": "Natural Antioxidants as Potential Therapy, and a Promising Role for Melatonin Against Pulmonary Hypertension.", "abstract": "Plasma and serum samples, and lung/heart tissue of pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients and animal models of PH display elevated oxidative stress. Moreover, the severity of PH and levels of oxidative stress increase concurrently, which suggests that oxidative stress could be utilized as a biomarker for PH progression. Accumulating evidence has well established that oxidative stress is also key role player in the development of PH. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that natural antioxidants improved PH condition, and, therefore, antioxidant therapy has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy against PH. These natural antioxidants include medicinal plant extracts and compounds such as resveratrol and melatonin. Recent studies suggest that melatonin provides health benefit against PH, by enhancing antioxidant capacity, increasing vasodilation, counteracting lung and cardiac fibrosis, and stunting right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy/failure. This chapter comprehensively reviews and discusses a variety of natural antioxidants and their efficacy in modulating experimental PH.

{"title": "The role of PI3K\u03b1 isoform in cardioprotection.", "abstract": "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) limits myocardial infarct size through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signal cascade; however, little is known about the roles of individual PI3K isoforms in cardioprotection. We aimed, therefore, to elucidate the role of the PI3K\u03b1 isoform in cardioprotection Pharmacological PI3K\u03b1 inhibition was assessed in isolated-perfused mouse hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), either during the IPC procedure or at reperfusion. PI3K\u03b1 inhibition abrogated the IPC-induced protective effect at reperfusion, but not when given only during the IPC protocol. These results were confirmed in an in vivo model. Moreover, pharmacological PI3K\u03b1 activation by insulin at reperfusion was sufficient to confer cardioprotection against IRI. In addition, PI3K\u03b1 was shown to be expressed and activated in mouse cardiomyocytes, mouse cardiac endothelial cells, as well as in mouse and human heart tissue. Furthermore, PI3K\u03b1 was shown to mediate its effect though the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. In conclusion, PI3K\u03b1 activity is required during the early reperfusion phase to reduce myocardial infarct size. This suggests that strategies specifically enhancing the \u03b1 isoform of PI3K at reperfusion promote tissue salvage and as such, and could provide a direct target for clinical treatment of IRI.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": ["XavierRossello", "Jaime ARiquelme", "ZhenheHe", "StasaTaferner", "BartVanhaesebroeck", "Sean MDavidson", "Derek MYellon"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-017-0657-7\n10.1007/s003950050142\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175018\n10.1016/S0022-2828(02)00310-3\n10.1126/scisignal.1161577\n10.1016/j.ccell.2014.11.007\n10.1042/bj3410233\n10.1016/j.biocel.2005.09.017\n10.1038/nature04694\n10.1152/ajpheart.00749.2016\n10.1007/s11897-011-0059-3\n10.1073/pnas.0707761105\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.011\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.06.005\n10.1007/s10741-007-9026-1\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01483\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305348\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310820\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.10.031\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259556\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308736\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1118\n10.1161/hh2401.101385\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000412\n10.1007/BF00430828\n10.1111/bph.12902\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.035\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.201988\n10.1007/s00395-014-0414-0\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.873380\n10.1093/cvr/cvv016\n10.1073/pnas.0606663104\n10.1073/pnas.1934654100\n10.1001/jama.293.4.437\n10.1161/01.CIR.74.5.1124\n10.1093/cvr/cvp014\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.090126\n10.1007/s10557-016-6673-2\n10.1177/1074248415604462\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022829\n10.1001/jama.2012.426\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00796.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.186429\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306878\n10.1177/1074248416657611\n10.1016/0002-9149(62)90035-8\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-3051\n10.1161/01.RES.0000126048.32383.6B\n10.1016/j.tibs.2005.02.008\n10.1007/s00109-015-1352-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00531.2008\n10.1016/0140-6736(93)91819-8\n10.1056/NEJMra071667"}
{"title": "Bmi1 and BRG1 drive myocardial repair by regulating cardiac stem cell function in acute rheumatic heart disease.", "abstract": "Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) occurs due to the accumulation of complications associated with rheumatic fever, and it results in high morbidity and mortality. The majority of cases of RHD are diagnosed in the chronic stages, when treatment options are limited. A small reservoir of cardiac stem cells is responsible for maintaining cardiac homeostasis and repairing tissue damage. Understanding the role of cardiac stem cells and the various proteins responsible for their functions in different pathological stages of RHD is an important area of investigation. Polycomb complex protein BMI-1 (Bmi1) and transcription activator BRG1 (BRG1) are associated with the maintenance of stemness in various types of stem cells. The present study investigated the role served by Bmi1 and BRG1 in cardiac stem cells during various pathological stages of RHD through immunohistochemistry and western blotting. A rat model of RHD was established via immunization with the Group A Streptococcus M5 protein. The rat was demonstrated to develop acute RHD 2 months after the final immunization, characterized by cardiac inflammation and tissue damage. Chronic RHD was identified 4 months after the final immunization, revealed by cardiac tissue compression and shrinkage. Expression of the cardiac stem cell marker mast/stem cell growth factor receptor kit was identified to be elevated during acute RHD, but downregulated in the chronic stages of RHD. A similar pattern of expression was revealed for Bmi1 and BRG1, indicating that they serve a role in regulating cardiac stem cell proliferation during acute RHD. These results suggest that cardiac stem cells serve a supportive role in the acute, but not chronic, stages of RHD via expression of Bmi1 and BRG1.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": ["PingxiXiao", "KaiZhang", "ZhiwenTao", "NiannianLiu", "BangshunGe", "MinXu", "XinzhengLu"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2017.4936\n10.1111/j.1440-1754.2012.02447.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu449\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003495\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61171-9\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.197\n10.1111/j.1540-8175.2011.01487.x\n10.1016/0090-1229(89)90174-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.3.415\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.5.2198\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.03.010\n10.1586/14779072.2014.972941\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.240648\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302302\n10.1101/gad.8.7.757\n10.1186/s13287-015-0196-9\n10.1038/nature09130\n10.1128/IAI.01514-08\n10.1097/00001756-199412000-00031\n10.1073/pnas.76.9.4350\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.04.008\n10.1172/JCI63068\n10.1172/JCI200420800\n10.1089/biores.2013.0047\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.044\n10.1002/stem.1498\n10.2147/CLEP.S12977\n10.3389/fped.2014.00116\n10.4103/0974-2069.79617\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243154"}

Patients with LC amyloid involvement of the heart have the worst morbidity and mortality. Current treatments target the plasma cells to reduce further production of amyloid proteins. There is dire need to understand the mechanisms of cardiac tissue damage from amyloid to develop novel therapies. We recently reported that LC soluble and fibrillar species cause apoptosis and inhibit cell growth in human cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can promote wound healing and tissue remodeling. The objective of this study was to evaluate MSCs to protect cardiomyocytes affected by AL amyloid fibrils.\nWe used live cell imaging and proteomics to analyze the effect of MSCs in the growth arrest caused by AL amyloid fibrils.\nWe evaluated the growth of human cardiomyocytes (RFP-AC16 cells) in the presence of cytotoxic LC amyloid fibrils.

Immense research effort has been focused toward creating new screening platforms that utilize human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue constructs to better recapitulate human heart function and drug responses. As these new platforms become increasingly sophisticated and high throughput, the drug screens result in larger multidimensional datasets. Improved automated analysis methods must therefore be developed in parallel to fully comprehend the cellular response across a multidimensional parameter space. Here, we describe the use of machine learning to comprehensively analyze 17 functional parameters derived from force readouts of hPSC-derived ventricular cardiac tissue strips (hvCTS) electrically paced at a range of frequencies and exposed to a library of compounds. A generated metric is effective for then determining the cardioactivity of a given drug. Furthermore, we demonstrate a classification model that can automatically predict the mechanistic action of an unknown cardioactive drug.", "journal": "Stem cell reports", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": ["Eugene KLee", "David DTran", "WendyKeung", "PatrickChan", "GabrielWong", "Camie WChan", "Kevin DCosta", "Ronald ALi", "MichelleKhine"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.09.008"}
{"title": "Clinical genetics and outcome of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to clinically and genetically characterize LVNC patients and investigate the prevalence of variants in known and novel LVNC disease genes.\nLeft ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. We sought here to dissect its genetic causes, phenotypic presentation and outcome.\nIn our registry with follow-up of in the median 61\u2009months, we analysed 95 LVNC patients (68 unrelated index patients and 27 affected relatives; definite familial LVNC\u2009=\u200923.5%) by cardiac phenotyping, molecular biomarkers and exome sequencing. Cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in LVNC patients compared with an age-matched group of patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20092.481, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Stringent genetic classification according to ACMG guidelines revealed that TTN, LMNA, and MYBPC3 are the most prevalent disease genes (13 patients are carrying a pathogenic truncating TTN variant, odds ratio\u2009=\u200940.7, Confidence interval\u2009=\u200921.6-76.6, P\u2009<\u20090.0001, percent spliced in 76-100%). We also identified novel candidate genes for LVNC. For RBM20, we were able to perform detailed familial, molecular and functional studies. We show that the novel variant p.R634L in the RS domain of RBM20 co-segregates with LVNC, leading to titin mis-splicing as revealed by RNA sequencing of heart tissue in mutation carriers, protein analysis, and functional splice-reporter assays.\nOur data demonstrate that the clinical course of symptomatic LVNC can be severe.

DOX-CM rats were induced by intraperitoneally injected doxorubicin. Six weeks after intervention, the indices from the transthoracic echocardiography and velocity vector imaging showed that the left ventricular function in the MaFGF-loaded NP (MaFGF-NP) + UTMD group was significantly improved compared with the DOX-CM group. The increased malondialdehyde and decreased superoxide dismutase were observed in the DOX-CM group, while a significant increase in superoxide dismutase and a decrease in malondialdehyde were detected in the groups treated with MaFGF-NP + UTMD. From the Masson staining, the MaFGF-NP + UTMD group showed a significant difference from the DOX-CM group. The cardiac collagen volume fraction and the ratio of the perivascular collagen area to the luminal area number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling positive cells in the MaFGF-NP + UTMD group decreased to 8.9%, 0.55-fold, compared with the DOX-CM group (26.5%, 1.7-fold). From terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling staining, the results showed the strongest inhibition of apoptosis progress in MaFGF-NP + UTMD group. The immunohistochemical staining of the TGF-\u03b21 in MaFGF-NP + UTMD group reached 3.6%, which was much lower than that of the DOX-CM group (12.6%). These results confirmed that the abnormalities, including left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocytes apoptosis and oxidative stress, could be suppressed by twice weekly MaFGF treatments for 6 consecutive weeks (free MaFGF or MaFGF-NP+/UTMD), with the strongest improvements observed in the MaFGF-NP + UTMD group. Western blot analyses of the heart tissue further revealed the highest pAkt levels, highest anti-apoptosis protein (Bcl-2) levels and strongest reduction in proapoptosis protein (Bax) levels in the MaFGF-NP + UTMD group.

All of the cadavers were embalmed in a formalin-based fixative solution. The tissue was processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at six micrometers, and stained with H&E. The microscope slides were evaluated by a board certified pathologist to determine whether the cellular components of the tissues were preserved at a high enough quality to allow for histopathologic diagnosis. There was a statistically significant relationship between ratings and organ groups. Across all organs, there was a smaller proportion of \"poor\" ratings. The lung group had the highest percentage of \"poor\" ratings (23.1%). The heart group had the least \"poor\" ratings (0.0%).

However, current patches fail to fully imitate the hierarchically aligned structure in the natural myocardium, the fast electrotonic propagation, and the subsequent synchronized contractions. Here, superaligned carbon-nanotube sheets (SA-CNTs) are explored to culture cardiomyocytes, mimicking the aligned structure and electrical-impulse transmission behavior of the natural myocardium. The SA-CNTs not only induce an elongated and aligned cell morphology of cultured cardiomyocytes, but also provide efficient extracellular signal-transmission pathways required for regular and synchronous cell contractions. Furthermore, the SA-CNTs can reduce the beat-to-beat and cell-to-cell dispersion in repolarization of cultured cells, which is essential for a normal beating rhythm, and potentially reduce the occurrence of arrhythmias. Finally, SA-CNT-based flexible one-piece electrodes demonstrate a multipoint pacing function.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of elevated endothelial TNAP on coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, we aimed to examine endogenous TNAP activity in human myocardium.\nA vascular pattern of TNAP activity was observed in human non-failing, ischemic, and idiopathic dilated hearts (5 per group); no differences were noted between groups in this study. Endothelial overexpression of TNAP was achieved in mice harboring a homozygous recessive mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor (whc allele) utilizing a Tie2-cre recombinase (WHC-eTNAP mice). WHC-eTNAP developed significant coronary artery calcification at baseline compared WHC controls (4312 vs 0\u03bcm2 alizarin red area, p<0.001). Eight weeks after induction of atherosclerosis, lipid deposition in the coronary arteries of WHC-eTNAP was increased compared to WHC controls (121633 vs 9330\u03bcm2 oil red O area, p<0.05).

{"title": "Cardiac Aging - Benefits of Exercise, Nrf2 Activation and Antioxidant Signaling.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular dysfunction and heart failure associated with aging not only impairs the cardiac function but also the quality of life eventually decreasing the life expectancy of the elderly. Notably, cardiac tissue can prematurely age under certain conditions such as genetic mutation, persistent redox stress and overload, aberrant molecular signaling, DNA damage, telomere attrition, and other pathological insults. While cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality is on the rise and remains a global health threat, there has been only little to moderate improvements in its medical management. This is due to the fact that the lifestyle changes to molecular mechanisms underlying age-related myocardial structure and functional remodeling are multifactorial and intricately operate at different levels. Along these lines, the intrinsic redox mechanisms and oxidative stress (OS) are widely studied in the myocardium. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with age and the resultant oxidative damage has been shown to increase the susceptibility of the myocardium to multiple complications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cardiac myopathy, and heart failure. There has been growing interest in trying to enhance the mechanisms that neutralize the ROS and curtailing OS as a possible anti-aging intervention and as a treatment for age-related disorders. Natural defense system to fight against OS involves a master transcription factor named nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) that regulates several antioxidant genes. Compelling evidence exists on the Nrf2 gain of function through pharmacological interventions in counteracting the oxidative damage and affords cytoprotection in several organs including but not limited to lung, liver, kidney, brain, etc. Nevertheless, thus far, only a few studies have described the potential role of Nrf2 and its non-pharmacological induction in cardiac aging.

Hence, novel biomarkers, such as fetal marker genes with low expression levels, could potentially differentiate disease states in order to improve therapy.

TTR-derived amyloid deposits were confirmed in the peroneus brevis muscle, salivary gland and heart tissue. DNA analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation in TTR.

{"title": "Regulating microRNA expression: at the heart of diabetes mellitus and the mitochondrion.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus results in a systemic milieu of increased circulating glucose and fatty acids. The development of insulin resistance in cardiac tissue decreases cellular glucose import and enhances mitochondrial fatty acid uptake. While triacylglycerol and cytotoxic lipid species begin to accumulate in the cardiomyocyte, the energy substrate utilization ratio of free fatty acids to glucose changes to almost entirely free fatty acids. Accumulating evidence suggests a role of miRNA in mediating this metabolic transition. Energy substrate metabolism, apoptosis, and the production and response to excess reactive oxygen species are regulated by miRNA expression. The current momentum for understanding the dynamics of miRNA expression is limited by a lack of understanding of how miRNA expression is controlled. While miRNAs are important regulators in both normal and pathological states, an additional layer of complexity is added when regulation of miRNA regulators is considered. miRNA expression is known to be regulated through a number of mechanisms, which include, but are not limited to, epigenetics, exosomal transport, processing, and posttranscriptional sequestration. The purpose of this review is to outline how mitochondrial processes are regulated by miRNAs in the diabetic heart.

Although accumulating evidences indicate that gene expression is regulated by hypoxia stress in fish, how genes undergoing differential gene expression and/or alternative splicing (AS) in response to hypoxia stress in heart are not well understood. Using RNA-seq, we surveyed and detected 289 differential expressed genes (DEG) and 103 genes that undergo differential usage of exons and splice junctions events (DUES) in heart of a hypoxia tolerant fish, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus following 12h hypoxic treatment. The spatio-temporal expression analysis validated the significant association of differential exon usages in two randomly selected DUES genes (fam162a and ndrg2) in 5 tissues (heart, liver, brain, gill and spleen) sampled at three time points (6h, 12h, and 24h) under acute hypoxia treatment. Functional analysis significantly associated the differential expressed genes with the categories related to energy conservation, protein synthesis and immune response. Different enrichment categories were found between the DEG and DUES dataset. The Isomerase activity, Oxidoreductase activity, Glycolysis and Oxidative stress process were significantly enriched for the DEG gene dataset, but the Structural constituent of ribosome and Structural molecule activity, Ribosomal protein and RNA binding protein were significantly enriched only for the DUES genes.

{"title": "The SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683, prevents Angiotensin II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "abstract": "Inflammation has emerged as a critical biological process contributing to hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Effective pharmacological treatments targeting the cardiac inflammatory response, however, are still lacking. Prior studies suggested that the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) plays a key role in inflammation and cardiac remodeling. Recently, a highly selective SGK1 inhibitor, EMD638683, was developed, though whether EMD638683 can prevent hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis and the mechanisms by which this inhibitor may alter the disease process remain unknown. Using a murine Angiotension II (Ang II) infusion-induced hypertension model we found that EMD638683 treatment inhibited cardiac fibrosis and remodeling, with significant abatement of cardiac inflammation. EMD638683 was shown to suppress Ang II infusion-induced interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 release, and substantially reduce nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) expression and caspase-1 activation in cardiac tissues. In vitro experiments revealed that EMD638683 ameliorated Ang II-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. By reducing IL-1\u03b2 production in macrophages, the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was inhibited. The effects of EMD638683 on cardiac fibrosis were abolished by supplementation with exogenous IL-1\u03b2. Administration of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 indicated that EMD638683 attenuated Ang II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis. These findings indicate that the SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683 can negatively regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and may represent a promising approach to the treatment of hypertensive cardiac damage.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Recent reports have identified S1P as a messenger mediating inflammation. However, roles of S1P in Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis were largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of S1P treatment on CVB3-induced myocarditis in vivo. We found that CVB3 infection downregulated S1PR1 expression in spleen and decreased the proportion of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) in CD3 positive T cells both in spleen and in blood from left ventricle, which accompanied by severe inflammation lesions and more virus capsid protein (VP1) expression in heart tissue. In comparison, S1P supply upregulated iNKT in the spleen and in blood from left ventricle, which represented the strengthening of anti-inflammatory effects. Indeed, inflammation infiltration, VP1 expression and apoptosis in the myocardium was all downregulated.

SVFs have cardiomyogenic potential, and many researchers have examined the possibility of SVF transplantation for heart disease. In cell-based therapies, donor age affects the regenerative capability, cell yield, and differentiation potential of adult tissues; however, opposing or controversial results have been found in humans. We examined whether SVF transplantation into impaired heart tissue shows differential effects according to donor age. Methods We investigated differences in protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with adipose-derived adherent stromal cells (ADASs) from donors of different ages [>40-year-olds (40s group) and >60-year-olds (60s group)] under oxidative stress conditions. Results Although co-culturing HUVECs with ADASs ameliorated inflammation due to increased oxidative stress conditions, few differences were observed between the ADASs from the 40s and 60s groups. Moreover, the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery classification tool revealed differentially expressed genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in response to ADASs.

{"title": "Myoblast transplantation improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction through attenuating inflammatory responses.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a highly prevalent cardiac emergency, which results in adverse cardiac remodeling and then exacerbates progressive heart failure. Inflammatory responses in cardiac tissue after MI is necessary for myocardium repair and wound healing. However, the excessive inflammation is also a key component of subsequent heart failure pathology. Myoblast transplantation after MI have been fulfilled attractive effects on cardiac repair, but the complications of transplantation and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that human myoblast transplantation into minipig myocardium decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the expression levels of many pro-inflammatory genes and the activation of inflammation-related signal pathways, while upregulated the expression levels of anti-inflammatory genes such as IL-10 in cardiac tissue of minipig post-MI, which was contributed to the improved cardiac function, the decreased infarct area and the attenuated myocardial fibrosis. Moreover, co-culture of human myoblasts inhibited the production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway induced by damage-associated molecular patterns such as HMGB1 and HSP60 in human THP-1 cells, which was partially attributed to the up-regulated production of IL-10.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is the third endogenous gas that has been shown to confer cardiac protective effects. Given the regulation of autophagy in cardioprotection, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of H2S via autophagy during high glucose treatment.\nThis study investigated the content of H2S in the plasma as well as myocardial, ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and autophagosomes. This study also investigated the apoptotic rate using Hoechst/PI as well as expression of autophagy-associated proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic proteins in H9C2 cells treated with or without GYY4137. Mitochondria of cardiac tissues were isolated and RCR and ADP/O were also detected. AMPK knockdown was performed with siRNA transfection.\nIn a STZ-induced diabetic model, NaHS treatment not only increased the expression of p-AMPK in diabetic group but further activated cell autophagy. Following 48h high glucose, autophagosomes and cell viability were reduced. The present results showed that autophagy could be induced by H2S, which was verified by autophagic ultrastructural observation and LC3-I/LC3-II conversion. In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was significantly decreased. The expressions levels of autophagic-related proteins were significantly elevated. Moreover, H2S activated the AMPK/rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway.\nOur findings demonstrated that H2S decreases oxidative stress and protects against mitochondria injury, activates autophagy, and eventually leads to cardiac protection via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2017-10-05", "authors": ["FanYang", "LinxueZhang", "ZhaopengGao", "XiaojiaoSun", "MiaoYu", "ShiyunDong", "JichaoWu", "YajunZhao", "ChangqingXu", "WeihuaZhang", "FanghaoLu"], "doi": "10.1159/000481758"}

Aside from addressing the physiological accuracy of the model tissues, there is a pressing need for improving the throughput of these platforms. To do so, scalable data acquisition strategies must be introduced. To this end, we here present an instrumented 24-well plate platform for higher-throughput studies of engineered human stem cell-derived cardiac muscle tissues that recapitulate the laminar structure of the native ventricle. In each well of the platform, an embedded flexible strain gauge provides continuous and non-invasive readout of the contractile stress and beat rate of an engineered cardiac tissue. The sensors are based on micro-cracked titanium-gold thin films, which ensure that the sensors are highly compliant and robust. We demonstrate the value of the platform for toxicology and drug-testing purposes by performing 12 complete dose-response studies of cardiac and cardiotoxic drugs. Additionally, we showcase the ability to couple the cardiac tissues with endothelial barriers. In these studies, which mimic the passage of drugs through the blood vessels to the musculature of the heart, we regulate the temporal onset of cardiac drug responses by modulating endothelial barrier permeability in vitro.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-10-05", "authors": ["Johan ULind", "MoranYadid", "IanPerkins", "Blakely BO'Connor", "FeyisayoEweje", "Christophe OChantre", "Matthew AHemphill", "HongyanYuan", "Patrick HCampbell", "Joost JVlassak", "Kevin KParker"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc00740j"}

The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the heart tissues and serum was evaluated and the activity of enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was estimated in the heart tissues. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in heart tissues was also measured. The Total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was measured in the serum of the entire animals group. The results of present study showed that the activity of LDH in heart tissues were decreased and in serum was elevated. The MDA level was significantly elevated due to exposure of carbofuran. The enzymatic antioxidants, SOD and CAT activities were also inhibited. The ratio of pro-oxidant (P)/antioxidant (A) was also found to be sharply increased in the rat heart tissues of carbofuran exposed animals.

The use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is promising for this purpose. However, single hiPSC-CMs are limited in their ability to mimic native cardiac tissue structurally and functionally, and the generation of artificial cardiac tissue using hiPSC-CMs is an ongoing challenging. We therefore developed a new method of constructing three-dimensional (3D) artificial tissues in a short time by coating extracellular matrix (ECM) components on cell surfaces. We hypothesized that 3D cardiac tissues derived from hiPSC-CMs (3D-hiPSC-CT) could be used for an in vitro drug-induced cardiotoxicity assay. 3D-hiPSC-CT were generated by fibronectin and gelatin nanofilm coated single hiPSC-CMs. Histologically, 3D-hiPSC-CT exhibited a sarcomere structure in the myocytes and ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, collagen type I/III, and laminin. The administration of cytotoxic doxorubicin at 5.0\u2009\u03bcM induced the release of lactate dehydrogenase, while that at 2.0\u2009\u03bcM reduced the cell viability. E-4031, human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-type potassium channel blocker, and isoproterenol induced significant changes both in the Ca transient parameters and contractile parameters in a dose-dependent manner. The 3D-hiPSC-CT exhibited doxorubicin-sensitive cytotoxicity and hERG channel blocker/isoproterenol-sensitive electrical activity in vitro, indicating its usefulness for drug-induced cardiotoxicity assays or drug screening systems for drug discovery.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Of all mammal species, pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps) present the greatest known prevalence of cardiomyopathy with more than half of examined individuals indicating the presence of cardiomyopathy from gross and histo-pathology. Several factors such as genetics, infectious agents, contaminants, biotoxins, and inappropriate dietary intake (vitamins, selenium, mercury, and pro-oxidants), may contribute to the development of idiopathic cardiomyopathy in K. breviceps. Due to the important role Se can play in antioxidant biochemistry and protein formation, Se protein presence and relative abundance were explored in cardiomyopathy related cases. Selenium proteins were separated and detected by multi-dimension liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS), Se protein identification was performed by liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), and Se protein profiles were examined in liver (n=30) and heart tissue (n=5) by SEC/UV/ICP-MS detection. Data collected on selenium proteins was evaluated in the context of individual animal trace element concentration, life history, and histological information. Selenium containing protein peak profiles varied in presence and intensity between animals with no pathological findings of cardiomyopathy and animals exhibiting evidence of cardiomyopathy. In particular, one class of proteins, metallothioneins, was found to be associated with Se and was in greater abundance in animals with cardiomyopathy than those with no pathological findings.

{"title": "Modeling dynamics in diseased cardiac tissue: Impact of model choice.", "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias have been traditionally simulated using continuous models that assume tissue homogeneity and use a relatively large spatial discretization. However, it is believed that the tissue fibrosis and collagen deposition, which occur on a micron-level, are critical factors in arrhythmogenesis in diseased tissues. Consequently, it remains unclear how well continuous models, which use averaged electrical properties, are able to accurately capture complex conduction behaviors such as re-entry in fibrotic tissues. The objective of this study was to compare re-entrant behavior in discrete microstructural models of fibrosis and in two types of equivalent continuous models, a homogenous continuous model and a hybrid continuous model with distinct heterogeneities. In the discrete model, increasing levels of tissue fibrosis lead to a substantial increase in the re-entrant cycle length which is inadequately reflected in the homogenous continuous models. These cycle length increases appear to be primarily due to increases in the tip path length and to altered restitution behavior, and suggest that it is critical to consider the discrete effects of fibrosis on conduction when studying arrhythmogenesis in fibrotic myocardium. Hybrid models are able to accurately capture some aspects of re-entry and, if carefully tuned, may provide a framework for simulating conduction in diseased tissues with both accuracy and efficiency.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2017-10-02", "authors": ["Tanmay AGokhale", "EliMedvescek", "Craig SHenriquez"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4999605\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.158101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.238302\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2002.01141.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2003\n10.1007/s11538-013-9927-1\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0352\n10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2003\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2292320\n10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090059\n10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627817\n10.1161/CIRCEP.109.890459\n10.22489/CinC.2016.052-487\n10.1007/s11538-009-9421-y\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2310515\n10.1152/ajpheart.00385.2013\n10.1093/europace/eum203\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.026\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1161/hc5001.100833\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2013.11.003\n10.1001/jama.2014.3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0117110\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.009\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2012.08.005\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.05.025\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.12.012\n10.1085/jgp.104.2.287\n10.1161/01.RES.62.4.811\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.023\n10.1161/01.RES.48.1.39\n10.1007/s10439-010-0100-9\n10.1007/s10439-009-9883-y\n10.1007/s11517-012-0934-4\n10.1093/europace/eum206\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.03.019\n10.1152/ajpheart.01376.2007\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvw073"}
{"title": "Effects of model error on cardiac electrical wave state reconstruction using data assimilation.", "abstract": "Reentrant electrical scroll waves have been shown to underlie many cardiac arrhythmias, but the inability to observe locations away from the heart surfaces and the restriction of observations to only one or two state variables have made understanding arrhythmia mechanisms challenging. Recently, we showed that data assimilation from spatiotemporally sparse surrogate observations could be used to reconstruct a reliable time series of state estimates of reentrant cardiac electrical waves including unobserved variables in one and three spatial dimensions. However, real cardiac tissue is unlikely to be described accurately by mathematical models because of errors in model formulation and parameterization as well as intrinsic but poorly described spatial heterogeneity of electrophysiological properties in the heart. Here, we extend our previous work to assess how model error affects the accuracy of cardiac state estimates achieved using data assimilation with the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter. We focus on one-dimensional states of discordant alternans characterized by significant wavelength oscillations. We demonstrate that data assimilation can provide high-quality estimates under a wide range of model error conditions, ranging from varying one or more parameter values to using an entirely different model to generate the truth state. We illustrate how multiplicative and additive inflation can be used to reduce error in the state estimates. Even when the truth state contains underlying spatial heterogeneity, we show that using a homogeneous model in the data assimilation algorithm can achieve good results. Overall, we find data assimilation to be a robust approach for reconstructing complex cardiac electrical states corresponding to arrhythmias even in the presence of model error.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2017-10-02", "authors": ["Nicholas SLaVigne", "NathanHolt", "Matthew JHoffman", "Elizabeth MCherry"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4999603"}
{"title": "Ephaptic coupling rescues conduction failure in weakly coupled cardiac tissue with voltage-gated gap junctions.", "abstract": "Electrical conduction in cardiac tissue is usually considered to be primarily facilitated by gap junctions, providing a pathway between the intracellular spaces of neighboring cells. However, recent studies have highlighted the role of coupling via extracellular electric fields, also known as ephaptic coupling, particularly in the setting of reduced gap junction expression. Further, in the setting of reduced gap junctional coupling, voltage-dependent gating of gap junctions, an oft-neglected biophysical property in computational studies, produces a positive feedback that promotes conduction failure. We hypothesized that ephaptic coupling can break the positive feedback loop and rescue conduction failure in weakly coupled cardiac tissue. In a computational tissue model incorporating voltage-gated gap junctions and ephaptic coupling, we demonstrate that ephaptic coupling can rescue conduction failure in weakly coupled tissue. Further, ephaptic coupling increased conduction velocity in weakly coupled tissue, and importantly, reduced the minimum gap junctional coupling necessary for conduction, most prominently at fast pacing rates. Finally, we find that, although neglecting gap junction voltage-gating results in negligible differences in well coupled tissue, more significant differences occur in weakly coupled tissue, greatly underestimating the minimal gap junctional coupling that can maintain conduction. Our study suggests that ephaptic coupling plays a conduction-preserving role, particularly at rapid heart rates.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2017-10-02", "authors": ["S HWeinberg"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4999602"}
{"title": "Modeling bipolar stimulation of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Unipolar stimulation of cardiac tissue is often used in the design of cardiac pacemakers because of the low current required to depolarize the surrounding tissue at rest. However, the advantages of unipolar over bipolar stimulation are not obvious at shorter coupling intervals when the tissue near the pacing electrode is relatively refractory. Therefore, this paper analyzes bipolar stimulation of cardiac tissue. The strength-interval relationship for bipolar stimulation is calculated using the bidomain model and a recently developed parsimonious ionic current model. The strength-interval curves obtained using different electrode separations and arrangements (electrodes placed parallel to the fibers versus perpendicular to the fibers) indicate that bipolar stimulation results in more complex activation patterns compared to unipolar stimulation. An unusually low threshold stimulus current is observed when the electrodes are close to each other (a separation of 1\u2009mm) because of break excitation. Unlike for unipolar stimulation, anode make excitation is not present during bipolar stimulation, and an abrupt switch from anode break to cathode make excitation can cause dramatic changes in threshold with very small changes in the interval.

Recent evidence suggests the persistent nature of this injury is caused by altered regulation of genes important to normal cardiac functioning. We hypothesize that chronic DOX therapy is associated with epigenetic modifications of DNA methylation status, particularly in critical regulators of mitochondrial function and capacity. Cardiac tissue from Sprague Dawley rats receiving injections of DOX (2\u2009mg/kg, s.c.) or saline once a week for 6\u2009weeks, followed by 5\u2009weeks of drug-free holiday was used for Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to map specific sites of DNA methylation. Comparison of these methylomes indicated DOX exposure alters DNA methylation landscapes, and identified 14 genes with highly altered methylation status. Preliminary functional effects of DNA methylation changes were characterized by quantifying mRNA expression of selected targets (Rbm20, Nmnat2, Klhl29, Cacna1c, Scn5a.) Gene expression of Rbm20, Klhl29, and Nmnat2 were significantly altered in DOX treated animals; Klhl29 and Nmnat2 demonstrated significant decreases in protein expression corresponding to gene expression. Through an epigenotype-to-phenotype approach, this study identifies potential markers and molecular regulators of irreversible DOX-induced cardiovascular toxicity associated with clinically limiting CHF. However, none of the most prevalent genes identified directly relate to mitochondrial structure or function. Thus, the investigation fails to demonstrate a direct association between this altered methylome and persistent mitochondrionopathy associated with chronic doxorubicin cardiac toxicity.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2017-10-01", "authors": ["Kendra K SNordgren", "MarshallHampton", "Kendall BWallace"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfx150"}

We aimed to comprehend whether melatonin intravenous injection supports the oxidative/antioxidative conditions and energy charge in heart tissues of rats exposed to acute swimming exercise.\nThirty Wistar-albino male rats were categorized into 3 groups with equal number of subjects. Control group performed no application, and acute intensive swimming exercise group were subjected to acute intensive swimming exercise for 30 minutes, and melatonin group were applied 25 mg/kg single dose melatonin administration prior to 30 minutes acute intensive swimming exercise. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured by spectrophotometric method; and the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and energy charge were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography.\nTissue MDA and 3-NT levels of the acute intensive exercise group were found to be higher than the control group. It was also found that the melatonin administration increased the energy charge and antioxidant activities, while decreased tissue MDA and 3-NT levels in heart tissues. Our results provide evidence for melatonin that can exert potent protective effects on oxidative stress and energy charge for heart tissues in acute swimming exercise.\nThese findings suggest that the direct beneficial effects of melatonin could be potentially applied on prevention of oxidative stress and energy deficit.", "journal": "Acta Cardiologica Sinica", "date": "2017-09-30", "authors": ["BehzatCimen", "AliUz", "IhsanCetin", "LeylaCimen", "AysunCetin"], "doi": "10.6515/acs20170331a"}
{"title": "Osteoglycin prevents the development of age-related diastolic dysfunction during pressure overload by reducing cardiac fibrosis and inflammation.", "abstract": "The small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin has been implicated in matrix homeostasis in different organs, including the ischemic heart. However, whether osteoglycin modulates cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis or inflammation in hypertensive heart disease and during aging remains unknown. Angiotensin-II-induced pressure overload increases cardiac osteoglycin expression, concomitant with the onset of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition. Interestingly aging led to decreased cardiac levels of osteoglycin, yet absence of osteoglycin did not affect organ structure or cardiac function up to the age of 18months. However, Angiotensin-II infusion in combination with aging resulted in exaggerated cardiac fibrosis and inflammation in the osteoglycin null mice as compared to wild-type mice, resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro, stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophages from osteoglycin null mice with Angiotensin-II resulted in significantly higher levels of ICAM-1 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 as compared to WT cells. Further, stimulation of human cardiac fibroblasts with osteoglycin reduced cell proliferation and inhibited TGF-\u03b2 induced collagen gene expression. In mouse cardiac tissue, osteoglycin expression inversely correlated with TGF-\u03b2 expression and in cardiac biopsies of aortic stenosis patients, osteoglycin expression is significantly higher than in control biopsies. Interestingly, osteoglycin levels were higher in patients with less severe myocardial fibrosis and overall in the aortic stenosis patients osteoglycin levels negatively correlated with collagen content in the myocardium. In conclusion, osteoglycin expression is increased in the heart in response to pressure overload and its absence results in increased cardiac inflammation and fibrosis resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction.", "journal": "Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "date": "2017-09-30", "authors": ["SophieDeckx", "WardHeggermont", "PaoloCarai", "MariekeRienks", "TomDresselaers", "UweHimmelreich", "Rickvan Leeuwen", "WiesLommen", "Jolandavan der Velden", "ArantxaGonzalez", "JavierDiez", "Anna-PiaPapageorgiou", "StephaneHeymans"], "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2017.09.002"}

{"title": "Development of next generation cardiovascular therapeutics through bio-assisted nanotechnology.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) rank, next to cancer and stroke, among the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the major CVDs, acute myocardial infarction is a life-threatening disorder resulting from permanent damage to the left ventricular cardiac tissue. The major coronary arteries that supply blood to the functional left ventricle become blocked due to thrombotic plaque occlusion. During myocardial ischemia, oxidative stress and free radicals destroy healthy cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, followed by degradation of the extracellular matrix, which results in ventricular wall-thinning and dilation. To protect the left ventricle from further damage and to rescue ischemic cardiac tissue, specially designed scaffolds consisting of biological material and nanomaterials have been developed. At the preclinical level, scaffolds loaded with growth factors and cells have been shown to regenerate ischemic tissue into healthy, functional myocardium. In this review, different therapeutic strategies currently available to treat the disease conditions at various stages are discussed, with special emphasis on biomaterials. Recent advancements in cardiovascular therapeutics using graphene and exosomal nanovesicles are discussed in detail.

Gross pathology and histology of the heart with particular attention to the lead tracts were performed.\nAll leads were successfully removed in their entirety and required significantly less than 1\u00a0kg of traction force. The side helix disengaged from the vein as designed and resulted in no complications. No cardiac tissue was observed on any extracted lead. Gross pathology and histology were devoid of any helix-induced lesions in the vascular structures. The epicardium over the side helix was normal and the fibrotic reaction around the helix was not significantly different from that around the nonhelix portions of the study leads or the control lead.\nExtraction of the side helix, active fixation LV lead from the coronary veins in the sheep model is safe, without procedural complexity, and free of complications after long-term LV lead implant duration.", "journal": "Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE", "date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["StuartAdler", "NicoleKirchhof", "Amy EThompson", "LaurieFoerster", "Kyle RMarquard", "Douglas SHine"], "doi": "10.1111/pace.13200"}

Also, our group showed that a single bout of resistance exercise (RE) activates the AKT/mTOR which was also inhibited by AT1R blocker. Here, we investigated whether IGF1-receptor (IGF1-R) and MAPKs were also activated after a single bout of RE. Wistar rats were divided into Sedentary (Sed), Sedentary treated with losartan (Sed+LOS), Exercise (EX), and Exercise treated with losartan (EX+LOS). Cardiac tissue was obtained 5 and 30 min after 4 sets of 12 repetitions of squat exercise (80 % 1RM). We demonstrated that a single bout of RE did not induce IGF1-R tyrosine phosphorylation. ERK1/2 and P38 phosphorylation levels were elevated in the EX 5min and EX 30min groups however, only ERK1/2 was inhibited by losartan treatment (AT1R blocker). Next, we showed that beta-arrestin-2 expression increased 28 % in trained animals compared to sedentary group. Altogether, our results demonstrate that AT1R, but not IGF1-R, may exert the hypertrophic cardiac stimulus RE-induced. Also, activation of AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways may occur through the beta-arrestin-dependent pathway.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["S FsMelo", "V GBarauna", "TFernandes", "E CCarmo", "C RoCarvalho", "E MOliveira"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.933563"}
{"title": "Microfibrous Scaffolds Enhance Endothelial Differentiation and Organization of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising source of endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) for engineering three-dimensional (3D) vascularized cardiac tissues. To mimic cardiac microvasculature, in which capillaries are oriented in parallel, we hypothesized that endothelial differentiation of iPSCs within topographically aligned 3D scaffolds would be a facile one-step approach to generate iPSC-ECs as well as induce aligned vascular organization.\nHuman iPSCs underwent endothelial differentiation within electrospun 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds having either randomly oriented or parallel-aligned microfibers. Using transcriptional, protein, and endothelial functional assays, endothelial differentiation was compared between conventional two-dimensional (2D) films and 3D scaffolds having either randomly oriented or aligned microfibers. Furthermore, the role of parallel-aligned microfiber patterning on the organization of vessel-like networks was assessed.\nThe cells in both the randomly oriented and aligned 3D scaffolds demonstrated an 11-fold upregulation in gene expression of the endothelial phenotypic marker, CD31, compared to cells on 2D films. This upregulation corresponded to >3-fold increase in CD31 protein expression in 3D scaffolds, compared to 2D films. Concomitantly, other endothelial phenotypic markers including CD144 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase also showed significant transcriptional upregulation in 3D scaffolds by >7-fold, compared to 2D films. Nitric oxide production, which is characteristic of endothelial function, was produced 4-fold more abundantly in 3D scaffolds, compared to on 2D PCL films. Within aligned scaffolds, the iPSC-ECs displayed parallel-aligned vascular-like networks with 70% longer branch length, compared to cells in randomly oriented scaffolds, suggesting that fiber topography modulates vascular network-like formation and patterning.\nTogether, these results demonstrate that 3D scaffold structure promotes endothelial differentiation, compared to 2D substrates, and that aligned topographical patterning induces anisotropic vascular network organization.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular bioengineering", "date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["Joseph JKim", "LuqiaHou", "GuangYang", "Nicholas PMezak", "MaureenWanjare", "Lydia MJoubert", "Ngan FHuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s12195-017-0502-y\n10.1002/jbm.a.35551\n10.1161/01.RES.0000255691.76142.4a\n10.1163/156856208784089643\n10.1242/jcs.079509\n10.1080/10739680590904964\n10.1089/scd.2012.0376\n10.1186/s12860-015-0067-3\n10.1073/pnas.0430082100\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.09.064\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000115644.35804.8B\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1038/nmat3777\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.gde.2013.06.003\n10.1038/288373a0\n10.1002/term.1642\n10.1136/hrt.45.3.248\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.010\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2457\n10.1089/scd.2009.0417\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.036\n10.1021/nl060060o\n10.1126/science.1063127\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.025\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.006\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100109-104042\n10.1002/term.1978\n10.1038/nature12298\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19991102)38:21<3209::AID-ANIE3209>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1073/pnas.1306562110\n10.1016/j.ceb.2016.04.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.016\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2093\n10.1007/s10544-006-6380-z\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.005\n10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0153\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1002/adhm.201600141\n10.1056/NEJM199312303292706\n10.1021/acsnano.5b00545\n10.2217/rme.15.45\n10.1038/ncb3205\n10.1039/C5TB02745D\n10.7150/ijms.8895\n10.1002/jbm.a.30871\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.034\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1038/jid.2013.481\n10.1371/journal.pone.0157214\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.12.032\n10.1038/srep09718\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.046\n10.1242/jcs.03314\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.037\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.02.014"}

Female NZB/W F1 mice, a well-known and commonly used lupus-prone mouse strain, were treated with or without GMNL-32 administration for 12 weeks. Oral administration of GMNL-32 to NZB/WF1 mice significantly increased the ventricular thickness when compared to that of NZB/WF1 mice. Administration of GMNL-32 significantly attenuated the cardiac cell apoptosis that was observed in exacerbate levels in the control NZB/WF1 mice. Further, the cellular morphology that was slightly distorted in the NZB/WF1 was effectively alleviated in the treatment group mice. In addition, GMNL-32 reduced the level of Fas death receptor-related pathway of apoptosis signaling and enhanced anti-apoptotic proteins.

Although one method for detecting myocardial ischaemia involves changes in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram, the relationship between these changes and subendocardial ischaemia is not fully understood. In this study, we modelled ST-segment epicardial potentials in a slab model of cardiac ventricular tissue, with a central ischaemic region, using the bidomain model, which considers conduction longitudinal, transverse and normal to the cardiac fibres. We systematically quantified the effect of uncertainty on the input parameters, fibre rotation angle, ischaemic depth, blood conductivity and six bidomain conductivities, on outputs that characterise the epicardial potential distribution. We found that three typical types of epicardial potential distributions (one minimum over the central ischaemic region, a tripole of minima, and two minima flanking a central maximum) could all occur for a wide range of ischaemic depths. In addition, the positions of the minima were affected by both the fibre rotation angle and the ischaemic depth, but not by changes in the conductivity values.

In the present study, the electrical activity in the cardiac tissue of the rat azygos vein (AZV) was investigated for the first time. The atrial-like action potentials (AP) and atrial-like conduction of the excitation were observed in the rat AZV under continuous electrical pacing. Termination of electrical pacing resulted in spontaneous positive shift of resting membrane potential (RMP) in AZV.

The clinical use of this broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent is restricted due to development of severe form of cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and genotoxicity which interfere with therapeutic schedule, compromise treatment outcome and may lead to secondary malignancy. 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid formed by the hydrolysis of indolylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the protective role of DIM against DOX-induced toxicity in mice. DOX was administered (5\u2009mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and DIM was administered (25\u2009mg/kg b.w., p.o.) in concomitant and 15 days pretreatment schedule. Results showed that DIM significantly attenuated DOX-induced oxidative stress in the cardiac tissues by reducing the levels of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, and by enhancing the level of glutathione (reduced) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The chemoprotective potential of DIM was confirmed by histopathological evaluation of heart and bone marrow niche. Moreover, DIM considerably mitigated DOX-induced clastogenicity, DNA damage, apoptosis, and myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow niche. In addition, oral administration of DIM significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.05) stimulated the Nrf2-mediated activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and promoted expression of ARE-driven cytoprotective proteins, HO-1, NQO1, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In connection with that, DIM significantly attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis by upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and downregulation of Bax and caspase-3 expression. Thus, this study suggests that DIM has promising chemoprotective efficacy against DOX-induced toxicity and indicates its future use as an adjuvant in chemotherapy.", "journal": "Free radical research", "date": "2017-09-20", "authors": ["SubhadipHajra", "AbhishekBasu", "SomnathSingha Roy", "Arup RanjanPatra", "SudinBhattacharya"], "doi": "10.1080/10715762.2017.1381694"}

However, the key drivers of this process remain poorly defined. We are currently unable to recapitulate postnatal maturation in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), limiting their potential as a model system to discover regenerative therapeutics. Here, we provide a summary of our studies, where we developed a 96-well device for functional screening in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac organoids (hCOs). Through interrogation of >10,000 organoids, we systematically optimize parameters, including extracellular matrix (ECM), metabolic substrate, and growth factor conditions, that enhance cardiac tissue viability, function, and maturation. Under optimized maturation conditions, functional and molecular characterization revealed that a switch to fatty acid metabolism was a central driver of cardiac maturation. Under these conditions, hPSC-CMs were refractory to mitogenic stimuli, and we found that key proliferation pathways including \u03b2-catenin and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) were repressed. This proliferative barrier imposed by fatty acid metabolism in hCOs could be rescued by simultaneous activation of both \u03b2-catenin and YAP1 using genetic approaches or a small molecule activating both pathways.

In this study, we compared the reversal effects of levosimendan, epinephrine, and a combination of the two agents in lipid-based resuscitation in a rat model of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest.\nFifty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to bupivacaine (15\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\nThe rates of ROSC in LiEL and LiE groups were higher than LiL group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; LiEL vs LiL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; LiE vs LiL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The survival rate in LiEL group was higher than LiE group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003; LiEL vs LiE, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008; LiEL vs LiL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

{"title": "Dual inhibition of cathepsin G and chymase reduces myocyte death and improves cardiac remodeling after myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Early reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissue increases inflammatory cell infiltration which contributes to cardiomyocyte death and loss of cardiac function, referred to as ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Neutrophil- and mast cell-derived proteases, cathepsin G (Cat.G) and chymase, are released early after IR, but their function is complicated by potentially redundant actions and targets. This study investigated whether a dual inhibition of Cat.G and chymase influences cardiomyocyte injury and wound healing after experimental IR in mice. Treatment with a dual Cat.G and chymase inhibitor (DCCI) immediately after reperfusion blocked cardiac Cat.G and chymase activity induced after IR, which resulted in decreased immune response in the infarcted heart. Mice treated with DCCI had less myocardial collagen deposition and showed preserved ventricular function at 1 and 7\u00a0days post-IR compared with vehicle-treated mice. DCCI treatment also significantly attenuated focal adhesion (FA) complex disruption and myocyte degeneration after IR. Treatment of isolated cardiomyocytes with Cat.G or chymase significantly promoted FA signaling downregulation, myofibril degeneration and myocyte apoptosis. Conversely, treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with Cat.G or chymase induced FA signaling activation and increased their migration and differentiation to myofibroblasts. These opposite responses in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were blocked by treatment with DCCI. These findings show that Cat.G and chymase are key mediators of myocyte apoptosis and fibroblast migration and differentiation that play a role in adverse cardiac remodeling and function post-IR. Thus, dual targeting of neutrophil- and mast cell-derived proteases could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce post-IR inflammation and improve cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2017-09-16", "authors": ["BahmanHooshdaran", "Mikhail AKolpakov", "XinjiGuo", "Sonni AMiller", "TaoWang", "Douglas GTilley", "KhadijaRafiq", "AbdelkarimSabri"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-017-0652-z\n10.3389/fimmu.2011.00037\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.04.045\n10.1172/JCI8768\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.019\n10.1021/ja017506h\n10.1161/01.cir.100.13.1443\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw224\n10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60107-0\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01591-1\n10.1161/01.ATV.15.11.2037\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00535-2\n10.1007/s00395-014-0444-7\n10.1291/hypres.29.57\n10.1136/jcp.55.11.801\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1866\n10.1093/cvr/cvq272\n10.1016/S0196-9781(97)00011-9\n10.1096/fj.00-0273com\n10.1007/s10741-007-9073-7\n10.1164/rccm.200904-0627OC\n10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834115d1\n10.1161/01.cir.0000046449.36178.00\n10.1152/physrev.00024.2007\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000163262.83456.6d\n10.1124/jpet.111.179697\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.921619\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.150573\n10.1074/jbc.M513040200\n10.1074/jbc.M302718200\n10.1034/j.1600-065X.2000.17706.x\n10.1186/1476-9255-7-45\n10.1074/jbc.M410396200\n10.1161/circresaha.115.306565\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1161/circresaha.113.300765\n10.1111/j.1365-2796.2005.01476.x\n10.1158/1541-7786.mcr-09-0028\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1007/s11010-007-9676-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094732"}

Profilin\u20111, a ubiquitously expressed and multifunctional actin\u2011binding protein, has been reported to be an important mediator in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. However, whether profilin\u20111 is involved in AGE\u2011induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis remains to be determined. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the function of profilin\u20111 in cardiac injury induced by AGEs. The model of cardiac injury was established by chronic tail vein injection of AGEs (50\u00a0mg/kg/day for 8\u00a0weeks) in Sprague\u2011Dawley rats. Rats were randomly assigned to control, AGEs, AGEs\u00a0+\u00a0profilin\u20111 shRNA adenovirus vectors (AGEs\u00a0+\u00a0S)or AGEs\u00a0+\u00a0control adenovirus vectors (AGEs\u00a0+\u00a0V) groups. Profilin\u20111 shRNA adenovirus vectors were injected via the tail vein to knockdown profilin\u20111 expression at a dose of 3x109\u00a0plaque forming units every 4\u00a0weeks. Echocardiography was performed to measure cardiac contractile function. Cardiac tissues were stained with Masson's trichrome stain to evaluate ventricular remodeling. The serum levels of procollagen type\u00a0III N\u2011terminal peptide were detected by ELISA. The expression of profilin\u20111, receptor for AGEs (RAGE), Rho, p65, atrial natriuretic peptide, \u03b2\u2011myosin heavy chain, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)\u20112 and MMP\u20119 were determined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) and/or western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. The results demonstrated that chronic injection of exogenous AGEs led to cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy and fibrosis, as determined by echocardiography, Masson trichrome staining and the expression of associated genes. The expression of profilin\u20111 was markedly increased in heart tissue at the mRNA and protein level following AGE administration, as determined by RT\u2011qPCR and western blotting, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining. Furthermore, the expression of RAGE, Rho and p65 was also increased at the protein level. Notably, knockdown of profilin\u20111 expression ameliorated AGE\u2011induced cardiac injury and reduced the expression of RAGE, Rho and p65.

To explain the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of NDEE, we evaluated the redox-sensitivity of NDEE in ISP-induced cardiac injury. The oral administration of NDEE (50 and 100\u202fmg/kg b.w) prevented the depletion of endogenous antioxidants (CAT, SOD, NP-SH, and NO) and myocyte injury marker enzymes and inhibited lipid peroxidation (MDA, MPO). Moreover, NDEE downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10) and apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and Bax) and upregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. Furthermore, NDEE pretreatment significantly downregulated cardiac NF-\u03baB (p65) expression, NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activity, and MPO activity.

The present study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the arrhythmogenic potential of TRPM4.\nPatch clamp and biochemical analyses were performed using expression system and an immortalized atrial cardiomyocyte cell line (HL-1), and numerical model simulation was employed. After rapid desensitization, robust reactivation of TRPM4 channels required high micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. However, upon evaluation with a newly devised, ionomycin-permeabilized cell-attached (Iono-C/A) recording technique, submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (apparent Kd =\u2009\u223c500\u2009nM) were enough to activate this channel. Similar submicromolar Ca2+ dependency was also observed with sharp electrode whole-cell recording and in experiments coexpressing TRPM4 and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Numerical simulations using a number of action potential (AP) models (HL-1, Nygren, Luo-Rudy) incorporating the Ca2+- and voltage-dependent gating parameters of TRPM4, as assessed by Iono-C/A recording, indicated that a few-fold increase in TRPM4 activity is sufficient to delay late AP repolarization and further increases (\u2265\u2009six-fold) evoke early afterdepolarization. These model predictions are consistent with electrophysiological data from angiotensin II-treated HL-1 cells in which TRPM4 expression and activity were enhanced.\nThese results collectively indicate that the TRPM4 channel is activated by a physiological range of Ca2+ concentrations and its excessive activity can cause arrhythmic changes. Moreover, these results demonstrate potential utility of the first AP models incorporating TRPM4 gating for in silico assessment of arrhythmogenicity in remodelling cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["YaopengHu", "YubinDuan", "AyakoTakeuchi", "LinHai-Kurahara", "JunIchikawa", "KeizoHiraishi", "TomohiroNumata", "HirokiOhara", "GentaroIribe", "MichioNakaya", "Masayuki XMori", "SatoshiMatsuoka", "GenshanMa", "RyujiInoue"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvx117"}

However, specific mechanisms that lead to ECM-mediated cardiac regeneration are not well understood. To elucidate the potential mechanisms, we investigated ultra-structures of the cardiac ECM using electron microscopy. Intriguingly, we observed large quantities of micro-vesicles from decellularized right atria. RNA and protein analyses revealed that these contained exosomal proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs), which we referred to herein as ECM-derived extracellular vesicles (ECM-EVs). One particular miRNA from ECM-EVs, miR-199a-3p, promoted cell growth of isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes and sinus nodal cells by repressing homeodomain-only protein (HOPX) expression and increasing GATA-binding 4 (Gata4) acetylation. To determine the mechanisms, we knocked down Gata4 and showed that miR-199a-3p actions required Gata4 for cell proliferation in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes and sinus nodal cells. To further explore the role of this miRNA, we isolated neonatal cardiac cells and recellularized into atrial ECM, referred here has engineered atria. Remarkably, miR-199a-3p mediated the enrichment of cardiomyocyte and sinus nodal cell population, and enhanced electrocardiographic signal activity of sinus nodal cells in the engineered atria. Importantly, antisense of miRNA (antagomir) against miR-199a-3p was capable of abolishing these actions of miR-199a-3p in the engineered atria. We further showed in Ang II-infused animal model of sinus nodal dysfunction that miR-199-3p-treated cardiac cells remarkably ameliorated and restored the electrical activity as shown by normalization of the ECG, in contrast to untreated cells, which did not show electrical recovery.

This unique morphological feature enables telocytes to be recognized from other interstitial cells such as fibroblasts. Additional observations include the ability to release extracellular vesicles and to make contacts with other structures such as endothelial cells, suggesting a role in intercellular communication.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2017-09-09", "authors": ["HTay", "TVandecasteele", "WVan den Broeck"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12296"}

The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the cell type specificity of telomere shortening in patients with heart failure in relation to their cardiac disease, age, and sex.\nWe studied cardiac tissues from patients with heart failure by utilizing telomere quantitative fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization, a highly sensitive method with single-cell resolution. In this study, total of 63 human left ventricular samples, including 37 diseased and 26 nonfailing donor hearts, were stained for telomeres in combination with cardiomyocyte- or \u03b1-smooth muscle cell-specific markers, cardiac troponin T, and smooth muscle actin, respectively, and assessed for telomere length. Patients with heart failure demonstrate shorter cardiomyocyte telomeres compared with nonfailing donors, which is specific only to cardiomyocytes within diseased human hearts and is associated with cardiomyocyte DNA damage. Our data further reveal that hypertrophic hearts with reduced ejection fraction exhibit the shortest telomeres. In contrast to other reported cell types, no difference in cardiomyocyte telomere length is evident with age. However, under the disease state, telomere attrition manifests in both young and older patients with cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte-telomere length is better sustained in women than men under diseased conditions.\nThis study provides the first evidence of cardiomyocyte-specific telomere shortening in heart failure.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2017-09-09", "authors": ["MaryamSharifi-Sanjani", "Nicholas MOyster", "Elisia DTichy", "Kenneth CBedi", "OferHarel", "Kenneth BMargulies", "FoteiniMourkioti"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.116.005086"}

Methionine obtained from the diet participates in the synthesis of DNA, proteins, lipids and affects homocysteine levels, which is associated with the elevated risk for CVD development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the manner in which dietary methionine might affect cellular mechanisms underlying CVD occurrence. Swiss albino mice were fed either control (0.3% DL-methionine), methionine-supplemented (2% DL-methionine), or a methionine-deprived diet (0% DL-methionine) over a 10-week period. The parameters measured included plasma homocysteine concentrations, oxidative stress by reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, as well as expression of genes associated with CVD. The levels of apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5), a regulator of plasma triglycerides, were measured. The methionine-supplemented diet increased oxidative stress by lowering the GSH/GSSG ratio in heart tissues and decreased expression of the genes Apob, Ctgf, Serpinb2, Spp1, Il1b, and Sell, but elevated expression of Thbs4, Tgfb2, Ccr1, and Vegfa. Methionine-deprived diet reduced expression of Col3a1, Cdh5, Fabp3, Bax, and Hbegf and increased expression of Sell, Ccl5, Itga2, Birc3, Msr1, Bcl2a1a, Il1r2, and Selp. Methionine-deprived diet exerted pro-inflammatory consequences as evidenced by elevated levels of cytokines IL-1\u00df, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 noted in liver. Methionine-supplemented diet increased hepatic IL-6 and cardiac TNF-\u03b1. Both methionine supplementation and deprivation lowered hepatic levels of APOA5.

To improve this recovery, several groups have developed cardiac patches based on different biomaterials strategies. Here, we developed polyvinylalcohol/dextran (PVA/Dex) elastic hydrogel patches, obtained through the freeze thawing (FT) process, with the aim to deliver locally a potent natural antioxidant molecule, astaxanthin, and to assist the heart's response against the generated myofibril stress. Extensive rheological and dynamo-mechanical characterization of the effect of the PVA molecular weight, number of freeze-thawing cycles and Dex addition on the mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels, were carried out. Hydrogel systems based on PVA 145 kDa and PVA 47 kDa blended with Dex 40 kDa, were chosen as the most promising candidates for this application. In order to improve astaxanthin solubility, an inclusion system using hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin was prepared. This system was posteriorly loaded within the PVA/Dex hydrogels. PVA145/Dex 1FT and PVA47/Dex 3FT showed the best rheological and mechanical properties when compared to the other studied systems; environmental scanning electron microscope and confocal imaging evidenced a porous structure of the hydrogels allowing astaxanthin release. In vitro cellular behavior was analyzed after 24 h of contact with astaxanthin-loaded hydrogels. In vivo subcutaneous biocompatibility was performed in rats using PVA145/Dex 1FT, as the best compromise between mechanical support and astaxanthin delivery.

Silencing SIRT3 facilitated angiotensin II-induced aberrant Pink/Parkin acetylation and impaired mitophagy, while excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation limited angiogenic capacity in primary mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, SIRT3 overexpression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells enhanced Pink/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, attenuated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, and restored vessel sprouting and tube formation. In parallel, endothelial cell-specific SIRT3 transgenic mice showed decreased fibrosis, as well as improved cardiac function and microvascular network, compared with wild-type mice with similar stimuli.\nCollectively, these findings suggest that SIRT3 could promote angiogenesis through attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction caused by defective mitophagy.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2017-09-02", "authors": ["TongWei", "GaojianHuang", "JingGao", "ChenglinHuang", "MengweiSun", "JianWu", "JuanBu", "WeiliShen"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.117.006114\n10.1007/s00395-015-0493-6\n10.1161/JAHA.115.001770"}
{"title": "Antioxidant Therapeutic Strategies for Cardiovascular Conditions Associated with Oxidative Stress.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress (OS) refers to the imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability to scavenge these ROS by endogenous antioxidant systems, where ROS overwhelms the antioxidant capacity. Excessive presence of ROS results in irreversible damage to cell membranes, DNA, and other cellular structures by oxidizing lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases related to hypoxia, cardiotoxicity and ischemia-reperfusion. Here, we describe the participation of OS in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction, anthracycline cardiotoxicity and congenital heart disease.

{"title": "Evaluation of Local tissue oxidative stress and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis in rats experimentally infected with Toxoplasma gondii.", "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is a zoonotic parasitic disease. Oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the host's defense against protozoan infection. In the present study the possible involvement of local oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of T. gondii were investigated. Twenty five female Wistar rats were infected with RH strain of Toxoplasma tachyzoites and twenty female rats were used as control group that only received sterile PBS. Tissue samples from liver, heart and brain on 0, 3, 5, 8 and 45 days post infection were collected. As biochemical markers of oxidative stress, endogenous concentrations of GSH, GPX and SOD activity, MDA level, protein carbonyl content and total antioxidant capacity were determined from the mentioned tissues of control and infected rats. Based on the results, on day 3, 5 and 8 post infection the level of hepatic glutathione were significantly decreased in infected rats when compared to control. There was a significant rise in hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity and malondialdehyde level on the third day post infection in comparison to uninfected rats. Significant elevation of superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde level on 5 day post infection and protein carbonyls and total antioxidant capacity on 8 day post infection in infected livers were obtained. Significant changes of glutathione level, total antioxidant capacity and protein carbonyls contents were observed in cardiac homogenate on days 3, 5 and 45, respectively. Measured parameters were constant throughout all stages of experiment in brain of infected rats. Indeed increased production of reactive oxygen species accompanies Toxoplasma infection in liver and heart tissues of experimentally infected rats. Based on this study, antioxidant defense system can probably play a role in parasitic stage interconversion and shifting the toxoplasmosis into the chronic phase.", "journal": "Tropical biomedicine", "date": "2017-09-01", "authors": ["IDelavari", "GKhadjeh", "SBahrami", "S MJalali", "SEsmaeelzadeh"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Do right-ventricular trabeculae gain energetic advantage from having a greater velocity of shortening?", "abstract": "We designed a study to test whether velocity of shortening in right-ventricular tissue preparations is greater than that of the left side under conditions mimicking those encountered by the heart in vivo. Our experiments allowed us to explore whether greater velocity of shortening results in any energetic advantage. We found that velocity of shortening was higher in the rat right-ventricular trabeculae. These results at the tissue level seem paradoxical to the velocity of ventricular ejection at the organ level, and are not always in accord with shortening of unloaded cells. Despite greater velocity of shortening in right-ventricular trabeculae, they neither gained nor lost advantage with respect to both mechanical efficiency and the heat generated during shortening.\nOur study aimed to ascertain whether the interventricular difference of shortening velocity, reported for isolated cardiac tissues in vitro, affects interventricular mechano-energetic performance when tested under physiological conditions using a shortening protocol designed to mimic those in vivo. We isolated trabeculae from both ventricles of the rat, mounted them in a calorimeter, and performed experiments at 37\u00b0C and 5\u00a0Hz stimulus frequency to emulate conditions of the rat heart in vivo. Each trabecula was subjected to two experimental protocols: (i) isotonic work-loop contractions at a variety of afterloads, and (ii) isometric contractions at a variety of preloads. Velocity of shortening was calculated from the former protocol during the isotonic shortening phase of the contraction. Simultaneous measurements of force-length work and heat output allowed calculation of mechanical efficiency. The shortening-dependent thermal component was quantified from the difference in heat output between the two protocols. Our results show that both extent of shortening and velocity of shortening were higher in trabeculae from the right ventricle. Despite these differences, trabeculae from both ventricles developed the same stress, performed the same work, liberated the same amount of heat, and hence operated at the same mechanical efficiency. Shortening heat was also ventricle independent. The interventricular differences in velocity of shortening and extent of shortening of isolated trabeculae were not manifested in any index of energetics. These collective results underscore the absence of any mechano-energetic advantage or disadvantage conferred on right-ventricular trabeculae arising from their superior velocity of shortening.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2017-09-01", "authors": ["ToanPham", "June-ChiewHan", "AndrewTaberner", "DenisLoiselle"], "doi": "10.1113/JP274837\n10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969675"}
{"title": "Myofibrils in Cardiomyocytes Tend to Assemble Along the Maximal Principle Stress Directions.", "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the spatial organization of self-assembled myofibrils in cardiac tissues remain incompletely understood. By modeling cells as elastic solids under active cytoskeletal contraction, we found a good correlation between the predicted maximal principal stress directions and the in vitro myofibril orientations in individual cardiomyocytes. This implies that actomyosin fibers tend to assemble along the maximal tensile stress (MTS) directions. By considering the dynamics of focal adhesion and myofibril formation in the model, we showed that different patterns of myofibril organizations in mature versus immature cardiomyocytes can be explained as the consequence of the different levels of force-dependent remodeling of focal adhesions. Further, we applied the mechanics model to cell pairs and showed that the myofibril organizations can be regulated by a combination of multiple factors including cell shape, cell-substrate adhesions, and cell-cell adhesions. This mechanics model can guide the rational design in cardiac tissue engineering where recapitulating in vivo myofibril organizations is crucial to the contractile function of the heart.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2017-09-01", "authors": ["HongyanYuan", "BahadorMarzban", "KevinKit Parker"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4037795\n10.1126/science.1163267\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.01.020\n10.1016/0022-2828(95)90000-4\n10.1083/jcb.201508026\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1007/s10237-012-0419-2\n10.1126/science.1146885\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182469\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.03.011\n10.1038/nrm2634\n10.1083/jcb.99.6.2268\n10.1002/cm.970280102\n10.1002/cm.20290\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001088\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.08.045\n10.1096/fj.02-0038com\n10.1007/s00424-011-0954-1\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1098/rsif.2007.1182\n10.1073/pnas.0605837103\n10.1002/cm.20126\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.05.022\n10.1007/s11626-009-9182-9\n10.1038/nphys1613\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.01.011\n10.1073/pnas.0912739107\n10.1083/jcb.201210090\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90449-O\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.108101\n10.1073/pnas.1217279110\n10.1083/jcb.153.6.1175\n10.1016/S1361-8415(98)80009-1\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1073/pnas.0502575102\n10.1073/pnas.1203007109\n10.1073/pnas.94.17.9493\n10.1152/ajpheart.00515.2010\n10.1091/mbc.E14-12-1618\n10.1002/jor.1100040307\n10.1126/science.1165594\n10.1002/wsbm.1330\n10.1242/jcs.029678"}

In the present study, aortic banding (AB) was performed on mice to induce cardiac hypertrophy. After 1\u00a0week AB surgery, mice were treated daily with 10 or 20\u00a0mg/kg Sanggenon C for 3\u00a0weeks. Subsequently, cardiac function was detected using echocardiography and catheter\u2011based measurements of hemodynamic parameters. In addition, the extent of cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by pathological staining and molecular analysis of heart tissue in each group. After 4\u00a0weeks of AB, vehicle\u2011treated mice exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and deteriorated systolic and diastolic function, whereas treatment with 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg Sanggenon C treatment ameliorated these alterations, as evidenced by attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and preserved cardiac function.

{"title": "Interleukin-6 deficiency facilitates myocardial dysfunction during high fat diet-induced obesity by promoting lipotoxicity and inflammation.", "abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic disorder and chronic inflammation that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases. IL-6 is involved in regulating obesity-related lipid metabolism and inflammation. In this study, we sought to determine the role of IL-6 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiomyopathy and explore the signaling pathway.\nFemale, 5-week-old IL-6 knockout (KO) and littermate mice were fed a normal diet (ND, 10% fat) or HFD (45% fat) for 14 weeks. At the end of treatment, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Adipose tissues and plasma were collected for further measurement. Immunohistology of CD68 was performed to detect inflammation in the heart. Masson's trichrome staining and Oil Red O staining was applied to evaluated cardiac fibrosis and lipid accumulation. Real-time PCR and Western immunoblotting analyses on heart tissue were used to explore the underlying mechanism.\nIL-6 KO mice displayed increased insulin resistance compared to WT mice at baseline. When fed HFD, IL-6 KO mice showed decreased gains in body weight and fat mass, increased insulin resistance relative to IL-6 KO mice feed ND. Furthermore, IL-6 KO mice developed cardiac dysfunction during HFD-induced obesity. Histological analysis suggested increased lipid accumulation, fibrosis and inflammation without affecting cardiac morphology during HFD treatment in the heart of IL-6 KO mice. Finally, IL-6 deficiency increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in the heart during HFD-induced obesity.\nOur results suggest that IL-6 contributes to limit lipid metabolic disorder, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation and myocardium lipotoxicity during HFD-induced obesity.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

{"title": "Novel axolotl cardiac function analysis method using magnetic resonance imaging.", "abstract": "The salamander axolotl is capable of complete regeneration of amputated heart tissue. However, non-invasive imaging tools for assessing its cardiac function were so far not employed. In this study, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is introduced as a non-invasive technique to image heart function of axolotls. Three axolotls were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging using a retrospectively gated Fast Low Angle Shot cine sequence. Within one scanning session the axolotl heart was imaged three times in all planes, consecutively. Heart rate, ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated using three techniques: (1) combined long-axis, (2) short-axis series, and (3) ultrasound (control for heart rate only). All values are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Heart rate (beats per minute) among different animals was 32.2\u00b16.0 (long axis), 30.4\u00b15.5 (short axis) and 32.7\u00b14.9 (ultrasound) and statistically similar regardless of the imaging method (p > 0.05). Ejection fraction (%) was 59.6\u00b110.8 (long axis) and 48.1\u00b111.3 (short axis) and it differed significantly (p = 0.019).

Calculations were consistent among the animals and over three repeated measurements. The heart rate varied depending on depth of anaesthesia.

{"title": "Inhibition of PDE4 by low doses of rolipram induces changes in lipid and protein components of mice heart.", "abstract": "There is significant increasing interest in phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibition in treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Related with this, research has focused on cellular, biochemical, molecular and structural changes in heart tissue induced by PDE4s inhibitors. However, for their clinical applicability additional studies are still needed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy offers promising approach to contribute such issue due to its ability in detection the changes in biomolecules. By utilizing this method, we examined the effects of PDE4 inhibition by rolipram at 0.05 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg doses on content of lipids and proteins, and fluidity, order and packing of membranes in naive mice heart. In treated groups, there was a significant decrease in unsaturated, saturated lipids, cholesterol esters, fatty acids, phospholipids and triacylgylcerols obtained from CH2, C=O, olefinic=CH, and COO- areas, and CH2/lipid, C=O/lipid, olefinic=CH/lipid, and COO-/lipid ratios. Additionally, olefinic=CH area and olefinic=CH/lipid ratio may suggest decreased lipid peroxidation, confirmed by thiobarbituric acid assay. Also, a higher degree of membrane order, slight increase in membrane fluidity and differences in membrane packing were obtained. Amide I and II areas and RNA/protein ratios showed that variation in protein content is not correlated with applied concentration. Analysis of amide I mode predicted alterations in secondary structures like an increase in random coils and decrease in alpha-helices. Moreover, all groups were successfully discriminated by cluster analysis.

Such new approaches are developed to induce tissue regeneration following injury. Hence, regenerative medicine plays a key role in treating CVD. Recently, the extrinsic stimulation of cardiac regeneration has involved the use of potential polymers to stimulate stem cells toward the differentiation of cardiomyocytes as a new therapeutic intervention in cardiac tissue engineering (CTE). The therapeutic potentiality of natural or synthetic polymers and cell surface interactive factors/polymer surface modifications for cardiac repair has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that cardiac tissue-specific deletion of TLR4 protects the heart against such damage. Since the autonomic regulation of systemic cardiovascular function originates from pre-autonomic sympathetic centers in the brain, it is unclear how a systemically driven sympathetic change may affect the pre-autonomic paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN) TLR4 expression. Here, we examined how change in PVN TLR4 was associated with alterations in the neurochemical cytoarchitecture of the PVN in systemic adrenergic activation. After 48 h of intraperitoneal 150 mg/kg ISOP treatment, there was a change in PVN CaMKII\u03b1 and MAPK/ErK expression, and an increase in TLR4 in expression.

{"title": "Toxic effects of orally ingested oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on laughing gulls.", "abstract": "The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig released, millions of gallons of oil into the environment, subsequently exposing wildlife, including numerous bird species. To determine the effects of MC252 oil to species relevant to the Gulf of Mexico, studies were done examining multiple exposure scenarios and doses. In this study, laughing gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla, LAGU) were offered fish injected with MC252 oil at target doses of 5 or 10mL/kg bw per day. Dosing continued for 27 days. Of the adult, mixed-sex LAGUs used in the present study, ten of 20 oil exposed LAGUs survived to the end of the study; a total of 10 of the oil exposed LAGUs died or were euthanized within 20 days of initiation of the study. Endpoints associated with oxidative stress, hepatic total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (rGSH) significantly increased as mean dose of oil increased, while the rGSH:GSSG ratio showed a non-significant negative trend with oil dose. A significant increase in 3-methyl histidine was found in oil exposed birds when compared to controls indicative of muscle wastage and may have been associated with the gross observation of diminished structural integrity in cardiac tissue. Consistent with previous oil dosing studies in birds, significant changes in liver, spleen, and kidney weight when normalized to body weight were observed. These studies indicate that mortality in response to oil dosing is relatively common and the mortality exhibited by the gulls is consistent with previous studies examining oil toxicity. Whether survival effects in the gull study were associated with weight loss, physiologic effects of oil toxicity, or a behavioral response that led the birds to reject the dosed fish is unknown.", "journal": "Ecotoxicology and environmental safety", "date": "2017-08-22", "authors": ["K EHorak", "S JBursian", "C KEllis", "K MDean", "J ELink", "K CHanson-Dorr", "F LCunningham", "K EHarr", "C APritsos", "K LPritsos", "K AHealy", "DCacela", "S AShriner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.07.018"}
{"title": "Stacked silk-cell monolayers as a biomimetic three dimensional construct for cardiac tissue reconstruction.", "abstract": "Heart failure, due to necrosis of heart tissue, interminably poses a significant burden on world-wide health care systems. In this context, a facile tissue engineering approach using mulberry (Bombyx mori) and non-mulberry (Antheraea assama) silk fibroin (SF) has been delved into. Amalgamating the efficacious attributes of cell sheet tissue engineering and robusticity of silk biomaterial, we developed a 3-D construct using silk films to promote cardiac tissue regeneration. Herein, the fabricated patterned silk films were physico-chemically characterized and analysed for their compatibility with cardiomyocytes. The presence of nanogrooves on silk films provided contact guidance to the growing cardiomyocytes allowing them to form unidirectionally aligned cell monolayers. Non-mulberry silk films exhibiting significantly greater mechanical strength and low immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo supported better growth, proliferation and maturation of both primary rat cardiomyocytes (PCMs) and H9c2 cells. The directional cue and presence of cell binding motifs such as RGD in A. assama films favoured the growth and maturation of cardiomyocytes to their functional phenotype. Cardiomyocyte maturation was attested by significant (p\u2264 0.05) upregulation of myosin heavy chain-\u03b1 (\u223c1.25 fold), connexin 43 (\u223c2 fold), and troponin I (\u223c1.25 fold) genes in PCMs grown on non-mulberry silk films. The patterned silk-cardiomyocyte monolayers were then stacked onto each other while maintaining their alignment to form a 3-D construct which exhibited structural integrity and uniform cellular distribution. Taking together, this work attests the suitability of non-mulberry A. assama silk fibroin as a potential biomaterial and prospects of exploring silk-cardiomyocyte monolayers for cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

Serum was used to evaluate tissue injury markers, while hepatic, renal, and cardiac tissue samples were obtained for determination of antioxidant activity as well as histopathological examination. Diosmin treatment ameliorated the MTX-induced elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases, urea, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinases as well as plasma proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Additionally, both diosmin doses significantly reduced tissue levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and increased those of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, compared to the MTX-intoxicated group. Histopathological examination showed that diosmin significantly minimized the MTX-induced histological alterations and nearly restored the normal architecture of hepatic, renal, and cardiac tissues. Based on these findings, diosmin may be a promising agent for protection against MTX-induced cytotoxicity in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2017-08-19", "authors": ["Mohamed MAbdel-Daim", "Hesham AKhalifa", "Abdelrahman IbrahimAbushouk", "Mohamed ADkhil", "Saleh AAl-Quraishy"], "doi": "10.1155/2017/3281670\n10.1056/NEJM198311033091805\n10.1093/rheumatology/kem279\n10.2165/00002018-200124010-00003\n10.1592/phco.2005.25.9.1271\n10.1016/j.alcohol.2012.12.010\n10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.003\n10.1007/s10753-016-0413-4\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.04.026\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.08.031\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.07.005\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.09.001\n10.1016/0003-2697(82)90118-X\n10.1590/S0102-865020150040000003\n10.3109/0886022X.2016.1158070\n10.1177/0960327116637414\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.09918.x\n10.1038/75045\n10.4239/wjd.v5.i3.393\n10.1681/ASN.2007091048\n10.1017/S0007114512005752\n10.1093/toxsci/kfm260\n10.1016/j.tox.2011.08.020\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.12.040\n10.1016/j.tox.2008.11.016\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.03.032\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.04.004\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.08.019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0122417\n10.14670/HH-28.865\n10.1155/2013/387071\n10.3109/0886022X.2015.1012984"}

{"title": "HIV-1 Nef-induced cardiotoxicity through dysregulation of autophagy.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of co-morbidity in HIV-1 positive patients, even those in whom plasma virus levels are well-controlled. The pathogenic mechanism of HIV-1-associated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but has been presumed to be mediated indirectly, owing to the absence of productive HIV-1 replication in cardiomyocytes. We sought to investigate the effect of the HIV-1 auxiliary protein, Nef, which is suspected of extracellular release by infected CD4+ T cells on protein quality control and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. After detection of Nef in the serum of HIV-1 positive patients and the accumulation of this protein in human and primate heart tissue from HIV-1/SIV-infected cells we employed cell and molecular biology approaches to investigate the effect of Nef on cardiomyocyte-homeostasis by concentrating on protein quality control (PQC) pathway and autophagy. We found that HIV-1 Nef-mediated inhibition of autophagy flux leads to cytotoxicity and death of cardiomyocytes. Nef compromises autophagy at the maturation stage of autophagosomes by interacting with Beclin 1/Rab7 and dysregulating TFEB localization and cellular lysosome content. These effects were reversed by rapamycin treatment.

{"title": "Evaluation of telomere length in human cardiac tissues using cardiac quantitative FISH.", "abstract": "Telomere length has been correlated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. The use of currently available telomere-length measurement techniques is often restricted by the requirement of a large amount of cells (Southern-based techniques) or the lack of information on individual cells or telomeres (PCR-based methods). Although several methods have been used to measure telomere length in tissues as a whole, the assessment of cell-type-specific telomere length provides valuable information on individual cell types. The development of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technologies enables the quantification of telomeres in individual chromosomes, but the use of these methods is dependent on the availability of isolated cells, which prevents their use with fixed archival samples. Here we describe an optimized quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) protocol for measuring telomere length that bypasses the previous limitations by avoiding contributions from undesired cell types. We have used this protocol on small paraffin-embedded cardiac-tissue samples. This protocol describes step-by-step procedures for tissue preparation, permeabilization, cardiac-tissue pretreatment and hybridization with a Cy3-labeled telomeric repeat complementing (CCCTAA)", "journal": "Nature protocols", "date": "2017-08-18", "authors": ["MaryamSharifi-Sanjani", "Alan KMeeker", "FoteiniMourkioti"], "doi": "10.1038/nprot.2017.082\n10.18632/oncotarget"}
{"title": "G3BP2 is involved in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy through activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.", "abstract": "The RasGAP SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BPs) are a family of RNA-binding proteins that can co-ordinate signal transduction and post-transcriptional gene regulation. G3BPs have been shown to be involved in mediating a great diversity of cellular processes such as cell survival, growth, proliferation and apoptosis. But the potential roles of G3BPs in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular diseases remain to be clarified. In the present study, we provide the first evidence that suggests the participation of G3BP2 in cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), treatment with isoproterenol (ISO, 0.1-100 \u03bcmol/L) significantly elevated the mRNA and protein levels of G3BP2. Similar results were observed in the hearts of rats subjected to 7D-injection of ISO, accompanied by obvious heart hypertrophy and elevated the expression of hypertrophy marker genes ANF, BNP and \u03b2-MHC in heart tissues. Overexpression of G3BP2 in NRCMs led to hypertrophic responses evidenced by increased cellular surface area and the expression of hypertrophy marker genes, whereas knockdown of G3BP2 significantly attenuated ISO-induced hypertrophy of NRCMs. We further showed that G3BP2 directly interacted with I\u03baB\u03b1 and promoted the aggregation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in the nucleus and increased NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional activity. NF-\u03baB inhibition with PDTC (50 \u03bcmol/L) or p65 knockdown significantly decreased the hypertrophic responses in NRCMs induced by ISO or G3BP2 overexpression.

{"title": "The Sydney Heart Bank: improving translational research while eliminating or reducing the use of animal models of human heart disease.", "abstract": "The Sydney Heart Bank (SHB) is one of the largest human heart tissue banks in existence. Its mission is to provide high-quality human heart tissue for research into the molecular basis of human heart failure by working collaboratively with experts in this field. We argue that, by comparing tissues from failing human hearts with age-matched non-failing healthy donor hearts, the results will be more relevant than research using animal models, particularly if their physiology is very different from humans. Tissue from heart surgery must generally be used soon after collection or it significantly deteriorates. Freezing is an option but it raises concerns that freezing causes substantial damage at the cellular and molecular level. The SHB contains failing samples from heart transplant patients and others who provided informed consent for the use of their tissue for research. All samples are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen within 40\u00a0min of their removal from the patient, and in less than 5-10\u00a0min in the case of coronary arteries and left ventricle samples. To date, the SHB has collected tissue from about 450 failing hearts (>15,000 samples) from patients with a wide range of etiologies as well as increasing numbers of cardiomyectomy samples from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The Bank also has hearts from over 120 healthy organ donors whose hearts, for a variety of reasons (mainly tissue-type incompatibility with waiting heart transplant recipients), could not be used for transplantation. Donor hearts were collected by the St Vincent's Hospital Heart and Lung transplantation team from local hospitals or within a 4-h jet flight from Sydney. They were flushed with chilled cardioplegic solution and transported to Sydney where they were quickly cryopreserved in small samples. Failing and/or donor samples have been used by more than 60 research teams around the world, and have resulted in more than 100 research papers.

{"title": "Direct Production of Human Cardiac Tissues by Pluripotent Stem Cell Encapsulation in Gelatin Methacryloyl.", "abstract": "Direct stem cell encapsulation and cardiac differentiation within supporting biomaterial scaffolds are critical for reproducible and scalable production of the functional human tissues needed in regenerative medicine and drug-testing applications. Producing cardiac tissues directly from pluripotent stem cells rather than assembling tissues using pre-differentiated cells can eliminate multiple cell-handling steps that otherwise limit the potential for process automation and production scale-up. Here we asked whether our process for forming 3D developing human engineered cardiac tissues using poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels can be extended to widely used and printable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. We demonstrate that low-density GelMA hydrogels can be formed rapidly using visible light (<1 min) and successfully employed to encapsulate human induced pluripotent stem cells while maintaining high cell viability. Resulting constructs had an initial stiffness of approximately 220 Pa, supported tissue growth and dynamic remodeling, and facilitated high-efficiency cardiac differentiation (>70%) to produce spontaneously contracting GelMA human engineered cardiac tissues (GEhECTs). GEhECTs initiated spontaneous contractions on day 8 of differentiation, with synchronicity, frequency, and velocity of contraction increasing over time, and displayed developmentally appropriate temporal changes in cardiac gene expression. GEhECT-dissociated cardiomyocytes displayed well-defined and aligned sarcomeres spaced at 1.85 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm and responded appropriately to drug treatments, including the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and antagonist propranolol, as well as to outside pacing up to 3.0 Hz.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Wistar rats were used to establish a PM2.5 exposure animal model during pregnancy, and they were divided into a control group, a low-dose group, a middle-dose group, and a high-dose group according to PM2.5 exposure dose. The pathological changes of heart tissue, the rate of myocardial cell apoptosis, the levels of LDH, AST, and CM-KB in serum, and the difference in mitochondrial fusion genes (OPA1 and Mfn1) and mitochondrial genes (Drp1 and Fis1) were compared among groups. RESULTS The arrangement of myocardial fibers in offspring mice of PM2.5 exposure groups became disordered, the shape of some cardiomyocytes became irregular, and some staining darker nuclei appeared. The apoptotic rates of myocardium in offspring rats exposed to PM2.5 were (12.61\u00b10.93)% in the low-dose group, (25.14\u00b11.53)% in the middle-dose group, and (30.13\u00b11.50)% in the high-dose group, which were all significantly higher than in the control group (9.12\u00b10.80)% (P<0.05). The levels of LDH, AST, and CM-KB and the expression of OPA1, Mfn1, Drp1, and Fis1 in offspring mice of PM2.5 exposure groups increased with the increase of PM2.5 exposure dose, and were significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05).

Here we evaluated the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their conditioned medium (CM) to treat cardiac complications in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.\nAfter obesity induction and HFD withdrawal, obese mice were treated with MSCs, CM or vehicle. Cardiac function was assessed using electrocardiography, echocardiography and treadmill test. Body weight and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Cardiac tissue was used for real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and histopathologic analysis.\nCharacterization of CM by protein array showed the presence of different cytokines and growth factors, including chemokines, osteopontin, cystatin C, Serpin E1 and Gas 6. HFD-fed mice presented cardiac arrhythmias, altered cardiac gene expression and fibrosis reflected in physical exercise incapacity associated with obesity and diabetes. Administration of MSCs or CM improved arrhythmias and exercise capacity. This functional improvement correlated with normalization of GATA4 gene expression in the hearts of MSC- or CM-treated mice. The gene expression of connexin 43, troponin I, adiponectin, transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) were significantly reduced in MSCs, but not in CM-treated mice.

{"title": "Dynamics of spatiotemporal line defects and chaos control in complex excitable systems.", "abstract": "Spatiotemporal pattern formation governs dynamics and functions in various biological systems. In the heart, excitable waves can form complex oscillatory and chaotic patterns even at an abnormally higher frequency than normal heart beats, which increase the risk of fatal heart conditions by inhibiting normal blood circulation. Previous studies suggested that line defects (nodal lines) play a critical role in stabilizing those undesirable patterns. However, it remains unknown if the line defects are static or dynamically changing structures in heart tissue. Through in vitro experiments of heart tissue observation, we reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of line defects in rotating spiral waves. We combined a novel signaling over-sampling technique with a multi-dimensional Fourier analysis, showing that line defects can translate, merge, collapse and form stable singularities with even and odd parity while maintaining a stable oscillation of the spiral wave in the tissue. These findings provide insights into a broad class of complex periodic systems, with particular impact to the control and understanding of heart diseases.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-08-12", "authors": ["MarcelH\u00f6rning", "Fran\u00e7oisBlanchard", "AkihiroIsomura", "KenichiYoshikawa"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-08011-z\n10.1126/science.175.4022.634\n10.1126/science.7973648\n10.1073/pnas.0908278107\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.007\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/1/015004\n10.1006/jtbi.1999.0957\n10.1103/PhysRevE.78.066216\n10.1103/PhysRevE.85.031915\n10.1103/PhysRevE.86.031912\n10.1103/PhysRevE.83.040902\n10.1161/01.CIR.67.6.1356\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00071\n10.1152/ajpheart.01036.2009\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.14.1664\n10.1152/ajpheart.00390.2009\n10.1088/1361-6579/aa64af\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.12.018\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.04.008\n10.1038/330749a0\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.5.1661\n10.1161/01.RES.0000119923.64774.72\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.02.034\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74784-5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000240542.03986.e7\n10.1103/PhysRevE.79.026218\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.118106\n10.1152/ajpcell.00013.2003\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473\n10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021926\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.025502\n10.1152/ajpheart.00079.2012\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.003\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.12.012\n10.1016/S0164-0704(02)00012-5\n10.1364/OE.15.011781\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-071312-121656\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.10.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085365\n10.1529/biophysj.105.063321\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.12.4280\n10.1073/pnas.0704204104\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.098302\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.068302"}

Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) and Klotho are novel key players in CKD-MBD, and has been suggested to be involved in the development of CVD.\nThis prospective cohort study included 74 pediatric patients; 31 with CKD (age range 0.8-18.8\u00a0years, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) range 9-68\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m\nThe prevalence of high FGF23 levels (\u226595th percentile) was 60% in CKD and 42% in CKD-T patients, despite a low prevalence of hyperphosphatemia and normal Klotho levels. Low GFR at baseline was a predictor for high mean log FGF23 during follow-up in CKD and CKD-T patients (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

{"title": "The impact of FOXO-1 to cardiac pathology in diabetes mellitus and diabetes-related metabolic abnormalities.", "abstract": "Diabetic heart pathology has a serious social impact due to high prevalence worldwide and significant mortality/invalidation of diabetic patients suffered from cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis of diabetic and diabetes-related cardiomyopathy is associated with progressive loss and impairment of cardiac function due to adverse effects of metabolic, prooxidant, proinflammatory, and pro-apoptotic stress factors. In the adult heart, the transcriptional factor forkhead box-1 (FOXO-1) is involved in maintaining cardiomyocytes in the homeostatic state and induction of their adaptation to metabolic and pro-oxidant stress stimuli. Insulin inhibits cardiac FOXO-1 expression/activity through the IRS1/Akt signaling in order to prevent gluconeogenesis. In diabetes and insulin resistance, both insulin production and insulin-dependent signaling is weakened or absent. Indeed, FOXO-1 becomes overproduced/overactivated in response to stress stimuli. In diabetic cardiac tissue, FOXO-1 overactivity induces the metabolic switch from the glucose uptake to the predominant lipid uptake. FOXO-1 limits mitochondrial glucose oxidation by stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and increases the lipid uptake through up-regulation of surface expression of CD36. In cardiac muscle cells, lipid accumulation leads to lipotoxicity via increased lipid oxidation, oxidative stress, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Indeed, cardiac FOXO-1 levels and activity should be strictly regulated.

However, because of the pleiotropic effects of PDGFR signaling, its role in mediating the cardiac fibrotic response remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of c-Kit in cardiac fibroblasts activated by PDGFRa signaling. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cardiac fibrosis mice model was induced using isoproterenol, and the heart tissues of mice were tested through western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The cardiac fibroblasts of neonatal mice were treated with PDGF-AA or transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for the mouse c-Kit gene. The levels of collagen I, collagen III, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were analyzed using western blotting and RT-qPCR. RESULTS In the heart of the cardiac fibrosis mice model, the activity of c-Kit was enhanced. PDGF-AA treatment accelerated the activity of c-Kit in cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, imatinib inhibited the activity of c-Kit in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of c-Kit by siRNAs reduced the expression of \u03b1-SMA and collagens in the activated cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, PDGFRa directly bound c-Kit in cardiac fibroblasts and stimulated the expression of stem cell factor (SCF).

{"title": "Hepatocytic differentiation of iPS cells on decellularized liver tissue.", "abstract": "Decellularized tissues (DETs) have been attracting great attention as scaffolds for tissue-engineering approaches. Recently, some studies have reported that decellularized liver tissues (DLT) can provide an excellent environment for the hepatocytic differentiation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells that were already committed to the hepatocyte lineage. However, the effects of DLT on the hepatocytic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSs) have not yet been established. Here we studied the hepatocytic differentiation of iPSs on DLT and decellularized heart tissues (DHT) in order to determine the tissue-specific effects of DETs on iPSs differentiation. Our results showed that DLTs led to higher gene expression levels of forkhead box A2 (a marker of endoderm) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (master transcription factor to hepatocyte differentiation), alpha-fetoprotein (a marker of fetal hepatocyte,), and albumin (a marker of fetal and\u00a0mature\u00a0hepatocyte) of iPSs than on DHTs. Furthermore, gene expression levels of tyrosine aminotransferase (a marker of mature hepatocyte) were higher on DLT than that on DHT, and immunocytochemical analysis and ELISA assay showed that albumin secretion level of iPSs on DLT was higher than that on DHT. Our study demonstrated that the use of DLTs led to mature hepatocytic differentiation levels of iPSs compared to DHTs, which provides a better niche for iPSs cell engineering and enables the preparation of useful mature cells for regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["MitsuhiHirata", "TetsujiYamaoka"], "doi": "10.1007/s10047-017-0977-2"}

The pathophysiological factors in diabetes that drive the development of cardiomyopathy include systemic metabolic disorders, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, subcellular component abnormalities, oxidative stress, inflammation and dysfunctional immune modulation. These abnormalities collectively promote cardiac tissue interstitial fibrosis, cardiac stiffness/diastolic dysfunction and, later, systolic dysfunction, precipitating the syndrome of clinical heart failure. Recent evidence has revealed that dysregulation of coronary endothelial cells and exosomes also contributes to the pathology behind diabetic cardiomyopathy.

{"title": "Transglutaminase 2 in pulmonary and cardiac tissue remodeling in experimental pulmonary hypertension.", "abstract": "Tissue matrix remodeling and fibrosis leading to loss of pulmonary arterial and right ventricular compliance are important features of both experimental and clinical pulmonary hypertension (PH). We have previously reported that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is involved in PH development while others have shown it to be a cross-linking enzyme that participates in remodeling of extracellular matrix in fibrotic diseases in general. In the present studies, we used a mouse model of experimental PH (Sugen 5416 and hypoxia; SuHypoxia) and cultured primary human cardiac and pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts to evaluate the relationship of TG2 to the processes of fibrosis, protein cross-linking, extracellular matrix collagen accumulation, and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation. We report here that TG2 expression and activity as measured by serotonylated fibronectin and protein cross-linking activity along with fibrogenic markers are significantly elevated in lungs and right ventricles of SuHypoxic mice with PH. Similarly, TG2 expression and activity, protein cross-linking activity, and fibrogenic markers are significantly increased in cultured cardiac and pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts in response to hypoxia exposure. Pharmacological inhibition of TG2 activity with ERW1041E significantly reduced hypoxia-induced cross-linking activity and synthesis of collagen 1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in both the in vivo and in vitro studies.

Advances in tissue and genetic engineering techniques are expected to improve the survival and integration of transplanted cells, and to support structural, functional, and bioenergetic recovery of the\u00a0recipient hearts.

A transgenic mouse strain overexpressing \u03b111 in muscle tissues was analysed in the current study with special reference to the heart tissue.\nWe generated and phenotyped integrin \u03b111 transgenic (TG) mice by echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to aortic banding (AB) and the expression of integrin \u03b111 was measured in flow cytometry-sorted cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes.\nTG mice developed left ventricular concentric hypertrophy by 6\u00a0months, with increased collagen deposition and reactivation of mRNA encoding foetal genes associated with cardiovascular pathological remodelling compared to WT mice. Masson's trichrome staining revealed interstitial fibrosis, confirmed additionally by magnetic resonance imaging and was found to be most prominent in the cardiac septum of TG but not WT mice. TG hearts expressed increased levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b22 and transforming growth factor-\u03b23 and upregulated smooth muscle actin. Macrophage infiltration coincided with increased NF-\u03baB signalling in TG but not WT hearts.

We found that linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, suppressed capillary rarefaction in the hearts of mice with dietary obesity. Metabolomic analysis performed with capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) showed that linagliptin promoted favorable metabolic remodeling in cardiac tissue, which was characterized by high levels of citrulline and creatine. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the cardiac tissue level of early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1), which activates angiogenesis, was significantly reduced in untreated mice with dietary obesity, while this decrease was inhibited by administration of linagliptin. Mature fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) has a putative truncation site for DPP-4 at the NH2-terminal, and LC-MS/MS showed that recombinant DPP-4 protein cleaved the NH2-terminal dipeptides of mature FGF-2. Incubation of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with FGF-2 increased Egr1 expression, while it was suppressed by recombinant DPP-4 protein. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor-A had a critical role in mediating FGF-2/EGR-1 signaling.

Although there is some evidence for the beneficial effect of bone marrow-derived cells in chagasic disease, the mechanisms underlying their effects in the heart are unknown. Reports have suggested that bone marrow cells are recruited to the chagasic heart; however, studies using chimeric mouse models of chagasic cardiomyopathy are rare.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the migration of bone marrow cells to the heart after T. cruzi infection in a model of chagasic disease in chimeric mice.\nTo obtain chimerical mice, wild-type (WT) C57BL6 mice were exposed to full body irradiation (7 Gy), causing bone marrow ablation. Then, bone marrow cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice were infused into the mice. Graft effectiveness was confirmed by flow cytometry. Experimental mice were divided into four groups: (i) infected chimeric (iChim) mice; (ii) infected WT (iWT) mice, both of which received 3 \u00d7 104 trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain; (iii) non-infected chimeric (Chim) mice; and (iv) non-infected WT mice.\nAt one-month post-infection, iChim and iWT mice showed first degree atrioventricular block with decreased heart rate and treadmill exercise parameters compared to those in the non-infected groups.\niChim mice showed an increase in parasitaemia, myocarditis, and the presence of amastigote nests in the heart tissue compared to iWT mice. Flow cytometry analysis did not detect haematopoietic progenitor cells in the hearts of infected mice. Furthermore, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were not detected in the tissues of chimeric mice.", "journal": "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["Camila IansenIrion", "Bruno DiazParedes", "Guilherme ViscondeBrasil", "Sandro Torrentes daCunha", "Luis FelipePaula", "Alysson RoncallyCarvalho", "Antonio Carlos Campos deCarvalho", "Adriana BastosCarvalho", "Regina Coeli Dos SantosGoldenberg"], "doi": "10.1590/0074-02760160526"}

We study the physical properties leading to these effects, and investigate mathematical conditions for its occurrence. Together, the mathematical model and the numerical results obtained using a mixed-primal finite element method, clearly support relevant consequences of stress-driven diffusion into anisotropy patterns, drifting, and conduction velocity of the resulting excitation waves.

This study aimed to assess the effect of high glucose on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte self-assembly into 3D microtissues and their calcium handling. Stem cells were differentiated to beating cardiomyocytes using established protocols. On the final day of the differentiation process, cells were treated with control media, 12\u00a0mM glucose, or 12\u00a0mM mannitol (an osmolality control). Once beating, the cardiac cells were dissociated with trypsin, collected, mixed with collagen, and plated into custom-made silicone micro molds in order to generate 3D cardiac microtissues. A time-lapse microscope took pictures every 4\u00a0h to quantify the kinetics of cellular self-assembly of 3D cardiac tissues. Fiber widths were recorded at 4-h intervals and plotted over time to assess cardiomyocyte 3D fiber self-assembly. Microtissue calcium flux was recorded with optical mapping by pacing microtissues at 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0Hz. Exposure to high glucose impaired the ability of cardiomyocytes to self-assemble into compact microtissues, but not their ability to spontaneously contract. Glucose-exposed cardiomyocytes took longer to self-assemble and finished as thicker fibers. When cardiac microtissues were paced at 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0Hz, those exposed to high glucose had altered calcium handling with shorter calcium transient durations, but larger amplitudes of the calcium transient when compared to controls. Additional studies are needed to elucidate a potential mechanism for these findings.

We also analyzed SERCA2a expression changes on EMBs using immunofluorescence.\nSERCA2a cardiac tissue and serum levels were decreased in patients with cardiac rejection (p < 0.0001). A receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that SERCA2a strongly discriminated between patients with and without allograft rejection: normal grafts vs all rejecting grafts (AUC = 0.804); normal grafts vs Grade 1R (AUC = 0.751); normal grafts vs Grade 2R (AUC = 0.875); normal grafts vs Grade 3R (AUC = 0.922); normal grafts vs Grade 2R and 3R (AUC = 0.889), with p < 0.0001 for all comparisons.\nWe demonstrated that changes in SERCA2a cardiac tissue and serum levels occur in cardiac allograft rejection. Our findings suggest that SERCA2a concentration assessment may be a relatively simple, non-invasive test for heart transplant rejection, showing a strong capability for detection that improves progressively as rejection grades increase.", "journal": "The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation", "date": "2017-07-29", "authors": ["Estefan\u00edaTaraz\u00f3n", "AnaOrtega", "CarolinaGil-Cayuela", "ElenaS\u00e1nchez-Lacuesta", "PilarMar\u00edn", "FranciscaLago", "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3nGonz\u00e1lez-Juanatey", "LuisMart\u00ednez-Dolz", "ManuelPortol\u00e9s", "MiguelRivera", "EstherRosell\u00f3-Llet\u00ed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2017.07.003"}

Rats received 1 to 8 weeks of diazoxide treatments (20 mg\u2022kg-1\u2022d-1) to establish a loss-of-cardioprotection model in different groups. Detection of serum cTnI levels and cell apoptosis assays in heart tissue were performed. Then, rats MIM after 0, 4 and 6 weeks of diazoxide treatment was isolated and proteomics analysis was performed. An invitro model of H9C2 cells was performed to explore the effects of targeted protein on delayed cardioprotection. The effect of delayed cardioprotection by diazoxide preconditioning disappeared when diazoxide treatments were given for six weeks or longer. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 (UQCRC1) was identified in the proteomics analysis. UQCRC1 expression was upregulated by diazoxide treatment in H9C2 cells, and UQCRC1 down-regulation could increase the lactate dehydrogenase release and apoptosis rate after injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation. These results showed that UQCRC1 might contribute to the loss-of-cardioprotection model induced by long-term diazoxide treatment and play a role in delayed cardioprotection.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-07-28", "authors": ["ZonghongLong", "GuangyouDuan", "HongLi", "TingtingYi", "XiaoxiaoWu", "FengChen", "ZhuoxiWu", "YuqiGao"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0181903\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114963\n10.1159/000447809\n10.1002/jcb.23274\n10.1155/2017/1314297\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000228\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147792"}

However, the exact mechanism of cardioprotective effect of Sch B still needs more study. Here, we detected the effects of Sch B on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury rats. I/R injury model in this study was established by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 40\u00a0min followed by 1\u00a0h of reperfusion. Male healthy rats were randomly divided into five groups: the sham, I/R, Sch B (20\u00a0mg/kg) + I/R, and Sch B (40\u00a0mg/kg) + I/R, Sch B (80\u00a0mg/kg) + I/R, with 10 rats in each group. We showed that Sch B treatment significantly protected against myocardial I/R injury, as demonstrated by the decrease in the percentage of infarct formation assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining in representative heart tissue slices, comparing with the I/R control group. The levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) were tested. The ER stress-related proteins such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) were further measured by western blot, and their messenger RNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. The apoptosis of heart tissue cells was also tested through the expressions of caspase-9, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins. Collectively, these results revealed that Sch B exerts protection role on myocardial I/R injury through decreasing oxidative reaction, suppressing ATF6 and PERK pathway, and attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2017-07-28", "authors": ["WeiZhang", "ZhiqingSun", "FanhuaMeng"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-017-0631-4"}

Patient-specific computational cardiac models can help guide such procedures, and cardiac inverse modeling is a promising alternative to adequately personalize these models. Indeed, full cardiac inverse modeling is currently becoming computationally feasible; however, fundamental work to assess the feasibility of emerging techniques is still needed. In this study, we use a partial differential equation-constrained optimal control approach to numerically investigate the identifiability of an initial activation sequence from synthetic (partial) observations of the extracellular potential using the bidomain approximation and 2D representations of cardiac tissue. Our results demonstrate that activation times and duration of several stimuli can be recovered even with high levels of noise, that it is sufficient to sample the observations at the electrocardiogram-relevant sampling frequency of 1\u00a0kHz, and that spatial resolutions that are coarser than the standard in electrophysiological simulations can be used. The optimization of activation times is still effective when synthetic data are generated with a different cell membrane kinetics model than optimized for.

Trimucrin significantly reduced I-R-induced arrhythmias and reduced mortality, as well as infarct volume, troponin-I levels, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase activity in carotid blood compared with vehicle-treated animals during the same period. Trimucrin also improved cardiac function and survival rates after I-R injury. In addition, trimucrin concentration-dependently inhibited platelet adhesion on collagen- and fibrinogen-coated surfaces without affecting platelet counts.

Our study showed that down-regulation of GAB1 occurred concurrently with HG-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and in the heart tissues of offspring of diabetic rats in vitro and in vivo. MTT and apoptosis assay showed GAB1 played a key role in mediating HG-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Down-regulation of XIAP and increased activities of Caspase3/7 was associated with GAB1-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to HG treatment. Further study showed that the phosphorylation levels of AKT (Ser473) decreased after HG treatment. Over-expression of GAB1 resisted the reduction in AKT phosphorylation in response to HG. LY294002, which is an effective inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, partly inhibited GAB1 to suppress apoptosis induced by HG in cardiomyocytes, and partly suppressed GAB1 to resist the decrease of XIAP in response to HG, indicating AKT signaling, XIAP, and Caspase3/7 participated in GAB1-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to HG.

Perturbations in Txn system may compromise cell survival through oxidative stress induction. Metabolic activity of insulin plays important roles in fulfilling the stable and persistent demands of heart through glucose metabolism. However, the roles of Txn and Txn system in insulin modulated cardiac energy metabolism have been less reported. Therefore, to investigate the role of Txn in myocardial metabolism, we developed a Se-deficient chicken model (0.033mg/kg) for in-vivo and Txn knock down cardiomyocytes culture model (siRNA) for in-vitro studies. Quantitative real time PCR and western blotting was performed. Se deficiency suppressed Txn and TR in cardiac tissues. Significant increases in ROS (P<0.05) levels signify the onset of oxidative stress and in both models. Se deficiency-induced Txn suppression model and Txn knock down cardiomyocytes models significantly decreased (P<0.05), the mRNA and protein levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGF1, IGF2), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP2, IGFBP4), insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, IRS2), and glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT8), however, IGFBP3 expression increased in Txn knock down cardiomyocytes. In addition, in contrast to their respective controls, Se deficiency-induced Txn depleted tissues and Txn deleted cardiomyocytes showed suppression in mRNA and protein levels of PI3K, AKT, P-PI3K, and repression in FOX, P-FOX JNK genes. Combing the in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that Txn gene suppression can cause dysfunction of insulin-modulated cardiac energy metabolism and increase insulin resistance through PI3K-Akt pathway inhibition. Herein, we conclude that inactivation of Txn system can alter cellular insulin response through IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway repression and JNK and FOX expression. These findings point out that Txn system can redox regulate the insulin dependent glucose metabolism in heart and is essential for cell vitality.

{"title": "Mitochondrial function in engineered cardiac tissues is regulated by extracellular matrix elasticity and tissue alignment.", "abstract": "Mitochondria in cardiac myocytes are critical for generating ATP to meet the high metabolic demands associated with sarcomere shortening. Distinct remodeling of mitochondrial structure and function occur in cardiac myocytes in both developmental and pathological settings. However, the factors that underlie these changes are poorly understood. Because remodeling of tissue architecture and extracellular matrix (ECM) elasticity are also hallmarks of ventricular development and disease, we hypothesize that these environmental factors regulate mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes. To test this, we developed a new procedure to transfer tunable polydimethylsiloxane disks microcontact-printed with fibronectin into cell culture microplates. We cultured Sprague-Dawley neonatal rat ventricular myocytes within the wells, which consistently formed tissues following the printed fibronectin, and measured oxygen consumption rate using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. Our data indicate that parameters associated with baseline metabolism are predominantly regulated by ECM elasticity, whereas the ability of tissues to adapt to metabolic stress is regulated by both ECM elasticity and tissue alignment. Furthermore, bioenergetic health index, which reflects both the positive and negative aspects of oxygen consumption, was highest in aligned tissues on the most rigid substrate, suggesting that overall mitochondrial function is regulated by both ECM elasticity and tissue alignment.

While direct differentiation of human embryoid bodies holds great promise for cardiac organoid production, intramyocardial cell organization during heart development provides biological foundation to fabricate human cardiac organoids with defined cell types. Inspired by the intramyocardial organization events in coronary vasculogenesis, where a diverse, yet defined, mixture of cardiac cell types self-organizes into functional myocardium in the absence of blood flow, we have developed a defined method to produce scaffold-free human cardiac organoids that structurally and functionally resembled the lumenized vascular network in the developing myocardium, supported hiPSC-CM development and possessed fundamental cardiac tissue-level functions. In particular, this development-driven strategy offers a robust, tunable system to examine the contributions of individual cell types, matrix materials and additional factors for developmental insight, biomimetic matrix composition to advance biomaterial design, tissue/organ-level drug screening, and cell therapy for heart repair.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2017-07-22", "authors": ["Dylan JRichards", "Robert CCoyle", "YuTan", "JiaJia", "KerriWong", "KatelynnToomer", "Donald RMenick", "YingMei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.07.021"}
{"title": "Sustained Release of a Peptide-Based Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 Inhibitor to Attenuate Adverse Cardiac Remodeling and Improve Cardiac Function Following Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Following myocardial infarction (MI), degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by upregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) especially MMP-2 decreases tissue mechanical properties, leading to cardiac function deterioration. Attenuation of cardiac ECM degradation at the early stage of MI has the potential to preserve tissue mechanical properties, resulting in cardiac function increase. Yet the strategy for efficiently preventing cardiac ECM degradation remains to be established. Current preclinical approaches have shown limited efficacy because of low drug dosage allocated to the heart tissue, dose-limiting side effects, and cardiac fibrosis. To address these limitations, we have developed a MMP-2 inhibitor delivery system that can be specifically delivered into infarcted hearts at early stage of MI to efficiently prevent MMP-2-mediated ECM degradation. The system was based on an injectable, degradable, fast gelation, and thermosensitive hydrogel, and a MMP-2 specific inhibitor, peptide CTTHWGFTLC (CTT). The use of fast gelation hydrogel allowed to completely retain CTT in the heart tissue. The system was able to release low molecular weight CTT over 4 weeks possibly due to the strong hydrogen bonding between the hydrogel and CTT. The release kinetics was modulated by amount of CTT loaded into the hydrogel, and using chondroitin sulfate and heparin that can interact with CTT and the hydrogel. Both glycosaminoglycans augmented CTT release, while heparin more greatly accelerated the release. After it was injected into the infarcted hearts for 4 weeks, the released CTT efficiently prevented cardiac ECM degradation as it not only increased tissue thickness but also preserved collagen composition similar to that in the normal heart tissue. In addition, the delivery system significantly improved cardiac function. Importantly, the delivery system did not induce cardiac fibrosis. These results demonstrate that the developed MMP-2 inhibitor delivery system has potential to efficiently reduce adverse myocardial remodeling and improve cardiac function.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2017-07-22", "authors": ["ZhaoboFan", "MinghuanFu", "ZhaobinXu", "BoZhang", "ZhihongLi", "HaichangLi", "XinyuZhou", "XuanyouLiu", "YunyanDuan", "Pei-HuiLin", "PuDuann", "XiaoyunXie", "JianjieMa", "ZhenguoLiu", "JianjunGuan"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00760"}
{"title": "Cardiac autonomic modulation induced by doxorubicin in a rodent model of colorectal cancer and the influence of fullerenol pretreatment.", "abstract": "The very effective anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) is known to have cardiotoxic side effects, which could be accompanied by autonomic modulation. Autonomic disbalance might even be an initiating mechanism underlying DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and can be studied noninvasively by the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). A number of strategies have been assessed to predict chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction while HRV, a potential detecting tool, has not yet been tested. Thus, we aimed to determine the effect of DOX treatment on HRV in a rat model of colorectal cancer. While pretreatment with fullerenol (Frl) acts protectively on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, we aimed to test the effect of Frl pretreatment on DOX-induced HRV alterations. After the induction of colorectal cancer, adult male Wistar rats were treated with saline (n = 7), DOX (1.5 mg/kg per week, n = 7) or DOX after pretreatment with Frl (25 mg/kg per week, n = 7) for three weeks (cumulative DOX dose 4.5 mg/kg). One week after treatment rats were anaesthetized, standard ECG was measured and HRV was analyzed in time and frequency domain. During autopsy the intestines and hearts were gathered for biochemical analysis and histopathological examination. DOX treatment significantly decreased parasympathetically mediated high-frequency component (p<0.05) and increased the low-frequency component of HRV (p<0.05), resulting in an increased LF/HF ratio (p<0.05) in cancerous rats. When pretreated with Frl, DOX-induced HRV alterations were prevented: the high-frequency component of HRV increased (p<0.01), the low-frequency decreased (p<0.01), LF/HF ratio decreased consequently (p<0.01) compared to DOX only treatment. In all DOX-treated animals, disbalance of oxidative status in heart tissue and early myocardial lesions were found and were significantly reduced in rats receiving Frl pretreatment. Autonomic modulation accompanied the development of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rat model of colorectal cancer and was prevented by Frl pretreatment.

Notably, characterization of these properties after implantation remains a challenge, raising the need for the development of novel quantitative imaging techniques for monitoring hydrogel implant behavior in situ. This study aims at (i) assessing the influence of hydrogel bioprinting patterns on electrical/mechanical behavior of cardiac implants based on a 3D-printing technique and (ii) investigating the potential of synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for estimating elastic modulus/impedance/porosity and microstructural features of 3D-printed cardiac implants in situ via an ex vivo study. Alginate laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells was bioprinted layer by layer, forming cardiac constructs with varying architectures. The elastic modulus, impedance, porosity, and other structural features, along with the cell viability and degradation of printed implants were examined in vitro over 25 days. Two selected cardiac constructs were surgically implanted onto the myocardium of rats and 10 days later, the rat hearts with implants were imaged ex vivo by means of PCI-CT at varying X-ray energies and CT-scan times. The elastic modulus/impedance, porosity, and structural features of the implant were inferred from the PCI-CT images by using statistical models and compared with measured values. The printing patterns had significant effects on implant porosity, elastic modulus, and impedance. A particular 3D-printing pattern with an interstrand distance of 900\u2009\u03bcm and strand alignment angle of 0/45/90/135\u00b0 provided relatively higher stiffness and electrical conductivity with a suitable porosity, maintaining high cell viability over 7 days. The X-ray photon energy of 30-33\u2009keV utilizing a CT-scan time of 1-1.2\u2009h resulted in a low-dose PCI-CT, which provided a good visibility of the low-X-ray absorbent alginate implants. After 10 days postimplantation, the PCI-CT provided a reasonably accurate estimation of implant strand thickness and alignment, pore size and interconnectivity, porosity, elastic modulus, and impedance, which were consistent with our measurements. Findings from this study suggest that 3D-printing patterns can be used to modulate electrical/mechanical behavior of alginate implants, and PCI-CT can be potentially used as a 3D quantitative imaging tool for assessing structural and electrical/mechanical behavior of hydrogel cardiac implants in small animal models.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Ridges and grooves of the template are 10\u2009\u00b5m width and depth ranging from 1 to 17\u2009\u00b5m. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Polyacrylamide (PAm) hydrogel have been chosen as soft polymers to be moulded. Thanks to their chemical and physical properties PDMS and PAm hydrogel mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). PDMS was spin coated on micropatterned Parylene C obtaining composite substrates with 460\u2009nm and 1.15\u2009\u00b5m high grooves. The Young's modulus of the composite Parylene C/PDMS was evaluated and it was found to be almost half when compared to PDMS.

To induce MI, ISO was subcutaneously injected into the rats for two consecutive days at a dosage of 85mg/kg/day. ISO-induced myocardial damage was indicated by elevated levels of cardiac specific troponin-T, enhanced myocardial expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), and increased number of cells with apoptotic and necrotic appearance in the myocardial tissue. Levels of p-Akt/Akt and p-GSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 significantly decreased in heart tissue after ISO-induced MI. However, intraperitoneal administration of nesfatin-1 (10\u03bcg/kg/day) elicited a significant cardioprotective activity by lowering the levels of cardiac troponin-T and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating the protective effect of nesfatin-1 against ISO-induced MI. The biochemical findings were further confirmed by histopathological examination, which was demonstrated by reduced number of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Moreover, expressions of p-Akt/Akt and p-GSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 in the myocardium of MI group rats were significantly increased by nesfatin-1 administration, suggesting that nesfatin-1, which appears to possess anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, may confer protection against ISO-induced MI via an Akt/GSK-3\u03b2-dependent mechanism.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2017-07-20", "authors": ["ArdaTasatargil", "NilayKuscu", "SelvinazDalaklioglu", "DileyraAdiguzel", "CilerCelik-Ozenci", "SebahatOzdem", "AyseBarutcigil", "SadiOzdem"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2017.07.003"}

The increasing number of in vivo and in vitro studies using high throughput proteomics provide estimates of the protein half-lives in tissues and cells. However, protein half-lives in cells and tissues are different. Due to the resource requirements for researching tissues, more data is available from cellular studies than tissues. We have designed a multivariate linear model for predicting protein half-life in tissue from its cellular properties. Inputs to the model are cellular half-life, abundance, intrinsically disordered sequences, and transcriptional and translational rates. Before the modeling, we determined substructures in the data using the relative distance from the regression line of the protein half-lives in tissues and cells, identifying three separate clusters. The model was trained on and applied to predict protein half-lives from murine liver, brain and heart tissues. In each tissue type we observed similar prediction patterns of protein half-lives. We found that the model provides the best results when there is a strong correlation between tissue and cell culture protein half-lives. Additionally, we clustered the protein half-lives to determine variations in correlation coefficients between the protein half-lives in the tissue versus in cell culture. The clusters identify strongly and weakly correlated protein half-lives, further improves the overall prediction and identifies sub groupings which exhibit specific characteristics.

{"title": "Therapeutic Efficacy of the Novel Stimuli-Sensitive Nano-Ferritins Containing Doxorubicin in a Head and Neck Cancer Model.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is employed alone or in combination for the treatment of several hematological and solid malignancies; despite its efficacy, there are associated cardiotoxicity limits both in its application in patients with heart disease risk factors and also in its long-term use. HFt-MP-PAS40 is a genetically engineered human ferritin heavy chain (HFt)-based construct able to efficiently entrap and deliver doxorubicin to cancer cells. HF-MP-PAS contains a short motif sequence (defined as MP) responsive to proteolytic cleavage by tumor matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), located between each HFt subunit and a masking polypeptide sequence rich in proline (P), alanine (A), and serine (S) residues (PAS). This carrier displayed excellent therapeutic efficacy in a xenogenic pancreatic cancer model in vivo, leading to a significant increase in overall animal survival in treated mice. Herein, we describe the HFt-MP-PAS40-Dox efficacy against squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) with the goal of validating the application of our nano-drug for the treatment of different solid tumors. In addition, a tolerability study in healthy mice was also performed. The results indicate that HFt-MP-PAS40-Dox produced increased anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo in comparison to the free drug in several HNSCC cell lines. In the acute toxicity studies, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HFt-MP-PAS40-Dox was about 3.5 higher than the free drug: 25 mg/kg versus 7 mg/kg doxorubicin equivalents. Importantly, evaluation of heart tissues provided evidence that doxorubicin is less cardio-toxic when encapsulated inside the ferritin carrier. In conclusion, HFt-MP-PAS40-Dox may be administered safely at higher doses compared with the free drug, resulting in superior efficacy to control HNSCC malignancies.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2017-07-19", "authors": ["VerenaDamiani", "ElisabettaFalvo", "GiulioFracasso", "LucaFederici", "MartinaPitea", "VincenzoDe Laurenzi", "GianlucaSala", "PierpaoloCeci"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms18071555\n10.1039/c3nr04268e\n10.1039/C3TB20081G\n10.1073/pnas.1407808111\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01446\n10.1166/jbn.2012.1406\n10.1021/nn305791q\n10.1002/adhm.201500226\n10.3390/ijms140713391\n10.2217/nnm.14.119\n10.1016/j.phrs.2016.03.002\n10.1039/c0nr01013h\n10.1021/acs.biomac.5b00435\n10.1016/j.addr.2016.03.002\n10.1039/C4NR00915K\n10.1038/nnano.2012.90\n10.1073/pnas.0913192107\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.08.010\n10.3322/caac.21387\n10.1200/JCO.2005.01.5867\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.10.002\n10.1073/pnas.0607705103\n10.18632/oncotarget.14204"}

Using a Monte Carlo model, we obtained a simple empirical formula linking the rate of the fast exponent to the scattering coefficient, the anisotropy parameter g, and the numerical aperture of the probe.

{"title": "Exploring the mitochondrial microRNA import pathway through Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase).", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. During the diabetic condition, cardiovascular dysfunction can be partially attributed to molecular changes in the tissue, including alterations in microRNA (miRNA) interactions. MiRNAs have been reported in the mitochondrion and their presence may influence cellular bioenergetics, creating decrements in functional capacity. In this study, we examined the roles of Argonaute 2 (Ago2), a protein associated with cytosolic and mitochondrial miRNAs, and Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase), a protein found in the inner membrane space of the mitochondrion, to determine their role in mitochondrial miRNA import. In cardiac tissue from human and mouse models of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Ago2 protein levels were unchanged while PNPase protein expression levels were increased; also, there was an increase in the association between both proteins in the diabetic state. MiRNA-378 was found to be significantly increased in db/db mice, leading to decrements in ATP6 levels and ATP synthase activity, which was also exhibited when overexpressing PNPase in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and in HL-1 cells with stable miRNA-378 overexpression (HL-1-378). To assess potential therapeutic interventions, flow cytometry evaluated the capacity for targeting miRNA-378 species in mitochondria through antimiR treatment, revealing miRNA-378 level-dependent inhibition. Our study establishes PNPase as a contributor to mitochondrial miRNA import through the transport of miRNA-378, which may regulate bioenergetics during type 2 diabetes mellitus.

J17, a molecule with structural similarities to curcumin, exhibited good anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages. However, its ability to alleviate hyperglycemia-induced injury via its anti-inflammatory actions remained unclear. Thus, we reported that J17 exerts significant inhibitory effects on hyperglycemia-induced inflammation and fibrosis in NRK-52E cells, H9C2 cells and a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. We also found that the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis activities of J17 are associated with the inhibition of the P38 and AKT signal pathway, respectively. In vivo oral administration of J17 suppressed hyperglycemia-induced inflammation, hypertrophy and fibrosis, thereby reducing key markers for renal and cardiac dysfunction and improving in fibrosis and pathological changes in both renal and cardiac tissues of diabetic mice.

However, the tumor risk associated with residual undifferentiated cells remains an important safety concern of iPSC-based therapies. This concern is not satisfactorily addressed in xenotransplantation, which requires immune suppression of the transplanted animal. In this study, we assessed the safety of transplanting undifferentiated iPSCs in an allogeneic setting. Given that swine are commonly used as large animal models in cardiac medicine, we used porcine iPSCs (p-iPSCs) in conjunction with bioengineered constructs that support recovery after acute myocardial infarction. Histopathology analyses found no evidence of p-iPSCs or p-iPSC-derived cells within the host myocardium or biomatrices after 30 and 90 days of follow-up. Consistent with the disappearance of the implanted cells, we could not observe functional benefit of these treatments in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, ventricular volumes, or necrosis.

{"title": "The effects of kisspeptin-10 on serum metabolism and myocardium in rats.", "abstract": "Kisspeptin is a peptide encoded by the Kiss 1 gene and is also called metastin. Previous studies have generally focused on several functions of this peptide, including metastasis, puberty, vasoconstriction and reproduction. However, few studies have focused on the cardiac functions of kisspeptin. In the present study, cardiac histomorphology was observed via TEM (transmission electron microscope) and HE and Masson staining to observe instinctive changes. Serum metabolites levels were also measured and analyzed using GC/TOF-MS after injection with kisspeptin-10. A gene chip was employed to screen the potential genes and pathways in the myocardium at the transcriptional leve, while RT-PCR and Western Blot were conducted to verify the relevant mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Histopathological findings demonstrated that there were many irregular wavy contractions through HE staining and increased fibrosis around the heart cells through Masson staining after treatment with kisspeptin-10. Additionally, the main changes in ultrastructure, including changes in mitochondrial and broken mitochondrial cristae, could be observed with TEM after treatment with kisspeptin-10. The PCA scores plot of the serum metabolites was in the apparent partition after injection of kisspeptin-10. Twenty-six obviously changed metabolites were detected and classified as amino acids, carbohydrate metabolites, organic acids and other metabolites. Furthermore, gene chip analysis showed 1112 differentially expressed genes after treatment with kisspeptin-10, including 330 up-regulated genes and 782 down-regulated genes. These genes were enriched in several signaling pathways related to heart diseases. The RT-PCR result for ITGB8, ITGA4, ITGB7, MYL7, HIF1-\u03b1 and BNP corresponded with the gene chip assay. Moreover, the upregulated genes ITGB8, ITGA4 and BNP also displayed consistent protein levels in Western Blot results. In summary, these findings suggest that kisspeptin-10 could alter the morphology and structure of myocardial cells, serum metabolite levels, and expression of genes and proteins in heart tissues.

{"title": "HIV-Associated Cardiovascular Disease: Role of Connexin 43.", "abstract": "Chronic HIV infection due to effective antiretroviral treatment has resulted in a broad range of clinical complications, including accelerated heart disease. Individuals with HIV infection have a 1.5 to 2 times higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases than their uninfected counterparts; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To explore the link between HIV infection and cardiovascular diseases, we used postmortem human heart tissues obtained from HIV-infected and control uninfected individuals to examine connexin 43 (Cx43) expression and distribution and HIV-associated inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that Cx43 is dysregulated in the hearts of HIV-infected individuals. In all HIV heart samples analyzed, there were areas where Cx43 was overexpressed and found along the lateral membrane of the cardiomyocyte and in the intercalated disks. Areas of HIV tissue with anomalous Cx43 expression and localization also showed calcium overload, sarcofilamental atrophy, and accumulation of collagen. All these changes were independent of viral replication, CD4 counts, inflammation, and type of antiretroviral treatment. Overall, we propose that HIV infection increases Cx43 expression in heart, resulting in tissue damage that likely contributes to the high rates of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2017-07-09", "authors": ["LisaPrevedel", "CamillaMorocho", "Michael V LBennett", "Eliseo AEugenin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2017.05.011"}
{"title": "A Novel Role for CAMKK1 in the Regulation of the Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome.", "abstract": "Transplantation of adult stem cells into myocardial tissue after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), has been shown to improve tissue recovery and prevent progression to ischemic cardiomyopathy. Studies suggest that the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are due to paracrine factors released by MSC, as the benefits of MSC can be achieved through delivery of conditioned media (CM) alone. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of Dab2 enhances MSC cardiac protein expression and improves cardiac function after AMI following MSC engraftment. In order to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate MSC secretome, we analyzed gene arrays in MSC following downregulation of Dab2 via TGF\u03b21 pretreatment or transfection with Dab2:siRNA or miR-145. We identified 23 genes whose expressions were significantly changed in all three conditions. Among these genes, we have initially focused our validation and functional work on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-1 (CAMKK1). We quantified the effects of CAMKK1 overexpression in MSC following injection of CM after AMI.

The decellularization procedures proved substantially different. Specifically, only three, of the five protocols tested, proved effective in producing thoroughly acellular d-ECM.

Animals received oral administration of crocin (50 mg/kg) or performed voluntary exercise alone or together for 8 weeks. Akt, ERK1/2 protein levels, miR-126 and miR-210 expression were measured in the heart tissue. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect CD31 in the heart tissue.\nAkt and ERK1/2 levels of the heart tissue were higher in crocin treated group and voluntary exercise trained group after 8 weeks.

We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation.\nCardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.\nThe combination of HU and \u03b3-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose \u03b3-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in \u03b1-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.\nThis study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate \u03b3-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions.

{"title": "Ablation as targeted perturbation to rewire communication network of persistent atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) can be viewed as disintegrated patterns of information transmission by action potential across the communication network consisting of nodes linked by functional connectivity. To test the hypothesis that ablation of persistent AF is associated with improvement in both local and global connectivity within the communication networks, we analyzed multi-electrode basket catheter electrograms of 22 consecutive patients (63.5 \u00b1 9.7 years, 78% male) during persistent AF before and after the focal impulse and rotor modulation-guided ablation. Eight patients (36%) developed recurrence within 6 months after ablation. We defined communication networks of AF by nodes (cardiac tissue adjacent to each electrode) and edges (mutual information between pairs of nodes). To evaluate patient-specific parameters of communication, thresholds of mutual information were applied to preserve 10% to 30% of the strongest edges. There was no significant difference in network parameters between both atria at baseline. Ablation effectively rewired the communication network of persistent AF to improve the overall connectivity. In addition, successful ablation improved local connectivity by increasing the average clustering coefficient, and also improved global connectivity by decreasing the characteristic path length. As a result, successful ablation improved the efficiency and robustness of the communication network by increasing the small-world index. These changes were not observed in patients with AF recurrence. Furthermore, a significant increase in the small-world index after ablation was associated with synchronization of the rhythm by acute AF termination. In conclusion, successful ablation rewires communication networks during persistent AF, making it more robust, efficient, and easier to synchronize. Quantitative analysis of communication networks provides not only a mechanistic insight that AF may be sustained by spatially localized sources and global connectivity, but also patient-specific metrics that could serve as a valid endpoint for therapeutic interventions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-07-06", "authors": ["SusumuTao", "Samuel FWay", "JoshuaGarland", "JonathanChrispin", "Luisa ACiuffo", "Muhammad ABalouch", "SamanNazarian", "David DSpragg", "Joseph EMarine", "Ronald DBerger", "HughCalkins", "HiroshiAshikaga"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0179459\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1001/jama.2009.2029\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.12.016\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000041\n10.1056/NEJMoa1408288\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl548\n10.1093/europace/eun029\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000146917.75041.58\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2005.50192.x\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001943\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.08.067\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2005.12.022\n10.1098/rsif.2014.1201\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.019893\n10.1152/physrev.00031.2009\n10.1001/jama.2014.3\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.054101\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.014101\n10.1016/j.tins.2004.02.007\n10.1007/s00422-004-0471-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1509-04.2004\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.198101\n10.1038/30918\n10.1016/j.schres.2007.05.029\n10.1093/brain/awn018\n10.1016/j.schres.2006.06.028\n10.1002/hbm.20517\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025423\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.05.022\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2012.02332.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.11.011\n10.1161/CIRCEP.115.002721\n10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138\n10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-040510-143934\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002051\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.976654\n10.1093/europace/eum194\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.04.009\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.158101\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166972\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.03.019\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.02.034\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147781.02738.13\n10.1161/CIRCEP.109.910125\n10.1038/415219a\n10.1111/jce.12088\n10.1093/cercor/bhj127\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000100\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4623-06.2007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014371\n10.1007/s00422-003-0425-7\n10.1038/nrn1650\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.461"}

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), fibroblasts (FB) and endothelial cells (EC) were aggregated to create mixed cell spheroids. Cardiac patches were created from spheroids (CM:FB:EC\u2009=\u200970:15:15, 70:0:30, 45:40:15) using a 3D bioprinter. Cardiac patches were analyzed with light and video microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell viability assays and optical electrical mapping. Cardiac tissue patches of all cell ratios beat spontaneously after 3D bioprinting. Patches exhibited ventricular-like action potential waveforms and uniform electrical conduction throughout the patch. Conduction velocities were higher and action potential durations were significantly longer in patches containing a lower percentage of FBs. Immunohistochemistry revealed staining for CM, FB and EC markers, with rudimentary CD31+ blood vessel formation.

CVD is more prevalent in type 2 diabetes (T2D) than type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the mortality risk is higher in T1D than in T2D. The pathophysiology of CVD in T1D is poorly defined. To learn more about biological pathways that are potentially involved in T1D with cardiac dysfunction, we sought to identify differentially expressed genes in the T1D heart. Our study used T1D mice with severe hyperglycemia along with significant deficits in echocardiographic measurements. Microarray analysis of heart tissue RNA revealed that the T1D mice differentially expressed 10 genes compared to control. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we showed that these genes were significantly involved in ketogenesis, cardiovascular disease, apoptosis and other toxicology functions. Of these 10 genes, the 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 2 (HMGCS2) was the highest upregulated gene in T1D heart. IPA analysis showed that HMGCS2 was center to many biological networks and pathways. Our data also suggested that apart from heart, the expression of HMGCS2 was also different in kidney and spleen between control and STZ treated mice.

We induced pressure overload (PO) in mice and found that lipocalin-2 knockout (LKO) mice exhibited less PO-induced autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation than Wt. PO-induced mitochondrial damage was reduced and autophagic flux greater in LKO mice, which correlated with less cardiac dysfunction. All of these observations were negated upon adenoviral-mediated restoration of normal lipocalin-2 levels in LKO. Studies in primary cardiac fibroblasts indicated that lipocalin-2 enhanced priming and activation of NLRP3-inflammasome, detected by increased IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and Caspase-1 activation. This was attenuated in cells isolated from NLRP3-deficient mice or upon pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3. Furthermore, lipocalin-2 induced release of HMGB1 from cells and NLRP3-inflammasome activation was attenuated by TLR4 inhibition. We also found evidence of increased inflammasome activation and reduced autophagy in cardiac biopsy samples from heart failure patients.

{"title": "Electrotaxis of cardiac progenitor cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells requires serum and is directed via PI3'K pathways.", "abstract": "The limited regenerative capacity of cardiac tissue has long been an obstacle to treating damaged myocardium. Cell-based therapy offers an enormous potential to the current treatment paradigms. However, the efficacy of regenerative therapies remains limited by inefficient delivery and engraftment. Electrotaxis (electrically guided cell movement) has been clinically used to improve recovery in a number of tissues but has not been investigated for treating myocardial damage.\nThe purpose of this study was to test the electrotactic behaviors of several types of cardiac cells.\nCardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hiPSC-CPCs) were used.\nCPCs and CFs electrotax toward the anode of a direct current electric field, whereas hiPSC-CPCs electrotax toward the cathode. The voltage-dependent electrotaxis of CPCs and CFs requires the presence of serum in the media. Addition of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule to serum-free media restores directed migration. We provide evidence that CPC and CF electrotaxis is mediated through phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase signaling. In addition, very late antigen-4, an integrin and growth factor receptor, is required for electrotaxis and localizes to the anodal edge of CPCs in response to direct current electric field. The hiPSC-derived CPCs do not express very late antigen-4, migrate toward the cathode in a voltage-dependent manner, and, similar to CPCs and CFs, require media serum and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase activity for electrotaxis.\nThe electrotactic behaviors of these therapeutic cardiac cells may be used to improve cell-based therapy for recovering function in damaged myocardium.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2017-07-03", "authors": ["Bert JFrederich", "ValeriyTimofeyev", "Phung NThai", "Michael JHaddad", "Adam JPoe", "Victor CLau", "MaryamMoshref", "Anne AKnowlton", "PadminiSirish", "NipavanChiamvimonvat"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.06.038"}
{"title": "The Innate Immune Response in Myocardial Infarction, Repair, and Regeneration.", "abstract": "Following myocardial infarction (MI), resident innate immune cells such as macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, and mast cells rapidly coordinate their function to contain inflammation by removing dying cells and promoting cardiomyocyte replenishment. To sustain local tissue repair functions, hematopoietic progenitors are mobilized from the bone marrow to the spleen to generate subsequent myeloid cells such as monocytes and neutrophils, which are rapidly recruited at the site of MI. A finely tuned balance between local adaptation and recruitment controls the overall outcome of the cardiac tissue regeneration versus repair and scar formation.In this chapter, the (potential) roles of the innate immune system residing in the heart are discussed in the context of recent findings about macrophage ontogeny and their homeostasis with circulating monocytes during cardiac tissue growth and after myocardial infarction. Their interactions with other members of the innate immune system are also discussed with a particular emphasis on the potential involvement of mast cells and innate lymphoid cells during MI, largely underestimated until recently.

{"title": "Immune-Mediated Heart Disease.", "abstract": "The heart involvement in systemic autoimmune diseases represents a growing burden for patients and health systems. Cardiac function can be impaired as a consequence of systemic conditions and manifests with threatening clinical pictures or chronic myocardial damage. Direct injuries are mediated by the presence of inflammatory infiltrate which, even though unusual, is one of the most danger manifestations requiring prompt recognition and treatment. On the other hand, a not well-managed inflammatory status leads to accelerated atherosclerosis that precipitates ischemic disease. All cardiac structures may be damaged with different grades of intensity; moreover, lesions can appear simultaneously or more frequently at a short distance from each other leading to the onset of varied clinical pictures. The pathogenesis of heart damages in systemic autoimmune conditions is not yet completely understood for the great part of situations, even if several mechanisms have been investigated. The principal biochemical circuits refer to the damaging role of autoantibodies on cardiac tissues and the precipitation of immune complexes on endocardium. These events are finally responsible of inflammatory infiltration which leads to subsequent worsening of the previous damage. For these reasons, it appears of paramount importance a regular and deepened cardiovascular assessment to prevent a progressive evolution toward heart failure in patient affected by autoimmune diseases.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2017-07-02", "authors": ["ElenaGenerali", "MarcoFolci", "CarloSelmi", "PiersandroRiboldi"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-57613-8_8"}

A small number of noncomprehensive profiling studies based on human cardiac tissues have been conducted and reported; consequently, ARVC's gene expression pattern characteristics remain largely undocumented. Our study applies large-scaled, quantitative proteomics based on TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS to analyze the left and right ventricular myocardium of four ARVC and four DCM explanted hearts to compare them with normal hearts. Our objective is to reveal the characteristic proteome pattern in ARVC compared with DCM as well as nondiseased heart. We also conducted the RNA sequencing of 10 right ventricles from ARVC hearts paired with four nondiseased donor hearts to validate the proteome results. In a manner similar to that of the well-defined DCM heart failure model, the ARVC model demonstrates the downregulation of mitochondrial function proteins and the effects of many heart failure regulators such as TGFB, RICTOR, and KDM5A. In addition, the inflammatory signaling, especially the complement system, was activated much more severely in ARVC than in DCM. Our most significant discovery was the lipid metabolism reprogramming of both ARVC ventricles in accordance with the upregulation of lipogenesis factors such as FABP4 and FASN. We identified the key upstream regulator of lipogenesis as C/EBP\u03b1. Transcriptome profiling verified the consistency with proteome alterations. This comprehensive proteogenomics profiling study reveals that an activation of C/EBP\u03b1, along with the upregulation of its lipogenesis targets, accounts for lipid storage and acts as a hallmark of ARVC.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["LiangChen", "FanYang", "XiaoChen", "ManRao", "Ning-NingZhang", "KaiChen", "HaiTengDeng", "Jiang-PingSong", "Sheng-ShouHu"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00165"}
{"title": "Potential of propagation-based synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast computed tomography for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Hydrogel-based cardiac tissue engineering offers great promise for myocardial infarction repair. The ability to visualize engineered systems in vivo in animal models is desired to monitor the performance of cardiac constructs. However, due to the low density and weak X-ray attenuation of hydrogels, conventional radiography and micro-computed tomography are unable to visualize the hydrogel cardiac constructs upon their implantation, thus limiting their use in animal systems. This paper presents a study on the optimization of synchrotron X-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for three-dimensional (3D) visualization and assessment of the hydrogel cardiac patches. First, alginate hydrogel was 3D-printed into cardiac patches, with the pores filled by fibrin. The hydrogel patches were then surgically implanted on rat hearts. A week after surgery, the hearts including patches were excised and embedded in a soft-tissue-mimicking gel for imaging by using PCI-CT at an X-ray energy of 25\u2005keV. During imaging, the sample-to-detector distances, CT-scan time and the region of interest (ROI) were varied and examined for their effects on both imaging quality and radiation dose. The results showed that phase-retrieved PCI-CT images provided edge-enhancement fringes at a sample-to-detector distance of 147\u2005cm that enabled visualization of anatomical and microstructural features of the myocardium and the implanted patch in the tissue-mimicking gel. For visualization of these features, PCI-CT offered a significantly higher performance than the dual absorption-phase and clinical magnetic resonance (3\u2005T) imaging techniques. Furthermore, by reducing the total CT-scan time and ROI, PCI-CT was examined for lowering the effective dose, meanwhile without much loss of imaging quality. In effect, the higher soft tissue contrast and low-dose potential of PCI-CT has been used along with an acceptable overall animal dose to achieve the high spatial resolution needed for cardiac implant visualization. As a result, PCI-CT at the identified imaging parameters offers great potential for 3D assessment of microstructural features of hydrogel cardiac patches.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["MohammadIzadifar", "PaulBabyn", "DeanChapman", "Michael EKelly", "XiongbiaoChen"], "doi": "10.1107/S1600577517006208"}

Herein, we developed conductive nanofibrous sheets with electrical conductivity and nanofibrous structure composed of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) blending with polyaniline (PANI) for cardiac tissue engineering and cardiomyocytes-based 3D bioactuators. Incorporating of varying contents of PANI from 0wt% to 3wt% into the PLA polymer, the electrospun nanofibrous sheets showed enhanced conductivity while maintaining the same fiber diameter. These PLA/PANI conductive nanofibrous sheets exhibited good cell viability and promoting effect on differentiation of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts in terms of maturation index and fusion index. Moreover, PLA/PANI nanofibrous sheets enhanced the cell-cell interaction, maturation and spontaneous beating of primary cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the cardiomyocytes-laden PLA/PANI conductive nanofibrous sheets can form 3D bioactuators with tubular and folding shapes, and spontaneously beat with much higher frequency and displacement than that on cardiomyocytes-laden PLA nanofibrous sheets. Therefore, these PLA/PANI conductive nanofibrous sheets with conductivity and extracellular matrix like nanostructure demonstrated promising potential in cardiac tissue engineering and cardiomyocytes-based 3D bioactuators.\nCardiomyocytes-based bioactuators have been paid more attention due to their spontaneous motion by integrating cardiomyocytes into polymer structures, but developing suitable scaffolds for bioactuators remains challenging. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have been widely used in cardiac tissue engineering because they can mimic the extracellular matrix of myocardium. Developing conductive nanofibrous scaffolds by electrospinning would be beneficial for cardiomyocytes-based bioactuators, but such scaffolds have been rarely reported.

Cataract prevalence ranged from 20% to 100%, with the highest average score of 7.3 (max 8) and incidences of severe cataract (>5) in all groups. Cataract could not be explained by suboptimal histidine concentrations in the feed. Neither muscle nor cardiac tissues had concentrations of free histidine compounds. The lumpfish lens contained N-acetylhistidine (NAH), of which low concentrations were strongly related to cataract severity. However, no correlation between lens NAH and cataract severity was found in the present sample set. Wild lumpfish had higher levels compared to farmed lumpfish, suggesting that the farmed lumpfish may have been deficient in histidine or have a higher utilization of NAH due to osmotic problems. Thus, cataract in farmed lumpfish may be related to primary or secondary disturbed nutrient metabolism or malnutrition, shown by the high levels of specific amino acids in different tissues, which may cause osmotic imbalance and cataract development.

This is transforming biomedical research into a big data discipline, where the main challenges relate to the analysis and interpretation of data into new biological knowledge. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for biomedical big data analytics, and apply it for analyzing transcriptomics time series data from early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards the mesoderm and cardiac lineages. To this end, transcriptome profiling by microarray was performed on differentiating human pluripotent stem cells sampled at eleven consecutive days. The gene expression data was analyzed using the five-stage analysis framework proposed in this study, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, confirmatory analysis, biological knowledge discovery, and visualization of the results. Clustering analysis revealed several distinct expression profiles during differentiation. Genes with an early transient response were strongly related to embryonic- and mesendoderm development, for example CER1 and NODAL. Pluripotency genes, such as NANOG and SOX2, exhibited substantial downregulation shortly after onset of differentiation. Rapid induction of genes related to metal ion response, cardiac tissue development, and muscle contraction were observed around day five and six. Several transcription factors were identified as potential regulators of these processes, e.g. POU1F1, TCF4 and TBP for muscle contraction genes. Pathway analysis revealed temporal activity of several signaling pathways, for example the inhibition of WNT signaling on day 2 and its reactivation on day 4. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of biological events and key regulators of the early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards the mesoderm and cardiac lineages.

Xinji'erkang (XJEK) has been clinically used as an effective medication in the treatment of coronary heart disease and myocarditis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effect of Xinji'erkang on MI mice.\nForty male mice were randomly assigned into four groups as follows (n\u00a0=\u00a010): sham, model, MI with administration of XJEK and fosinopril for four weeks. At the end of studies, hemodynamic parameters and electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded. Heart and body mass were measured and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio was calculated as index of hypertrophy. The hypertrophy of heart and aorta was examined using the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and the collagen deposition was evaluated using Van Gieson (VG) staining. Serum nitric oxide level (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were assayed by colorimetric analysis. The expressions of endothelial NO synthetase (eNOS) expression in serum and cardiac tissues were determined using ELISA assay and immunohistochemistry. Angiotensin II (Ang II) in serum and cardiac tissues was measured using ELISA assay. Besides, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin10 (IL-10) were observed in cardiac tissues with ELISA assay as well.\nThe administration of XJEK significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and abnormal ECG with reduced HW/BW ratio and ameliorated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition compared to MI, which was partly due to the decreased SOD and increased MDA in serum. Moreover, XJEK treatment also improved endothelial dysfunction (ED) with not only enhanced eNOS activities in serum and cardiac tissues and elevated NO levels in serum, but also decreased Ang II content in serum and cardiac tissues. Finally, protein expressions of pro-inflammation cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the cardiac tissues with XJEK treatment were significantly decreased compared to model. On the contrary, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrated in cardiac tissues was significantly enhanced compared to model.\nXinji'erkang exerts cardioprotective effect on myocardial infarction in mice, which may be due to the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation response.", "journal": "BMC complementary and alternative medicine", "date": "2017-06-28", "authors": ["JuanHu", "Yong-XueZhang", "LiWang", "LingDing", "Guang-YaoHuang", "Guo-WeiCai", "ShanGao"], "doi": "10.1186/s12906-017-1846-5\n10.1177/1074248413499973\n10.2174/092986711795496755\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.05.027\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.8.899\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226803\n10.1093/cvr/cvn335\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.3.755\n10.21037/atm.2016.07.06\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.07.006\n10.1186/1472-6882-13-173\n10.3736/jcim20120313\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.10.018\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.08.003\n10.1056/NEJMcp003331\n10.1161/01.RES.87.3.241\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000055318.09997.1F\n10.1023/B:HREV.0000011393.40674.13\n10.1161/01.RES.0000047090.08299.D5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000130526.20854.fa\n10.1007/s13246-011-0099-8\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.03.007\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000109499.00587.FF\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2014.02.004\n10.1074/jbc.M201961200\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2014.04.009\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.05.011\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.68.040104.124629\n10.4068/cmj.2016.52.2.81\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.742692\n10.5603/FHC.2011.0070\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.06.011\n10.1038/srep43920\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.002\n10.1002/ptr.4793\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0789\n10.1073/pnas.95.8.4556\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.002\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.024\n10.1152/ajplung.00378.2002\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.197301\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.08.023\n10.1038/srep05335\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303697\n10.1007/s10528-007-9130-x\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-102\n10.1002/oby.20242\n10.1155/2008/210609"}

MI was produced by administering isoproterenol (90mg/kg/day, i.p.) in rats for two consecutive days. all the animals were divided in to four groups such as control group receives only saline; MI group which receives only isoproterenol and crocetin treated group which receives crocetin (50, 100 and 200mg/kg/day, p.o.) for the duration of 15 days. At the end of dosing left ventricular functions was assessed to estimate its effect on cardiac functions. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and inflammatory cytokines were determined in the cardiac tissue homogenate. Histopathology study was also carried out using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry was done for the estimation of Caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax and Nrf-2 level in the myocardial tissues of MI rats. Result of the study suggested that GSH, CAT, CK-MB, and LDH were (p<0.01) increased in the tissue homogenate of crocetin treated group than MI group. However crocetin significantly (p<0.01) decreases the level of MDA and activity of SOD in the tissue homogenate than MI group. It was observed that treatment with crocetin attenuates the level of inflammatory cytokines in the myocardial tissues of MI rats. Moreover level of caspase-3, Bax and Nrf-2 significantly reduced and Bcl-2 enhanced in the myocardial tissues of MI rats than MI group. The altered cellular architecture of heart tissue sections in the myocardial infracted rats were reversed by administration of crocetin treatment. Taking all these data together, it may be suggested that the crocetin act as a possible protective agent in myocardial infarction by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines and thereby attenuates the apoptosis of myocardial cells.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2017-06-27", "authors": ["WeiliZhang", "YuhuiLi", "ZhimingGe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.06.032"}

Masson's Trichrome staining was applied to evaluate myocardial fibrosis. Collagen deposition was determined by the mRNA level of Collagen I, Collagen III and \u03b1-SMA using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Myocardial apoptosis was examined by the protein level of Bax, Bcl2 and the Bcl2/Bax ratio using western blotting.\nThese mice displayed a significant reduction in heart function, increased myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis, and decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) in the heart tissue, which could be reversed by QLQX treatment. Inhibition of PPAR reduced QLQX-mediated cardio-protective effects, while PPAR\u03b3 activation did not further enhance the beneficial effect of QLQX. Furthermore, QLQX upregulated 9 genes (Cd36, Fatp, Pdk4, Acadm, Acadl, Acadvl, Cpt1a, Cpt1b and Cpt2) facilitating energy metabolism in the MI hearts of the OVX mice and 5 (Acadm, Acadl, Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2) of the 9 genes were the downstream targets of PPAR\u03b3.\nThe present study indicates that QLQX has a treatment effect on pathological remodeling post MI in bilateral OVX female mice via activation of PPAR\u03b3, suggesting that QLQX may be a promising prescription for the treatment of postmenopausal women suffering from MI.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2017-06-26", "authors": ["ShutongShen", "HuiminJiang", "YihuaBei", "JialiangZhang", "HaifengZhang", "HongshengZhu", "ChenlinZhang", "WenmingYao", "CongWei", "HongcaiShang", "XinliLi"], "doi": "10.1159/000478641"}

However, the relative effects of hMSC-mediated heterocellular coupling (HC) and paracrine signaling (PS) on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity remain unresolved.\nThe objective is to better understand hMSC PS and HC effects on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity by integrating experimental and computational approaches.\nExtending our previous hMSC-cardiomyocyte HC computational model, we incorporated experimentally calibrated hMSC PS effects on cardiomyocyte L-type calcium channel/sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase activity and cardiac tissue fibrosis. Excitation-contraction simulations of hMSC PS-only and combined HC+PS effects on human cardiomyocytes were representative of human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) contractile function measurements under matched experimental treatments. Model simulations and hECTs both demonstrated that hMSC-mediated effects were most pronounced under PS-only conditions, where developed force increased \u22484-fold compared with non-hMSC-supplemented controls during physiological 1-Hz pacing. Simulations predicted contractility of isolated healthy and ischemic adult human cardiomyocytes would be minimally sensitive to hMSC HC, driven primarily by PS. Dominance of hMSC PS was also revealed in simulations of fibrotic cardiac tissue, where hMSC PS protected from potential proarrhythmic effects of HC at various levels of engraftment. Finally, to study the nature of the hMSC paracrine effects on contractility, proteomic analysis of hECT/hMSC conditioned media predicted activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, a recognized target of both soluble and exosomal fractions of the hMSC secretome. Treating hECTs with exosome-enriched, but not exosome-depleted, fractions of the hMSC secretome recapitulated the effects observed with hMSC conditioned media on hECT-developed force and expression of calcium-handling genes (eg, SERCA2a, L-type calcium channel).\nCollectively, this integrated experimental and computational study helps unravel relative hMSC PS and HC effects on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity, and provides novel insight into the role of exosomes in hMSC paracrine-mediated effects on contractility.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2017-06-24", "authors": ["JoshuaMayourian", "Timothy JCashman", "Delaine KCeholski", "Bryce VJohnson", "DavidSachs", "Deepak AKaji", "SusmitaSahoo", "Joshua MHare", "Roger JHajjar", "Eric ASobie", "Kevin DCosta"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310796"}

We have developed a baboon model of moderate maternal undernutrition, leading to IUGR. We hypothesized that the IUGR affects fetal cardiac structure and metabolism. Six control pregnant baboons ate ad-libitum (CTRL)) or 70% CTRL from 0.16 of gestation (G). Fetuses were euthanized at C-section at 0.9G under general anesthesia. Male but not female IUGR fetuses showed left ventricular fibrosis inversely correlated with birth weight. Expression of extracellular matrix protein TSP-1 was increased (p<0.05) in male IUGR. Expression of cardiac fibrotic markers TGF\u03b2, SMAD3 and ALK-1 were downregulated in male IUGRs with no difference in females. Autophagy was present in male IUGR evidenced by upregulation of ATG7 expression and lipidation LC3B. Global miRNA expression profiling revealed 56 annotated and novel cardiac miRNAs exclusively dysregulated in female IUGR, and 38 cardiac miRNAs were exclusively dysregulated in males (p<0.05). Fifteen (CTRL) and 23 (IUGR) miRNAs, were differentially expressed between males and females (p<0.05) suggesting sexual dimorphism, which can be at least partially explained by differential expression of upstream transcription factors (e.g. HNF4\u03b1, and NF\u03baB p50). Lipidomics analysis of fetal cardiac tissue exhibited a net increase in diacylglycerol and plasmalogens and a decrease in triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines. In summary, IUGR resulting from decreased maternal nutrition is associated with sex-dependent dysregulations in cardiac structure, miRNA expression, and lipid metabolism.

Nevertheless, lack of new studies concerning side effects associated with their chronic administration seems to be rather confusing. In our previous research, we proved that the main furnidipines' metabolite (M-2) possess multiple cardioprotective actions. Currently, we compared effects of post-infarction long-term oral treatment with M-2 and captopril on hemodynamic parameters and \"ischemic cardiomyopathy\" development in rats. Myocardial infarction was evoked by permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 35 days. Surviving rats were treated with captopril (2 \u00d7 25 mg/kg) or M-2 (4 mg/kg) from 6th- 35th day. At 35th day rats' hearts were tested on working heart setup, where following parameters were measured: heart rate, preload pressure, aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, aortic maximum rise and fall, aortic and coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption and oximetry in perfusate. Subsequently, heart tissue specimens were assessed during morphological estimation. Captopril caused significant heart rate increase and markedly diminished preload pressure in comparison to M-2. Both drugs evoked essential aortic pressure increase. Aortic flow was significantly decreased after M-2, whereas captopril increased this parameter in comparison to M-2. Both agents caused marked coronary flow increase. Morphologic examination in captopril revealed cardiomyopathic process in 70% of hearts, whereas in M-2 this value reached 30%. Neovascularization of post-infarcted myocardium was visible only after M-2 therapy. Concluding, M-2 presented itself as more attractive agent in long-term post-infarction treatment by preventing cardiomyopathy development, angiogenesis stimulation and preserving cardiac performance.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-06-22", "authors": ["Katarzyna AMitr\u0119ga", "Adrianna MSpa\u0142ek", "JerzyNo\u017cy\u0144ski", "MaurycyPorc", "MagdalenaStankiewicz", "Tadeusz FKrzemi\u0144ski"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0179633\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv320\n10.1056/NEJM198807143190204\n10.1056/NEJM200001203420301\n10.1056/NEJMoa042739\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685073\n10.1053/pcad.2000.7010\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.08.002\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318202e2ea\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089477\n10.1177/000331976001100505\n10.1016/j.vph.2005.06.003"}

In this work, we fabricated precisely controlled and biomimetic engineered model tissues to study how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions influence myocardial cell survival upon exposure to pathological level oxidative stress. Specifically, the interactions of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs), and the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), with its novel alternative regulator, HIF-1\u03b1 antisense RNA1 (HIF1A-AS1), in these interactions were investigated. We encapsulated CMs in photo-crosslinkable, biomimetic hydrogels with or without ECs, then exposed to oxidative stress followed by normoxia. With precisely controlled microenvironment provided by the model tissues, cell-cell interactions were restricted to be solely through the secreted factors. CM survival after oxidative stress was significantly improved, in the presence of ECs, when cells were in the model tissues that were functionalized with cell attachment motifs. Importantly, the cardioprotective effect of ECs was reduced when HIF-1\u03b1 expression was knocked down suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in cardioprotection from oxidative damage, provided through secreted factors conferred by the ECs. Using model tissues, we showed that cell survival increased with increased cell-cell communication and enhanced cell-matrix interactions. In addition, whole genome transcriptome analysis showed, for the first time to our knowledge, a possible role for HIF1A-AS1 in oxidative regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. We showed that although HIF1A-AS1 knockdown helps CM survival, its effect is overridden by CM-EC bidirectional interactions as we showed that the conditioned media taken from the CM-EC co-cultures improved CM survival, regardless of HIF1A-AS1 expression.\nCardiovascular diseases, most of which are associated with oxidative stress, is the most common cause of death worldwide. Thus, understanding the molecular events as well as the role of intercellular communication under oxidative stress is upmost importance in its prevention. In this study we used 3D engineered tissue models to investigate the role of HIF-1\u03b1 and its regulation in EC-mediated cardioprotection. We showed that EC-mediated protection is only possible when there is a bidirectional crosstalk between ECs and CMs even without physical cell-cell contact. In addition, this protective effect is at least partially related to cell-ECM interactions and HIF-1\u03b1, which is regulated by HIF1A-AS1 under oxidative stress.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-06-21", "authors": ["AylinAcun", "PinarZorlutuna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.023"}

A mouse model of AMI was established by ligation of the left ventricular dysfunction (LAD) coronary artery. Mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 12 per group): sham group, model group, CH groups treated with three doses of CH (100, 200, and 400mg/kg, intragastric), and a positive control group (captopril, 16.67mg/kg, intragastric). Heart function was evaluated by measurement of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) by echocardiography. Serum levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), plasma levels of angiotensin II (AngII), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\u00df (IL-1\u00df) and expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in the cardiac tissue homogenate, protein expressions of signal-transduction proteins, p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, JAK2, and STAT3 in heart tissues were measured by ELISA and Western blot analyses.

{"title": "The Erythropoietin System Protects the Heart Upon Injury by Cardiac Progenitor Cell Activation.", "abstract": "Erythropoietin (EPO) is a growth hormone, widely known for its role in erythropoiesis. The broad expression of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in adult organs suggested that EPO may also affect other cells besides late erythroid progenitors. In the embryonic heart, EPOR is expressed in all cells including the immature proliferating cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the embryonic heart in adulthood, EPOR expression is decreased and mainly detected in immature proliferating cells (i.e., resident cardiac progenitor cells) rather than in terminally differentiated cells (i.e., cardiomyocytes). Since cardiac progenitor cells are considered a regenerative cell source upon cardiac injury, the protective action of the EPO system was tested by creating an erythroid-rescued EPOR knockout mouse model. Although these mice appear to have less immature proliferating myocytes during embryogenesis, they reach adulthood without apparent morphological defects. However, upon ischemia reperfusion, these animals show a greater infarct size, suggesting that the EPO/EPOR protects the heart upon injury. Indeed preclinical studies showed that EPO administration postinfarction improves cardiac function via neoangiogenesis, antiapoptotic mechanisms, and/or CPC activation. Despite the promising preclinical data, large cohort clinical studies in humans failed to show a significant amelioration in cardiac function upon systemic injection of EPO in patients with myocardial infarctions. The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical trials may be due to differences between the doses, the way of delivery, the homogeneity of the cohorts, and last but not least the species differences. These data pinpoint the importance of carrying out preclinical studies in human models of disease as engineered human cardiac tissue that will provide a better understanding of the expression pattern of EPOR and the role of its ligand in human cardiac cells. Such studies may be able to bridge the gap between preclinical rodent data and human clinical trials and thus lead to the design of more successful clinical studies.", "journal": "Vitamins and hormones", "date": "2017-06-21", "authors": ["Maria PZafeiriou"], "doi": "10.1016/bs.vh.2017.04.001"}

The current clinical standard provides electroanatomic 3-D maps to visualize the electrical activation and locate the arrhythmogenic sources. However, the procedure is time-consuming and invasive. Electromechanical wave imaging is an ultrasound-based noninvasive technique that can provide 2-D maps of the electromechanical activation of the heart. In order to fully visualize the complex 3-D pattern of activation, several 2-D views are acquired and processed separately. They are then manually registered with a 3-D rendering software to generate a pseudo-3-D map. However, this last step is operator-dependent and time-consuming.\nThis paper presents a method to generate a full 3-D map of the electromechanical activation using multiple 2-D images. Two canine models were considered to illustrate the method: one in normal sinus rhythm and one paced from the lateral region of the heart. Four standard echographic views of each canine heart were acquired. Electromechanical wave imaging was applied to generate four 2-D activation maps of the left ventricle. The radial positions and activation timings of the walls were automatically extracted from those maps. In each slice, from apex to base, these values were interpolated around the circumference to generate a full 3-D map.\nIn both cases, a 3-D activation map and a cine-loop of the propagation of the electromechanical wave were automatically generated. The 3-D map showing the electromechanical activation timings overlaid on realistic anatomy assists with the visualization of the sources of earlier activation (which are potential arrhythmogenic sources). The earliest sources of activation corresponded to the expected ones: septum for the normal rhythm and lateral for the pacing case.\nThe proposed technique provides, automatically, a 3-D electromechanical activation map with a realistic anatomy.

By functional annotation of these DEGs and DEPs, genes that were enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway (NPPA, ERK2, ENO3, and EGLN3), VEGF signaling pathway (ERK2, A2M, FGF1, CTGF, and DPP4), and hypoxia-related processes (CRYAB, EGLN3, TGFB2, DPP4, and ACE) were identified as important candidate genes for high-altitude adaptation in the Tibetan pig.

Here we propose a scaffold that mimics aspects of cardiac extracellular matrix while preserving the contractility of cardiomyocytes. The scaffold is based on a poly(caprolactone) (PCL) nanofilm with magnetic properties (MNF, standing for magnetic nanofilm) coated with a layer of piezoelectric (PIEZO) microfibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (MNF+PIEZO). The nanofilm creates a flexible support for cell contraction and the aligned PIEZO microfibers deposited on top of the nanofilm creates conditions for cell alignment and electrical stimulation of the seeded cells. Our results indicate that MNF+PIEZO scaffold promotes rat and human cardiac cell attachment and alignment, maintains the ratio of cell populations overtime, promotes cell-cell communication and metabolic maturation, and preserves cardiomyocyte (CM) contractility for at least 12 days.

{"title": "Feline Panleukopenia Virus Is Not Associated With Myocarditis or Endomyocardial Restrictive Cardiomyopathy in Cats.", "abstract": "Canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) is nearly indistinguishable from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and is a well-known cause of viral myocarditis in young puppies; however, it is not known whether either FPV or CPV-2 naturally infects feline cardiomyocytes and causes myocarditis. Endomyocarditis (EMC) and left ventricular endomyocardial fibrosis (LVEF), clinically known as \"endomyocardial restrictive cardiomyopathy,\" are important feline heart diseases suspected to have an infectious etiology. A continuum is suggested with EMC representing the acute reaction to an unknown infectious agent and LVEF the chronic manifestation of repair. The purpose of this study was to determine (1) whether there is natural parvovirus infection of the feline myocardium and (2) whether parvoviral infection is associated with feline EMC and/or LVEF. In a retrospective study, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for the parvovirus VP1/2 gene was performed on archived heart tissue from cats with endomyocardial disease and controls. Similar methods were used prospectively on myocardial tissues from shelter-source kittens. Although 8 of 36 (22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-40%) shelter kittens had parvoviral DNA in myocardial tissue, VP1/2 DNA was not detected in 33 adult cases or 34 controls (95% CI, 0% to \u223c11%). These findings were confirmed by in situ hybridization: adult cats did not have detectable parvovirus DNA, although rare intranuclear signal was confirmed in 7 of 8 shelter-source kittens. In kittens, parvovirus was not significantly associated with myocarditis, and in situ hybridization signal did not colocalize with inflammation. Although infection of cardiomyocytes was demonstrated in kittens, these data do not support a role for parvovirus in EMC-LVEF.", "journal": "Veterinary pathology", "date": "2017-06-18", "authors": ["LauraMcEndaffer", "AlexMolesan", "HollisErb", "KathleenKelly"], "doi": "10.1177/0300985817695516"}
{"title": "Left ventricle Hermite-based segmentation.", "abstract": "In recent years, computed tomography (CT) has become a standard technique in cardiac imaging because it provides detailed information that may facilitate the diagnosis of the conditions that interfere with correct heart function. However, CT-based cardiac diagnosis requires manual segmentation of heart cavities, which is a difficult and time-consuming task. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel technique to segment endocardium and epicardium boundaries based on a 2D approach. The proposal computes relevant information of the left ventricle and its adjacent structures using the Hermite transform. The novelty of the work is that the information is combined with active shape models and level sets to improve the segmentation. Our database consists of mid-third slices selected from 28\u00a0volumes manually segmented by expert physicians. The segmentation is assessed using Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. In addition, we introduce a novel metric called Ray Feature error to evaluate our method. The results show that the proposal accurately discriminates cardiac tissue.

In mice, Streptococcus pneumoniae can invade the myocardium, induce cardiomyocyte death, and disrupt cardiac function following bacteremia, but it is unknown whether the same occurs in humans with severe pneumonia.\nWe sought to determine whether S. pneumoniae can (1) translocate the heart, (2) induce cardiomyocyte death, (3) cause MACE, and (4) induce cardiac scar formation after antibiotic treatment during severe pneumonia using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model.\nWe examined cardiac tissue from six adult NHPs with severe pneumococcal pneumonia and three uninfected control animals.

{"title": "Mono-Heteromeric Configurations of Gap Junction Channels Formed by Connexin43 and Connexin45 Reduce Unitary Conductance and Determine both Voltage Gating and Metabolic Flux Asymmetry.", "abstract": "In cardiac tissues, the expression of multiple connexins (Cx40, Cx43, Cx45, and Cx30.2) is a requirement for proper development and function. Gap junctions formed by these connexins have distinct permeability and gating mechanisms. Since a single cell can express more than one connexin isoform, the formation of hetero-multimeric gap junction channels provides a tissue with an enormous repertoire of combinations to modulate intercellular communication. To study further the perm-selectivity and gating properties of channels containing Cx43 and Cx45, we studied two monoheteromeric combinations in which a HeLa cell co-transfected with Cx43 and Cx45 was paired with a cell expressing only one of these connexins. Macroscopic measurements of total conductance between cell pairs indicated a drastic reduction in total conductance for mono-heteromeric channels. In terms of Vj dependent gating, Cx43 homomeric connexons facing heteromeric connexons only responded weakly to voltage negativity. Cx45 homomeric connexons exhibited no change in Vj gating when facing heteromeric connexons. The distributions of unitary conductances (\u03b3j) for both mono-heteromeric channels were smaller than predicted, and both showed low permeability to the fluorescent dyes Lucifer yellow and Rhodamine123. For both mono-heteromeric channels, we observed flux asymmetry regardless of dye charge: flux was higher in the direction of the heteromeric connexon for MhetCx45 and in the direction of the homomeric Cx43 connexon for MhetCx43. Thus, our data suggest that co-expression of Cx45 and Cx43 induces the formation of heteromeric connexons with greatly reduced permeability and unitary conductance. Furthermore, it increases the asymmetry for voltage gating for opposing connexons, and it favors asymmetric flux of molecules across the junction that depends primarily on the size (not the charge) of the crossing molecules.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2017-06-15", "authors": ["GuoqiangZhong", "NazemAkoum", "Daniel AAppadurai", "VolodyaHayrapetyan", "OsmanAhmed", "Agustin DMartinez", "Eric CBeyer", "Alonso PMoreno"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2017.00346\n10.1093/cvr/cvr351\n10.3109/15419060109080723\n10.1073/pnas.032062099\n10.1073/pnas.0603372103\n10.1177/002215549904700708\n10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1999)24:1/2<82::AID-DVG9>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1152/ajpcell.00484.2001\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75796-7\n10.1083/jcb.129.3.805\n10.1038/jid.2015.20\n10.1002/bies.950180907\n10.1152/ajpcell.00316.2010\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.025\n10.1161/01.RES.0000019580.64013.31\n10.1080/15419060390263092\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.08.040\n10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81775-7\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75960-7\n10.1152/ajpheart.00234.2007\n10.1016/0079-6107(86)90010-6\n10.1126/science.8093125\n10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81804-0\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00023-1\n10.1091/mbc.E12-02-0128\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.961227\n10.1085/jgp.201511375\n10.1161/01.RES.0000025638.24255.AA\n10.1091/mbc.6.4.459"}

Despite increased knowledge of the metabolic alterations that occur in heart failure, novel therapies to treat the observed metabolic disturbances are still lacking.\nMice were subjected to pressure overload by means of angiotensin-II infusion or transversal aortic constriction. MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes.

Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST-the E2 subcomponent of the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative metabolism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative metabolism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice.

The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by immune cells and the inability of the anti-oxidant system to neutralize ROS cause oxidative stress that further aggravates inflammation.

{"title": "Angiogenic peptide nanofibers repair cardiac tissue defect after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction remains one of the top leading causes of death in the world and the damage sustained in the heart eventually develops into heart failure. Limited conventional treatment options due to the inability of the myocardium to regenerate after injury and shortage of organ donors require the development of alternative therapies to repair the damaged myocardium. Current efforts in repairing damage after myocardial infarction concentrates on using biologically derived molecules such as growth factors or stem cells, which carry risks of serious side effects including the formation of teratomas. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetic peptide nanofiber scaffolds induce neovascularization in cardiovascular tissue after myocardial infarction, without the addition of any biologically derived factors or stem cells. When the GAG mimetic nanofiber gels were injected in the infarct site of rodent myocardial infarct model, increased VEGF-A expression and recruitment of vascular cells was observed. This was accompanied with significant degree of neovascularization and better cardiac performance when compared to the control saline group. The results demonstrate the potential of future clinical applications of these bioactive peptide nanofibers as a promising strategy for cardiovascular repair.\nWe present a synthetic bioactive peptide nanofiber system can enhance cardiac function and enhance cardiovascular regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) without the addition of growth factors, stem cells or other biologically derived molecules. Current state of the art in cardiac repair after MI utilize at least one of the above mentioned biologically derived molecules, thus our approach is ground-breaking for cardiovascular therapy after MI. In this work, we showed that synthetic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetic peptide nanofiber scaffolds induce neovascularization and cardiomyocyte differentiation for the regeneration of cardiovascular tissue after myocardial infarction in a rat infarct model. When the peptide nanofiber gels were injected in infarct site at rodent myocardial infarct model, recruitment of vascular cells was observed, neovascularization was significantly induced and cardiac performance was improved.

Avian migration is an energetically challenging physical stress, which represents a physiological model of muscular endurance exercises. This study assesses change in galectin gene expression profiles associated with seasonal variation in migratory state and endurance flight in yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata). Bioinformatics analysis and real-time qPCR were used to analyse the expression of galectins in flight muscle, heart and liver tissues of 15 warblers separated into three groups of winter unflown, and fall migratory flown/unflown birds. Five transcripts similar to chicken and human galectins -1, -2, -3, -4, and -8 were identified in warbler tissues. The expression of these galectins showed no seasonal changes between two experimental groups of birds maintained under unflown winter and fall conditions indicating a minor role of galectins in preparation for migration. However, endurance flight led to a significant elevation of galectin-1 and galectin-3 mRNAs in flight muscles and galectin-3 mRNA in heart tissue while no changes were observed in liver. Different changes were observed for the level of O-GlcNAcylated proteins, which were elevated in flight muscles under winter conditions. These results suggest that secreted galectin-1 and galectin-3 may be active in repair of bird muscles during and following migratory flight and serve as molecular biomarkers of recent arrival from migratory flights in field studies.", "journal": "Glycoconjugate journal", "date": "2017-06-10", "authors": ["Stefanie SBradley", "Morag FDick", "Christopher GGuglielmo", "Alexander VTimoshenko"], "doi": "10.1007/s10719-017-9779-2"}

This study is to investigate the effects of vitamin D on the pathological changes in rats with DCM.\nRats were randomly divided into the control, model, and treatment groups. DCM model was established by the high-fat and -sugar diet. Plasma glucose, body weight, heart weight, heart weight index, and serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were determined. Heart tissue morphology was detected with histochemical staining.

The impairment of both the Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) cell signaling system and the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) to the cell nucleus are associated with detrimental cardiovascular effects and inflammation. The effects of SERMs on these parameters in the cardiac tissue of estrogen-deficient rats has not been reported.\nWe investigated the effects of raloxifene and tamoxifen on ANP signaling, p65 NF-kB nuclear translocation, cardiac histology and contractility. Female rats were divided into five groups: control (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX-treated 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E), OVX-treated raloxifene (RLX) and OVX-treated tamoxifen (TAM). The treatments started 21days after ovariectomy and continued for 14days.\nOvariectomy reduced ANP mRNA in the left atrium (LA), decreased the content of ANP protein in the LA and in plasma, and increased the level of p65 NF-kB nuclear translocation in the left ventricle. Both 17-\u03b2-estradiol and SERMs were able to reverse these alterations, which were induced by the estrogen deficient state. The hemodynamic and cardiac structural parameters analyzed in the present work were not modified by the interventions.\nOur study demonstrates, for the first time, the additional benefits of raloxifene and tamoxifen in an estrogen-deficient state. These include the normalization of plasmatic and cardiac ANP levels and cardiac p65 NF-kB translocation.

{"title": "A gold nanoparticle coated porcine cholecyst-derived bioscaffold for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrices of xenogeneic origin have been extensively used for biomedical applications, despite the possibility of heterogeneity in structure. Surface modification of biologically derived biomaterials using nanoparticles is an emerging strategy for improving topographical homogeneity when employing these scaffolds for sophisticated tissue engineering applications. Recently, as a tissue engineering scaffold, cholecyst derived extracellular matrix (C-ECM) has been shown to have several advantages over extracellular matrices derived from other organs such as jejunum and urinary bladder. This study explored the possibility of adding gold nanoparticles, which have a large surface area to volume ratio on C-ECM for achieving homogeneity in surface architecture, a requirement for cardiac tissue engineering. In the current study, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized and functionalised for conjugating with a porcine cholecystic extracellular matrix scaffold. The conjugation of nanoparticles to C-ECM was achieved by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry and further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The physical properties of the modified scaffold were similar to the original C-ECM. Biological properties were evaluated by using H9c2 cells, a cardiomyoblast cell line commonly used for cellular and molecular studies of cardiac cells. The modified scaffold was found to be a suitable substrate for the growth and proliferation of the cardiomyoblasts.

{"title": "Effects of miR-29a and miR-101a Expression on Myocardial Interstitial Collagen Generation After Aerobic Exercise in Myocardial-infarcted Rats.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is accompanied by increased collagen deposition, cell necrosis and angiogenesis in cardiac tissue, which results in reduced ventricular compliance. Both microRNA-29a (miR-29a) and microRNA-101a (miR-101a) target the mRNAs encoding collagens and other proteins involved in fibrosis.\nWe assessed the effects of intermittent aerobic exercise on the expression of cardiac miR-29a and miR-101a and following effects on the TGF\u03b2, fos, Smad2/3, COL1A1 and COL3A1 in MI model of rats. Intermittent aerobic exercise for MI rats was begun from the second week and ended at the ninth week postsurgery. Expressions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and fibrosis-associated genes were detected from the infarction adjacent region located in the left ventricle. The heart coefficient (HC\u00a0=\u00a0heart weight/body weight) and hemodynamics assay were used to evaluate cardiac function level.\nIntermittent aerobic exercise inhibited myocardial interstitial collagen deposition and significantly improved cardiac function of MI rats. The results of real-time PCR and Western blot indicate that intermittent aerobic exercise enhanced the expression of miR-29a and miR-101a and inhibited TGF\u03b2 pathway in the MI rats.\nOur results suggest that controlled intermittent aerobic exercise can inhibit TGF\u03b2 pathway via up-regulation to the expression of miR-29a and miR-101a and finally cause a reduced fibrosis and scar formation in cardiac tissue. We believe that controlled intermittent aerobic exercise is beneficial to the healing and discovery of damaged cardiac tissues and their function after MI.", "journal": "Archives of medical research", "date": "2017-06-05", "authors": ["LiXiao", "HuiminHe", "LeleMa", "MiaomiaoDa", "SinanCheng", "YanDuan", "QianWang", "HuayiWu", "XiguiSong", "WeiDuan", "ZhenjunTian", "YingchunHou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.arcmed.2017.01.006"}
{"title": "Mdivi-1 induced acute changes in the angiogenic profile after ischemia-reperfusion injury in female mice.", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine the effects of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1), the mitochondrial fission inhibitor, on the angiogenic profiles after the ischemia reperfusion injury (IR injury) in female mice. Female mice were treated with Mdivi-1 inhibitor, 2\u00a0days prior, on the day of IR injury and 2\u00a0days after IR injury, for a period of 5\u00a0days. Both control and treatment groups underwent 30\u00a0min of ischemia and 72\u00a0h of reperfusion. On the day 3, mice were sacrificed and the ischemic and nonischemic portions of heart tissue were collected. Relative levels of 53 angiogenesis-related proteins were quantified simultaneously using Angiogenic arrays. Heart function was evaluated before and after 72\u00a0h of IR injury. Mdivi-1 treatment ameliorated IR induced functional deterioration with positive angiogenic profile. The seminal changes include suppression of Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP3), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP1) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) levels and prevention of connexin 43 (Cx43) loss and downregulation in the antioxidant enzyme levels. These changes are correlated with enhanced endothelial progenitor cell marker (cluster of differentiation (CD31), endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (Tek), fMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt4) and kinase insert domain protein receptor (Kdr)) presence. Our study is the first to report the role of mitochondrial dynamics in regulation of myocardial IR-induced angiogenic responses. Inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission after IR injury ameliorated heart dysfunction and conferred positive angiogenic response. In addition, there were improvements in the preservation of Cx43 levels and oxidative stress handling along with suppression of apoptosis activation. The findings will aid in shaping the rational drug development process for the prevention of ischemic heart disease, especially in females.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2017-06-04", "authors": ["SudhakarVeeranki", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.13298"}

{"title": "Biomarkers of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Lineages.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a practical source for the de novo generation of cardiac tissues and a unique opportunity to investigate cardiovascular lineage commitment. Numerous strategies have focused on the in vitro production of cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelium from hPSCs. However, these differentiation protocols often yield undesired cell types. Thus, establishing a set of stage-specific markers for pure cardiac subpopulations will assist in defining the hierarchy of cardiac differentiation, aid in the development of cellular therapy, and facilitate drug screening and disease modeling. The recent characterization of many such markers is enabling the isolation of major cardiac lineages and subpopulations from differentiating hPSCs.

{"title": "[Aging of the myocardium and dilated cardiomyopathy: morphological and molecular aspects].", "abstract": "The review considers various aspects of myocardium aging in normal and dilated cardiomyopathy (DC). There is a partial fibrosis of the heart tissue due to accumulation of collagen type 1, and accumulation of amyloid during normal aging. Men myocardial aging is accompanied by loss of cardiomyocytes and increased volume of the remaining cells, whereas in women this effect is absent. There is an expression of nuclear proteins decrease (lamin A and C), the accumulation of lipofuscin, increased content of reactive oxygen species, reduction of protein synthesis Sirt1 in cardiomyocytes with aging. Sirt1 has a cardioprotective effect, supports the balance of lipid metabolism, inhibits the development of inflammation and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Reduction of its expression not only indicates the accelerated pace of myocardial aging, but can be a predictor of the development of DC. In DC occurs stretching of the heart cavities and systolic dysfunction, predominantly in the left ventricle. DC is characterized by the development of inflammation in the myocardium. Its markers is increased expression of ICAM-1 adhesion molecule, MMP-2, MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1 tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and decreased expression of MMP-1 matrix

In combination with modern gene editing techniques like CRISPR/CAS, a new set of powerful tools becomes available for life science. Scientific fields like genotype and cell type-specific pharmacology, disease modeling, stem cell biology, and developmental biology have been dramatically fostered and their faces have been changed. However, as golden as the age of iPSC-derived cells and their manipulation has started, the shine begins to tarnish. Researchers face more and more practical problems intrinsic to the system. These problems are related to the specific culturing conditions which are not yet sufficient to mimic the natural environment of native stem cells differentiating towards adult cells. However, researchers work hard to uncover these factors. Here, we review a common standard approach to generate iPSCs and transduce these to iPSC cardiomyocytes. Further, we review recent achievements and discuss their current limitations and future perspectives.

{"title": "Expression of integrin-linked kinase improves cardiac function in a swine model of myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Previous studies have described the beneficial effects of overexpressing integrin-linked kinase (ILK) after myocardial infarction (MI) in small animal models. However, the effects of ILK in pre-clinical large animals are not known. To move closer to clinical translation, we examined the effects of ILK gene transfer in a swine model of ischemic heart disease. Swine received percutaneous intracoronary injections of adenoviral vector expressing ILK (n=10) or empty ad-null (n=10) in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) following LAD occlusion. Four weeks after transfection, we confirmed that transgene expression was restricted to the infarcted area in the cardiac tissue. Imaging studies demonstrated preserved cardiac function in the ILK group. ILK treatment was associated with reduced infarcted scar size and preserved left ventricular (LV) geometry (LV diameter and LV wall thickness).

Biochemical analyses during the acute phase showed increased ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the vitamin C and C/E groups. In the chronic phase, a decrease in GSH levels was observed in the vitamin E group and a decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was observed in the vitamin C/E group. Moreover, there was a decrease in TBARS in the cardiac tissues of the vitamin C and C/E groups compared to that of the placebo group, although this level was greater in the vitamin E group than in the vitamin C group.\nThe antioxidant action of vitamins C and E reduced oxidative stress in both the acute and chronic phases of Chagas disease, with a marked effect from joint administration, indicating their inherent synergism.", "journal": "Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical", "date": "2017-06-01", "authors": ["Thais de MelloTieghi", "Camilla ChimeloManca", "L\u00edgia Cangussu TomazGarcia", "Roberto Esteves PiresCastanho", "Altino Luiz SilvaTherezo", "FernandoFrei", "Elane de F\u00e1timaTaipeiro", "Luciam\u00e1re Perinetti AlvesMartins"], "doi": "10.1590/0037-8682-0451-2016"}
{"title": "Effects of astaxanthin in mice acutely infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.", "abstract": "During Trypanosoma cruzi infection, oxidative stress is considered a contributing factor for dilated cardiomyopathy development. In this study, the effects of astaxanthin (ASTX) were evaluated as an alternative drug treatment for Chagas disease in a mouse model during the acute infection phase, given its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and anti-oxidative properties. ASTX was tested in vitro in parasites grown axenically and in co-culture with Vero cells. In vivo tests were performed in BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old) infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and supplemented with ASTX (10 mg/kg/day) and/or nifurtimox (NFMX; 100 mg/kg/day). Results show that ASTX has some detrimental effects on axenically cultured parasites, but not when cultured with mammalian cell monolayers. In vivo, ASTX did not have any therapeutic value against acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection, used either alone or in combination with NFMX. Infected animals treated with NFMX or ASTX/NFMX survived the experimental period (60 days), while infected animals treated only with ASTX died before day 30 post-infection. ASTX did not show any effect on the control of parasitemia; however, it was associated with an increment in focal heart lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, a reduced number of amastigote nests in cardiac tissue, and less hyperplasic spleen follicles when compared to control groups. Unexpectedly, ASTX showed a negative effect in infected animals co-treated with NFMX. An increment in parasitemia duration was observed, possibly due to ASTX blocking of free radicals, an anti-parasitic mechanism of NFMX. In conclusion, astaxanthin is not recommended during the acute phase of Chagas disease, either alone or in combination with nifurtimox.\nPendant l\u2019infection par ", "journal": "Parasite (Paris, France)", "date": "2017-06-01", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda EloyContreras-Ortiz", "AlbertoBarbabosa-Pliego", "RigobertoOros-Pantoja", "Jos\u00e9 EstebanAparicio-Burgos", "Jos\u00e9 AntonioZepeda-Escobar", "Wael HegazyHassan-Moustafa", "LaucelOchoa-Garc\u00eda", "Mar\u00edaUx\u00faa Alonso-Fresan", "EsvietaTenorio Borroto", "Juan CarlosV\u00e1zquez-Chagoy\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1051/parasite/2017018"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac tissue of rats under different experimental conditions using modern second-order stereology and Voronoi tessellation techniques to show the spatial arrangement of the cardiomyocytes and microvessels. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups (n=6). The control group received PBS and the doxorubicin (DOX) group received 4mg/kg DOX on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. On the 24th day, the left ventricle was sectioned and prepared according to the \"orientator\" method for microscopically evaluations. The \"covariance functions\" were plotted using \"linear dipole probes\". Polygonal tessellation of the ventricles was also diagrammed using ImageJ software. The plotting the covariance curves of the cardiomyocytes and microvessels forming the \"gaps\" by slopped down, crossing the reference line and rose again. In the control group, the gaps were placed at 35-40\u03bcm and 14-16\u03bcm for the cardiomyocytes and microvessels, respectively. In the cardiotoxic group, the curves demonstrated larger gaps in comparison with the normal hearts, indicating repulsion of these structures. The curves of the cross-correlation function of the cardiomyocytes-microvessels also demonstrated the cardiomyocytes and microvessels were not normally correlated after the toxicity. Evaluation of Voronoi tessellations for the cardiomyocytes nuclei and microvessels in the normal and cardiotoxic groups showed that the areas of polygons in the normal heart were placed in the smaller range, while the areas fell in a larger range in the cases of cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "[Role of ceramide in reduction of the cardiolipin content in the heart during aging].", "abstract": "The close correlation between ceramide accumulation and cardiolipin content decrease in cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial dysfunction and heart failure was well documented. Taking into account that ceramide can alter the cardiolipin metabolism the purpose of the present study was to determine the role of ceramide in age-dependent decline of cardiolipin content in rat heart tissue. In the present work the puberty young, adult and old (3-, 12-, 24-, 30- and 34-month-old) Wistar male rats were used. It has been shown, that cardiolipin content significantly decreased, while content of cardiolipin precursor, phosphatidic acid, increased during aging. Doxorubicin injection to the rats or isolated heart perfusion with the C16-ceramide-conteined buffer induced ceramide accumulation and cardiolipin level drop in the heart of 3-month-old rats. Treatment of 24-month-old rats with inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase, melipramine and zoledronic acid, decreased the ceramide level and increased the cardiolipin content in the heart. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that the age-related ceramide accumulation is closely associated with the loss of cardiolipin content and may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart at old age. Acid sphingomyelinase and cardiolipin metabolism can be important targets for treatment of age-dependent heart pathology.\n\u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

{"title": "Connexin 43 is involved in the sympathetic atrial fibrillation in canine and canine atrial myocytes.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rapid cardiac arrhythmia associated with high morbidity and mortality. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve is involved in AF occurrence. The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) plays a key role in electrical conduction velocity in cardiac tissues, and under expression of Cx43 was linked with AF. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Cx43 was involved in sympathetic AF.\nFifteen dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups (5 in each group). Sympathetic AF was induced in dogs and isolated canine atrial myocytes by isoproterenol (ISO) perfusion and rapid atrium pacing (RAP). The expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the atrial tissues were detected using immunohistochemical staining. The transcription and protein expression of Cx43 in the AF cell model was measured. Subsequently, Cx43 was blocked by short interfering (si) RNA in atrial myocytes and the gap junctional intercellular communication was detected using the scrape-loading and dye transfer assay.\nSympathetic AF was successfully induced by a combination of ISO perfusion and RAP. The expression levels of NGF and TH were increased in the RAP group, and further increased in the RAP + ISO group. Tissue samples from the AF dogs had a lower Cx43 level than those of the control group (p<0.05). The expressions of mRNA and protein of Cx43 in sympathetic AF cell model decreased by 26% and 28%, respectively, when compared with the control group, with p<0.05. Silencing Cx43 in cells by siRNA could also efficiently reduce Cx43 expression. The relative levels of Cx45 mRNA were decreased by 73% compared with unaffected cells. The scrape-loading and dye transfer assay showed that gap junctional intercellular communication was hampered in the sympathetic AF cell model and silencing Cx43 could impede channel conduction.\nThe results suggested that low expression of Cx43 was involved in sympathetic AF by influencing intercellular channel conduction. Intervention of Cx43 expression might be an appealing therapy to sympathetic AF.", "journal": "Anatolian journal of cardiology", "date": "2017-05-31", "authors": ["ChenglinShu", "WeiqiangHuang", "ZhiyuZeng", "YanHe", "BeibeiLuo", "HaoLiu", "JinyiLi", "JianXu"], "doi": "10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2017.7602"}

{"title": "Assessment of aflatoxin B1 myocardial toxicity in rats: mitochondrial damage and cellular apoptosis in cardiomyocytes induced by aflatoxin B1.", "abstract": "Objective The number of deaths from heart disease is increasing worldwide. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a toxin produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, is frequently detected in improperly processed/stored human food products. While AFB1 hepatotoxicity and carcinogenic properties have been well addressed, its myocardial toxicity is poorly documented. This study aimed to investigate myocardial toxic activity of AFB1. Methods Ten rats were fed with AFB1 at a dose that did not result in acute toxic reactions for 30 days and 10 vehicle-fed rats served as controls. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick-end labelling assay was performed to detect apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Western blotting was performed to measure apoptotic proteins (i.e., active caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2) in heart tissue. Results AFB1 treatment resulted in mitochondrial membrane disruption and disorganization of cristae, which are indicators of mitochondrial damage. Myocardial cell apoptosis was significantly higher after AFB1 treatment (22.07%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.29%) compared with controls (6.27%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78%, P\u2009<\u20090.05).

This meticulous level of organization is imperative for assuring the normal and physiological pump-function of the heart. In the pathological cardiac tissue, the domains-related architecture is partially lost, resulting in morphological, electrical and metabolic remodeling and promoting cardiovascular diseases including heart failure and arrhythmias. Indeed, arrhythmogenesis during heart failure is a major clinical problem. Arrhythmias have been extensively studied from an electrical etiology, but only recently, physiologists and scientists have focused their attention on cellular and subcellular mechanosensors. We and others have investigated whether the nanoscale mechanosensitive properties of cardiomyocytes from failing hearts have a bearing upon the initiation of abnormal electrical activity.

{"title": "On the mechanisms of melatonin in protection of aluminum phosphide cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Aluminum phosphide (AlP), one of the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, has been the leading cause of self-poisoning mortalities among many Asian countries. The heart is the main organ affected in AlP poisoning. Melatonin has been previously shown to be beneficial in reversing toxic changes in the heart. The present study reveals evidence on the probable protective effects of melatonin on AlP-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The study groups included a control (almond oil only), ethanol 5% (solvent), sole melatonin (50\u00a0mg/kg), AlP (16.7\u00a0mg/kg), and 4 AlP\u00a0+\u00a0melatonin groups which received 20, 30, 40 and 50\u00a0mg/kg of melatonin by intraperitoneal injections following AlP treatment. An electronic cardiovascular monitoring device was used to record the electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters. Heart tissues were studied in terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, mitochondrial complexes activities, ADP/ATP ratio and apoptosis. Abnormal ECG records as well as declined heart rate and blood pressure were found to be related to AlP administration. Based on the results, melatonin was highly effective in controlling AlP-induced changes in the study groups. Significant improvements were observed in the activities of mitochondrial complexes, oxidative stress biomarkers, the activities of caspases 3 and 9, and ADP/ATP ratio following treatment with melatonin at doses of 40 and 50\u00a0mg/kg. Our results indicate that melatonin can counteract the AlP-induced oxidative damage in the heart. This is mainly done by maintaining the normal balance of intracellular ATP as well as the prevention of oxidative damage. Further research is warranted to evaluate the possibility of using melatonin as an antidote in AlP poisoning.", "journal": "Archives of toxicology", "date": "2017-05-30", "authors": ["Mohammad HosseinAsghari", "MiladMoloudizargari", "MaryamBaeeri", "AmirBaghaei", "MahbanRahimifard", "RezaSolgi", "AbbasJafari", "Hamed HaghiAminjan", "ShokoufehHassani", "Ali AkbarMoghadamnia", "Seyed NasserOstad", "MohammadAbdollahi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00204-017-1998-6"}

Valvular heart disease is a strong predictor, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of somatic variants in AF candidate genes in an AF patient population undergoing surgery for mitral valve regurgitation (MVR) to determine whether these patients are genetically predisposed to AF.\nDNA was extracted from blood and left atrial tissue from 44 AF patients with MVR. Using next-generation sequencing, we investigated 110 genes using the HaloPlex Target Enrichment System. MuTect software was used for identification of somatic point variants. We functionally characterized selected variants using electrophysiologic techniques.\nNo somatic variants were identified in the cardiac tissue. Thirty-three patients (75%) had a rare germline variation in \u22651\u00a0candidate genes. Fourteen variants were novel. Fifteen variants were predicted damaging or likely damaging in \u22656 in silico predictions. We identified rare variants in genes never directly associated with AF: KCNE4, SCN4B, NEURL1, and CAND2. Interestingly, 7 patients (16%) had variants in genes involved in cellular potassium handling. The variants KCNQ1 (p.G272S) and KCNH2 (p.A913V) resulted in gain of function due to faster activation (KCNQ1) and slowed deactivation kinetics (KCNQ1, KCNH2).\nWe did not find any somatic variants in patients with AF and MVR.

It has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. Although terpene glycoside (TG), the major component in CS, has been shown to possess cardioprotective properties, the mechanism underlying CS-TG's preventive effect against myocardial ischemia injury is unknown. This study was conducted to explore the protective and curative effects of CS-TG against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemic injury in rats and investigate the underlying myocardial protective mechanisms.\nA rat model of ISO-induced myocardial ischemia was established to evaluate the protective effect of CS-TG in ameliorating heart injury. Myocardial ischemia was induced by administering ISO (40mg/kg/d) subcutaneously for 2 days. Serum was collected and analyzed for the levels of different cardiac biomarkers, and heart tissues were isolated and prepared for ATP analysis, glycogen content determination, histopathology assay, and ultrastructure observation. The regulatory effects of CS-TG on myocardial apoptosis in rats were studied by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and the levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by western blotting. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were conducted to examine whether the CS-TG's cardioprotective effects were linked to the inhibition of apoptosis via activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway.\nCS-TG (300mg/kg/d) significantly decreased serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ISO-induced myocardial ischemic rats. Analysis of ATP and glycogen contents, myocardial ultrastructure, and pathological examination showed that CS-TG (300mg/kg/d) significantly improved energy metabolism and alleviated myocardial injury in vivo. In addition, the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR in rats subjected to CS-TG significantly elevated, while the levels of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 dramatically reduced. Moreover, treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, abrogated CS-TG (200\u03bcg/mL) induced down-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2 in the serum.\nCS-TG protects the heart from ISO-induced myocardial ischemia, potentially by improving cardiac energy metabolism and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

{"title": "Sema3A promotes the resolution of cardiac inflammation after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Optimal healing after myocardial infarction requires not only the induction of inflammation, but also its timely resolution. In patients, 30\u00a0days post myocardial infarction, circulating monocytes have increased expression of Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) as compared to directly after admission. This increased expression coincides with increased expression of Cx3CR1-a marker of non-classical monocytes that are important for immune resolution hence proper wound healing. In mice, the expression of Sema3A also increases in response to myocardial ischemia being expressed by infiltrating leukocytes. Comparing Sema3A heterozygote (HZ) and wild type (WT) mice post myocardial infarction, revealed increased presence of leukocytes in the cardiac tissues of HZ mice as compared to WT, with no differences in capillary density, collagen deposition, cardiomyocyte surface area, chemokine-or adhesion molecules expression. Whilst infarct sizes were similar 14\u00a0days after myocardial infarction in both genotypes, Sema3A HZ mice had thinner infarcts and reduced cardiac function as compared to their WT littermates. In vitro experiments were conducted to study the role of Sema3A in inflammation and resolution of inflammation as a potential explanation for the differences in leukocyte recruitment and cardiac function observed in our in vivo experiments. Here, recombinant Sema3A protein was able to affect the pro-inflammatory state of cultured bone marrow derived macrophages. First, the pro-inflammatory state was altered by the induced apoptosis of classical macrophages in the presence of Sema3A. Second, Sema3A promoted the polarization of classical macrophages to resolution-phase macrophages and enhanced their efferocytotic ability, findings that were reflected in the infarcted cardiac tissue of the Sema3A HZ mice. Finally, we demonstrated that besides promoting resolution of inflammation, Sema3A was also able to retard the migration of monocytes to the myocardium.

These experiments were performed with LE in either a recirculating (2%-16%) or washout (nonrecirculating) condition (0.05%-12%) for 60 minutes. The effect of LE itself (0.05%-12%) was examined. Oxfenicine was used to evaluate the metabolic action of LE to reverse asystole. BPV concentrations in solution and myocardial tissues were measured.\nIn the recirculation condition, partial recovery of contractile forces was observed for 60 minutes at 4%, 8%, and 12% LE. A contracture followed after exposure to 16% LE in some asystolic muscles. In the washout experiments, following asystole, LE (0.05%-12%) had no effect on the recovery time of the first and regular contractile responses. LE (0.1%-8%) restored contractility to baseline levels after 45 minutes; partial recovery was shown with lower (0.05%) and higher (12%) concentrations. Oxfenicine did not alter the recovery of contractile forces. Contractile depression was observed with 12% LE alone. Concentration-related reduction of tissue BPV concentration by LE was observed in both circulating conditions.\nLE induced time- and concentration-dependent recovery of stimulated myocardial contractions from BPV-induced asystole. The lipid uptake effect, along with other undefined mechanisms of LE, seems to contribute to the recovery of contractile function; however, the LE effect on myocardial metabolism is less likely involved at this concentration (500 \u03bcM) of BPV.", "journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "date": "2017-05-26", "authors": ["Wyun KonPark", "Hyun SooKim", "Soo HwanKim", "Ja RangJung", "CarlLynch", "Nar HyunMin"], "doi": "10.1213/ANE.0000000000002124"}
{"title": "Altered expression of ", "abstract": "A small number of cardiac stem cells that express the c-Kit and Nanog biomarkers can be differentiated into myocardial cells, which suggests that these stem cells may be able to repair damage and provide an internal reserve for tissue regeneration. It is unknown, however, whether the levels of myocardial stem cells are altered after heart failure (HF), and whether HF affects the myocardial regenerative ability. In this study, to address this question, we developed a rat model of chronic HF induced by Adriamycin, and examined the morphological changes in c-Kit and Nanog-expressing stem cells in heart tissue of normal and HF rats. We further measured levels of c-Kit and Nanog expression in the hearts of HF vs. healthy control rats using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR methods. c-Kit and Nanog were expressed in both normal and HF rats; c-Kit was mainly found in and around the epicardial region, whereas Nanog was primarily expressed in vascular endothelium of some myocardial cells and in stem cells. However, expression of both c-Kit and Nanog was significantly decreased in myocardial cells from HF rats, which may be reflective of reduced myocardial regeneration capacity. These findings indicate that HF not only seriously damages the heart muscle cells, but also the cardiac stem cells. This reduced pool of cardiac stem cells and their related factors is likely to be deleterious for tissue repair after myocardial injury.", "journal": "American journal of cardiovascular disease", "date": "2017-05-24", "authors": ["ShuoLi", "KangGuo", "JunfangWu", "ZhikunGuo", "AirongLi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Characterization of Cardiovascular Alterations Induced by Different Chronic Cisplatin Treatments.", "abstract": "In the last years, many clinical studies have revealed that some cisplatin-treated cancer survivors have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events, being cisplatin-induced cardiovascular toxicity an increasing concern. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the cardiovascular alterations induced by different chronic cisplatin treatments, and to identify some of the mechanisms involved. Direct blood pressure, basal cardiac (left ventricle and coronary arteries) and vascular (aortic and mesenteric) functions were evaluated in chronic (5 weeks) saline- or cisplatin-treated male Wistar rats. Three different doses of cisplatin were tested (1, 2, and 3 mg/kg/week). Alterations in cardiac and vascular tissues were also investigated by immunohistochemistry, Western Blot, and or quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Cisplatin treatment provoked a significant modification of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and basal cardiac function at the maximum dose tested. However, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurred at lower doses. The expression of collagen fibers and conexin-43 were increased in cardiac tissue in cisplatin-treated rats with doses of 2 and 3 mg/kg/week. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was also modified in cardiac and vascular tissues after cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, chronic cisplatin treatment provokes cardiac and vascular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs at lower doses than cardiac and systemic cardiovascular toxicity. Moreover, some structural changes in cardiac and vascular tissues are also patent even before any systemic cardiovascular alterations.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2017-05-24", "authors": ["EsperanzaHerrad\u00f3n", "CristinaGonz\u00e1lez", "Jos\u00e9 AUranga", "RaquelAbalo", "Ma IMart\u00edn", "VisitacionL\u00f3pez-Miranda"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2017.00196\n10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01677.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00102.2009\n10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.005\n10.1016/S0014-4886(03)00003-7\n10.1124/jpet.109.161158\n10.1007/BF02341156\n10.1111/j.1365-2982.2010.01483.x\n10.1016/j.lfs.2004.06.018\n10.1177/0960327110390064\n10.3109/01480545.2013.851688\n10.1093/annonc/mds293\n10.1007/s11517-008-0338-7\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.01.013\n10.1016/j.resp.2013.03.013\n10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2016.04.003\n10.1016/j.tox.2016.10.001\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.085\n10.1016/j.cbi.2013.11.008\n10.1097/01.ASN.0000132474.50966.DA\n10.1016/j.biochi.2011.02.015\n10.18632/oncotarget.12494\n10.1002/jcp.22783\n10.1002/dmrr.1176\n10.1002/mpo.10335\n10.1016/j.hoc.2008.01.003\n10.4137/CMC.S19704\n10.1016/j.urolonc.2014.11.012\n10.1016/j.taap.2005.06.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018347\n10.5582/ddt.2012.v6.3.147\n10.1111/j.1442-2042.2008.02066.x\n10.3892/Br.2014.349\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.027\n10.1053/ctrv.1999.0097\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210086\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2009.05323.x\n10.1016/j.pbb.2005.11.017\n10.1056/NEJM199001113220210\n10.1016/j.cbi.2004.10.004\n10.1152/ajpendo.00594.2004\n10.2165/00002018-200022040-00002\n10.1002/ejp.897\n10.1159/000098062\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.09.024\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.09.015\n10.1111/j.1365-2605.1987.tb00204.x\n10.1177/1078155214522314\n10.1159/000008197\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181cf91ac\n10.5551/jat.32300\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.08.061\n10.1210/en.2006-0914\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000200658.89629.ba\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63135-5\n10.1126/science.7361117\n10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7193\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01420.x\n10.1002/cncr.23389\n10.1016/j.pbb.2013.02.008\n10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01674.x\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.06.012\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199903)22:3<329::AID-MUS5>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1080/01926230490508821\n10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31812dfe1e\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00129.x"}

After crosslinking by the glutaraldehyde vapor, the structure, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and in-fiber chemical interactions of the scaffolds were investigated. We found that the fiber diameter decreased with the concentration of chitosan, while mechanical properties and hydrophilicity improved. In addition, we found that scaffolds with aligned fibers have higher mechanical strength and biocompatibility than scaffolds with randomly oriented fibers. In particular, scaffolds with aligned fibers with PLA:chitosan ratios of 7:1 was found to support cardiomyocyte viability, elicit cell elongation, and enhance production of sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and troponin I.

Although TH was traditionally thought to be produced exclusively by the thyroid gland, an increasing number of studies report TH production in other tissues. Based on these findings, we evaluated whether the genes required for TH biosynthesis are expressed in the human heart, and whether their expression is altered in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and is related to epigenetic variations.\nTwenty-three LV tissue samples were obtained from ICM patients (n=13) undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (n=10) for RNA sequencing analysis. We increased the LV samples to 27 for the ELISA determination of total T4 and T3 tissue levels. For epigenomic studies, 850K Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform was performed.\nUsing RNA-sequencing, we displayed the expression levels of all components required for TH biosynthesis in human heart tissue. We observed significantly altered expression of genes encoding thyroperoxidase (TPO; -2.48-fold, P<0.05) and dual oxidase 2 (2.83-fold, P<0.05), the main enzymatic system of TH production, and significant relationships between their altered expression and LV remodeling parameters. In addition, epigenetic analysis revealed a differential methylation pattern in TPO, and triiodothyronine tissue levels were significantly decreased (P<0.01).\nThese results showed that the human heart expresses the TH biosynthesis machinery, being altered its main enzymatic system in patients with ICM. Given the relevance of TH in cardiac pathology, our results provide a foundation for new therapeutic approaches based on TPO for treating ICM.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2017-05-21", "authors": ["CarolinaGil-Cayuela", "EstherRosell\u00f3-LLet\u00ed", "Estefan\u00edaTaraz\u00f3n", "AnaOrtega", "JuanSandoval", "LuisMart\u00ednez-Dolz", "JuanCinca", "EstherJorge", "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3nGonz\u00e1lez-Juanatey", "FranciscaLago", "MiguelRivera", "ManuelPortol\u00e9s"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.05.042"}

However, cells produced by existing protocols display a range of immaturity compared with native adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. Many efforts have been made to mature hPSC-CMs, with only moderate maturation attained thus far. Therefore, an engineered system, called biowire, has been devised by providing both physical and electrical cues to lead hPSC-CMs to a more mature state in vitro. The system uses a microfabricated platform to seed hPSC-CMs in collagen type I gel along a rigid template suture to assemble into aligned cardiac tissue (biowire), which is subjected to electrical field stimulation with a progressively increasing frequency. Compared to nonstimulated controls, stimulated biowired cardiomyocytes exhibit an enhanced degree of structural and electrophysiological maturation. Such changes are dependent upon the stimulation rate. This manuscript describes in detail the design and creation of biowires.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2017-05-19", "authors": ["XuetaoSun", "Sara SNunes"], "doi": "10.3791/55373"}

{"title": "In vivo and molecular docking studies using whole extract and phytocompounds of Aegle marmelos fruit protective effects against Isoproterenol-induced Myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading major health problem with increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present study investigates isoproterenol (ISO) induced MI and the beneficial role of Aegle marmelos fruit extract (AMFE) in rats. Our results indicated the significant augmentation of plasma nitric oxide (NOx) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, apolipoprotein B (apo-B), cardiac tissue lipid peroxidation and liver 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in ISO treated rats (85mg/kg b.wt) with a concomitant decrease in plasma apolipoprotein A1 (apo-A), lipase activity, paraoxonase-1 activity and cardiac tissue taurine levels when compared with controls. However, pretreatment of ISO administered rats with AMFE (150mg/kg b.wt/day for 45 days) markedly brought the observed alterations toward near normal level indicating its protective role against MI. Further, we have extended our studies to study the interaction of important phytocompounds, marmesin, marmin, umbelliferone and impertonin, present in AMFE with key enzymes, HMG-CoA reductase, iNOS, lipoprotein lipase and paraoxonase using AutoDock4.

{"title": "Electro-mechanical dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2D model of human atrial tissue.", "abstract": "We investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback and atrial fibrillation induced electrical remodelling (AFER) of cellular ion channel properties on the dynamics of spiral waves in a discrete 2D model of human atrial tissue. The tissue electro-mechanics are modelled using the discrete element method (DEM). Millions of bonded DEM particles form a network of coupled atrial cells representing 2D cardiac tissue, allowing simulations of the dynamic behaviour of electrical excitation waves and mechanical contraction in the tissue. In the tissue model, each cell is modelled by nine particles, accounting for the features of individual cellular geometry; and discrete inter-cellular spatial arrangement of cells is also considered. The electro-mechanical model of a human atrial single-cell was constructed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Colman et al. to the mechanical myofilament model of Rice et al., with parameters modified based on experimental data. A stretch-activated channel was incorporated into the model to simulate the mechano-electrical feedback. In order to investigate the effect of mechano-electrical feedback on the dynamics of spiral waves, simulations of spiral waves were conducted in both the electromechanical model and the electrical-only model in normal and AFER conditions, to allow direct comparison of the results between the models. Dynamics of spiral waves were characterized by tracing their tip trajectories, stability, excitation frequencies and meandering range of tip trajectories. It was shown that the developed DEM method provides a stable and efficient model of human atrial tissue with considerations of the intrinsically discrete and anisotropic properties of the atrial tissue, which are challenges to handle in traditional continuum mechanics models. This study provides mechanistic insights into the complex behaviours of spiral waves and the genesis of atrial fibrillation by showing an important role of the mechano-electrical feedback in facilitating and promoting atrial fibrillation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-05-17", "authors": ["PaulBrocklehurst", "HaiboNi", "HengguiZhang", "JianqiaoYe"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0176607\n10.1056/NEJMra000650\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303211\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.555\n10.1371/journal.pone.0142397\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00862.2009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059317\n10.1152/ajpheart.00923.2006\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.01.016\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.067306\n10.1016/S0002-8703(03)00086-3\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1113/jphysiol.2013.254987\n10.1529/biophysj.107.119487\n10.1007/s10974-005-9005-x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.11.024\n10.1161/CIRCEP.109.933036\n10.1007/s00424-002-0948-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.04.056\n10.1093/europace/euq280\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.005300\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.007\n10.1109/TBME.1978.326270\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.06.011\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1781\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305326"}

Combined with microfluidic technologies, a heart-on-a-chip is very likely to be developed and function as a platform for high throughput drug screening. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone elastomer is a widely-used biomaterial for the investigation of cell-substrate interactions and biochip fabrication. However, the intrinsic PDMS surface hydrophobicity inhibits cell adhesion on the PDMS surface, and PDMS surface modification is required for effective cell adhesion. Meanwhile, the formulation of PDMS also affects the behaviors of the cells. To fabricate PDMS-based biochips for ESC pluripotency maintenance and cardiac differentiation, PDMS surface modification and formulation were optimized in this study. We found that a polydopamine (PD) with gelatin coating greatly improved the ESC adhesion, proliferation and cardiac differentiation on its surface. In addition, different PDMS substrates varied in their surface properties, which had different impacts on ESCs, with the 40\u2009:\u20091 PDMS substrate being more favorable for ESC adhesion and proliferation as well as embryoid body (EB) attachment than the other PDMS substrates. Moreover, the ESC pluripotency was best maintained on the 5\u2009:\u20091 PDMS substrate, while the cardiac differentiation of the ESCs was optimal on the 40\u2009:\u20091 PDMS substrate. Based on the optimized coating method and PDMS formulation, biochips with two different designs were fabricated and evaluated. Compared to the single channels, the multiple channels on the biochips could provide larger areas and accommodate more nutrients to support improved ESC pluripotency maintenance and cardiac differentiation.

{"title": "Modelling far field pacing for terminating spiral waves pinned to ischaemic heterogeneities in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "In cardiac tissue, electrical spiral waves pinned to a heterogeneity can be unpinned (and eventually terminated) using electric far field pulses and recruiting the heterogeneity as a virtual electrode. While for isotropic media the process of unpinning is much better understood, the case of an anisotropic substrate with different conductivities in different directions still needs intensive investigation. To study the impact of anisotropy on the unpinning process, we present numerical simulations based on the bidomain formulation of the phase I of the Luo and Rudy action potential model modified due to the occurrence of acute myocardial ischaemia. Simulating a rotating spiral wave pinned to an ischaemic heterogeneity, we compare the success of sequences of far field pulses in the isotropic and the anisotropic case for spirals still in transient or in steady rotation states. Our results clearly indicate that the range of pacing parameters resulting in successful termination of pinned spiral waves is larger in anisotropic tissue than in an isotropic medium.This article is part of the themed issue 'Mathematical methods in medicine: neuroscience, cardiology and pathology'.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation roles in response to oxidative stress. However, the role of 12/15-LO in viral myocarditis (VMC) and its underlying molecular mechanism have not yet been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that 12/15-LO was up-regulated and Nrf2 was down-regulated in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-infected mice and cardiac myocytes. Baicalein, the specific inhibitor of 12/15-LO, was employed to investigate the role of 12/15-LO and its underlying mechanism in VMC. We found that baicalein treatment alleviated CVB3-induced VMC mouse models, as demonstrated by less inflammatory lesions in the heart tissues and less CK-MB level. Moreover, baicalein treatment attenuated CVB3-induced inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress. Mechanistic analysis suggested that baicalein treatment relieved CVB3-induced reduction of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions.

{"title": "Molecular Pathways Involved in the Amelioration of Myocardial Injury in Diabetic Rats by Kaempferol.", "abstract": "There is growing evidence that chronic hyperglycemia leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which exerts its effect via interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). AGE-RAGE activation results in oxidative stress and inflammation. It is well known that this mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Kaempferol, a dietary flavonoid, is known to possess antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, little is known about the effect of kaempferol on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats using streptozotocin (70 mg/kg; i.p.), and rats with glucose level >250 mg/dL were considered as diabetic. Diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (2 mL/kg; i.p.) and kaempferol (20 mg/kg; i.p.) daily for a period of 28 days and on the 28th day, ischemia was produced by one-stage ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min. After completion of surgery, rats were sacrificed and the heart tissue was processed for biochemical, morphological, and molecular studies. Kaempferol pretreatment significantly reduced hyperglycemia, maintained hemodynamic function, suppressed AGE-RAGE axis activation, normalized oxidative stress, and preserved morphological alterations. In addition, there was decreased level of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NF-\u03baB), inhibition of active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 proteins, and activation of Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) a prosurvival kinase. Furthermore, it also attenuated apoptosis by reducing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells, and increasing the level of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2).

{"title": "In vivo reprogramming for heart regeneration: A glance at efficiency, environmental impacts, challenges and future directions.", "abstract": "Replacing dying or diseased cells of a tissue with new ones that are converted from patient's own cells is an attractive strategy in regenerative medicine. In vivo reprogramming is a novel strategy that can circumvent the hurdles of autologous/allogeneic cell injection therapies. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that direct injection of cardiac transcription factors or specific miRNAs into the infarct border zone of murine hearts following myocardial infarction converts resident cardiac fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes. Moreover, in vivo cardiac reprogramming not only drives cardiac tissue regeneration, but also improves cardiac function and survival rate after myocardial infarction. Thanks to the influence of cardiac microenvironment and the same developmental origin, cardiac fibroblasts seem to be more amenable to reprogramming toward cardiomyocyte fate than other cell sources (e.g. skin fibroblasts). Thus, reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to functional induced cardiomyocytes in the cardiac environment holds great promises for induced regeneration and potential clinical purposes. Application of small molecules in future studies may represent a major advancement in this arena and pharmacological reprogramming would convey reprogramming technology to the translational medicine paradigm. This study reviews accomplishments in the field of in vitro and in vivo mouse cardiac reprogramming and then deals with strategies for the enhancement of the efficiency and quality of the process.

{"title": "Engineered 3D Cardiac Fibrotic Tissue to Study Fibrotic Remodeling.", "abstract": "Activation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is considered to play an essential role in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. A limiting factor in studying this process is the spontaneous activation of cardiac fibroblasts when cultured on two-dimensional (2D) culture plates. In this study, a simplified three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel platform of contractile cardiac tissue, stimulated by transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), is presented to recapitulate a fibrogenic microenvironment. It is hypothesized that the quiescent state of cardiac fibroblasts can be maintained by mimicking the mechanical stiffness of native heart tissue. To test this hypothesis, a 3D cell culture model consisting of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts encapsulated within a mechanically engineered gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, is developed. The study shows that cardiac fibroblasts maintain their quiescent phenotype in mechanically tuned hydrogels. Additionally, treatment with a beta-adrenergic agonist increases beating frequency, demonstrating physiologic-like behavior of the heart constructs. Subsequently, quiescent cardiac fibroblasts within the constructs are activated by the exogenous addition of TGF-\u03b21. The expression of fibrotic protein markers (and the functional changes in mechanical stiffness) in the fibrotic-like tissues are analyzed to validate the model. Overall, this 3D engineered culture model of contractile cardiac tissue enables controlled activation of cardiac fibroblasts, demonstrating the usability of this platform to study fibrotic remodeling.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2017-05-13", "authors": ["Amir HosseinSadeghi", "Su RyonShin", "Janine CDeddens", "GiuseppeFratta", "SerenaMandla", "Iman KYazdi", "GyanPrakash", "SilviaAntona", "DaniloDemarchi", "Marc PBuijsrogge", "Joost P GSluijter", "JesperHjortnaes", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201601434"}

Scaffold-free ECTs containing different ratios (25%, 50%, 70%, or 90%) of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were generated by magnetic-activated cell sorting by using cardiac-specific markers.

Furthermore, transplantation of ECTs containing 50% or 70% cardiomyocytes into a rat chronic myocardial infarction model led to a more profound functional recovery as compared with controls. Notably, transplanted ECTs showed electrical synchronization with the native heart under Langendorff perfusion.

Differential expression of 5 genes encoding different members of the mediator complex was disclosed in this analysis. Interestingly, a significant alteration was found for genes which had never been associated with HF until now, and 27 lncRNA/mRNA pairs that were significantly altered in HF patients.\nThe present findings revealed specific expression pattern of both protein-coding and lncRNAs in HF patients, confirming that new LV myocardial biomarkers could be reliably identified using Next-Generation Sequencing-based approaches.", "journal": "Cardiology journal", "date": "2017-05-13", "authors": ["ConcettaSchiano", "ValerioCosta", "MariannaAprile", "VincenzoGrimaldi", "CiroMaiello", "RobertaEsposito", "AndreaSoricelli", "VittorioColantuoni", "FrancescoDonatelli", "AlfredoCiccodicola", "ClaudioNapoli"], "doi": "10.5603/CJ.a2017.0052"}

How these subcellular/cellular events overcome source-sink factors in cardiac tissue to generate DADs of sufficient amplitude to trigger action potentials is not fully understood. Here, we evaluate quantitatively how factors at the subcellular scale (number of Ca wave initiation sites), cellular scale (sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca load), and tissue scale (synchrony of Ca release in populations of myocytes) determine DAD features in cardiac tissue using a combined experimental and computational modeling approach. Isolated patch-clamped rabbit ventricular myocytes loaded with Fluo-4 to image intracellular Ca were rapidly paced during exposure to elevated extracellular Ca (2.7\u00a0mmol/L) and isoproterenol (0.25 \u03bcmol/L) to induce diastolic Ca waves and subthreshold DADs. As the number of paced beats increased from 1 to 5, SR Ca content (assessed with caffeine pulses) increased, the number of Ca wave initiation sites increased, integrated Ca transients and DADs became larger and shorter in duration, and the latency period to the onset of Ca waves shortened with reduced variance. In silico analysis using a computer model of ventricular tissue incorporating these experimental measurements revealed that whereas all of these factors promoted larger DADs with higher probability of generating triggered activity, the latency period variance and SR Ca load had the greatest influences. Therefore, incorporating quantitative experimental data into tissue level simulations reveals that increased intracellular Ca promotes DAD-mediated triggered activity in tissue predominantly by increasing both the synchrony (decreasing latency variance) of Ca waves in nearby myocytes and SR Ca load, whereas the number of Ca wave initiation sites per myocyte is less important.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2017-05-13", "authors": ["Christopher YKo", "Michael BLiu", "ZhenSong", "ZhilinQu", "James NWeiss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2017.03.006"}

To evaluate the effect of astaxanthin on ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction, 18 aged Long Evans male rats were evenly divided into three groups. Group I (Control group) was given only the laboratory-ground food and normal water. Group II (ISO group) was administered ISO at a dose of 50 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for two weeks. Group III (Astaxanthin + ISO group) was treated with astaxanthin (25 mg/kg) orally every day and ISO 50 mg/kg SC twice a week for two weeks. ISO administration in rats increased the heart and left ventricular wet weights and increased inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Moreover, ISO administration increased the lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities in heart tissues. Astaxanthin treatment prevented the increased wet weight of heart and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. The protective effect of astaxanthin was associated with reduction of free radicals by improving antioxidant enzyme function, as well as normalization and/or suppression of elevated oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and advanced protein oxidation product (APOP) in ISO-administered rats. Furthermore, astaxanthin decreased the elevated activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and creatinin kinase muscle/brain (CK-MB) in ISO-administered rats. In conclusion, astaxanthin may protect cardiac tissues in ISO-administered rats through suppression of oxidative stress and enhancement of antioxidant enzyme functions.", "journal": "Journal of dietary supplements", "date": "2017-05-11", "authors": ["Mohammad NazmulAlam", "Md MuradHossain", "Md MizanurRahman", "NusratSubhan", "Md Abdullah AlMamun", "AnaytUlla", "Hasan MahmudReza", "Md AshrafulAlam"], "doi": "10.1080/19390211.2017.1321078"}
{"title": "NLRP4 is an essential negative regulator of fructose-induced cardiac injury in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "High fructose consumption leads to metabolic syndrome and enhances cardiovascular disease risk. However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying the cardiac disease caused by fructose feeding is still poor. Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are intracellular sensors, responding to a variety of intracellular danger signals to induce injuries. NLRP4 is a negative regulator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway through interactions with kinase I\u03baB kinase (IKK). Here, we illustrated that NLRP4 attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing, including Transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21), Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in fructose-treated cardiac cells by means of RT-qPCR, and western blotting analysis. In addition, NLRP4 could reduce the expression of TANK-binding kinase 1/interferon regulatory factor 3 (TBK1/IRF3), reducing inflammation response and achieving its anti-hypertrophic action. TBK1 plays critical roles in the IRF3 signaling pathway, modulating inflammation response. The inhibition of IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by NLRP4 is confirmed by NLRP4 over-expression and knockdown. In vivo, high fructose feeding induced cardiac injury, accompanied with reduced expression of NLRP4 in heart tissue samples, indicating the possible role of NLRP4 in ameliorating heart injury. In conclusion, the findings above indicated that NLRP4 is an important mediator of cardiac remodeling in vitro and in vivo through negatively regulating TBK1/IRF3 and IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, indicating that NLRP4 might be a promising therapeutic target against cardiac inflammation.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2017-05-10", "authors": ["Yong-GangLian", "Hai-YingZhao", "Sheng-JiWang", "Qin-LiangXu", "Xiang-JunXia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.04.120"}

{"title": "Hydrogen Sulfide Improves Cardiomyocyte Function in a Cardiac Arrest Model.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cardioplegic arrest is a common procedure for many types of cardiac surgery, and different formulations have been proposed to enhance its cardio-protective effect. Hydrogen sulfide is an important signaling molecule that has cardio-protective properties. We therefore studied the cardio-protective effect of hydrogen sulfide in cardiac cell culture and its potential therapeutic use in combination with cardioplegia formulations. MATERIAL AND METHODS We added hydrogen sulfide donor GYY4137 to HL-1 cells to study its protective effect in nutrient starved conditions. In addition, we tested the potential use of GYY4137 when it is added into two different cardioplegia formulations: Cardi-Braun\u00ae solution and del Nido solution in an ex vivo Langendorff perfused rat hearts model. RESULTS We observed that eight-hour pre-treatment with GYY4137 significantly suppressed apoptosis in nutrient-starved HL-1 cells (28% less compared to untreated cells; p<0.05), maintained ATP content, and reduced protein synthesis. In ex vivo experiments, Cardi-Braun\u00ae and del Nido cardioplegia solutions supplemented with GYY4137 significantly reduced the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 content and preserved ATP content. Furthermore, GYY4137 supplemented cardioplegia solutions decreased the S-(5-adenosyl)-L-methionine/S-(adenosyl)-L-homocysteine ratio, reducing the oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. Finally, heart beating analysis revealed the preservation of the inter-beat interval and the heart rate in del Nido cardioplegia solution supplemented with GYY4137. CONCLUSIONS GYY4137 preconditioning preserved energetic state during starved conditions, attenuating the cardiomyocytes apoptosis in vitro. The addition of GYY4137 to cardioplegia solutions prevented apoptosis, ATP consumption, and oxidative stress in perfused rat hearts, restoring its electrophysiological status after cardiac arrest.

Altered fatty acid metabolism during DCM can cause macrophage polarization in which inflammatory M1 phenotype dominates over the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Hence, it is essential to identify a specific target, which could revert the metabolic profile and thereby reducing the M1 macrophage polarization. 14-3-3\u03b7 protein has several cellular protective functions especially in the heart as plenty of reports available in various animal models of heart failure including diabetes mellitus. However, its role in the cardiac fatty acid metabolism and macrophage polarization remains unidentified. The present study has been designed to delineate the effect of cardiospecific dominant negative mutation of 14-3-3\u03b7 protein (DN14-3-3) on various lipid metabolism related marker proteins expressions and cardiac macrophage phenotype in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Feeding HFD for 12 weeks has produced significant increase in body weight in the DN14-3-3 (TG) mice than C57BL6/J (WT) mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining analysis of the heart tissue has revealed an increase in the expression of markers of cardiac fatty acid synthesis related proteins in addition to the reduced expression of fatty acid oxidation related proteins in TG mice fed HFD than WT mice fed HFD. Furthermore, the M1 macrophage marker proteins were increasingly expressed while M2 markers expressions were reduced in the hearts of TG mice fed HFD.

To date, the efficiency of this approach in preclinical applications is limited in part by our incomplete understanding of the inflammatory environment known to be present at the site of myocardial infarct and by poor vascularization. It was recently reported that polarized macrophages known to be present at the site of myocardial infarction secrete bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)-2 and -4 causing changes in the expression of cardiac proteins in a 2D in vitro model. Here, these findings were extended towards cardiac tissues composed of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes embedded in collagen gel. By preconditioning cardiac tissues with BMPs, constructs were obtained with enhanced expression of cardiac markers. Additionally, after BMP preconditioning, the resulting cardiac-tissues were able to sustain diffusion of the BMPs with the added benefit of supporting human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation. Here, a model is proposed of cardiac tissues preconditioned with BMPs that results in stimulation of cardiomyocyte function and diffusion of BMPs able to support angiogenesis.

Furthermore, histopathological studies were also conducted.\nWe found that alcohol-induced myocardial damage was associated with increased lipid profile except high density lipoprotein in alcohol treated (20%, 6g/kg b.w.) rats compared with control. Ginger treatment significantly reduced the alcohol-induced lipid profiles except high density lipoproteins.

However, it is still unclear whether the reprogrammed aged somatic cells can function normally as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) during development and be rejuvenated. In the current study, we applied the aggregation technique to investigate whether iPSCs derived from aged somatic cells could develop normally and be rejuvenated. iPSCs derived from bone marrow myeloid cells of 2-month-old (2\u2009M) and 18-month-old (18\u2009M) C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J mice were aggregated with embryos derived from wild-type ICR mice to produce chimeras (referred to as 2\u2009M CA and 18\u2009M CA, respectively). Our observations focused on comparing the ability of the iPSCs derived from 18\u2009M and 2\u2009M bone marrow cells to develop rejuvenated cardiac tissue (the heart is the most vital organ during aging). The results showed an absence of p16 and p53 upregulation, telomere length shortening, and mitochondrial gene expression and deletion in 18\u2009M CA, whereas slight changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure, cytochrome C oxidase activity, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species production were observed in CA cardiac tissues. The data implied that all of the aging characteristics observed in the newborn cardiac tissue of 18\u2009M CA were comparable with those of 2\u2009M CA newborn cardiac tissue.

Statins can also activate AMPK, resulting in the secretion of adiponectin. We determined whether atorvastatin inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis (AICF) in the presence or absence of adiponectin. Adiponectin knockout (APN-KO, n\u00a0=\u00a044) and wild type (WT, n\u00a0=\u00a044) mice were received subcutaneous angiotensin II (1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day), and atorvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 15\u00a0days. The mRNA expression levels of collagen type I and III, as well as AMPK phosphorylation levels in cardiac tissue were then measured. In the APN-KO mice, collagen type I (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and type III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) expression was significantly greater when treated with angiotensin II, while their expression was significantly reduced in the presence of angiotensin II and atorvastatin.

{"title": "Fgf21 is required for cardiac remodeling in pregnancy.", "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-21 (Fgf21) is an endocrine factor that contributes to many physiological and pathological processes, mainly via its action as a metabolic regulator. Recent studies have shown that Fgf21 plays an important role in cardiac tissue. Pregnancy offers a physiological model of adaptive and reversible heart enlargement, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this cardiac hypertrophy are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim was to analyze the role of Fgf21 during late pregnancy, and assess the physiological relevance of Fgf21 for cardiac tissue during this process.\nFemale mice and rats at day 18 of gestation and pregnant women in their third trimester were used as models of late pregnancy, and our results revealed that their plasma levels of Fgf21 were significantly increased relative to non-pregnant controls. Pregnant wild-type (wt) mice exhibited a PPAR\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1)-dependent enhancement of Fgf21 expression in the liver and heart. Moreover, pregnancy altered the levels of Fgf21 receptor-1 (FGFR1) and \u03b2-klotho, and activated intracellular Fgf21 signaling in the heart. Fgf21-/- mice did not develop the pregnancy-induced cardiac remodeling seen in wt mice. Furthermore, the hearts of Fgf21-/- mice exhibited reductions in their fatty acid oxidation levels, which may compromise cardiac function during pregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, both systemic and cardiac-produced Fgf21 act on the heart, leading to the normal physiological cardiac changes that are associated with pregnancy. Thus, Fgf21 acts as an endocrine/autocrine factor required for cardiac remodeling response to gestation.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2017-05-05", "authors": ["IbonRedondo-Angulo", "AleksandraMas-Stachurska", "MartaSitges", "Francisco Jos\u00e9Tinahones", "MartaGiralt", "FrancescVillarroya", "AnnaPlanavila"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvx088"}

Although we focus on encouraging blood vessel formation within myocardial implants, we also discuss techniques developed for other tissues that could eventually become relevant to engineered cardiac tissues.

Consequently, even improvements in short-term durability may have a potential impact on cardiac cell grafting.

In this study, we have tailored the material for cardiac applications through the inclusion of a heparin-binding peptide (HBP) sequence in the cross-linker design and formulated the gel to display mechanical properties resembling those of cardiac tissue. Luciferase-expressing cardiac stem cells (CSC-Luc2) encapsulated within these gels maintained their metabolic activity for up to 14 days in vitro. Encapsulation in the HBP hydrogels improved CSC-Luc2 retention in the mouse myocardium and hind limbs at 3 days by 6.5- and 12- fold, respectively.

{"title": "Adult murine cardiomyocytes exhibit regenerative activity with cell cycle reentry through STAT3 in the healing process of myocarditis.", "abstract": "Mammalian cardiomyocytes substantially lose proliferative capacity immediately after birth, limiting adult heart regeneration after injury. However, clinical myocarditis appears to be self-limiting with tissue-reparative properties. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the recovery from myocarditis with regard to cardiomyocyte proliferation using an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) model. Three weeks after EAM induction (EAM3w), cardiac tissue displayed infiltration of inflammatory cells with cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, by EAM5w, the myocardial damage was remarkably attenuated, associated with an increase in cardiomyocytes that were positively stained with cell cycle markers at EAM3w. Cardiomyocyte fate mapping study revealed that the proliferating cardiomyocytes primarily derived from pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was robustly activated in cardiomyocytes during inflammation, accompanied by induction of interleukin-6 family cytokines. Cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of STAT3 gene suppressed the frequency of cycling cardiomyocytes in the recovery period without influencing inflammatory status, resulting in impaired tissue repair and cardiac dysfunction. Finally, microarray analysis revealed that the expression of regeneration-related genes, metallothioneins and clusterin, in cardiomyocytes was decreased by STAT3 gene deletion.

Homozygous mutant embryos displayed nuclear abnormalities in cardiomyocyte nuclei. Expression analysis showed the upregulation of genes involved in heart regeneration in transgenic mutant embryos and a cell proliferation marker was increased in adult heart tissue. At the physiological level, there was deviation of up to 20% from normal heart rate in transgenic embryos expressing mutant lamins. Adult homozygous zebrafish were fertile and did not show signs of early mortality. Our results suggest that transgenic zebrafish models of heart-specific laminopathies show cardiac regeneration and moderate deviations in heart rate during embryonic development.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2017-05-04", "authors": ["Ajay DVerma", "Veena KParnaik"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.10784"}
{"title": "Noninvasive imaging in cardiac deposition diseases.", "abstract": "Infiltrative cardiomyopathy represents a heterogeneous group of diseases of the heart tissue with similar phenotypic expression. The condition is rare, but can be easily mistaken for other more common conditions of the heart. The diagnosis of infiltrative cardiomyopathy is therefore challenging and has often required the use of invasive procedures in the past. In the last decade there have been great advances in non-invasive cardiac imaging modalities like echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging. Although no single imaging modality abnormality on its own is pathognomic for infiltrative cardiomyopathy, a combination of these different modalities are synergistic, and can greatly aid in the clinical diagnosis. In this review, we describe these advancements in non-invasive cardiac imaging modalities with a particular focus on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.\n1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn.

Electrical stimulation (ES) of these constructs has been shown to produce tissues with greater twitch force and better adrenergic response. To further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effect of ES, we fabricated a bioreactor capable of delivering continuous or intermittent waveforms of various types to multiple constructs simultaneously. In this study, we examined the effect of an intermittent biphasic square wave on our artificial heart muscle (AHM) composed of neonatal rat cardiac cells and fibrin gel. Twitch forces, spontaneous contraction rates, biopotentials, gene expression profiles, and histologic observations were examined for the ES protocol over a 12 day culture period. We demonstrate improved consistency between samples for twitch force and contraction rate, and higher normalized twitch force amplitudes for electrically stimulated AHMs. Improvements in electrophysiology within the AHM were noted by higher conduction velocities and lower latency in electrical response for electrically stimulated AHMs. Genes expressing key electrophysiologic and structural markers peaked at days 6 and 8 of culture, only a few days after the initiation of ES. These results may be used for optimization strategies to establish protocols for producing AHMs capable of replacing damaged heart tissue in either a contractile or electrophysiologic capacity.

These interactions vary with heart development and pathology leading to changes in cardiac structure and function. Whether cardiac fibroblasts of different ages interact differentially with cardiomyocytes to distinctly impact their function remains unknown. Here, we explored the direct structural and functional effects of fetal and adult cardiac fibroblasts on cardiomyocytes using a tissue-engineered 3D co-culture system. We show that the age of cardiac fibroblasts is a strong determinant of the structure, function, and molecular properties of co-cultured tissues. In particular, in vitro expanded adult, but not fetal, cardiac fibroblasts significantly deteriorated electrical and mechanical function of the co-cultured cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by slower action potential conduction, prolonged action potential duration, weaker contractions, higher tissue stiffness, and reduced calcium transient amplitude. This functional deficit was associated with structural and molecular signatures of pathological remodeling including fibroblast proliferation, interstitial collagen deposition, and upregulation of pro-fibrotic markers. Our studies imply critical roles of the age of supporting cells in engineering functional cardiac tissues and provide a new physiologically relevant in vitro platform to investigate influence of heterocellular interactions on cardiomyocyte function, development, and disease.\nPrevious studies have shown that cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in the heart interact through direct contacts, paracrine factors, and matrix-mediated crosstalk. However, whether cardiac fibroblasts of different ages distinctly impact cardiomyocyte function remains elusive. We employed a tissue-engineered hydrogel-based co-culture system to study interactions of cardiomyocytes with fetal or adult cardiac fibroblasts. We show that the age of cardiac fibroblasts is a strong determinant of the structure, function, and molecular properties of engineered cardiac tissues and that key features of fibrotic myocardium are replicated by supplementing cardiomyocytes with expanded adult but not fetal fibroblasts.

{"title": "Deconvoluting Kinase Inhibitor Induced Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Many drugs designed to inhibit kinases have their clinical utility limited by cardiotoxicity-related label warnings or prescribing restrictions. While this liability is widely recognized, designing safer kinase inhibitors (KI) requires knowledge of the causative kinase(s). Efforts to unravel the kinases have encountered pharmacology with nearly prohibitive complexity. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, KIs show promiscuity distributed across the kinome. Here, to overcome this complexity, 65 KIs with known kinome-scale polypharmacology profiles were assessed for effects on cardiomyocyte (CM) beating. Changes in human iPSC-CM beat rate and amplitude were measured using label-free cellular impedance. Correlations between beat effects and kinase inhibition profiles were mined by computation analysis (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) to identify associated kinases. Thirty kinases met criteria of having (1) pharmacological inhibition correlated with CM beat changes, (2) expression in both human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and adult heart tissue, and (3) effects on CM beating following single gene knockdown. A subset of these 30 kinases were selected for mechanistic follow up. Examples of kinases regulating processes spanning the excitation-contraction cascade were identified, including calcium flux (RPS6KA3, IKBKE) and action potential duration (MAP4K2). Finally, a simple model was created to predict functional cardiotoxicity whereby inactivity at three sentinel kinases (RPS6KB1, FAK, STK35) showed exceptional accuracy in vitro and translated to clinical KI safety data. For drug discovery, identifying causative kinases and introducing a predictive model should transform the ability to design safer KI medicines.

Female pigs were subjected to MI induction by sponge permanent occlusion of left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) generating approximately 10% of injured LV area with minimum hemodynamic impact. We assessed tissue perfusion by real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) using commercial microbubbles before and following pASCs treatment.

Together, these arrays provide real-time, non-invasive data acquisition of both cardiac electrophysiology and contractility under physiological conditions and under drug stimuli.

In this article, we present how the geometry of microsystems and microenvironmental conditions (static and perfusion) influence the proliferation, morphology, and alignment of cardiac cells (rat cardiomyoblasts-H9C2). Additionally, studies of cell growth after incubation with verapamil hydrochloride were performed. For this purpose, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/glass microfluidic systems with three different geometries of microchambers (a circular chamber, a longitudinal channel, and three parallel microchannels separated by two rows of micropillars) were prepared. It was found that static conditions did not enhance the growth of H9C2 cells in the microsystems. On the contrary, perfusion conditions had an influence on division, morphology, and the arrangement of the cells. The highest number of cells, their parallel orientation, and their elongated morphology were obtained in the longitudinal microchannel. It showed that this kind of microsystem can be used to understand processes in heart tissue in detail and to test newly developed compounds applied in the treatment of cardiac diseases.", "journal": "SLAS technology", "date": "2017-04-22", "authors": ["AnnaKobuszewska", "EwelinaTomecka", "KamilZukowski", "ElzbietaJastrzebska", "MichalChudy", "ArturDybko", "PhilippeRenaud", "ZbigniewBrzozka"], "doi": "10.1177/2472630317705610"}

Serum levels of lipid peroxidation products, and oxidative stress markers showed significant increase in ISO-treated rats. Histopathological examination of heart tissue revealed focal areas of endocardium degeneration, mononuclear cells infiltration, fibrous tissue deposition, and increased thickness of the myocardium of left ventricle. Similar degeneration was also found in kidneys. Treatment with CoQ10 (100\u00a0mg/kg) significantly improved the oxidative stresses in ISO treated rats.

Remarkably, neonatal mice can regenerate their cardiac tissue for up to 6 days after birth, but this capacity is lost by day 7. In this study, we aimed to explore the expression pattern of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) during this period and examine the mechanisms underlying this process. We found that 685 lncRNAs and 1833 mRNAs were differentially expressed at P1 and P7 by the next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing. The coding genes associated with differentially expressed lncRNAs were mainly involved in metabolic processes and cell proliferation, and also were potentially associated with several key regeneration signalling pathways, including PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Hippo and Wnt. In addition, we identified some correlated targets of highly-dysregulated lncRNAs such as Igfbp3, Trnp1, Itgb6, and Pim3 by the coding-noncoding gene co-expression network.

{"title": "Expression of High Mobility Group Protein B1 in Cardiac Tissue of Elderly Patients with Coronary Artery Disease with or without Inflammatory Rheumatic Disease.", "abstract": "It is known from clinical practice and observational studies that elderly patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) bear a significantly increased risk for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. The molecular mechanism, however, is still not known. Recently, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous, highly conserved single polypeptide expressed in all mammal eukaryotic cells, has been identified to mediate myocardial dysfunction in vitro once released from the nuclei of cardiomyocytes.\nTo investigate whether HMGB1 and its receptors are expressed in cardiac muscles of elderly patients with CAD with or without IRD.\nHMGB1 and its 3 well-known receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4, were examined by immunohistochemistry on myocardial biopsy specimens from 18 elderly patients with CAD (10 with IRD, 8 without IRD). Furthermore, total HMGB1 protein levels were measured by Western blot from the cardiac biopsies in 5 patients with and 5 without IRD.\nPathologic cytosolic HMGB1 in cardiomyocytes was massively recorded in all patients with IRD, but only slightly expressed in 1 patient without IRD. Total HMGB1 levels were also consistently lower in myocardial muscle biopsies of patients with IRD compared to those without IRD. Furthermore, all 3 HMGB1 receptors were expressed in cardiomyocytes of all patients.\nThe increased cytosolic expression of HMGB1 in cardiomyocytes and the lower total amount of HMGB1 in the cardiac specimens of IRD patients is consistent with a greater release of HMGB1 from the myocardial nuclei in IRD than non-IRD individuals. Thus, the HMGB1 signaling pathways may be more easily activated in elderly CAD patients with concomitant IRD and trigger a detrimental inflammatory process causing severe cardiovascular problems. Therefore, targeting HMGB1 in IRD patients might reduce the risk for cardiovascular events.", "journal": "Gerontology", "date": "2017-04-21", "authors": ["MeiBruton", "IvanaHollan", "JulieXiao", "EvaLindroos", "KnutMikkelsen", "Stein ERynning", "KjellSaatvedt", "Sven MAlmdahl", "Helena EHarris", "Ingrid ELundberg", "CeciliaWick"], "doi": "10.1159/000471763"}

We have previously shown that late-gestation diabetes, especially in conjunction with a maternal high-fat (HF) diet, impairs cardiac functions in rat-offspring. This study investigated changes in genome-wide histone modifications in newborn hearts from rat-pups exposed to maternal diabetes and HF-diet. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed a differential peak distribution on gene promoters in exposed pups with respect to acetylation of lysines 9 and 14 and to trimethylation of lysines 4 and 27 in histone H3 (all, false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1). In the HF-diet exposed offspring, 54% of the annotated genes showed the gene-activating mark trimethylated lysine 4. Many of these genes (1) are associated with the \"metabolic process\" in general and particularly with \"positive regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis\" (FDR = 0.03); (2) overlap with 455 quantitative trait loci for blood pressure, body weight, serum cholesterol (all, FDR < 0.1); and (3) are linked to cardiac disease susceptibility/progression, based on disease ontology analyses and scientific literature.

{"title": "Notch Signaling in Ischemic Damage and Fibrosis: Evidence and Clues from the Heart.", "abstract": "Notch signaling is a major intercellular coordination mechanism highly conserved throughout evolution. In vertebrates, Notch signaling is physiologically involved in embryo development, including mesenchymal cell commitment, formation of heart tissues and angiogenesis. In post-natal life, Notch signaling is maintained as a key mechanism of cell-cell communication and its dysregulations have been found in pathological conditions such as ischemic and fibrotic diseases. In the heart, Notch takes part in the protective response to ischemia, being involved in pre- and post-conditioning, reduction of reperfusion-induced oxidative stress and myocardial damage, and cardiomyogenesis. Conceivably, the cardioprotective effects of Notch may depend on neo-angiogenesis, thus blunting lethal myocardial ischemia, as well as on direct stimulation of cardiac cells to increase their resistance to injury. Another post-developmental adaptation of Notch signaling is fibrosis: being involved in the orientation of mesenchymal cell fate, Notch can modulate the differentiation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts, e.g., by reducing the effects of the profibrotic cytokine TGF-\u03b2. In conclusion, Notch can regulate the interactions between heart muscle and stromal cells and switch cardiac repair from a pro-fibrotic default pathway to a pro-cardiogenic one.

Regenerative medicine has provided encouraging results, yet it has not addressed the focal defects causing CD and mainly related to the inefficient repair programme of the heart. In this scenario, stem cells have been broadly investigated and their paracrine effect proposed as a possible working strategy to boost endogenous mechanisms of repair and regeneration from within the cardiac tissue. The scientific community is now focusing on identifying the most effective stem cell secretome, as the whole of bioactive factors and extracellular vesicles secreted by stem cells and endowed with regenerative potential. Indeed, the adult stem cell-paracrine potential for cardiac regeneration have been widely analyzed with positive outcome. Nevertheless, low yield, invasive sampling and controversial self-renewal may limit adult stem cell application. On the contrary, fetal and perinatal stem cells, which can be easily isolated from leftover sample via prenatal screening during gestation or as clinical waste material after birth, can offer an ideal alternative. These broadly multipotent immature progenitors share features with both adult and embryonic stem cells, show high self-renewal, but they are not tumorigenic neither cause any ethical concern. While fetal and perinatal stem cells demonstrated to improve cardiac function when injected in the injured heart, the comprehensive characterization of their secretome for future applications is still at its infancy.

The hypercholesterolemic animals exhibited a significant increase in the cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) contents in cardiac tissue, as well as showed significant increase on atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index (CRI). Moreover, cardiac levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased in hypercholesterolemic animals, while the glutathione reduced (GSH) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were decreased. \u03b2-caryophyllene treatment reduced the cardiac lipid content, as well as decreased the AI and CRI.

Chromium (Cr) mineral is playing a crucial role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of combined chromium picolinate (CrPic) and atorvastatin treatment against hyperlipidemia-induced cardiac injury. Seventy-five male albino rats were divided into five groups (15 rats each). Hyperlipidemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of Triton X-100 (300\u00a0mg/kg body weight (b.w) (group \u0406\u0406). Treatment of hyperlipidemic rats was induced by daily administration of CrPic at a dose of 200\u00a0\u03bcg/kg b.w/day (group \u0406\u0406\u0406), atorvastatin at a dose of 10\u2005mg/kg/day (group IV), and combined treatment with both (group V) by gavage for 7\u00a0days. At the end of experiment, serum and heart tissues were obtained. Hyperlipidemia was confirmed by histopathology of heart tissues, marked serum dyslipidemia, increased atherogenic indices, and values of ischemia-modified albumin. In addition to increased values of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase enzyme and high relative expression levels of pentraxin-3 were observed. However, paraoxonase-1 activity was markedly decreased in the hyperlipidemic group. Significant improvement in all assessed parameters was observed in the rat group treated with both CrPic and atorvastatin.

{"title": "Cell Therapy Trials in Congenital Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Dramatic evolution in medical and catheter interventions and complex surgeries to treat children with congenital heart disease (CHD) has led to a growing number of patients with a multitude of long-term complications associated with morbidity and mortality. Heart failure in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome predicated by functional single ventricle lesions is associated with an increase in CHD prevalence and remains a significant challenge. Pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the progression of CHD, including single ventricle lesions and dilated cardiomyopathy, and adult heart disease may inevitably differ. Although therapeutic options for advanced cardiac failure are restricted to heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support, there is a strong impetus to develop novel therapeutic strategies. As lower vertebrates, such as the newt and zebrafish, have a remarkable ability to replace lost cardiac tissue, this intrinsic self-repair machinery at the early postnatal stage in mice was confirmed by partial ventricular resection. Although the underlying mechanistic insights might differ among the species, mammalian heart regeneration occurs even in humans, with the highest degree occurring in early childhood and gradually declining with age in adulthood, suggesting the advantage of stem cell therapy to ameliorate ventricular dysfunction in patients with CHD. Although effective clinical translation by a variety of stem cells in adult heart disease remains inconclusive with respect to the improvement of cardiac function, case reports and clinical trials based on stem cell therapies in patients with CHD may be invaluable for the next stage of therapeutic development. Dissecting the differential mechanisms underlying progressive ventricular dysfunction in children and adults may lead us to identify a novel regenerative therapy.

Following fasting, induction of Agpat2, 3, 4, and 5 was observed in the liver, Agpat2 and 3 in heart tissue, and Agpat1, 2, and 3 in whole brain tissue. As a result, the relative abundance profile of the individual homologues within specific tissues was found to be significantly altered depending on the nutritive state of the animal. These data demonstrate tissue-specific effects of fasting on the regulation of different Agpat that are implicated in supporting unique downstream glycerolipid synthesis pathways.", "journal": "Lipids", "date": "2017-04-14", "authors": ["Ryan MBradley", "Emily BMardian", "Katherine AMoes", "Robin EDuncan"], "doi": "10.1007/s11745-017-4251-4"}

However, There was no information about the effects of benidipine on I/R injury in the ovary and the damage of I/R-induced infertility.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the effects of benidipine on bilateral ovarian I/R injury and whether or not effective in the treatment of I/R-induced infertility in rats.\nForty-eight females, albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: IRC group (ovarian I/R group, n=12), IRB-2 group (ovarian I/R+2mg/kg benidipine group, n=12), IRB-4 group (ovarian I/R+4mg/kg benidipine group, n=12) and HG group (healthy group with sham operation, n=12). In IRB-2 and IRB-4 groups, two hours ischemia and two hours reperfusion was performed following orally benidipine administration.

Therefore, the susceptibility of triploid salmon to common infections such as salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causative agent of pancreas disease (PD), requires investigation. In this study, shortly after seawater transfer, diploid and triploid post-smolts were exposed to SAV type 3 (SAV3) using a bath challenge model where the infectious dose was 48 TCID50 ml-1 of tank water. Copy number analysis of SAV3 RNA in heart tissue showed that there was no difference in viral loads between the diploids and triploids. Prevalence reached 100% by the end of the 35-day experimental period in both infected groups. However, prevalence accumulated more slowly in the triploid group reaching 19% and 56% at 14 and 21 days post exposure (dpe) respectively. Whereas prevalence in the diploid group was 82% and 100% at the same time points indicating some differences between diploid and triploid fish. Both heart and pancreas from infected groups at 14 dpe showed typical histopathological changes associated with pancreas disease. Observation of this slower accumulation of prevalence following a natural infection route was possible due to the early sampling points and the exposure to a relatively low dose of virus. The triploid salmon in this study were not more susceptible to SAV3 than diploid salmon indicating that they could be used commercially to reduce the environmental impact of escaped farmed fish interbreeding with wild salmon.

In vitro cardiac models with vascular structures mimic the highly vascularized myocardium and provide interactions between endothelial cells, stromal cells and cardiomyocytes. Currently, human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have been shown to present immature morphology and fetal-like electrophysiological properties that may limit their use as physiological test platform. The aim of this study was to develop multicellular in vitro cardiovascular construct modeling human heart tissue. In the cardiovascular construct, hPSC-CMs were cultured with a vascular-like network formed by human foreskin fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells that served as a platform in the construct. Cardiomyocyte orientation, maturation, electrophysiological properties and drug responses of the cardiovascular construct were characterized and compared to CM monoculture. hPSC-CMs in cardiovascular construct showed elongated morphology and aligned with the vascular-like network. Electrophysiological properties and calcium metabolism of hPSC-CMs as well as response to E-4031 and adrenaline demonstrated normal physiological behavior. Increased expression of cardiac structural proteins and ion channels in cardiovascular construct compared to CM monoculture were detected. In conclusion, vascular-like network supports the structural and functional maturation of hPSC-CMs. Our results suggest that cardiovascular construct presents more mature in vitro cardiac model compared to CM monoculture and could therefore serve as an advanced test system for cardiac safety and efficacy assessment as well as a model system for biomedical research.", "journal": "Cytotechnology", "date": "2017-04-12", "authors": ["HannaVuorenp\u00e4\u00e4", "KirsiPenttinen", "TuulaHeinonen", "MariPekkanen-Mattila", "Jertta-RiinaSarkanen", "TimoYlikomi", "KatriinaAalto-Set\u00e4l\u00e4"], "doi": "10.1007/s10616-017-0088-1\n10.1042/CS20060003\n10.1016/j.scr.2009.11.004\n10.1152/physrev.00017.2002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1007/s12265-013-9510-z\n10.1126/science.1163267\n10.1093/toxsci/kfh100\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.05.011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.016\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.004\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.68.040104.124629\n10.1016/j.drudis.2008.06.011\n10.1242/dmm.008409\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.026\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1097/00005344-200403000-00007\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000068356.38592.68\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000140667.37070.07\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.034\n10.1159/000320514\n10.1089/scd.2009.0255\n10.1517/17460441.2014.886562\n10.1258/ebm.2010.010239\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038147\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073637\n10.1002/jbm.a.31578\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.3389/fphar.2010.00147\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0466\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.757286\n10.1152/ajpheart.00020.2003\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.15\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0247\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.041\n10.1007/s11626-013-9703-4\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07914.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558"}
{"title": "Bidomain Predictions of Virtual Electrode-Induced Make and Break Excitations around Blood Vessels.", "abstract": "Virtual electrodes formed by field stimulation during defibrillation of cardiac tissue play an important role in eliciting activations. It has been suggested that the coronary vasculature is an important source of virtual electrodes, especially during low-energy defibrillation. This work aims to further the understanding of how virtual electrodes from the coronary vasculature influence defibrillation outcomes.\nUsing the bidomain model, we investigated how field stimulation elicited activations from virtual electrodes around idealized intramural blood vessels. Strength-interval curves, which quantify the stimulus strength required to elicit wavefront propagation from the vessels at different states of tissue refractoriness, were computed for each idealized geometry.\nMake excitations occurred at late diastolic intervals, originating from regions of depolarization around the vessel. Break excitations occurred at early diastolic intervals, whereby the vessels were able to excite surrounding refractory tissue due to the local restoration of excitability by virtual electrode-induced hyperpolarizations. Overall, strength-interval curves had similar morphologies and underlying excitation mechanisms compared with previous experimental and numerical unipolar stimulation studies of cardiac tissue. Including the presence of the vessel wall increased the field strength required for make excitations but decreased the field strength required for break excitations, and the field strength at which break excitations occurred was generally greater than 5\u2009V/cm. Finally, in a more realistic ventricular slice geometry, the proximity of virtual electrodes around subepicardial vessels was seen to cause break excitations in the form of propagating unstable wavelets to the subepicardial layer.\nRepresenting the blood vessel wall microstructure in computational bidomain models of defibrillation is recommended as it significantly alters the electrophysiological response of the vessel to field stimulation. Although vessels may facilitate excitation of relatively refractory tissue via break excitations, the field strength required for this is generally greater than those used in the literature on low-energy defibrillation. However, the high-intensity shocks used in standard defibrillation may elicit break excitation propagation from the coronary vasculature.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2017-04-12", "authors": ["Adam JConnolly", "EdwardVigmond", "Martin JBishop"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2017.00018\n10.1038/ncomms11437\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.168112\n10.1529/biophysj.104.043091\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.04.015\n10.1007/s10439-012-0593-5\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2051227\n10.1152/ajpheart.00606.2009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109754\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2096425\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.965095\n10.1529/biophysj.107.110981\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.10.052\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.118106\n10.1103/PhysRevE.85.011909\n10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011283\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.03.026\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00511\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2292320\n10.1114/1.101\n10.1161/01.RES.27.5.811\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1007/978-3-642-01932-6_29\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1996.tb00548.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1996.tb00548.x\n10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021926\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.08.1001\n10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1106464\n10.1109/TBME.2002.802057\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.01.018\n10.1155/2013/134163\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-1261\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000334\n10.1161/01.RES.87.10.922\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.1159/000046485\n10.1006/jtbi.1999.0957\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.208101\n10.1113/jphysiol.2013.255109\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.04.027\n10.1161/01.RES.44.5.701\n10.1161/01.RES.50.3.342\n10.1007/BF02368075\n10.1109/10.563303\n10.1152/ajpheart.00968.2004\n10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78173-6\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.058101\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.03.010\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.03042.x\n10.1093/europace/eut330\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.017\n10.1016/0002-9149(75)90865-6"}

It's current investigative and therapeutic approaches are non-biological, rather unspecific (drugs), traumatizing (electrical shocks), or irreversible (ablation). Optogenetics is a new biological technique that allows reversible modulation of electrical function with unmatched spatiotemporal precision using light-gated ion channels. We therefore investigated optogenetic manipulation of anatomical re-entry in ventricular cardiac tissue.\nTransverse, 150-\u03bcm-thick ventricular slices, obtained from neonatal rat hearts, were genetically modified with lentiviral vectors encoding Ca2+-translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), a light-gated depolarizing ion channel, or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) as control. Stable anatomical re-entry was induced in both experimental groups. Activation of CatCh was precisely controlled by 470-nm patterned illumination, while the effects on anatomical re-entry were studied by optical voltage mapping. Regional illumination in the pathway of anatomical re-entry resulted in termination of arrhythmic activity only in CatCh-expressing slices by establishing a local and reversible, depolarization-induced conduction block in the illuminated area. Systematic adjustment of the size of the light-exposed area in the re-entrant pathway revealed that re-entry could be terminated by either wave collision or extinction, depending on the depth (transmurality) of illumination. In silico studies implicated source-sink mismatches at the site of subtransmural conduction block as an important factor in re-entry termination.\nAnatomical re-entry in ventricular tissue can be manipulated by optogenetic induction of a local and reversible conduction block in the re-entrant pathway, allowing effective re-entry termination.

In the present study, we analyzed cardiac tissue and plasma of children with cardiac hypertrophy (CH) secondary to CHD for the expression of 11 miRNAs specific to CH in adults. The results were compared with the miRNA expression patterns in tissue and blood of healthy children. In this way, we determined that miRNAs 1, 18b, 21, 23b, 133a, 195, and 208b constitute the expression profile of the cardiac tissue of children with CHD. Meanwhile, miRNAs 21, 23a, 23b, and 24 can be considered specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of CH in infants with CHD. These results suggest that CH secondary to CHD in children differs in its mechanism from that described for adult hypertrophy, offering a new perspective to study the development of this pathology and to determine the potential of hypertrophic miRNAs to be biomarkers for early CH.", "journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "date": "2017-04-07", "authors": ["Ma CS\u00e1nchez-G\u00f3mez", "K AGarc\u00eda-Mej\u00eda", "MP\u00e9rez-D\u00edaz Conti", "GD\u00edaz-Rosas", "IPalma-Lara", "RS\u00e1nchez-Urbina", "MKl\u00fcnder-Kl\u00fcnder", "J ABotello-Flores", "N ABalderr\u00e1bano-Saucedo", "AContreras-Ramos"], "doi": "10.1007/s00246-017-1607-8"}

In the current study, micropatterned fibrous scaffolds were developed to establish a CM co-culture system with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and endothelial cells (ECs) as a potential in vitro drug screening model. To pursue a biomimetic approach to influence CM behaviors, strip, oval and wave-patterned mats were constructed by deposition of electrospun fibers on lithographic collectors, followed by precise stacking for cell co-cultures. CMs, CFs, and ECs were located on the patterned scaffolds with controlled cellular distribution in the respective regions and no across condition was found. Compared with those after strip and oval-patterned co-culture, CMs co-cultured on wave-patterned scaffolds displayed significantly greater cell viabilities, larger cell elongation ratios, stronger expressions of cardiac-specific Troponin I, connexin 43 and sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and higher beating rates during 15 days of incubation. The responses of co-cultured CMs to quinidine, erythromycin and sotalol show good correlations with clinical observations in the beating rate and the prolongation of the contraction and relaxation time.

Noble gases have shown beneficial effects in preconditioning studies. Because emergency proceedings in the context of myocardial infarction require postconditioning strategies, we evaluated the effects of argon in such protocols on mammalian cardiac tissue.\nIn rat, cardiac I/R was induced in vivo by transient coronary artery ligature and cardiac functions were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-induced arrhythmias were evaluated in vitro using intracellular microelectrodes on both rat-isolated ventricle and a model of border zone in guinea pig ventricle. Hypoxia-reoxygenation loss of contractile force was assessed in human atrial appendages. In those models, postconditioning was induced by 5 minutes application of argon at the time of reperfusion.\nIn the in vivo model, I/R produced left ventricular ejection fraction decrease (24%) and wall motion score increase (36%) which was prevented when argon was applied in postconditioning. In vitro, argon postconditioning abolished H/R-induced arrhythmias such as early after depolarizations, conduction blocks, and reentries. Recovery of contractile force in human atrial appendages after H/R was enhanced in the argon group, increasing from 51% \u00b1 2% in the nonconditioned group to 83% \u00b1 7% in the argon-treated group ( P < .001). This effect of argon was abolished in the presence of wortmannin and PD98059 which inhibit prosurvival phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and MEK/extracellular receptor kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), respectively, or in the presence of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside, suggesting the involvement of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway.\nArgon has strong cardioprotective properties when applied in conditions of postconditioning and thus appears as a potential therapeutic tool in I/R situations.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2017-04-07", "authors": ["SandrineLemoine", "KatrienBlanchart", "MathieuSouplis", "AdrienLemaitre", "DamienLegallois", "LaurentCoulbault", "ChristopheSimard", "St\u00e9phaneAllouche", "Jacques HAbraini", "Jean-LucHanouz", "Ren\u00e9Rouet", "LaurentSall\u00e9", "RomainGuinamard", "AlainManrique"], "doi": "10.1177/1074248417702891"}

We meta-analysed heart rate association results from 104\u2009452 European-ancestry individuals from 30 cohorts, genotyped using the Exome Chip. Twenty-four variants were selected for follow-up in an independent dataset (UK Biobank, N\u2009=\u2009134\u2009251). Conditional and gene-based testing was undertaken, and variants were investigated with bioinformatics methods.We discovered five novel heart rate loci, and one new independent low-frequency non-synonymous variant in an established heart rate locus (KIAA1755). Lead variants in four of the novel loci are non-synonymous variants in the genes C10orf71, DALDR3, TESK2 and SEC31B. The variant at SEC31B is significantly associated with SEC31B expression in heart and tibial nerve tissue.

We also relate the biological properties and functions of the in vitro-generated CMs to those of their in vivo counterparts. Furthermore, we describe the main problem of current CM derivation methods - maturation of CMs. We subsequently discuss biochemical and physical stimuli that are used to overcome the maturation problems of in vitro-derived CMs. As a result, a more holistic approach with controllable environment and timing of specific stimuli for creation of more mature engineered heart tissues is described as well.

{"title": "Period doubling cascades of limit cycles in cardiac action potential models as precursors to chaotic early Afterdepolarizations.", "abstract": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage oscillations during the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials (APs). EADs are caused by drugs, oxidative stress or ion channel disease, and they are considered as potential precursors to cardiac arrhythmias in recent attempts to redefine the cardiac drug safety paradigm. The irregular behaviour of EADs observed in experiments has been previously attributed to chaotic EAD dynamics under periodic pacing, made possible by a homoclinic bifurcation in the fast subsystem of the deterministic AP system of differential equations.\nIn this article we demonstrate that a homoclinic bifurcation in the fast subsystem of the action potential model is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the genesis of chaotic EADs. We rather argue that a cascade of period doubling (PD) bifurcations of limit cycles in the full AP system paves the way to chaotic EAD dynamics across a variety of models including a) periodically paced and spontaneously active cardiomyocytes, b) periodically paced and non-active cardiomyocytes as well as c) unpaced and spontaneously active cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, our bifurcation analysis reveals that chaotic EAD dynamics may coexist in a stable manner with fully regular AP dynamics, where only the initial conditions decide which type of dynamics is displayed.\nEADs are a potential source of cardiac arrhythmias and hence are of relevance both from the viewpoint of drug cardiotoxicity testing and the treatment of cardiomyopathies. The model-independent association of chaotic EADs with period doubling cascades of limit cycles introduced in this article opens novel opportunities to study chaotic EADs by means of bifurcation control theory and inverse bifurcation analysis. Furthermore, our results may shed new light on the synchronization and propagation of chaotic EADs in homogeneous and heterogeneous multicellular and cardiac tissue preparations.", "journal": "BMC systems biology", "date": "2017-04-06", "authors": ["PhilippK\u00fcgler", "M A KBulelzai", "Andr\u00e9 HErhardt"], "doi": "10.1186/s12918-017-0422-4\n10.1126/science.7313693\n10.1038/343653a0\n10.1073/pnas.0809148106\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000570\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00346\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02118.x\n10.1007/s10955-006-9191-y\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.258103\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1501\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.05.019\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.09.017\n10.1093/cvr/cvt104\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150106\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151178\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.11.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130632\n10.1126/science.1519060\n10.1177/1087057115594589\n10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006849\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147231.69595.D3\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s10439-013-0833-3\n10.1088/0266-5611/25/12/123014\n10.1137/110834780\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.12.050\n10.1145/779359.779362\n10.1063/1.166424\n10.1016/j.bpj.2015.03.011\n10.1016/0167-2789(93)90286-A\n10.1007/s11571-011-9184-7\n10.1137/S1111111101394040\n10.1103/PhysRevE.71.056214\n10.1016/j.ejps.2008.09.013"}
{"title": "The first isolation and molecular characterization of Toxoplasma gondii from horses in Serbia.", "abstract": "Consumption of undercooked or insufficiently cured meat is a major risk factor for human infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Although horsemeat is typically consumed rare or undercooked, information on the risk of T. gondii from infected horse meat to humans is scarce. Here, we present the results of a study to determine the presence of T. gondii infection in slaughter horses in Serbia, and to attempt to isolate viable parasites.\nThe study included horses from all regions of Serbia slaughtered at two abattoirs between June 2013 and June 2015. Blood sera were tested for the presence of specific IgG T. gondii antibodies by the modified agglutination test (MAT), and samples of trypsin-digested heart tissue were bioassayed in mice. Cyst-positive mouse brain homogenates were subjected to DNA extraction and T. gondii strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers (MS).\nA total of 105 slaughter horses were sampled. At the 1:6 cut-off 48.6% of the examined horses were seropositive, with the highest titre being 1:400. Viable parasites were isolated from two grade type mares; both parasite isolates (RS-Eq39 and RS-Eq40) were T. gondii type III, and both displayed an increased lethality for mice with successive passages. These are the first cases of isolation of T. gondii from horses in Serbia. When compared with a worldwide collection of 61 type III and type III-like strains, isolate RS-Eq39 showed a combination of MS lengths similar to a strain isolated from a duck in Iran, and isolate RS-Eq40 was identical in all markers to three strains isolated from a goat from Gabon, a sheep from France and a pig from Portugal. Interestingly, the source horses were one seronegative and one weakly seropositive.\nThe isolation of viable T. gondii parasites from slaughter horses points to horsemeat as a potential source of human infection, but the fact that viable parasites were isolated from horses with only a serological trace of T. gondii infection presents further evidence that serology may not be adequate to assess the risk of toxoplasmosis from horsemeat consumption.

A colorimetric method was used to determine calcineurin enzymatic activity. Impaired cardiac function and compliance were observed in rats with DbCM. Increased collagen deposition in cardiac tissue was found. Furthermore, ATF6 signaling was activated, leading to intracellular calcium accumulation and NFAT activation which further initiated ECM gene expressions. Matrine administration recovered cardiac function and improved compliance by exerting inhibitory effects against ATF6 signaling- induced fibrosis. The high- glucose incubation induced ATF6 signaling activation in cultured CFs to increase the synthesis of ECM. Matrine blocked the ATF6 signaling in CFs to inhibit ECM synthesis within non- cytotoxic concentrations.

As concern the cells for re-cellularization, embryonic, foetal, adult, progenitor stem cells and also iPS have been proposed.Heart construction could be an alternative option for the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. It is based on the use of an extra-cellular matrix coming from an animal's heart and seeded with cells likely to reconstruct a normal cardiac function. Though de-cellularization techniques now seem controlled, the issues posed by the selection of cells capable of generating the various components of cardiac tissue are not settled yet. In addition, the recolonisation of the matrix does not only depend on the phenotype of cells that are used, but it is also impacted by the nature of biochemical signals emitted.Recent researches have shown that it is possible to use decellularized whole liver treated by detergents as scaffold, which keeps the entire network of blood vessels and the integrated extracellular matrix (ECM). Beside of decellularized whole organ scaffold seeding cells selected to repopulate a decellularized liver scaffold are critical for the function of the bioengineered liver. At present, potential cell sources are hepatocyte, and mesenchymal stem cells.Pulmonary regeneration using engineering approaches is complex. In fact, several types of local progenitor cells that contribute to cell repair have been described at different levels of the respiratory tract. Moving towards the alveoles, one finds bronchioalveolar stem cells as well as epithelial cells and pneumocytes. A promising option to increase the donor organ pool is to use allogeneic or xenogeneic decellularized lungs as a scaffold to engineer functional lung tissue ex vivo.The kidney is certainly one of the most difficult organs to reconstruct due to its complex nature and the heterogeneous nature of the cells. There is relatively little research on auto-construction, and experiments have been performed on rats, pigs and monkeys.Nevertheless, before these therapeutic approaches can be applied in clinical practice, many researches are necessary to understand and in particular the behaviour of cells on the decellularized organs as well as the mechanisms of their interaction with the microenvironment. Current knowledges allow optimism for the future but definitive answers can only be given after long term animal studies and controlled clinical studies.", "journal": "Bio-medical materials and engineering", "date": "2017-04-05", "authors": ["J-FStoltz", "LZhang", "J SYe", "NDe Isla"], "doi": "10.3233/BME-171633"}

In this study, we optimized the decellularization protocol with the umbilical artery to construct microporous 3-D scaffold which is suitable for the stem cells (SC) proliferation. The SD rats underwent proximal left coronary ligation and a 5-mm diameter microporous SC patch was implanted directly on the infarct area (SC patch group). The LV contractile function, regional myocardial wall compliance, and tissue histology were assessed 4 weeks after patch implantation. The MSC patch integrated to the local heart tissue and the neo-vessels have been observed in the MSC patch. The vessels in the MSC patch were positive for the CD31 (marker for the mature endothelial cells). The left ventricle wall was thicker in the MSC patch group than the control group (p<0.05 vs. empty patch group). And the LVEF has been improved in the MSC patch group than empty patch group (59\u00b16.7% vs. 31\u00b14.5%, p<0.05).\nOur results showed that the implantation of the MSC patch improved cardiac contractile function in heart infarction rat model.

However, no prior study had established a therapeutic role of miR-375 in ischemic myocardium. Therefore, we assessed whether inhibition of MI-induced miR-375 by LNA anti-miR-375 can improve recovery after acute MI.\nTen weeks old mice were treated with either control or LNA anti miR-375 after induction of MI by LAD ligation. The inflammatory response, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, capillary density and left ventricular (LV) functional, and structural remodelling changes were evaluated. Anti-miR-375 therapy significantly decreased inflammatory response and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the ischemic myocardium and significantly improved LV function and neovascularization and reduced infarct size. Repression of miR-375 led to the activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) and increased AKT phosphorylation on Thr-308 in experimental hearts. In corroboration with our in vivo findings, our in vitro studies demonstrated that knockdown of miR-375 in macrophages modulated their phenotype, enhanced PDK-1 levels, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression following LPS challenge. Further, miR-375 levels were elevated in failing human heart tissue.\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate that anti-miR-375 therapy reduced inflammatory response, decreased cardiomyocyte death, improved LV function, and enhanced angiogenesis by targeting multiple cell types mediated at least in part through PDK-1/AKT signalling mechanisms.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2017-04-04", "authors": ["Venkata N SGarikipati", "Suresh KVerma", "DarukeshwaraJolardarashi", "ZhongjianCheng", "JessicaIbetti", "MariaCimini", "YanTang", "MohsinKhan", "YujiaYue", "CindyBenedict", "EmilyNickoloff", "May MTruongcao", "ErheGao", "PrasannaKrishnamurthy", "David AGoukassian", "Walter JKoch", "RajKishore"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvx052"}

Melatonin levels increased in the periodontitis groups, and the Pm group had lower MDA levels and higher GSH-Px levels than the Ps group. These findings suggest that melatonin administration reduces MDA and increases GSH-Px levels in heart tissue, and these effects may be due to its antioxidant properties.

However, a comprehensive analysis of MHC proteoforms arising from sequence variations and post-translational modifications (PTMs) remains challenging due to the difficulties in purifying MHC (\u223c223 kDa) and achieving complete sequence coverage. Herein, we have established a strategy to effectively purify and comprehensively characterize MHC from heart tissue by combining size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and middle-down mass spectrometry (MS). First, we have developed a MS-compatible SEC method for purifying MHC from heart tissue with high efficiency. Next, we have optimized the Glu-C, Asp-N, and trypsin limited digestion conditions for middle-down MS. Subsequently, we have applied this strategy with optimized conditions to comprehensively characterize human MHC and identified \u03b2-MHC as the predominant isoform in human left ventricular tissue. Full sequence coverage based on highly accurate mass measurements has been achieved using middle-down MS combining 1 Glu-C, 1 Asp-N, and 1 trypsin digestion. Three different PTMs: acetylation, methylation, and trimethylation were identified in human \u03b2-MHC and the corresponding sites were localized to the N-terminal Gly, Lys34, and Lys129, respectively, by electron capture dissociation (ECD). Taken together, we have demonstrated this strategy is highly efficient for purification and characterization of MHC, which can be further applied to studies of the role of MHC proteoforms in muscle-related diseases.

One major issue that hinders their advancement to clinic is the persistence of undifferentiated iPS cells in iPS-derived tissue. In this report, we show that the CDKs inhibitor, Dinaciclib, selectively eliminates iPS cells without affecting the viability of cardiac cells. We found that low nanomolar concentration of dinaciclib increased DNA damage and p53 protein levels in iPSCs. This was accompanied by negative regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. Gene knockdown experiments revealed that p53 downregulation only increased the threshold of dinaciclib induced apoptosis in iPS cells. Dinaciclib also inhibited the phosphorylation of Serine 2 of the C-terminal domain of RNA Polyemrase II through CDK9 inhibition. This resulted in the inhibition of transcription of MCL-1 and the pluripotency genes, NANOG and c-MYC. Even though dinaciclib caused a slight downregulation of MCL-1 in iPS-derived cardiac cells, the viability of the cells was not significantly affected, and beating iPS-derived cardiac cell sheet could still be fabricated. These findings suggest a difference in tolerance of MCL-1 downregulation between iPSCs and iPS-derived cardiac cells which could be exploited to eliminate remaining iPS cells in bioengineered cell sheet tissues.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-04-01", "authors": ["KhaledAlsayegh", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "HidekazuSekine", "TatsuyaShimizu"], "doi": "10.1038/srep45577"}
{"title": "Fasting regulates EGR1 and protects from glucose- and dexamethasone-dependent sensitization to chemotherapy.", "abstract": "Fasting reduces glucose levels and protects mice against chemotoxicity, yet drugs that promote hyperglycemia are widely used in cancer treatment. Here, we show that dexamethasone (Dexa) and rapamycin (Rapa), commonly administered to cancer patients, elevate glucose and sensitize cardiomyocytes and mice to the cancer drug doxorubicin (DXR). Such toxicity can be reversed by reducing circulating glucose levels by fasting or insulin. Furthermore, glucose injections alone reversed the fasting-dependent protection against DXR in mice, indicating that elevated glucose mediates, at least in part, the sensitizing effects of rapamycin and dexamethasone. In yeast, glucose activates protein kinase A (PKA) to accelerate aging by inhibiting transcription factors Msn2/4. Here, we show that fasting or glucose restriction (GR) regulate PKA and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to protect against DXR in part by activating the mammalian Msn2/4 ortholog early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). Increased expression of the EGR1-regulated cardioprotective peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in heart tissue may also contribute to DXR resistance. Our findings suggest the existence of a glucose-PKA pathway that inactivates conserved zinc finger stress-resistance transcription factors to sensitize cells to toxins conserved from yeast to mammals.

Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a major component involved in GJIC in heart tissue, and its abnormal expression is closely associated with various cardiac diseases. Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are known to induce cardiovascular toxicity. However, the mechanisms through which GJIC plays a role in cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by SNPs remain unknown. The aim of the present study is to determine whether SNPs-decreased GJIC promotes apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes cell line (H9c2 cells) via the mitochondrial pathway using CCK-8 Kit, scrape-loading dye transfer technique, Annexin V/PI double-staining assays, and Western blot analysis. The results showed that SNPs elicited cytotoxicity in H9c2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. SNPs also reduced GJIC in H9c2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner through downregulation of Cx43 and upregulation of P-Cx43. Inhibition of gap junctions by gap junction blocker carbenoxolone disodium resulted in decreased survival and increased apoptosis, whereas enhancement of the gap junctions by retinoic acid led to enhanced survival but decreased apoptosis. Furthermore, SNPs-induced apoptosis through the disrupted functional gap junction was correlated with abnormal expressions of the proteins involved in the mitochondrial pathway-related apoptosis such as Bcl-2/Bax, cytochrome C, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that SNPs-decreased GJIC promotes apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, downregulation of GJIC by SNPs in cardiomyocytes is mediated through downregulation of Cx43 and upregulation of P-Cx43. These results suggest that in rat cardiomyocytes cell line, GJIC plays a protective role in SNPs-induced apoptosis and that GJIC may be one of the targets for SNPs-induced biological effects.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2017-03-31", "authors": ["Zhong-JunDu", "Guan-QunCui", "JuanZhang", "Xiao-MeiLiu", "Zhi-HuZhang", "QiangJia", "Jack CNg", "ChengPeng", "Cun-XiangBo", "HuaShao"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S127904"}

One of the major challenges in developing new treatments is the lack of understanding of the exact underlying biological and molecular mechanisms. Chronic cardiovascular diseases are the single most common cause of death worldwide, and sudden deaths due to cardiac arrhythmias account for approximately 50% of all such cases. Traditional genetic screening for genes involved in cardiac disorders is labourious and frequently fails to detect the mutation that explains or causes the disorder. However, when mutations are identified, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from affected patients make it possible to address fundamental research questions directly relevant to human health. As such, hiPSC technology has recently been used to model human diseases and patient-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate potential disease-causing genetic variants in their natural environment.

{"title": "Toward improved myocardial maturity in an organ-on-chip platform with immature cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "In\u00a0vitro studies of cardiac physiology and drug response have traditionally been performed on individual isolated cardiomyocytes or isotropic monolayers of cells that may not mimic desired physiological traits of the laminar adult myocardium. Recent studies have reported a number of advances to Heart-on-a-Chip platforms for the fabrication of more sophisticated engineered myocardium, but cardiomyocyte immaturity remains a challenge. In the anisotropic musculature of the heart, interactions between cardiac myocytes, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and neighboring cells give rise to changes in cell shape and tissue architecture that have been implicated in both development and disease. We hypothesized that engineered myocardium fabricated from cardiac myocytes cultured in\u00a0vitro could mimic the physiological characteristics and gene expression profile of adult heart muscle. To test this hypothesis, we fabricated engineered myocardium comprised of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with laminar architectures reminiscent of that observed in the mature heart and compared their sarcomere organization, contractile performance characteristics, and cardiac gene expression profile to that of isolated adult rat ventricular muscle strips. We found that anisotropic engineered myocardium demonstrated a similar degree of global sarcomere alignment, contractile stress output, and inotropic concentration-response to the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Moreover, the anisotropic engineered myocardium exhibited comparable myofibril related gene expression to muscle strips isolated from adult rat ventricular tissue. These results suggest that tissue architecture serves an important developmental cue for building in\u00a0vitro model systems of the myocardium that could potentially recapitulate the physiological characteristics of the adult heart. Impact statement With the recent focus on developing in\u00a0vitro Organ-on-Chip platforms that recapitulate tissue and organ-level physiology using immature cells derived from stem cell sources, there is a strong need to assess the ability of these engineered tissues to adopt a mature phenotype. In the present study, we compared and contrasted engineered tissues fabricated from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in a Heart-on-a-Chip platform to ventricular muscle strips isolated from adult rats.

At last, the effect and mechanism of Linarin on heart tissues were verified in the ischemia-reperfusion model of isolated hearts.\nThe proliferation activity of cell was inhibited while the apoptosis rate was increased after hypoxia-reoxygenation. However, Linarin could inhibit these two variations. It was found that these effects of Linarin were related with the activation of Nrf-2 through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the anti-oxidative enzymes, regulated by Nrf-2, were enhanced to against the oxidative stress caused by hypoxia-reoxygenation. And with the inhibition of oxidative stress, some proliferation and apoptosis related proteins such as NF-kB and Cytochrome C were adjusted to support the viability of cells.

{"title": "Gold Nanocomposite Bioink for Printing 3D Cardiac Constructs.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is the most convenient microfabrication method to create biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue constructs, which can be used to regenerate damaged tissue and provide platforms for drug screening. However, existing bioinks, which are usually composed of polymeric biomaterials, are poorly conductive and delay efficient electrical coupling between adjacent cardiac cells. To solve this problem, we developed a gold nanorod (GNR) incorporated gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based bioink for printing 3D functional cardiac tissue constructs. The GNR concentration was adjusted to create a proper microenvironment for the spreading and organization of cardiac cells. At optimized concentration of GNR, the nanocomposite bioink had a low viscosity, similar to pristine inks, which allowed for the easy integration of cells at high densities. As a result, rapid deposition of cell-laden fibers at a high resolution was possible, while reducing shear stress on the encapsulated cells. In the printed GNR constructs, cardiac cells showed improved cell adhesion and organization when compared to the constructs without GNRs. Furthermore, the incorporated GNRs bridged the electrically resistant pore walls of polymers, improved the cell-to-cell coupling, and promoted synchronized contraction of the bioprinted constructs. Given its advantageous properties, this gold nanocomposite bioink may find wide application in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Advanced functional materials", "date": "2017-03-24", "authors": ["KaiZhu", "Su RyonShin", "Timvan Kempen", "Yi-ChenLi", "VidhyaPonraj", "AmirNasajpour", "SerenaMandla", "NingHu", "XiaoLiu", "JeroenLeijten", "Yi-DongLin", "Mohammad AsifHussain", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "AliTamayol", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1002/adfm.201605352"}

{"title": "The cancer paradigms of mammalian regeneration: can mammals regenerate as amphibians?", "abstract": "Regeneration in mammals is restricted to distinct tissues and occurs mainly by expansion and maturation of resident stem cells. During regeneration, even subtle mutations in the proliferating cells may cause a detrimental effect by eliciting abnormal differentiation or malignant transformation. Indeed, cancer in mammals has been shown to arise through deregulation of stem cells maturation, which often leads to a differentiation block and cell transformation. In contrast, lower organisms such as amphibians retain a remarkable regenerative capacity in various organs, which occurs via de- and re-differentiation of mature cells. Interestingly, regenerating amphibian cells are highly resistant to oncogenic transformation. Therapeutic approaches to improve mammalian regeneration mainly include stem-cell transplantations; but, these have proved unsuccessful in non-regenerating organs such as the heart. A recently developed approach is to induce de-differentiation of mature cardiomyocytes using factors that trigger their re-entry into the cell cycle. This novel approach raises numerous questions regarding the balance between transformation and regeneration induced by de-differentiation of mature mammalian somatic cells. Can this balance be controlled artificially? Do de-differentiated cells acquire the protection mechanisms seen in regenerating cells of lower organisms? Is this model unique to the cardiac tissue, which rarely develops tumors? This review describes regeneration processes in both mammals and lower organisms and, particularly, the ability of regenerating cells to avoid transformation. By comparing the characteristics of mammalian embryonic and somatic cells, we discuss therapeutic strategies of using various cell populations for regeneration. Finally, we describe a novel cardiac regeneration approach and its implications for regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2017-03-24", "authors": ["RachelSarig", "EldadTzahor"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgw103"}

{"title": "Cardiac fibrosis in the ageing heart: Contributors and mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis refers to an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in cardiac tissue. Fibrotic tissue is stiffer and less compliant, resulting in subsequent cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Cardiac fibrosis in the ageing heart may involve activation of fibrogenic signalling and inhibition of anti-fibrotic signalling, leading to an imbalance of ECM turnover. Excessive accumulation of ECM such as collagen in older patients contributes to progressive ventricular dysfunction. Overexpression of collagen is derived from various sources, including higher levels of fibrogenic growth factors, proliferation of fibroblasts and cellular transdifferentiation. These may be triggered by factors, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, cellular senescence and cell death, contributing to age-related fibrotic cardiac remodelling. In this review, we will discuss the fibrogenic contributors in age-related cardiac fibrosis, and the potential mechanisms by which fibrogenic processes can be interrupted for therapeutic intent.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology", "date": "2017-03-21", "authors": ["LuLu", "JingbinGuo", "YueHua", "KevinHuang", "RuthMagaye", "JakeCornell", "Darren JKelly", "ChristopherReid", "DannyLiew", "YingchunZhou", "AihuaChen", "WeiXiao", "QiangFu", "Bing HuiWang"], "doi": "10.1111/1440-1681.12753"}
{"title": "HOTAIR functions as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate PTEN expression by inhibiting miR-19 in cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Sustained cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is related to a variety of physiological as well as pathological stimuli and eventually increases the risk of heart failure. HOTAIR has been identified as a competing endogenous RNA in multiple human biological processes. Whether lncRNA-HOTAIR is involved in the progress of CH and how it works still remain unknown. Herein, we found that HOTAIR was down-regulated, while miR-19 was up-regulated in both heart tissues from TAC-operated mice in vivo and cultural cardiomyocytes treated with Ang-II in vitro by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, HOTAIR expression was negatively correlated with miR-19 in TAC-operated mice. HOTAIR overexpression reduced cell surface area and the expression of hypertrophic markers ANP, BNP, and \u03b2-MHC in response to Ang-II stimulation as well as knockdown of miR-19. The further molecular mechanisms of HOTAIR action in CH demonstrated that HOTAIR may act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-19, thereby modulating the dis-inhibition of its endogenous target PTEN and playing an important role in inhibiting CH progress. These findings reveal a novel function of LncRNAs, which conduce to an extensive understanding of CH and provide novel research directions and therapeutic options for treating this disease.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2017-03-21", "authors": ["YanjunLai", "ShuaiHe", "LimingMa", "HongLin", "BiyunRen", "JingMa", "XinyuZhu", "ShifangZhuang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-017-3008-y"}
{"title": "Scutellarin protects against doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity and regulates its accumulation in the heart.", "abstract": "The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The present study investigated the effects of scutellarin against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats using pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic approaches.

As a category of bioactive molecules, peptides have been proved to participate in various biological processes. However, the role of endogenous peptides in the pathogenesis of TOF has not been studied. In this study, we performed a comparative peptidomic profile in the fetal heart of TOF and the control group for the first time by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Our data demonstrated that a total of 201 peptides derived from 176 precursor proteins were differentially expressed in the heart tissues of TOF fetuses compared with normal controls, including 41 upregulated peptides and 160 downregulated peptides. After analyzing the characteristics of these differentially expressed peptides and their precursor proteins, we found that these peptides were potentially involved in different biological processes, especially cardiogenesis and congenital anomaly of the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, we detected several extracellular matrix-derived peptides involved in our differentially expressed peptidomic profile. In summary, our study constructed a comparative peptidomic profile from the heart tissues of TOF fetuses and normal controls, and it identified a series of peptides that could potentially participate in heart development and TOF formation.

To test whether they could be involved in daunorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy (DACM), we determined expression patterns of myomiRs in two distinct models of DACM. We used 10-12 weeks old male Wistar rats. In the sub-acute model, rats were administered with six doses of daunorubicin (DAU-A, 3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., every 48\u00a0h). Rats were sacrificed two days after the last dose. In the sub-chronic model, anaesthetized rats were administered a single dose of daunorubicin (15\u00a0mg/kg, i.v., DAU-C). Age-matched controls (CON) received vehicle. Rats were sacrificed eight weeks later. Left ventricular (LV) functions (LV pressure, rate of pressure development, +dP/dt and decline, -dP/dt) were measured using left ventricular catheterization. Expressions of myomiRs (miR-208a, miR-499, miR-1 and miR-133a), markers of cardiac failure (atrial and brain natriuretic peptides genes; Nppa and Nppb) and myosin heavy chain genes (Myh6, Myh7, Myh7b) in cardiac tissue were determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of gp91phox NADPH oxidase subunit was detected by immunoblotting. Both DAU groups exhibited a similar depression of LV function, and LV weight reduction, accompanied by an upregulation of natriuretic peptides, and a decrease of Myh6 to total Myh ratio (-18% in DAU-A and -\u200925% in DAU-C, as compared to controls; both P\u2009<\u20090.05). DAU-C, but not DAU-A rats had a 35% mortality rate and exhibited a significantly increased gp91phox expression (DAU-C: 197\u2009\u00b1\u200933 versus CON-C: 100\u2009\u00b1\u200911; P\u2009<\u20090.05).

The lack of myomiRs expression, particularly in sub-chronic model, suggests the loss of control of myomiRs network on late progression of DACM.

However, its cardioprotective action following cardiac arrest is unknown. We examined the cardioprotective effects of nicorandil in a porcine model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation.\nVentricular fibrillation was induced electrically for 4min in anesthetized domestic swine, followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Sixteen successfully resuscitated animals were randomized to saline control (n=8) or nicorandil (n=8) groups. Nicorandil (150\u03bcg/kg) was administered by central intravenous injection at onset of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), followed by 3\u03bcg/kg/min infusion until reperfusion end. Sham-operated animals received surgery only (n=4). Hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 5, 30, 180, and 360min after ROSC. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by echocardiography at baseline and 6h after ROSC. The animals were euthanized 6h after ROSC, and the cardiac tissue was removed for analysis.\n6 h after ROSC, nicorandil had significantly improved all hemodynamic variables (all P<0.05) except the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure decline and heart rate (P>0.05) compared with the control group. Control animals showed elevated cardiac troponin I and lactate levels compared with sham animals, which were significantly decreased following nicorandil treatment (P<0.05). In the saline control group, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was largely reduced but subsequently rescued by nicorandil (P<0.05).

Recent studies show that both c-kit positive cardiac stem cells (CSCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are good candidates for stem cell therapy to treat heart failure; however, the exact mechanism of stem cell therapy in improving cardiac function of ischemic cardiomyopathy is not fully known. Our objective was to test our hypothesis that CSCs and/or BM-MSCs repair the damaged heart by boosting post-myocardial infarction (MI) angiogenesis in a paracrine manner.\nWe isolated and purified CSCs and BM-MSCs from rats. Intramyocardial injections of CSCs and/or BM-MSCs were performed at 28 days after MI. We applied cardiac ultrasound and histological analysis to evaluate the effect of cell therapy on cardiac function and cardiac remodeling. In vivo donor cell transplantation experiments showed that CSCs and/or BM-MSCs improved cardiac function after MI and reduced infarct size. However, in vivo cell tracking experiments showed that minimal donor cells remained in the myocardium after cell transplantation. Our further in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that transplantation of CSCs enhanced the expression of pro-angiogenic factors and boosted post-MI angiogenesis in the myocardium in a paracrine manner, which in part contributed to the effect of CSCs on cardiac recovery after MI. CSCs and BM-MSCs synergistically inhibited CSC/BM-MSC apoptosis and enhanced their proliferation in a paracrine manner. This resulted in a larger number of transplanted cells remaining in the post-MI myocardium after coinjection of CSCs and BM-MSCs, and therefore the accumulation of more pro-angiogenic factors in the heart tissue compared to transplantation of CSCs or MSCs alone. Consequently, transplantation of both CSCs and BM-MSCs was superior to transplantation of either CSCs or BM-MSCs alone to boost post-MI angiogenesis and improve cardiac function after MI.\nC-kit", "journal": "Journal of cardiac failure", "date": "2017-03-13", "authors": ["LuerBao", "QingshuMeng", "YuanLi", "ShengqiongDeng", "ZuorenYu", "ZhongminLiu", "LinZhang", "HuiminFan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardfail.2017.03.002"}

In diabetes, changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines are a key mechanism leading to cardiac fibrosis. We have previously demonstrated alteration of miR-146a in chronic diabetic complications. Here, we investigated the role of endothelial miR-146a in mediating inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy. To examine the effects of miR-146a on the inflammatory mediators, an endothelial specific miR-146a overexpressing transgenic mice (TG) using tie-2 promoter, was generated. We examined these mice and wild type littermate controls with or without STZ induced diabetes. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Cardiac tissues were examined for inflammatory cytokine mRNAs and proteins by real time RT-PCR or ELISA. Cardiac fibrosis was examined by histology staining. Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) and primary endothelial cells isolated from mice were used following incubation with various levels of glucose with or without miR-146a mimics or antagomir transfection. In hearts of wild type mice with diabetes, increased expression of inflammatory markers and extracellular matrix proteins (IL6, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, NF-\u03baB, Col1\u03b11, Col4\u03b11) were seen compared to wild type controls. These changes were prevented in the diabetic TG mice. In addition, WT diabetic mice showed cardiac functional abnormalities, which were improved in the diabetic TG mice. In vitro studies showed glucose induced increase the expressions of the above inflammatory cytokines and specific NF-\u03baB regulators (IRAK1 &TRAF6). Such changes were corrected in the HCMECs following miR-146a mimic transfection.

{"title": "Persistent fibrosis, hypertrophy and sarcomere disorganisation after endoscopy-guided heart resection in adult Xenopus.", "abstract": "Models of cardiac repair are needed to understand mechanisms underlying failure to regenerate in human cardiac tissue. Such studies are currently dominated by the use of zebrafish and mice. Remarkably, it is between these two evolutionary separated species that the adult cardiac regenerative capacity is thought to be lost, but causes of this difference remain largely unknown. Amphibians, evolutionary positioned between these two models, are of particular interest to help fill this lack of knowledge. We thus developed an endoscopy-based resection method to explore the consequences of cardiac injury in adult Xenopus laevis. This method allowed in situ live heart observation, standardised tissue amputation size and reproducibility. During the first week following amputation, gene expression of cell proliferation markers remained unchanged, whereas those relating to sarcomere organisation decreased and markers of inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy increased. One-month post-amputation, fibrosis and hypertrophy were evident at the injury site, persisting through 11 months. Moreover, cardiomyocyte sarcomere organisation deteriorated early following amputation, and was not completely recovered as far as 11 months later. We conclude that the adult Xenopus heart is unable to regenerate, displaying cellular and molecular marks of scarring. Our work suggests that, contrary to urodeles and teleosts, with the exception of medaka, adult anurans share a cardiac injury outcome similar to adult mammals.

{"title": "Biophysical properties of cardiomyocyte surface explored by multiparametric AFM.", "abstract": "PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (PeakForce QNM) multiparametric AFM mode was adapted to qualitative and quantitative study of the lateral membrane of cardiomyocytes (CMs), extending this powerful mode to the study of soft cells. On living CM, PeakForce QNM depicted the crests and hollows periodic alternation of cell surface architecture previously described using AFM Force Volume (FV) mode. PeakForce QNM analysis provided better resolution in terms of pixel number compared to FV mode and reduced acquisition time, thus limiting the consequences of spontaneous living adult CM dedifferentiation once isolated from the cardiac tissue. PeakForce QNM mode on fixed CMs clearly visualized subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and their loss following formamide treatment, concomitant with the interfibrillar mitochondria climbing up and forming heaps at the cell surface. Interestingly, formamide-promoted SSM loss allowed visualization of the sarcomeric apparatus ultrastructure below the plasma membrane. High PeakForce QNM resolution led to better contrasted mechanical maps than FV mode and provided correlation between adhesion, dissipation, mechanical and topographical maps. Modified hydrophobic AFM tip enhanced contrast on adhesion and dissipation maps and suggested that CM surface crests and hollows exhibit distinct chemical properties. Finally, two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform to objectively quantify AFM maps allowed characterization of periodicity of both sarcomeric Z-line and M-band. Overall, this study validated PeakForce QNM as a valuable and innovative mode for the exploration of living and fixed CMs. In the future, it could be applied to depict cell membrane architectural, mechanical and chemical defects as well as sarcomeric abnormalities associated with cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Journal of structural biology", "date": "2017-03-07", "authors": ["GeorgesSmolyakov", "MarieCauquil", "ChilderickSeverac", "V\u00e9roniqueLachaize", "C\u00e9lineGuilbeau-Frugier", "Jean-MichelS\u00e9nard", "C\u00e9lineGal\u00e9s", "EtienneDague"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsb.2017.03.001"}

In this study we examined whether an autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) could alleviate OE-induced cardiac injury. Rats were injected with 3-MA (15 mg/kg, iv) or saline before subjected to various intensities of OE, including no swim (control), 2 h swim (mild-intensity exercise, MIE), 2 h swim with 2.5% body weight overload (moderate OE; MOE), 5% overload (intensive OE; IOE) or 2.5% overload until exhausted (exhaustive OE; EOE). After OE, the hearts were harvested for morphological and biochemiacal analysis. The cardiac morphology, autophagosomes and apoptosis were examined with H&E staining, transmission electron microscopy and TUNEL analysis, respectively. Autophagy-related proteins to (LC3-II/I and Beclin-1) and apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2/Bax) were assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that compared with the control, MIE did not change the morphological structures of the heart tissues that exhibited intact myocardial fibers and neatly arranged cardiomyocytes. However, IOE resulted in irregular arrangement of cardiomyocytes and significantly increased width of cardiomyocytes, whereas EOE caused more swollen and even disrupted cardiomyocytes. In parallel with the increased OE intensity (MOE, IOE, EOE), cardiomyocyte autophagy and apoptosis became more and more prominent, evidenced by the increasing number of autophagosomes and expression levels of LC3-II/I and Beclin-1 as well as the increasing apoptotic cells and decreasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio. 3-MA administration significantly attenuated OE-induced morphological changes of cardiomyocytes as well as all the autophagy- and apoptosis-related abnormalities in MOE, IOE and EOE rats.

{"title": "Endogenous Natural Complement Inhibitor Regulates Cardiac Development.", "abstract": "Congenital heart defects are a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity, affecting >1% of all live births in the Western world, yet a large fraction of such defects have an unknown etiology. Recent studies demonstrated surprising dual roles for immune-related molecules and their effector mechanisms during fetal development and adult homeostasis. In this article, we describe the function of an endogenous complement inhibitor, mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated protein (MAp)44, in regulating the composition of a serine protease-pattern recognition receptor complex, MBL-associated serine protease (MASP)-3/collectin-L1/K1 hetero-oligomer, which impacts cardiac neural crest cell migration. We used knockdown and rescue strategies in zebrafish, a model allowing visualization and assessment of heart function, even in the presence of severe functional defects. Knockdown of embryonic expression of MAp44 caused impaired cardiogenesis, lowered heart rate, and decreased cardiac output. These defects were associated with aberrant neural crest cell behavior. We found that MAp44 competed with MASP-3 for pattern recognition molecule interaction, and knockdown of endogenous MAp44 expression could be rescued by overexpression of wild-type MAp44.

{"title": "Endothelial and smooth muscle cells derived from human cardiac explants demonstrate angiogenic potential and suitable for design of cell-containing vascular grafts.", "abstract": "Endothelial and smooth muscle cells are considered promising resources for regenerative medicine and cell replacement therapy. It has been shown that both types of cells are heterogeneous depending on the type of vessels and organs in which they are located. Therefore, isolation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells from tissues relevant to the area of research is necessary for the adequate study of specific pathologies. However, sources of specialized human endothelial and smooth muscle cells are limited, and the search for new sources is still relevant. The main goal of our study is to demonstrate that functional endothelial and smooth muscle cells can be obtained from an available source-post-surgically discarded cardiac tissue from the right atrial appendage and right ventricular myocardium.\nHeterogeneous primary cell cultures were enzymatically isolated from cardiac explants and then grown in specific endothelial and smooth muscle growth media on collagen IV-coated surfaces. The population of endothelial cells was further enriched by immunomagnetic sorting for CD31, and the culture thus obtained was characterized by immunocytochemistry, ultrastructural analysis and in vitro functional tests. The angiogenic potency of the cells was examined by injecting them, along with Matrigel, into immunodeficient mice. Cells were also seeded on characterized polycaprolactone/chitosan membranes with subsequent analysis of cell proliferation and function.\nEndothelial cells isolated from cardiac explants expressed CD31, VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 and showed typical properties, namely, cytoplasmic Weibel-Palade bodies, metabolism of acetylated low-density lipoproteins, formation of capillary-like structures in Matrigel, and production of extracellular matrix and angiogenic cytokines. Isolated smooth muscle cells expressed extracellular matrix components as well as \u03b1-actin and myosin heavy chain. Vascular cells derived from cardiac explants demonstrated the ability to stimulate angiogenesis in vivo. Endothelial cells proliferated most effectively on membranes made of polycaprolactone and chitosan blended in a 25:75 ratio, neutralized by a mixture of alkaline and ethanol. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells retained their functional properties when seeded on the blended membranes.\nWe established endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures from human right atrial appendage and right ventricle post-operative explants.

The present work is undertaken to investigate the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of Azolla microphylla (EAM) against the Isoproterenol (ISO) induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were pre-treated with EAM (250 and 500mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days along with ISO (85mg/kg; s.c.) on the 29th and 30th days. ISO-induced rats displayed significant diminution in cardiac antioxidant enzymes activities, increased lipid peroxidation and alteration in cardiac marker enzymes. The same group also displayed an increase in levels of serum lipid profiles and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) accompanied with a significant reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-10). Moreover, the histopathological investigations in the heart tissue of ISO-induced group exhibited myocardial necrosis and inflammation, which correlated with the increased immunoreactivity for Bax/iNOS, whereas an absence of reactivity for Bcl-2 proteins. However, in EAM pre-treated rats, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, cardiac marker enzymes, membrane-bound ATPases together with the levels of lipid profile, non-enzymatic antioxidants, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines were maintained at normalcy that was further supported by improving histopathological changes and myocardial architecture. The IHC results of EAM pre-treated rats indicate up-regulated and down-regulated expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax/iNOS proteins, respectively. Thus, the present study reveals that A. microphylla alleviates myocardial damage in ISO-induced cardiac injury and demonstrates cardioprotective potential which could be attributed to its potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. A possible mechanism for the protective effect is the elevated expression of endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes, anti-inflammatory cytokines, degraded lipid peroxidation products and improved energy metabolism of cardiac mitochondria, thus attenuating necrosis of the myocytes.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2017-03-02", "authors": ["Sreenath KunnathuparaBhaskaran", "PoornimaKannappan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.177"}

MicroRNAs play very important roles in various physical and pathological processes including cardiogenesis and heart diseases. In recent years, miR-20b has been implicated in various diseases such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular diseases. However, the function of miR-20b in the pathological progress of viral myocarditis has not been reported. In this study, we found that miR-20b was up-regulated in mouse heart tissues post Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. Bioinformatics analysis identified ZFP-148, a transcription factor that plays essential roles in the regulation of virus replication, is one of the predicted targets of miR-20b. MiR-20b expression was found to be up-regulated and ZFP-148 protein level was markedly repressed during viral myocarditis. Further studies demonstrated that miR-20b directly binds to the 3'-UTR of ZFP-148 and suppresses its translation. Moreover, aberrant expression of miR-20b promoted the expression of anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, suggesting that altered gene expression might promote cardiomyocytes survival in viral myocarditis.

We have recently reported that Zn supplementation beneficially modulates hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia, with attendant reduction of associated metabolic abnormalities in diabetic rats. The present study assessed the potential of Zn supplementation in modulating oxidative stress and cardioprotective effects in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats with streptozotocin, and groups of diabetic rats were treated with 5- and 10-fold dietary Zn interventions (0\u00b719 and 0\u00b738 g Zn/kg diet) for 6 weeks. The markers of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme activities and concentrations of antioxidant molecules, lipid profile, and expressions of fibrosis and pro-apoptotic factors in the cardiac tissue were particularly assessed. Supplemental Zn showed significant attenuation of diabetes-induced oxidative stress in terms of altered antioxidant enzyme activities and increased the concentrations of antioxidant molecules. Hypercholesterolaemia and hyperlipidaemia were also significantly countered by Zn supplementation. Along with attenuated oxidative stress, Zn supplementation also showed significant cardioprotective effects by altering the mRNA expressions of fibrosis and pro-apoptotic factors (by >50 %). The expression of lipid oxidative marker 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) protein in cardiac tissue of diabetic animals was rectified (68 %) by Zn supplementation. Elevated cardiac and hepatic markers in circulation and pathological abnormalities in cardiac and hepatic tissue architecture of diabetic animals were ameliorated by dietary Zn intervention.

Long-term pre-treatment that decreases carnitine and LCAC contents also reduces ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) damage; however, the duration of the post-treatment effects is not known. The aim of the study was to assess the post-treatment effects of the carnitine transport (OCTN2) inhibitor, methyl-GBB, on LCAC content and the duration of its cardioprotective effect. Male Wistar rats received methyl-GBB (5 mg/kg for 28 days), and the anti-infarction effects on Langendorff-perfused hearts and the acylcarnitine profile in cardiac tissues were measured up to 28 days following the end of the treatment. Methyl-GBB pre-treatment for 28 days decreased LCAC heart tissue content by 87%, and the infarct size was decreased by 57%. Fourteen days post-treatment, the LCAC content was still decreased by 69%, and the infarct size was decreased by 32% compared to Control. A significant Pearson correlation (r = 0.48, p = 0.026) was found between infarct size and LCAC tissue content in the methyl-GBB-treated rat hearts. The addition of 2 mM carnitine to isolated heart perfusate significantly diminished the methyl-GBB-induced decrease in LCACs and infarct size. In conclusion, the anti-infarction effect of methyl-GBB continues for at least 2 weeks post-treatment.

{"title": "Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) disease diagnosed on a British Columbia salmon farm through a longitudinal farm study.", "abstract": "Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an emerging disease of marine-farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), first recognized in 1999 in Norway, and later also reported in Scotland and Chile. We undertook a longitudinal study involving health evaluation over an entire marine production cycle on one salmon farm in British Columbia (Canada). In previous production cycles at this farm site and others in the vicinity, cardiac lesions not linked to a specific infectious agent or disease were identified. Histologic assessments of both live and moribund fish samples collected at the farm during the longitudinal study documented at the population level the development, peak, and recovery phases of HSMI. The fish underwent histopathological evaluation of all tissues, Twort's Gram staining, immunohistochemistry, and molecular quantification in heart tissue of 44 agents known or suspected to cause disease in salmon. Our analysis showed evidence of HSMI histopathological lesions over an 11-month timespan, with the prevalence of lesions peaking at 80-100% in sampled fish, despite mild clinical signs with no associated elevation in mortalities reported at the farm level. Diffuse mononuclear inflammation and myodegeneration, consistent with HSMI, was the predominant histologic observation in affected heart and skeletal muscle. Infective agent monitoring identified three agents at high prevalence in salmon heart tissue, including Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and parasites Paranucleospora theridion and Kudoa thyrsites. However, PRV alone was statistically correlated with the occurrence and severity of histopathological lesions in the heart. Immunohistochemical staining further localized PRV throughout HSMI development, with the virus found mainly within red blood cells in early cases, moving into the cardiomyocytes within or, more often, on the periphery of the inflammatory reaction during the peak disease, and reducing to low or undetectable levels later in the production cycle. This study represents the first longitudinal assessment of HSMI in a salmon farm in British Columbia, providing new insights on the pathogenesis of the disease.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-02-23", "authors": ["EmilianoDi Cicco", "Hugh WFerguson", "Angela DSchulze", "Karia HKaukinen", "ShaorongLi", "Rapha\u00eblVanderstichel", "\u00d8ysteinWessel", "EspenRimstad", "Ian AGardner", "K LarryHammell", "Kristina MMiller"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0171471\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2004.00549.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2004.00602.x\n10.1186/s12985-016-0554-y\n10.3354/dao059217\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2006.00710.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2008.00983.x\n10.1016/j.molimm.2016.04.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0107132\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037269\n10.1111/jfd.12285\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2012.01450.x\n10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.06.007\n10.3354/dao070183\n10.1186/1743-422X-7-309\n10.1186/1297-9716-43-27\n10.1016/j.fsi.2015.07.023\n10.1186/1297-9716-45-35\n10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0146229\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.09.074\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141475\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131638"}

This complex behavior has been studied previously using the bidomain formulation incorporating the Beeler-Reuter and Luo-Rudy dynamic ionic current models.

Here we utilize a recently developed parsimonious ionic current model with only two currents-a sodium current that activates rapidly upon depolarization INa and a time-independent inwardly rectifying repolarization current IK-which reproduces many experimentally measured action potential waveforms. Bidomain tissue simulations with this ionic current model reproduce the distinctive dip in the anodal (but not cathodal) strength-interval curve.

{"title": "Development of hydrogels for regenerative engineering.", "abstract": "The aim of regenerative engineering is to restore complex tissues and biological systems through convergence in the fields of advanced biomaterials, stem cell science, and developmental biology. Hydrogels are one of the most attractive biomaterials for regenerative engineering, since they can be engineered into tissue mimetic 3D scaffolds to support cell growth due to their similarity to native extracellular matrix. Advanced nano- and micro-technologies have dramatically increased the ability to control properties and functionalities of hydrogel materials by facilitating biomimetic fabrication of more sophisticated compositions and architectures, thus extending our understanding of cell-matrix interactions at the nanoscale. With this perspective, this review discusses the most commonly used hydrogel materials and their fabrication strategies for regenerative engineering. We highlight the physical, chemical, and functional modulation of hydrogels to design and engineer biomimetic tissues based on recent achievements in nano- and micro-technologies. In addition, current hydrogel-based regenerative engineering strategies for treating multiple tissues, such as musculoskeletal, nervous and cardiac tissue, are also covered in this review.

Here we investigated the protective effects of baicalin on cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and explored the potential mechanisms involved.\nC57BL/6J-mice were treated with baicalin or vehicle following transverse aortic constriction or Sham surgery for up to 8 weeks, and at different time points, cardiac function and heart size measurement and histological and biochemical examination were performed.\nMice under pressure overload exhibited cardiac dysfunction, high mortality, myocardial hypertrophy, increased apoptosis and fibrosis markers, and suppressed cardiac expression of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. However, oral administration of baicalin improved cardiac dysfunction, decreased mortality, and attenuated histological and biochemical changes described above. These protective effects of baicalin were associated with reduced heart and cardiomyocyte size, lower fetal genes expression, attenuated cardiac fibrosis, lower expression of profibrotic markers, and decreased apoptosis signals in heart tissue.

To understand this mechanism, 180day-old chicks, divided into two groups, C (control group) and L (low Se group), were fed with either a Se-sufficient (0.23mg/kg) or Se-deficient (0.033mg/kg) diets for 25days, respectively. Heart tissues and blood samples were collected. In L group, the activities of serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-myoglobin (CK-MB) increased and typical ultrastructural apoptotic features were observed. Se deficiency up-regulated the mRNA levels of Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase-3), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8 (Caspase-8), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (Caspase-9), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax), (P<0.05), whereas, the mRNA levels of Microtubuleassociated protein light chains 3-1 (LC3-1), Autophagy associated gene 5 (ATG-5), Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Dynein and Becline-1 were down-regulated (P<0.05). Noticeably, Microtubuleassociated protein light chains 3-2 (LC3-2) mRNA level increased (P<0.05) by 20%. Western blot results showed that Se deficiency decreased the expression of Becline-1 and LC3-1 protein, however, the expression of Bax, Caspase-3 and Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 12 (Caspase-12) increased at protein levels. The present study revealed that Se deficiency induced apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in chicken cardiomyocytes through Bax/Bcl-2 inhibition and caspases-mediated cleavage of Becline-1.

{"title": "Revealing the Concealed Nature of Long-QT Type 3 Syndrome.", "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5) are associated with the long-QT-3 (LQT3) syndrome. Nav1.5 is densely expressed at the intercalated disk, and narrow intercellular separation can modulate cell-to-cell coupling via extracellular electric fields and depletion of local sodium ion nanodomains. Models predict that significantly decreasing intercellular cleft widths slows conduction because of reduced sodium current driving force, termed \"self-attenuation.\" We tested the novel hypothesis that self-attenuation can \"mask\" the LQT3 phenotype by reducing the driving force and late sodium current that produces early afterdepolarizations (EADs).\nAcute interstitial edema was used to increase intercellular cleft width in isolated guinea pig heart experiments. In a drug-induced LQT3 model, acute interstitial edema exacerbated action potential duration prolongation and produced EADs, in particular, at slow pacing rates. In a computational cardiac tissue model incorporating extracellular electric field coupling, intercellular cleft sodium nanodomains, and LQT3-associated mutant channels, myocytes produced EADs for wide intercellular clefts, whereas for narrow clefts, EADs were suppressed. For both wide and narrow clefts, mutant channels were incompletely inactivated. However, for narrow clefts, late sodium current was reduced via self-attenuation, a protective negative feedback mechanism, masking EADs.\nWe demonstrated a novel mechanism leading to the concealing and revealing of EADs in LQT3 models. Simulations predict that this mechanism may operate independent of the specific mutation, suggesting that future therapies could target intercellular cleft separation as a compliment or alternative to sodium channels.", "journal": "Circulation.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) metabolism was examined in human explanted hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0= 25).\nThe dynamic range of the RAS was large, with equilibrium angiotensin levels being 8- to 10-fold higher compared with circulating angiotensin levels. In chronic HF patients receiving ACE inhibition, plasma Ang II was suppressed and plasma Ang-(1-7) was elevated, whereas acute HF and patients receiving angiotensin receptor blocker had higher plasma Ang II with lower Ang-(1-7) levels.

{"title": "Chronically elevated bilirubin protects from cardiac reperfusion injury in the male Gunn rat.", "abstract": "Bilirubin is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, as evidenced in conditions of mild hyperbilirubinaemia (Gilbert's Syndrome). Little is known regarding myocardial stress resistance in hyperbilirubinaemic conditions or whether life-long exposure modifies cardiac function, which might contribute to protection from cardiovascular disease.\nHyperbilirubinaemic rats and littermate controls underwent echocardiography at 3, 6 and 12 months of age, with hearts subsequently assessed for resistance to 30 min of ischaemia. Heart tissue was then collected for assessment of bilirubin content.\nNo difference in baseline cardiac function was evident until 6 months onwards, where Gunn rats demonstrated aortic dilatation and reduced peak ejection velocities. Additionally, duration of ventricular ejection increased progressively, indicating a negative inotropic effect of bilirubin in vivo. Ex vivo analysis of baseline function revealed reduced left ventricular pressure development (LVDP) and contractility in hyperbilirubinaemic rats. Furthermore, stress resistance was improved in Gunn hearts: post-ischaemic recoveries of LVDP (76 \u00b1 22% vs. 29 \u00b1 17% Control, P < 0.01) and coronary flow (96 \u00b1 9% vs. 86 \u00b1 16% Control, P < 0.01) were improved in Gunn hearts, accompanied by reduced infarct area (21 \u00b1 5% vs. 47 \u00b1 15% Control, P < 0.01), and ventricular malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content. Expression of myocardial nitric oxide-regulating genes including Nos1 and Noa1 were not significantly different.\nThese data reveal life-long hyperbilirubinaemia induces age-dependent hypocontractility in male Gunn rats, and improved stress resistance.

Pigs had been bred on approved farms (n = 75) located in the so-called Food Valley in Italy. Sera were examined for immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. gondii by modified agglutination test (MAT). Both heart and diaphragm samples from seropositive carcasses were processed for the presence of T. gondii DNA (B1 locus) by real-time PCR and high resolution melting (HRM) assay. Anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were detected in 2.1% of pig carcasses, with titers from 1:10 to 1:320. T. gondii DNA was detected in all (eight) seropositive carcasses and in 11 (5 heart and 6 diaphragm samples) of 16 samples; that is, it was detected in heart tissue in two subjects, in diaphragm tissue in three subjects, and in both muscle tissues in three subjects. Toxoplasma genotypes were determined in seven of eight carcasses: type III was identified in four carcasses, type II in two, and both III and II in one carcass. The serological findings and the molecular detection of T. gondii strains suggest that cured meat products obtained from industrially bred pigs may be potential sources of toxoplasmosis for humans. Our results provide novel, important information regarding the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of T. gondii in intensively reared pigs within this specific region of Italy, particularly because Parma ham from this region is known and consumed worldwide.

It is revealed that eEF2 interacted and be regulated by HSP70, which kept eEF2 as dephosphorylated status and preserved the function of eEF2 during MIR. In addition, HSP70 suppressed the nucleus translocation of phosphorylated eEF2, which inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis during myocardial reperfusion stage.

It affects 1% of the US population, 50% of which is caused by coxsackie B virus. Cardiac tissue is the prime target, and destruction of myocardium results in cardiac failure with fluid overload. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 57-year-old woman with fever, headache, neck pain, and generalized malaise. Her white blood cell count was 13\u00d710\u00b3 cells/mm\u00b3. Interestingly, lumbar puncture ruled out meningitis. An echocardiogram to evaluate elevated troponin revealed an ejection fraction of 30% with severe left ventricular global hypokinesis without valvular vegetations consistent with new-onset systolic heart failure. Cardiac MRI showed a small pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusion. As she continued to be febrile, a viral panel was ordered, revealing coxsackie B4 antibody titer of 1: 640 (reference: >1: 32 indicates recent infection) with positive Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid by PCR, consistent with viral myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS Coxsackie B virus myocarditis is rarely recognized and reported by the general internist in clinical practice, so we would like present our experience with an interesting clinical presentation of the viral prodrome. An estimated 95% people in the US are infected with Epstein-Barr virus by adulthood, but it remains dormant in memory B lymphocytes.

We demonstrate real-time photoacoustic imaging and spectroscopy (PAIS) using a wavelength-tunable visible laser and clinical ultrasound scanner to track cardiac drug delivery. The photoacoustic signal was initially calibrated using porcine myocardial samples soaked with a known concentration of a drug surrogate (DiI). Next, an in situ coronary artery was perfused with DiI for 20 min and imaged to monitor dye transport in the tissue. Finally, a partially DiI-coated stent was inserted into the porcine brachiocephalic trunk for imaging. The photoacoustic signal was proportional to the DiI concentration between 2.4 and 120 ?? ? g / ml , and the dye was detected over 1.5 mm from the targeted coronary vessel. Photoacoustic imaging was also able to differentiate the DiI-coated portion of the stent from the uncoated region. These results suggest that PAIS can track drug delivery to cardiac tissue and detect drugs loaded onto a stent with sub-mm precision.

Twenty eight days after ligation of bile duct, heart tissues were tested for apoptosis. The extent of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been calculated in heart tissues. The cirrhotic hearts exhibited structural defects and greater apoptosis. Chronic treatment of cirrhotic rats with L-NAME, a non-selective inhibitor of NO synthase, inhibited heart structural defects and reduced apoptosis of hearts. We also showed that cirrhotic rat hearts had an enhanced level of MDA and reduced activities of CAT, GSHPx and SOD. When the animals were treated by L-NAME chronically, the MDA level reduced and activities of CAT, GSHPx and SOD augmented in cirrhotic heart.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is capable of inducing angiogenesis and can boost stem cell-based therapeutic effects. However, high levels of VEGF can cause abnormal blood vessel growth and hemangiomas. Thus, a controllable system to induce therapeutic levels of VEGF is required for cell therapy. We generated an inducible VEGF-secreting stem cell (VEGF/hUCB-MSC) that controls the expression of VEGF and tested the therapeutic efficacy in rat myocardial infarction (MI) model to apply functional stem cells to MI. To introduce the inducible VEGF gene cassette into a safe harbor site of the hUCB-MSC chromosome, the transcription activator-like effector nucleases system was used. After confirming the integration of the cassette into the locus, VEGF secretion in physiological concentration from VEGF/hUCB-MSCs after doxycycline (Dox) induction was proved in conditioned media. VEGF secretion was detected in mice implanted with VEGF/hUCB-MSCs grown via a cell sheet system. Vessel formation was induced in mice transplanted with Matrigel containing VEGF/hUCB-MSCs treated with Dox. Moreover, seeding of the VEGF/hUCB-MSCs onto the cardiac patch significantly improved the left ventricle ejection fraction and fractional shortening in a rat MI model upon VEGF induction. Induced VEGF/hUCB-MSC patches significantly decreased the MI size and fibrosis and increased muscle thickness, suggesting improved survival of cardiomyocytes and protection from MI damage. These results suggest that our inducible VEGF-secreting stem cell system is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of MI.

The functional improvements in mESC-CM\u2009+\u2009fetal CF patches were associated with differences in structural remodeling and increased expression of proteins involved in cardiac function. To determine role of paracrine signaling, we cultured pure mESC-CMs within miniature tissue \"micro-patches\" supplemented with media conditioned by adult or fetal CFs. Fetal CF-conditioned media distinctly enhanced CM spreading and contractile activity, which was shown by pathway inhibitor experiments and Western blot analysis to be mediated via MEK-ERK signaling. In mESC-CM monolayers, CF-conditioned media did not alter CM spreading or MEK-ERK activation. Collectively, our studies show that 3D co-culture of mESC-CMs with embryonic CFs is superior to co-culture with adult CFs for in vitro generation of functional myocardium.

Although these therapies have been reported to be useful, there are many issues in terms of the durability, complications, limited donors, adverse effect of continuous administration of immunosuppressive agents, and high costs involved. Recently, regenerative therapy based on genetic, cellular, or tissue engineering techniques has gained attention as a new therapy to overcome the challenges encountered in transplantation medicine. We focused on skeletal myoblasts as the source of progenitor cells for autologous cell transplantation and the cell-sheet technique for site-specific implantation. In vitro studies have reported that myoblast sheets secrete cytoprotective and angiogenic cytokines such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Additionally, in vivo studies using large and small animal models of heart failure, we have shown that myoblast sheets could improve diastolic and systolic performance and enhance angiogenesis and antifibrosis as well as the expression of several cytokines including HGF and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) in the tissues at the transplanted site. Based on the results of these studies, we performed clinical trials using autologous myoblast sheets in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Some patients showed left ventricular reverse remodeling and improved symptoms and exercise tolerance. Recently, multiple medical institutions including our institution successfully conducted an exploratory, uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in subjects with ICM to validate the efficacy and safety of autologous myoblast sheets.

A positive association between telomere length and exercise training has been shown in cardiac tissue of mice. It is currently unknown how each bout of exercise influences telomere-length-regulating proteins. We sought to determine how a bout of exercise altered the expression of telomere-length-regulating genes and a related signalling pathway in cardiac tissue of mice. What is the main finding and its importance? Acute exercise altered the expression of telomere-length-regulating genes in cardiac tissue and might be related to altered mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. These findings are important in understanding how exercise provides a cardioprotective phenotype with ageing. Age is the greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Telomere length is shorter in the hearts of aged mice compared with young mice, and short telomere length has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. One year of voluntary wheel-running exercise attenuates the age-associated loss of telomere length and results in altered gene expression of telomere-length-maintaining and genome-stabilizing proteins in heart tissue of mice. Understanding the early adaptive response of the heart to an endurance exercise bout is paramount to understanding the impact of endurance exercise on heart tissue and cells. To this end, we studied mice before (BL), immediately after (TP1) and 1\u00a0h after a treadmill running bout (TP2). We measured the changes in expression of telomere-related genes (shelterin components), DNA-damage-sensing (p53 and Chk2) and DNA-repair genes (Ku70 and Ku80) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. The TP1 animals had increased TRF1 and TRF2 protein and mRNA levels, greater expression of DNA-repair and -response genes (Chk2 and Ku80) and greater protein content of phosphorylated p38 MAPK compared with both BL and TP2 animals.

{"title": "Neutrophils orchestrate post-myocardial infarction healing by polarizing macrophages towards a reparative phenotype.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Anti-inflammatory strategies to reduce neutrophil-driven acute post-MI injury have been shown to limit acute cardiac tissue damage. On the other hand, whether neutrophils are required for resolving post-MI inflammation and repair is unknown.\nWe show that neutrophil-depleted mice subjected to MI had worsened cardiac function, increased fibrosis, and progressively developed heart failure. Flow cytometry of blood, lymphoid organs and digested hearts revealed reduced numbers of Ly6Chigh monocytes in infarcts of neutrophil-depleted mice, whereas the number of macrophages increased, which was paralleled by reduced splenic Ly6Chigh monocyte mobilization but enhanced proliferation of cardiac macrophages. Macrophage subtype analysis revealed reduced cardiac expression of M1 markers, whereas M2 markers were increased in neutrophil-depleted mice. Surprisingly, we found reduced expression of phagocytosis receptor myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase, a marker of reparative M2c macrophages which mediate clearance of apoptotic cells. In agreement with this finding, neutrophil-depleted mice had increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells within infarcts. We identified neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in the neutrophil secretome as a key inducer of macrophages with high capacity to engulf apoptotic cells. The cardiac macrophage phenotype in neutrophil-depleted mice was restored by administration of neutrophil secretome or NGAL.\nNeutrophils are crucially involved in cardiac repair after MI by polarizing macrophages towards a reparative phenotype. Therapeutic strategies to reduce acute neutrophil-driven inflammation after MI should be carefully balanced as they might interfere with the healing response and cardiac remodelling.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["MichaelHorckmans", "LarisaRing", "JohanDuchene", "DonatoSantovito", "Maximilian JSchloss", "MaikDrechsler", "ChristianWeber", "OliverSoehnlein", "SabineSteffens"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehw002"}

{"title": "Involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 in liver ischemic conditioning induced cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.", "abstract": "Remote ischemic conditioning has been convincingly shown to render the myocardium resistant to a subsequent more severe sustained episode of ischemia. Compared with other organs, little is known regarding the effect of transient liver ischemic conditioning. We proposed the existence of cardioprotection induced by remote liver conditioning. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham-operated control (no further hepatic intervention) and remote liver ischemic conditioning groups. For liver ischemic conditioning, three cycles of 5 min of liver ischemia-reperfusion stimuli were conducted before-(liver preconditioning), post-myocardial ischemia (liver postconditioning), or in combination of both (liver preconditioning + liver postconditioning). Rats were exposed to 45 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, followed by 3 h of reperfusion thereafter. ECG and hemodynamics were measured throughout the experiment. The coronary artery was reoccluded at the end of reperfusion for infarct size determination. Blood samples were taken for serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB test. Heart tissues were taken for apoptosis measurements and Western blotting. Our data demonstrate that liver ischemic preconditioning, postconditioning, or a combination of both, offered strong cardioprotection, as evidenced by reduction in infarct size and cardiac tissue damage, recovery of cardiac function, and inhibition of apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion. Moreover, liver ischemic conditioning increased cardiac (not hepatic) glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) phosphorylation. Accordingly, inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 mimicked the cardioprotective action of liver conditioning. These results demonstrate that remote liver ischemic conditioning protected the heart against ischemia and reperfusion injury via GSK-3\u03b2-dependent cell-survival signaling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["ShuaiYang", "Geoffrey WAbbott", "Wei DongGao", "JinLiu", "ChaozhiLuo", "ZhaoyangHu"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00862.2016\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i10.621\n10.1097/00007890-200211150-00009\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)62001-8\n10.1038/35096075\n10.1097/00000542-199703000-00023\n10.1007/s00018-007-7045-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.9.2193\n10.1056/NEJMoa1413534\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.06.005\n10.1093/cvr/cvn114\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.85\n10.1096/fj.13-241828\n10.1093/cvr/cvw048\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165123\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.113.000315\n10.1007/s12630-008-9016-3\n10.1159/000103747\n10.1177/1074248415618816\n10.1093/cvr/cvs212\n10.1056/NEJMoa1413579\n10.1016/j.hlc.2015.09.008\n10.1253/circj.CJ-09-0284\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.169953\n10.1124/jpet.108.138008\n10.1053/j.jvca.2012.10.002\n10.1002/hep.510300622\n10.1016/S0041-1345(03)00571-2\n10.1177/1074248411409040\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.08.016\n10.1152/physrev.00054.2009\n10.1007/s00395-011-0210-z\n10.1161/01.RES.0000012567.95445.55\n10.2174/1381612820666140204120829"}

Moreover, the amount of glucose consumption and lactate production in the cardiac tissues and the amount of ammonia in the culture media decreased significantly when co-cultivated with algae. In the cardiac tissues devoid of algae, delamination was observed histologically, and the release of creatine kinase (CK) from the tissues showed severe cardiac cell damage.

{"title": "Comparative transcriptomics of elasmobranchs and teleosts highlight important processes in adaptive immunity and regional endothermy.", "abstract": "Comparative genomic and/or transcriptomic analyses involving elasmobranchs remain limited, with genome level comparisons of the elasmobranch immune system to that of higher vertebrates, non-existent. This paper reports a comparative RNA-seq analysis of heart tissue from seven species, including four elasmobranchs and three teleosts, focusing on immunity, but concomitantly seeking to identify genetic similarities shared by the two lamnid sharks and the single billfish in our study, which could be linked to convergent evolution of regional endothermy.\nAcross seven species, we identified an average of 10,877 Swiss-Prot annotated genes from an average of 32,474 open reading frames within each species' heart transcriptome. About half of these genes were shared between all species while the remainder included functional differences between our groups of interest (elasmobranch vs. teleost and endotherms vs. ectotherms) as revealed by Gene Ontology (GO) and selection analyses. A repeatedly represented functional category, in both the uniquely expressed elasmobranch genes (total of 259) and the elasmobranch GO enrichment results, involved antibody-mediated immunity, either in the recruitment of immune cells (Fc receptors) or in antigen presentation, including such terms as \"antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II\", and such genes as MHC class II, HLA-DPB1. Molecular adaptation analyses identified three genes in elasmobranchs with a history of positive selection, including legumain (LGMN), a gene with roles in both innate and adaptive immunity including producing antigens for presentation by MHC class II. Comparisons between the endothermic and ectothermic species revealed an enrichment of GO terms associated with cardiac muscle contraction in endotherms, with 19 genes expressed solely in endotherms, several of which have significant roles in lipid and fat metabolism.\nThis collective comparative evidence provides the first multi-taxa transcriptomic-based perspective on differences between elasmobranchs and teleosts, and suggests various unique features associated with the adaptive immune system of elasmobranchs, pointing in particular to the potential importance of MHC Class II. This in turn suggests that expanded comparative work involving additional tissues, as well as genome sequencing of multiple elasmobranch species would be productive in elucidating the regulatory and genome architectural hallmarks of elasmobranchs.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2017-01-31", "authors": ["Nicholas JMarra", "Vincent PRichards", "AngelaEarly", "Steve MBogdanowicz", "Paulina DPavinski Bitar", "Michael JStanhope", "Mahmood SShivji"], "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-3411-x\n10.1016/j.dsr2.2015.02.030\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066400\n10.1093/molbev/msq147\n10.1038/nature14065\n10.1517/17460441.2014.920818\n10.1038/nrg2703\n10.1038/320546a0\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.17.1.109\n10.1038/374168a0\n10.1073/pnas.95.20.11804\n10.1016/j.jmb.2006.12.045\n10.1089/hyb.2011.0010\n10.3390/antib2010066\n10.1007/BF00002518\n10.1086/423743\n10.1007/s10641-004-6588-9\n10.1073/pnas.1500316112\n10.1016/j.ympev.2012.02.012\n10.1073/pnas.1500524112\n10.1152/ajpregu.00254.2013\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0050101\n10.1038/nature12826\n10.1186/1471-2164-14-697\n10.1093/molbev/msq172\n10.1186/1471-2164-15-1074\n10.1002/jez.b.21427\n10.1016/j.cbd.2010.04.004\n10.1101/gr.130468.111\n10.1038/nature13685\n10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04487.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226936\n10.1038/nri3800\n10.1016/0300-9629(95)02058-6\n10.1016/S1055-7903(02)00333-0\n10.2174/1875036201307010001\n10.1038/nbt.1883\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btm071\n10.1093/nar/gkn916\n10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bti610\n10.1093/nar/gkn176\n10.1093/gbe/evu048\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btg455\n10.1093/nar/gks1147\n10.1186/1471-2172-10-3\n10.1093/molbev/msm088\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btl472\n10.1093/molbev/msi097\n10.1093/molbev/msv035\n10.1073/pnas.1300686110\n10.1042/bj1280617\n10.1186/jbiol155\n10.1186/s12864-015-1724-9\n10.1186/1471-2164-11-390\n10.1002/jez.b.22595\n10.1186/1471-2164-15-305\n10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04488.x\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.030\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2011.12.004\n10.1073/pnas.93.8.3289\n10.1002/eji.1830260525\n10.1073/pnas.0538029100\n10.1016/0167-5699(95)80008-5\n10.1073/pnas.0600291103\n10.1038/nsb0996-803\n10.1038/25379\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1642\n10.1172/JCI27648\n10.1016/S0305-0491(97)00272-1\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2260\n10.1021/np990514f\n10.1093/icb/icl041\n10.1021/ja307083b\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-15-0011\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90410-7\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01665-8\n10.2307/1443580\n10.1007/BF02568678\n10.1007/s00227-006-0380-7\n10.2989/1814232X.2010.538152\n10.1007/s00268-003-7397-6\n10.1177/0022034509359125\n10.1038/nri2206\n10.1016/j.jss.2006.05.029\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044164\n10.1098/rspb.2010.1274\n10.1126/science.493968\n10.1016/j.tree.2011.04.004\n10.1242/jeb.088880\n10.1074/jbc.M108413200\n10.1073/pnas.1323785111\n10.1002/hep.28142\n10.1038/ng.2926"}

The first one served as control while the second received a single injection of CP (200\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.).

Moreover, CP-induced oxidative stress as it elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) and diminished superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content in heart tissue. Additionally, CP-induced overexpression of toll-like receptors-4 (TLR-4) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) accompanied by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, NO). CP activated cardiomyocyte apoptosis as it increased apoptosis parameters (Bax and caspase-3) and decreased anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-2). On the other hand, MP treatment attenuated all of the measured parameters of CP-induced cardiotoxicity. MP counteracted CP-induced oxidative stress and suppressed TLR-4 and NF-\u03baB overexpression. Also, levels of cytokines and apoptotic markers were declined while Bcl-2 was elevated in MP treated animals.\nMP may serve as a new cardioprotective candidate.

Noise is inevitable in neuronal systems and can change the electrical activities of neuron in different ways. Many previous theoretical studies about the impacts of noise on spiral waves focus an unbounded Gaussian noise and even colored noise. In this paper, the impacts of bounded noise and rewiring of network on the formation and instability of spiral waves are discussed in small-world (SW) network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons through numerical simulations, and possible statistical analysis will be carried out. Firstly, we present SW network of HH neurons subjected to bounded noise. Then, it is numerically demonstrated that bounded noise with proper intensity \u03c3, amplitude A, or frequency f can facilitate the formation of spiral waves when rewiring probability p is below certain thresholds. In other words, bounded noise-induced resonant behavior can occur in the SW network of neurons. In addition, rewiring probability p always impairs spiral waves, while spiral waves are confirmed to be robust for small p, thus shortcut-induced phase transition of spiral wave with the increase of p is induced. Furthermore, statistical factors of synchronization are calculated to discern the phase transition of spatial pattern, and it is confirmed that larger factor of synchronization is approached with increasing of rewiring probability p, and the stability of spiral wave is destroyed.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-01-28", "authors": ["YuangenYao", "HaiyouDeng", "ChengzhangMa", "MingYi", "JunMa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0171273\n10.1097/WCO.0b013e32832d93dd\n10.1038/nature11129\n10.1038/nn.3304\n10.1073/pnas.0701519104\n10.1002/neu.480140503\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.230602\n10.1038/378362a0\n10.1103/PhysRevE.84.031916\n10.1063/1.4938733\n10.1038/30918"}

Catheter ablation, a minimally invasive procedure deactivating abnormal firing cardiac tissue, is increasingly becoming the therapy of choice for atrial fibrillation. This is inevitably associated with the obliteration of cardiac cholinergic neurons. However, the impact on ventricular electrophysiology is unclear. Here we show that cardiac cholinergic neurons modulate ventricular electrophysiology. Mechanical disruption or pharmacological blockade of parasympathetic innervation shortens ventricular refractory periods, increases the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and decreases ventricular cAMP levels in murine hearts. Immunohistochemistry confirmed ventricular cholinergic innervation, revealing parasympathetic fibres running from the atria to the ventricles parallel to sympathetic fibres. In humans, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, which is accompanied by accidental parasympathetic and concomitant sympathetic denervation, raises the burden of premature ventricular complexes.

{"title": "Glycation abolishes the cardioprotective effects of albumin during ex\u00a0vivo ischemia-reperfusion.", "abstract": "Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress plays a key role in the onset/progression of cardiovascular diseases. For example, it can trigger formation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products with ischemia-reperfusion performed under hyperglycemic conditions. For this study, we hypothesized that albumin modified by glycation loses its unique cardioprotective properties in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion under high glucose conditions. Here, ex\u00a0vivo rat heart perfusions were performed under simulated normo- and hyperglycemic conditions, that is Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11\u00a0mmol/L and 33\u00a0mmol/L glucose, respectively, \u00b1 normal or glycated albumin preparations. The perfusion protocol consisted of a 60\u00a0min stabilization step that was followed by 20\u00a0min of global ischemia and 60\u00a0min reperfusion. Additional experiments were completed to determine infarct sizes in response to 20\u00a0min regional ischemia and 120\u00a0min reperfusion. At the end of perfusions, heart tissues were isolated and evaluated for activation of the AGE pathway, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Our data reveal that native bovine serum albumin treatment elicited cardioprotection (improved functional recovery, decreased infarct sizes) under high glucose conditions together with enhanced myocardial antioxidant capacity.

Both diseases are characterized by structural valve disarray and a previous proteomic analysis of them has disclosed a distinct profile of matrix/structural proteins differentially expressed. Given their relevance in organizing valve tissue, we quantitatively evaluated the expression of vimentin, collagen VI, lumican, and vitronectin as well as performed immunohistochemical analysis of their distribution in valve tissue lesions of patients in both diseases. We identified abundant expression of two isoforms of vimentin (45 kDa, 42 kDa) with reduced expression of the full-size protein (54 kDa) in RHD valves. We also found increased vitronectin expression, reduced collagen VI expression and similar lumican expression between RHD and MXD valves.

ANP is synthesized by atrial cardiomyocytes as a preprohormone that is processed by a signal peptidase and stored in secretory granules as a prohormone. Subsequent proteolytic processing of ANP by corin during the secretion process results in a bioactive form consisting of 28 amino acid residues. Mechanical stretch of the atrial wall and multiple humoral factors directly stimulates the transcription and secretion of ANP. Secreted ANP elicits natriuretic and diuretic effects via cyclic guanosine monophosphate produced through binding to the guanylyl cyclase-A/natriuretic peptide receptor-A. Circulating ANP is subjected to rapid clearance by a natriuretic peptide receptor-C-mediated mechanism and proteolytic degradation by neutral endopeptidase. In humans, ANP is present as three endogenous molecular forms: bioactive \u03b1-ANP, a homodimer of \u03b1-ANP designated as \u03b2-ANP, and an ANP precursor designated as proANP (also referred to as \u03b3-ANP). The proANP and especially \u03b2-ANP, as minor forms in circulation, are notably increased in patients with cardiac diseases, suggesting the utility of monitoring the pathophysiological conditions that result in abnormal proANP processing that cannot be monitored by inactive N-terminal proANP-related fragments. Emerging plate-based sandwich immunoassays for individual quantitation of the three ANP forms enables evaluation of diagnostic implications and net ANP bioactivity.

{"title": "Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis is an underrecognized condition, in which delays to diagnosis have great implications on management options, prognosis, and morbidity. Once cardiac tissue is infiltrated by amyloid fibrils, there is a cascade of pathologic changes that can display an array of clinical manifestations, from impaired relaxation of the ventricular myocardium to severe restrictive disease or even progressive systolic heart failure. Management is guided not only by recognizing the subtype of amyloidosis (primary, hereditary, and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis), but also the clinical stage of the disease. It is important for those managing such patients to understand and differentiate disease associated with fibrils composed of transthyretin vs light-chain proteins. Kappa- and lambda-light chains of primary amyloidosis are particularly toxic to myocytes, leading to accelerated clinical illness in the face of intolerance to treatment and poor survival. Limitations to treatment of primary cardiac amyloidosis are related to multiorgan dysfunction and the inability to tolerate appropriate chemotherapy. Bortezomib, a selective protease inhibitor, has been shown to be and an effective and tolerable option for those with myocardial amyloid infiltration. Standard goal-directed optimal medical management for cardiomyopathy (such as beta-blockers and ace inhibitors) does not offer a survival benefit with cardiac amyloidosis, and often is associated with adverse effects. Despite advances in treatment of advanced heart failure therapy, end-stage cardiomyopathy in the setting of amyloidosis is not well stabilized by inotropes or mechanical circulatory support, and offers restricted candidacy for heart transplantation.

However, the underlying mechanisms of iPSC-derived cell therapy are still unclear, and limited engraftment of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes is well known. One facet of their mechanism is the paracrine effect of the transplanted cells. Microvesicles such as exosomes secreted from the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exert protective effects by transferring the endogenous molecules to salvage the injured neighboring cells by regulating apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we will focus on the current advances in the exosomes from iPSC derivatives and discuss their therapeutic potential in the treatment of CVD.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2017-01-21", "authors": ["Ji-HyeJung", "XuebinFu", "Phillip CYang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309307"}
{"title": "Progressive heart disease in mucopolysaccharidosis type I mice may be mediated by increased cathepsin B activity.", "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal disorder characterized by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase and storage of undegraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Clinical findings of the disease include heart failure, and patients often need valve replacement. It has been shown that, later in life, MPS I mice develop those abnormalities, but to date, there have not been studies on the progression and pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated heart function in normal and MPS I male mice from 2 to 8 months of age. Echocardiographic analysis showed left ventricular enlargement with progressive reduction in ejection fraction, fractional area change, and left ventricular fractional shortening in the MPS I hearts at 6 and 8 months of age and a reduction in acceleration time/ejection time ratio of the pulmonary artery starting at 6 months of age, which suggests pulmonary vascular resistance. Histological and biochemical analysis confirmed progressive GAG storage from 2 months of age and onwards in the myocardium and heart valves, which had also increased in thickness. Additionally, macrophages were present in the MPS I heart tissue. Collagen content was reduced in the MPS I mouse valves. Cathepsin B, an enzyme that is known to be able to degrade collagen and is involved in heart dilatation, displayed a marked elevation in activity in the MPS I mice and could be responsible for the heart dilatation and valves alterations observed. Our results suggest that the MPS I mice have progressive heart failure and valve disease, which may be caused by cathepsin B overexpression.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2017-01-21", "authors": ["GuilhermeBaldo", "Angela Maria VicenteTavares", "EstebanGonzalez", "EdinaPoletto", "Fabiana QuoosMayer", "Ursula da SilveiraMatte", "RobertoGiugliani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2017.01.001"}

{"title": "Exo-organoplasty interventions: A brief review of past, present and future directions for advance heart failure management.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease in which abnormal function of the heart leads to imbalance of blood demand to tissues and organs. The pathogenesis of HF is very complex and various factors can contribute including myocardial infarction, ischemia, hypertension and genetic cardiomyopathies. HF is the leading cause of death and its prevalence is expected to increase in parallel with the population age. Different kind of therapeutic approaches including lifestyle modification, medication and pacemakers are used for HF patients in NYHA I-III functional class. However, for advance stage HF patient's (NYHA IV), ventricle assist devices are clinically use and stem cells are under active investigation. Most of these therapies leads to modest symptoms relief and have no significant role in long-term survival rate. Currently there is no effective treatment for advance HF except heart transplantation, which is still remain clinically insignificant because of donor pool limitation. As HF is a result of multiple etiologies therefore multi-functional therapeutic platform is needed. Exo-organoplasty interventions are studied from almost one century. The major goals of these interventions are to treat various kind of heart disease from outside the heart muscle without having direct contact with blood. Various kind of interventions (devices and techniques) are developed in this arena with the passage of time. The purpose of this review is to describe the theory behind intervention devices, the devices themselves, their clinical results, advantages and limitations.

We present a soft robotic sleeve that is implanted around the heart and actively compresses and twists to act as a cardiac ventricular assist device. The sleeve does not contact blood, obviating the need for anticoagulation therapy or blood thinners, and reduces complications with current ventricular assist devices, such as clotting and infection. Our approach used a biologically inspired design to orient individual contracting elements or actuators in a layered helical and circumferential fashion, mimicking the orientation of the outer two muscle layers of the mammalian heart. The resulting implantable soft robot mimicked the form and function of the native heart, with a stiffness value of the same order of magnitude as that of the heart tissue. We demonstrated feasibility of this soft sleeve device for supporting heart function in a porcine model of acute heart failure.

However, the reports on the impact of HPMA-DOX conjugates on the cardiovascular system such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were in restrained animals using tail cuff and/or other methods that lacked the resolution and sensitivity. Herein, we employed radiotelemetric-spectral-echocardiography approach to further understand the in vivo cardiovascular hemodynamics and variability post administration of free DOX and HPMA-DOX. Rats implanted with radio-telemetry device were administered intravenously with DOX (5\u2009mg/kg), HPMA-DOX (5\u2009mg DOX equivalent/kg) and HPMA copolymer and subjected to continuous cardiovascular monitoring and echocardiography for 140 days. We found that DOX-treated rats had ruffled fur, reduced body weight (BW) and a low survival rate. Although BP and HR were normal, spectral analysis indicated that their BP and HR variabilities were reduced. All rats exhibited typical signs of cardiotoxicity at histopathology. In contrast, HPMA-DOX rats gained weight over time and survived. Although BP, HR and related variabilities were unaffected, the left ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV) of these rats, as well as of the HPMA copolymer-treated rats, was found increased at the end of observation period. Additionally, HPMA copolymer caused microscopic injury of the heart tissue. All of these suggest the necessity of caution when employing HPMA as carrier for prolonged drug delivery.

In primary cardiac tissue and in fibroblasts from the myosin VI-null mouse as well as in tissue culture cells transfected with siRNA against myosin VI, we observe reduced GJ plaque size with a concomitant reduction in intercellular communication, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and a new method of selective calcein administration. Analysis of the molecular role of myosin VI in Cx43 trafficking indicates that myosin VI is dispensable for the delivery of Cx43 to the cell surface and connexon movement in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we cannot corroborate clathrin or Dab2 localization at gap junctions and we do not observe a function for the myosin-VI-Dab2 complex in clathrin-dependent endocytosis of annular gap junctions. Instead, we found that myosin VI was localized at the edge of Cx43 plaques by using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and use FRAP to identify a plaque accretion defect as the primary manifestation of myosin VI loss in Cx43 homeostasis.

The increased production of MG have negative influence over the structure and function of different biomolecules and thus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiac complications. Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, has a major role in preventing cardiac remodeling and ventricular fibrosis. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine whether rats administered with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) could attenuate MG induced pathological effects. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 rats were kept as control; Group 2 rats were administrated with MG (75\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 8\u00a0weeks. Group 3 rats were given RA (Orally, 1.0\u00a0mg/kg/day) along with MG; Group 4 rats received RA alone. Cardiac antioxidant status, induction of fibrosis, AGE receptor (RAGE) and cytokines expression was evaluated in the heart tissues. Administration of MG led to depletion of antioxidant enzymes, induction of fibrosis (p\u2009<\u20090.001), up-regulated expression of RAGE (3.5 fold), TGF-\u03b2 (4.4 fold), SMAD2 (3.7 fold), SMAD3 (6.0 fold), IL-6 (4.3 fold) and TNF-\u03b1 (5.5 fold) in the heart tissues compared to control rats. Moreover, the exogenous administration of MG caused significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) increase in the circulating CML levels. Whereas, RA treatment prevented the induction of fibrosis and restored the levels of cytokines and RAGE expression. Methylglyoxal-induced fibrosis can lead to pathological effects in the heart tissues. RA attenuates the effects of MG in the heart, suggesting that it can be of added value to usual diabetic therapy.", "journal": "Glycoconjugate journal", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["UmadeviSubramanian", "DevipriyaNagarajan"], "doi": "10.1007/s10719-016-9760-5"}

In this study we described a novel mechanism through which interleukin (IL)-6 mediates the regulation of NO release induced in response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Using a murine model of Chagas disease, we found that, in contrast to C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice, IL-6-deficient (IL6KO) mice exhibited a dramatic increase in plasma NO levels concomitant with a significantly higher amount of circulating IL-1\u03b2 and inflammatory monocytes. Studies on mouse macrophages and human monocytes, revealed that IL-6 decreased LPS-induced NO production but this effect was abrogated in the presence of anti-IL-1\u03b2 and in macrophages deficient in the NLRP3 inflammasome. In accordance, while infected WT myocardium exhibited an early shift from microbicidal/M1 to anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophage phenotype, IL6KO cardiac tissue never displayed a dominant M2 macrophage profile that correlated with decreased expression of ATP metabolic machinery and a lower cardiac parasite burden. The deleterious effects of high NO production-induced oxidative stress were evidenced by enhanced cardiac malondialdehyde levels, myocardial cell death and mortality. The survival rate was improved by the treatment of IL-6-deficient mice with a NO production-specific inhibitor. Our data revealed that IL-6 regulates the excessive release of NO through IL-1\u03b2 inhibition and determines the establishment of an M2 macrophage profile within infected heart tissue.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Thus, our goal was to examine the acute effects of CX following its cutaneous exposure in SKH-1 hairless mice to help establish a relevant injury model. Results from our study show that topical cutaneous exposure to CX vapor causes blanching of exposed skin with an erythematous ring, necrosis, edema, mild urticaria and erythema within minutes after exposure out to 8h post-exposure. These clinical skin manifestations were accompanied with increases in skin thickness, apoptotic cell death, mast cell degranulation, myeloperoxidase activity indicating neutrophil infiltration, p53 phosphorylation and accumulation, and an increase in COX-2 and TNF\u03b1 levels. Topical CX-exposure also resulted in the dilatation of the peripheral vessels with a robust increase in RBCs in vessels of the liver, spleen, kidney, lungs and heart tissues.

{"title": "Factors enhancing the migration and the homing of mesenchymal stem cells in experimentally induced cardiotoxicity in rats.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an effective anti-neoplastic drug but its use is limited by its cardiotoxicity. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the management of cardiotoxicity was with poor myocardial homing capacity. With the aim of developing novel techniques to improve the migration of MSCs, we tested whether valproate and electric fields (EFs) direct the migration of MSCs towards the damaged myocardium. The study included five groups of female albino rats. The first group included 10 healthy rats as normal control group. The remaining 40 female rats received doxorubicin for induction of acute cardiotoxicity. Four rats were sacrificed for histopathological confirmation of cardiotoxicity. The remaining rats were equally divided into subsequent four groups. The second group included nine rats that did not receive further treatment (positive control group). The third group included nine rats which received intravenous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) after cardiotoxicity induction. The fourth group included nine rats which received BM-MSCs plus sodium valporate after cardiotoxicity induction. The fifth group included nine rats which received BM-MSCs plus sodium valporate after cardiotoxicity induction and were exposed to an electrical stimulation (ES). Blood samples were taken from all groups at the end of the study to estimate creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), aspartate transaminase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Heart tissues from all rats were used for RNA extraction for assessment of sry gene expression. Homing was tested by PKH26 fluorescence in myocardial tissue sections and by sry gene expression. The best biochemical and histopathological improvement in cardiotoxicity was demonstrated in group 5 (rats that received ES and valporate with MSCs). We concluded that EFs and sodium valproate enhance homing ability of MSCs towards the damaged myocardium in doxorubicin induced carditoxicity model. \u00a9 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(3):162-169, 2017.", "journal": "IUBMB life", "date": "2017-01-14", "authors": ["NabilA Soliman", "Somia HAbd-Allah", "SamiaHussein", "MuhammadAlaa Eldeen"], "doi": "10.1002/iub.1600"}

{"title": "Developmental programming: Interaction between prenatal BPA and postnatal overfeeding on cardiac tissue gene expression in female sheep.", "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies and studies in rodents point to potential risks from developmental exposure to BPA on cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the manifestation and severity of adverse outcomes is the result of interaction between developmental insults and the prevailing environment. Consistent with this premise, recent studies in sheep found prenatal BPA treatment prevented the adverse effects of postnatal obesity in inducing hypertension. The gene networks underlying these complex interactions are not known. mRNA-seq of myocardium was performed on four groups of four female sheep to assess the effects of prenatal BPA exposure, postnatal overfeeding and their interaction on gene transcription, pathway perturbations and functional effects. The effects of prenatal exposure to BPA, postnatal overfeeding, and prenatal BPA with postnatal overfeeding all resulted in transcriptional changes (85-141 significant differentially expressed genes). Although the effects of prenatal BPA and postnatal overfeeding did not involve dysregulation of many of the same genes, they affected a remarkably similar set of biological pathways. Furthermore, an additive or synergistic effect was not found in the combined treatment group, but rather prenatal BPA treatment led to a partial reversal of the effects of overfeeding alone. Many genes previously known to be affected by BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, EGR1, and EGFR were key hubs affected by BPA and/or overfeeding.

The present study was aimed to investigate the expression of CTSL and CTSB in animal model of doxorubicin (doxo)-induced cardiomyopathy as well as in peripheral blood samples of DCM patients. Cardiac tissue sections from doxo-treated and control rats were used to study the expression of CTSL and CTSB by enzyme assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Whether reperfusion therapy with recombinant human relaxin-2, serelaxin, reduces myocardial infarct size and attenuates the subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to further loss of functional myocardium following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is unknown.\nAfter baseline echocardiography, adult male wild-type C57BL or eNOS knockout mice underwent myocardial infarction (MI) by coronary artery ligation for 30\u2009min followed by 24\u2009h reperfusion. Mice were treated with either serelaxin (10 \u00b5g/kg; sc) or saline 1\u2009h prior to ischemia or 5\u2009min before reperfusion.

Cells undergoing transdifferentiation expressed ACTN2 and TNNT2 and partially organized their cytoskeleton in a cross-striated manner. The conversion process was associated with significant upregulation of a cohort of cardiac-specific genes, activation of pathways associated with muscle contraction and physiology, and downregulation of fibroblastic markers. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator and readily detected active calcium transients although no spontaneous contractions were observed in transdifferentiated cells. Finally, we determined that inhibition of Janus kinase 1, inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase 3, or addition of NRG1 significantly enhanced the efficiency of transdifferentiation.

{"title": "Barth Syndrome: Connecting Cardiolipin to Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "The Barth syndrome (BTHS) is caused by an inborn error of metabolism that manifests characteristic phenotypic features including altered mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, lactic acidosis, organic acid-uria, skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The underlying cause of BTHS has been definitively traced to mutations in the tafazzin (TAZ) gene locus on chromosome X. TAZ encodes a phospholipid transacylase that promotes cardiolipin acyl chain remodeling. Absence of tafazzin activity results in cardiolipin molecular species heterogeneity, increased levels of monolysocardiolipin and lower cardiolipin abundance. In skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue mitochondria these alterations in cardiolipin perturb the inner membrane, compromising electron transport chain function and aerobic respiration. Decreased electron flow from fuel metabolism via NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity leads to a buildup of NADH in the matrix space and product inhibition of key TCA cycle enzymes. As TCA cycle activity slows pyruvate generated by glycolysis is diverted to lactic acid. In turn, Cori cycle activity increases to supply muscle with glucose for continued ATP production. Acetyl CoA that is unable to enter the TCA cycle is diverted to organic acid waste products that are excreted in urine. Overall, reduced ATP production efficiency in BTHS is exacerbated under conditions of increased energy demand. Prolonged deficiency in ATP production capacity underlies cell and tissue pathology that ultimately is manifest as dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Lipids", "date": "2017-01-11", "authors": ["NikitaIkon", "Robert ORyan"], "doi": "10.1007/s11745-016-4229-7"}

Rutin as a polyphenolic flavonoid has been illustrated to protect hearts from diverse cardiovascular diseases. Its function is known to be related to its antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity which may regulate multiple cellular signal pathways. However, the role of rutin on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity has yet to be discovered. In this study, we explored the protective role of rutin on doxorubicin-induced heart failure and elucidated the potential mechanisms of protective effects of rutin against cardiomyocyte death. We analyzed cardiac tissues at the time point of 8weeks after doxorubicin treatment. The results by echocardiography, TUNEL staining, Masson's trichrome staining as well as Western blot analysis revealed that doxorubicin induced remarkable cardiac dysfunction and cardiotoxicity in mice hearts and cardiomyocytes, which were alleviated by rutin treatment. Western blot analysis indicated that the underlying mechanisms included inhibition excessive autophagy and apoptosis mediated by Akt activation. Collectively, our findings suggest that suppression of autophagy and apoptosis by administration of rutin could attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, which enhances our knowledge to explore new drugs and strategies for combating this devastating side effect induced by doxorubicin.

We investigated the profile of two angiomiRs, miR-126, and miR-132, in the plasma of type 2 diabetic individuals without any known history of CVD as well as in the cardiac tissues collected from diabetics undergoing cardiac surgery.\nThe presence of diabetes alone significantly decreased both angiomiRs in the plasma and the myocardium. The down-regulation of angiomiRs was also associated with reduced capillaries and arterioles and increased endothelial cell apoptosis, the hallmark of microangiopathy. Importantly, a time course study in a type 2 diabetic mouse model confirmed that the down-regulation of angiomiRs preceded endothelial apoptosis as well as alterations in the density of the microvasculature. Finally, therapeutic overexpression of both angiomiRs in diabetic aortic rings and human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to high glucose (HG) abrogated the deleterious effects of diabetes and HG on cell survival and proliferation and restored their angiogenic potential.\nThese novel findings demonstrate that the down-regulation of angiomiRs is a major underlying mechanism for the development of microangiopathy in diabetic hearts.

This study aims to investigate the drug tissue distribution and the driving force for tissue distribution from doxorubicin solution and two liposomal delivery systems, Doxil and Myocet. These three formulations were intravenously administered to mice at a single dose of 5mg/kg. Eleven organs, plasma and blood were collected at different time points. Total doxorubicin concentrations in each specimen were measured with LC-MS/MS. Compared to doxorubicin solution, both Doxil and Myocet produced distinct doxorubicin tissue exposure in all 11 tissues. Interestingly, the tissue exposure by Myocet was drastically different from that of Doxil and showed a formulation-dependent pattern. Cmax of doxorubicin in heart tissue by Doxil and Myocet was approximately 60% and 50% respectively of that by doxorubicin solution. The predominant driving force for doxorubicin tissue distribution is liposomal-doxorubicin deposition for Doxil and free drug concentration for doxorubicin solution. For Myocet, the driving force for tissue distribution is predominately liposomal-doxorubicin deposition into tissues within the first 4h; as the non-PEGylated doxorubicin liposomal decomposes, the driving force for tissue distribution is gradually switched to the released free doxorubicin.

Isolated right and left atria and small mesenteric arteries from wild type and tau deficient (KO) mice of two age groups (13 and 23 months old) were used to assess cardiovascular phenotypes. Tau KO mice showed an increased systolic blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy at 13 months, which was accompanied by a significantly lower right atrial rate and a subtle decrease in the maximum contractility to calcium, isoprenaline, and electrical sympathetic nerve stimulation. Aging tau KO mice to 23 months resulted in cardiac hypertrophy with significantly attenuated left atrial contractility, increased blood pressure, and sensitivity of isolated mesenteric arteries to angiotensin II contraction and isoprenaline relaxation compared to their younger counterparts.

However, the bioactivity of biomaterials remains to be optimized because currently available biomaterials do not mimic the biochemical components as well as the structural properties of native myocardial extracellular matrix. Here we hypothesized that human heart valve-derived scaffold (hHVS), as a clinically relevant novel biomaterial, may provide the proper microenvironment of native myocardial extracellular matrix for cardiac repair. In this study, human heart valve tissue was sliced into 100\u2009\u03bcm tissue sheet by frozen-sectioning and then decellularized to form the hHVS. Upon anchoring onto the hHVS, post-infarct murine BM c-kit+ cells exhibited an increased capacity for proliferation and cardiomyogenic differentiation in vitro. When used to patch infarcted heart in a murine model of myocardial infarction, either implantation of the hHVS alone or c-kit+ cell-seeded hHVS significantly improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size; while c-kit+ cell-seeded hHVS was even superior to the hHVS alone. Thus, we have successfully developed a hHVS for cardiac repair.

{"title": "Trimethylamine N-oxide impairs pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation in cardiac mitochondria.", "abstract": "Increased plasma concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic metabolite, has been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, it remains unclear whether TMAO is a biomarker or whether it induces direct detrimental cardiovascular effects. Because altered cardiac energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction play crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases, we hypothesized that increased TMAO concentration may alter mitochondrial energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of TMAO on cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism. Acute exposure of cardiac fibers to TMAO decreased LEAK (substrate-dependent) and OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation-dependent) mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate and impaired substrate flux via pyruvate dehydrogenase. The administration of TMAO at a dose of 120mg/kg for 8 weeks increased TMAO concentration in plasma and cardiac tissues 22-23 times to about 15\u03bcM and 11nmol/g, respectively. Long-term TMAO administration decreased mitochondrial LEAK state respiration with pyruvate by 30% without affecting OXPHOS state respiration. However, no significant changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production were observed after acute exposure of cardiac fibers to TMAO under physiological conditions. In addition, both long-term TMAO administration and acute exposure to TMAO decreased respiration with palmitoyl-CoA indicating impaired \u03b2-oxidation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that increased TMAO concentration impairs pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation in cardiac mitochondria. Thus, the accumulation of TMAO in cardiac tissues leads to disturbances in energy metabolism that can increase the severity of cardiovascular events.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2017-01-04", "authors": ["MarinaMakrecka-Kuka", "KristineVolska", "UnigundeAntone", "ReinisVilskersts", "SolveigaGrinberga", "DaceBandere", "EdgarsLiepinsh", "MaijaDambrova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2016.12.017"}

The administration of pyridoxal-5-phosphate as cofactor of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes restored endogenous H(2)S level and redox state in the heart and aorta tissues. Under these conditions, the following indicators of oxidative stress were significantly decreased in heart and aorta tissues: superoxide generation rate (\u00b70(2)(-)) and hydroxyl (\u00b7OH) anion radicals, compared with significantly elevated levels of these parameters in old animals. We also found the reduction of non-enzymatic (diene conjugates and malonic dialdehyde) and enzymatic (uric acid, LTC(4) and TxB(2)) lipid oxidation products levels in old rats under H(2)S synthesis stimulation that confirms the restriction of oxidative stress. An important consequence of endogenous synthesis stimulation of hydrogen sulfide during aging is a decrease of nitrozative stress, such as iNOS activity and nitrate reductase, as well as recovery of constitutive NO synthase activity, indicating the importance of this gas transmitter in cardiovascular system. Thus, stimulation of hydrogen sulfide endogenous synthesis contributed to reduced production of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress) and nitrogen (nitrozative stress) in heart and aorta tissues with aging.

Moreover, CDDP induced an increase in the level of hepatic and cardiac injury biomarkers, decreases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, a decrease in GSH concentration, and an increase in MDA concentration. CDDP also induced histopathological hepatocellular and myocardial changes, and overexpression of p53 and COX-2 in hepatic and cardiac tissues. Administration of PO either as a preventative medicine or as treatment significantly improved all the observed deleterious effects induced by CDDP in rat liver and heart. Thus, it may be concluded that PO, with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities, can potentially be used in the treatment of CDDP-induced hepatic and cardiac injuries.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2016-12-26", "authors": ["Suhair AAbdellatief", "Azza A AGalal", "Sameh MFarouk", "Mohamed MAbdel-Daim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2016.12.038"}

In reaction-diffusion models of cardiac tissue, heterogeneities in action potential duration (APD) can be created by locally modifying an intrinsic membrane kinetics parameter. Electrotonic coupling, however, acts as a confounding factor that modulates APD dispersion.\nWe developed an algorithm based on a quasi-Newton method that iteratively adjusts the spatial distribution of a membrane parameter to reproduce a pre-defined target APD map in a coupled tissue. The method assumes that the relation between the adjustable parameter and APD is bijective in an isolated cell. Each iteration of the algorithm involved simulating the cardiac reaction-diffusion system with the updated parameter profile for one beat and extracting the APD map. The algorithm was extended to simultaneous estimation of two parameter profiles based on two APD maps at different repolarization thresholds.\nThe method was validated in 1D, 2D and 3D atrial tissues using synthetic target APD maps with controllable total variation and maximum APD gradient. The adjustable parameter was local acetylcholine concentration. The iterations converged provided that APD gradients were not too steep. Convergence was found to be faster 2-5 iterations) when the maximal gradient was less steep, when APD range was smaller and when tissue conductivity was reduced.\nThis algorithm provides a tool to automatically generate arrhythmogenic substrates with controllable repolarization gradients and possibly incorporate experimental APD maps into computer models.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2016-12-25", "authors": ["Akshay KotaAswath Kumar", "AngelinaDrahi", "VincentJacquemet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.12.008"}

The mechanisms implicated in the development of diabetic heart disease, commonly termed diabetic cardiomyopathy, are complex, but much of the impact of diabetes on the heart can be attributed to impaired glucose handling. It has been shown that the maladaptive nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) contributes to diabetic complications in many non-cardiac tissues. Glucose metabolism by the HBP leads to enzymatically-regulated, O-linked attachment of a sugar moiety molecule, \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), to proteins, affecting their biological activity (similar to phosphorylation). In normal physiology, transient activation of HBP/O-GlcNAc mechanisms is an adaptive, protective means to enhance cell survival; interventions that acutely suppress this pathway decrease tolerance to stress. Conversely, chronic dysregulation of HBP/O-GlcNAc mechanisms has been shown to be detrimental in certain pathological settings, including diabetes and cancer. Most of our understanding of the impact of sustained maladaptive HBP and O-GlcNAc protein modifications has been derived from adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and other non-cardiac tissues, as a contributing mechanism to insulin resistance and progression of diabetic complications. However, the long-term consequences of persistent activation of cardiac HBP and O-GlcNAc are not well-understood; therefore, the goal of this timely review is to highlight current understanding of the role of the HBP pathway in development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2016-12-19", "authors": ["Cheng XueQin", "RochelleSleaby", "Amy JDavidoff", "James RBell", "Miles JDe Blasio", "Leanne MDelbridge", "John CChatham", "Rebecca HRitchie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2016.12.016"}

Biomaterials comprising such scaffolds should mimic the cardiac tissue in terms of composition, structure, mechanical support, and most importantly, bioactivity. Nonetheless, natural biomaterial-based gels may suffer from limited mechanical strength, which often fail to provide the long-term support required by the heart for contraction and relaxation.

Most importantly, their application in treating acute and long term chronic MI in rat models clearly demonstrates the significant therapeutic potential of these gels in the long-term (12weeks post MI).

Local hypoxia is well-defined stimulus to the production of angiogenesis mediators. Assuming that different genetic T. cruzi populations induce distinct inflammation and disease patterns, the current study aims to investigate whether the production of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators is a parasite strain-dependent condition. C57BL/6 mice were infected with the Y and Colombian strains of T. cruzi and euthanized at the 12th and 32nd days, respectively. The blood and heart tissue were processed in immune assays and/or qPCR (TNF, IL-17, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCR2, CCR5 and angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2) and in histological assays. The T. cruzi increased the inflammatory and angiogenic mediators in the infected mice when they were compared to non-infected animals. However, the Colombian strain has led to higher (i) leukocyte infiltration, (ii) cardiac TNF and CCL5 production/expression, (iii) cardiac tissue parasitism, and to higher (iv) ratio between heart/body weights. On the other hand, the Colombian strain has caused lower production and expression VEGF, Ang-1 and Ang-2, when it was compared to the Y strain of the parasite.

{"title": "A collagen cardiac patch incorporating alginate microparticles permits the controlled release of hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 to enhance cardiac stem cell migration and proliferation.", "abstract": "Cardiac stem cells (CSCs) represent a logical cell type to exploit as a regenerative treatment option for tissue damage accrued as a result of a myocardial infarction. However, the isolation and expansion of CSCs prior to cell transplantation is time consuming, costly and invasive, and the reliability of cell expansion may also prove to be a major obstacle in the clinical application of CSC-based transplantation therapy after a myocardial infarction. In order to overcome this, we propose the incorporation of growth factor-eluting alginate microparticles into collagen-based scaffolds as an implantable biomaterial to promote the recruitment and expansion of CSCs in the myocardium. In order to obtain scaffolds able to enhance the motogenic and proliferative potential of CSCs, the aim of this work was to achieve a sustained delivery of both hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1. Both proteins were initially encapsulated in alginate microparticles by spray drying and subsequently incorporated into a collagen scaffold. Microparticles were seen to homogeneously distribute through the interconnected scaffold pore structure. The resulting scaffolds were capable of extending the release of both proteins up to 15\u00a0days, a three-fold increase over non-encapsulated proteins embedded in the scaffolds. In vitro assays with isolated CSCs demonstrated that the sustained release of both bioactive proteins resulted in an increased motogenic and proliferative effect. As presently practiced, the isolation and expansion of CSCs for autologous cell transplantation is slow, expensive and difficult to attain. Thus, there is a need for strategies to specifically activate in situ the intrinsic cardiac regenerative potential represented by the CSCs using combinations of growth factors obviating the need for cell transplantation. By favouring the natural regenerative capability of CSCs, it is hypothesized that the cardiac patch presented here will result in positive therapeutic outcomes in MI and heart failure patients in the future.

Given the flexibility, electrical conductance, and contractility of native cardiac tissues, it is desirable that polymeric scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration exhibit elasticity and high electrical conductivity. Herein, we developed a facile approach to introduce carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylate) (124 polymer), and developed an elastomeric scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering that provides electrical conductivity and structural integrity to 124 polymer. 124 polymer-CNT materials were developed by first dispersing CNTs in poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether porogen and mixing with 124 prepolymer for molding into shapes and crosslinking under ultraviolet light. 124 polymers with 0.5% and 0.1% CNT content (wt) exhibited improved conductivity against pristine 124 polymer. With increasing the CNT content, surface moduli of hybrid polymers were increased, while their bulk moduli were decreased. Furthermore, increased swelling of hybrid 124 polymer-CNT materials was observed, suggesting their improved structural support in an aqueous environment. Finally, functional characterization of engineered cardiac tissues using the 124 polymer-CNT scaffolds demonstrated improved excitation threshold in materials with 0.5% CNT content (3.6\u00b10.8V/cm) compared to materials with 0% (5.1\u00b10.8V/cm) and 0.1% (5.0\u00b10.7V/cm), suggesting greater tissue maturity. 124 polymer-CNT materials build on the advantages of 124 polymer elastomer to give a versatile biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering applications.\nAchieving a high elasticity and a high conductivity in a single cardiac tissue engineering material remains a challenge. We report the use of CNTs in making electrically conductive and mechanically strong polymeric scaffolds in cardiac tissue regeneration. CNTs were incorporated in elastomeric polymers in a facile and reproducible approach. Polymer-CNT materials were able to construct complicated scaffold structures by injecting the prepolymer into a mold and crosslinking the prepolymer under ultraviolet light. CNTs enhanced electrical conductivity and structural support of elastomeric polymers. Hybrid polymeric scaffolds containing 0.5wt% CNTs increased the maturation of cardiac tissues fabricated on them compared to pure polymeric scaffolds. The cardiac tissues on hybrid polymer-CNT scaffolds showed earlier beating than those on pure polymer scaffolds.

Here we propose poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone) and fibroblast-derived ECM (PLCL/FDM), a hybrid scaffold that combines aligned electrospun PLCL fibers and FDM. Fibroblasts were grown on the PLCL fibers for 5-7 days and subsequently decellularized to produce PLCL/FDM. Various analyses confirmed aligned, FDM-deposited PLCL fibers. Compared to fibronectin (FN)-coated electrospun PLCL fibers (control), H9c2 cardiomyoblast differentiation was significantly effective, and neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (CM) phenotype and maturation was improved on PLCL/FDM. Moreover, a coculture platform was created using multilayer PLCL/FDM in which two different cells make indirect or direct cell-cell contacts. Such coculture platforms demonstrate their feasibility in terms of higher cell viability, efficiency of target cell harvest (>95% in noncontact; 85% in contact mode), and molecular diffusion through the PLCL/FDM layer. Coculture of primary CMs and fibroblasts exhibited much better CM phenotype and improvement of CM maturity upon either direct or indirect interactions, compared to the conventional coculture systems (transwell insert and tissue culture plate (TCP)).

NOX4 is interrelated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) is a key mediator of ERS while its role in cardiac hypertrophy is still poorly understood. Recently, receptor interacting protein kinase 1(RIPK1) has been increasingly reported to be associated with ERS. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Xbp1s mediates NOX4-triggered cardiac hypertrophy via RIPK1 signaling. In the heart tissue of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) rats and in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes(NCMs) treated with angiotensinII(AngII) or isoproterenol (ISO), NOX4 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and expression of Xbp1s as well as RIPK1-related phosphorylation of P65 subunit of NF-\u03baB were elevated. Gene silencing of NOX4 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly blocked the upregulation of NOX4, generation of ROS, splicing of Xbp1 and activation of the RIPK1-related NF-\u03baB signaling, meanwhile attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC) and NOX4 inhibitor GKT137831 reduced ROS generation and alleviated activation of Xbp1 and RIPK1-related NF-\u03baB signaling. Furthermore, splicing of Xbp1 was responsible for the increase in RIPK1 expression in AngII or ISO-treated NCMs. Upregulated RIPK1 in turn activates NF-\u03baB signaling in a kinase activity-independent manner. These findings suggest that Xbp1s plays an important role in NOX4-triggered cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via activating its downstream effector RIPK1, which may prove significant for the development of future therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2016-12-09", "authors": ["LiChen", "MingyueZhao", "JunliLi", "YuWang", "QinxueBao", "SiyuanWu", "XueqinDeng", "XiaojuTang", "WenchaoWu", "XiaojingLiu"], "doi": "10.1080/15384101.2016.1260210\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.013894\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.048.\n10.1089/ars.2009.2625.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.02.002.\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183707.\n10.1097/hjh.0000000000000597.\n10.1038/nrm3270.\n10.1089/dna.2014.2552.\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2015.04.010.\n10.1111/acel.12460\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.01.001\n10.1002/embr.201337970.\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.011195.\n10.1093/cvr/cvu146.\n10.1038/nm.4017.\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1049800.\n10.1038/cddis.2014.523.\n10.1155/2016/1451676.\n10.1073/pnas.1002178107\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.12.018.\n10.1242/jcs.153643.\n10.1128/MCB.01445-09.\n10.15252/embj.201592394.\n10.1128/mcb.24.24.10703-10717.2004.\n10.1161/circresaha.112.279760.\n10.1161/01.res.0000099504.30207.f5.\n10.1016/j.cjca.2013.04.026.\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.011079.\n10.1161/circresaha.109.213116.\n10.1161/01.RES.0000233317.70421.03\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.014.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.12.018.\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.021.\n10.1053/j.gastro.2011.06.045.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.11.006.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0107135."}

Over the past two decades, various stem cell based approaches have been shown to improve left ventricular function in pre-clinical animal models. Promising results rapidly led to clinical trials, initially using bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, then mesenchymal stromal cell populations and, more recently, progenitor cells from the adult heart itself. These have been shown to be safe and have advanced our understanding of potential suitable recipients, cell delivery routes, and possible mechanisms of action. However, efficacy in these trials has been inconsistent. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are another potential source of stem cells for cardiac regeneration.

The study registered 50 adult male rats which were divided into five groups in equal numbers as follows: group 1, normal control; group 2, sham; group 3, myocardial ischemia reperfusion (My/IR): the group which was fed on a normal diet and in which myocardial I/R was induced; group 4, myocardial ischemia reperfusion + chronic zinc: (5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0i.p. zinc sulfate for 15\u00a0days); and group 5, myocardial ischemia reperfusion + acute zinc: the group which was administered 15\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0i.p. zinc sulfate an hour before the operation and in which myocardial I/R was induced. The collected blood and cardiac tissue samples were analyzed using spectrophotometric method to determine levels of MDA, as an indicator of tissue injury, and GSH, as an indicator of antioxidant activity. The highest plasma and heart tissue MDA levels were measured in group 3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Group 5 had lower MDA values than group 3, while group 4 had significantly lower MDA values than groups 3 and 5 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In the pathology of MI, enzymes released due to the mitochondrial and lysosomal lipid peroxidation play an integral role. Induction of rats with ISO (85mg/kg BW) for 2 consecutive days resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of heart mitochondrial enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-KGDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The activities of lysosomal enzymes (\u03b2- glucosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, cathepsin-B and cathepsin-D) were increased significantly in the heart tissue. A prominent expression of LDH 1 and LDH 2 isoenzymes in the serum were observed and changes in the Electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns were also recorded in the ISO-induced rats. The prior administrations of CGA (40mg/kg BW) for 19days markedly ameliorated ISO induced alterations in ECG and significantly restored the activities of all the above enzymes in the heart of ISO-induced rats, which substantiates the stress stabilizing action of CGA. Oral administration of CGA (40mg/kg BW) to normal rats did not show any significant changes. These biochemical functional alterations were supported by the histology of heart (Massion's trichrome and Picrosirius red staining for collagen formation). Thereupon, this study shows that 40mg/kg BW of CGA gives protection against ISO-induced MI and demonstrates that CGA has a significant effect in the protection of heart.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["PalaniyandiAkila", "LourthuraniAsaikumar", "LakshmananVennila"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2016.11.067"}

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks of SCN5A, we surveyed the promoter and first intronic regions of the SCN5A gene, predicting the presence of several binding sites for GATA transcription factors (TFs). Consistent with this prediction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP) assays show co-occupancy of cardiac GATA TFs GATA4 and GATA5 on promoter and intron 1 SCN5A regions in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples. Gene reporter experiments show GATA4 and GATA5 synergism in the activation of the SCN5A promoter, and its dependence on predicted GATA binding sites. GATA4 and GATA6 mRNAs are robustly expressed in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples as measured by highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). GATA5 mRNA is marginally but still clearly detected in the same samples. Importantly, GATA4 mRNA levels are strongly and positively correlated with SCN5A transcript levels in the human heart. Together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of GATA TFs in the regulation of the SCN5A gene in human heart tissue. Our studies suggest that GATA5 but especially GATA4 are main contributors to SCN5A gene expression, thus providing a new paradigm of SCN5A expression regulation that may shed new light into the understanding of cardiac disease.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2016-11-30", "authors": ["AnnaTarradas", "Mel LinaPinsach-Abuin", "CarlosMackintosh", "OriolLlor\u00e0-Batlle", "AlexandraP\u00e9rez-Serra", "MontserratBatlle", "F\u00e9lixP\u00e9rez-Villa", "ThomasZimmer", "IvanGarcia-Bassets", "RamonBrugada", "PedroBeltran-Alvarez", "SaraPagans"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.10.013"}

NRG1 and FGF1 have become promising therapeutic agents to treat myocardial infarction (MI) disorder. Unfortunately, clinical trials performed so far reported negative efficacy results, because growth factors are rapidly degraded and eliminated from the biological tissues once administered. In order to increase their bioavailability and favour their therapeutic effects, they have been combined with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyethylene glycol microparticles (PLGA MPs and PEG-PLGA MPs). Here we compare both types of microparticles loaded with NRG1 or FGF1 in terms of efficacy in a rat MI model. Our results showed that intramyocardial injection of NRG1 or FGF1-loaded PLGA and PEG-PLGA MPs brought about similar improvements in the ejection fraction, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis after administration into the infarcted hearts. PEG coating did not add any effect regarding MP efficacy. Both PLGA and PEG-PLGA MPs were equally phagocyted in the heart.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate if early acute and following age stages of myocardial infarction can be detected and discerned by quantitative 1.5T post-mortem cardiac magnetic resonance (PMCMR) based on quantitative T1, T2 and PD values. In 80 deceased individuals (25 female, 55 male), a cardiac MR quantification sequence was performed prior to cardiac dissection at autopsy in a prospective study. Focal myocardial signal alterations detected in synthetically generated MR images were MR quantified for their T1, T2 and PD values. The locations of signal alteration measurements in PMCMR were targeted at autopsy heart dissection and cardiac tissue specimens were taken for histologic examinations. Quantified signal alterations in PMCMR were correlated to their according histologic age stage of myocardial infarction. In PMCMR seventy-three focal myocardial signal alterations were detected in 49 of 80 investigated hearts. These signal alterations were diagnosed histologically as early acute (n=39), acute (n=14), subacute (n=10) and chronic (n=10) age stages of myocardial infarction.

The current paradigm in medicine seeks novel approaches for the treatment of progressive or end-stage diseases. The organ transplantation option is limited in availability, and unfortunately, a significant number of patients are lost while waiting for donor organs. Animal studies have shown that upon myocardial infarction, it is possible to stop adverse remodeling in its tracks and reverse with tissue engineering methods. Regaining the myocardium function and avoiding further deterioration towards heart failure can benefit millions of people with a significantly lesser burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells brings the unique advantage of testing candidate drug molecules on organ-on-chip systems, which mimics human heart in vitro. Biomimetic three-dimensional constructs that contain disease-specific or normal cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells are a useful tool for screening drug molecules and studying dosage, mode of action and cardio-toxicity. Tissue engineering approach aims to develop the treatments for heart valve deficiency, ischemic heart disease and a wide range of vascular diseases. Translational research seeks to improve the patient's quality of life, progressing towards developing cures, rather than treatments. To this end, researchers are working on tissue engineered heart valves, blood vessels, cardiac patches, and injectable biomaterials, hence developing new ways for engineering bio-artificial organs or tissue parts that the body will adopt as its own.

Embedding cells into 3D biodegradable scaffolds may better preserve cell survival and enhance cell engraftment after transplantation, consequently improving cardiac cell therapy compared with direct intramyocardial injection of isolated cells. The primary objective of a scaffold used in tissue engineering is the recreation of the natural 3D environment most suitable for an adequate tissue growth. An important aspect of this commitment is to mimic the fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix, which provides essential guidance for cell organization, survival, and function. Recent advances in nanotechnology have significantly improved our capacities to mimic the extracellular matrix. Among them, electrospinning is well known for being easy to process and cost effective. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly popular for biomedical applications and it is most definitely the cutting edge technique to make scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix for industrial applications.

{"title": "I-Wire Heart-on-a-Chip I: Three-dimensional cardiac tissue constructs for physiology and pharmacology.", "abstract": "Engineered 3D cardiac tissue constructs (ECTCs) can replicate complex cardiac physiology under normal and pathological conditions. Currently, most measurements of ECTC contractility are either made isometrically, with fixed length and without control of the applied force, or auxotonically against a variable force, with the length changing during the contraction. The \"I-Wire\" platform addresses the unmet need to control the force applied to ECTCs while interrogating their passive and active mechanical and electrical characteristics. A six-well plate with inserted PDMS casting molds containing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured with fibrin for 13-15days is mounted on the motorized mechanical stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a fast sCMOS camera. A calibrated flexible probe provides strain load of the ECTC via lateral displacement, and the microscope detects the deflections of both the probe and the ECTC. The ECTCs exhibited longitudinally aligned cardiomyocytes with well-developed sarcomeric structure, recapitulated the Frank-Starling force-tension relationship, and demonstrated expected transmembrane action potentials, electrical and mechanical restitutions, and responses to both \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and blebbistatin. The I-Wire platform enables creation and mechanical and electrical characterization of ECTCs, and hence can be valuable in the study of cardiac diseases, drug screening, drug development, and the qualification of cells for tissue-engineered regenerative medicine.\nThere is a growing interest in creating engineered heart tissue constructs for basic cardiac research, applied research in cardiac pharmacology, and repair of damaged hearts. We address an unmet need to characterize fully the performance of these tissues with our simple \"I-Wire\" assay that allows application of controlled forces to three-dimensional cardiac fiber constructs and measurement of both the electrical and mechanical properties of the construct. The advantage of I-Wire over other approaches is that the constructs being measured are truly three-dimensional, rather than a single layer of cells grown within a microfluidic device.

The I-Wire engineered cardiac tissue construct (ECTC) is a novel experimental platform to investigate cardiac cell mechanics during auxotonic contraction. Whereas passive biomaterials often exhibit nonlinear and dissipative behavior, active tissue equivalents, such as ECTCs, also expend metabolic energy to perform mechanical work that presents additional challenges in quantifying their properties. The I-Wire model uses the passive mechanical response to increasing applied tension to measure the inherent stress and resistance to stretch of the construct before, during, and after treatments. Both blebbistatin and isoproterenol reduced prestress and construct stiffness; however, blebbistatin treatment abolished subsequent force-generating potential while isoproterenol enhanced this property. We demonstrate that the described model can replicate the response of these constructs to intrinsic changes in force-generating potential in response to both increasing frequency of stimulation and decreasing starting length. This analysis provides a useful mathematical model of the I-Wire platform, increases the number of parameters that can be derived from the device, and serves as a demonstration of quantitative characterization of nonlinear, active biomaterials. We anticipate that this quantitative analysis of I-Wire constructs will prove useful for qualifying patient-specific cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts prior to their utilization for cardiac regenerative medicine.\nPassive biomaterials may have non-linear elasticity and losses, but engineered muscle tissue also exhibits time- and force-dependent contractions. Historically, mathematical muscle models include series-elastic, parallel-elastic, contractile, and viscous elements. While hearts-on-a-chip can demonstrate in vitro the contractile properties of engineered cardiac constructs and their response to drugs, most of these use cellular monolayers that cannot be readily probed with controlled forces. The I-Wire platform described in the preceding paper by Sidorov et al. addresses these limitations with three-dimensional tissue constructs to which controlled forces can be applied. In this companion paper, we show how to characterize I-Wire constructs using a non-linear, active Hill model, which should be useful for qualifying cells prior to their use in cardiac regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-11-08", "authors": ["Alison KSchroer", "Matthew SShotwell", "Veniamin YSidorov", "John PWikswo", "W DavidMerryman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.010\n10.1007/s10741-016-9528-9"}

Genistein treatment also resulted in significant improvement in the stenosis of pulmonary artery, proliferation of smooth muscle, right ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial hypertrophy. These therapeutic effects were more obvious with increasing dose of genistein. After genistein treatment, amelioration in survival rates of PAH rats was observed. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could block these therapeutic effects. In rat lung tissue, P-Akt, P-eNOS and NO expressions were increased significantly in genistein treatment group when compared with PAH group (p<0.05, respectively).

Significant arrhythmias developed during six (18%) ablations. Cardiac tissue injury occurred with 17 ablations (50%). Risk of arrhythmia and tissue injury decreased with increasing antenna distance from the heart with both antenna orientations. No cardiac complication occurred with a distance of greater than or equal to 4.4 mm from the heart. The ablation zone extended to the pleural surface adjacent to the heart in 71% of parallel and 17% of perpendicular ablations performed 5-10 mm from the heart. Conclusion Microwave lung ablations performed more than or equal to 5 mm from the heart were associated with a low risk of cardiac complications.

Three unrelated male patients aged 34 to 52\u00a0years with cardiomyopathy and abnormal glycogen storage on endomyocardial biopsy were homozygous for the missense mutation p.Asp102His in GYG1. The mutated glycogenin-1 protein was expressed in cardiac tissue but had lost its ability to autoglucosylate as demonstrated by an in vitro assay and western blot analysis. It was therefore unable to form the primer for normal glycogen synthesis. Two of the patients showed similar patterns of heart dilatation, reduced ejection fraction and extensive late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. These two patients were severely affected, necessitating cardiac transplantation. The cardiomyocyte storage material was characterized by large inclusions of periodic acid and Schiff positive material that was partly resistant to alpha-amylase treatment consistent with polyglucosan. The storage material had, unlike normal glycogen, a partly fibrillar structure by electron microscopy. None of the patients showed signs or symptoms of muscle weakness but a skeletal muscle biopsy in one case revealed muscle fibres with abnormal glycogen storage. Glycogenin-1 deficiency is known as a rare cause of skeletal muscle glycogen storage disease, usually without cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that it may also be the cause of severe cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure without skeletal muscle weakness. GYG1 should be included in cardiomyopathy gene panels.", "journal": "Journal of inherited metabolic disease", "date": "2016-10-09", "authors": ["CarolaHedberg-Oldfors", "EmmaGlamuzina", "PeterRuygrok", "Lisa JAnderson", "PerryElliott", "OliverWatkinson", "ChrisOccleshaw", "MalcolmAbernathy", "ClintonTurner", "NicolaKingston", "ElaineMurphy", "AndersOldfors"], "doi": "10.1007/s10545-016-9978-1\n10.1016/j.nmd.2015.10.012\n10.1056/NEJMoa033349\n10.1038/ni.2457\n10.1093/hmg/ddi062\n10.1074/jbc.273.31.19566\n10.1042/bj3260929u\n10.1212/NXG.0000000000000021\n10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00305-4\n10.1016/j.mam.2015.08.006\n10.1074/jbc.M502344200\n10.1210/jc.2014-4337\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.03.017\n10.1016/j.nmd.2015.07.007\n10.1016/j.jns.2012.01.027\n10.1002/ana.24284\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2008.01.011\n10.1016/S0887-8994(00)00276-9\n10.1006/geno.2000.6152\n10.1002/ana.23598\n10.1056/NEJMoa0900661\n10.1002/ana.23963\n10.1097/WCO.0b013e328364dbdc\n10.1038/84168\n10.1042/BJ20111416\n10.1074/jbc.M111.331611\n10.1074/jbc.273.15.9249\n10.1093/brain/aws205"}

Rats in the fifth and sixth groups received respective Se doses (0.5 or 1\u00a0mg/kg) for 6\u00a0days and then a single dose of CP administered on the sixth day. On day 7, the animals were sacrificed; blood samples were collected to measure malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels. Heart tissues were processed routinely and tissue sections were stained with H\u00a0+\u00a0E for light microscopic examination. In the CP-treated rats MDA, LDH, CK-MB, and IMA serum levels increased, while GSH levels decreased. Microscopic evaluation showed that tissue damage was conspicuously lower in CP plus Se groups.

{"title": "In vivo cardiomyocyte response to YTX- and AZA-1-induced damage: autophagy versus apoptosis.", "abstract": "Yessotoxins (YTX) and azaspiracids (AZAs) are marine toxins produced by phytoplanktonic dinoflagellates that get accumulated in filter feeding shellfish and finally reach human consumers through the food web. Both toxin classes are worldwide distributed, and food safety authorities have regulated their content in shellfish in many countries. Recently, YTXs and AZAs have been described as compounds with subacute cardiotoxic potential in rats owed to alterations of the cardiovascular function and ultrastructural heart damage. These molecules are also well known in vitro inducers of cell death. The aim of this study was to explore the presence of cardiomyocyte death after repeated subacute exposure of rats to AZA-1 and YTX for 15\u00a0days. Because autophagy and apoptosis are often found in dying cardiomyocytes, several autophagic and apoptotic markers were determined by western blot in heart tissues of these rats. The results showed that hearts from YTX-treated rats presented increased levels of the autophagic markers microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1, nevertheless AZA-1-treated hearts evidenced increased levels of the apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3 and -8, cleaved PARP and Fas ligand. Therefore, while YTX-induced damage to the heart triggers autophagic processes, apoptosis activation occurs in the case of AZA-1. For the first time, activation of cell death signals in cardiomyocytes is demonstrated for these toxins with in vivo experiments, which may be related to alterations of the cardiovascular function.", "journal": "Archives of toxicology", "date": "2016-10-07", "authors": ["Sara FFerreiro", "NataliaVilari\u00f1o", "CristinaCarrera", "M CarmenLouzao", "Germ\u00e1nSantamarina", "Antonio GCantalapiedra", "J ManuelCifuentes", "Andr\u00e9sCrespo", "Luis MBotana"], "doi": "10.1007/s00204-016-1862-0"}
{"title": "Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), a promising new material for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) is currently a prime focus of research because of an enormous clinical need. In the present work, a novel functional material, poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO), a medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), produced using bacterial fermentation, was studied as a new potential material for CTE. Engineered constructs with improved mechanical properties, crucial for supporting the organ during new tissue regeneration, and enhanced surface topography, to allow efficient cell adhesion and proliferation, were fabricated. Results showed that the mechanical properties of the final patches were close to that of cardiac muscle. Biocompatibility of neat P(3HO) patches, assessed using neonatal ventricular rat myocytes (NVRM), showed that the polymer was as good as collagen in terms of cell viability, proliferation and adhesion. Enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation properties were observed when porous and fibrous structures were incorporated into the patches. In addition, no deleterious effect was observed on adult cardiomyocyte contraction when cardiomyocytes were seeded on the P(3HO) patches. Hence, P(3HO)-based multifunctional cardiac patches are promising constructs for efficient CTE. This work will have a positive impact on the development of P(3HO) and other PHAs as a novel new family of biodegradable functional materials with huge potential in a range of different biomedical applications, particularly CTE, leading to further interest and exploitation of these materials.

The number and diversity of mouse models is increasing rapidly through genetic engineering strategies, but detailed characterization of these models is still challenging because most phenotypic information is derived from time-consuming histological and biochemical analyses. To expand the biochemists' toolkit, we generated a set of targeted proteomic assays for mouse plasma and heart tissue, utilizing bottom-up LC/MRM-MS with isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards. Protein quantitation was performed using reverse standard curves, with LC-MS platform and curve performance evaluated by quality control standards. The assays comprising the final panel (101 peptides for 81 proteins in plasma; 227 peptides for 159 proteins in heart tissue) have been rigorously developed under a fit-for-purpose approach and utilize stable-isotope labeled peptides for every analyte to provide high-quality, precise relative quantitation. In addition, the peptides have been tested to be interference-free and the assay is highly multiplexed, with reproducibly determined protein concentrations spanning >4 orders of magnitude.

For possibly producing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell microtissues (hBMSCMT) on an elastic silk fibroin (SF)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) based patches is hereby designed. After an elastic SF-PCL (SP) patch is fabricated, hyaluronic acid (HA)/SF-PCL(HSP) and HA-GRGD/SF-PCL(HGSP) patches are fabricated by photochemically grafting HA and HA-GRGD onto SP surfaces. The results show that the proliferations of hBMSC on HGSP patches significantly exceed those on the other patches, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. Notably, the formation of 5-aza inducing cardiomyogenic differentiations of hBMSCMT/HGSP patches is observed with typical sizes of \u2248317 \u03bcm wide and 26 \u03bcm high. The cardiomyogenesis of hBMSCMT/HGSP patches including the expressions of cardiac-specific genes (e.g., Gata4) and proteins (e.g., connexin43 (CX43)) significantly exceeds those of hBMSC monolayer on the HSP and SP patches. Promoting in vitro cardiomyogenesis of hBMSC with forming cardiomyogenic differentiation of hBMSCMT/HGSP hybrid patch is possibly mediated by the synergistic functions of HA-GRGD on enhancing the activity of F-actin.

Swimming exercise was performed for 8 weeks (60 min/day, 5 days/week). Myocyte shortening, L-type Ca2+ currents and associated Ca2+ transients were measured from ventricular myocytes at 36 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. NOX-4 levels, aconitase activity, glutathione measurements and ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy were conducted in heart tissue.\nSwimming exercise reversed the reduced shortening and slowed kinetics of aged cardiomyocytes. Although the current density was similar for all groups, Ca2+ transients were higher in SO and Ex-O myocytes with respect to the SY group. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients and the integrated NCX current were lower in cardiomyocytes of SY rats compared with other groups, suggesting an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content in an aged heart. Aging led to upregulated cardiac NOX-4 along with declined aconitase activity. Although it did not reverse these oxidative parameters, swimming exercise achieved a significant increase in glutathione levels and improved structural alterations of old rats' hearts.\nWe conclude that swimming exercise upregulates antioxidant defense capacity and improves structural abnormalities of senescent female rat heart, although it does not change Ca2+ handling alterations further.

{"title": "In Vivo Cardioprotective Effects and Pharmacokinetic Profile of N-Propyl Caffeamide Against Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "Caffeic acid derivatives constitute a class of potent anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective drug candidates. We recently synthesized a new caffeic acid derivative N-propyl caffeamide (PCA). Our pilot experiments demonstrated that PCA enhanced the survival of rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells against oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation challenge in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, PCA exhibited better cardioprotective potential than caffeic acid phenethyl ester and propyl caffeate. Thus, we hypothesized that PCA could protect heart against ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. We first determined the stability and pharmacokinetic profile of PCA in male Sprague-Dawley rats by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and MS/MS detections. The stability of PCA in rat plasma was defined by the half-life of 31.39, 7.19 and 1.37\u00a0h in rat plasma at 25, 37 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. To study the pharmacokinetic profiles, PCA was injected into male SD rats at the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg via intravenous bolus administration. PCA showed the elimination half-life of approximate 235\u00a0min in rats. We subsequently evaluated the cardioprotective potential of PCA in mice model of myocardial infarction. Our results demonstrated that PCA effectively reduced infarct size and release of myocardial enzymes (e.g., CK, CK-MB and LDH). Biochemical analyses suggested that PCA increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., CAT and SOD) while attenuated lipid peroxidation. Moreover, PCA profoundly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in infarcted myocardium. Consistently, PCA increased the expression level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 whereas suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in cardiac tissues. Collectively, PCA appears to be a novel bioavailable and stable pharmacological treatment for myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis", "date": "2016-08-03", "authors": ["Yuan-YuanCheng", "DanLuo", "ZhengyuanXia", "Hung-FatTse", "XuechenLi", "JianhuiRong"], "doi": "10.1007/s00005-016-0413-y"}
{"title": "A novel micro-to-macro approach for cardiac tissue mechanics.", "abstract": "For studying cardiac mechanics, hyperelastic anisotropic computational models have been developed which require the tissue anisotropic and hyperelastic parameters. These parameters are obtained by tissue samples mechanically testing. The validity of such parameters are limited to the specific tissue sample only. They are not adaptable for pathological tissues commonly associated with tissue microstructure alterations. To investigate cardiac tissue mechanics, a novel approach is proposed to model hyperelasticity and anisotropy. This approach is adaptable to various tissue microstructural constituent's distributions in normal and pathological tissues. In this approach, the tissue is idealized as composite material consisting of cardiomyocytes distributed in extracellular matrix (ECM). The major myocardial tissue constituents are mitochondria and myofibrils while the main ECM's constituents are collagen fibers and fibroblasts. Accordingly, finite element simulations of uniaxial and equibiaxial tests of normal and infarcted tissue samples with known amounts of these constituents were conducted, leading to corresponding tissue stress-strain data that were fitted to anisotropic/hyperelastic models. The models were validated where they showed good agreement characterized by maximum average stress-strain errors of 16.17 and 10.01% for normal and infarcted cardiac tissue, respectively.

For this purpose, the present study is aimed to research the effects of aging on AQP 1 and AQP 4 in heart tissue.\nIn this study, 14 Balb/C type white mice were used. Animals were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of 2-month-old young animals (n=7), and group II consisted of 18-month-old animals (n=7). To determine the AQP1 and AQP4 expression in the myocardium, the heart tissue was removed to perform western blotting and immunohistochemical and histopathological evaluations.\nMuscle fibers of the heart in aged animals were more irregular and loosely organized in hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) stained sections. Hscore analysis revealed that AQP1 and AQP4 immunoreactivity significantly increased in heart tissues of old mice compared with those of young mice (p<0.001). In addition, AQP1 and AQP4 protein expressions in the tissues of old animals were increased significantly according to western blot analysis (p=0.018 and p<0.001 for AQP1 and AQP4, respectively).\nIncreased AQP1 and AQP4 levels in the heart tissue may be correlated with the maintenance of water and electrolytes balance, which decreases with aging. In this context, it might be the result of a compensatory response to decreased AQP4 functions.

After 24 h of the administrations, inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme as well as heme oxygenase (HO) activity were measured in both plasma and cardiac tissue, along with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). We found that OPA caused a significant elevation in the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, increased MPO activity and decreased HO enzyme activity in the plasma. While OPA induces inflammation in the plasma, it did not change the level of inflammatory mediators in the cardiac tissue and the concentrations of serum ALT and AST.

We tested the hypothesis that cardiac macs are M2 polarized in infarcted mouse and human hearts and that polarization is dependent on mac-derived uPA.\nStudies were performed using uninjured (UI) or infarcted (MI) hearts of uPA overexpressing (SR-uPA), uPA null, or nontransgenic littermate (Ntg) mice. At 7days post-infarction, cardiac mac were isolated, RNA extracted and M2 markers Arg1, YM1, and Fizz1 measured with qrtPCR. Histologic analysis for cardiac fibrosis, mac and myofibroblasts was performed at the same time-point. Cardiac macs were also isolated from Ntg hearts and RNA collected after primary isolation or culture with vehicle, IL-4 or plasmin and M2 marker expression measured. Cardiac tissue and blood was collected from humans with ischemic heart disease.

There was significant up-regulation of cardiac mac Arg1 and YM1 with MI in both WT and uPA null mice (n=4-9 per genotype and condition). Treatment with plasmin increased expression of Arg1 and YM1 in cultured cardiac macs.

Cardiac macs isolated from human hearts with ischemic heart disease expressed increased levels of the M2 marker CD206 in comparison to blood-derived macs (4.9\u00b11.3).\nCardiac macs in mouse and human hearts adopt a M2 phenotype in association with fibrosis. Plasmin can induce an M2 phenotype in cardiac macs. However, M2 activation can occur in the heart in vivo in the absence of uPA indicating that alternative pathways to activate plasmin are present in the heart.

To further characterize Cnm as a virulence factor, the cnm gene from S. mutans strain OMZ175 was expressed in the non-pathogenic Lactococcus lactis NZ9800 using a nisin-inducible system. Despite the absence of the machinery necessary for Cnm glycosylation, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses demonstrated that Cnm was effectively expressed and translocated to the cell wall of L. lactis. Similar to S. mutans, expression of Cnm in L. lactis enabled robust binding to collagen and laminin, invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells and increased virulence in G. mellonella. Using an ex vivo human heart tissue colonization model, we showed that Cnm-positive strains of either S. mutans or L. lactis outcompete their Cnm-negative counterparts for tissue colonization. Finally, Cnm expression facilitated L. lactis adhesion and colonization in a rabbit model of infective endocarditis.

{"title": "Combinatorial therapy with three-dimensionally cultured adipose-derived stromal cells and self-assembling peptides to enhance angiogenesis and preserve cardiac function in infarcted hearts.", "abstract": "Even though stem cell therapy is a promising angiogenic strategy to treat ischaemic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), therapeutic efficacy is limited by low survival and retention of transplanted cells in ischaemic tissues. In addition, therapeutic angiogenesis depends on stimulating host angiogenesis with paracrine factors released by transplanted cells rather than on direct blood vessel formation by transplanted cells. In the present study, to overcome these limitations and to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MI treatment, combinatorial therapy with three-dimensional cell masses (3DCMs) and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) was tested in a rat MI model. Spheroid-type 3DCMs, which are vascular differentiation-induced cells, were prepared by culturing human adipose-derived stromal cells on a fibroblast growth factor-immobilized surface. The SAPs were used as the carrier material to increase engraftment of transplanted cells. After coronary artery ligation, 3DCMs were combined with SAPs and were transplanted into ischaemic lesions. The therapeutic potential was evaluated 4\u00a0weeks after treatment. By combining 3DCMs and SAPs, survival and retention of transplanted cells increased threefold when compared with treatment with 3DCMs alone and transplanted cells established vascular networks in infarcted hearts. In addition, the size of the infarct in the 3DCM\u00a0+\u00a0SAP group was reduced to 6.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.83% by the promotion of host angiogenesis and cardiac function was preserved, as demonstrated by a 54.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.42% increase in the ejection fraction.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of depression and cardiovascular disorders; its contribution to depression-cardiovascular comorbidity has not yet been investigated. Methods Adolescent rats were subjected to 4 weeks of isolation (social isolation stress or SIS) or social conditions (control), and then they were divided into treatment (fluoxetine, 7.5\u2009mg/kg/day for 21 days) and non-treatment groups. After different housing conditions and treatment, animals were evaluated by behavioural tests (n\u2009=\u20096-8) and mitochondrial assessments (n\u2009=\u20093) of brain and cardiac tissues. Results We found that juvenile SIS induced behavioural abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction in adulthood. We showed that juvenile SIS was associated with impaired respiratory chain complex, which leads to reactive oxygen species formation, oxidative damage and ATP abatement in both brain and heart. Administration of FLX (7.5\u2009mg/kg/day) during the isolation period attenuated the effects of SIS on the brain mitochondria and behavioural abnormalities, but had little or no effect on SIS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac tissue. Conclusions This suggests that juvenile SIS predisposes the co-occurrence of depression and cardiovascular disease through mitochondrial dysfunction and that therapeutic effect of fluoxetine is partly mediated by its effect on mitochondrial function.", "journal": "The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry", "date": "2016-04-01", "authors": ["NazaninSonei", "ShayanAmiri", "ImanJafarian", "MahdiehAnoush", "MaryamRahimi-Balaei", "HugoBergen", "AryaHaj-Mirzaian", "Mir-JamalHosseini"], "doi": "10.3109/15622975.2016.1149218"}

{"title": "BMP protein-mediated crosstalk between inflammatory cells and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Following cardiac injury, the ischaemic heart tissue is characterized by the invasion of pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Any engineered cardiac tissue will inevitably interact with the inflammatory environment found at the site of myocardial infarction at the time of implantation. However, the interactions between the inflammatory and the cardiac repair cells remain poorly understood. Here we recapitulated in vitro some of the important cellular events found at the site of myocardial injury, such as macrophage recruitment and their effect on cardiac differentiation and maturation, by taking into account the involvement of paracrine-mediated signalling. By using a 3D inverted invasion assay, we found that cardiomyocyte (CM) conditioned medium can trigger the recruitment of pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, through a mechanism that involves, in part, CM-derived BMP4. Pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages were also found to affect CM proliferation and differentiation potential, in part due to BMP molecules secreted by macrophages. These effects involved the activation of the canonical outside-in signalling pathways, such as SMAD1,5,8, which are known to be activated during myocardial injury in vivo. In the present study we propose a new role for CM- and macrophage-derived BMP proteins during the recruitment of macrophage subtypes and the maturation of repair cells, representing an important step towards creating a functional cardiac patch with superior therapeutic properties.

{"title": "Three-dimensional functional human myocardial tissues fabricated from induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "The most radical treatment currently available for severe heart failure is heart transplantation; however, the number of donor hearts is limited. A better approach is to make human cardiac tissues. We developed an original cell sheet-based tissue-engineering technology to fabricate human cardiac tissue by layering myocardial cell sheets. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes to fabricate cardiomyocyte sheets. Initially, three-layer human iPS cardiomyocyte (hiPSCM) sheets were transplanted on subcutaneous tissues of nude rats. Next, to fabricate thicker tissue, three-layer sheets were transplanted on one day, then additional three-layer sheets were transplanted onto them the following day, after the first sheets were vascularized. On day 3, the final three-layer sheets were again transplanted, creating a nine-layer graft (multi-step transplantation procedure). In the last step, six-layer sheets were transplanted on fat tissues of the inguinal portion, which were subsequently resected together with the femoral arteries and veins to make transplantable grafts with connectable vessels. They were then transplanted ectopically to the neck portion of other rats by anastomosing vessels with the host's jugular arteries and veins. Transplanted three-layer hiPSCMs were beating and, histologically, showed a cardiac muscle-like structure with vascular systems. Moreover, transplanted hiPSCMs proliferated and matured in vivo. Significantly thicker tissues were fabricated by a multi-step transplantation procedure. The ectopically transplanted graft survived and continued to beat. We succeeded in fabricating functional human cardiac tissue with cell sheet technology. Transplanting this cardiac tissue may become a new treatment option for severe heart failure.

{"title": "Investigation into the effects of varying frequency of mechanical stimulation in a cycle-by-cycle manner on engineered cardiac construct function.", "abstract": "Mechanical stimulation has been used extensively to improve the function of cardiac engineered tissue, as it mimics the physical environment in which the tissue is situated during normal development. However, previous mechanical stimulation has been carried out under a constant frequency that more closely resembles a diseased heart. The goal of this study was to create a bioreactor system that would allow us to control the mechanical stimulation of engineered cardiac tissue on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This unique system allows us to determine the effects on cardiac construct function of introducing variability to the mechanical stretch. To test our bioreactor system, constructs created from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes entrapped in fibrin hydrogels were stimulated under various regimes for 2 weeks and then assessed for functional outcomes. No differences were observed in the final cell number in each condition, indicating that variability in frequency did not have a negative effect on viability. The forces were higher for all mechanical stimulation groups compared to static controls, although no differences were observed between the mechanically stimulated conditions, indicating that variable frequency on a cycle-by-cycle basis has limited effects on the resulting force. Although differences in the observed twitch force were not observed, differences in the protein expression indicate that variable-frequency mechanical stimulation had an effect on cell-cell coupling and growth pathway activation in the constructs. Thus, this bioreactor system provides a valuable tool for further development and optimization of engineered myocardial tissue as a repair or replacement strategy for patients undergoing heart failure.

{"title": "Optimizing a spontaneously contracting heart tissue patch with rat neonatal cardiac cells on fibrin gel.", "abstract": "Engineered cardiac tissues have been constructed with primary or stem cell-derived cardiac cells on natural or synthetic scaffolds. They represent a tremendous potential for the treatment of injured areas through the addition of tensional support and delivery of sufficient cells. In this study, 1-6 million (M) neonatal cardiac cells were seeded on fibrin gels to fabricate cardiac tissue patches, and the effects of culture time and cell density on spontaneous contraction rates, twitch forces and paced response frequencies were measured. Electrocardiograms and signal volume index of connexin 43 were also analysed. Patches of 1-6 M cell densities exhibited maximal contraction rates in the range 305-410 beats/min (bpm) within the first 4 days after plating; low cell density (1-3 M) patches sustained rhythmic contraction longer than high cell density patches (4-6 M). Patches with 1-6 M cell densities generated contractile forces in the range 2.245-14.065 mN/mm", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2014-04-29", "authors": ["Ze-WeiTao", "MohamedMohamed", "MatthewHogan", "LauraGutierrez", "Ravi KBirla"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1895"}
