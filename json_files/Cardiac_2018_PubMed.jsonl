{"title": "Pre-Conditioning Stem Cells in a Biomimetic Environment for Enhanced Cardiac Tissue Repair: ", "abstract": "Stem cell-based therapies represent a valid approach to restore cardiac function due to their beneficial effect in reducing scar area formation and promoting angiogenesis. However, their translation into the clinic is limited by the poor differentiation and inability to secrete sufficient therapeutic factors. To address this issue, several strategies such as genetic modification and biophysical preconditioning have been used to enhance the efficacy of stem cells for cardiac tissue repair.\nIn this study, a biomimetic approach was used to mimic the natural mechanical stimulation of the myocardium tissue. Specifically, human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were cultured on a thin gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA) hydrogel disc and placed on top of a beating cardiomyocyte layer. qPCR studies and metatranscriptomic analysis of hASCs gene expression were investigated to confirm the correlation between mechanical stimuli and cardiomyogenic differentiation. \nThe cyclic strain generated by cardiomyocytes significantly upregulated the expression of both mechanotransduction and cardiomyogenic genes in hASCs as compared to the static control group. The inherent angiogenic secretion profile of hASCs was not hindered by the mechanical stimulation provided by the designed biomimetic system. Finally, \nOverall, these findings indicate that cyclic strain provided by the designed biomimetic system is an essential stimulant for hASCs cardiomyogenic differentiation, and therefore can be a potential solution to improve stem-cell based efficacy for cardiovascular repair.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular bioengineering", "date": "2019-10-04", "authors": ["Aparna RChakravarti", "SettimioPacelli", "PerwezAlam", "SamikBagchi", "SamanModaresi", "AndrasCzirok", "Rafeeq P HAhmed", "ArghyaPaul"], "doi": "10.1007/s12195-018-0543-x\n10.1155/2017/8286248\n10.1007/s00109-017-1591-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0127903\n10.1042/CBI20100417\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2008.01.005\n10.1096/fj.201601090R\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.229658\n10.3390/jfb2020067\n10.1073/pnas.1012859108\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1016/S0888-7543(11)80006-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.884403\n10.1002/cphy.c150006\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.07.032\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e318282ab8f\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.10.050\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.022\n10.1186/1479-5876-9-29\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.07.071\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034960\n10.1016/j.nmd.2005.08.004\n10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200872\n10.1253/circj.68.691\n10.1006/geno.2000.6461\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.01.002\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.0178\n10.1007/s10741-008-9113-y\n10.1093/nar/gkp773\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.04.012\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000165696.25680.ce\n10.1038/ncpcardio0770\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.005\n10.21037/jtd.2017.03.179\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243071\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.02.076\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000939\n10.1038/ncomms11303\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01086.x\n10.1038/s41598-017-06028-y\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.10.046\n10.1038/nrm.2017.87\n10.19104/jbtr.2014.107\n10.19104/jbtr.2014.107\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.042\n10.1021/nn5020787\n10.2217/nnm.11.130\n10.1007/s12013-011-9323-0\n10.1074/jbc.M109.007021\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.09.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134093\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1104\n10.1096/fj.05-4723fje\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.04.010\n10.1016/j.gendis.2014.07.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvr053\n10.1007/s11936-014-0323-4\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.1661\n10.1006/geno.1994.1271\n10.1038/nbt.1621\n10.1021/bm990017d\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi193\n10.1016/0888-7543(90)90168-T\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.025\n10.1039/C5NR07806G\n10.1002/wics.147\n10.1080/02648725.2007.10648105\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.045\n10.1093/europace/eup304\n10.1038/cr.2008.152\n10.1186/s13287-017-0578-2"}

Among the various isoforms of apelin, an increase in the apelin-36 plasma level has been associated with oxidative stress, and this isoform has various biological effects, such as positive inotropic, vasodilatory, and antiatherosclerotic effects. Therefore, apelin-36 may be used as a biomarker of heart failure (HF). Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF cannot be achieved without the use of animal models. However, it is unclear whether chronic systemic hypoxia can cause HF in rats.

Nanopattern fidelity was maintained throughout the fabrication and functionalization processes, and no loss in conductive behavior occurred due to the presence of the nanotopographical features. AMSF+PPy substrates were biocompatible and stable, maintaining high cell viability over a 21-day culture period while displaying no signs of PPy delamination. The presence of anisotropic topographical cues led to increased cellular organization and sarcomere development, and electroconductive cues promoted a significant improvement in the expression and polarization of connexin 43 (Cx43), a critical regulator of cell-cell electrical coupling. The combination of biomimetic topography and electroconductivity also increased the expression of genes that encode key proteins involved in regulating the contractile and electrophysiological function of mature human cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

CA activities were significantly decreased in testis, liver, and heart tissues of rats given HSP, SA, SA+HSP-100, and SA+HSP-200 compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In liver tissue, AChE and BChE enzymes activities were significantly reduced given in all groups. In all tissues, \u03b1-Gly activity was reduced given in all groups. In the current study, aldose reductase enzyme activity was reduced significantly in testis, brain, and heart tissues of all groups compared to standard (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). PON1 enzyme activity was increased significantly in kidney and liver tissues of rats HSP groups and decreased SA groups compared to control. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: \u03b1-Glycosidase is the key enzyme involved in the digestion of the carbohydrate. Another enzyme \u03b1-amylase hydrolyzes the \u03b1-linked polysaccharide derivatives into oligosaccharide molecules, and \u03b1-glycosidase enzymes, which are characterized in small intestine, catalyze the final stage in the digestive mechanism of carbohydrate molecule to release absorbable monosaccharides like glucose. Conforming to the cholinergic hypothesis, impairment of the cholinergic pathways plays a good role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) problems with the regulation of traumatic brain injury and sleep. The AD is the main reason for dementia disease, and mild to moderate cases are generally treated with AChE inhibitors.

The rats were divide into groups of control (CTL), arachis oilasnandrolone solvent (Ar), nandrolone (Nan) (received a dose of 5 mg/kg twice/week for 8 weeks), mild swimming exercise training (mEx), severe exercise (sEx), sEx + Nan, mEx + Nan, mEx + Ar, and sEx + Ar. During the 8 weeks of swimming exercise, the animals carried dumbbells equivalent to 2% of their body weight, which was gradually increased and reached 5% and 8% in the 6th week for mild and severe exercises, respectively. Finally, ECGs recording and samplings were done.\nBoth types of exercise, without nandrolone, significantly reduced the heart rate and increased the RR interval of ECG. Nandrolone alone and with mild (P < 0.050) and intense exercise (P < 0.010 vs. CTL) increased the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) index. Left ventricular volume was significantly higher in the Nan group (P < 0.050) compared to the CTL group and all exercise groups (P < 0.010) compared to the Nan, CTL, and Ar groups. Myocytes volume increased in the presence of both of mild and high-intensity exercise plus nandrolone (P < 0.050 vs. CTL and Ar groups). Hydroxyproline value of the heart was significantly higher in the nandrolone group compared to all other groups (P < 0.001). Exercise prevented the effect of nandrolone on hydroxyproline.\nBoth levels of swimming exercise prevent the effect of nandrolone on the production of hydroxyproline and fibrotic cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Addiction & health", "date": "2019-05-21", "authors": ["SiyavashJoukar", "MahdiehYoosefnia", "VidaNaderi-Boldaji", "HamidrezaNasri", "ForouzanRafie"], "doi": "10.22122/ahj.v10i3.587"}

{"title": "Harnessing cell pluripotency for cardiovascular regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), in particular embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, have received enormous attention in cardiovascular regenerative medicine owing to their ability to expand and differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes and other cardiovascular cell types. Despite the potential applications of hPSCs for tissue regeneration in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease, whether hPSC-based therapies can be safe and efficacious remains inconclusive, with strong evidence from clinical trials lacking. Critical factors limiting therapeutic efficacy are the degree of maturity and purity of the hPSC-derived differentiated progeny, and the tumorigenic risk associated with residual undifferentiated cells. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in cardiac-cell differentiation from hPSCs and in the direct reprogramming of non-myocyte cells for cardiovascular regenerative applications. We also discuss approaches for the delivery of cells to diseased tissue, and how such advances are contributing to progress in cardiac tissue engineering for tackling heart disease.", "journal": "Nature biomedical engineering", "date": "2019-04-24", "authors": ["HaodongChen", "AngelaZhang", "Joseph CWu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41551-018-0244-8\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1073/pnas.1708991114\n10.1172/JCI80575\n10.1146/annurev-genet-112414-054911\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.084343\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.015231\n10.1038/nature19815\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.868885\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1002/0471142905.hg2103s87\n10.1002/stem.545\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0363\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.10.009\n10.1038/nprot.2017.089\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1007/s12013-016-0758-1\n10.1038/nnano.2011.160\n10.1161/circulationaha.116.024145\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.083\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007920\n10.1073/pnas.032074999\n10.1038/nbt.1605\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.194233\n10.2217/17460751.3.5.693\n10.1073/pnas.1310675110\n10.1073/pnas.1306562110\n10.1002/jbm.a.35607\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.204800\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.005\n10.1073/pnas.1702295114\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.230938\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008443\n10.1038/srep06716\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0882\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.07.014\n10.1093/cvr/cvx125\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr166\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.11.006\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu192\n10.1161/01.RES.0000205765.28940.93\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024754\n10.1002/stem.321\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.849596\n10.1038/nbt.3048\n10.1038/s41551-016-0003\n10.1038/nprot.2017.080\n10.1089/scd.2016.0208\n10.1073/pnas.1509834113\n10.1038/nature15372\n10.1126/science.1229765\n10.1172/JCI88759\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311293\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.09.011\n10.1161/circresaha.116.310277\n10.15252/emmm.201504395\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.05.005\n10.1073/pnas.1301019110\n10.1126/science.aaf1502\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.11.010\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.270264\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.12.001\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309833\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007394\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.002\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf8781\n10.1038/nmat4583\n10.1002/stem.2732\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.021\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.015\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.1517/17425247.2013.739156\n10.1242/dev.156166\n10.1038/s41598-017-05018-4\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311769\n10.1038/nrd.2016.245\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2750\n10.1002/adfm.201704939\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.002"}
{"title": "Luteolin protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation and activating the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a well-known risk factor for the development of heart failure. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), and this nexus represents an attractive target to combat this disease. Naturally occurring flavonoid luteolin exhibits both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in various systems.\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate potential cardioprotective effects of luteolin in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice with type 1 diabetes.\nC57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce DCM. High glucose (HG) was used to induce H9C2 cells injury in vitro. Cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation and oxidative stress were studied both in vitro and in vivo.\nOur studies show that luteolin significantly reduces HG-induced inflammatory phenotype and oxidative stress in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. We found that the mechanisms involved inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway and the activation of antioxidant nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. Modulation of these pathways resulted in reduced expression of matrix proteins and cellular hypertrophy. Luteolin also prevented cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic mice. These readouts were also associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress biomarkers.\nOur results indicate that luteolin protects heart tissues in STZ-induced diabetic mice through modulating Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress and NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that luteolin may be a potential therapeutic agent for DCM.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2019-04-23", "authors": ["LiLi", "WuLuo", "YuanyuanQian", "WeiweiZhu", "JianchangQian", "JieliLi", "YiyiJin", "XuzhongXu", "GuangLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.034"}
{"title": "Comparative study of subchronic toxicities of mosquito repellents (coils, mats and liquids) on vital organs in Swiss albino mice.", "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the toxicities of different types of mosquito repellents i.e. coils, mats and liquid vapors in animal models. Different types of mosquito repellents including liquid vaporizers, coils and mats have been extensively used by the people to get protection from the mosquitoes and diseases associated with them. The active constituents of these repellents include; allethrins, pyrethrins, paraffin and various other derivatives, are well known for their toxicities. Exposure of albino mice to these repellents for 3\u202fh per day over a period of 20\u202fdays produced significant toxicological effects on vital body organs including; liver, lungs, kidneys, brain and heart. The order of toxicity of different repellents on nervous and hepatic tissues was found to be: Coil\u202f>\u202fLiquid\u202f>\u202fMat while in renal and cardiac tissues, the coil was again found to be the most toxic one, mat with medium toxicity whereas liquid as least toxic (Coil\u202f>\u202fMat\u202f>\u202fliquid). Lungs tissues are almost equally affected by all the repellants. On the basis of current findings, it has been concluded that exposure to various types of mosquito repellents can be deleterious to health and can cause various health related issues by producing pathological changes in the vital organs.", "journal": "Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society", "date": "2019-04-13", "authors": ["MamunaNaz", "NajeebRehman", "MohdNazam Ansari", "MehnazKamal", "Majid AGanaie", "Amani SAwaad", "Saleh IAlqasoumi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsps.2018.12.002"}

The main advantages of conductive hydrogels include not only their physical properties but also their adequate electrical properties, which provide electrical signals to cells efficiently. However, when introducing a conductive material into a non-conductive hydrogel, a conflicting relationship between the electrical and mechanical properties may develop. This review examines the strengths and weaknesses of the generation of conductive hydrogels using various conductive materials such as metal nanoparticles, carbons, and conductive polymers. The fabrication method of blending, coating, and in situ polymerization is also added.

However, targeting drugs to the heart is challenging, owing to its dynamic mechanical motions and large cardiac output. Here, we show that the modification of protein and peptide therapeutics with tannic acid-a flavonoid found in plants that adheres to extracellular matrices, elastins and collagens-improves their ability to specifically target heart tissue. Tannic-acid-modified (TANNylated) proteins do not adsorb on endothelial glycocalyx layers in blood vessels, yet they penetrate the endothelium to thermodynamically bind to myocardium extracellular matrix before being internalized by myoblasts. In a rat model of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, TANNylated basic fibroblast growth factor significantly reduced infarct size and increased cardiac function.

We designed an immunohistochemical study involving cardiac tissue samples obtained from 10 cadavers with the aim of determining whether there are TC-like interstitial cells that populate the interstitial space other than the mural microvascular cells. We applied the markers for CD31, CD34, PDGRF\u03b1, CD117/c-kit, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). We found that, in relation to two-dimensional cuts, the endothelial tubes could be misidentified as TC-like cells, the difference being the positive identification of endothelial lumina.

Catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of cardiac tissue has achieved only modest efficacy, owing to the inaccurate identification of ablation targets by current electrical mapping techniques, which can lead to extensive lesions and to a prolonged, poorly tolerated procedure. Here we show that personalized virtual-heart technology based on cardiac imaging and computational modelling can identify optimal infarct-related VT ablation targets in retrospective animal (5 swine) and human studies (21 patients) and in a prospective feasibility study (5 patients). We first assessed in retrospective studies (one of which included a proportion of clinical images with artifacts) the capability of the technology to determine the minimum-size ablation targets for eradicating all VTs. In the prospective study, VT sites predicted by the technology were targeted directly, without relying on prior electrical mapping.

However, these cells are both structurally and functionally -immature, primarily due to their differentiation into cardiomyocytes occurring under static culture which only reproduces biomolecular cues and ignores the dynamic hemo-dynamic cues that shape early and late heart development during cardiogenesis. To evaluate the effects of hemodynamic stimuli on hiPSC-CM maturation, we used the biomimetic cardiac tissue model to reproduce the hemodynamics and pressure/volume changes associated with heart development. Following 7 days of gradually increasing stimulation, we show that hemodynamic loading results in (a) enhanced alignment of the cells and extracellular matrix, (b) significant increases in genes associated with physiological hypertrophy, (c) noticeable changes in sarcomeric organization and potential changes to cellular metabolism, and (d) a significant increase in fractional shortening, suggestive of a positive force frequency response.

One of the\u00a0rare presentations is the likely simulation of disease with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies like left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction due to the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and irregular septal hypertrophy secondary to amyloid deposits. We present a case of cardiac amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma who presented with dynamic LVOT obstruction resembling hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and complicated by acute pulmonary edema. These complicated cases can be initially treated for pulmonary edema with an elevation of the head of the bed, furosemide, and nitroglycerin intravenously. For multiple myeloma, chemotherapy was continued.

{"title": "Hyperoxic or hypoxic environment?", "abstract": "We read the article by Khan et al. (2017) in a recent issue of this journal with great interest. We would like to congratulate the authors for this report. In the article, the authors focused primarily on the characteristics of adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) by altering culture environment. The results of the study showed that culture medium containing 0.5% gelatin enhanced the proliferation rate, induced immunosuppression, and activated BMP-7 and the wnt/AXIN/\u03b2-catenin pathway in Ad-MSCs. However, we believe there is a misunderstanding in the introduction section of the article. A review of the literature shows that certain characteristics of MSCs can be modified with altered culture environments or preconditioned incubation processes. Khan et al. also cited a review published by Song et al. in 2010, as mentioned in the Introduction. This study indicated that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxic conditions enhanced the activity of the MSCs, suggesting a new perspective for the cellular treatment of cardiac tissue damages. In this review, hypoxic conditions were shown to have cytoprotective effects for MSCs, regulated paracrine factors, and increased the VEGF secretion (Song et al., 2010). Likewise, several studies with different designs in the literature yielded similar results (Kadle et al., 2016; Ciria et al., 2017). Therefore, we believe that the term \"hyperoxic conditions\" mentioned in the introduction of Khan et al.'s article (in citation to the study of Song et al.) is confusing. We recommend that this erroneous term be corrected to prevent any misunderstanding for the readers. We believe that the authors of the article would regard our opinion as a contribution.", "journal": "Turkish journal of biology = Turk biyoloji dergisi", "date": "2019-03-01", "authors": ["\u00d6zer AylinG\u00fcrpinar", "EmreKubat", "Mehmet AliOnur"], "doi": "10.3906/biy-1712-89"}
{"title": "Preparation and characterization of electrospun rGO-poly(ester amide) conductive scaffolds.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering scaffolds should support tissue maturation through exposure to relevant stimuli and through successful cell infiltration. External electrical stimulation is particularly relevant for cardiac and neural applications, and requires conductive scaffolds to propagate electrical signals; cell infiltration is only possible with scaffolds that have sufficient porosity. The aim of this study was to impart conductivity and increased porosity of electrospun poly(ester amide) (PEA) scaffolds. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was incorporated into PEA and PEA-chitosan fibrous scaffolds, which increased scaffold conductivity and supported cardiac differentiation. The novel combination of ultrasonication and leaching of a sacrificial polymer was used to modify scaffold porosity, and resulted in an increase in pore area evaluated through image analysis. This approach aims to potentially promote tissue maturation with electrospun PEA scaffolds, by modifying both scaffold conductivity and porosity. This extends the relevance of electrospun PEA scaffolds to cardiac tissue engineering for the first time.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "The cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (Cardioxane) is consistent with sequestration of poly(ADP-ribose) by self-assembly and not depletion of topoisomerase 2B.", "abstract": "Following systematic scrutiny of the evidence in support of the hypothesis that the cardioprotective mechanism of action of dexrazoxane is mediated by a 'depletion' or 'downregulation' of Top2\u03b2 protein levels in heart tissue, the author concludes that this hypothesis is untenable. In seeking to understand how dexrazoxane protects the heart, the outcomes of a customised association rule learning algorithm incorporating the use of antecedent surrogate variables (CEME, 2017 McCormack Pharma) reveal a previously unknown relationship between dexrazoxane and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer. The author shows how this previously unknown relationship explains both acute and long-term cardioprotection in patients receiving anthracyclines. In addition, as a direct inhibitor of PAR dexrazoxane has access to the epigenome and this offers a new insight into protection by dexrazoxane against doxorubicin-induced late-onset damage [McCormack K, manuscript in preparation]. Notably, through this review article, the author illustrates the practical application of probing natural language text using an association rule learning algorithm for the discovery of new and interesting associations that, otherwise, would remain lost.

Mice with high-salt diet-induced hypertension were divided into four groups: Control (standard diet alone for 8 weeks), model (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks and intragastric administration of distilled water for the last 4 weeks), XJEK + high-salt-treated (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks and intragastric administration of XJEK for the last 4 weeks) and irbesartan + high-salt-treated (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks with intragastric administration of irbesartan for the last 4 weeks). The hemodynamic index and cardiac pathological changes in the hypertensive mice were then examined. An aortic ring apparatus was used to detect acetylcholine-dependent endothelium relaxation function. Colorimetric analysis was applied to determine serum nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content; ELISA was employed to measure brain natriuretic peptide, serum angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1 content and aldosterone; and immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in cardiac tissues. XJEK improved the heart systolic and diastolic function, ameliorated hemodynamic parameters and cardiovascular remodeling indices, blunted the cardiac pathological changes and improved endothelial dysfunction (ED) via boosting eNOS activity, promoting NO bioavailability and decreasing serum Ang II content. Furthermore, treatment with XJEK inhibited the increase of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression and the decrease of IL-10 expression in cardiac tissues, and ameliorated oxidative stress status.

{"title": "Optimizing Blended Collagen-Fibrin Hydrogels for Cardiac Tissue Engineering with Human iPSC-derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Natural polymer hydrogels are used ubiquitously as scaffold materials for cardiac tissue engineering as well as for soft tissue engineering more broadly because of FDA approval, minimal immunogenicity, and well-defined physiological clearance pathways. However, the relationships between natural polymer hydrogels and resident cell populations in directing the development of engineered tissues are poorly defined. This interaction\u00a0is of particular concern for tissues prepared with iPSC-derived cell populations, in which population purity and batch-to-batch variability become additional critical factors to consider. Herein, the design space for a blended fibrin and collagen scaffold is characterized for applications in creating engineered myocardium with human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Stiffness values of the acellular hydrogel formulations approach those of native myocardium in compression, but deviate significantly in tension when compared to rat myocardium in both transverse and longitudinal fiber orientations. A response surface methodology approach to understanding the relationship between collagen concentration, fibrin concentration, seeding density, and cardiac purity found a statistically significant predictive model across three repeated studies that confirms that all of these factors contribute to tissue compaction. In these constructs, increased fibrin concentration and seeding density were each associated with increased compaction, while increased collagen concentration was associated with decreased compaction.

However, the effects of GDF11 on Angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and expression of markers for volume overload and hypertrophy such as ANP, BNP and beta-MHC, as well as the relationship between GDF11 and CCL11 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are unclear. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the effects of GDF11 on ANG II-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and expression of ANP, BNP and beta-MHC in mice, and explore possible molecular mechanisms.\nVectors were constructed and viruses were packaged. Mouse cardiomyocytes were treated with ANG II for 24 h. Meanwhile, mouse cardiomyocytes were divided into 4 groups: (1) control; (2) ANG II; (3) ANG II+GDF11; and (4) ANG II+CCL11. Furthermore, mouse cardiomyocytes were treated with GDF11 and CCL11 proteins for 48 h, respectively. The thickness of IVS and LVPS during systole and diastole were measured by cardiac ultrasound in the mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The relative expression of ANP, BNP, beta-MHC, CCL11 and GDF11 in cardiomyocytes or heart tissue of mice was detected by qPCR or Western blot. 3'- UTR luciferase reporter assay was utilized to examine the relationship between GDF11 and the expression of CCL11.\nThe expression of ANP, BNP, and beta-MHC in mouse cardiomyocytes was significantly increased after the cells were treated with 800 nM ANG II, which was utilized in the following cell experiments. After ANG II treatment, 0.2 ng/ml GDF11 group displayed the highest inhibition of expression of ANP, BNP and beta-MHC in mouse cardiomyocytes, whereas 50 ng/ml CCL11 group displayed the highest stimulation of the expression. GDF11 at 10 ng/ml significantly decreased the expression of CCL11 in mouse cardiomyocytes as compared to the control group. Mice treated with ANG II had increased thickness of IVS and LVPS during both systole and diastole, which was significantly attenuated by GDF11 overexpression. GDF11 overexpression attenuated the increase in expression of ANP, BNP and beta-MHC in the mice model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The relative serum concentration of GDF11 was markedly decreased, and CCL11 was dramatically increased in mice with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. GDF11 overexpression restored the serum concentration of GDF11 and CCL11 in the mice model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, GDF11 interference group had markedly increased expression of CCL11, whereas GDF11 overexpression group had significantly decreased expression of CCL11 in luciferase reporter assay.\nGDF11 attenuated ANG II-induced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and expression of ANP, BNP and beta-MHC through down-regulating CCL11 in mice.", "journal": "Current molecular medicine", "date": "2019-02-05", "authors": ["ChenjunZhang", "YingWang", "ZhiruGe", "JieLin", "JiwenLiu", "XiaofeiYuan", "ZijunLin"], "doi": "10.2174/1566524019666190204112753"}

{"title": "Heart Rhythm Insights Into Structural Remodeling in Atrial Tissue: Timed Automata Approach.", "abstract": "The heart rhythm of a person following heart transplantation (HTX) is assumed to display an intrinsic cardiac rhythm because it is significantly less influenced by the autonomic nervous system-the main source of heart rate variability in healthy people. Therefore, such a rhythm provides evidence for arrhythmogenic processes developing, usually silently, in the cardiac tissue. A model is proposed to simulate alterations in the cardiac tissue and to observe the effects of these changes on the resulting heart rhythm. The hybrid automata framework used makes it possible to represent reliably and simulate efficiently both the electrophysiology of a cardiac cell and the tissue organization. The curve fitting method used in the design of the hybrid automaton cycle follows the well-recognized physiological phases of the atrial myocyte membrane excitation. Moreover, knowledge of the complex architecture of the right atrium, the ability of the almost free design of intercellular connections makes the automata approach the only one possible. Two particular aspects are investigated: impairment of the impulse transmission between cells and structural changes in intercellular connections. The first aspect models the observed fatigue of cells due to specific cardiac tissue diseases. The second aspect simulates the increase in collagen deposition with aging. Finally, heart rhythms arising from the model are validated with the sinus heart rhythms recorded in HTX patients. The modulation in the impairment of the impulse transmission between cells reveals qualitatively the abnormally high heart rate variability observed in patients living long after HTX.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-01-30", "authors": ["DanutaMakowiec", "JoannaWdowczyk", "Zbigniew RStruzik"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01859\n10.1161/01.RES.68.4.1138\n10.1016/j.tcs.2009.12.019\n10.1038/ncomms1705\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.028105\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.11.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130252\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.028104\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1114/1.1553455\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.688889\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.4249/scholarpedia.1868\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1016/j.joa.2016.05.002\n10.22489/CinC.2016.052-487\n10.1063/1.4999605\n10.1137/0134040\n10.1140/epjst/e2012-01695-x\n10.1109/LICS.1996.561342\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00226-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147231.69595.D3\n10.1016/B978-1-4557-2856-5.00028-5\n10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161241\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183727\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02699.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.172403\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112547\n10.1098/rsif.2016.0968\n10.1161/01.RES.74.6.1071\n10.1140/epjb/e2006-00008-2\n10.5506/APhysPolBSupp.7.347\n10.1016/j.chaos.2016.03.024\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00201\n10.1103/PhysRevE.94.042401\n10.1186/1471-2105-11-178\n10.1113/JP271671\n10.1088/0967-3334/37/5/R46\n10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288235\n10.1161/CIRCEP.107.754564\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303466\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s10877-013-9429-6\n10.1136/heart.88.4.406\n10.1136/hrt.2003.031542\n10.1016/j.nahs.2012.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.961524\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043\n10.1161/JAHA.112.001461\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302240\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00079\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00274\n10.1049/iet-syb:20070001\n10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259294"}

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ebselen on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in a rat model and to elucidate the related mechanisms. Myocardial infarct size was assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Myocardial injury was evaluated according to the histopathological and ultrastructural alterations of rat hearts and the serum activity levels of cardiac enzymes, including creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using the terminal dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was measured using western blot analysis. In heart tissue specimens the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) were also detected. The results indicated that ebselen reduced I/R-induced increase in myocardial infarct size and prevented the I/R-induced decreases in ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Further of note, ebselen improved I/R-induced rat heart injury. This was indicated by attenuation of histological and ultrastructural changes; reduction of serum CK, CK-MB and LDH activity levels; and decreased cell apoptosis on TUNEL staining, which was verified by decreased expression of cleaved (C)-Caspase-8, C-Caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and C-PARP, and increased expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, SOD and GPx activity levels were significantly higher, while MDA and PC levels were significantly lower in the ebselen + I/R group compared with in the I/R group.

We consistently found that unipotent germline stem cells, when removed from their niche and cultured in the correct medium endogenously express pluripotency genes, which induce them to become human germline pluripotent stem cells (hgPSCs). These cells are then capable of producing cell types from all three germ layers. Using hgPSCs along with a modified version of a relatively novel cell-expansion culture methodology to induce quick, indefinite expansion of normally slow growing hgPSCs, it was possible to test the potential of cardiomyocytes derived from hgPSCs for treating an ischemic cardiac event. Upon differentiation into cardiac lineages, our data consistently showed that they not only express cardiac genes, but also express cardiac-promoting paracrine factors.

{"title": "A Comparative Study of a 3D Bioprinted Gelatin-Based Lattice and Rectangular-Sheet Structures.", "abstract": "3D bioprinting holds great promise in the field of regenerative medicine as it can create complex structures in a layer-by-layer manner using cell-laden bioinks, making it possible to imitate native tissues. Current bioinks lack both high printability and biocompatibility required in this respect. Hence, the development of bioinks that exhibit both properties is needed. In our previous study, a furfuryl-gelatin-based bioink, crosslinkable by visible light, was used for creating mouse mesenchymal stem cell-laden structures with a high fidelity. In this study, lattice mesh geometries were printed in a comparative study to test against the properties of a traditional rectangular-sheet. After 3D printing and crosslinking, both structures were analysed for swelling and rheological properties, and their porosity was estimated using scanning electron microscopy.

{"title": "Expression of cardiac inwardly rectifying potassium channels in pentylenetetrazole kindling model of epilepsy in rats.", "abstract": "Clinical and experimental studies show that epilepsy affects cardiac function; however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels transport K+ ions into excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes; they control the cell excitability by acting towards the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential. Kir channel expression has been previously shown to vary in epileptic brains, at the same time seizures are known to affect the autonomic nervous system. Kir channel expression in cardiac tissue is a possible mechanism for the explanation of cardiac pathology in epilepsy. We investigate the expression of Kir channels in epileptic cardiac tissue by using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling model in rats. Our molecular analyses showed significant decrease in cardiac Kir channel mRNA and protein expression of PTZ-kindled rats. Interestingly, both Kir2.x, which directs IK1 flux in ventricular tissue and Kir3.x, which is responsible for IKACh in the atria, were observed to decrease significantly. Kir channel expression also differs between females and males. This is the first study to our knowledge in epileptic cardiac tissue showing the expression of Kir channels. Our results show that Kir channels may play a role in cardiac pathology associated with epilepsy.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)", "date": "2019-01-24", "authors": ["EnesAky\u00fcz", "P\u0131narMega Tiber", "MerveBeker", "FahriAkba\u015f"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Clinical Overview of Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus as Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation and Sudden Cardiac Death.", "abstract": "The epidemics of obesity and diabetes mellitus are associated with an increased incidence of both atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Obesity and DM are known to have adverse effects on cardiac structure and function. The pathologic mechanisms are thought to involve cardiac tissue remodeling, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Clinical data suggest that left atrial size, epicardial fat pad thickness, and other modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, glycemic control, and obstructive sleep apnea may mediate the association with AF. Data from human atrial tissue biopsies demonstrate alterations in atrial lipid content and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. With respect to ventricular arrhythmias, abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction are commonly observed in obese and diabetic humans. The increased risk of SCD in this population may also be related to excessive cardiac lipid deposition and insulin resistance. While nutritional interventions have had limited success, perhaps due to poor long-term compliance, weight loss and improved cardiorespiratory fitness may reduce the frequency and severity of AF.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-01-23", "authors": ["Edwin AHoman", "Michael VReyes", "Kathleen THickey", "John PMorrow"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01847\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.08.043\n10.1001/jama.2013.280521\n10.1136/heartjnl-2014-306238\n10.1172/JCI25371\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.10.025\n10.1161/JAHA.112.000102\n10.3109/07853890.2016.1144930\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2018.02.004\n10.1002/clc.23020\n10.1093/ehjqcco/qcw031\n10.1016/S0300-8932(99)74938-9\n10.1172/JCI60329\n10.1001/jama.1994.03510350050036\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.10.946\n10.1186/s12933-014-0123-x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2009.01653.x\n10.3945/ajcn.112.040287\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.04.031\n10.1161/hc4901.101760\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328364fb58\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.5.467\n10.1001/archinte.166.21.2322\n10.1007/s11606-010-1340-y\n10.1002/clc.22967\n10.1053/euhj.1998.1094\n10.1111/j.1542-474X.2007.00150.x\n10.1186/s12872-016-0231-5\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.07.045\n10.1016/j.hlc.2017.05.132\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.08.008\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.01.031\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.08.060\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136587.68725.8E\n10.1056/NEJMoa0802743\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.10.018\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.04.056\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2010.01.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.03.007\n10.1161/01.CIR.67.5.968\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.09.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.009035\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.12.032\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.09.940\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.21.2154\n10.1111/jgs.12085\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145750\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.05.002\n10.1161/hc3201.094151\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16451-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000068337.25994.21\n10.1161/01.CIR.51.4.606\n10.1007/s12170-011-0162-8\n10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303329\n10.1007/s00592-009-0157-9\n10.4022/jafib.502\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.11.034\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023163\n10.1001/jama.1991.03470020057032\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.11.021\n10.1007/s00228-008-0464-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.958306\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.006921\n10.1001/archinte.1987.00370100039008\n10.1097/00019501-199606000-00011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.056309\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.02.050\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000138154.00779.A5\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.03.045\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002525\n10.1136/bmj.316.7133.745\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.015\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.12.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151932\n10.2337/diabetes.53.2.434\n10.1016/S0140-6736(68)92163-6\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005598\n10.1111/j.1462-8902.2004.00358.x\n10.1177/2047487315599892\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.960658\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008201\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.06.488\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.09.028\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.03.002\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31277-6\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.015984\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.7.2455\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003313\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.10.034\n10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.11.024\n10.1016/j.ahj.2016.03.004\n10.1007/s11695-007-9160-9\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.07.028\n10.1001/archinternmed.2010.434\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60443-8\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61774-8\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.06.030\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0803233\n10.1096/fj.04-2263com\n10.1164/ajrccm.160.4.9903020\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309732\n10.1016/S0140-6736(88)90433-3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.10.014\n10.1007/s11606-012-2220-4\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn324\n10.1093/ije/dyv337\n10.1253/circj.71.252\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31258-2\n10.1172/JCI84669\n10.1001/jama.292.20.2471\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.04.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.744466\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00279-8\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2009.09.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031431\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2001.00902.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.11.045\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004378\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.062653\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007805\n10.1177/000331970005100202\n10.1007/s00125-015-3666-9"}

In all specimens, CorMatrix was composed of dense laminated regions of collagen, without appreciable elastin staining. In most grafts, especially those implanted for extended periods of time, tissue with luminal CD31 positivity covered the intimal surface of the CorMatrix graft. This tissue (neo-intima) consisted of spindled myofibroblasts (SMA) and small CD31 positive vessels with occasional mononuclear cells in a matrix composed of collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and rarely elastin, after extended periods of implantation. These features were readily identified in patients as early as 1 month after CorMatrix implantation. The matrix comprising the CorMatrix itself remained largely acellular, despite implantation times up to 2 years, with degradation of the graft material. We provide a framework for histologic expectations when evaluating explanted CorMatrix grafts.

{"title": "Review on Chamber-Specific Differences in Right and Left Heart Reactive Oxygen Species Handling.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) exert signaling character (redox signaling), or damaging character (oxidative stress) on cardiac tissue depending on their concentration and/or reactivity. The steady state of ROS concentration is determined by the interplay between its production (mitochondrial, cytosolic, and sarcolemmal enzymes) and ROS defense enzymes (mitochondria, cytosol). Recent studies suggest that ROS regulation is different in the left and right ventricle of the heart, specifically by a different activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Mitochondrial ROS defense seems to be lower in right ventricular tissue compared to left ventricular tissue. In this review we summarize the current evidence for heart chamber specific differences in ROS regulation that may play a major role in an observed inability of the right ventricle to compensate for cardiac stress such as pulmonary hypertension. Based on the current knowledge regimes to increase ROS defense in right ventricular tissue should be in the focus for the development of future therapies concerning right heart failure.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-01-09", "authors": ["Klaus-DieterSchl\u00fcter", "Hanna SarahKutsche", "ChristineHirschh\u00e4user", "RolfSchreckenberg", "RainerSchulz"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01799\n10.3317/jraas.2003.003\n10.1152/ajplung.00258.2016\n10.1152/ajpheart.00746.2012\n10.1007/s10741-016-9566-3\n10.14670/HH-11-932\n10.5402/2011/430549\n10.4172/2161-105X.1000241\n10.1186/s12931-015-0178-6\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.014\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.019351\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.222703\n10.1161/01.RES.0000099504.30207.F5\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.05.019\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.01.007\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.06.058\n10.1007/s10557-013-6458-9\n10.1155/2016/4682786\n10.1155/2017/2624384\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.006\n10.1038/aps.2013.185\n10.1038/aps.2009.104\n10.1007/s00424-011-1020-8\n10.2174/187152911798347025\n10.1152/ajpheart.00153.2017\n10.1152/ajpheart.01140.2011\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.03.011\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01826-5\n10.1152/ajplung.00176.2014\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1240\n10.1152/ajpheart.00953.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312708\n10.1111/bph.13478\n10.1111/bph.13948\n10.1155/2017/9036450\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209643\n10.1097/01.hdx.0000089836.03515.a9\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.05.007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00977.2012\n10.1016/j.biocel.2014.08.012\n10.1007/s11010-018-3355-3\n10.1152/ajpheart.00007.2013\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.966127\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.051\n10.1152/ajpheart.00286.2007\n10.1155/2017/534397\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.06.002\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2015.09.001\n10.1210/endo-meetings.2011.PART4.P2.P3-440\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.05.005\n10.1016/j.jash.2017.03.008\n10.2174/0929867324666170329100619\n10.1152/ajpheart.01034.2009\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00793.x\n10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308348\n10.1161/01.RES.88.5.529\n10.1253/circj.69.617\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.961474\n10.1152/ajpheart.00595.2012\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000032031.30374.32\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030352\n10.1691/ph.2013.2782\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.12.028\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000082\n10.1139/Y10-063\n10.1152/ajplung.00135.2005\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.06.008\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.2009.05198.x\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00744.2009\n10.1089/ars.2009.2940\n10.1155/2016/6578578\n10.2741/4396\n10.1111/bph.13721\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173030\n10.1155/2016/4375418\n10.5551/jat.27292\n10.21037/atm.2017.06.17\n10.1152/ajpheart.00182.2015\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.01.040\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.01.009\n10.1165/2008-0145OC\n10.1152/ajpheart.00169.2012\n10.1093/jn/138.9.1596\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.301130\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00121.2011\n10.1023/a:1006914111957\n10.1007/s002100100469\n10.1007/s11010-017-2995-z\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.112\n10.1152/ajpheart.00084.2014\n10.1152/ajpheart.00777.2011\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl096\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03261\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.012975\n10.1152/ajpheart.00097.2009\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.05.012\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.09.012\n10.1155/2017/6819281\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.05.024\n10.1016/S1388-9842(02)00016-8\n10.1007/978-3-319-31251-4_1\n10.1089/ars.2014.6139\n10.3892/ijmm.2013.1236\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0768\n10.1139/cjpp-2016-0445\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.07.003\n10.1172/JCI39162\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.01.004\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002555\n10.1172/JCI21968\n10.1152/ajpheart.00868.2010\n10.1291/hypres.28.67\n10.1097/00005344-200106000-00010\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.04.001\n10.1291/hypres.27.877\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.08.010\n10.1080/14728222.2017.1311864\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176887\n10.1165/rcmb.2013-0191OC\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.02.004\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000250468.02084.ce\n10.1096/fj.00-0827fje\n10.1089/ars.2012.4568\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.111.962381\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01043.x\n10.1152/ajplung.00356.2015\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.02.016\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.17.1735"}

In viable CMCs, mitochondrial respiration was preserved in both CMCs cultured alone and in CMCs co-cultured with MSCs. Comparison of cellular contractility and calcium handling, measured in single CMCs, revealed no significant differences between viable CMCs from co-culture and CMCs cultured alone.

{"title": "Design and Construction of A Laser-Based Respiratory Gating System For Implementation of Deep Inspiration Breathe Hold Technique in Radiotherapy Clinics.", "abstract": "Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is known as a radiotherapy method for the treatment of patients with left-sided breast cancer. In this method, patient is under exposure only while he/she is at the end of a deep inspiration cycle and holds his/her breath. In this situation, the volume of the lung tissue is enhanced and the heart tissue is pushed away from the treating breast. Therefore, heart dose of these patients, using DIBH, experiences a considerable decline compared to free breathing treatment. There are a few commercialized systems for implementation of DIBH in invasive or noninvasive manners.\nWe present a novel constructed noninvasive DIBH device relied on a manufacturing near-field laser distance meter. This in-house constructed system is composed of a CD22-100AM122 laser sensor combined with a data acquisition system for monitoring the breathing curve. Qt Creator (a cross-platform JavaScript, QML, and C++-integrated development environment that is part of the SDK for development of the Qt Graphical User Interface application framework) and Keil MDK-ARM (a programming software where users can write in C and C++ and assemble for ARM-based microcontrollers) are used for composing computer and microcontroller programs, respectively.\nThis system could be mounted in treatment or computed tomography (CT) room at suitable cost; it is also easy to use and needs a little training for personnel and patients. The system can assess the location of chest wall or abdomen in real time with high precision and frequency. The performance of CD22-100AM122 demonstrates promise for respiratory monitoring for its fast sampling rate as well as high precision. It can also deliver reasonable spatial and temporal accuracy. The patient observes his/her breathing waveform through a 7\" 1024 \u00d7 600 liquid crystal display and gets some instructions during treatment and CT sessions by an exploited algorithm called \"interaction scenario\" in this study. The system is also noninvasive and well sustainable for patients.\nThe constructed system has true real-time operation and is rapid enough for delivering clear contiguous monitoring. In addition, in this system, we have provided an interaction scenario option between patient and CT or Linac operator. In addition, the constructed system has the capability of sending triggers for turning on and off CT or Linac facilities. In this concern, the system has the superiority of combining a plenty of characteristics.", "journal": "Journal of medical signals and sensors", "date": "2019-01-04", "authors": ["Mohammad Javad KeikhaiFarzaneh", "ShahrokhNasseri", "MehdiMomennezhad", "RohamSalek"], "doi": "10.4103/jmss.JMSS_35_18"}

(SP) have been widely used to treat extra \"He-Yi\" induced myocardial ischemia for hundreds of years in Inner Mongolia, China and previous result showed that intragastric pretreatment with total extract (T) of SP has a protective effect against myocardial infarction (MI).\nThis study aims to describe the pharmacological investigation and chemical characterization of the major (M) and minor (N) fractions obtained from T through column chromatography fractionation on macroporous resin and to explore whether the regulatory effects were linked to the p53-mediated apoptosis pathways.\nLeft anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery-ligated mice and H9c2 cells cultured in serum-free medium under hypoxic conditions were treated with T, M, and N.\nEchocardiography was performed and biomarkers in serum were determined in mice, and pathological changes were observed through histopathology assay. Immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression levels of p53 in heart tissue. Flow cytometry was used to measure the level of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in H9c2 cells. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect p53 and p53-mediated proteins apoptosis pathways of in both tissue and H9c2 cells.\nBoth T and M have an equivalent cardioprotective effect whereas N is non-active. M decreased MI-induced myocardial compensatory expansion by decrease of left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESd) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd) and prevented decreases in ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS). The MI-induced increased levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were decreased and the expanded infarction size was reduced. M could also improve cell viability and inhibit apoptosis in H9c2 cells under hypoxic conditions. Immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR assay showed that M suppressed p53 expression in the myocardium. Western blot analysis showed that M could prevent MI-induced activation of p53-mediated apoptosis pathway in both myocardium and H9c2 cells.\nThe results demonstrated that M may protect against myocardial ischemia by improving cardiac function and inhibiting cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Overall, the present findings supported the clinical application of SP and enriched the research of anti-myocardial ischemia drug from traditional medicines.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2019-01-03", "authors": ["XiaoFeng", "RuifeiZhang", "JunjunLi", "YuanCao", "FengZhao", "XiaolangDu", "XiaoliGao", "LanCao", "SuyileChen", "PengfeiTu", "XingyunChai"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.188"}

One potential therapeutic strategy is to enhance proliferation of resident cardiomyocytes. However, phenotypic screening for therapeutic agents is challenged by the limited ability of conventional markers to discriminate between cardiomyocyte proliferation and endoreplication (e.g. polyploidy and multinucleation). Here, we developed a novel assay that combines automated live-cell microscopy and image processing algorithms to discriminate between proliferation and endoreplication by quantifying changes in the number of nuclei, changes in the number of cells, binucleation, and nuclear DNA content. We applied this assay to further prioritize hits from a primary screen for DNA synthesis, identifying 30 compounds that enhance proliferation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Among the most active compounds from the phenotypic screen are clinically approved L-type calcium channel blockers from multiple chemical classes whose activities were confirmed across different sources of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

Traditional pharmacological treatments can delay but cannot reverse the underlying disease processes. The clinical application of myocardial tissue engineering represents a promising strategy because it features cell-based replacement therapies that replace partially or fully damaged cardiac tissues with in vitro-generated tissue equivalents. However, the effectiveness of this therapy is limited by poor viability and differentiation of the grafted cells. This limitation could be overcome by rapidly increasing the numbers of functional cardiomyocytes. In this study, we aimed to obtain functional myocardial tissue engineering seed cells with high proliferation and differentiation rates by combining 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethan-olamine-polyethylene glycol (DMPE-PEG) and recombinant transforming growth factor-\u03b21 receptor I (rTGF-\u03b21 RI), followed by binding to human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs).\nTo induce higher expression level of TGF-\u03b21 RI, DMPE-PEG was inoculated with rTGF-\u03b21 RI to modify the surface of hADSCs. The differentiation ability and morphological characteristics of the modified hADSCs were examined in vitro and in vivo.\nThe caridiomyocartic differentiation ability of TGF-\u03b21 RI-modified hADSCs was significantly enhanced, as indicated by elevated expression levels of the cardiac markers cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) via increased phosphorylation of the Smad signaling pathway-related proteins.\nOur findings provide new insights into stem cell transplantation therapy in myocardial tissue engineering.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2018-12-31", "authors": ["FeiZhang", "YuanXie", "YuhaoBian"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-018-1090-z\n10.1038/ncpcardio0444\n10.1586/erd.10.78\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.01.021\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.05.121\n10.1002/cbf.1488\n10.1002/term.2255\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.010\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.01.026\n10.1007/s10529-014-1637-8\n10.1186/s13287-017-0695-y\n10.1002/cbf.1547\n10.1021/acsomega.7b01886\n10.1002/jcp.20977\n10.1590/S1807-59322011000200021\n10.1039/C6CS00052E\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.06.001\n10.3727/096368912X654966\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0042"}
{"title": "\u03b2-PVDF based electrospun nanofibers - A promising material for developing cardiac patches.", "abstract": "Necrosis in heart muscles can permanently hinder the natural healthy rhythm of heart pumping mechanism. The damaged muscular tissues are replaced by scar tissues and burdens the healthy muscles resulting in further attenuated functioning of heart. Since, human heart muscles cannot regenerate naturally or it has been thought so, pharmacological procedures such as using a heart assist device are followed to restore the lost function of heart. Stem cell engineering and cardiac patches offers promising prospects with their cutting edge research reports. Cardiac patches offers a viable solution as they can also function as an implant to assist in offering the mechanical support the damaged muscles were capable of. Designing cardiac patches to suit multiple functions is not only challenging but also perilous due to the target organ with which it will be interfaced. Sensor based, electrically active, miniaturized circuitry etc., poses a huge threat to the individual in whom the device/patch is implanted. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis on choosing \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposites as the inimitable material for designing implantable cardiac patches. \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposite materials is expected to exhibit piezoelectric effect and contribute to the adherence, proliferation and maturation of stem cells. Physico-chemical characterizations followed by in vitro cell line studies were performed in ought to confirm the same. The results revealed that the \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposite material was mechanically stable and supportive in cardiomyocyte adherence and differentiation when compared to standard non piezoelectric scaffolds (control).

In APEC E058 (O2 serogroup), there are two copies of the outer membrane protease (ompT) gene, compT encoding cOmpT that is located on the chromosome and pompT encoding pOmpT that is located on a ColV plasmid. However, the relationship between pathogenesis and pompT expression in APEC E058 has yet to be elucidated. Here, we successfully constructed two pompT gene mutants: E058\u0394pompT containing a chloramphenicol (cat) resistance gene and E058\u0394pompT' without the cat gene. By RT-PCR and sequencing analysis, an unexpected transcriptome pompT' was detected in mutant strain E058\u0394pompT' after deletion of the cat gene induced by the lambda red recombination system. Surprisingly, the pathogenicity of mutant E058\u0394pompT was significantly attenuated compared to its parental strain in the chicken infection model and HD11 cell model then the pompT gene was knocked out, while the pathogenicity of the other mutant strain E058\u0394pompT' had no difference. Furthermore, the presence of unexpected transcriptome pompT' influenced the bactericidal activity of SPF chicken serum and decreased the transcription level of TLR2 in the heart tissue of chickens. Our study identifies the pompT gene plays an important role in the virulence of APEC E058, and the unexpected transcriptome pompT' contributes to the increased pathogenicity of APEC E058 mutants following deletion of the cat gene induced by the lambda red recombination system, which suggests that this system still has some limitations for construction of mutant strains particularly where these are used in development of live vaccine.", "journal": "Veterinary microbiology", "date": "2018-12-30", "authors": ["JuanhuaLiu", "XiaohuiMu", "XiaoboWang", "HaixiaHuan", "QingqingGao", "JuanChen", "PeizhuangQiao", "LuyaoJiang", "SongGao", "XiufanLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.11.011"}

SPJ groups were given SPJ at different doses (10, 60 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9) consecutively for 6 months, meanwhile, aging model group was treated with the equal volume of saline for 6 months until 24 months old. Another 10 rats aged 6 month were used as young control group. The changes of myocardial morphological were observed by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining.

Maoberry extract remarkably ameliorated the expressions of genes involved with pro-inflammatory such as the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).\nOur findings suggest that maoberry extract has remarkable effects on preventing progression of cardiac tissue deterioration at least through lowering oxidative stress and inflammation.", "journal": "BMC complementary and alternative medicine", "date": "2018-12-29", "authors": ["ArunwanUdomkasemsab", "ChattrayaNgamlerst", "PoomAdisakwattana", "AmornratAroonnual", "RungsunnTungtrongchitr", "PattaneeyaPrangthip"], "doi": "10.1186/s12906-018-2400-9\n10.1002/biof.1024\n10.1016/j.rec.2014.04.021\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00897.x\n10.1016/j.jfda.2016.11.006\n10.1016/j.redox.2013.07.006\n10.1179/174329211X13049558293713\n10.1016/j.redox.2014.07.001\n10.1038/ni.2001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036785\n10.1155/2013/708381\n10.1017/S0007114509382148\n10.1007/s00394-010-0092-0\n10.3109/09637486.2014.880672\n10.1016/j.tem.2013.10.002\n10.3923/pjbs.2008.1654.1661\n10.1155/2015/956298\n10.1016/j.jtusci.2014.11.001\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.02.093\n10.3923/pjbs.2008.996.1002\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.10.022\n10.1007/s10238-011-0165-2\n10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2011.07.010\n10.1002/mnfr.201700482\n10.1039/C4FO00211C\n10.1016/j.jsps.2012.05.002\n10.1155/2015/905215\n10.1186/1472-6882-14-395\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.02.012\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00441\n10.1002/mnfr.200900504\n10.1007/s11883-013-0324-x\n10.2174/138161212802002760\n10.4162/nrp.2011.5.5.381\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.04.007\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000109171.50229.33\n10.1002/bies.20769"}

Here, a novel cellular mechanical visualizable biosensor formed by assembling engineered cardiac tissues on the Morpho butterfly wings is presented. The assembled cardiomyocytes benefit from the periodic parallel nanoridges of the wings and can recover their autonomic beating ability with guided cellular orientation and good contraction performance. As the beating processes are accompanied by the cardiomyocytes' elongation and contraction, the elastic butterfly wing substrate undergoes the same cycle of deformations, which causes corresponding synchronous shifts in their structural colors and photonic bandgaps for self-reporting of the cell mechanics. It is demonstrated that this self-reporting performance can be further improved by adding oriented carbon nanotubes in the nanoridges of the wings for the culture. In addition, taking advantage of the similar size of the cardiomyocyte and a single Morpho wing scale, the investigation of single-cell-level mechanics can be realized by detecting the optical performance of a single scale.

{"title": "Transcriptional Programs and Regeneration Enhancers Underlying Heart Regeneration.", "abstract": "The heart plays the vital role of propelling blood to the entire body, which is essential to life. While maintaining heart function is critical, adult mammalian hearts poorly regenerate damaged cardiac tissue upon injury and form scar tissue instead. Unlike adult mammals, adult zebrafish can regenerate injured hearts with no sign of scarring, making zebrafish an ideal model system with which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying heart regeneration. Investigation of heart regeneration in zebrafish together with mice has revealed multiple cardiac regeneration genes that are induced by injury to facilitate heart regeneration. Altered expression of these regeneration genes in adult mammals is one of the main causes of heart regeneration failure. Previous studies have focused on the roles of these regeneration genes, yet the regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of cardiac regeneration genes is precisely controlled are largely unknown.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 135 CHD patients and 45 chest tightness or chest pain patients (control group). Basic clinical data and serum 25-OH-VD, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2 of the 2 groups were compared by SPSS 25.0. A CHD rat model was used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. RESULTS The serum 25-OH-VD level in the control group was significantly higher compared to the CHD group, and decreased with the worsening of the CHD condition. Logistic regression found that serum 25-OH-VD was a protective factor in the occurrence of CHD. In CHD patients, the level of serum 25-OH-VD had a negative correlation with serum TNF-\u03b1 (r=-0.651, P<0.001), IL-6 (r=-0.457, P<0.001), IL-8 (r=-0.755, P<0.001), and IL-1\u03b2 (r=-0.628, P<0.001). In animal experiments, VD deficiency enhanced the level of serum TC, TG, and LDL-C. VD deficiency could increase the inflammatory response by upregulating the expression of p65 protein and reducing SIRT1 protein expression in heart tissue, thereby inducing or aggravating the state of CHD.

However, it is still unclear the molecular mechanism revealing the progression of the disease. In the study, we illustrated that the expression of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4), associated with the pathological development of various inflammatory diseases, was down-regulated in pressure overload-induced hearts of patients and mice. LILRB4-knockout mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure by promoting cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis. Mechanistically, transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) expression was significantly promoted by LILRB4 deficiency in hearts of mice after aortic banding (AB) surgery. AB-induced inflammation in cardiac tissues was accelerated by LILRB4 deletion through elevating nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. Furthermore, apoptosis triggered by AB operation in heart tissues was markedly enhanced in LILRB4-KO mice through promoting Caspase-3 activation. Importantly, the in\u00a0vitro study indicated that LILRB4 knockdown-promoted fibrosis; inflammation and apoptosis were largely via the NF-\u03baB signaling.

Here, we aim to systemically explore the immunomodulatory ability of herbal ingredients on the human heart tissue-specific immune dysfunction through a network pharmacology based approach. The approach matches gene expression data between herbal ingredients and human heart phenotype based on their immunological similarities. Firstly, 608 immunological signatures were produced from 304 transcriptional profiles of immunological cell state changes. Then, the immunological features of 28 human heart phenotypes and 102 herbal ingredients were constructed by calculating the enrichments of each immune signature in the transcriptional profiles of heart phenotypes and herbal ingredients, respectively. Finally, the likelihood that an herbal drug affects the immune system in a heart phenotype was qualified by calculating the immunological similarity between the herbal drug and the heart phenotype.

{"title": "3D printed micro-scale force gauge arrays to improve human cardiac tissue maturation and enable high throughput drug testing.", "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are regarded as a promising cell source for establishing in-vitro personalized cardiac tissue models and developing therapeutics. However, analyzing cardiac force and drug response using mature human iPSC-CMs in a high-throughput format still remains a great challenge. Here we describe a rapid light-based 3D printing system for fabricating micro-scale force gauge arrays suitable for 24-well and 96-well plates that enable scalable tissue formation and measurement of cardiac force generation in human iPSC-CMs. We demonstrate consistent tissue band formation around the force gauge pillars with aligned sarcomeres. Among the different maturation treatment protocols we explored, 3D aligned cultures on force gauge arrays with in-culture pacing produced the highest expression of mature cardiac marker genes. We further demonstrated the utility of these micro-tissues to develop significantly increased contractile forces in response to treatment with isoproterenol, levosimendan, and omecamtiv mecarbil. Overall, this new 3D printing system allows for high flexibility in force gauge design and can be optimized to achieve miniaturization and promote cardiac tissue maturation with great potential for high-throughput in-vitro drug screening applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The application of iPSC-derived cardiac tissues in translatable drug screening is currently limited by the challenges in forming mature cardiac tissue and analyzing cardiac forces in a high-throughput format. We demonstrate the use of a rapid light-based 3D printing system to build a micro-scale force gauge array that enables scalable cardiac tissue formation from iPSC-CMs and measurement of contractile force development. With the capability to provide great flexibility over force gauge design as well as optimization to achieve miniaturization, our 3D printing system serves as a promising tool to build cardiac tissues for high-throughput in-vitro drug screening applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2018-12-24", "authors": ["XuanyiMa", "SukritiDewan", "JustinLiu", "MinTang", "Kathleen LMiller", "ClaireYu", "NatalieLawrence", "Andrew DMcCulloch", "ShaochenChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2018.12.026\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.1326\n10.4172/2168-9547.1000193\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014092\n10.1016/J.BBAMCR.2016.03.003\n10.1016/J.BIOTECHADV.2016.12.002\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00080\n10.1007/s10557-017-6735-0\n10.1038/srep45641\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00050\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.058\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1007/s12265-013-9510-z\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.2144/000114245\n10.1364/OL.35.001602\n10.1039/C5LC00159E\n10.1073/pnas.1524510113\n10.1016/j.copbio.2016.03.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.042\n10.1002/bit.24957\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.09.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0179452\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.023\n10.1115/1.3630093\n10.1007/978-90-481-2516-6_5\n10.1002/9780470846087\n10.1093/cvr/cvm099\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.009\n10.1007/978-1-4419-6658-2_16\n10.1007/s10544-013-9812-6\n10.1038/ncomms4774\n10.1002/adma.201501372\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0341\n10.7150/thno.19441\n10.1177/1074248414536273\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.009\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05091.x\n10.1038/ncb1001-867\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1115/1.4027145\n10.1136/heart.86.1.81\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0677\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000286\n10.1111/bph.13235"}
{"title": "High Modulus Conductive Hydrogels Enhance In Vitro Maturation and Contractile Function of Primary Cardiomyocytes for Uses in Drug Screening.", "abstract": "Effective and quick screening and cardiotoxicity assessment are very crucial for drug development. Here, a novel composite hydrogel composed of carbon fibers (CFs) with high conductivity and modulus with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is reported. The conductivity of the composite hydrogel PVA/CFs is similar to that of natural heart tissue, and the elastic modulus is close to that of natural heart tissue during systole, due to the incorporation of CFs. PVA/CFs remarkably enhance the maturation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) in vitro by upregulating the expression of \u03b1-actinin, troponin T, and connexin-43, activating the signaling pathway of \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin-dependent ILK/p-AKT, and increasing the level of RhoA and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1. As a result, the engineered cell sheet-like constructs NRCM@PVA/CFs display much more synchronous, stable, and robust beating behavior than NRCM@PVA. When exposed to doxorubicin or isoprenaline, NRCM@PVA/CFs can retain effective beating for much longer time or change the contractile rate much faster than NRCM@PVA, respectively, therefore representing a promising heart-like platform for in vitro drug screening and cardiotoxicity assessment.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2018-12-20", "authors": ["FengxinWu", "AijunGao", "JianLiu", "YaoyiShen", "PanpanXu", "JieMeng", "TaoWen", "LianghuaXu", "HaiyanXu"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201800990"}
{"title": "Competing Mechanisms of Stress-Assisted Diffusivity and Stretch-Activated Currents in Cardiac Electromechanics.", "abstract": "We numerically investigate the role of mechanical stress in modifying the conductivity properties of cardiac tissue, and also assess the impact of these effects in the solutions generated by computational models for cardiac electromechanics. We follow the recent theoretical framework from Cherubini et al. (2017), proposed in the context of general reaction-diffusion-mechanics systems emerging from multiphysics continuum mechanics and finite elasticity. In the present study, the adapted models are compared against preliminary experimental data of pig right ventricle fluorescence optical mapping. These data contribute to the characterization of the observed inhomogeneity and anisotropy properties that result from mechanical deformation. Our novel approach simultaneously incorporates two mechanisms for mechano-electric feedback (MEF): stretch-activated currents (SAC) and stress-assisted diffusion (SAD); and we also identify their influence into the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics. It is found that (i) only specific combinations of the two MEF effects allow proper conduction velocity measurement; (ii) expected heterogeneities and anisotropies are obtained via the novel stress-assisted diffusion mechanisms; (iii) spiral wave meandering and drifting is highly mediated by the applied mechanical loading. We provide an analysis of the intrinsic structure of the nonlinear coupling mechanisms using computational tests conducted with finite element methods. In particular, we compare static and dynamic deformation regimes in the onset of cardiac arrhythmias and address other potential biomedical applications.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2018-12-19", "authors": ["AlessandroLoppini", "AlessioGizzi", "RicardoRuiz-Baier", "ChristianCherubini", "Flavio HFenton", "SimonettaFilippi"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01714\n10.1007/BF01202949\n10.11588/ans.2015.100.20553\n10.1007/s10659-011-9351-4\n10.1016/j.jcp.2015.10.045\n10.1063/1.5001454\n10.4208/cicp.240909.170210a\n10.1002/zamm.201800166\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00483\n10.1063/1.4886356\n10.1088/1367-2630/10/12/125016\n10.1103/PhysRevE.85.031915\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.07.013\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2008.02.001\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.1016/j.cma.2017.03.015\n10.1007/s11012-016-0472-5\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00424\n10.1088/1367-2630/17/4/043055\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.481\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.05.026\n10.1016/j.cma.2018.03.043\n10.3389/fgene.2014.00083\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00071\n10.4208/cicp.091213.260614a\n10.1088/1361-6579/aa64af\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2015.09.008\n10.1007/s10665-017-9943-5\n10.1103/PhysRevE.86.031912\n10.1038/s41598-017-08011-z\n10.1016/j.cma.2015.11.014\n10.1103/PhysRevE.86.036205\n10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-020911-125112\n10.1152/ajpheart.00862.2009\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00404\n10.1002/cnm.1494\n10.1098/rspa.2015.0641\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.03.008\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2018.06.001\n10.1209/0295-5075/104/58005\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.05.003\n10.1007/s10237-015-0737-2\n10.1002/cnm.1468\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.06.001\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.01.038\n10.1007/s11012-017-0622-4\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.258104\n10.1016/j.cma.2016.05.031\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.05.003\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.06.007\n10.1016/S0079-6107(03)00011-7\n10.1007/s10439-018-2007-9\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2013.10.009\n10.1016/j.jcp.2015.07.018\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00539\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.12.030\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.06.013\n10.1016/j.jmps.2016.05.018\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.08.008\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00043\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00819\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.02.027\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.12.001\n10.1530/REP-16-0156"}

Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is common in clinical practice, while its mechanism is unknown. It has been proved that lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 may promote doxorubicin resistance and WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1) blocks doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte death. Our study aimed to investigate the involvement of lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to explore their interactions. In our study we observed that FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 mRNA were downregulated in heart tissues of mice with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 mRNA expression were positively correlated in mice with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity but not in healthy mice. Overexpression of FOXC2-AS1 promoted to viability of mice cardiomyocytes under Dox treatment and also increased the expression level of WISP1. In contrast, WISP1 overexpression showed no significant effect on FOXC2-AS1. We therefore conclude that lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 may upregulate WISP1 to protect cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry", "date": "2018-12-19", "authors": ["ShenweiZhang", "YiqiangYuan", "ZhengZhang", "JingGuo", "JingLi", "KuiZhao", "YanpingQin", "ChunguangQiu"], "doi": "10.1080/09168451.2018.1553606"}
{"title": "Fabrication of scaffold-free tubular cardiac constructs using a Bio-3D printer.", "abstract": "A major challenge in cardiac tissue engineering is the host's immune response to artificial materials. To overcome this problem, we established a scaffold-free system for assembling cell constructs using an automated Bio-3D printer. This printer has previously been used to fabricate other three-dimensional (3D) constructs, including liver, blood vessels, and cartilage. In the present study, we tested the function in vivo of scaffold-free cardiac tubular construct fabricated using this system. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iCells), endothelial cells, and fibroblasts were combined to make the spheroids. Subsequently, tubular cardiac constructs were fabricated by Bio-3D printer placing the spheroids on a needle array. Notably, the spheroid fusion and beat rate in the constructs were observed while still on the needle array. After removal from the needle array, electrical stimulation was used to test responsiveness of the constructs. An increased beat rate was observed during stimulation. Importantly, the constructs returned to their initial beat rate after stimulation was stopped. In addition, histological analysis shows cellular reorganization occurring in the cardiac constructs, which may mimic that observed during organ transplantation. Taken together, our results indicate that these engineered cardiac tubular constructs, which address both the limited supply of donor tissues as well as the immune-induced transplant rejection, has potential to be used for both clinical and drug testing applications.

{"title": "Approaches to therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is caused by the narrowing of arteries that work to provide blood, nutrients, and oxygen to the myocardial tissue. The worldwide epidemic of IHD urgently requires innovative treatments despite the significant advances in medical, interventional, and surgical therapies for this disease. Angiogenesis is a physiological and pathophysiological process that initiates vascular growth from pre-existing blood vessels in response to a lack of oxygen. This process occurs naturally over time and has encouraged researchers and clinicians to investigate the outcomes of accelerating or enhancing this angiogenic response as an alternative IHD therapy. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been shown to revascularize ischemic heart tissue, reduce the progression of tissue infarction, and evade the need for invasive surgical procedures or tissue/organ transplants. Several approaches, including the use of proteins, genes, stem/progenitor cells, and various combinations, have been employed to promote angiogenesis.

Hulten (G. acuta) has been widely used in Mongolian medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in Ewenki and Oroqen, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and related mechanism of G. acuta on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the normal control group, ISO induced group and ISO+G. acuta treatment group. Rats were administered with ISO subcutaneously (5\u202fmg/kg/day) for 7 days, and were orally administered simultaneously with aqueous extracts of G. acuta for 21 days. This investigation showed G. acuta treatment ameliorated cardiac structural disorder, excessive collagenous fiber accumulation and cardiac malfunction. Compared with the ISO induced model group, G. acuta treatment increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and glutathione (GSH) level, prevented the rise of malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased hydroxyproline contents in the heart tissues. Moreover, G. acuta reduced the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and inhibited the expression and activation of NF-\u03baB-P65 in myocardial tissues. These results suggested that G. acuta protects against ISO-induced cardiac malfunction probably by preventing oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and the mechanism might be through inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathway.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-12-17", "authors": ["Ai-YingLi", "Jing-JingWang", "Sheng-ChangYang", "Ya-ShuoZhao", "Jie-RuLi", "YuLiu", "Jia-HuanSun", "Li-PingAn", "PengGuan", "En-ShengJi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.029"}

Gemfibrozil (GEM) is a lipid-lowering drug with a number of biological properties such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Therefore, we decided to investigate the effect of GEM on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Twenty-eight adult male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups as follows: Group I received normal saline (2\u2009ml/kg) orally for 14 days, group II received DOX (2.5\u2009mg/kg; in six injections; accumulative dose: 15\u2009mg/kg) intraperitonially for 14 days, group III received DOX\u2009+\u2009GEM (100\u2009mg/kg) orally for 14 days concomitantly with DOX administration, and group IV received GEM orally for 14 days. Lipid panel, various biochemical biomarkers, and histological observations were evaluated in serum and heart samples. According to our results, DOX significantly increased the levels of lipid panel (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteins cholesterol) as well as markers of cardiac dysfunction (Aspartate aminotransferase, Creatine kinase-muscle/brain, Lactate dehydrogenase and Cardiac Troponin I). Moreover, DOX significantly increased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, administration of DOX reduced the level of glutathione as well as the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and Glutathione peroxidase activities. DOX-treated rats showed significantly higher tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2. GEM administration significantly attenuated the lipid panel and biochemical biomarkers in DOX-treated rats. Our results were confirmed by histopathological evaluations of the heart. Based on our findings, GEM is a promising cardioprotective agent in patients treated with DOX through mitigative effects on biochemical markers and oxidative stress indices.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-12-16", "authors": ["HabibHaybar", "MehdiGoudarzi", "SaeedMehrzadi", "AzadehAminzadeh", "Mohammad JavadKhodayar", "MojtabaKalantar", "ImanFatemi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.101"}

{"title": "Recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist treatment protects rats from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "The interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling pathway plays a vital role in multiple mechanisms associated with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, including inflammation and apoptosis. An IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) can block IL-1 by competitive binding to the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and thus may provide a cardioprotective effect. In the present investigation, we determined whether exogenous administration of recombinant human IL-1Ra (rhIL-1Ra) provides a protective role against myocardial I/R injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical coronary artery ligation (or sham operation) by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for 30\u2009min followed by reperfusion. After 30\u2009min of reperfusion, a 2\u2009mg/kg dose of rhIL-1Ra was injected subcutaneously. This was followed up with once daily injections for seven days. Echocardiography revealed that ejection fraction (EF) values were significantly greater in the rhIL-1Ra-treated animals. RhIL-1Ra was found to reduce the severity of myocardial injury and increase the viability of the cardiac tissue. There was found to be less IL-1\u03b2 expression in rhIL-1Ra-treated animals than in controls. These results provide compelling data to suggest administration of IL-1Ra could have a significant cardioprotective effect against myocardial I/R injury and thus IL-1Ra could emerge as a potential clinical drug for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-12-15", "authors": ["JinzhouZhu", "JiannanHuang", "DaopengDai", "XiaWang", "JingGao", "WeiHan", "RuiyanZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.031"}
{"title": "Drp1/Fis1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation leads to lysosomal dysfunction in cardiac models of Huntington's disease.", "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, best known for its clinical triad of progressive motor impairment, cognitive deficits and psychiatric disturbances, is caused by CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of Huntingtin (HTT). However, in addition to the neurological disease, mutant HTT (mHTT), which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, impairs other organ systems. Not surprisingly, cardiovascular dysautonomia as well as the deterioration of circadian rhythms are among the earliest detectable pathophysiological changes in individuals with HD. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain and skeletal muscle in HD has been well documented, as the disease progresses. However, not much is known about mitochondrial abnormalities in the heart. In this study, we describe a role for Drp1/Fis1-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission and dysfunction, associated with lysosomal dysfunction in H9C2 expressing long polyglutamine repeat (Q73) and in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes transfected with Q77. Expression of long polyglutamine repeat led to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial fragmentation. We observed an increased accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the lysosome that was coupled with lysosomal dysfunction. Importantly, reducing Drp1/Fis1-mediated mitochondrial damage significantly improved mitochondrial function and cell survival. Finally, reducing Fis1-mediated Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria, using the selective inhibitor of this interaction, P110, improved mitochondrial structure in the cardiac tissue of R6/2 mice. We suggest that drugs focusing on the central nervous system will not address mitochondrial function across all organs, and therefore will not be a sufficient strategy to treat or slow down HD disease progression.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-12-15", "authors": ["A UJoshi", "A EEbert", "BHaileselassie", "DMochly-Rosen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.12.004"}

But there is still enthusiasm for increasing cGMP in patients with HF, which highlight the need to determine the expression of PDEs in cardiac muscle. This study used immunoblotting to examine the expression of the PDEs that have been suggested to be targets for therapy of HF in both canines (normal and HFpEF) and humans (normal and HFrEF). Our results demonstrate PDE1C and PDE3A are expressed in cardiac muscle, but we could not detect the expression of PDE2A, PDE5A, PDE7A and PDE9A in cardiac tissue lysates from either normal or failing hearts.

Mounting evidence supports the theory that paracrine products are the main contributors to the regenerative effects attributed to these cell therapies. The next generation of cell-based MI therapies will identify and isolate cell products and derivatives, integrate them with biocompatible materials and technologies, and use them for the regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue.

{"title": "Proteasomal Protein Degradation: Adaptation of Cellular Proteolysis With Impact on Virus-and Cytokine-Mediated Damage of Heart Tissue During Myocarditis.", "abstract": "Viral myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle triggered by direct virus-induced cytolysis and immune response mechanisms with most severe consequences during early childhood. Acute and long-term manifestation of damaged heart tissue and disturbances of cardiac performance involve virus-triggered adverse activation of the immune response and both immunopathology, as well as, autoimmunity account for such immune-destructive processes. It is a matter of ongoing debate to what extent subclinical virus infection contributes to the debilitating sequela of the acute disease. In this review, we conceptualize the many functions of the proteasome in viral myocarditis and discuss the adaptation of this multi-catalytic protease complex together with its implications on the course of disease. Inhibition of proteasome function is already highly relevant as a strategy in treating various malignancies. However, cardiotoxicity and immune-related adverse effects have proven significant hurdles, representative of the target's wide-ranging functions. Thus, we further discuss the molecular details of proteasome-mediated activity of the immune response for virus-mediated inflammatory heart disease.

{"title": "Energy-Reduced Arrhythmia Termination Using Global Photostimulation in Optogenetic Murine Hearts.", "abstract": "Complex spatiotemporal non-linearity as observed during cardiac arrhythmia strongly correlates with vortex-like excitation wavelengths and tissue characteristics. Therefore, the control of arrhythmic patterns requires fundamental understanding of dependencies between onset and perpetuation of arrhythmia and substrate instabilities. Available treatments, such as drug application or high-energy electrical shocks, are discussed for potential side effects resulting in prognosis worsening due to the lack of specificity and spatiotemporal precision. In contrast, cardiac optogenetics relies on light sensitive ion channels stimulated to trigger excitation of cardiomyocytes solely making use of the inner cell mechanisms. This enables low-energy, non-damaging optical control of cardiac excitation with high resolution. Recently, the capability of optogenetic cardioversion was shown in Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) transgenic mice. But these studies used mainly structured and local illumination for cardiac stimulation. In addition, since optogenetic and electrical stimulus work on different principles to control the electrical activity of cardiac tissue, a better understanding of the phenomena behind optogenetic cardioversion is still needed. The present study aims to investigate global illumination with regard to parameter characterization and its potential for cardioversion. Our results show that by tuning the light intensity without exceeding 1.10 mW mm-2, a single pulse in the range of 10-1,000 ms is sufficient to reliably reset the heart into sinus rhythm. The combination of our panoramic low-intensity photostimulation with optical mapping techniques visualized wave collision resulting in annihilation as well as propagation perturbations as mechanisms leading to optogenetic cardioversion, which seem to base on other processes than electrical defibrillation. This study contributes to the understanding of the roles played by epicardial illumination, pulse duration and light intensity in optogenetic cardioversion, which are the main variables influencing cardiac optogenetic control, highlighting the advantages and insights of global stimulation. Therefore, the presented results can be modules in the design of novel illumination technologies with specific energy requirements on the way toward tissue-protective defibrillation techniques.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2018-12-14", "authors": ["Ra\u00fal AQui\u00f1onez Uribe", "StefanLuther", "LauraDiaz-Maue", "ClaudiaRichter"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01651\n10.2217/fca.13.89\n10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1055/s-0030-1269109\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.09.015\n10.1038/srep35628\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1038/nmeth.f.324\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H1055\n10.1038/ncpcardio0116\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.12.047\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.825091\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.026\n10.1063/1.166289\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.08.1001\n10.1113/JP271739\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2006.01643.x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.054101\n10.1089/pho.2006.24.179\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.1073/pnas.1936192100\n10.1038/nbt.3268\n10.1093/cvr/cvu037\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw574\n10.1016/0375-9601(90)90840-K\n10.1006/jtbi.1999.0957\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.208101\n10.1146/annurev-biophys-060414-034014\n10.1007/s00424-012-1147-2\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.058101\n10.1093/cvr/cvx003\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000145610.64014.E4\n10.1073/pnas.1509380112\n10.1016/0002-9149(75)90865-6"}
{"title": "Profile of pterostilbene-induced redox homeostasis modulation in cardiac myoblasts and heart tissue.", "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of pterostilbene (PTS) on cardiac oxidative stress in vitro, as this is a simple and promising methodology to study cardiac disease. Cardiac myoblasts (H9c2 cells) and homogenised cardiac tissue were incubated with the PTS and cyclodextrin (PTS + HP\u03b2CD) complex for 1 and 24 h, respectively, at concentrations of 50\u03bcM for the cells and 25 and 50\u03bcM for cardiac tissue. The PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex was used to increase the solubility of PTS in water. After the pretreatment period, cardiomyoblasts were challenged with hydrogen peroxide (6.67\u03bcM) for 10 min, while cardiac tissue was submitted to a hydroxyl radical generator system (30 min). Cellular viability, oxidative stress biomarkers (e.g. total reactive oxygen species (ROS), carbonyl assay and lipoperoxidation) and the antioxidant response (e.g. sulfhydryl and the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) were evaluated. In cardiomyoblasts, the PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex (50\u03bcM) increased cellular viability. Moreover, the PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex also significantly increased sulfhydryl levels in the cells submitted to an oxidative challenge. In cardiac tissue, lipid peroxidation, carbonyls and ROS levels were significantly increased in the groups submitted to oxidative damage, while the PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex significantly reduced ROS levels in these groups. In addition, the PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex also provoked increased catalase activity in both experimental protocols. These data suggest that the PTS + HP\u03b2CD complex may play a cardioprotective role through a reduction of ROS levels associated with an improved antioxidant response.", "journal": "Journal of biosciences", "date": "2018-12-14", "authors": ["G KCouto", "R OFernandes", "DLacerda", "CCampos-Carraro", "PTurck", "S EBianchi", "G DFerreira", "I SBrum", "V LBassani", "ABello-Klein", "A S RAraujo"], "doi": null}

This process has been shown also in the heart, where cardiac fibroblasts (CF) differentiate into \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts (MyoFB). Here, we studied the effects on CF, isolated by spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 inhibition in MyoFB differentiation.\nStaining and immunohistochemistry were performed on rat cardiac tissue. CF were isolated by enzymatic digestion from SHR (SHR-CF) and normotensive WKY (WKY-CF) rat hearts and then treated for in vitro evaluation.\nSHR heart tissues revealed a higher TGF-\u03b21 expression vs. WKY samples. SHR-CF showed an enhanced SMAD2/3 activation and an up-regulated expression of \u03b1-SMA, a typical MyoFB marker, especially after TGF-\u03b21 treatment. Immunostaining on cardiac tissues revealed a higher expression of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 in SHR vs. WKY rat hearts. In vitro results confirmed the up-regulation of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 expression in SHR-CF at basal condition and after TGF-\u03b21 treatment, in comparison with WKY-CF. Inhibition of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 by cilengitide treatment led a decreased expression of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25, collagen I, and \u03b1-SMA in SHR-CF vs. WKY-CF, resulting in a diminished differentiation of CF into MyoFB. Taking together, results suggested that SHR-CF are more susceptible to TGF-\u03b21, showing an up-regulated activation of SMAD2/3 signaling, and an increased \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25, \u03b1-SMA, and collagen I expression. Hypertension stimulus promoted an up-regulation of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 on SHR cardiac tissue and its in vitro inhibition reverted pro-fibrotic events of SHR-CF.\nInhibition of integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b25 exerted by cilengitide strongly diminished SHR-CF differentiation into detrimental MyoFB.

Blood routine and blood biochemistry examinations were used to show the changes of blood components. The fibrinolytic and plasmin factors, inflammation-related factors and myocardial-related enzyme in serum were analysised by ELISA and Western blot assay.\nHistopathological and ultrastructural examination of heart, aortic arch, and abdominal aorta showed that serious damage occurred in co-exposure group (n=6/group). Blood routine examination showed that leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia increased markedly, while changes in the erythrocyte count were not obvious in the co-exposure group. The expression of alanine transaminase (ALT) decreased obviously in co-exposure group, while no significant changes were noted in the expression of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol (CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in the co-exposure group on blood biochemistry analysis. In addition, data from ELISA analysis showed that the levels of fibrinolytic and plasmin factors, including thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and antithrombin III (AT III), were decreased, while those of human fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer (D2D) increased significantly in the co-exposure group. Moreover, the myocardial-related enzyme in serum, tested by ELISA, and cardiovascular-related protein expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, tested by Western blot assay, was increased in the heart. Furthermore, the expression of inflammation factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was increased in heart tissue subjected to combined exposure, which was manifested by Western blot assay, while the protein levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) and endothelin 1 were (ET-1) elevated in blood vessels in the co-exposure group.\nIn conclusion, the major interactions involved in subacute toxicity due to co-exposure to low doses of SiNPs and Pb on cardiovascular system were expected to be additive and synergistic in nature.

{"title": "Fundamental Characterization of Conductive Intracardiac Communication for Leadless Multisite Pacemaker Systems.", "abstract": "A new generation of leadless cardiac pacemakers effectively overcomes the main limitations of conventional devices, but only offer single-chamber pacing, although dual-chamber or multisite pacing is highly desirable for most patients. The combination of several leadless pacemakers could facilitate a leadless multisite pacemaker but requires an energy-efficient wireless communication for device synchronization. This study investigates the characteristics of conductive intracardiac communication between leadless pacemakers to provide a basis for future designs of leadless multisite pacemaker systems.\nSignal propagation and impedance behavior of blood and heart tissue were examined by in vitro and in vivo measurements on domestic pig hearts and by finite-element simulations in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz.\nA better signal transmission was obtained for frequencies higher than 10 kHz. The influence of a variety of practical parameters on signal transmission could be identified. A larger distance between pacemakers increases signal attenuation. A better signal transmission is obtained through larger inter-electrode distances and a larger electrode surface area. Furthermore, the influence of pacemaker encapsulation and relative device orientation was assessed.\nThis study suggests that conductive intracardiac communication is well suited to be incorporated in leadless pacemakers. It potentially offers very low power consumption using low communication frequencies.\nThe presented technique enables highly desired leadless multisite pacing in near future.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2018-12-12", "authors": ["LukasBereuter", "TimonKuenzle", "ThomasNiederhauser", "MartinKucera", "DominikObrist", "TobiasReichlin", "HildegardTanner", "AndreasHaeberlin"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2886042"}
{"title": "A review of cardiac glycosides: Structure, toxicokinetics, clinical signs, diagnosis and antineoplastic potential.", "abstract": "Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are secondary compounds found in plants and amphibians and are widely distributed in nature with potential cardiovascular action. Their mechanism is based on the blockage of the heart's sodium potassium ATPase, with a positive inotropic effect. Some of the most well-known CGs are digoxin, ouabain, oleandrin, and bufalin. They have similar chemical structures: a lactone ring, steroid ring, and sugar moiety. Digoxin, ouabain, and oleandrin are classified as cardenolides, consisting of a lactone ring with five carbons, while bufalin is classified as bufodienolides, with a six-carbon ring. Small structural differences determine variations in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of such substances. Most case reports of poisoning caused by CGs are associated with cardiovascular toxicity, causing a variety of arrhythmias and lesions in the heart tissue.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective role of aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against Cd induced oxidative damage in hepatic and cardiac tissues as the TA bark extract has folkloric medicinal use in the treatment of various hepatic and cardiac disorders. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. The control group was treated with normal saline as the vehicle; the second group orally administered with TA (20\u202fmg/kg bw) daily for 15 days; the third group injected with Cd-acetate (0.44\u202fmg/kg bw, s.c.) every alternate day for a period of 15 days; and the fourth group was administered with TA, 60\u202fmin prior to Cd treatment. The biomarkers of organ damage were significantly increased in the Cd treated groups. Besides, a significant alteration in the tissue levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes was observed following treatment with Cd. Additionally, some of the enzymes were found to be inhibited uncompetitively by Cd when tested in an in vitro system. Furthermore, evidence gathered from studies on the histological parameters and mitochondrial membrane potential in both the tissues argue in favour of the possible protective role of TA against Cd induced damage. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of eight major bioactive phytochemicals in aqueous bark extract of TA having potent free radical scavenging property. The results indicate that the extract could protect hepatic and cardiac tissues against Cd-induced oxidative stress mediated damages through antioxidant mechanism(s).", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2018-12-12", "authors": ["BharatiBhattacharjee", "Palash KumarPal", "Arnab KumarGhosh", "SanatanMishra", "AindrilaChattopadhyay", "DebasishBandyopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2018.12.008"}

{"title": "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-mediated signaling re-activates proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of second heart field (SHF Isl1+) that gives rise to the anterior heart field (AHF) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) for the formation of the right ventricle, outflow tract (OFT), and a portion of the inflow tract (IFT). During early cardiogenesis, these AHF CPCs reside within the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) that provides a microenvironment for them to receive signals that direct their cell fates. Here, N-cadherin, which is weakly expressed by CPCs, plays a significant role by promoting the adhesion of CPCs within the AHF, regulating \u03b2-catenin levels in the cytoplasm to maintain high Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation while also preventing the premature differentiation of CPCs. On the contrary, strong expression of N-cadherin observed throughout matured myocardium is associated with downregulation of Wnt signaling due to \u03b2-catenin sequestration at the cell membrane, inhibiting cardioproliferation. As such, upregulation of Wnt signaling pathway to enhance cardiac tissue proliferation in mature cardiomyocytes can be explored as an interesting avenue for regenerative treatment to patients who have suffered from myocardial infarction.\nTo investigate if Wnt signaling is able to enhance cellular proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes, we treated cardiomyocytes isolated from adult mouse heart and both murine and human ES cell-derived matured cardiomyocytes with N-cadherin antibody or CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor in an attempt to increase levels of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin. Immunostaining, western blot, and quantitative PCR for cell proliferation markers, cell cycling markers, and Wnt signaling pathway markers were used to quantitate re-activation of cardioproliferation and Wnt signaling.\nN-cadherin antibody treatment releases sequestered \u03b2-catenin at N-cadherin-based adherens junction, resulting in an increased pool of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin, similar in effect to CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor treatment. Both treatments therefore upregulate Wnt signaling successfully and result in significant increases in matured cardiomyocyte proliferation.\nAlthough both N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 treatment resulted in increased Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation, CHIR99021 was found to be the more effective treatment method for human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we propose that CHIR99021 could be a potential therapeutic option for myocardial infarction patients in need of regeneration of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2018-12-12", "authors": ["YongFan", "Beatrice XuanHo", "Jeremy Kah ShengPang", "Nicole Min QianPek", "Jin HuiHor", "Shi-YanNg", "Boon-SengSoh"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-018-1086-8\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.26\n10.1586/14779072.2014.972941\n10.1038/cr.2014.142\n10.1038/nrg1710\n10.1242/dev.001883\n10.1038/nature08191\n10.1242/dev.099325\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259598\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.06.016\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.219840\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004580\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nmeth.3448\n10.1038/onc.2009.302\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082403\n10.1074/jbc.M110.106575\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024312\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1242/dmm.006510\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000093186.22847.4C\n10.1038/emboj.2011.418\n10.1093/cvr/27.10.1873\n10.1093/hmg/10.19.2061\n10.1038/nrneph.2013.110\n10.1093/cvr/27.12.2130\n10.1038/nature08899\n10.1038/ncb3149\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012559\n10.1111/jnc.13382\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.019\n10.1242/dev.102988\n10.1126/science.1121449\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.031\n10.1016/S0014-5793(02)02370-0\n10.1161/01.RES.0000181132.11393.18\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000429\n10.1186/1756-0500-7-273\n10.1074/jbc.M114.616714\n10.1128/MCB.00930-12\n10.1038/srep13249\n10.1038/onc.2014.416\n10.1083/jcb.141.3.765\n10.1101/gad.287404\n10.1074/jbc.M200184200\n10.1038/ng1045\n10.1387/ijdb.041807cg\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.10.018\n10.1002/ar.a.10085\n10.1083/jcb.136.5.1123"}

{"title": "Polyurethane-Polycaprolactone Blend Patches: Scaffold Characterization and Cardiomyoblast Adhesion, Proliferation, and Function.", "abstract": "A remarkable challenge in myocardial tissue engineering is the development of biomimetic constructs that can potentially improve myocardial repair and regeneration. Polyurethane (PU) scaffolds are extensively utilized in the cardiovascular system. We have synthesized a new biodegradable poly(ester-ether urethane urea) (PEEUU) using a new and simple method. To enhance mechanical and physicochemical properties, the PEEUU was blended with polycaprolactone (PCL). We then fabricated a series of new PU-PCL scaffolds. The scaffolds were then characterized using SEM, porosity measurement, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), DSC, water contact angle measurement, swelling measurement, in vitro degradation rate, and mechanical tests. Expression of the cardiac-specific proteins on the scaffolds was investigated using immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR. The elasticity of blends increased with an increase of PEEUU. In the blend scaffolds, the size and interconnectivity of pores were in an appropriate range (142-170 \u03bcm) as reported in the literature. These blend scaffolds revealed high cell metabolic activity for cardiomyoblasts and also enabled cells to proliferate and express cardiac marker proteins at higher rates. Histological examination of subcutaneously transplanted scaffolds after two months revealed degradation in the blend scaffolds. It is demonstrated that functionality of cells is sensitive to the composition of biomaterials used, and the effective cell-biomaterial interactions are critical in order to create a functional tissue engineered product that allows seeded cells to develop their normal activity.

It exhibits anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Recent studies have revealed that GA has beneficial effects against several cardiovascular diseases; however, whether GA attenuates pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and the underlying mechanism remains unclear.\nPrimary cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II). Cardiac hypertrophic remodeling is induced in mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Myocardial function is evaluated by echocardiographic and hemodynamic analyses, while cardiac tissues are analyzed by histological staining.

Administration of GA in mice markedly improves TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction and attenuates pathological changes, including cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the staining status of different tissues taken from rats with pomegranate flower extract. For this reason, 2 Wistar albino rats, one male and one female, were used as stain biomaterial. A histological follow up procedure was applied to the lung, kidney, liver, and heart tissue samples taken from the rats and the unstained preparates of these tissues were prepared. As the source of the dye, the dry flowers of Punica granatum (PG) obtained from local markets of Kayseri were used. Each tissue sample underwent the same staining procedure with the same temperature, duration, and dye solution. Before and after the staining procedure, \u00d7\u200940 images of the tissue preparates were taken using a light microscope. Generally, different tones of staining were observed in the nuclei and cytoplasms of all cells and epithelium cells. Staining in parts specific to each tissue occurred. For example, there were light stains on the glomerular cells and the Bowman capsule in the kidney tissue Differences in staining can only be explained by molecular diversity differences in tissue.

To battle this limitation, the combination of using stem cells embedded in a bioactive scaffold that promotes cell retention is growing in interest. Yet, a systematic review of the literature on the use of stem cells embedded in bioactive scaffolds for cardiac repair has not yet been performed. In this protocol, we outline a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical trials in animal MI models that utilize stem cell-embedded scaffolds for cardiac repair and compare their effects to stem cell-treated animals without the use of a scaffold.\nWe will search the following electronic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, and gray literature: Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health and Google Scholar. We will only include randomly controlled preclinical trials that have directly investigated the effects of stem cells embedded in a scaffold for cardiac repair in an animal MI model. Two investigators will independently review each article included in the final analysis. The primary endpoint that will be investigated is left ventricular ejection fraction. Secondary endpoints will include infarct size, end systolic volume, end diastolic volume, fractional shortening and left ventricular wall thickness.

Estimation of myocardial properties from regional strain patterns when multiple pathologies are present is therefore a promising application of computer modelling. However, if different tissue properties lead to indistinguishable strain patterns ('degeneracy'), the applicability of any such method will be limited. We investigated whether estimation of local activation time (AT) and contractility from myocardial strain patterns is theoretically possible.\nFor four different global cardiac pathologies local myocardial strain patterns for 1025 combinations of AT and contractility were simulated with a computational model (CircAdapt). For each strain pattern, a cohort of similar patterns was found within estimated measurement error using the sum of least-squared differences. Cohort members came from (1) the same pathology only, and (2) all four pathologies. Uncertainty was calculated as accuracy and precision of cohort members in parameter space. Connectedness within the cohorts was also studied.\nWe found that cohorts drawn from one pathology had parameters with adjacent values although their distribution was neither constant nor symmetrical. In comparison cohorts drawn from four pathologies had disconnected components with drastically different parameter values and accuracy and precision values up to three times higher.\nGlobal pathology must be known when extracting AT and contractility from strain patterns, otherwise degeneracy occurs causing unacceptable uncertainty in derived parameters.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2018-12-07", "authors": ["BorutKirn", "JohnWalmsley", "JoostLumens"], "doi": "10.1186/s12938-018-0614-1"}

Approximately 30% of the cases evolve to the chronic symptomatic stage due to cardiac and/or digestive damage, generally accompanied by nervous system impairment. Given the higher frequency and severity of clinical manifestations related to cardiac tissue lesion, the goal of this study was the identification of proteins associated with the disease progression towards its cardiac form. Thus, T. cruzi bloodstream trypomastigotes proteins were submitted to immunoprecipitation using antibodies from patients with the asymptomatic or cardiac (stages B1 and C) forms of the disease and from healthy donors as control. Immunoreactive proteins were identified and quantified based on mass spectrometry analysis and shifts in the recognition profile were further evaluated. Compared to asymptomatic samples, IgG from stage C patients predominantly detected the I/6 autoantigen, whereas IgG from B1 patients resulted in higher yield of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase precursor, calpain cysteine peptidase, and two variants of CAP5.5. In this work, CAP5.5 recognition by serum immunoglobulin from patients with early cardiomyopathy generated a 23-fold abundance variation when compared to samples from asymptomatic patients, highlighting the participation of this protein in cardiac form progression of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE: While T. cruzi has become the major cause of infectious cardiomyopathy in Latin America, research groups have been struggling to find alternative treatment, vaccine candidates, and improved diagnostic tests. In addition, the absence of adequate biomarkers to assess cure and progression of disease is a major setback for clinical trials and patients monitoring. Therefore, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of T. cruzi pathogenesis and evaluation of suitable candidates for vaccine and diagnostic tests, besides the clinical applicability of the potential biomarkers for patient follow-up and prognosis.

{"title": "Ventricular Endocardial Tissue Geometry Affects Stimulus Threshold and Effective Refractory Period.", "abstract": "Understanding the biophysical processes by which electrical stimuli applied to cardiac tissue may result in local activation is important in both the experimental and clinical electrophysiology laboratory environments, as well as for gaining a more in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms of focal-trigger-induced arrhythmias. Previous computational models have predicted that local myocardial tissue architecture alone may significantly modulate tissue excitability, affecting both the local stimulus current required to excite the tissue and the local effective refractory period (ERP). In this work, we present experimental validation of this structural modulation of local tissue excitability on the endocardial tissue surface, use computational models to provide mechanistic understanding of this phenomena in relation to localized changes in electrotonic loading, and demonstrate its implications for the capture of afterdepolarizations.\nExperiments on rabbit ventricular wedge preparations showed that endocardial ridges (surfaces of negative mean curvature) had a stimulus capture threshold that was 0.21 \u00b1 0.03\u00a0V less than endocardial grooves (surfaces of positive mean curvature) for pairwise comparison (24% reduction, corresponding to 56.2 \u00b1 6.4% of the energy). When stimulated at the minimal stimulus strength for capture, ridge locations showed a shorter ERP than grooves (n\u00a0= 6, mean pairwise difference 7.4 \u00b1 4.2\u00a0ms). When each site was stimulated with identical-strength stimuli, the difference in ERP was further increased (mean pairwise difference 15.8 \u00b1 5.3\u00a0ms). Computational bidomain models of highly idealized cylindrical endocardial structures qualitatively agreed with these findings, showing that such changes in excitability are driven by structural modulation in electrotonic loading, quantifying this relationship as a function of surface curvature. Simulations further showed that capture of delayed afterdepolarizations was more likely in trabecular ridges than grooves, driven by this difference in loading.\nWe have demonstrated experimentally and explained mechanistically in computer simulations that the ability to capture tissue on the endocardial surface depends upon the local tissue architecture. These findings have important implications for deepening our understanding of excitability differences related to anatomical structure during stimulus application that may have important applications in the translation of novel experimental optogenetics pacing strategies.

At the forefront is stem cell-centered therapy, with adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), an adult stem population, providing significant clinical promise. When introduced into damaged heart tissue, ADSCs promote cardiac regeneration by a variety of mechanisms including differentiation into new cardiomyocytes and secretion of paracrine factors acting on endogenous cardiac cells. We discuss the application of ADSCs, their biochemical capabilities, availability, ease of extraction, clinical trial results, and areas of concern. The multipotent capacity of ADSCs along with their ability to secrete factors promoting cell survival and regeneration, along with their immunosuppressive capacity, make them an extremely promising approach in the field of CVD therapy.", "journal": "American journal of stem cells", "date": "2018-12-05", "authors": ["KyleBruun", "ErikaSchermer", "AnjaliSivendra", "EmilyValaik", "Reed BWise", "RanaSaid", "John RBracht"], "doi": null}

{"title": "A novel model of reno-cardiac syndrome in the C57BL/ 6 mouse strain.", "abstract": "The end stage renal disease population has a 20 fold higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality compared to the overall population. The development of reno-cardiac syndrome in these patients will result in cardiovascular events to be the cause of 50% of fatalities. There is therefore a need to research improved therapeutic strategies to combat renal cardiac pathologies. Murine in vivo models contribute greatly to such research allowing for specific genetic modification and reduced miscellany, however there is currently no reliable model of reno-cardiac syndrome in the most common genetically modified mouse strain, the C57BL/6. In this study we have manipulated an established model of chronic renal disease using adenine infused diet and prolonged the course of its pathology achieving chronic renal failure and subsequent reno-cardiac syndrome in the C57BL/6 mouse.\nEight\u2009week-old male C57BL/ 6 mice were acclimatised for 7\u2009days before administration of a 0.15% adenine diet or control diet for 20\u2009weeks. Cardiac function was assessed in mice at week 20 by echocardiography. At experiment termination blood and urine samples were analysed biochemically and organ dysfunction/injury was determined using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.\nAdministration of 0.15% adenine diet caused progressive renal failure resulting in reno-cardiac syndrome. At endpoint uraemia was confirmed by blood biochemistry which in the adenine fed mice showed significant increases in serum creatinine, urea, calcium (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) potassium (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Reno-cardiac syndrome was confirmed by a significantly increased heart to body weight ratio (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and echocardiography which showed significant reductions in percentage of ejection fraction, fractional shortening, fractional area change, (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and an increase in left ventricular end diastolic volume (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Immunoblotting of kidney and heart tissue showed increased apoptosis (caspase 3) and fibrosis (fibronectin) and increases in the cardiac levels of phosphorylated Akt, and renal total Akt. Immunohistochemistry for \u03b1-SMA, collagen 1 and collagen 3 further confirmed fibrosis.\nWe present a novel regimen of adenine diet which induces both chronic kidney disease and reno-cardiac syndrome in the C57/BL6 mouse strain.

Cardiac tissues were collected from the pre-ACS and ACS time points to analyze the histopathological changes, antioxidant status and the expression of heat shock proteins, inflammatory factors and immune-related cytokines. The CS II heart tissues showed shrunken cell membranes and nuclei, disordered or ruptured myocardial fibers, higher MDA content and upregulation in HSP27, HSP40, HSP70, NF-\u03baB, COX-2, PTGEs, iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-4 mRNAs, and in protein levels of HSP40, NF-\u03baB and iNOS and reduction in CAT, GSH-px and SOD activity, as well as HSP90 and IFN-\u03b3 levels compared to the control tissues before ACS. In contrast, the HSPs were significantly increased, and the inflammatory and immune related factors were unaltered prior to the ACS in the CS I compared to the C group. Following ACS, MDA content was significantly increased and antioxidant activity was significantly decreased in the CS I and CS II groups compared to the C group. The levels of HSP27, HSP70, HSP90, inflammatory factors and IL-4 were significantly reduced and that of IFN-\u03b3 was significantly increased in CS I broiler hearts; the reverse trends were seen in CS II relative to CS I. Compared to the pre-ACS levels, that of HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, inflammatory factors and IL-4 were increased and IFN-\u03b3 was decreased in the C and CS II groups after ACS.

Here, we explore the mechanism of microRNA-592 (miR-592) in heart development and CHD with the involvement of KCTD10 and Notch signaling pathway in a CHD mouse model. Cardiac tissues were extracted from CHD and normal mice. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect positive expression rate of KCTD10. A series of inhibitor, activators, and siRNAs was introduced to verified regulatory functions for miR-592 governing KCTD10 in CHD. Furthermore, the effect of miR-592 on cell proliferation and apoptosis was also investigated. Downregulated positive rate of KCTD10 was observed in CHD mice. Downregulation of miR-592 would upregulate expression of KCTD10 and inhibit the activation of Notch signaling pathway, thus promote cell proliferation.

The levels of fortilin and S100A1 in serum were measured antemortem (to establish the basal levels in serum) and postmortem (to evaluate changes after methomyl exposure) using enzyme-linked immunoassay. S100A1 was immunostained in sections from cardiac tissues. Both proteins in the control were not significantly different (", "journal": "Human & experimental toxicology", "date": "2018-11-27", "authors": ["S DNusair", "A NJoukhan", "Ah BaniRashaid", "A MRababa'h"], "doi": "10.1177/0960327118814153"}

Cardiac muscle failure is a crucial condition that provokes life-threatening outcomes. Heretofore, regeneration therapies in MI have used stem-cell-based therapy instantly after a myocardial injury to prevent the disease process and tissue malfunction. Despite the therapeutic utility of stem-cell-based regenerative therapy, barriers to successful treatment have been addressed. In this chapter, we illustrate a variety of emerging biomaterial strategies for enhancing the function of therapeutic stem cells, such as cell surface modification to synthetically endowing stem cells with new characteristics and hydrogels with its biological and mechanical properties. These investments offer a potential accompaniment to traditional stem-cell-based therapies for enhancing the efficacy of stem cell therapy to design properly activating cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2018-11-25", "authors": ["HyunbumKim", "Seung-Hyun LKim", "Young-HwanChoi", "Young-HyunAhn", "Nathaniel SHwang"], "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-0445-3_11"}
{"title": "RNA-binding proteins RBM20 and PTBP1 regulate the alternative splicing of FHOD3.", "abstract": "Regulation of alternative splicing events is an essential step required for the expression of functional cytoskeleton and sarcomere proteins in cardiomyocytes. About 3% of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy cases present mutations in the RNA binding protein RBM20, a tissue specific regulator of alternative splicing. Transcripts expressed preferentially in skeletal and cardiac muscle, including TTN, CAMK2D, LDB3, LMO7, PDLIM3, RTN4, and RYR2, are RBM20-dependent splice variants. In the present study, we investigated the RBM20 involvement in post-transcriptional regulation of splicing variants expressed by Formin homology 2 domain containing 3 (FHOD3) gene. FHOD3 is a sarcomeric protein highly expressed in the cardiac tissue and required for the assembly of the contractile apparatus. Recently, FHOD3 mutations have been found associated with heart diseases. We identified novel FHOD3 splicing variants differentially expressed in human tissues and provided evidences that FHOD3 transcripts are specific RBM20 and PTBP1 targets. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of RBM20 and PTBP1 promoted the alternative shift, from inclusion to exclusion, of selected FHOD3 exons. These results indicate that RBM20 and PTBP1 play a role in the actin filament functional organization mediated by FHOD3 isoforms and suggest their possible involvement in heart diseases.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2018-11-24", "authors": ["PLorenzi", "ASangalli", "SFochi", "ADal Molin", "GMalerba", "DZipeto", "M GRomanelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2018.11.009"}

Expression levels of HOTAIR and receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in rat heart were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression level of pEKR in rat heart was detected by Western blot. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rats were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The hypoxia-induced H9C2 cells were used to construct the MI model in vitro. Meanwhile, the expression levels of HOTAIR and RAGE in H9C2 cells were detected. The levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the culture medium were determined by ELISA. Rescue experiments were conducted by co-transfecting pcDNA-HOTAIR and si-RAGE in H9C2 cells. Subsequently, the levels of pERK, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 were detected.\nThe mRNA expression levels of HOTAIR and RAGE in the AMI group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Western blot showed remarkably higher protein levels of RAGE and pERK in AMI rats when compared with those of controls. Similarly, results of ELISA indicated that the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in AMI rats were significantly higher than those of controls. Meanwhile, overexpression of HOTAIR in H9C2 cells remarkably elevated the expression levels of HOTAIR and RAGE.

{"title": "Utility of Glycosylated TIMP3 molecules: Inhibition of MMPs and TACE to improve cardiac function in rat myocardial infarct model.", "abstract": "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) is a secreted protein that has a great utility to inhibit elevated metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in injured tissues including infarcted cardiac tissue, inflamed vessels, and joint cartilages. An imbalance between TIMP3 and active MMP levels in the local tissue area may cause worsening of disease progression. To counter balance elevated MMP levels, exogenous administration of TIMP3 appeared to be beneficial in preclinical studies. However, the current form of WT-TIMP3 molecule has a limitation to be a therapeutic candidate due to low production yield, short plasma half-life, injection site retention, and difficulty in delivery, etc. We have engineered TIMP3 molecules by adding extra glycosylation sites or fusing with albumin, Fc, and antibody to improve pharmacokinetic properties. In general, the C-terminal fusion of TIMP3 improved expression and production in mammalian cells and extended half-lives dramatically 5-20 folds. Of note, a site-specific glycosylation at K22S/F34N resulted in a higher level of expression and better cardiac function compared to other fusion proteins in the context of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) changes in a rat myocardial infarction model. It appeared that cardiac efficacy depends on a high ECM binding affinity, in which K22S/F34N and N-TIMP3 showed a higher binding to the ECM compared to other engineered molecules.

Early detection of cellular changes induced by such events is vital to identify appropriate countermeasures to prevent organ damage. We hypothesize that chemically induced organ injuries are uniquely associated with a set (module) of genes exhibiting significant changes in expression. We have previously identified gene modules specifically associated with organ injuries by analyzing gene expression levels in liver and kidney tissue from rats exposed to diverse chemical insults. Here, we assess and validate our injury-associated gene modules by analyzing gene expression data in liver, kidney, and heart tissues obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to thioacetamide, a known liver toxicant that promotes fibrosis. The rats were injected intraperitoneally with a low (25 mg/kg) or high (100 mg/kg) dose of thioacetamide for 8 or 24 h, and definite organ injury was diagnosed by histopathology. Injury-associated gene modules indicated organ injury specificity, with the liver being most affected by thioacetamide.

The mechanisms leading to this detrimental occurrence are not completely clear, and lately many authors focused their attention on the possible role of microRNAs (miRNAs), small regulators of cardiovascular functions, in this phenomenon. Notably, these molecules recently emerged also as potential circulating biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was the simultaneous investigation of circulating and cardiac tissue miRNAs expression upon DOX treatment in vivo.\nTwenty C57BL/6 female mice were administered with 24\u2009mg/Kg cumulative dose of DOX or saline (CTRL) for 2 weeks. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and at the end of treatment (T1). Plasma and heart samples were collected at T1, separating atria from left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles, and miRNAs expression was tested by RT-qPCR-based arrays. All putatively DOX-regulated candidates were then validated by single assays in vivo and then evaluated also in murine immortalized cardiomyocytes (HL-1) treated with 1 \u03bcM DOX for 24\u2009h. In the end, bioinformatics target prediction was performed for all DOX-miRNAs.\nCardiotoxicity onset was diagnosed upon impairment of six cardiac functional parameters in DOX-treated mice at T1. Samples collection, followed by screening and validation steps, identified eleven miRNAs dysregulated by the drug in plasma, while seven resulted as altered in separate heart chambers. Interestingly, miR-34a-5p and miR-451a showed a dysregulation in both plasma and tissue samples of DOX-administered animals, whereas five additional miRNAs presented chamber specific modulation. Of note, in vitro experiments showed a very modest overlap with in vivo results. Bioinformatics prediction analysis performed on miR-34a-5p and miR-451a identified several putative targets presenting no significant association with cardiotoxicity. Anyhow, the same analyses, conducted by combining all miRNAs regulated by DOX in each heart chamber, evidenced a possible dysregulation of the adherens junctions gene network, known to be involved in the onset and progression of dilated cardiomyopathy, an established detrimental side effect of the drug.\nThis is the first work investigating miRNAs regulation by DOX both in plasma and heart districts of treated animals.

{"title": "Marker-Free Tracking for Motion Artifact Compensation and Deformation Measurements in Optical Mapping Videos of Contracting Hearts.", "abstract": "Optical mapping is a high-resolution fluorescence imaging technique, which provides highly detailed visualizations of the electrophysiological wave phenomena, which trigger the beating of the heart. Recent advancements in optical mapping have demonstrated that the technique can now be performed with moving and contracting hearts and that motion and motion artifacts, once a major limitation, can now be overcome by numerically tracking and stabilizing the heart's motion. As a result, the optical measurement of electrical activity can be obtained from the moving heart surface in a co-moving frame of reference and motion artifacts can be reduced substantially. The aim of this study is to assess and validate the performance of a 2D marker-free motion tracking algorithm, which tracks motion and non-rigid deformations in video images. Because the tracking algorithm does not require markers to be attached to the tissue, it is necessary to verify that it accurately tracks the displacements of the cardiac tissue surface, which not only contracts and deforms, but also fluoresces and exhibits spatio-temporal physiology-related intensity changes. We used computer simulations to generate synthetic optical mapping videos, which show the contracting and fluorescing ventricular heart surface. The synthetic data reproduces experimental data as closely as possible and shows electrical waves propagating across the deforming tissue surface, as seen during voltage-sensitive imaging. We then tested the motion tracking and motion-stabilization algorithm on the synthetic as well as on experimental data. The motion tracking and motion-stabilization algorithm decreases motion artifacts approximately by 80% and achieves sub-pixel precision when tracking motion of 1-10 pixels (in a video image with 100 by 100 pixels), effectively inhibiting motion such that little residual motion remains after tracking and motion-stabilization. To demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, we present optical maps with a substantial reduction in motion artifacts showing action potential waves propagating across the moving and strongly deforming ventricular heart surface. The tracking algorithm reliably tracks motion if the tissue surface is illuminated homogeneously and shows sufficient contrast or texture which can be tracked or if the contrast is artificially or numerically enhanced. In this study, we also show how a reduction in dissociation-related motion artifacts can be quantified and linked to tracking precision. Our results can be used to advance optical mapping techniques, enabling them to image contracting hearts, with the ultimate goal of studying the mutual coupling of electrical and mechanical phenomena in healthy and diseased hearts.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2018-11-20", "authors": ["JanChristoph", "StefanLuther"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01483\n10.1016/0960-0779(95)00089-5\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2148719\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1117/1.3630115\n10.1152/ajpheart.1992.263.3.H972\n10.1038/nature26001\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.09.015\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.12.047\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.247494\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75910-3\n10.1007/s10439-014-1172-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.3.H1421\n10.1152/ajpheart.00404.2012\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.01.016\n10.1117/12.408594\n10.1109/TBME.2004.840464\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203828\n10.1152/ajpheart.00574.2003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021934\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.03.043"}
{"title": "3D Carbon-Nanotube-Based Composites for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a disease of epidemic proportion and a leading cause of mortality in the world. Because cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells with minimal intrinsic ability to self-regenerate, cardiac tissue engineering has emerged as one of the most realistic therapeutic strategies for cardiac repair. We have previously proven the ability of carbon nanotube scaffolds to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation, maturation, and long-term survival. Here, we tested if three-dimensional scaffolds of carbon nanotube-based composites can also promote cardiomyocyte growth, electrophysiological maturation, and formation of functional syncytia. To this purpose, we developed an elastomeric scaffold that consists of a microporous and self-standing material made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) containing micrometric cavities, and integrated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the scaffold. We combined microscopy, cell biology, and calcium imaging to investigate whether neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) cultured on the 3D-PDMS+MWCNT acquire a more viable and mature phenotype compared to control. We found that when cultured in the 3D-PDMS+MWCNTs, NRVMs showed improved viability (", "journal": "ACS applied bio materials", "date": "2018-11-19", "authors": ["ValentinaMartinelli", "SusannaBosi", "BrisaPe\u00f1a", "GabrieleBaj", "Carlin SLong", "OrfeoSbaizero", "MauroGiacca", "MaurizioPrato", "LuisaMestroni"], "doi": "10.1021/acsabm.8b00440"}
{"title": "Phosphorylation of Cx43 residue Y313 by Src contributes to blocking the interaction with Drebrin and disassembling gap junctions.", "abstract": "Phosphorylation regulates connexin43 (Cx43) function from assembly/disassembly to coupling at the plaque. Src is a tyrosine kinase known to both phosphorylate Cx43 (residues Y247 and Y265) and affect gap junction intercellular communication. However, the Cx43 carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain contains additional tyrosine residues and proteomic discovery mass spectrometry data identified Y313 as a potential phosphorylation target. Based upon the study of Lin et al. (2001) J. Cell Biol., which still observed tyrosine phosphorylation by Src when using a Cx43 Y247/Y265F mutant, we addressed the possibility of Y313 phosphorylation (pY313) by Src. In vitro Src phosphorylation of purified Cx43CT followed by mass spectroscopy revealed that Src also phosphorylates Y313. This observation was confirmed by repeating the in vitro phosphorylation using different combinations of Cx43CT Y\u202f\u2192\u202fF mutants and a general anti-pTyr antibody. Next, a phospho-specific antibody was generated to help characterize the importance of pY313. We established an in cyto experimental system by stably expressing Cx43 WT and mutants (Y247F, Y265F, Y313F, Y247/265F, Y247/313F, Y265/313F, or Y247/265/313F) in Cx43-deficient HeLa cells. Cx43 WT and mutants, in the absence of v-Src, localized to the plasma membrane and formed gap junctions. When v-Src was over-expressed, Cx43 WT localized intracellularly, while all of the single and double mutants remained able to form plaques and transfer dye, albeit variable in number and amount, respectively. Complete Src-resistance was only achieved with the Cx43 Y247/265/313F mutant. Furthermore, Cx43 Y265F inhibited the ability of v-Src to phosphorylate Y247 and Y313 as well as phosphorylation at both Y265 and Y313 was necessary to inhibit the Cx43 interaction with Drebrin. Finally, we observed in diseased cardiac tissue, in which Src is active, an increase in intercalated disc and intracellular localized Cx43 pY313.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-11-19", "authors": ["LiZheng", "HanjunLi", "AndrewCannon", "Andrew JTrease", "GaelleSpagnol", "HongZheng", "StanleyRadio", "KaushikPatel", "SurinderBatra", "Paul LSorgen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.11.008"}
{"title": "Enhancing all-in-one bioreactors by combining interstitial perfusion, electrical stimulation, on-line monitoring and testing within a single chamber for cardiac constructs.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering strategies have been extensively exploited to generate functional cardiac patches. To maintain cardiac functionality in vitro, bioreactors have been designed to provide perfusion and electrical stimulation, alone or combined. However, due to several design limitations the integration of optical systems to assess cardiac maturation level is still missing within these platforms. Here we present a bioreactor culture chamber that provides 3D cardiac constructs with a bidirectional interstitial perfusion and biomimetic electrical stimulation, allowing direct cellular optical monitoring and contractility test. The chamber design was optimized through finite element models to house an innovative scaffold anchoring system to hold and to release it for the evaluation of tissue maturation and functionality by contractility tests. Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts subjected to a combined perfusion and electrical stimulation showed positive cell viability over time.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice could alter serum and cardiac activities of these enzymes and their association to disease pathophysiology. For that, we measured total leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils (just 48\u202fh of infection) that were lower in infected animals after 48 and 72\u202fh in infected mice compared with negative control, while total protein and globulin plasma levels were higher after 72\u202fh of infection. The serum CK activity was higher in infected animals 48 and 72\u202fh post-infection compared to the control group, as well as observed for mitochondrial cardiac CK activity. The serum PK activity was higher in infected animals after 72\u202fh of infection compared to the control group, and lower in the cardiac tissue. The cardiac AK activity was lower in infected animals 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh post-infection compared to the control group, while serum and cardiac LDH activities were higher. Based on these evidences, it is possible to conclude that the stimulation of CK activity exerts a key role as an attempt to maintain the bioenergetic homeostasis by the production of phosphocreatine to avoid a rapid fall on the concentrations of total adenosine triphosphate.

And exhibits multiple biological activities, including an antioxidant activity. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of its antioxidant activity remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidant activity of QI and the underlying molecular mechanism in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). An oxidative stress model was established in HUVECs using H2O2, and cells were then treated with different concentrations of QI. The results revealed that the exposure of HUVECs to QI protected these cells from H2O2\u2011induced damage. QI treatment also increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the cell culture medium. In addition, QI inhibited H2O2\u2011induced apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of cleaved Caspase\u20119 and poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase. QI also inhibited the production of DNA fragments and reactive oxygen species induced by H2O2. Furthermore, QI decreased the oxidative stress by promoting the nuclear transfer of nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2011related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase\u20111 by activating autophagy, and inhibited the competition of Bach1 from Nrf2. Finally, QI significantly improved the activities of T\u2011SOD and GSH, and decreased the content of malondialdehyde in the serum and heart tissue of aging rats.

Recently, the relationship between dyslipidemia and pro-inflammatory insults has led to further understanding on the CVD-predisposing effects of dyslipidemia. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced hyperlipidemia would cause heart damage and to study the potential role of local cardiac lipid dysregulation in the occurrence of cellular injury.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal chow or HFHC diet groups, and sacrificed after 2 or 4\u00a0weeks, respectively. Lipid peroxidation marker level was measured. Lipid parameters in the rat hearts were detected. Cardiac damage was evaluated.\nHFHC diet increased serum levels of cholesterol and free fatty acids (FFAs) and led to systemic oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status. Cardiac lipid dysregulation, which was characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and adipocyte (A)- and heart (H)-fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), occurred after HFHC diet for 4\u00a0weeks. Cardiac damage was further evident with elevated circulating H-FABP levels, increased cardiac interstitial fibrosis and the loss of troponin I.\nOur data demonstrated that HFHC diet led to systemic and cardiac lipid dysregulation, accompanied by systemic oxidative and pro-inflammatory stresses, and these may finally cooperate to cause a series of pathological changes of the heart tissue.

The present study explored the relationship between enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling and lowered production of miR-199a-5p in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. This study firstly found the correlation between elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, as well as subsequent STAT3 signaling activation and the downregulation of miR-199a-5p in hypoxic myocardial samples from children with congenital heart disease. Then, using model of hypoxic mice and the intervention of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), it was observed that pSTAT3 affected the expression of miR-199a-5p and modulated the expression of its target genes, including endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and 78\u00a0kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Further observation revealed that the pSTAT3 signal in cardiac tissue could affect the expression of pri-miR-199a-2, a precursor of miR-199a-5p. And the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay also confirmed that pSTAT3 could bind to the promoter region of miR-199a-2 gene, which is more significant under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, the activation of STAT3 signaling in cardiomyocytes during chronic hypoxia leads to downregulation of miR-199a-5p, which promotes the expression of many downstream target genes.

In response, animals invoke a heat stress response by inducing heat shock proteins (HSPs). Scientists are actively seeking natural products that can enhance the heat shock response. The present study aimed at assessing the effects of a purified rosemary extract comprising antioxidant compounds on the heat shock response and HSP expression profile in broiler chickens. The response of broilers to HS in the presence of purified rosemary extract was assessed using an in vivo myocardial cell model. Pathological lesions of heart tissue were examined microscopically. The levels and activities of enzymes associated with heart damage and oxidative damage were detected. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for HSPs in myocardial cells. The results showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and myocardial CK (CKMB) levels were reduced by the purified rosemary extract before and during heat stress. Heat stress alone increased CK and CKMB levels. The levels of oxidative damage-associated enzymes were compared between the rosemary\u2009+\u2009heat stress and heat stress-alone groups. The results indicated that in terms of these enzymes, the purified rosemary extract induced a more antioxidative state. Pathological examinations showed that heat stress caused myocardial fiber fracture, karyopyknosis, and degeneration. The addition of purified rosemary extract ameliorated these lesions to some degree, preserving more of the basic structure.

This common strategy may belie an incomplete understanding of heterogeneous underlying mechanisms and could be a barrier to more precise treatments.

Using a multi-analytic approach including covariate adjustment for age and sex, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified characterizing HF and disease-specific expression. Pathway analysis investigated enrichment for biologically relevant pathways and functions. DCM vs NF and ICM vs NF had shared HF-DEGs that were enriched for the fetal gene program and mitochondrial dysfunction. DCM-specific DEGs were enriched for cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion pathways. ICM-specific DEGs were enriched for cytoskeletal and immune pathway activation. Using the ICM and DCM DEG signatures from our data we were able to correctly classify the phenotypes of 24/31 ICM and 32/36 DCM samples from publicly available replication datasets.\nOur results demonstrate the commonality of mitochondrial dysfunction in end-stage HF but more importantly reveal key etiology-specific signatures.

This study was designed to investigate the role of calpain-2 and its downstream signal pathway in heat stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart dysfunction. In cultured primary mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes (MNCs), heat stress (43\u00b0C for 2\u2009hr) induced a heat-shock response, as indicated by upregulated heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) expression and cellular apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and decreased cell viability. Meanwhile, heat stress decreased calpain activity, which was accompanied by downregulated calpain-2 expression and increased phosphorylation of p38, extraceIIuIar signaI-reguIated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminaI kinase (JNK). Calpain-2 overexpression abrogated heat stress-induced apoptosis and phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, but not of ERK1/2. Blocking only p38 prevented heat stress-induced apoptosis in MNCs.

M-mode echocardiography also demonstrated that calpain-2 overexpression significantly improved heatstroke-induced decreases in ventricular end-diastolic volume and cardiac output.

Antiarrhythmic drug development focuses on atrial biology for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Here we used recent retinoic acid-based protocols to generate atrial CMs from hiPSCs and establish right atrial engineered heart tissue (RA-EHT) as a 3D model of human atrium. EHT from standard protocol-derived hiPSC-CMs (Ctrl-EHT) and intact human muscle strips served as comparators. RA-EHT exhibited higher mRNA and protein concentrations of atrial-selective markers, faster contraction kinetics, lower force generation, shorter action potential duration, and higher repolarization fraction than Ctrl-EHTs. In addition, RA-EHTs but not Ctrl-EHTs responded to pharmacological manipulation of atrial-selective potassium currents. RA- and Ctrl-EHTs' behavior reflected differences between human atrial and ventricular muscle preparations. Taken together, RA-EHT is a model of human atrium that may be useful in preclinical drug screening.", "journal": "Stem cell reports", "date": "2018-11-13", "authors": ["MartaLemme", "B\u00e4rbel MUlmer", "Marc DLemoine", "Antonia T LZech", "FrederikFlenner", "UrsulaRavens", "HermannReichenspurner", "MiriamRol-Garcia", "GodfreySmith", "ArneHansen", "TorstenChrist", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.10.008"}
{"title": "(Pro)renin/renin receptor expression during normal and preeclamptic pregnancy in rats.", "abstract": "Pregnancy is a physiological stage with profound cardiovascular changes leading to hypotension. Preeclampsia (PE) reverts these normal changes inducing hypertension. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been related in PE genesis. It has been reported a novel receptor in the system, the Prorenin/Renin receptor (PRR), with several roles in renal and cardiovascular illnesses. It is not known, however, if PRR changes its expression or is activated during normal or PE-complicated pregnancy on tissues intimately related to hypertension. So, the aim of this work was to describe PRR expression during normal and hypertensive pregnancy in rats.\nWe used a subrenal aortic coarctation (SRAC) model in rats. Atria, septum and ventricular heart tissue, aorta and renal tissue samples were homogenized and immunoblotted using anti-PRR and anti-PLZF antibodies. We also measured gene expression by RT-PCR.\nHypertension and proteinuria were observed in SRAC-pregnant rats. In pregnant, non-SRAC rats, PRR showed a higher expression of both, gene and protein compared to non-pregnant rats in heart, aorta and kidney tissues. PE induces a very high expression of PRR in cardiac tissues and, on the contrary, decreases PRR expression in both, aorta and kidney. PLZF, a marker of PRR function, was augmented only in aorta and kidney in non-SRAC pregnant rats. In SRAC-pregnant rats, PLZF increment disappeared.\nThese findings indicate that PRR expression changes differently during pregnancy and PE in tissues related to cardiovascular functions and suggest a probable participation of the receptor during normal and preeclamptic pregnancy in the rat.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2018-11-12", "authors": ["M AAvila-Ram\u00edrez", "R LEsteban-Mart\u00ednez", "EL\u00f3pez-Moctezuma", "LAnguiano-Robledo", "M EHern\u00e1ndez-Campos", "PL\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.017"}

Resistin, a type of adipokine, has been found to bind to adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). However, the effects of resistin on cardiac homing by ADSCs and on ADSC-mediated cardioprotective effects have not been investigated. ADSCs were obtained from enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic mice. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) or sham operations. Six hours after the I/R operation, mice were intravenously injected with resistin-treated ADSCs (ADSC-resistin) or vehicle-treated ADSCs (ADSC-vehicle). Cardiac homing by ADSCs and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were investigated 3 days after I/R. Cardiac function, fibrosis, and angiogenesis were evaluated 4 wk after I/R. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were investigated in vitro using cultured ADSCs. Both immunostaining and flow cytometric experiments showed that resistin treatment promoted ADSC myocardial homing 3 days after intravenous injection. Echocardiographic experiments showed that ADSC-resistin, but not ADSC-vehicle, significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction. ADSC-resistin transplantation significantly mitigated I/R-induced fibrosis and reduced atrial natriuretic peptide/brain natriuretic peptide mRNA expression. In addition, cardiomyocyte apoptosis was reduced, whereas angiogenesis was increased by ADSC-resistin treatment.

However, using full thickness decellularized myocardium as cardiac patch may lead to poor viability and inhomogeneous distribution of delivered cells, due to perfusion limitations. In this study, we explored the feasibility of decellularized porcine myocardial slice (dPMS) to construct a vascularized cardiac patch for cell delivery. Decellularized porcine myocardium was sliced into thin layers (thickness~300\u2009\u00b5m). Adipose-derived Stem cells (ASCs) obtained from rat and pig were seeded on dPMS. The viability, infiltration, and differentiation of seeded ASCs were examined. The mechanical properties of dPMSs of various thickness and native myocardium were tested. We noticed dPMS supported attachment and growth of rat and pig ASCs. Both rat and pig ASCs showed high viability, similar patterns of proliferation and infiltration within dPMS. Rat ASCs showed expression of early-endothelial markers followed by mature-endothelial marker without any additional inducers on dPMS. Using rat myocardial infarction model, we delivered ASCs using dPMS patched to the infarcted myocardium. After 1 week, a higher number of transplanted cells were present in the infarcted area when cells were delivered using dPMS versus direct injection.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of 2,3-dehydrosilybin preconditioning in isolated rat heart.", "abstract": "2,3-dehydrosilybin (DHS) is a minor component of silymarin, Silybum marianum seed extract, used in some dietary supplements. One of the most promising activities of this compound is its anticancer and cardioprotective activity that results, at least partially, from its cytoprotective, antioxidant, and chemopreventive properties. The present study investigated the cardioprotective effects of DHS in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats. Isolated hearts were perfused by the Langendorff technique with low dose DHS (100\u202fnM) prior to 30\u202fmin of ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion. After 60\u202fmin of coronary reperfusion infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining, while lactatedehydrogenase activity was evaluated in perfusate samples collected at several timepoints during the entire perfusion procedure. Signalosomes were isolated from a heart tissue after reperfusion and involved signalling proteins were detected. DHS reduced the extent of infarction compared with untreated control hearts at low concentration; infarct size as proportion of ischemic risk zone was 7.47\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.1% for DHS versus 75.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.8% for ischemia. This protective effect was comparable to infarct limitation induced by ischemic preconditioning (22.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5%). Selective inhibition of Src-family kinases with PP2 (4-Amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(t-butyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) abrogated the protection afforded by DHS. This study provides experimental evidence that DHS can mediate Src-kinase-dependent cardioprotection against myocardial damage produced by ischemia/reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Fitoterapia", "date": "2018-11-06", "authors": ["EvaGabrielov\u00e1", "LenkaBarto\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1", "Ji\u0159\u00edNe\u010das", "MartinModriansk\u00fd"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fitote.2018.10.028"}
{"title": "Analyses of changes in myocardial long non-coding RNA and mRNA profiles after severe hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation via RNA sequencing in a rat model.", "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury has been proven to induce organ dysfunction and death, although the mechanism is not fully understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have drawn wide attention with their important roles in the gene expression of some biological processes and diseases, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this paper, a total of 26 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into two groups: sham and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removing 45% of the estimated total blood volume followed by reinfusion of shed blood. High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to analyze differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the heart tissue 4\u00a0h after reperfusion. Myocardial function was also evaluated.\nAfter resuscitation, the decline of myocardial function of shocked animals, expressed by cardiac output, ejection fraction, and myocardial performance index (MPI), was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05). DE lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified by absolute value of fold change\u2009\u2265\u20092 and the false discovery rate \u2264\u20090.001. In rats from the I/R injury group, 851 lncRNAs and 1015 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated while 1533 lncRNAs and 1702\u00a0m RNAs were significantly down-regulated when compared to the sham group. Among the DE lncRNAs, we found 12 location-associated with some known apoptosis-related protein-coding genes which were up-regulated or down-regulated accordingly, including STAT3 and Il1r1. Real time PCR assays confirmed that the expression levels of five location-associated lncRNAs (NONRATT006032.2, NONRATT006033.2, NONRATT006034.2, NONRATT006035.2 and NONRATT029969.2) and their location-associated mRNAs (STAT3 and Il1r1) in the rats from the I/R injury group were all significantly up-regulated versus the sham group.\nThe DE lncRNAs (NONRATT006032.2, NONRATT006033.2, NONRATT006034.2 and NONRATT006035.2) could be compatible with their role in myocardial protection by stimulating their co-located gene (STAT3) after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.

Methods A total of 48 rats were randomly assigned into the sham group, AMI group, low-dose PNS group [100 mg/(kg.d)] and high-dose PNS group [500 mg/(kg.d)]. The rat model of AMI was established by coronary ligation, and 6 rats were sacrificed in each group after 7 and 21 days of treatment with high and low doses of PNS. The heart function of rats was detected by echocardiography before execution, and peripheral blood and heart tissue were collected. Flow cytometry was used to test the proportions of CD90, CD105, CD54 or CD106 positive cells in the peripheral blood. ELISA was performed to measure the levels of stem cell factor (SCF) in the peripheral blood. TTC staining was applied to evaluate the infarct size of myocardial tissues. TUNEL assay was carried out to determine the apoptosis of myocardial tissues and immunohistochemistry to determine the expression levels of CD105 in the infarction area. Results Compared with the sham group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the AMI group significantly increased. Seven days or 21 days after the intervention with PNS, the infarction area and the apoptotic rates in the PNS treated groups were observably alleviated when compared with the AMI group. In addition, at 7 days and 21 days after operation, the LVEF and LVFS decreased, whereas the LVIDs, LVIDd, LVEDV and LVESV significantly decreased in the AMI groups when compared with the sham group. Treatment with PNS could effectively improve the above alterations. When compared with the AMI group, PNS treatment significantly increased the proportions of CD90 or CD105 positive cells and the concentration of SCF, whereas decrease the proportions of CD54 or CD106 positive cells in the peripheral blood in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the level of CD105 in the marginal zone of AMI was significant higher in the PNS treated groups when compared with that in the AMI group.

Cardiac patches are printed with bioinks composed of cECM, hCPCs, and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA). GelMA-cECM bioinks print uniformly with a homogeneous distribution of cECM and hCPCs. hCPCs maintain >75% viability and incorporation of cECM within patches results in a 30-fold increase in cardiogenic gene expression of hCPCs compared to hCPCs grown in pure GelMA patches. Conditioned media from GelMA-cECM patches show increased angiogenic potential (>2-fold) over GelMA alone, as seen by improved endothelial cell tube formation. Finally, patches are retained on rat hearts and show vascularization over 14 d in vivo. This work shows the successful bioprinting and implementation of cECM-hCPC patches for potential use in repairing damaged myocardium.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2018-11-01", "authors": ["DonaldBejleri", "Benjamin WStreeter", "Aline L YNachlas", "Milton EBrown", "RobertoGaetani", "Karen LChristman", "Michael EDavis"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201800672"}

Caloric-restriction (CR) is said to decrease the formation of oxidatively modified cellular macromolecules and improve health. On the other hand, some studies indicate that many CR studies are flawed, because ad libitum fed rats are not well-controlled. Thus, it is claimed that purported beneficial effects of CR could be not due to real CR effect, but due to control animals going obese. Also, it remains to be elucidated whether effects of CR could be observed even when CR is started in mid-adulthood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped as: non-CR 6-month-old rats (n\u2009=\u20097), 24-month-old rats subjected to 40% CR for 6\u00a0months between 18th and 24th\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u20098), and non-CR 24-month-old animals (n\u2009=\u20098). We investigated 16 previously validated biomarkers of macromolecular redox homeostasis, ranging from protein and lipid oxidation to glycation and antioxidative capacity. In the present study, the protein, lipid and antioxidant capacity redox homeostasis biomarkers overwhelmingly indicate that, CR, even though not started very early in adulthood, could still offer potential therapeutic effects and it could significantly improve various redox homeostasis biomarkers associated with disease reliably in the heart tissue of aging male Sprague-Dawley rats.

{"title": "Overexpression of miR-142-3p improves mitochondrial function in cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that Src homology 2 (SH2) B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) plays an important role in cardiac hypertrophy, but the specific mechanism remains to be studied. Through bioinformatics and related research, it is found that miR-14 2-3 p is closely related to SH2B1. Exploring the relationship between miR-14 2-3 p and gene SH2B1 expression is beneficial for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy. SH2B1 is a key factor regulating energy metabolism, mitochondria are the main organelles of energy metabolism and cardiac hypertrophy are closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. So it is particularly important to explore the relationship between miR-14 2-3 p and SH2B1 and myocardial mitochondrial function. In this study, we investigated whether overexpression of miR-14 2-3 p can inhibit the expression of gene SH2B1, ameliorate cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy.\nWe first constructed a pressure overload myocardial hypertrophy model by ligation of the abdominal aorta(AB) of rats. After 4 weeks of modeling, echocardiographic examination showed that the heart volume of the model group became larger, and Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Kit (HE) staining showed that the cross-sectional area of the heart tissue became larger. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), \u03b2-Myosin Heavy Chain (\u03b2-MHC) messenger RNA (mRNA) increased by real\u2011time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which proved that the model of cardiac hypertrophy was successfully constructed. Then, miR-14 2-3 p agomir was injected into the tail vein of rats 2 weeks and 4 weeks respectively. The expression of miR-4 2-3 p mRNA was increased by PCR, suggesting that the miR-14 2-3 p plasmid was successfully transfected. At 4 weeks of pressure overload myocardial hypertrophy model, echocardiography was used to detect cardiac function. HE staining of heart tissue and the expression of ANP, BNP, \u03b2-MHC mRNA were used to detect cardiac hypertrophy. Flow cytometry was used to detect changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Secondly, we observed the effect of miR-14 2-3 p on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial function in vitro by culture neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Afterwards, using angiotensin (Ang)II-, miRNA mimic- and miRNA mimic nc- treated cardiomyocytes for a given time. \u03b1-actin staining found that the myocardial cells became larger, The expression of ANP, BNP, \u03b2-MHC mRNA increased by PCR, which proved that AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy was successfully constructed. Then, the mitochondrial density was measured using mitochondrial Mito-Red staining by Confocal microscope, the mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated using flow cytometry, Mitochondrial respiration oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured by a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer XF96, and the expression levels of miR-14 2-3 p, ANP, BNP, \u03b2-MHC mRNA, SH2B1 in the cardiomyocytes of different groups were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Finally, we used luciferase assay and transfected miR-14 2-3 p agomir in rats, transfected miR-14 2-3 p mimic in Cardiomyocytes, it is found that myocardial SH2B1 mRNA and protein expression both were reduced.\nWhen the pressure overload myocardial hypertrophy model was constructed for four weeks, echocardiography revealed that the heart volume, Left ventricular end diastolic diameter(LVIDd), Left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVIDs), Left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWd), Systolic left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWs), Left ventricle (LV) Mass increased, Ejection fraction (EF) % decreased of AB group increased, but transfected with miR-14 2-3 p agomir of AB, these increase was not significant, EF% reduction was not obvious. HE staining showed that the myocardial cross-sectional area of AB group increased significantly, but the miR-14 2-3 p agomir treatment of AB group did not increase significantly. PCR analysis showed that the expression of ANP, BNP,\u03b2-MHC mRNA was significantly increased in AB group, but the miR-14 2-3 p agomir treatment of AB group was not significantly increased. Flow cytometry showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential of AB group was significantly reduced, and the miR-14 2-3 p agomir treatment of AB group was not significantly decreased. During AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, ANP, BNP,\u03b2-MHC mRNA expression was increased, while these factors was not significantly increased in miR-14 2-3 p mimic treatment group; mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial density and OCR was significantly decreased in AngII treated group, and these were not significantly reduced in miR-14 2-3 p mimic treatment group; CONCLUSIONS: miR-14 2-3 p not only mitigate cardiac hypertrophy by directly inhibit the expression of gene SH2B1, but also can protect mitochondrial function in cardiac hypertrophy of vitro and vivo.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-10-31", "authors": ["Bei-LeiLiu", "MianCheng", "ShanHu", "ShunWang", "LeWang", "XinTu", "Cong-XinHuang", "HongJiang", "GangWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.146"}

{"title": "Areas of Cartilaginous and Osseous Metaplasia After Experimental Myocardial Infarction in Rats.", "abstract": "The presence of hyaline cartilage has been previously documented in heart tissue of different vertebrates, ranging from birds to superior mammals. However, there is scarce published data regarding the appearance of focal deposits of hyaline-like cartilage within the hearts of laboratory rats. Few mechanisms that could trigger the appearance of this type of cartilage in heart were hypothesized (e.g., mechanical stress, ageing). Using different microscopy techniques this report confirms the presence of hyaline cartilage and bone in Wistar rats, which underwent left anterior coronary artery ligation for experimental myocardial infarction. The presented (ultra)structural evidence of focal chondroid metaplasia in the papillary muscles and close to the insertion point in the ventricular mass of the infarcted heart suggests a structural adaptation of cardiac myocardium to the newly acquired kinetics of left ventricular wall, after experimental myocardial infarction. Specific cartilaginous matrix proteins are known to mediate cardiac extracellular matrix remodeling, and this study provides evidence of a complete transition to a cartilaginous pattern in postinfarcted heart, which may nonetheless constitute a supplemental risk factor of a further heart failure condition. Moreover, for heart focal chondrogenesis, we also presume the involvement of the cellular and molecular inflammatory milieu that dominates the first 24 hr border zone landscape of the experimental myocardial infarction lesion.

We aimed to delineate the mechanisms underlying the potential ameliorative effects of hesperidin against chronically ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity. Sixty male albino rats were divided into normal control group, hesperidin-treated control group, untreated alcoholic group, and hesperidin-treated alcoholic group. Transcription factor-EB (TFEB) expression levels were estimated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PGC1-\u03b1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 \u03b1, poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity, and tenascin C levels in cardiac tissues were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; while tissue malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated spectrophotometrically. Our data portrayed promoting lysosomal biogenesis, as judged by upregulation of TFEB expression and its target PGC1-\u03b1, as well as decreased PARP-1 activity and offsetting inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue injury as the principal culprits mediating the cardioprotective effect of hesperidin in alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "Effect of equiaxial cyclic strain on cardiomyogenic induction in mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Differentiation of stem cells and functionality of target cells are regulated by microenvironmental stimuli to which the cells are exposed. Chemical agents such as growth factors and physical parameters including mechanical loadings are among major stimuli. In this study, equiaxial cyclic strain with two amplitudes was applied on rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rAMSCs) with or without 5-azacytidine. The mRNA expression of cardiac-related genes was investigated through RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method. Moreover, morphological features and the actin structure of the cells were studied. Results were indications of significant increase in mRNA expression among four target genes, which marked the increase in two principal cardiac markers of GATA4 and \u03b1-cardiac actin, and lesser increase in two other genes (NKX2-5, \u03b2MHC) in all experimental groups treated chemically and/or mechanically. Such effect was maximal when both treatments were applied describing the synergistic effect of combined stimuli. All treatments caused significant increase in cell area and cell shape index. The well spreading of cells was accompanied by enhanced actin structure, especially among samples subjected to mechanical stimulus. Both effects were among required features for functional muscle cells such as cardiac cells. It was concluded that the cyclic equiaxial strain enhanced cardiomyogenic induction among rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and such effect was strengthened when it was accompanied by application of chemical factor.

Carvedilol (Cv), a non-selective beta blocker drug indicated to treat heart failure and antihypertensive has shown to promote antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties which might improve the inflammation induced by T. cruzi. OBJECTIVES Evaluate the role of Cv on the inflammatory response of C57BL/6 mice acutely infected with the Colombian strain of T. cruzi. METHODS Animals were infected with the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and treated with Cv (25 mg/kg/day), benznidazole (Bz) (100 mg/kg/day) or their combination. On the 28th day of infection and 23 days of treatment, the euthanasia occurred, and the heart preserved for histopathological, oxidative stress (SOD, catalase, TBARs, carbonylated proteins) and plasma (CCL2, CCL5, TNF, IL-10) analyses. Parasitaemia and survival were assessed along the infection. FINDINGS Cv decreased TBARs, but increased the mortality rate, the parasitaemia and the levels of CCL2, CCL5, catalase and the inflammatory infiltrate in the cardiac tissue. Bz led the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate and circulating levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators in the infected mice.

However, it is associated with cardiotoxicity. Fisetin is a plant flavonoid reported to have anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic potential. To evaluate the cardioprotective potential of fisetin in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in experimental rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were pre-treated with either fisetin (10, 20 and 40\u00a0mg/kg) or sitagliptin (10\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) for 7\u00a0days. Cardiac toxicity was induced in rats (except the normal group) by doxorubicin (15\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) on 8th day. Various behavioral, biochemical, molecular and histological parameters were assessed in cardiac tissue. DOX-induced alterations in electrocardiographic, hemodynamic and left ventricular function were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) inhibited by fisetin (20 and 40\u00a0mg/kg) treatment. Fisetin significantly decrease (p\u2009<\u20090.05) DOX-induced elevated serum CK-MB, LDH, AST, ALT and ALP levels. DOX-induced elevated cardiac oxido-nitrosative (SOD, GSH, MDA and NO) was significantly inhibited (p\u2009<\u20090.05) by fisetin.

Despite the apparent health benefits that these diets may provide for insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, their implications on cardiomyocyte oxidative capacity have yet to be investigated. To evaluate the adaptations induced by a 6-week low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet on mitochondrial respiration, two groups of male mice were investigated: Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on a LCHF diet (L-DIET) and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on a regular rodent diet (CON). Heart tissue was extracted and used for high-resolution respirometry (HRR), while immunoblotting was performed to quantify mitochondrial density and complexes. The results demonstrate increased expression of all five mitochondrial subunits in the L-DIET group compared to control condition. Furthermore, HRR revealed increased efficiency of substrate consumption, implying augmented oxidative capacity in the L-DIET group.

Human heart tissue for isolating cardiac cells is generally hard to obtain, particularly from all four chambers of the same heart. Since different parts of the heart have different functions and therefore may have different immunoregulatory properties, ability to analyse cells from all chambers allows for a unique and comprehensive investigation. Cells were isolated from all four chambers of the heart from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation surgery due to severe chronic heart failure (CHF) (n\u202f=\u202f6). Cells isolated from one donor heart, were used for comparison with the experimental group. Primary cultured human cardiac fibroblasts were treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response. Cells were also subjected to hypoxia. To determine immunoregulatory properties of the cells, cytokine and chemokine profiles were determined using multiplex ELISA. RESULTS: On average, the fibroblasts population constituted approximately 90% of the expanded non-myocytes. Levels of cytokines and chemokines were markedly increased in human cardiac fibroblasts cultured under inflammatory conditions, with a similar response in fibroblasts from all compartments of the heart. Unexpectedly, hypoxia did not further augment cytokine and chemokine secretion.

Their transduction across scale lengths is an inherently symbiotic phenomenon that while influencing ECM fate is also mediated by the ECM structure itself. This study investigates the possibility of enhancing ECM elaboration by topological cues that, while not modifying the substrate macro scale mechanics, can affect the meso-scale strain range acting on cells incorporated within the scaffold. Vascular smooth muscle cell micro-integrated, electrospun scaffolds were fabricated with comparable macroscopic biaxial mechanical response, but different meso-scale topology. Seeded scaffolds were conditioned on a stretch bioreactor and exposed to large strain deformations. Samples were processed to evaluate ECM quantity and quality via: biochemical assay, qualitative and quantitative histological assessment and multi-photon analysis. Experimental evaluation was coupled to a numerical model that elucidated the relationship between the scaffold micro-architecture and the strain acting on the cells. Results showed an higher amount of ECM formation for the scaffold type characterized by lowest fiber intersection density. The numerical model simulations associated this result with the differences found for the change in cell nuclear aspect ratio and showed that given comparable macro scale mechanics, a difference in material topology created significant differences in cell-scaffold meso-scale deformations.

{"title": "LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 Mediates Pyroptosis in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common complication of diabetes and can cause heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden death. The pathogenesis of DCM includes altered metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death and extracellular matrix remodeling. Recently, pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death related to inflammation, was proven to be activated in DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in DCM remain elusive. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Kcnq1ot1 participates in many cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to clarify whether Kcnq1ot1 affects cardiac pyroptosis in DCM.\nAC16 cells and primary cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5.5 and 50 mmol/L glucose. Diabetic mice were induced with streptozotocin (STZ). Kcnq1ot1 was silenced both in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of Kcnq1ot1. Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses were used to detect the degree of pyroptosis. Echocardiography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson's trichrome staining were used to detect the cardiac function and morphology in mice. Cell death and function were detected using TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence staining and Ca2+ measurements.\nThe expression of Kcnq1ot1 was increased in patients with diabetes, high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes and diabetic mouse cardiac tissue. Silencing Kcnq1ot1 alleviated pyroptosis by targeting miR-214-3p and caspase-1. Furthermore, silencing Kcnq1ot1 reduced cell death, cytoskeletal structure abnormalities and calcium overload in vitro and improved cardiac function and morphology in vivo.\nKcnq1ot1 is overexpressed in DCM, and silencing Kcnq1ot1 inhibits pyroptosis by influencing miR-214-3p and caspase-1 expression.

{"title": "TFAM overexpression reduces pathological cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a functional lack of myocardial performance due to a loss of molecular control over increases in calcium and ROS, resulting in proteolytic degradative advances and cardiac remodeling. Mitochondria are the molecular powerhouse of cells, shifting the sphere of cardiomyocyte stability and performance. Functional mitochondria rely on the molecular abilities of safety factors such as TFAM to maintain physiological parameters. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) creates a mitochondrial nucleoid structure around mtDNA, protecting it from mutation, inhibiting NFAT (ROS activator/hypertrophic stimulator), and transcriptionally activates Serca2a to decrease calcium mishandling. Calpain1 and MMP9 are proteolytic degratory factors that play a major role in cardiomyocyte decline in HF. Current literature depicts major decreases in TFAM as HF progresses. We aim to assess TFAM function against Calpain1 and MMP9 proteolytic activity and its role in cardiac remodeling. To this date, no publication has surfaced describing the effects of aortic banding (AB) as a surgical HF model in TFAM-TG mice. HF models were created via AB in TFAM transgenic (TFAM-TG) and C57BLJ-6 (WT) mice. Eight weeks post AB, functional analysis revealed a successful banding procedure, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy as observed via echocardiography. Pulse wave and color doppler show increased aortic flow rates as well as turbulent flow at the banding site. Preliminary results of cardiac tissue immuno-histochemistry of HF-control mice show decreased TFAM and compensatory increases in Serca2a fluorescent expression, along with increased Calpain1 and MMP9 expression. Protein, RNA, and IHC analysis will further assess TFAM-TG results post-banding. Echocardiography shows more cardiac stability and functionality in HF-induced TFAM-TG mice than the control counterpart. These findings complement our published in vitro results.

{"title": "Electrophysiological Stimulation of Whole Heart Constructs in an 8-Pole Electrical Field.", "abstract": "Today 2D and 3D electrophysiological stimulation represents a well established concept to enhance myocardial development and maturation in tissue-engineered constructs. However, electrical field stimulation has never been adapted to complex whole heart constructs (WHC). This study demonstrates the impact of three-dimensional electrophysiological stimulation of tissue-engineered WHC in a custom made eight-pole electrical field stimulation system by short model cultivations with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CM). Therefore, WHC were generated by repopulation of decellularized rat hearts with neonatal CM and subjected to perfusion based cultivation with or without additional biophysicalstimulation for 96 h. Spontaneous electrophysiological (EP) activity of the processed WHC was analyzed by qualitative evaluation of multielectrode assay (MEA) signal sequences, descriptive comparative spike sorting, and direct contrasting assessment in simple numerical quantities complemented by impulse response tests after phasing out spontaneous EP activity. As strong reduction of voltage signals by the decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) component of WHC was observed, the active principle was determined and used to estimate the spectrum of source signals to recorded values by calculative elimination. Western blotting of key myocardial markers was employed to substantiate the functional EP evaluation by classical biochemical analysis. We observed stable spontaneous EP activity showing clear R and S, but predominantly rS patterns, for both stimulated WHC and non-stimulated controls. By the impact of stimulation, mean voltage amplitudes and beating frequencies could be significantly increased. The active principle of signal reduction in decellularized ECM could be shown to follow a nonlinear damping function with remarkable accuracy, illustrating that recorded signals of moderate voltage amplitudes can also represent far-field measurements of strong signals that are emitted in distant depths of the ECM while small amplitudes are limited to actually represent also rather weak source-signals. After phasing out spontaneous activity, both stimulated WHC and non-stimulated controls could be excited again to emit immediate impulse responses. The observed beneficial impact of 8-pole field stimulation on functional EP activity could finally be validated on the biochemical level by showing increased ratios for myosin heavy chain, cardiac tropnin T, desmin, and connexin 43 for stimulated WHC by Western blot analysis. In conclusion, we found that although electrophysiological stimulation has been incorporated into the whole heart tissue-engineered concept from the very beginning, this study presents for the first time a concept for the transfer of electrical field stimulation to the whole heart tissue-engineered approach.

{"title": "Silencing the CSF-1 Axis Using Nanoparticle Encapsulated siRNA Mitigates Viral and Autoimmune Myocarditis.", "abstract": "Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle most commonly caused by viral infection and often maintained by autoimmunity. Virus-induced tissue damage triggers chemokine production and, subsequently, immune cell infiltration with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine production follows. In patients, the overall inflammatory burden determines the disease outcome. Following the aim to define specific molecules that drive both immunopathology and/or autoimmunity in inflammatory heart disease, here we report on increased expression of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) in patients with myocarditis. CSF-1 controls monocytes originating from hematopoietic stem cells and subsequent progenitor stages. Both, monocytes and macrophages are centrally involved in mediating tissue damage and fibrotic scarring in the heart. CSF-1 influences monocytes via engagement of CSF-1 receptor, and it is also produced by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system themselves. Based on this, we sought to modulate the virus-triggered inflammatory response in an experimental model of Coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis by silencing the CSF-1 axis in myeloid cells using nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA. siCSF-1 inverted virus-mediated immunopathology as reflected by lower troponin T levels, a reduction of accumulating myeloid cells in heart tissue and improved cardiac function. Importantly, pathogen control was maintained and the virus was efficiently cleared from heart tissue. Since viral heart disease triggers heart-directed autoimmunity, in a second approach we investigated the influence of CSF-1 upon manifestation of heart tissue inflammation during experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). EAM was induced in Balb/c mice by immunization with a myocarditogenic myosin-heavy chain-derived peptide dissolved in complete Freund's adjuvant. siCSF-1 treatment initiated upon established disease inhibited monocyte infiltration into heart tissue and this suppressed cardiac injury as reflected by diminished cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function at later states. Mechanistically, we found that suppression of CSF-1 production arrested both differentiation and maturation of monocytes and their precursors in the bone marrow.

Although investment in drug discovery and development has been sky-rocketing, the number of approved drugs has been declining. Cardiovascular toxicity due to therapeutic drug use claims the highest incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions in late-stage clinical development. Therefore, to address this issue, new, additional, replacement and combinatorial approaches are needed to fill the gap in effective drug discovery and screening. The motivation for developing accurate, predictive models is twofold: first, to study and discover new treatments for cardiac pathologies which are leading in worldwide morbidity and mortality rates; and second, to screen for adverse drug reactions on the heart, a primary risk in drug development. In addition to in vivo animal models, in vitro and in silico models have been recently proposed to mimic the physiological conditions of heart and vasculature. Here, we describe current in vitro, in vivo, and in silico platforms for modelling healthy and pathological cardiac tissues and their advantages and disadvantages for drug screening and discovery applications.

In BAT, Resveratrol significantly reduced the plin5 protein level and gene expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In heart tissue, Resveratrol and strength training, decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) the plin5 expression, but Metformin increased the gene expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In skeletal muscle, resveratrol, strength training, cold and Metformin significantly increased the plin5 expression at the gene and protein level (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Yet, we aimed to explore the effect and possible mechanism of RD on blood-pressure response to hemorrhagic shock in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\nA total of 48 male spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomized to three groups: study group, sham-operation group and control group. RD was achieved by cutting off renal nerves and swabbing phenol on it. Ten weeks after RD, 8 rats in each group were sacrificed to collect the kidney and heart tissues. The remaining rats were subjected to an operation to induce hemorrhagic shock which would lead to 40% loss of total blood volume, and observed for 120\u00a0min. The serum concentration of norepinephrine was measured before and three weeks after RD.\nThe blood-pressure and norepinephrine levels were reduced significantly after RD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"title": "Proteasome biology and therapeutics in cardiac diseases.", "abstract": "The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major pathway for intracellular protein degradation in most organs, including the heart. UPS controls many fundamental biological processes such as cell cycle, cell division, immune responses, antigen presentation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. The UPS not only degrades substrates but also regulates activity of gene transcription at the post-transcription level. Emerging evidence suggests that impairment of UPS function is sufficient to cause a number of cardiac diseases, including heart failure, cardiomyopathies, hypertrophy, atrophy, ischemia-reperfusion, and atherosclerosis. Alterations in the expression of UPS components, changes in proteasomal peptidase activities and increased ubiquitinated and oxidized proteins have also been detected in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the pathophysiological role of the UPS in DCM has not been examined. Recently, in vitro and in vivo studies have proven highly valuable in assessing effects of various stressors on the UPS and, in some cases, suggesting a causal link between defective protein clearance and disease phenotypes in different cardiac diseases, including DCM. Translation of these findings to human disease can be greatly strengthened by corroboration of discoveries from experimental model systems using human heart tissue from well-defined patient populations.

Myocardial dysfunction, often termed sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, is a frequent complication and is associated with worse outcomes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and a growing body of evidence suggests that bioenergetic and metabolic derangements play a central role in its development; however, there are significant discrepancies in the literature, perhaps reflecting variability in the experimental models employed or in the host response to sepsis. The condition is characterised by lack of significant cell death, normal tissue oxygen levels and, in survivors, reversibility of organ dysfunction. The functional changes observed in cardiac tissue may represent an adaptive response to prolonged stress that limits cell death, improving the potential for recovery.

Studies demonstrate resveratrol exhibits a set of benefits, including anti-oxidative property, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation. However, the molecular mediators of resveratrol-induced cardiac benefits are still not fully disclosed. Present study aims to investigate whether estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-\u03b1, an orphan nuclear receptor, determines the protective benefits of resveratrol in obesity-related cardiomyopathy. Through high fat diet-fed mouse model, our results show resveratrol increases cardiac ERR-\u03b1 level and attenuates diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial inactivity and inflammatory response. Co-administration of lentivirus encoding Err-\u03b1 siRNA abolishes these benefits, such as enlargement of cardiomyocyte size, induction of left ventricular dysfunction and structural disorders. More importantly, we firstly find resveratrol stimulates the cardiac mitochondrial activities, but silencing Err-\u03b1 decreased mitochondrial function on ATP production, oxygen consumption and complex I activity. Besides, Err-\u03b1 deficiency also reverses resveratrol-mediated suppression of inflammatory response in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Piezo-bending actuators for isometric or auxotonic contraction analysis of engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Engineered heart tissue (EHT) has proven as valuable tool for disease modelling, drug safety screening, and cardiac repair. Especially in combination with the stem cell technology, these in vitro models of the human heart have generated interest not only of basic cardiovascular researchers but also of regulatory authorities responsible for drug safety. A main limitation of 3D-based assays for evaluating cardiotoxicity is their limited throughput. We integrated piezo-bending actuators in a 24-well system for the generation of strip-like rat and human EHT attached to hollow, elastic silicone posts. Muscle contractions of EHTs induced a measurable electrical current in the piezo-bending actuators that could be analysed for contraction amplitude, frequency, and contraction and relaxation kinetics. Compared with the standard video-optical analysis of contractile activity, the new system allows for (a) the analysis of several tissues in parallel, (b) switching between auxotonic and isometric contractions by inserting a stiff metal post in the silicone post opposing the piezo actuator, (c) continuous measurement over days with low data volume (megabyte), (d) automated measurement without the necessity of adjustment of tissue position for video-optical analysis, (e) reduced complexity and costs, (f) high sensitivity of contraction detection, (g) calculation of absolute contraction force, and (h) suitability for variable tissue geometries. The new set-up for contraction analysis based on piezo-bending actuators is a promising new method for the parallel screening of EHT for pharmacological drug effects and other applications of muscle tissue engineering (e.g., skeletal muscle engineering or cardiac repair).", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2018-10-20", "authors": ["IngraMannhardt", "ChristophWarncke", "Hoc KhiemTrieu", "J\u00f6rgM\u00fcller", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1002/term.2755"}
{"title": "Cardiomyocytes and Macrophages Discourse on the Method to Govern Cardiac Repair.", "abstract": "In response to pathophysiological stress, the cardiac tissue undergoes profound remodeling process that incorporates the elimination of dying resident cells, compensatory hypertrophy of functional cardiomyocytes, growth and remodeling of the vascular compartment and formation of a fibrotic scar. Accumulating evidences indicate that cardiac remodeling is, at least in part, controlled by a complex crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and macrophages. The strategic location of abundant macrophages to the proximity of cardiomyocytes suggest that they could regulate the fate of cardiomyocytes in the injured heart. As such, macrophages appear as critical support cells for cardiomyocytes and play central roles in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and remodeling. Notably, the cardiac tissue expands heterogeneous population of cardiac macrophages through local proliferation of resident macrophage as well as recruitment and differentiation of blood-derived monocytes. It has also been suggested that cardiac-resident macrophages display distinct functional properties from that of monocyte-derived macrophages in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, macrophages are an overflowing source of biological entities with non-canonical roles on cardiac conduction or cardiomyocyte proliferation by regulating action potential diffusion or cardiac cell cycle reentry. Alternatively, stressed cardiomyocytes can trigger the release of a broad repertoire of instructive signals that can regulate macrophage number, skew their phenotype and therefore direct their beneficial or deleterious actions. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries describing how the intricate dialogue between cardiomyocytes and macrophages can shape the deleterious or healing signaling mechanisms in the injured cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2018-10-20", "authors": ["IngridGomez", "VincentDuval", "Jean-S\u00e9bastienSilvestre"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2018.00134\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.013\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.11.019\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308270\n10.1084/jem.20140639\n10.1038/ni.2419\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.018\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303567\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.04.008\n10.1084/jem.20170689\n10.1172/JCI29919\n10.1038/nm.3284\n10.1038/ni.2638\n10.1038/ni.2063\n10.1016/j.immuni.2012.12.001\n10.1126/science.1175202\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028833\n10.1084/jem.20160081\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060547\n10.1177/1074248408329860\n10.1172/jci.insight.87315\n10.1073/pnas.1406508111\n10.1038/ncomms12150\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301720\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.001357\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02706.x\n10.1093/cvr/cvq078\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80729-1\n10.1074/jbc.M212321200\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707914\n10.1152/ajpheart.00641.2013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00795.2013\n10.1038/nutd.2017.1\n10.1038/nm.3925\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.950543\n10.1172/JCI0214190\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn456\n10.1093/cvr/cvp040\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147181.65298.4D\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110950\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.131110\n10.1172/JCI41080\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000178\n10.1038/ncomms13344\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.7554/eLife.25605\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304269\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301198\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020857\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.08.009\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.03.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311327\n10.1172/JCI83822\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.01428\n10.1038/nature20141\n10.1038/nm.3816\n10.15252/emmm.201707565\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.06.006\n10.1038/nm.4428\n10.1084/jem.20082596\n10.1172/JCI70577\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311326\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.10.002\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw240\n10.1016/j.healun.2016.01.013\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024590\n10.1172/JCI85782\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308030"}
{"title": "Identification and characterization of two zebrafish Twik related potassium channels, Kcnk2a and Kcnk2b.", "abstract": "KCNK2 is a 2 pore domain potassium channel involved in maintaining cellular membrane resting potentials. Although KCNK2 is regarded as a mechanosensitive ion channel, it can also be gated chemically. Previous research indicates that KCNK2 expression is particularly enriched in neuronal and cardiac tissues. In this respect, KCNK2 plays an important role in neuroprotection and has also been linked to cardiac arrhythmias. KCNK2 has subsequently become an attractive pharmacologic target for developing preventative/curative strategies for neuro/cardio pathophysiological conditions. Zebrafish represent an important in vivo model for rapidly analysing pharmacological compounds. We therefore sought to identify and characterise zebrafish kcnk2 to allow this model system to be incorporated into therapeutic research. Our data indicates that zebrafish possess two kcnk2 orthologs, kcnk2a and kcnk2b. Electrophysiological analysis of both zebrafish Kcnk2 orthologs shows that, like their human counterparts, they are activated by different physiological stimuli such as mechanical stretch, polyunsaturated fatty acids and intracellular acidification. Furthermore, both zebrafish Kcnk2 channels are inhibited by the human KCNK2 inhibitory peptide spadin.

{"title": "A Comparative Assessment of Human and Chimpanzee iPSC-derived Cardiomyocytes with Primary Heart Tissues.", "abstract": "Comparative genomic studies in primates have the potential to reveal the genetic and mechanistic basis for human specific traits. These studies may also help us better understand inter-species phenotypic differences that are clinically relevant. Unfortunately, the obvious limitation on sample collection and experimentation in humans and non-human apes severely restrict our ability to perform dynamic comparative studies in primates. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their corresponding differentiated cells, may provide a suitable alternative system for dynamic comparative studies. Yet, to effectively use iPSCs and differentiated cells for comparative studies, one must characterize the extent to which these systems faithfully represent biological processes in primary tissues. To do so, we compared gene expression data from primary adult heart tissue and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from multiple human and chimpanzee individuals. We determined that gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes from both human and chimpanzee is most similar to that of adult hearts compared to other adult tissues. Using a comparative framework, we found that 50% of gene regulatory differences between human and chimpanzee hearts are also observed between species in cultured cardiomyocytes; conversely, inter-species regulatory differences seen in cardiomyocytes are found significantly more often in hearts than in other primary tissues.

{"title": "Characterization of NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence signatures in a Langendorff isolated-perfused rat heart model.", "abstract": "Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a promising label-free approach to characterize biological samples with demonstrated potential to report structural and biochemical alterations in tissues in a number of clinical applications. We report a characterization of the ex vivo autofluorescence fingerprint of cardiac tissue, exploiting a Langendorff-perfused isolated rat heart model to induce physiological insults to the heart, with a view to understanding how metabolic alterations affect the autofluorescence signals. Changes in the autofluorescence intensity and lifetime signatures associated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) were characterized during oxygen- or glucose-depletion protocols. Results suggest that both NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence intensity and lifetime parameters are sensitive to changes in the metabolic state of the heart owing to oxygen deprivation.

{"title": "Acute alcohol prevents the refeeding-induced decrease in autophagy but does not alter the increased protein synthetic response in heart.", "abstract": "Ethanol produces a state of anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle; however, whether the heart displays a similar defect is unknown. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of acute ethanol administration on the major signal transduction pathways in the heart that are responsible for regulating the protein synthetic and degradative response to refeeding. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were fasted for 12\u00a0h. Mice were then either refed normal rodent chow for 30\u00a0min or a separate group of mice remained food deprived prior to administration of 3-g/kg ethanol. Cardiac tissue and blood were collected 1\u00a0h thereafter and analyzed. Acute ethanol prevented the nutrient-induced stimulation of S6K1 phosphorylation in heart, but did not alter the phosphorylation of S6, eIF4B, and eEF2, known downstream substrates for this kinase. The refeeding-induced redistribution of eIF4E into the active eIF4F complex was also not changed by acute ethanol. Consistent with the above-mentioned changes in signaling proteins, ethanol did not impair the refeeding-induced increase in cardiac protein synthesis. Proteasome activity was not altered by alcohol and/or refeeding. In contrast, ethanol antagonized the refeeding-induced increase in ULK1 phosphorylation and p62 as well as the reduction in LC3B-II and Atg5/12 complex proteins.

The ultimate goal is to prevent the progression of heart failure and apoptotic processes. Cardiac tissue may regenerate itself but to certain extent depending on the number of resident stem cells that is limited. Thus, research had been focused on bone marrow derived stem cells (BM-MSCs) as a promising therapy in different types of tissues, including the heart. This study is designed not only to assess the therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs but also to improve their therapeutic effect in combination with antioxidant \u03b1-lipoic acid (ALA) and antihypertensive therapeutic drug form (AP) against isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury and compared with that of BM-MSCs alone. Cardiac injury was induced in 70 male rats by Isoproterenol (ISO was injected s.c. for four consecutive days). Experimental animals were divided into six ISO-treated groups beside a control non treated one. The six ISO-treated groups were divided into: ISO group, ISO+BM-MSCs group, ISO+ALA group, ISO+AP group, ISO+ALA+AP group and ISO+ALA+AP+BM-MSCs group, the last five groups were treated with the examined materials after one week of ISO injection. Isoproterenol significantly increased serum CK-MB, LDH activities, Troponin1 and TNF-\u03b1. Oxidative stress is evidenced by the increased MDA, NO and Caspase-3 activity associated with significant reduction of GSH content and SOD activity in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, mRNA expression of NF\u03baB and iNOS were significantly up regulated and eNOS mRNA expression was down regulated. Administration of BM-MSCs, ALA and AP alone significantly mitigated the induced cardiac injury. Concomitant administration of ALA and AP after BM-MSCs induced a more pronounced improving effect on cardiac functions. In conclusion, the concomitant administration of ALA and AP after BM-MSCs infusion increases the cellular antioxidant levels of cardiac tissue that improves the repairing function of BM-MSCs.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2018-10-12", "authors": ["Abeer IAbd El-Fattah", "M SZaghloul", "N AEltablawy", "L ARashed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2018.10.002"}

Hearts of different species were collected at various stages of embryonic development and studied to map immunoreactivity in cardiac tissues. We performed detection on alternating serial paraffin sections using immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin or sarcomeric actin as myocardial markers, and HNK-1 to visualize overall staining pattern and then positivity in specific myocyte populations. We observed HNK-1 expression of various intensity distributed in the extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cell surface of cardiac cushions in most of the examined hearts. Strong staining was found in the cardiac nerve fibers and ganglia in all species. The myocardium of the sinus venosus and the atrioventricular canal exhibited transitory patterns of expression. In the Pogona and Crocodylus hearts, as well as in the Gallus and Coturnix ones, additional expression was detected in a subset of myocytes of the (inter)ventricular septum.

According to cardiac morphology and function changes, 4 groups could be distinguished: sham rabbits (n=12), and MI rabbits with no (MI_NO_LVSD; n=10), moderate (MI_M_LVSD; n=9) and severe (MI_S_LVSD; n=15) LVSD. No significant differences in cardiac function or wall thickening between sham and MI_NO_LVSD rabbits were observed at both stages using both cMRI and echo methods. cMRI data showed that MI_M_LVSD rabbits exhibited a reduction of ejection fraction (EF) and an increase in end-systolic volume (ESV) at the acute phase, while at the chronic stage these parameters did not change further. Moreover, in MI_S_LVSD animals, these observations were more striking at the acute stage followed by a further decline in EF and increase in ESV at the chronic stage. Lateral wall thickening determined by cMRI was significantly decreased in MI_M_LVSD versus MI_NO_LVSD animals at both stages (P<0.05).

Immunohistochemical results showed that C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown attenuated the expression of C/EBP\u03b2 protein as well as the expressions of collagen I, collagen III, MMP-2, MMP-9, and \u03b1-SMA in heart tissue sections from rats in the EAM + Lenti-shC/EBP\u03b2 group.Strategies targeted at inhibiting C/EBP\u03b2 expression can be potentially exploited to regulate cofilin and FLNA expression, thereby regulating actin polymerization/depolymerization, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and CF differentiation into CMF and the production of inflammatory cytokines. C/EBP\u03b2 knock down reduces the degree of inflammation-mediated myocardial fibrosis in a rat model of EAM.", "journal": "International heart journal", "date": "2018-10-12", "authors": ["XiuLi", "MenghuaSun", "SuzhenMen", "YananShi", "LijuanMa", "YongqiangAn", "YaqingGao", "HuiJin", "WeiLiu", "ZuoyiDu"], "doi": "10.1536/ihj.17-446"}
{"title": "Multiomics approach reveals metabolic changes in the heart at birth.", "abstract": "During late gestation, the fetal heart primarily relies on glucose and lactate to support rapid growth and development. Although numerous studies describe changes in heart metabolism to utilize fatty acids preferentially a few weeks after birth, little is known about metabolic changes of the heart within the first day following birth. Therefore, we used the ovine model of pregnancy to investigate metabolic differences between the near-term fetal and the newborn heart. Heart tissue was collected for metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic approaches from the left and right ventricles and intraventricular septum in 7 fetuses at gestational day 142 and 7 newborn lambs on the day of birth. Significant metabolites and lipids were identified using a Student's t-test, whereas differentially expressed genes were identified using a moderated t-test with empirical Bayes method [false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P < 0.10]. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to identify pathways enriched on a transcriptomic level (FDR-corrected P < 0.05), whereas overrepresentation enrichment analysis was used to identify pathways enriched on a metabolomic level ( P < 0.05). We observed greater abundance of metabolites involved in butanoate and propanoate metabolism, and glycolysis in the term fetal heart and differential expression in these pathways were confirmed with ssGSEA. Immediately following birth, newborn hearts displayed enrichment in purine, fatty acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways as well as oxidative phosphorylation with significant alterations in both lipids and metabolites to support transcriptomic findings. A better understanding of metabolic alterations that occur in the heart following birth may improve treatment of neonates at risk for heart failure.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In this study, an acquisition-reconstruction technique that makes use of the MB data to calculate these reference data is presented. The method was integrated into a 2D time-resolved phase-contrast MR sequence used to assess velocities of the myocardium.\nThe RF phases of the MB pulse are cycled through time so that consecutive cardiac phases can be grouped to form reference scans at a lower temporal resolution. These reference data are subsequently used to separate the original slices at the original, high temporal resolution using slice/split-slice GRAPPA algorithms. Slice separation performances are evaluated and compared with conventional methods at 3\u00a0T, and 3 different strategies for the calibration of the kernels are proposed and compared. Finally, 6 subjects were scanned to assess velocities of the myocardium.\nBecause the acquisition of external references is not needed, no additional breath-holds are required and the full MB acceleration could be exploited. Because the reference and MB data have the same resolution and phase structure, better slice separation was achieved when comparing the proposed technique to conventional workflows. Finally, time-resolved velocities of the myocardial tissue were successfully quantified from MB data, showing good agreement with single-band measurements.\nOur built-in reference method allows the full exploitation of the MB acceleration and it limits the number of breath-holds.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2018-10-09", "authors": ["GiulioFerrazzi", "Jean PierreBassenge", "ClarissaWink", "AlexanderRuh", "MichaelMarkl", "SteenMoeller", "Gregory JMetzger", "BerndIttermann", "SebastianSchmitter"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.27460"}

However, the connection between neuregulin-1 PLGA microparticles and inflammation is still not well characterised. In the present study we assessed this relationship in a mouse AMI model.

Usually, BC or BC-containing carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were recognized as non-directly toxic components of atmospheric particulate matter. However, epidemiology studies have provided much evidence of the associations of exposure of particulate-containing carbon particles with cardiovascular diseases. There are still no related studies to support the epidemiological conclusions. Hence, in this article we exposed adult zebrafish to CNPs for 60\u00a0days, and then explored the heart location and potential adverse effects on cardiac tissues of these nanosized carbon particles. Our results first showed direct visualization of cardiac endothelial uptake and heart deposition of CNPs in zebrafish. In addition, CNPs caused significant ultrastructural alterations in myocardial tissue and induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in sub-endocardial inflammation and cell apoptosis. Moreover, our data demonstrated the perturbations caused by CNPs on DNA methylation, suggesting that DNA methylome remodeling might play a critical role in CNP-induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish heart. Therefore, this study not only proved a laboratory link between CNP exposure and cardiotoxicity in vivo, but also indicated a possible toxicity mechanism involved.", "journal": "Journal of applied toxicology : JAT", "date": "2018-10-06", "authors": ["WeiZhou", "DongdongTian", "JunHe", "XiabeiYan", "JunZhao", "XiaoyanYuan", "ShuangqingPeng"], "doi": "10.1002/jat.3721"}

Precise spatiotemporal coordination between the different cardiogenic processes is ensured by intercellular signalling crosstalk and tissue-tissue interactions. Notch is an intercellular signalling pathway crucial for cell fate decisions during multicellular organismal development and is aptly positioned to coordinate the complex signalling crosstalk required for progressive cell lineage restriction during cardiogenesis. In this Review, we describe the role of Notch signalling and the crosstalk with other signalling pathways during the differentiation and patterning of the different cardiac tissues and in cardiac valve and ventricular chamber development. We examine how perturbation of Notch signalling activity is linked to congenital heart diseases affecting the neonate and adult, and discuss studies that shed light on the role of Notch signalling in heart regeneration and repair after injury.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

{"title": "The Role of Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) in Neurogenic Vasodilation and Its Cardioprotective Effects.", "abstract": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a highly potent vasoactive peptide released from sensory nerves, which is now proposed to have protective effects in several cardiovascular diseases. The major \u03b1-form is produced from alternate splicing and processing of the calcitonin gene. The CGRP receptor is a complex composed of calcitonin like receptor (CLR) and a single transmembrane protein, RAMP1. CGRP is a potent vasodilator and proposed to have protective effects in several cardiovascular diseases. CGRP has a proven role in migraine and selective antagonists and antibodies are now reaching the clinic for treatment of migraine. These clinical trials with antagonists and antibodies indicate that CGRP does not play an obvious role in the physiological control of human blood pressure. This review discusses the vasodilator and hypotensive effects of CGRP and the role of CGRP in mediating cardioprotective effects in various cardiovascular models and disorders. In models of hypertension, CGRP protects against the onset and progression of hypertensive states by potentially counteracting against the pro-hypertensive systems such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic system. With regards to its cardioprotective effects in conditions such as heart failure and ischaemia, CGRP-containing nerves innervate throughout cardiac tissue and the vasculature, where evidence shows this peptide alleviates various aspects of their pathophysiology, including cardiac hypertrophy, reperfusion injury, cardiac inflammation, and apoptosis. Hence, CGRP has been suggested as a cardioprotective, endogenous mediator released under stress to help preserve cardiovascular function. With the recent developments of various CGRP-targeted pharmacotherapies, in the form of CGRP antibodies/antagonists as well as a CGRP analog, this review provides a summary and a discussion of the most recent basic science and clinical findings, initiating a discussion on the future of CGRP as a novel target in various cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2018-10-05", "authors": ["ZizhengKee", "XeniaKodji", "Susan DBrain"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01249\n10.1016/0014-5793(86)81338-2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00874.2012\n10.1038/298240a0\n10.1016/0735-1097(91)90729-S\n10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00232-3\n10.1111/bph.13519\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028388\n10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00150-3\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2005.08.012\n10.1046/j.1365-201x.1999.00456.x\n10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00249-5\n10.1177/0333102414527646\n10.1002/prp2.52\n10.1124/mol.117.110916\n10.1016/S0165-5728(01)00475-1\n10.1152/physrev.00037.2003\n10.1038/313054a0\n10.1210/endo.140.6.6783\n10.1139/y96-112\n10.1038/39807\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000119\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0702975\n10.1177/41.10.8245413\n10.1016/j.peptides.2005.02.002\n10.1016/j.regpep.2004.01.011\n10.1016/S0167-0115(03)00124-1\n10.1111/head.13316\n10.2174/13892037113149990057\n10.1177/0333102418759786\n10.1001/jama.2018.4853\n10.1016/S1474-4422(14)70209-1\n10.14670/HH-16.1073\n10.1093/biolreprod/67.4.1321\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0703110\n10.1371/journal.pone.0188008\n10.1111/j.1527-3458.2005.tb00036.x\n10.1046/j.1468-2982.1995.1504272.x\n10.1007/s13311-017-0592-1\n10.1152/ajprenal.1990.258.1.F121\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1993.tb13878.x\n10.1074/jbc.M005604200\n10.1016/0140-6736(91)91944-P\n10.1016/0196-9781(87)90117-3\n10.1097/00004872-199102000-00013\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.054\n10.1007/BF02554909\n10.1093/cvr/24.3.239\n10.1016/0304-3940(85)90050-3\n10.1002/ana.410280213\n10.1056/NEJMoa1705848\n10.1007/BF01611735\n10.1111/bph.14075\n10.1212/WNL.0000000000000771\n10.1536/ihj.46.867\n10.1161/01.RES.63.4.726\n10.1007/BF00280942\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1967.tb01984.x\n10.1016/0022-4804(90)90192-5\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.04.004\n10.1161/01.RES.0000152969.42117.ca\n10.1254/jjp.79.221\n10.1002/cne.20794\n10.1016/0167-0115(85)90013-8\n10.1291/hypres.26.S105\n10.1038/ki.1989.183\n10.1074/jbc.M511147200\n10.1016/j.regpep.2013.06.008\n10.1097/00004872-200501000-00020\n10.1097/01.hjh.0000125409.50839.f1\n10.1139/y10-067\n10.1016/0014-2999(96)00426-8\n10.1111/j.1475-097X.1996.tb00557.x\n10.1097/01.CCM.0000134404.63292.71\n10.1016/j.regpep.2011.05.014\n10.1161/01.CIR.84.5.1993\n10.1016/0014-2999(85)90456-X\n10.1007/BF00506198\n10.1016/j.tips.2016.06.002\n10.1016/j.jash.2014.03.001\n10.1111/j.1365-2125.1988.tb05306.x\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.201434\n10.1097/00004872-199210120-00010\n10.1073/pnas.85.19.7366\n10.1038/30666\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01774.x\n10.1186/s10194-018-0848-0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00466.2010\n10.1016/S0028-3908(01)00176-9\n10.1016/0167-0115(85)90194-6\n10.1007/BF00370309\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.01.003\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.08-07-02468.1988\n10.1056/NEJMoa030505\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199703)247:3<388::AID-AR10>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1097/WCO.0000000000000548\n10.1097/00004872-199210000-00017\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.053\n10.1093/ajh/6.5.434\n10.1016/j.peptides.2011.03.004\n10.1002/prp2.191\n10.1007/s13311-018-0622-7\n10.1038/304129a0\n10.1016/S0940-9602(01)80176-X\n10.1152/physrev.00034.2013\n10.1007/s11886-014-0524-1\n10.1093/ajh/4.7.565\n10.1016/j.npep.2016.06.001\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.1.366\n10.1083/jcb.201603081\n10.1016/0002-9149(91)90531-O\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2018.04.007\n10.1210/endo-119-1-381\n10.1007/s10557-017-6716-3\n10.1016/j.npep.2010.12.002\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02517\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.03.056\n10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1212\n10.1042/cs0700389\n10.1161/01.HYP.21.6.1010\n10.1161/01.HYP.29.4.945\n10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00949-2\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060088\n10.1002/cne.902330410\n10.3892/ijmm.8.3.261\n10.1124/jpet.107.133868\n10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01760.x\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142819\n10.1113/JP270935\n10.1016/S0165-5728(02)00221-7\n10.1074/jbc.M116.751362\n10.1016/j.regpep.2004.12.008\n10.3969/j.issn.1673-5374.2013.10.009\n10.1042/bj2690775\n10.1038/bjp.2008.334\n10.1002/cphy.c120001"}

The heart has limited capacity of regeneration, therefore, transplantation is the only solution in some cases despite presenting many disadvantages. Tissue engineering has been considered the ideal strategy for regenerative medicine in cardiology. It is an interdisciplinary field combining many techniques that aim to maintain, regenerate or replace a tissue or organ. The main approach of cardiac tissue engineering is to create cardiac grafts, either whole heart substitutes or tissues that can be efficiently implanted in the organism, regenerating the tissue and giving rise to a fully functional heart, without causing side effects, such as immunogenicity. In this review, we systematically present and compare the techniques that have drawn the most attention in this field and that generally have focused on four important issues: the scaffold material selection, the scaffold material production, cellular selection and in vitro cell culture. Many studies used several techniques that are herein presented, including biopolymers, decellularization and bioreactors, and made significant advances, either seeking a graft or an entire bioartificial heart.

The current study is designed aiming at determining the effect of miR-223 on oxidative stress induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.\nMouse model of myocardial infarction (MI) was constructed, and endogenous level of miR-223 in the border zone of infarcted heart tissues was determined. Primarily cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed to H2O2 treatment to mimic the oxidative stress stimulation. Multiple approaches including quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), cell viability assay, luciferase assay, Western blot assay and flow cytometry assay were employed to determine its expression, function and mechanism in apoptosis.\nMiR-223 expression was significantly upregulated in the border zone of infarcted heart ventricular tissues and in cardiomyocytes treated with H2O2. Overexpression of miR-223 in cardiomyocytes promoted apoptosis, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR-223 protected cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced apoptosis. MiR-223 directly targets the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of Foxo3a mRNA. Overexpression of miR-223 inhibited Foxo3a protein expression, however, inhibition of miR-223 suppressed its expression. Silencing Foxo3a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) mimicked the effect of miR-223, indicating its functional significance.\nMiR-223 is an important regulator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis under oxidative stress.

It is noteworthy that most of these studies employ a means of preinjury application in experimental research and the preventive usage in clinical studies. Compared to pretreatment, postischemic administration of estrogen will be more practical in treating myocardial ischemia. On the other hand, defect in circadian clock gene period2 (Per2) has been shown to aggravate ischemia-induced heart damage. Given that Per2 expression decreases as a consequence of menopause, in this study, we aim to determine (1) potential improvement of myocardial function by postischemic administration of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) using an in\u00a0vivo mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model and (2) the role of E2 in regulating myocardial Per2 expression following I/R.\nThirty-minute occlusion of left anterior descending artery followed by 24-h reperfusion was performed on adult C57BL ovariectomized female mice. Groups (n\u00a0=\u00a03-6/group) were as follows: (1) Sham, (2) I/R\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, and (3) I/R\u00a0+\u00a0E2.

Importantly, postischemic treatment of E2 markedly restored I/R-depressed myocardial function, reduced caspase-3 activation, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). Intriguingly, a trend of the decreased Per2 level was observed in ovariectomized female hearts subjected to I/R, whereas E2 treatment upregulated myocardial Per2 expression.\nOur study represents the initial evidence that postischemic administration of E2 effectively preserves the myocardium against I/R injury and this protective effect of E2 may involve upregulation of Per2 in ischemic heart.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2018-10-04", "authors": ["YangYang", "I-WenWang", "MarkTurrentine", "MeijingWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2018.05.076"}
{"title": "Differential Effects of Normoxic and Hyperoxic Reperfusion on Global Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "The objectives were to investigate if after hypoxia or ischemia, normoxic reperfusion is associated with less oxidant stress (OS), inflammation, and myocardial injury than hyperoxic reperfusion. In this study, cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells) were cultured in hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation in normoxia or hyperoxia. Cardiomyocyte OS, inflammation, and apoptosis were measured. In parallel experiments, rabbits were cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Following cardioplegic arrest and aortic cross-clamp removal, hearts were reperfused under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. Left ventricular developed pressure and contractility (LV +dP/dt) were recorded, and blood samples and heart tissues were collected for measurement of OS, inflammation, and cardiac injury. Results showed that H9c2 cells exposed to hyperoxic reoxygenation showed significant increases in OS, inflammation, and apoptosis compared to normoxic reoxygenation. Following CPB and 2-hour hyperoxic reperfusion, LV +dP/dt and left ventricular developed pressure were significantly decreased compared with pre-CPB values (to 36 \u00b1 21%, P = 0.002; and 53 \u00b1 20%, P\u202f=\u202f0.02, respectively), associated with significant increases in all plasma and tissue biomarkers for OS, inflammation, and myocardial injury. In contrast, LV +dP/dt was relatively well preserved under normoxic reperfusion conditions (to 70 \u00b1 14% after 2-hour reperfusion), and was associated with an attenuated myocardial OS, inflammatory, apoptotic, and injury response compared to the hyperoxia group (eg, cTn-I: 5.9 \u00b1 1.5 vs 20.2 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.0001). Overall, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, normoxic reperfusion/reoxygenation was associated with less robust OS, inflammation, apoptosis, and myocardial injury compared with hyperoxic reperfusion/reoxygenation.

Next, we performed immunostaining for cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) protein, on the same sections, to co-localize miRNA-182 with the cardiomyocyte cells. Using this protocol, we were able to detect miRNA-182 through an alkaline phosphatase based colorimetric assay, and cTnT through fluorescent staining.

The deployment of these cells, with precise spatiotemporal regulation, is also important during development to establish the heart structure. In this Review, we discuss the diverse origins of cardiac cell types and the lineage relationships between cells of a given type that contribute to different parts of the heart. The emerging lineage tree shows the progression of cell fate diversification, with patterning cues preceding cell type segregation, as well as points of convergence, with overlapping lineages contributing to a given tissue. Several cell lineage markers have been identified. However, caution is required with genetic-tracing experiments in comparison with clonal analyses. Genetic studies on cell populations provided insights into the mechanisms for lineage decisions. In the past 3 years, results of single-cell transcriptomics are beginning to reveal cell heterogeneity and early developmental trajectories. Equating this information with the in vivo location of cells and their lineage history is a current challenge.

{"title": "A three-dimensional hybrid pacemaker electrode seamlessly integrates into engineered, functional human cardiac tissue in vitro.", "abstract": "Pacemaker systems are an essential tool for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the immune system's natural response to a foreign body results in the encapsulation of a pacemaker electrode and an impaired energy efficiency by increasing the excitation threshold. The integration of the electrode into the tissue is affected by implant properties such as size, mechanical flexibility, shape, and dimensionality. Three-dimensional, tissue-like electrode scaffolds render an alternative to currently used planar metal electrodes. Based on a modified electrospinning process and a high temperature treatment, a conductive, porous fiber scaffold was fabricated. The electrical and immunological properties of this 3D electrode were compared to 2D TiN electrodes. An increased surface of the fiber electrode compared to the planar 2D electrode, showed an enhanced electrical performance. Moreover, the migration of cells into the 3D construct was observed and a lower inflammatory response was induced. After early and late in vivo host response evaluation subcutaneously, the 3D fiber scaffold showed no adverse foreign body response. By embedding the 3D fiber scaffold in human cardiomyocytes, a tissue-electrode hybrid was generated that facilitates a high regenerative capacity and a low risk of fibrosis.

However, tissue processing is required for its use in humans due to the presence of animal antigens. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the structural integrity and biocompatibility of the bovine pericardium (BP) after a soft decellularization process with a 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, with the aim to remove xenoantigens and preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) bioactivity. The decellularization process promoted a mean reduction of 77% of the amount of DNA in the samples in which cell nuclei staining was undetectable. The ECM content was maintained as mostly preserved after decellularization as well as its biomechanical properties. In addition, the decellularization protocol has proven to be efficient in removing the xenoantigen alpha-gal, which is responsible for immune rejection. The decellularized BP was noncytotoxic in vitro and allowed human adipose-derived stem cell (hASC) adhesion. Finally, after 7\u00a0days in culture, the tissue scaffold became repopulated by hASCs, and after 30\u00a0days, the ECM protein pro-collagen I was seen in the scaffold. Together, these characteristics indicated that soft BP decellularization with 0.1% SDS solution allows the acquirement of a bioactive scaffold suitable for cell repopulation and potentially useful for regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Xenotransplantation", "date": "2018-09-29", "authors": ["Marina AugustoHeuschkel", "AmandaLeitolis", "Jo\u00e3o GabrielRoderjan", "Paula HansenSuss", "C\u00e9sar Augusto OleinikLuzia", "Francisco Diniz Affonsoda Costa", "AlejandroCorrea", "Marco AugustoStimamiglio"], "doi": "10.1111/xen.12464"}

In this study, using conventional and qRT-PCR, we report the expression of transcripts for various sarcomeric TPM isoforms in striated muscles through development. Transcripts of both TPM1\u03b1 and TPM1\u03ba, the two sarcomeric isoforms of the TPM1 gene, are expressed in embryonic chicken hearts but disappear in post hatch stages. TPM1\u03b1 transcripts are expressed in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle. The sarcomeric isoform of the TPM2 gene is expressed mostly in embryonic skeletal muscles. As reported earlier, TPM3\u03b1 is expressed in embryonic heart and skeletal muscle but significantly lower in adult striated muscle. TPM4\u03b1 transcripts are expressed from embryonic to adult chicken hearts but not in skeletal muscle. Our 2D Western blot analyses using CH1 monoclonal antibody followed by mass spectra evaluations found TPM4\u03b1 protein is the major sarcomeric tropomysin expressed in embryonic chicken hearts. However, in 7-day-old embryonic hearts, a minute quantity of TPM1\u03b1 or TPM1\u03ba is also expressed. This finding suggests that sarcomeric TPM1 protein may play some important role in cardiac contractility and/or cardiac morphogenesis during embryogenesis.

{"title": "Modulation of age related protein expression changes by gelam honey in cardiac mitochondrial rats.", "abstract": "Aging is characterized by progressive decline in biochemical and physiological functions. According to the free radical theory of aging, aging results from oxidative damage due to the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are the main source of ROS production and are also the main target for ROS. Therefore, a diet high in antioxidant such as honey is potentially able to protect the body from ROS and oxidative damage. Gelam honey is higher in flavonoid content and phenolic compounds compared to other local honey. This study was conducted to determine the effects of gelam honey on age related protein expression changes in cardiac mitochondrial rat. A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into two groups: the young group (2\u202fmonths old), and aged group (19\u202fmonths old). Each group were then subdivided into two groups: control group (force-fed with distilled water), and treatment group (force-fed with gelam honey, 2.5\u202fg/kg), and were treated for 8\u202fmonths. Comparative proteomic analysis of mitochondria from cardiac tissue was then performed by high performance mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LCMS/MS) followed by validation of selected proteins by Western blotting. Proteins were identified using Spectrum Mill software and were subjected to stringent statistical analysis. A total of 286 proteins were identified in the young control group (YC) and 241 proteins were identified in the young gelam group (YG). In the aged group, a total of 243 proteins were identified in control group (OC), and 271 proteins in gelam group (OG).

Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) have central roles in modulating cardiac function under pathophysiological conditions. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a self-protective role in counteracting CF dysfunction. However, the precise function of CF-specific ATF3 during myocardial infarction (MI) injury/repair remains incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether CF-specific ATF3 affected cardiac repair after MI.\nFifteen male C57BL/6 wild-type mice were performed with MI operation to observe the expression of ATF3 at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 7.0 days postoperation. Model for MI was constructed in ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre+ (CF-specific ATF3 overexpression group, n = 5) and ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre- male mice (without CF-specific ATF3 overexpression group, n = 5). In addition, five mice of ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre+ and ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre- were subjected to sham MI operation. Heart function was detected by ultrasound and left ventricular remodeling was observed by Masson staining (myocardial fibrosis area was detected by blue collagen deposition area) at the 28\nAfter establishment of an MI model, we found that ATF3 proteins were increased in the heart of mice after MI surgery and dominantly expressed in CFs. Genetic overexpression of ATF3 in CFs (ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre+ group) resulted in an improvement in the heart function as indicated by increased cardiac ejection fraction (41.0% vs. 30.5%, t = 8.610, P = 0.001) and increased fractional shortening (26.8% vs. 18.1%, t = 7.173, P = 0.002), which was accompanied by a decrease in cardiac scar area (23.1% vs. 11.0%, t = 8.610, P = 0.001). qRT-PCR analysis of CFs isolated from ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre+ and ATF3TGfl/flCol1a2-Cre- ischemic hearts revealed a distinct transcriptional profile in ATF3-overexpressing CFs, displaying pro-proliferation properties. BrdU-positive cells significantly increased in ATF3-overexpressing CFs than control CFs under angiotensin II stimuli (11.5% vs. 6.8%, t = 31.599, P = 0.001) or serum stimuli (31.6% vs. 20.1%, t = 31.599, P = 0.001).

Significant post-myocardial infarction related loss of cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue, and their subsequent replacement with fibrous scar tissue, negatively impacts endogenous tissue repair and regeneration capabilities. To overcome such limitations, tissue engineers are working toward developing a 3D cardiac patch which not only mimics the structural, functional, and biological hierarchy of the native cardiac tissue, but also could deliver autologous stem cells and encourage their homing and differentiation. In this study, we examined the utility of electrospun, randomly-oriented, type-I collagen nanofiber (dia = 789 \u00b1 162 nm) mats on the cardiomyogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) spheroids, in the presence or absence of 10 \u03bcM 5-azacytidine (aza). Results showed that these scaffolds are biocompatible and enable time-dependent evolution of early (GATA binding protein 4: GATA4), late (cardiac troponin I: cTnI), and mature (myosin heavy chain: MHC) cardiomyogenic markers, with a simultaneous reduction in CD90 (stemness) expression, independent of aza-treatment. Aza-exposure improved connexin-4 expression and sustained sarcomeric \u03b1-actin expression, but provided only transient improvement in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) expression.

However, genetic models of SGLT1 inactivation indicate that the malfunction of these transporters may have adverse effects on various tissues. In this review, we discuss the available evidence on the beneficial and detrimental effects that the inhibition of SGLT1 transporters might have. The inhibition of SGLT1 lowers serum glucose levels through the inhibition of intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of glucose. In addition, drugs that interfere with SGLT1-mediated transport of glucose may protect cardiac tissue by reducing glycogen accumulation and decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species. On the other hand, this strategy may result in diarrhea, volume depletion, may interfere with the correction of hypoglycemia through the oral administration of carbohydrates and could predispose to the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.

Recently, cellular therapies have emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for restoration of lost cardiomyocytes or their rejuvenation after cardiac damage and injuries. Harnessing the biological properties of ECM could be a viable strategy to enhance the therapeutic effects of cellular therapies by improving the engraftment, integration, survival, and functional adaptation of newly transplanted cells in many different platforms. Conversely, transplanted cells could restore the functionality and original composition of damaged ECM by secreting and depositing new ECM or stimulating normal ECM production by cardiac tissue native cells. Although the ultimate role of cell therapy in treatment of cardiac disorders is still a matter of great debate, the potential utility of ECM in improving the therapeutic effect of transplanted cells and vice versa the potential role of cell therapy as a means to restore the structure and functionality of damaged ECM should be carefully considered in implementation of future clinical cardiovascular cell therapy trials.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2018-09-22", "authors": ["PeimanHematti"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-97421-7_9"}

{"title": "Whole Cardiac Tissue Bioscaffolds.", "abstract": "Bioscaffolds serve as structures for cells in building complex tissues and full organs including heart. Decellularizing cardiac tissue results in cell-free extracellular matrix (ECM) that can be used as a cardiac tissue bioscaffold. The field of whole-heart tissue engineering has been revolutionized since the 2008 publication of the first perfusion-decellularized whole heart, and since then, studies have shown how decellularized cardiac tissue retains its native architecture and biochemistry following recellularization. Chemical, enzymatic, and physical decellularization methods preserve the ECM to varying degrees with the widely accepted standard of less than 50 ng/mg of double-stranded DNA present in decellularized ECM. Following decellularization, replacement of cells occurs via recellularization: seeding cells into the decellularized ECM structure either via perfusion of cells into the vascular conduits, injection into parenchyma, or a combination of perfusion and injection. Endothelial cells are often perfused through existing vessel conduits to provide an endothelial lining of the vasculature, with cardiomyocytes and other parenchymal cells injected into the myocardium of decellularized ECM bioscaffolds. Uniform cell density and cell retention throughout the bioscaffold still needs to be addressed in larger animal models of the whole heart. Generating the necessary cell numbers and types remains a challenge. Still, recellularized cardiac tissue bioscaffolds offer therapeutic solutions to heart failure, heart valve replacement, and acute myocardial infarction. New technologies allow for decellularized ECM to be bioprinted into cardiac bioscaffolds or formed into a cardiac hydrogel patch.

These signals have been shown to influence many fundamental cardiac cell behaviors including contractility, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Consequently, alterations to cell phenotype result in directed remodeling of the cECM. This bidirectional communication means that the cECM can be envisioned as a medium for information storage. As a result, the reprogramming of the cECM is increasingly being employed in tissue engineering and regenerative\u00a0medicine as a method with which to treat disease. In this chapter, an overview of the composition and structure of the cECM as well as its role in cardiac development and disease will be provided.

Recently, more evidence suggests that cardiac ECM plays an active role in cardiac remodeling in response to mechanical loads. To that end, we provide an overview of the structure and function of the heart and the currently available in vivo and ex vivo mechanical measurements of cardiac tissues. We also review the biomechanical properties of cardiac tissues including the myocardium and heart valves, with a discussion on the differences between the right ventricle and left ventricle. Lastly, we go into the mechanical factors involved in cardiac remodeling and review the mechanobiology of cardiac tissues, i.e., the biomechanical responses at the cellular and tissue level, with an emphasis on the impact on the cardiac ECM. The regulation of cardiac ECM on cell function, which is a new and open area of research, is also briefly discussed.

Over the years, many approaches have been developed to assess PMI, but their time frame of applicability has been only days to weeks. Our present pilot study aimed to find the sensitive mRNA marker if the degradation of mRNA could be used to estimate the early postmortem interval (up to 24\u202fh).\nIn our study, we use the microarray to screen 217 mRNAs markers of rat cardiac tissue. Then, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to validate of the candidate markers at 7 time points within 24\u202fh and at temperatures of 25\u202f\u00b0C and 35\u202f\u00b0C. Another 27 rats were then used to verify the model.\nAmong all of the candidate markers, \u25b3Cq (cell division cycle 25 homolog B(Cdc25b)) had the best correlation coefficient with early postmortem interval and was used to build a new model using the R software. The results of verification testing demonstrated that the error rate was less than 15%, demonstrating the high predictive power of our mathematical model.\nIn this study, Cdc25b was found to be the sensitive marker to estimate early postmortem interval, and Rpl27 was found to be suitable for use as the endogenous control.

{"title": "Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response mediated the protective effect of tanshinone IIA on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a potent and widely used anticancer agent, can give rise to severe cardiotoxicity that limits its clinical use by inducing oxidative stress. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is the central regulator of cellular responses to electrophilic/oxidative stress, which serves a critical role in maintenance of normal cardiac function. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) has previously been reported to protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether Nrf2 signaling serves a role in the underlying mechanism. In the animal model, DOX induced acute cardiotoxicity, whereas Tan IIA pretreatment reduced the activity of myocardial enzymes, and increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, Tan IIA pretreatment (3-10 \u00b5M) significantly increased the cell viability and markedly restored morphological changes in DOX-injured H9c2 cells, decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species, and increased the level of intracellular GSH. Additionally, Tan IIA pretreatment also induced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and its downstream genes heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit in both the mice cardiac tissues and H9c2 cells. Nrf2 knockdown by small interfering RNA downregulated Tan IIA-induced Nrf2 activation and reversed the effect of Tan IIA on the DOX-induced inhibition of cell viability. These results suggest that the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response mediates the protective effect of Tan IIA on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2018-09-21", "authors": ["ZhaohuiGuo", "MiaoYan", "LeiChen", "PingfeiFang", "ZhihuaLi", "ZimengWan", "SisiCao", "ZhenyanHou", "ShanshanWei", "WenqunLi", "BikuiZhang"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2018.6614\n10.1155/2018/7582730\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.06.1167\n10.1002/14651858.CD005006.pub2\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.03.023\n10.1002/med.21280\n10.3390/nu7064938\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2199\n10.1155/2013/104308\n10.1124/pr.110.004333\n10.1016/j.fct.2008.06.086\n10.1093/abbs/gmt082\n10.1517/13543776.2013.743995\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.041\n10.1016/j.fct.2009.03.038\n10.1016/j.phymed.2016.02.022\n10.1208/s12248-014-9666-8\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1155/2018/1483041\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045037\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.02.010\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.06.013\n10.1080/14728222.2016.1250887\n10.2174/1568026615666150220114417\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01567.x\n10.1155/2014/748524\n10.1194/jlr.M040394\n10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.05.012\n10.1080/02652048.2017.1311955\n10.1038/srep17536\n10.1002/jps.24210\n10.1016/j.taap.2012.05.014\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.02.088\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2384\n10.1371/journal.pone.0119214\n10.1080/00498250902951763\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.09.037\n10.3892/etm.2011.441\n10.1002/jcb.24553\n10.1007/s12012-012-9177-8"}

Estrogen deficiency augments cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress and, thereby, aggravates myocardial fibrosis (MF) and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive female rats. However, estrogen replacement therapy has no effect on myocardial infarction and cardiac fibrosis in postmenopausal women. Further clinical studies showed that high blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes is an important cause of MF, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. To experimentally address this issue, diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by injecting streptozotocin and administering a high-fat diet in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. High degrees of fibrosis and apoptosis were detected in the cardiac tissue of these rats, together with increased expression of iNOS. Further treatment with the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) agonist G1 decreased iNOS expression and the apoptosis rate in cardiac tissue significantly and inhibited cardiac fibroblast (CF) proliferation. Similar trends were observed in cultured CFs treated with high concentrations of fat and glucose. In addition, treatment with the iNOS-specific inhibitor W1400 attenuated iNOS and vimentin expression, which is associated with a marked reduction in MF. These results suggest that GPR30 activation inhibits MF in diabetic OVX female rats by suppressing cardiac iNOS activity and consequently NO levels.

{"title": "sox9b is required in cardiomyocytes for cardiac morphogenesis and function.", "abstract": "The high mobility group transcription factor SOX9 is expressed in stem cells, progenitor cells, and differentiated cell-types in developing and mature organs. Exposure to a variety of toxicants including dioxin, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate, and chlorpyrifos results in the downregulation of tetrapod Sox9 and/or zebrafish sox9b. Disruption of Sox9/sox9b function through environmental exposures or genetic mutations produce a wide range of phenotypes and adversely affect organ development and health. We generated a dominant-negative sox9b (dnsox9b) to inhibit sox9b target gene expression and used the Gal4/UAS system to drive dnsox9b specifically in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific inhibition of sox9b function resulted in a decrease in ventricular cardiomyocytes, an increase in atrial cardiomyocytes, hypoplastic endothelial cushions, and impaired epicardial development, ultimately culminating in heart failure. Cardiomyocyte-specific dnsox9b expression significantly reduced end diastolic volume, which corresponded with a decrease in stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. Further analysis of isolated cardiac tissue by RT-qPCR revealed cardiomyocyte-specific inhibition of sox9b function significantly decreased the expression of the critical cardiac development genes nkx2.5, nkx2.7, and myl7, as well as c-fos, an immediate early gene necessary for cardiomyocyte progenitor differentiation.

This can be observed in vitro, where muscle cell behaviour is influenced by the particular culture substrates and whether culture is performed in a 2D or 3D environment, with changes including morphology, nuclear shape and cytoskeletal organization. To create a 3D skeletal muscle model we compared collagen I, Fibrin or PEG-Fibrinogen with different sources of murine and human myogenic cells. To generate tension in the 3D scaffold, biomaterials were polymerised between two flexible silicone posts to mimic tendons. This 3D culture system has multiple advantages including being simple, fast to set up and inexpensive, so providing an accessible tool to investigate myogenesis in a 3D environment. Immortalised human and murine myoblast lines, and primary murine satellite cells showed varying degrees of myogenic differentiation when cultured in these biomaterials, with C2 myoblasts in particular forming large multinucleated myotubes in collagen I or Fibrin.

{"title": "Chitosan/silk fibroin modified nanofibrous patches with mesenchymal stem cells prevent heart remodeling post-myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Poor functional survival of the engrafted stem cells limits the therapeutic efficacy of stem-cell-based therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac patch-based system for cardiac repair has emerged as a potential regenerative strategy for MI. This study aimed to design a cardiac patch to improve the retention of the engrafted stem cells and provide mechanical scaffold for preventing the ventricular remodeling post-MI. The patches were fabricated with electrospinning cellulose nanofibers modified with chitosan/silk fibroin (CS/SF) multilayers via layer-by-layer (LBL) coating technology. The patches engineered with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) (cell nano-patch) were adhered to the epicardium of the infarcted region in rat hearts. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed higher cell viability in the cell nano-patch group compared with the intra-myocardial injection group. Echocardiography demonstrated less ventricular remodeling in cell nano-patch group, with a decrease in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic volume compared with the control group. Additionally, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening were elevated after cell nano-patch treatment compared with the control group. Histopathological staining demonstrated that cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis were attenuated, while local neovascularization was promoted in the cell nano-patch group. Western blot analysis illustrated that the expression of biomarkers for myocardial fibrosis (TGF-\u03b21, P-smad3 and Smad3) and ventricular remodeling (BNP, \u03b2-MHC: \u03b1-MHC ratio) were decreased in cell nano patch-treated hearts. This study suggests that CS/SF-modified nanofibrous patches promote the functional survival of engrafted AD-MSCs and restrain ventricular remodeling post-MI through attenuating myocardial fibrosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: First, the nanofibrous patches fabricated from the electrospun cellulose nanofibers could mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of hearts to improve the microenvironment post-MI and provide three dimensional (3D) scaffolds for the engrafted AD-MSCs. Second, CS and SF which have exhibited excellent properties in previous tissue engineering research, such as nontoxicity, biodegradability, anti-inflammatory, strong hydrophilic nature, high cohesive strength, and intrinsic antibacterial properties further optimized the biocompatibility of the nanofibrous patches via LBL modification. Finally, the study revealed that beneficial microenvironment and biomimetic ECM improve the retention and viability of the engrafted AD-MSCs and the mechanical action of the cell nano-patches for the expanding ventricular post-MI leads to suppression of HF progression by inhibition of ventricular remodeling.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2018-09-16", "authors": ["JiangweiChen", "YingfeiZhan", "YabinWang", "DongHan", "BoTao", "ZhenliLuo", "SaiMa", "QunWang", "XiangLi", "LiFan", "CongyeLi", "HongbingDeng", "FengCao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2018.09.013"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective cytokine interleukin-33 is up-regulated by statins in human cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family and is able to act cardioprotective. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of IL-33 by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and bisphosphonates (BPs) in human cardiac tissue. The lipophilic fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin as well as the nitrogenous BPs alendronate and ibandronate, but not hydrophilic pravastatin increased IL-33 mRNA and intracellular IL-33 protein levels in both human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) and fibroblasts (HACF). Additionally, fluvastatin reduced soluble ST2 secretion from HACM. IL-33 was also up-regulated by the general inhibitor of prenylation perillic acid, a RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and by latrunculin B, but statin-induced IL-33 expression was inhibited by mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and RhoA activator U-46619. The IL-33 promoter was 2.3-fold more accessible in statin-treated HACM compared to untreated cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037). In explanted hearts of statin-treated patients IL-33 protein was up-regulated as compared with the hearts of non-statin-treated patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048). As IL-33 was previously shown to exert cardioprotective effects, one could speculate that such up-regulation of IL-33 expression in human cardiac cells, which might happen mainly through protein geranylgeranylation, could be a novel mechanism contributing to known cardioprotective effects of statins and BPs.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2018-09-15", "authors": ["RichardPentz", "ChristophKaun", "BarbaraThaler", "StefanStojkovic", "MaxLenz", "Konstantin AKrychtiuk", "AndreasZuckermann", "KurtHuber", "JohannWojta", "Philipp JHohensinner", "SvitlanaDemyanets"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.13891\n10.1093/cvr/cvy166"}

This led us to hypothesize that phosphate deficiency altered the circadian cycle in peripheral tissues. Analysis of the expression of the central clock genes over a 24-36\u2009hour period in multiple peripheral tissues including fracture callus, proximal tibia growth plate and cardiac tissues after 12 days on a low phosphate diet showed higher levels of gene expression in the hypophosphatemia groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a 3 to 6\u2009hour elongation of the circadian cycle. A comparative analysis of the callus tissue transcriptome genes that were differentially regulated by hypophosphatemia with published data for the genes in bone that are diurnally regulated identified 1879 genes with overlapping differential regulation, which were shown by ontology assessment to be associated with oxidative metabolism and apoptosis. Network analysis of the central circadian pathway genes linked their expression to the up regulated expression of the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2, a gene that when mutated in both humans and mice controls overall skeletal growth.

{"title": "CCBE1 is required for coronary vessel development and proper coronary artery stem formation in the mouse heart.", "abstract": "Proper coronary vasculature development is essential for late-embryonic and adult heart function. The developmental regulation of coronary embryogenesis is complex and includes the coordinated activity of multiple signaling pathways. CCBE1 plays an important role during lymphangiogenesis, enhancing VEGF-C signaling, which is also required for coronary vasculature formation. However, whether CCBE1 plays a similar role during coronary vasculature development is still unknown. Here, we investigate the coronary vasculature development in Ccbe1 mutant embryos.\nWe show that Ccbe1 is expressed in the epicardium, like Vegf-c, and also in the sinus venosus (SV) at the stages of its contribution to coronary vasculature formation. We also report that absence of CCBE1 in cardiac tissue inhibited coronary growth that sprouts from the SV endocardium at the dorsal cardiac wall. This disruption of coronary formation correlates with abnormal processing of VEGF-C propeptides, suggesting VEGF-C-dependent signaling alteration. Moreover, Ccbe1 loss-of-function leads to the development of defective dorsal and ventral intramyocardial vessels. We also demonstrate that Ccbe1 mutants display delayed and mispatterned coronary artery (CA) stem formation.\nCCBE1 is essential for coronary vessel formation, independent of their embryonic origin, and is also necessary for peritruncal vessel growth and proper CA stem patterning.

In this regard, bioengineered cardiac tissues are of particular importance due to the extremely limited ability of the myocardium to self-regenerate, as well as the remarkably high mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases worldwide. As novel microphysiological systems make the transition from bench to bedside, their implementation in high throughput drug screening, personalized diagnostics, disease modeling, and targeted therapy validation will bring forth a paradigm shift in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases.

{"title": "Synchronization of Triggered Waves in Atrial Tissue.", "abstract": "When an atrial cell is paced rapidly, calcium (Ca) waves can form on the cell boundary and propagate to the cell interior. These waves are referred to as \"triggered waves\" because they are initiated by Ca influx from the L-type Ca channel and occur during the action potential. However, the consequences of triggered waves in atrial tissue are not known. Here, we develop a phenomenological model of Ca cycling in atrial myocytes that accounts for the formation of triggered waves. Using this model, we show that a fundamental requirement for triggered waves to induce abnormal electrical activity in tissue is that these waves must be synchronized over large populations of cells. This is partly because triggered waves induce a long action potential duration (APD) followed by a short APD. Thus, if these events are not synchronized between cells, then they will on average cancel and have minimal effects on the APD in tissue. Using our computational model, we identify two distinct mechanisms for triggered wave synchronization. The first relies on cycle length (CL) variability, which can prolong the CL at a given beat. In cardiac tissue, we show that CL prolongation leads to a substantial amplification of APD because of the synchronization of triggered waves. A second synchronization mechanism applies in a parameter regime in which the cell exhibits stochastic alternans in which a triggered wave fires, on average, only every other beat. In this scenario, we identify a slow synchronization mechanism that relies on the bidirectional feedback between the APD in tissue and triggered wave initiation. On large cables, this synchronization mechanism leads to spatially discordant APD alternans with spatial variations on a scale of hundreds of cells. We argue that these spatial patterns can potentially serve as an arrhythmogenic substrate for the initiation of atrial fibrillation.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2018-09-10", "authors": ["YohannesShiferaw", "Gary LAistrup", "John AWasserstrom"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.015"}

A type 9 recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV9) was employed to manipulate miR-217 expression in mice with thoracic aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac structure and function were measured by echocardiography and invasive pressure-volume analysis. The expression levels of miR-217 were increased in hearts from both CHF patients and TAC mice. Overexpression of miR-217 in\u00a0vivo aggravated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction, whereas miR-217-TUD-mediated downregulation of miR-217 reversed these effects. PTEN was predicted and validated as a direct target of miR-217, and re-expression of PTEN attenuated miR-217-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction.

Its expression has also been detected in non-cardiac tissues. However, there is no report so far about the distribution and function of corin in aorta and in related diseases such as atherosclerosis. This study was the first to explore corin expression in aorta both under normal conditions and in atherosclerosis models. In\u00a0vivo, we found corin had a basal level of expression in aortas, mainly in intimal endothelial cells and was significantly elevated in mouse atherosclerosis model. Moreover, we observed pro-ANP, the specific substrate of corin, was also expressed in mice aortas and increased in mouse atherosclerosis model. In\u00a0vitro, we further demonstrated corin expression in cultured vascular endothelial cells and its induced expression after ox-LDL stimulation. Our results suggested that corin may play important roles in aorta physiology and in the pathophysiological process of atherosclerosis in an autocrine manner and has potential clinical value for the treatment of atherosclerosis.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2018-09-10", "authors": ["JingjingJiang", "QuanZhou", "MingchengSun", "FuwenZuo", "JingjingJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.173"}

We map out the fluorescently labeled actin cytoskeleton in heart tissue cells and superimpose the data with phase maps from X-ray holography. Furthermore, an array of local far-field diffraction patterns is recorded in the regime of small-angle X-ray scattering (scanning SAXS), which can be interpreted in terms of biomolecular shape and spatial correlations of all contributing scattering constituents.

However, because DNA and nucleic acid vaccines produce less than optimal responses in humans, our strategy relies on administering a recombinant protein-based vaccine, together with adjuvants that promote Th1-type immunity. Here we describe a process for the purification and refolding of recombinant TSA-1 expressed in Escherichia coli. The overall yield (20-25%) and endotoxin level of the purified recombinant TSA-1 (rTSA-1) is suitable for pilot scale production of the antigen for use in phase 1 clinical trials. Mice infected with T. cruzi were treated with rTSA-1, either alone or with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) agonist adjuvants including monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA, IDRI), and E6020 (EISEI, Inc). TSA-1 with the TLR-4 agonists was effective at reducing parasitemia relative to rTSA-1 alone, although it was difficult to discern a therapeutic effect compared to treatment with TLR-4 agonists alone. However, rTSA-1 with a 10 ug dose of MPLA optimized reductions in cardiac tissue inflammation, which were significantly reduced compared to MPLA alone. It also elicited the lowest parasite burden and the highest levels of TSA-1-specific IFN-gamma levels and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratios.

We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging of hearts from in vivo myocardial infarction mouse models. In these mice, myocardial ischemia was induced by blood supply restriction via a permanent ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery. We showed that applying the machine learning algorithm of gradient boosting tree ensemble to the ambient mass spectrometry imaging data allows us to distinguish segments of infarcted myocardium from normally perfused hearts on a pixel by pixel basis. The machine learning algorithm selected 62 molecular ion peaks important for classification of each 200 \u03bcm-diameter pixel of the cardiac tissue map as normally perfused or ischemic. This approach achieved very high average accuracy (97.4%), recall (95.8%), and precision (96.8%) at a spatial resolution of \u223c200 \u03bcm. In addition, we determined the chemical identity of 27 species, mostly small metabolites and lipids, selected by the algorithm as the most significant for cardiac pathology classification.

Previous versions of the cardiac patch strategy improve stem cell engraftment and encourage repair of cardiac tissue. However, cardiac patches that can enhance cardiomyogenesis and angiogenesis at the injured site remain elusive. Therapies that target cardiomyocyte proliferation and new blood vessel formation hold great potential for the protection against acute myocardial infarction (MI). Here, we report a new strategy for creating a vascularized cardiac patch in a facile and modular fashion by leveraging microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing to construct the biomimetic microvessels (BMVs) that include human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) lining the luminal surface and then encapsulating the BMVs in a fibrin gel spiked with human CSCs. We show that the endothelialized BMVs mimicked the natural architecture and function of capillaries and that the resultant vascularized cardiac patch (BMV-CSC patch) exhibited equivalent release of paracrine factors compared to those of coculture of genuine human CSCs and HUVECs after 7 days of in vitro culture. In a rat model of acute MI, the BMV-CSC patch therapy induced profound mitotic activities of cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct region 4 weeks post-treatment. A significant increase in myocardial capillary density was noted in the infarcted hearts that received BMV-CSC patch treatment compared to the infarcted hearts treated with conventional CSC patches. The striking therapeutic benefits and the fast and facile fabrication of the BMV-CSC patch make it promising for practical applications.

A cardiac patch approach aims at regenerating an infracted heart by providing healthy functional cells to the injured region via a film carrier substrate, and providing mechanical and electrical support. Selenium acts as an important element in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases but their health-related effects have not been fully explored. Limitation is the fact that cardiac electrophysiology was only globally personalized, thus missing the potential localized pathological features in vivo. The epidemiological aspects of plasma levels of selenium and other lipid parameters in cardiomyopathy patients (30 nos) from South Tamilnadu, India were studied. The epidemiological data showed significant differences between plasma selenium, Glutathione per oxidase (Gpx) and High reactive-C Protein in cardiomyopathy patients when compared to the control. As a novel approach, in the present study chitosan-Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) film was used to produce electrical conductivity in the cardiac patches. The prepared chitosan-SeNPs film was characterized by Scanning Electron microscopy with Energy Dispersive X ray spectrum (SEM-EDX). The electrical and mechanical properties of the chitosan-SeNPs film were also studied.

{"title": "The interstitium in cardiac repair: role of the immune-stromal cell interplay.", "abstract": "Cardiac regeneration, that is, restoration of the original structure and function in a damaged heart, differs from tissue repair, in which collagen deposition and scar formation often lead to functional impairment. In both scenarios, the early-onset inflammatory response is essential to clear damaged cardiac cells and initiate organ repair, but the quality and extent of the immune response vary. Immune cells embedded in the damaged heart tissue sense and modulate inflammation through a dynamic interplay with stromal cells in the cardiac interstitium, which either leads to recapitulation of cardiac morphology by rebuilding functional scaffolds to support muscle regrowth in regenerative organisms or fails to resolve the inflammatory response and produces fibrotic scar tissue in adult mammals. Current investigation into the mechanistic basis of homeostasis and restoration of cardiac function has increasingly shifted focus away from stem cell-mediated cardiac repair towards a dynamic interplay of cells composing the less-studied interstitial compartment of the heart, offering unexpected insights into the immunoregulatory functions of cardiac interstitial components and the complex network of cell interactions that must be considered for clinical intervention in heart diseases.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

{"title": "Rat atrial engineered heart tissue: a new in vitro model to study atrial biology.", "abstract": "Engineered heart tissue (EHT) from rat cells is a useful tool to study ventricular biology and cardiac drug safety. Since atrial and ventricular cells differ significantly, EHT and other 3D cell culture formats generated from ventricular cells have been of limited value to study atrial biology. To date, reliable in vitro models that reflect atrial physiology are lacking. Therefore, we established a novel EHT model using rat atrial cells (atrial EHT, aEHT) to assess atrial physiology, contractility and drug response. The tissue constructs were characterized with regard to gene expression, histology, electrophysiology, and the response to atrial-specific drugs. We observed typical functional properties of atrial tissue in our model such as more regular spontaneous beating with lower force, shorter action potential duration, and faster contraction and relaxation compared to ventricular EHT (vEHT). The expression of atrial-specific genes and proteins was high, whereas ventricle-specific transcripts were virtually absent. The atrial-selective drug carbachol had a strong negative inotropic and chronotropic effect on aEHT only. Taken together, the results demonstrate the feasibility of aEHT as a novel atrial 3D model and as a benchmark for tissue engineering with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial-like cardiomyocytes.

Melatonin as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent is known for protection of normal tissues against ionizing irradiation. In addition, some studies have suggested that Melatonin may have some anti-cancer properties. Although the complete mechanisms remain unknown, it can act via immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with melatonin on oxidative damage caused by direct irradiation and bystander effects on the lung and heart tissue after xenograft mice colon cancer irradiation in Balb/c mice.\nForty nine (49) Balb/c mice were evenly divided into 7 groups including control, irradiation of 5 Gy directly to tumor, melatonin treatment (20 mg/kg) and irradiation (5 Gy single fraction) directly to tumor, irradiation of 5 Gy directly to chest area, melatonin treatment (20 mg/kg) and radiation directly to chest, only melatonin treatment and whole-body scatter group (which gave radiation dose equal to the amount of radiation that the lung had received from the localized pelvic irradiation) to evaluate the effect of melatonin on the MDA level as well as SOD and GPx activity after 24 and 72 h of irradiation of 5 Gy single fraction directly to the tumor tissue and chest area, in the tumor tissue, the lung tissue, and the heart tissue.\nThe results revealed that exposure to irradiation resulted in an increase in MDA level and suppressed SOD and GPx activity in the targeted and non-targeted lung and heart tissues, and the tumor tissue. Melatonin decreased MDA level in the lung and heart tissues. Also, melatonin improved SOD and GPx activity in non-targeted tissues, while it was able to reduce these two enzymes and decreased MDA level in the tumor tissue.\nMelatonin exhibited its ability to ameliorate oxidative stress in both targeted and nontargeted tissues.

{"title": "Monitoring sublethal changes in fish physiology following exposure to a light, unweathered crude oil.", "abstract": "Biomarkers are frequently used to determine the exposure of fish to petroleum hydrocarbons following an oil spill. These biomarkers must be chosen carefully if they are to be used to determine sublethal toxic impacts as well as oil exposure. Many commonly used biomarkers relate to the metabolism of high molecular weight, typically pyrogenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are not abundant in unweathered crude oil. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of different biomarkers, including histological examination and transcriptomic profiling, in showing exposure to oil and the potential for sublethal toxic impacts. To achieve these goals, subadults/adults of the spotted dragonet (Repomucenus calcaratus) were exposed to a representative light, unweathered Australian oil for 96\u2009h, so that the physiological changes that occur with exposure could be documented. Fish were then transferred to clean sediment for 90\u2009h to quantify recovery. Biomarker changes, including PAH metabolites, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), and histopathology, are presented in this work. In addition, a de novo transcriptome for the spotted dragonet was assembled, and differential transcript abundance was determined for the gill and liver of petroleum-exposed fish relative to a control. Increased levels of some biliary phenanthrene metabolites were seen throughout the exposure period. EROD levels showed modest, but not significant, increases. Transcriptomic differences were noted in the abundances of transcripts with a role in inflammation, primary metabolism and cardiac function. The patterns of transcript abundance in the gill and the liver changed in a manner that reflected exposure and recovery. The histology showed elevated prevalence of lesions, most notably vacuolization in liver and heart tissue, multi-organ necrosis, and lamellar epithelial lifting and telangiectasia in the gill. These findings suggest that short-term exposures to low molecular weight PAHs could elicit changes in the health of fish that are well predicted by the transcriptome. Furthermore, when light oil is released into the environment, exposure and subsequent risk would be better estimated using phenanthrene metabolite levels rather than EROD. This study also adds to the weight of evidence that exposure to low molecular weight PAHs may cause cardiac problems in fish. Further study is needed to determine the impact of these changes on reproductive capacity, long-term survival, and other population specific parameters.", "journal": "Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2018-09-03", "authors": ["Sharon EHook", "JulieMondon", "Andrew TRevill", "Paul AGreenfield", "Sarah AStephenson", "JoannaStrzelecki", "PatriciaCorbett", "EmilyArmstrong", "JingSong", "HaiDoan", "SkyeBarrett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.08.013"}

However, for a substantial proportion of ARVC patients, the genetic substrate remains unknown. We hypothesized that plectin, a cytolinker protein encoded by the PLEC gene, could play a role in ARVC because it has been proposed to link the desmosomal protein desmoplakin to the cytoskeleton and therefore has a potential function in the desmosomal structure.\nWe screened PLEC in 359 ARVC patients and compared the frequency of rare coding PLEC variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.001) between patients and controls. To assess the frequency of rare variants in the control population, we evaluated the rare coding variants (MAF <0.001) found in the European cohort of the Exome Aggregation Database. We further evaluated plectin localization by immunofluorescence in a subset of patients with and without a PLEC variant.\nForty ARVC patients carried one or more rare PLEC variants (11%, 40/359).

{"title": "Whole grain intake associated molecule 5-aminovaleric acid betaine decreases \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids in mouse cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Despite epidemiological evidence showing that diets rich in whole grains reduce the risk of chronic life-style related diseases, biological mechanisms for these positive effects are mostly unknown. Increased 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB) levels in plasma and metabolically active tissues such as heart have been associated with consumption of diets rich in whole grains. However, biological effects of 5-AVAB are poorly understood. We evaluated 5-AVAB concentrations in human and mouse heart tissue (3-22\u2009\u00b5M and 38-78\u2009\u00b5M, respectively) using mass spectrometry. We show that 5-AVAB, at physiological concentration range, dose-dependently inhibits oxygen consumption due to \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, but does not otherwise compromise mitochondrial respiration, as measured with oxygen consumption rate in cultured mouse primary cardiomyocytes. We also demonstrate that this effect is caused by 5-AVAB induced reduction of cellular L-carnitine. Reduced L-carnitine levels are at least partly mediated by the inhibition of cell membrane carnitine transporter (OCTN2) as evaluated by in silico docking, and by siRNA mediated silencing of OCTN2 in cultured cardiomyocytes. 5-AVAB caused inhibition of \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is a novel mechanism on how diets rich in whole grains may regulate energy metabolism in the body.

{"title": "Molecular discoveries and treatment strategies by direct reprogramming in cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue has minimal endogenous regenerative capacity in response to injury. Treatment options are limited following tissue damage after events such as myocardial infarction. Current strategies are aimed primarily at injury prevention, but attention has been increasingly targeted toward the development of regenerative therapies. This review focuses on recent developments in the field of cardiac fibroblast reprogramming into induced cardiomyocytes. Early efforts to produce cardiac regeneration centered around induced pluripotent stem cells, but clinical translation has proved elusive. Currently, techniques are being developed to directly transdifferentiate cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes. Viral vector-driven expression of a combination of transcription factors including Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 induced cardiomyocyte development in mice. Subsequent combinational modifications have extended these results to human cell lines and increased efficacy. The miRNAs including combinations of miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, and miR-499 can improve or independently drive regeneration of cardiomyocytes. Similar results could be obtained by combinations of small molecules with or without transcription factor or miRNA expression.

{"title": "Hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts from failing human hearts decrease cardiomyocyte beating frequency in an ALOX15 dependent manner.", "abstract": "A common denominator for patients with heart failure is the correlation between elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adverse clinical outcomes. Furthermore, lipoxygenase-induced inflammation is reportedly involved in the pathology of heart failure. Cardiac fibroblasts, which are abundant in cardiac tissue, are known to be activated by inflammation. We previously showed high expression of the lipoxygenase arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), in ischemic cardiac tissue. The exact roles of ALOX15 and 15-HETE in the pathogenesis of heart failure are however unknown. Biopsies were collected from all chambers of explanted failing human hearts from heart transplantation patients, as well as from the left ventricles from organ donors not suffering from chronic heart failure. Biopsies from the left ventricles underwent quantitative immunohistochemical analysis for ALOX15/B. Gene expression of ALOX enzymes, as well as 15-HETE levels, were examined in cardiac fibroblasts which had been cultured in either hypoxic or normoxic conditions after isolation from failing hearts. After the addition of fibroblast supernatants to human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, intracellular calcium concentrations were measured to examine the effect of paracrine signaling on cardiomyocyte beating frequency. While ALOX15 and ALOX15B were expressed throughout failing hearts as well as in hearts from organ donors, ALOX15 was expressed at significantly higher levels in donor hearts. Hypoxia resulted in a significant increase in gene and protein expression of ALOX15 and ALOX15B in fibroblasts isolated from the different chambers of failing hearts. Finally, preconditioned medium from hypoxic fibroblasts decreased the beating frequency of human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells in an ALOX15-dependent manner. In summary, our results demonstrate that ALOX15/B signaling by hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts may play an important role in ischemic cardiomyopathy, by decreasing cardiomyocyte beating frequency.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-08-24", "authors": ["MikaelSandstedt", "VictoriaRotter Sopasakis", "AnnikaLundqvist", "KristinaVukusic", "AndersOldfors", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "JoakimSandstedt", "Lillemor MattssonHult\u00e9n"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0202693\n10.1007/s10495-013-0946-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0161629\n10.1084/jem.20082596\n10.2337/db13-1896\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.09.033\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.01.015\n10.1021/cr200246d\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.117\n10.1371/journal.pone.0043142\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02223.x\n10.1007/s00395-014-0428-7\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1182/blood-2009-09-241802\n10.1074/jbc.M303857200\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2007.10.027\n10.1002/jcb.24098\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160549\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.163956\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.09.019\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.4155/fmc.14.129\n10.1021/jm401915r\n10.1161/01.STR.0000249004.25444.a5\n10.1016/j.bmc.2006.01.057\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1186/1471-2199-10-94\n10.1016/j.plipres.2010.10.005\n10.1007/s00109-015-1314-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.00906.2009\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi190\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61198-1"}
{"title": "Cardiomyocytes cultured on mechanically compliant substrates, but not on conventional culture devices, exhibit prominent mitochondrial dysfunction due to reactive oxygen species and insulin resistance under high glucose.", "abstract": "Diabetes causes cardiac dysfunction, and understanding of its mechanism is still incomplete. One reason could be limitations in modeling disease conditions by current in vitro cardiomyocyte culture. Emerging evidence suggests that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment affect cardiomyocyte function. Nevertheless, the impact of high glucose on cardiomyocytes cultured on substrates whose stiffness matches that of the heart (approximately 15 kPa) is untested.\nTo test the hypothesis that cardiomyocytes cultured in microenvironments that mimic the mechanical properties of those for cardiomyocytes in vivo may reproduce the pathophysiology characteristics of diabetic cardiomyocytes ex vivo, such as the morphological appearance, ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.\nIsolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were seeded on 15 kPa polyacrylamide (PAA) gels, whose stiffness mimics that of heart tissues, or on glass coverslips, which represent conventional culture devices but are unphysiologically stiff. Cells were then cultured at 5 mM glucose, corresponding to the normal blood glucose level, or at high glucose levels (10 to 25 mM). Cytoskeletal disorganization, ROS accumulation, attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuated ATP level caused by high glucose and their reversal by a ROS scavenger were prominent in cells on gels, but not in cells on coverslips. The lack of response to ROS scavenging could be attributable to enhanced apoptosis in cells on glass, shown by enhanced DNA fragmentation and higher caspase 3/7 activity in cells on glass coverslips. High-glucose treatment also downregulated GLUT4 expression and attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake only in cells on 15 kPa gels.\nOur data suggest that a mechanically compliant microenvironment increases the susceptibility of primary cardiomyocytes to elevated glucose levels, which enables these cells to serve as an innovative model for diabetic heart research.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-08-24", "authors": ["MasakiMorishima", "KazukiHorikawa", "MakotoFunaki"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0201891\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.679597\n10.1007/s11154-010-9131-7\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.014\n10.1038/nrendo.2015.216\n10.1002/jbt.10081\n10.1152/ajpheart.00638.2014\n10.1038/nature01246\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.08.009\n10.1080/19336918.2015.1005469\n10.1152/ajpheart.00515.2010\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.023\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05091.x\n10.1111/jcmm.12027\n10.1253/circj.CJ-15-1276\n10.1002/cm.20041\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.05.017\n10.1074/jbc.M101087200\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.203\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310738\n10.1007/978-1-61779-523-7_20\n10.1007/978-1-62703-604-7_4\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.016\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv134\n10.1113/JP273607\n10.1038/322754a0\n10.1038/356722a0\n10.1210/jc.2005-1904\n10.1152/ajpcell.00331.2011\n10.1210/en.2016-1960\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006382"}

Acetylation of mitochondrial proteins has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction (ischemia-reperfusion) and heart failure. Indeed, over 60% of mitochondrial proteins contain acetylation sites, and most of these proteins are involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondrial non-enzymatic acetylation is enabled by acetyl-coenzyme A abundance and serves as the primary pathway of acetylation in mitochondria. Hence, regulation of enzymatic deacetylation becomes the most important mechanism to control acetylation/deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins.

{"title": "A complex micellar system co-delivering curcumin with doxorubicin against cardiotoxicity and tumor growth.", "abstract": "Dose-dependent irreversible cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) becomes a major obstacle for the clinical use. Nowadays much attention is being paid to combination therapy with DOX and antioxidant agents, which would improve the clinical efficacy by protecting from cardiotoxicity along with the maintained performance as an antitumor drug. With the assistance of nanoscience and polymer engineering, herein a complex polymeric micellar system was developed for co-loading DOX and a premium natural antioxidant curcumin (CUR), and we investigated whether this new formulation for DOX delivery could achieve such a goal.\nThe dually loaded micelles co-encapsulating DOX and CUR (CPMDC) were prepared through thin-film rehydration by using the amphiphilic diblock copolymer monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)-N-t-butoxycarbonyl-phenylalanine (BP) synthesized by end-group modification of mPEG-PCL with BP. Quantitative analysis was conducted by HPLC methods for drugs in micelles or biosamples. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed using HyperChem software to illustrate interactions among copolymer and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The safety and antitumor efficacy were evaluated by in vitro viability of H9C2 cells, and tumor growth inhibition in tumor-bearing mice respectively. The protection effects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity were investigated according to several physiological, histopathological and biochemical markers concerning systemic and cardiac toxicity.\nCPMDC were obtained with favorable physicochemical properties meeting the clinical demand, including uniform particle size, fairly high encapsulation efficiency and drug loadings, as well as good drug release profiles and colloidal stability. The result from molecular dynamics simulation indicated a great impact of the interactions among copolymer and small molecules on the ratiometrical co-encapsulation of both drugs. MTT assay of in vitro H9C2 cells viability demonstrated good safety of the CPMDC formulation, which also showed definite signs of decrease in xenograft tumor growth. The studies on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution further revealed that DOX delivered by CPMDC could result in prolonged systemic circulation and increased DOX accumulation in tumor but decreased level of the toxic metabolite doxorubicinol in heart tissue compared to free DOX alone or the cocktail combination.\nThe findings from present study substantiated that such a complex micellar system codelivering DOX with CUR does produce the effect of killing two birds with one stone via distinctive nanocarrier-modified drug-drug interactions.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2018-08-22", "authors": ["DiZhang", "QianXu", "NingWang", "YantingYang", "JiaqiLiu", "GuohuaYu", "XinYang", "HuiXu", "HongboWang"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S170067"}

Segments of ventricular myocardium that act as substrates for ventricular tachycardia can be identified by the use of invasive mapping techniques or non-invasive ECG incorporating multi-electrode body surface recordings and cardiac imaging. Early case series have demonstrated a consistent decrease in VT burden and sufficient acute safety to expand to more detailed multicenter studies. As VT substrates can be closely related to critical structures such as the epicardial coronary vessels and the conduction system, the late effects of radiation to these structures is of concern. Modeling radiation dose to these structures has a potentially important role in application of this new technology.

{"title": "Loss of long non-coding RNA CRRL promotes cardiomyocyte regeneration and improves cardiac repair by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA.", "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the development of myocardial hypertrophy and may stimulate endogenous myocardial regeneration to prevent heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). However, whether lncRNAs are involved in regulating myocardial regeneration after MI remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify human-derived lncRNAs that are involved in endogenous cardiomyocyte (CM) regeneration. By analyzing publicly available RNA-seq data of human fetal and normal adult cardiac tissues, we identified a novel human-derived adult upregulated lncRNA designated cardiomyocyte regeneration-related lncRNA (CRRL). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that CRRL is involved in the negative regulation of CM proliferation. First, we observed that the loss of CRRL attenuates post-MI remodeling and preserves cardiac function in adult rats. Through loss-of-function approaches, we found that CRRL knockdown promotes neonatal rat CM proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CRRL acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly binding to miR-199a-3p and thereby increasing the expression of Hopx, a target gene of miR-199a-3p and a critical negative regulatory factor of CM proliferation. Thus, CRRL suppresses cardiomyocyte regeneration by directly binding to miR-199a-3p, indicating that loss of CRRL facilitates myocardial regeneration and may be a new potential therapeutic strategy for heart failure.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-08-21", "authors": ["GuojunChen", "HairuiLi", "XinzhongLi", "BingLi", "LintaoZhong", "SenlinHuang", "HaoZheng", "MengshaLi", "GuoqingJin", "WangjunLiao", "YulinLiao", "YanmeiChen", "JianpingBin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.08.013"}

Human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are isolated and used to generate a cell suspension with 70% iPSC-CMs, 15% HCFs, and 15% HUVECs. They are co-cultured in an ultra-low attachment \"hanging drop\" system, which contains micropores for condensing hundreds of spheroids at one time. The cells aggregate and spontaneously form beating spheroids after 3 days of co-culture. The spheroids are harvested, seeded into a novel mold cavity, and cultured on a shaker in the incubator. The spheroids become a mature functional tissue approximately 7 days after seeding. The resultant multilayered tissues consist of fused spheroids with satisfactory structural integrity and synchronous beating behavior.

We investigated the distribution of natriuretic peptides and their receptors in goat (Capra hircus) heart tissue using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) immunohistochemical method. Strong staining of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was observed in atrial cardiomyocytes, while strong staining for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was observed in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Slightly stronger cytoplasmic C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) immunostaining was detected in the ventricles compared to the atria. Natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) immunoreactivity was more prominent in the atria, while natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) immunoreactivity was stronger in the ventricles. Cytoplasmic natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) immunoreactivity was observed in both the atria and ventricles, although staining was more prominent in the ventricles. ANP immunoreactivity ranged from weak to strong in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelial cells exhibited moderate to strong BNP immunoreactivity, while vascular smooth cells displayed weak to strong staining. Endothelial cells exhibited weak to strong cytoplasmic CNP immunoreactivity. Vascular smooth muscle cells were labeled moderately to strongly for CNP. Weak to strong cytoplasmic NPR-A immunoreactivity was found in the endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells stained weakly to moderately for NPR-A. Endothelial and vascular smooth cells exhibited weak to strong cytoplasmic NPR-B immunoreactivity. Moderate to strong NPR-C immunoreactivity was observed in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells.

Due to the improvements in design and materials, and to the changing of clinical features of patients treated for valvular heart disease the distance between the ideal valve and the available prostheses has been shortened. We will then deal with the developing of new tools aiming at replacing or repair cardiac tissues that still represent an unmet clinical need for the surgeons and indeed for their patients. In the effort of improving treatment for the cardiovascular disease (CVD), scientists struggle with the lack of self-regenerative capacities of finally differentiated cardiovascular tissues. In this context, using several converging technological approaches, regenerative medicine moves beyond traditional transplantation and replacement therapies and can restore tissue impaired function. It may also play an essential role in surgery daily routine, leading to produce devices such as injectable hydrogels, cardiac patches, bioresorbable stents and vascular grafts made by increasingly sophisticated biomaterial scaffolds; tailored devices promptly fabricated according to surgeon necessity and patient anatomy and pathology will hopefully represent a daily activity in the next future.

{"title": "Interfacial tissue engineering of heart regenerative medicine based on soft cell-porous scaffolds.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), occurs when the coronary artery is occluded resulting in the hypoxia of areas in heart tissue, is increasing in recent years because of the population ageing and lifestyle changes. Currently, there is no ideal therapeutic scheme because of the limitation of MI therapeutic strategies due to the lack of regenerative ability of the heart cells in adult humans. Recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine brings hope to the MI therapy and current studies are focusing on restoring the function and structure of damaged tissue by delivering exogenous cells or stimulating endogenous heart cells. However, attempts to directly inject stem cells or cardiomyocytes to the infract zone often lead to rapid cell death and abundant cell loss. To address this challenge, various soft repair cells and porous scaffold materials have been integrated to improve cell retention and engraftment and preventing left ventricle (LV) dilatation. In this article, we will review the current method for heart regeneration based on soft cell-porous scaffold interfacial tissue engineering including common stem cell types, biomaterials, and cardiac patch and will discuss potential future directions in this area.", "journal": "Journal of thoracic disease", "date": "2018-08-21", "authors": ["XiwenGeng", "BingLiu", "JiaqingLiu", "DongLiu", "YupengLu", "XiaotianSun", "KangLiang", "BiaoKong"], "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2018.01.117\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.165\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1016/0002-8703(92)90649-G\n10.1089/ten.teb.2015.0523\n10.1590/S1679-45082015RW3154\n10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70522-9\n10.1155/2015/734731\n10.1089/ars.2014.6063\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16626-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.734103\n10.1002/ccd.20406\n10.1073/pnas.78.12.7634\n10.1006/dbio.1994.1146\n10.1002/mrd.1080360404\n10.1073/pnas.92.17.7844\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1038/nrm1744\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00392-1\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81769-9\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9912\n10.1152/jappl.2002.92.1.288\n10.1073/pnas.0603916103\n10.4161/cc.7.24.7189\n10.1093/cvr/cvr138\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.09.001\n10.1023/A:1024709332039\n10.1096/fj.06-6769com\n10.1096/fj.06-6769com\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.778795\n10.1007/s12265-010-9233-3\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.008\n10.1089/scd.2008.0247\n10.1038/nature09805\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1073/pnas.0706760104\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1172/JCI12150\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.05.034\n10.1186/scrt29\n10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.004\n10.1016/j.healun.2006.04.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0504\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.05.026\n10.1007/s10856-010-4131-4\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.032\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.09.012\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1002/jbm.a.35232\n10.1002/jbm.b.31386\n10.1093/icvts/ivt277\n10.1073/pnas.1004097107\n10.1155/2015/685690\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.07.010\n10.1002/adfm.201002434\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.055\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn009\n10.1021/bm401679q\n10.1038/srep03733\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1367\n10.1007/s12015-010-9131-8\n10.1161/01.RES.0000173376.39447.01\n10.1253/circj.CJ-14-0973\n10.7150/thno.16866\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0132\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.930404\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0312\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.108\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.030\n10.1038/am.2014.56\n10.1021/jacs.5b01747\n10.1021/ja501517h\n10.1002/adma.201602335\n10.1002/ange.201704120\n10.1016/j.apmt.2017.12.009\n10.1111/1440-1681.12529\n10.1002/term.1460\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0105\n10.1038/nature15372\n10.1016/j.cossms.2003.12.004\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.04.025\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.084\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.004\n10.1096/fj.06-7117com\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.052\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.08.034\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.029\n10.1002/term.1944\n10.1038/nprot.2008.183"}

{"title": "Search of Somatic Mutations of NKX2-5 and GATA4 Genes in Chinese Patients with Sporadic Congenital Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) usually occurs sporadically, with only a minority of cases associated with a known genetic mechanism. Cardiac-specific transcription factors NKX2-5 and GATA4 play key roles in the mammalian heart development, and the affected cardiac tissues of CHD patients are prone to somatic mutations which thus participate in the pathogenesis of CHD. We collected 98 patients with sporadic CHD, extracted genomic DNA from cardiac tissues and blood, and then screened NKX2-5 and GATA4 genes using PCR-direct sequence analysis. A novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.907G\u00a0>\u00a0A, p.V303I) of NKX2-5 gene was identified in a patient with tetralogy of Fallots. Functional assay revealed that this mutant was associated with significantly reduced transcriptional activity. In addition, we found two known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2277923, rs3729753) in NKX2-5 and two known SNPs (rs56166237, rs3729856) in GATA4. All variations identified in cardiac tissues were consistent with those of peripheral blood, and no somatic mutations were found in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Cardiac procholecystokinin expression during haemodynamic changes in the mammalian heart.", "abstract": "Cardiac myocytes express the cholecystokinin gene (CCK) at propeptide level. We recently reported that cardiac CCK expression is acutely regulated by isoprenaline in a porcine model. The regulation of CCK expression after myocardial infarction, in exercise, and in severe heart failure is, however, unknown. Cardiac tissue was obtained from healthy new-born and adolescent farm pigs. Myocardial infarction was induced by coronary artery occlusion in adult minipigs. Healthy male subjects performed a 3-hour exercise test, and patients with severe heart failure referred for right heart catheterization were included. Extracts of porcine cardiac tissue and human plasma were analysed with specific proCCK radioimmunoassays. Cardiac proCCK expression shifted from the right atrium in new-born piglets to include the left atrium in adolescent pigs. Regional proCCK expression in the adolescent pig heart was mainly confined to the atria without different expression in sinus node tissue. In adult minipigs with myocardial infarction, no changes in overall left ventricular function or proCCK expression were observed after 8 weeks. In healthy adults, proCCK in circulation increased markedly during exercise in parallel with pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Finally, patients with severe heart failure displayed markedly increased proCCK - but not CCK - concentrations in plasma. Taken together, our data shows that regional proCCK expression reflects haemodynamic changes in the mammalian heart. The data supports the notion that cardiac CCK expression resembles that of cardiac natriuretic peptides in atria. The ventricular content of proCCK, however, differs from natriuretic peptides and suggests a distinct secretory pathway in ventricular cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2018-08-20", "authors": ["Jens PGoetze", "IngridHunter", "Nora EZois", "DijanaTerzic", "NanaValeur", "L HOlsen", "JulieSmith", "PeterPlomgaard", "Lasse HHansen", "Jens FRehfeld", "LBalling", "FinnGustafsson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2018.08.004"}

AC9 is highly expressed in vital organs such as the heart and the brain. Here, we report that the isoform-specific carboxyl-terminal domain (C2b) of AC9 inhibits the activation of the enzyme by Gs-coupled receptors (GsCR). In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably overexpressing AC9, cAMP production by AC9 induced upon the activation of endogenous \u03b2-adrenergic and prostanoid GsCRs was barely discernible. Cells expressing AC9 lacking the C2b domain showed a markedly enhanced cAMP response to GsCR. Subsequent studies of the response of AC9 mutants to the activation of GsCR revealed that residues 1268-1276 in the C2b domain were critical for auto-inhibition. Two main species of AC9 of 130\u202fK and\u202f\u2265\u202f170\u202fK apparent molecular weight were observed on immunoblots of rodent and human myocardial membranes with NH", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2018-08-20", "authors": ["AdriennP\u00e1lv\u00f6lgyi", "JamesSimpson", "IbolyaBodn\u00e1r", "JuditB\u00edr\u00f3", "Mikl\u00f3sPalkovits", "Tam\u00e1sRadovits", "PaulSkehel", "Ferenc AAntoni"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.08.010"}
{"title": "Natriuretic peptides in human heart: Novel insight into their molecular forms, functions, and diagnostic use.", "abstract": "Among the three natriuretic peptides, atrial/A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain/B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are primarily produced by, and secreted from, heart tissue. They maintain cardiovascular homeostasis by binding to natriuretic peptide receptor-A. Since plasma ANP and BNP concentrations, as well as expression, are elevated in response to increased body fluid volume and pressure load on the heart wall, these peptides are widely utilized as diagnostic biomarkers for evaluating heart failure. Regardless of their high utility, differences in their molecular forms between healthy and diseased subjects and how these relate to pathophysiology have not well been examined. Recent studies have shown that the circulating molecular forms of ANP and BNP are not uniform; bioactive \u03b1-ANP is the major ANP form, whereas the weakly active proBNP is the major BNP form. The relative ratios of the different molecular forms are altered under different pathophysiological conditions. These facts indicate that detailed measurements of each form may provide useful information on the pathophysiological state of heart tissue. Here, we revisit the relationship between the molecular forms of, and pathophysiological alterations in, human ANP and BNP and discuss the possible utility of the measurement of each of the molecular forms. The third peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide, activates natriuretic peptide receptor-B, but little is known about its production and function in the heart because of its extremely low levels. However, through recent studies, its role in the heart is gradually becoming clear.

Surgical intervention to restore normal function includes the implantation of synthetic and biological materials; however, a lack of experimental data describing the mechanical behaviour of neonatal cardiac tissue is likely to contribute to the relatively poor short- and long-term outcome of these implants. This study focused on characterising the mechanical behaviour of neonatal cardiac tissue using a porcine model, to enhance the understanding of how this differs to the equivalent mature tissue. The biomechanical properties of neonatal porcine cardiac tissue were characterised by uniaxial tensile, biaxial tensile, and simple shear loading modes, using samples collected from the anterior and posterior walls of the right and left ventricles. Histological images were prepared using Masson's trichrome staining, to enable assessment of the microstructure and correlation with tissue behaviour. The mechanical tests demonstrated that the neonatal cardiac tissue is non-linear, anisotropic, viscoelastic and heterogeneous. Our data provide a baseline describing the biomechanical behaviour of immature porcine cardiac tissue. Comparison with published data also indicated that the neonatal porcine cardiac tissue exhibits one-half the stiffness of mature porcine tissue in uniaxial extension testing, one-third in biaxial extension testing, and one-fourth stiffness in simple shear testing; hence, it provides an indication as to the relative change in characteristics associated with tissue maturation. These data may prove valuable to researchers investigating neonatal cardiac mechanics.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2018-08-18", "authors": ["FaizanAhmad", "Ra JPrabhu", "JunLiao", "ShweSoe", "Michael DJones", "JonathanMiller", "ParkerBerthelson", "DanielEnge", "Katherine MCopeland", "SamarShaabeth", "RichardJohnston", "IanMaconochie", "Peter STheobald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.07.038"}

{"title": "LC-MS analysis of key components of the glutathione cycle in tissues and body fluids from mice with myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress is suggested to play an important role in several pathophysiological conditions. A recent study showed that decreasing 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamate) concentration, an important mediator of oxidative stress, by over-expressing 5-oxoprolinase, improves cardiac function post-myocardial infarction in mice. The aim of the current study is to gain a better understanding of the role of the glutathione cycle in a mouse model of myocardial infarction by establishing quantitative relationships between key components of this cycle. We developed and validated an LC-MS method to quantify 5-oxoproline, L-glutamate, reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized GSH (GSSG) in different biological samples (heart, kidney, liver, plasma, and urine) of mice with and without myocardial infarction. 5-oxoproline concentration was elevated in all biological samples from mice with myocardial infarction. The ratio of GSH/GSSG was significantly decreased in cardiac tissue, but not in the other tissues/body fluids. This emphasizes the role of 5-oxoproline as an inducer of oxidative stress related to myocardial infarction and as a possible biomarker. An increase in the level of 5-oxoproline is associated with a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio, a well-established marker for oxidative stress, in cardiac tissue post-myocardial infarction. This suggests that 5-oxoproline may serve as an easily measurable marker for oxidative stress resulting from cardiac injury. Our findings show further that liver and kidneys have more capacity to cope with oxidative stress conditions in comparison to the heart, since the GSH/GSSG ratio is not affected in these organs despite a significant increase in 5-oxoproline.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis", "date": "2018-08-17", "authors": ["AndresGil", "Atzevan der Pol", "Petervan der Meer", "RainerBischoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jpba.2018.08.001"}

Methods Twenty-eight male rats were randomly assigned to four groups including (1) the control group; (2) the ADR group, which received ADR intravenously at the beginning of the study and the (3) ZM+ADR and (4) CAR+ADR groups, which received ZM and CAR by gavage for 28 consecutive days and ADR as single dose. Blood samples were collected on days 0 and 28 to determine serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Also, cardiac tissue was removed for redox marker evaluation. Results In the ADR group, malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total thiol contents significantly reduced, as compared with the control group, while CAR administration significantly improved this condition. Treatment with ZM significantly increased the SOD activity and total thiol content, as compared with the ADR group. The level of LDH significantly increased on day 28 in the ADR group compared to the control group, and administration of ZM and CAR significantly decreased it. The SGPT and SGOT levels in the ADR group significantly increased, and CAR administration significantly reduced them. Conclusion The results indicate that the administration of ZM hydroalcoholic extracts and its active ingredient, CAR, could reduce the oxidative stress damage through promotion of the cardiac and systemic antioxidant system.

{"title": "The effect of different digoxin concentrations on heart tissue and antioxidant status in iron-overloaded rats.", "abstract": "Thalassaemia is a hereditary disorder and has an economic burden on patients and the government. The most prevalent complication in these patients is iron overload which is followed by cardiomyopathy. Digoxin is considered as a treatment against heart failure in thalassaemia. The present study evaluated the effect of two digoxin concentrations on iron content and antioxidative defense in cardiac tissue of iron-overloaded rats.\nThe study was conducted on 48 rats which were divided into 6 groups. Group 1 was the control group and did not receive any treatment and group 2 was the iron overload group. In addition groups 3 and 4 were the digoxin control groups which received 1 and 5 mg/kg/day of digoxin, respectively. Groups 5 and 6 received 1 and 5 mg/kg/day of digoxin plus iron-dextran, respectively. After 1 month, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and total antioxidant status (TAS) were assessed in cardiac tissues.\nCo-administration of iron-dextran and digoxin (1 and 5 mg/kg/day) significantly increased SOD and TAS levels (P < 0.0010) and reduced MDA (P < 0.0010) in heart tissue compared to control and iron overload groups. GPX levels significantly reduced in groups 5 and 6 (iron + digoxin 1 (P < 0.0500) and iron + digoxin 5) (P < 0.0010) compared to the iron control group.\nDigoxin remarkably facilitates iron uptake by cardiomyocytes by affecting other channels such as L-type and T-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC and TTCC). Digoxin administration in the iron-overloaded rat model deteriorated antioxidative parameters and increased iron entry into heart tissue at higher doses. Therefore, in patients with beta thalassaemia major, digoxin must be administered with great care and serum iron and ferritin must be regularly monitored.", "journal": "ARYA atherosclerosis", "date": "2018-08-16", "authors": ["BeydolahShahouzehi", "Hamid RezaNasri", "YaserMasoumi-Ardakani"], "doi": "10.22122/arya.v14i2.1642"}

{"title": "Integration of \"omics\" techniques: Dronedarone affects cardiac remodeling in the infarction border zone.", "abstract": "Dronedarone improves microvascular flow during atrial fibrillation and reduces the infarct size in acute models of myocardial infarction. However, dronedarone might be harmful in patients with recent decompensated heart failure and increases mortality in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. A pathophysiological explanation for these discrepant data is lacking. This study investigated the effects of dronedarone on gene and protein expression in the infarcted area and border zone in pigs subjected to anterior ischemia/reperfusion myocardial infarction. The ischemia/reperfusion myocardial infarction was induced in 16 pigs. Eight pigs were treated with dronedarone for 28 days after myocardial infarction, the remaining pigs served as control. Microarray-based transcriptome profiling and 2D-DIGE-based proteome analysis were used to assess the effects of dronedarone on left ventricular gene expression in healthy (LV), infarcted (MI), and border zone tissue. Selected targets were validated by RT-qPCR or immunoblot analyses, with special emphasize given to the transcriptome/proteome overlap. Combined \"omics\" analysis was performed to identify most significant disease and function charts affected by dronedarone and to establish an integrated network. The levels of 879 (BZ) or 7 (MI) transcripts and 51 (LV) or 15 (BZ) proteins were significantly altered by dronedarone, pointing to a substantial efficacy of dronedarone in the border zone. Transcriptome and proteome data indicate that dronedarone influences post-infarction remodeling processes and identify matricellular proteins as major targets of dronedarone in this setting. This finding is fully supported by the disease and function charts as well as by the integrated network established by combined \"omics\". Dronedarone therapy alters myocardial gene expression after acute myocardial infarction with pronounced effects in the border zone. Dronedarone promotes infarct healing via regulation of periostin and might contribute to the limitation of its expansion as well as cardiac rupture. Thus, there are no experimental hints that dronedarone per se has direct harmful effects after MI in ventricular tissue. Impact statement Dronedarone reduced the infarct size in models of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Here, we show that dronedarone attenuates many of the substantial changes in gene expression that are provoked by acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in pigs. Dronedarone modifies the expression of gene panels related to post-infarction cardiac healing and remodeling processes and, most remarkably, this occurs predominantly in the infarction border-zone and much less so in the vital or infarcted myocardium. Combined \"omics\" identified matricellular proteins and ECM as major dronedarone-regulated targets and emphasizes their relevance for Disease Charts and Tox Function Charts associated with tissue remodeling and cellular movement. The results demonstrate dronedarone's capability of regulating cardiac repair and remodeling processes specifically in the infarction border zone and identify underlying mechanisms and pathways that might be employed in future therapeutic strategies to improve long-term cardiac tissue function and stability.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2018-08-15", "authors": ["Ravi KChilukoti", "JosefineLendeckel", "KatrinDarm", "AlicjaBukowska", "AndreasGoette", "MarcS\u00fchling", "KirstenUtpatel", "BarbaraPeters", "GeorgHomuth", "UweV\u00f6lker", "CarmenWolke", "ChristianScharf", "UweLendeckel"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370218788517"}

{"title": "Effects of farnesoid-X-receptor SUMOylation mutation on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice.", "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury induces excessive cellular apoptosis and contributes significantly to final infarct size. We previously demonstrated that a nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a crucial role in mediating myocardial apoptosis. The FXR functions are regulated by post translational modifications (PTM). However, whether the proapoptotic effect of FXR in MI/R injury is regulated by PTM remains unclear. Here, we aimed to study the effect of SUMOylation, a PTM involved in the pathogenesis of MI/R injury per se, on the proapoptotic effect of FXR in MI/R injury. We observed that FXR could be SUMOylated in heart tissues, and FXR SUMOylation levels were downregulated in ischemia reperfused myocardium. By overexpression of SUMOylation-defective FXR mutant, it was demonstrated that decreased SUMOylation augmented the detrimental effect of FXR, via activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and autophagy dysfunction in MI/R injury. Further mechanistic studies suggested that decreased SUMOylation levels increased the transcription activity of FXR, and the subsequently upregulated FXR target gene SHP mediated the proapoptotic effects of FXR. Taken together, we provided the first evidence that the cardiac effects of FXR could be regulated by SUMOylation, and that manipulating FXR SUMOylation levels may hold therapeutic promise for constraining MI/R injury.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2018-08-12", "authors": ["YiGao", "YichaoZhao", "AncaiYuan", "LongweiXu", "XianHuang", "YuanyuanSu", "LingchenGao", "QingqiJi", "JunPu", "BenHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.07.004"}
{"title": "Danhong Injection Enhances the Therapeutic Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Myocardial Infarction by Promoting Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to dramatically transform the treatment and prognosis of myocardial infarction (MI), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a promising cell population to ameliorate the heart remodeling in post-MI. However, poor implantation and survival in ischemic myocardium restrict its efficacy and application. In this study, we sought to use the unique mode of action of Chinese medicine to improve this situation. Surrounding the myocardial infarct area, we performed a multi-point MSC transplantation and administered in conjunction with Danhong injection, which is mainly used for the treatment of MI. Our results showed that the MSC survival rate and cardiac function were improved significantly through the small animal imaging system and echocardiography, respectively. Moreover, histological analysis showed that MSC combined with DHI intervention significantly reduced myocardial infarct size in myocardial infarcted mice and significantly increased MSC resident. To investigate the mechanism of DHI promoting MSC survival and cell migration, PCR and WB experiments were performed. Our results showed that DHI could promote the expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 in MSC and enhance the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 in myocardium, and this effect can be inhibited by AMD3100 (an SDF1/CXCR4 antagonist). Additionally, MSC in combination with DHI interfered with MI in mice and this signifies that when combined, the duo could the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the marginal zone of infarction compared with when either MSC or DHI are used individually. Based on these results, we conclude that DHI enhances the residence of MSCs in cardiac tissue by modulating the SDF1/CXCR4 signaling pathway.

{"title": "Atrial Rotor Dynamics Under Complex Fractional Order Diffusion.", "abstract": "The mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) are a challenging research topic. The rotor hypothesis states that the AF is sustained by a reentrant wave that propagates around an unexcited core. Cardiac tissue heterogeneities, both structural and cellular, play an important role during fibrillatory dynamics, so that the ionic characteristics of the currents, their spatial distribution and their structural heterogeneity determine the meandering of the rotor. Several studies about rotor dynamics implement the standard diffusion equation. However, this mathematical scheme carries some limitations. It assumes the myocardium as a continuous medium, ignoring, therefore, its discrete and heterogeneous aspects. A computational model integrating both, electrical and structural properties could complement experimental and clinical results. A new mathematical model of the action potential propagation, based on complex fractional order derivatives is presented. The complex derivative order appears of considering the myocardium as discrete-scale invariant fractal. The main aim is to study the role of a myocardial, with fractal characteristics, on atrial fibrillatory dynamics.

{"title": "Long-term contractile activity and thyroid hormone supplementation produce engineered rat myocardium with adult-like structure and function.", "abstract": "The field of cardiac tissue engineering has developed rapidly, but structural and functional immaturity of engineered heart tissues hinder their widespread use. Here, we show that a combination of low-rate (0.2\u202fHz) contractile activity and thyroid hormone (T3) supplementation significantly promote structural and functional maturation of engineered rat cardiac tissues (\"cardiobundles\"). The progressive maturation of cardiobundles during first 2\u202fweeks of culture resulted in cell cycle exit and loss of spontaneous activity, which in longer culture yielded decreased contractile function. Maintaining a low level of contractile activity by 0.2\u202fHz pacing between culture weeks 3 and 5, combined with T3 treatment, yielded significant growth of cardiobundle and myocyte cross-sectional areas (by 68% and 32%, respectively), increased nuclei numbers (by 22%), improved twitch force (by 39%), shortened action potential duration (by 32%), polarized N-cadherin distribution, and switch from immature (slow skeletal) to mature (fast) cardiac troponin I isoform expression.

{"title": "Aberrant Protein Turn-Over Associated With Myofibrillar Disorganization in FHL1 Knockout Mice.", "abstract": "Mutations in the FHL1 gene, and FHL1 protein deletion, are associated with rare hereditary myopathies and cardiomyopathies. FHL1-null mice develop age-dependent myopathy and increased autophagic activity. However, the molecular pathway involved in contractile function and increased autophagic activity in the FHL1-null mouse has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, FHL1 protein was knocked out in mice using Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and the IRS1-FOXO1/mTOR signaling pathway was investigated in skeletal muscles and heart. TALEN constructs caused targeted mutations in 30% of newborn mice; these mutations caused a deletion of 1-13 base pairs which blocked synthesis of the full-length FHL1 protein. Furthermore, 2.5-month old FHL1-null male mice were not prone to global muscular fatigue when compared with WT littermates, but histological analysis and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of myofibrillar disorganization and the accumulation of autophagosome or autolysosome-like structures in FHL1-null mice. Moreover, autophagy and mitophagy were both activated in FHL1 KO mice and the degradation of autophagic lysosomes was impeded. Enhanced autophagic activity in FHL1 KO mice was induced by FOXO1 up-regulation and protein synthesis was increased via mTOR. The cytoskeletal proteins, MYBPC2 and LDB3, were involved in the formation of pathological changes in FHL1 KO mice. Markers of early differentiation (MEF2C and MYOD1) and terminal differentiation (total MYH) were both up-regulated in tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in FHL1 KO mice. The number of type I and type II fibers increased in FHL1-null TA muscles, but the number of type| | b, and type | | d fibers were both reduced in FHL1-null TA muscles. The results obtained from the heart were consistent with those from the skeletal muscle and indicated autophagic activation by FOXO1 and an increase in protein synthesis via mTOR also occurred in the heart tissue of FHL1 knockout mice. In conclusion, aberrant protein turn-over associated with myofibrillar disorganization in FHL1 knockout mice. the up-regulation of FOXO1 was associated with enhanced autophagic activity and pathological changes in the muscle fibers of FHL1 KO mice.

At the cellular level, HSPs by acting as molecular chaperone prevents the heat induced aggregation of denatured proteins and play a significant role in adaptation to temperature. Among different HSP family members, Hsp70 is the highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein. The present study is carried out to detect changes in the localization of Hsp70/Hsc70 in gill and heart tissues of control and heat shocked juveniles of Macrobrachium malcolmsonii that could be correlated with the functional significance of these two isoforms. Two groups of prawn acclimated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C were exposed to reported optimum Hsp70 induction temperatures of 36\u00a0\u00b0C and 38\u00a0\u00b0C for heart and gill, respectively, for a duration of 48\u00a0h. These tissues were processed by immunocytochemical methods to detect intra-cellular localization of Hsp70/Hsc70. Western blotting analysis was performed to determine the cytoplasmic or nuclear localization of Hsp70/Hsc70 and band intensity was detected in total lysate, cytosolic and nuclear extracts of gill and heart tissue. The present investigation clearly shows that there are alterations in the intracellular localization of Hsp70/Hsc70 in the cells of the gill and heart tissues of M. malcolmsonii following heat stress.

{"title": "Microfabrication of AngioChip, a biodegradable polymer scaffold with microfluidic vasculature.", "abstract": "Microengineered biomimetic systems for organ-on-a-chip or tissue engineering purposes often fail as a result of an inability to recapitulate the in vivo environment, specifically the presence of a well-defined vascular system. To address this limitation, we developed an alternative method to cultivate three-dimensional (3D) tissues by incorporating a microfabricated scaffold, termed AngioChip, with a built-in perfusable vascular network. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for fabricating the AngioChip scaffold, populating it with endothelial cells and parenchymal tissues, and applying it in organ-on-a-chip drug testing in vitro and surgical vascular anastomosis in vivo. The fabrication of the AngioChip scaffold is achieved by a 3D stamping technique, in which an intricate microchannel network can be embedded within a 3D scaffold. To develop a vascularized tissue, endothelial cells are cultured in the lumen of the AngioChip network, and parenchymal cells are encapsulated in hydrogels that are amenable to remodeling around the vascular network to form functional tissues. Together, these steps yield a functional, vascularized network in vitro over a 14-d period. Finally, we demonstrate the functionality of AngioChip-vascularized hepatic and cardiac tissues, and describe direct surgical anastomosis of the AngioChip vascular network on the hind limb of a Lewis rat model.", "journal": "Nature protocols", "date": "2018-08-04", "authors": ["BoyangZhang", "Benjamin Fook LunLai", "RuoxiaoXie", "LockeDavenport Huyer", "MilesMontgomery", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1038/s41596-018-0015-8"}

We simultaneously induced cardiomyocytes (CMs) and vascular cells [vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular mural cells (MCs)] from hiPSCs. We generated L-CTSs using 10cm-sized temperature-responsive culture dishes. We induced myocardial infarction (MI) in micromini-pigs (15-25 kg) and transplanted the L-CTSs (Tx) 2 weeks after MI induction (4 sheets/recipient) under immunosuppression (Tx: n = 5, Sham: n = 5).

Ischaemic wall behavior under this condition was analyzed through wall thickness and ventricular pressure variations, acquired during an obstructive flow maneuver performed on left coronary arteries of surgically instrumented animals. Basically, the induction of ischaemia depends on the temporary occlusion of left circumflex coronary artery (which supplies blood to the posterior left ventricular wall) that lasts for a few seconds. Normal perfusion of the wall was then reestablished while the anterior ventricular wall remained adequately perfused during the entire maneuver. The obtained results showed that system dynamics could be effectively described by entropy-complexity loops, in both abnormally and well perfused walls.

In the present study, the lncRNA Taurine Upregulated Gene\u00a01\u00a0(TUG1), reported as a regulator of hypoxia fibrosis in the lungs, was found to also be an important regulator of cardiac FMT. Specifically, the possible role of TUG1 in cardiac FMT and fibrosis under chronic hypoxia was investigated. It was revealed that the degree of fibrosis in heart tissues collected from congenital heart surgery patients with low pulse oxygen saturation and mice housed under chronic hypoxic and atmospheric pressure conditions was negatively correlated with pulse oxygen saturation. Moreover, TUG1 expression was positively correlated with the degree of fibrosis but negatively correlated with pulse oxygen saturation. Cardiac fibroblasts showed increased myofibroblast marker, collagen I and \u03b1\u2011SMA expression levels as the hypoxia time increased. TUG1 knockdown ameliorated the hypoxia\u2011induced FMT.

The artery diameter decreased in long-term fixation in every tested solution. For atrial and angle measurements, 4% FPBS caused most significant changes among investigated fixatives.\nIn all tested solutions, long-term fixation significantly changed cardiac tissue dimension compared to the nonpreserved samples.

{"title": "Obesity-mediated regulation of cardiac protein acetylation: parallel analysis of total and acetylated proteins via TMT-tagged mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Lysine residues undergo diverse and reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs). Lysine acetylation has traditionally been studied in the epigenetic regulation of nucleosomal histones that provides an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. Histone acetylation plays a key role in cardiac remodeling and function. However, recent studies have shown that thousands of proteins can be acetylated at multiple acetylation sites, suggesting the acetylome rivals the kinome as a PTM. Based on this, we examined the impact of obesity on protein lysine acetylation in the left ventricle (LV) of male c57BL/6J mice. We reported that obesity significantly increased heart enlargement and fibrosis. Moreover, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that lysine acetylation was markedly altered with obesity and that this phenomenon was cardiac tissue specific. Mass spectral analysis identified 2515 proteins, of which 65 were significantly impacted by obesity. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis\u00ae (IPA) further demonstrated that these proteins were involved in metabolic dysfunction and cardiac remodeling. In addition to total protein, 189 proteins were acetylated, 14 of which were significantly impacted by obesity. IPA identified the Cardiovascular Disease Pathway as significantly regulated by obesity. This network included aconitate hydratase 2 (ACO2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), in which acetylation was significantly increased by obesity. These proteins are known to regulate cardiac function yet, the impact for ACO2 and DLD acetylation remains unclear.

Cats are documented reservoir hosts for Bartonella henselae, the infectious cause of cat scratch disease in man. Various Bartonella spp. have been associated with culture-negative endocarditis, myocarditis and sudden death in man and animals. We hypothesized that Bartonella spp. DNA could be amplified more often from the hearts of cats with feline endomyocarditis-left ventricular endocardial fibrosis (FEMC-LVEF) complex compared with cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or cats with grossly and microscopically unremarkable hearts (designated non-cardiac disease controls). Formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded, cardiac tissues from 60 domestic and purebred cats aged 3 months to 18 years were examined, and histological features were recorded. Cardiac tissue sections were tested for Bartonella DNA using multiple 16-23S intergenic transcribed spacer region polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets, including two Bartonella genera, a Bartonella koehlerae species-specific and a Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii-specific assay, followed by DNA sequence confirmation of the species or genotype. Special precautions were taken to avoid DNA cross-contamination between tissues. Bartonella spp. DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced from 18 of 36 cats (50%) with FEMC-LVEF and 1/12 (8.3%) cats with HCM. Bartonella spp. DNA was not amplified from any non-cardiac disease control hearts. Based on PCR/DNA sequencing, one Bartonella spp. was amplified from 10 cats, while the remaining eight were coinfected with more than one Bartonella spp. To our knowledge, this study represents the first documentation of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotype I infection in cats (n\u00a0=\u00a011). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization testing facilitated visualization of Bartonella bacteria within the myocardium of four of seven PCR-positive FEMC-LVEF hearts. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that Bartonella spp. may play a primary role or act as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of FEMC-LVEF.

{"title": "Tracking morphological complexities of organ development in culture.", "abstract": "Organogenesis is one of the most striking process during development. During this period, organ primordia pass throughout several stages in which the level of organisation increases in complexity to achieve the final organ architecture. Organ culture, a method in which an isolated organ is explanted and maintained ex-vivo, is an excellent tool for following the morphological dynamics during development. While most of the work has been made in early stages of development, culturing organs in mid-late stages is needed to understand the achievement of the final organ anatomy in the new-born. Here, we investigated the possibility of following morphological changes of the mice heart, lung, kidney and intestine using a filter-grid culture method for 7\u202fdays starting at E14.5. We observed that the anatomy, histology and survival of the cultured organs were indicative of a continuity of the developmental processes: they survived and morphodifferentiated during 5-7\u202fdays in culture. The exception was the heart, which started to die after 4\u202fdays. Using a second approach, we demonstrated that heart tissue can be easily cultured in body slices, together with other tissues such as the lung, with a healthier differentiation and longer survival. The culture method used here, permits a high-resolution imaging to identify the dynamic of organ architecture ex-vivo using morphovideos. We also confirmed the suitability of this system to perform lineage tracing using a vital dye in branching organs. In summary, this work tested the feasibility of monitoring and recording the anatomical changes that establish the final organ structure of the heart, lung, kidney and intestine.

{"title": "Combination of anthracyclines and anti-CD47 therapy inhibit invasive breast cancer growth while preventing cardiac toxicity by regulation of autophagy.", "abstract": "A perennial challenge in systemic cytotoxic cancer therapy is to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease while sparing normal tissue from off-target effects of chemotherapy. Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are effective chemotherapeutic agents for which dosing is limited by development of cardiotoxicity. Our published evidence shows that targeting CD47 enhances radiation-induced growth delay of tumors while remarkably protecting soft tissues. The protection of cell viability observed with CD47 is mediated autonomously by activation of protective autophagy. However, whether CD47 protects cancer cells from cytotoxic chemotherapy is unknown.\nWe tested the effect of CD47 blockade on cancer cell survival using a 2-dimensional high-throughput cell proliferation assay in 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. To evaluate blockade of CD47 in combination with chemotherapy in vivo, we employed the 4T1 breast cancer model and examined tumor and cardiac tissue viability as well as autophagic flux.\nOur high-throughput screen revealed that blockade of CD47 does not interfere with the cytotoxic activity of anthracyclines against 4T1 breast cancer cells. Targeting CD47 enhanced the effect of doxorubicin chemotherapy in vivo by reducing tumor growth and metastatic spread by activation of an anti-tumor innate immune response. Moreover, systemic suppression of CD47 protected cardiac tissue viability and function in mice treated with doxorubicin.\nOur experiments indicate that the protective effects observed with CD47 blockade are mediated through upregulation of autophagic flux. However, the absence of CD47 in did not elicit a protective effect in cancer cells,\u00a0but it enhanced macrophage-mediated cancer cell cytolysis. Therefore, the differential responses observed with CD47 blockade are due to autonomous activation of protective autophagy in normal tissue and enhancement immune cytotoxicity against cancer cells.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2018-07-30", "authors": ["Yismeilin RFeliz-Mosquea", "Ashley AChristensen", "Adam SWilson", "BrianWestwood", "JasminaVaragic", "Giselle CMel\u00e9ndez", "Anthony LSchwartz", "Qing-RongChen", "LesleyMathews Griner", "RajarshiGuha", "Craig JThomas", "MarcFerrer", "Maria JMerino", "Katherine LCook", "David DRoberts", "David RSoto-Pantoja"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-018-4884-x"}

The decellularization process was carried out utilizing four consecutive stages including hypotonic treatment, detergent treatment, enzymatic digestion and decontamination, respectively. In order to fabricate the dMEbF, dBM were digested with pepsin and gelation process was conducted. dMEbF were then crosslinked with N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) to increase their durability. Nuclear contents of native BM and decellularized BM (dBM) tissues were determined with DNA content analysis and agarose-gel electrophoresis. Cell viability on dMEbF for 3rd, 7th, and 14th days was assessed by MTT assay. Cell attachment on dMEbF was also studied by scanning electron microscopy. Trans-differentiation capacity of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) into cardiomyocyte-like cells on dMEbF were also evaluated by histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. DNA contents for native and dBM were, respectively, found as 886.11\u2009\u00b1\u2009164.85 and 47.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009ng/mg dry weight, indicating a successful decellularization process. The results of glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline assay, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), performed in order to characterize the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of native and dBM tissue, showed that the BM matrix was not damaged during the proposed method. Lastly, regarding the histological study, dMEbF not only mimics native ECM, but also induces the stem cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells phenotype which brings it the potential of use in CTE.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

{"title": "Temperature-sensitive sarcomeric protein post-translational modifications revealed by top-down proteomics.", "abstract": "Despite advancements in symptom management for heart failure (HF), this devastating clinical syndrome remains the leading cause of death in the developed world. Studies using animal models have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF; however, differences in cardiac physiology and the manifestation of HF between animals, particularly rodents, and humans necessitates the direct interrogation of human heart tissue samples. Nevertheless, an ever-present concern when examining human heart tissue samples is the potential for artefactual changes related to temperature changes during tissue shipment or sample processing. Herein, we examined the effects of temperature on the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of sarcomeric proteins, the proteins responsible for muscle contraction, under conditions mimicking those that might occur during tissue shipment or sample processing. Using a powerful top-down proteomics method, we found that sarcomeric protein PTMs were differentially affected by temperature. Specifically, cardiac troponin I and enigma homolog isoform 2 showed robust increases in phosphorylation when tissue was incubated at either 4\u202f\u00b0C or 22\u202f\u00b0C. The observed increase is likely due to increased cyclic AMP levels and activation of protein kinase A in the tissue. On the contrary, cardiac troponin T and myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation decreased when tissue was incubated at 4\u202f\u00b0C or 22\u202f\u00b0C. Furthermore, significant protein degradation was also observed after incubation at 4\u202f\u00b0C or 22\u202f\u00b0C. Overall, these results indicate that temperature exerts various effects on sarcomeric protein PTMs and careful tissue handling is critical for studies involving human heart samples.

This study evaluated the antioxidant and organoprotective effects of SP against diazinon (DZN)-induced subacute toxicity on the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys of male Wistar albino rats. Diazinon (20\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneous) was administered to animals either alone or along with an oral pure SP powder at doses of 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg. Alterations in hematological and serum biochemical parameters, as well as oxidative stress markers in the hepatic, renal, and cardiac tissues were evaluated, using colorimetric spectrophotometric techniques. The obtained results revealed that in comparison to the control group, DZN-treated rats exhibited significantly lower (p\u2009<\u20090.05) red blood cells and platelets counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, and activities of serum acetylcholinesterase and tissue antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase).

{"title": "Crosstalk between the TGF-\u03b2 and WNT signalling pathways during cardiac fibrogenesis.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is referred to as an excessive accumulation of stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins in the myocardium. Progressive fibrosis causes stiffening of the cardiac tissue and affects conduction of electrical impulses, leading to heart failures in a broad range of cardiac conditions. At the cellular level, activation of the cardiac stromal cells and myofibroblast formation are considered as hallmarks of fibrogenesis. At the molecular level, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is traditionally considered as a master regulator of the profibrotic processes. More recently, the WNT signalling pathway has also been found to be implicated in the development of myocardial fibrosis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the involvement of TGF-\u03b2 and WNT downstream molecular pathways to cardiac fibrogenesis and describe a crosstalk between these two profibrotic pathways. TGF-\u03b2 and WNT ligands bind to different receptors and trigger various outputs. However, a growing body of evidence points to cross-regulation between these two pathways. It has been recognized that in cardiac pathologies TGF-\u03b2 activates WNT/\u03b2-catenin signalling, which in turn stabilizes the TGF-\u03b2/Smad response. Furthermore both, the non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 and non-canonical WNT signalling pathways, activate the same mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38. The crosstalk between TGF-\u03b2 and WNT pathways seems to play an essential role in switching on the genetic machinery initiating profibrotic changes in the heart. Better understanding of these mechanisms will open new opportunities for development of targeted therapeutic approaches against cardiac fibrosis in the future.", "journal": "Acta biochimica Polonica", "date": "2018-07-25", "authors": ["EdytaDzia\u0142o", "KarolinaTkacz", "Przemys\u0142awB\u0142yszczuk"], "doi": "10.18388/abp.2018_2635"}

Although this metal exhibits broad environmental distribution, its cardiac repercussions are poorly understood, making it difficult to establish diagnostic criteria in cases of Al intoxication. In the absence of clinical data, we used a preclinical model to investigate the impact of Al exposure on heart bioaccumulation, molecular oxidation, micromineral distribution, structural and ultrastructural remodeling of the cardiac tissue. Male Wistar rats were equally randomized into five groups: G1\u202f=\u202fdistilled water; and G2 to G5\u202f=\u202f0.02, 0.1, 50, and 200\u202fmg/kg aluminum solution, respectively. After 120 days, the hearts were collected and subjected to mineral microanalysis, immunoenzymatic detection of 8-OHdG, as well as bright field, polarizing, scanning and transmission electron microscopy to estimate the extent of the cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocytes ultrastructure. Long-term Al exposure induced dose-dependent bioaccumulation, micromineral imbalance, genomic DNA oxidation, structural and ultrastructural abnormalities of the cardiac tissue, resulting in extensive parenchymal loss, stromal expansion, diffuse inflammatory infiltrate, increased glycoconjugate and collagen deposition, subversion and collapse of the collagen network, reduced myocardial vascularization index, mitochondrial swelling, sarcomere disorganization, myofilament dissociation, and fragmentation in cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicated that the heart was sensitive to Al-mediated toxicity, especially in animals treated with the three highest doses of Al. In response to Al-induced loss of the parenchyma, heart stroma exhibited a reactive and compensatory expansion, which, in combination with the increased distribution of thick myofibrils and degenerated mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, provides morphological evidence that cardiac tissue adaptations are not enough to adjust the relationships between the parenchyma and stroma until a steady state is reached, resulting in continuous pathological remodeling potentially associated with Al-induced proinflammatory and pro-oxidant events.", "journal": "Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)", "date": "2018-07-23", "authors": ["R\u00f4mulo DNovaes", "Viviane G SMouro", "Reggiani VGon\u00e7alves", "Andrea A SMendon\u00e7a", "Elizi\u00e1ria CSantos", "Maria C QFialho", "MarianaMachado-Neves"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.034"}

Here, we induce wound formation in an in\u00a0vitro system as a model for these fibrotic conditions: we assessed the dynamics of wound healing in co-cultures of fibroblasts and myocytes upon targeted wound initiation using Electric Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) under optical control. We discovered distinct wound closure dynamics for mono- and co-cultures of myocytes and fibroblasts and observed a cessation of the contractile behavior for recovering cardiomyocyte cultures. We furthermore identified a change of cellular impedance for recovering fibroblasts and the presence of \u03b1-SMA, suggesting a partial transformation into myofibroblasts. This was concomitant with a modulation of connectivity, cell-substrate dynamics and membrane capacitance of all wounded cell cultures.

{"title": "Toxoplasma gondii Lineages Circulating in Slaughtered Industrial Pigs and Potential Risk for Consumers.", "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a cosmopolitan zoonotic protozoan parasite, and the consumption of raw or undercooked pig meat is one of the most important sources of T. gondii infection. Three predominant lineages, types I, II, and III, are widespread in Europe. Although still poorly understood, a relationship between each type and the severity of illness represents a public health issue. To gain further knowledge of the genotypes in circulation and of the potential risk for consumers, one heart sample and one diaphragm sample (206 total) were taken from each of 103 pig carcasses at an abattoir in Italy. Then, we used 529-bp repetitive element PCR and a B1 real-time PCR high-resolution melting assay coupled with sequencing to detect and genotype T. gondii isolates. T. gondii DNA was detected in 14 pigs (13.6%, 95% confidence interval = 7 to 20.2%), and types I (3.9%), II (5.8%), and III (3.9%) were identified. We found that heart tissue had a significantly higher PCR positivity rate for T. gondii than did diaphragm tissue. This is Europe's largest study on genotyping of T. gondii from pigs, and it demonstrates that all three main lineages are present in carcasses of industrially reared pigs in Italy. There is a potential risk to consumers of infection with any or all of the three lineages, and the related clinical consequences should be taken into account. This study suggests that monitoring of T. gondii types in meat is essential, especially in meat that is traditionally eaten raw or that is minimally processed.", "journal": "Journal of food protection", "date": "2018-07-19", "authors": ["AlbertoVergara", "MariannaMarangi", "TizianaCaradonna", "LucaPennisi", "DomenicoPaludi", "RobertoPapini", "AdrianaIanieri", "AnnunziataGiangaspero", "GiovanniNormanno"], "doi": "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-496"}

As each approach has been shown to have its advantages and disadvantages, exploiting the advantages while minimizing the disadvantages has been a challenge. Using human germline pluripotent stem cells (hgPSCs) along with a modified version of a relatively novel cell-expansion culture methodology to induce quick, indefinite expansion of normally slow growing hgPSCs, it was possible to emphasize the advantages of all three approaches. We consistently found that unipotent germline stem cells, when removed from their niche and cultured in the correct medium, expressed endogenously, pluripotency genes, which induced them to become hgPSCs. These cells are then capable of producing cell types from all three germ layers. Upon differentiation into cardiac lineages, our data consistently showed that they not only expressed cardiac genes, but also expressed cardiac-promoting paracrine factors. Taking these data a step further, we found that hgPSC-derived cardiac cells could integrate into cardiac tissue ", "journal": "Journal of stem cells & regenerative medicine", "date": "2018-07-19", "authors": ["SamikshaMahapatra", "DiannaMartin", "G IanGallicano"], "doi": "10.46582/jsrm.1401003"}

The vagal nerve was stimulated with regular pulses of 0.2ms duration at 20 Hz for 10 seconds every minute for 4 hours, and then ACh levels by ELISA in cardiac tissue and serum were evaluated for its release after VNS. Three and 14 days after VNS, Real-time PCR, immunostaining and western blot were respectively used to determine VEGF-A/B expressions and \u03b1-SMA- and CD31-postive vessels in VNS-hearts with pretreatment of \u03b17-nAChR blocker mecamylamine (10 mg/kg, ip) or mACh-R blocker atropine (10 mg/kg, ip) for 1 hour. The coronary function and left ventricular performance were analyzed by Langendorff system and hemodynamic parameters in VNS-hearts with pretreatment of VEGF-A/B-knockdown or VEGFR blocker AMG706. Coronary arterial endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tube formation were evaluated for angiogenesis following the stimulation of VNS in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).\nVNS has been shown to stimulate VEGF-A and VEGF-B expressions in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) with an increase of \u03b1-SMA- and CD31-postive vessel number in infarcted hearts. The VNS-induced VEGF-A/B expressions and angiogenesis were abolished by m-AChR inhibitor atropine and \u03b17-nAChR blocker mecamylamine in vivo. Interestingly, knockdown of VEGF-A by shRNA mainly reduced VNS-mediated formation of CD31+ microvessels. In contrast, knockdown of VEGF-B powerfully abrogated VNS-induced formation of \u03b1-SMA+ vessels. Consistently, VNS-induced VEGF-A showed a greater effect on EC tube formation as compared to VNS-induced VEGF-B. Moreover, VEGF-A promoted EC proliferation and VSMC migration while VEGF-B induced VSMC proliferation and EC migration in vitro. Mechanistically, vagal neurotransmitter acetylcholine stimulated VEGF-A/B expressions through m/nACh-R/PI3K/Akt/Sp1 pathway in EC. Functionally, VNS improved the coronary function and left ventricular performance.

A major cause of MI is fibrin-rich thrombus formation that occludes the coronary arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing fibrin deposition. In treating MI, re-establishing blood flow is critical. However, ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury itself can also occur and contributes to cardiac fibrosis. Fibrin-specific poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels (FSNs) comprised of a core-shell colloidal hydrogel architecture are utilized in this study to design a dual-delivery system that simultaneously addresses the need to (1) re-establish blood flow and (2) inhibit cardiac fibrosis following I/R injury. These therapeutic needs are met by controlling the release of a fibrinolytic protein, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and a small molecule cell contractility inhibitor (Y-27632). In vitro, tPA and Y-27632-loaded FSNs rapidly degrade fibrin and decrease cardiac cell stress fiber formation and connective tissue growth factor expression, which are both upregulated in cardiac fibrosis. In vivo, FSNs localize to fibrin in injured heart tissue and, when loaded with tPA and Y-27632, showed significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction 2 and 4 weeks post-I/R as well as significantly decreased infarct size, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression, and connective tissue growth factor expression 4 weeks post-I/R.

They have been usually treated using drugs, but catheter ablation has proven more effective. This is an invasive method devised to destroy the heart tissue that disturbs correct heart rhythm. In order to accurately localise the focus of this disturbance, the acquisition and processing of atrial electrograms form the usual mapping technique. They can be single potentials, double potentials, or complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) potentials, and last ones are the most effective targets for ablation. The electrophysiological substrate is then localised by a suitable signal processing method. Sample Entropy is a statistic scarcely applied to electrograms but can arguably become a powerful tool to analyse these time series, supported by its results in other similar biomedical applications. However, the lack of an analysis of its dependence on the perturbations usually found in electrogram data, such as missing samples or spikes, is even more marked. This paper applied SampEn to the segmentation between non-CFAE and CFAE records and assessed its class segmentation power loss at different levels of these perturbations. The results confirmed that SampEn was able to significantly distinguish between non-CFAE and CFAE records, even under very unfavourable conditions, such as 50% of missing data or 10% of spikes.", "journal": "Computational and mathematical methods in medicine", "date": "2018-07-17", "authors": ["Eva Mar\u00edaCirugeda-Rold\u00e1n", "AntonioMolina Pic\u00f3", "DanielNov\u00e1k", "DavidCuesta-Frau", "VaclavKremen"], "doi": "10.1155/2018/1874651\n10.5772/60700\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw260\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2009.11.002\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.00832.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.05.011\n10.1088/0967-3334/29/12/002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.12.054\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.04.021\n10.1007/s11517-016-1456-2\n10.1016/j.artmed.2011.06.007\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.05.028\n10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280407\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2028015\n10.1109/COASE.2006.326875\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.10.014\n10.1155/2015/272954\n10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091509\n10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346901\n10.1152/ajpregu.00069.2002\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.11.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.6.H2039\n10.3390/e17117493\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01189.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.4.1665\n10.1214/09-SS051\n10.1080/03610920601036481\n10.1007/BF01619355\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2008.09.001\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.02.009\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.068102"}
{"title": "A male with multiple cardiac masses.", "abstract": "SummaryThirty-seven-year-old male presented with cough, dyspnea, significant weight loss (20 kg) and subacute fever for the past 2 months. Physical examination revealed inspiratory and expiratory wheezing bilaterally. A normal S1, S2 and a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper parasternal border with respiratory variation were found during cardiac auscultation. Kidney and bone marrow biopsy reported a high-grade B-cell lymphoma. Echocardiography and cardiac CT findings consisted of multiple intracardiac masses affecting the right ventricular (RV) outflow track, RV apex, medial portion of the right atrium and posterior left atrium, as well as mild impairment of the RV systolic function. The masses in the RV outflow track caused partial obstruction (pulmonary valve peak velocity 2.3\u2009m/s) with a RV systolic pressure of 43\u2009mmHg. The infiltrative mass in the interatrial septum extended into both the right and left atrial cavities. The right superior pulmonary vein was occluded. This patient was treated with aggressive chemotherapy and had a good clinical response that resulted in mass size reduction after the first course of chemotherapy. Multimodality imaging techniques such as echocardiography, cardiac CT and PET scan can provide complementary information to better evaluate, stage and manage these patients.\nLymphoma can be found as a primary tumor in cardiac tissue, but secondary cardiac lymphoma is far more common.Appropriate investigation, histopathology, immunophenotype, staging and risk assessment are required for definite diagnosis and treatment.Cardiac lymphoma frequently manifests as an ill-defined, infiltrative mass. Typical location is in the atrium (right atrium is the most common site). Pericardial thickening or effusion is also common.Echocardiography is a quick, bedside, non-invasive assessment of anatomical involvement and hemodynamics affected by cardiac lymphoma. Echocardiographic findings of cardiac lymphoma include a hypoechoic, ill-defined infiltrative masses in the myocardium, nodular protrusion into cardiac chambers and pericardial effusion. Obstruction of inflow/outflow track can also be found.If a diagnosis of cardiac lymphoma is made, the most effective treatment is chemotherapy.

{"title": "Sevoflurane postconditioning protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by restoring autophagic flux via an NO-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "Volatile anesthetics improve postischemic cardiac function and reduce infarction even when administered for only a brief time at the onset of reperfusion. A recent study showed that sevoflurane postconditioning (SPC) attenuated myocardial reperfusion injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of sevoflurane on nitric oxide (NO) release and autophagic flux during the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats in vivo and ex vivo. Male rats were subjected to 30\u2009min ischemia and 2\u2009h reperfusion in the presence or absence of sevoflurane (1.0 minimum alveolar concentration) during the first 15\u2009min of reperfusion. We found that SPC significantly improved hemodynamic performance after reperfusion, alleviated postischemic myocardial infarction, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content loss, and cytochrome c release in heart tissues. Furthermore, SPC significantly increased the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and elevated myocardial NOS activity and NO production. All these effects were abolished by treatment with an NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10\u2009mg/kg, i.v.). We also observed myocardial I/R-induced accumulation of autophagosomes in heart tissues, as evidenced by increased ratios of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II/I, up-regulation of Beclin 1 and P62, and reduced lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 expression. SPC significantly attenuated I/R-impaired autophagic flux, which were blocked by L-NAME. Moreover, pretreatment with the autophagic flux blocker chloroquine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) increased autophagosome accumulation in SPC-treated heart following I/R and blocked SPC-induced cardioprotection. The same results were also observed in a rat model of myocardial I/R injury ex vivo, suggesting that SPC protects rat hearts against myocardial reperfusion injury by restoring I/R-impaired autophagic flux via an NO-dependent mechanism.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2018-07-14", "authors": ["Shi-GangQiao", "YingSun", "BoSun", "AnWang", "JiaQiu", "LeiHong", "Jian-ZhongAn", "ChenWang", "Hui-LingZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-018-0066-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.01064.2002\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2366\n10.1042/CS20100435\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.11.006\n10.3892/mmr.2015.3533\n10.3390/ijms18030614\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002416\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134666\n10.1089/ars.2010.3488\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.041814\n10.1038/aps.2014.20\n10.1038/cddis.2016.108\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000807\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c4a607\n10.1111/iej.12616\n10.1111/liv.13476\n10.1038/aps.2014.78\n10.1007/s00540-012-1494-3\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001350\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000175238.18702.40\n10.1155/2016/3453059\n10.1038/aps.2012.27\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.094\n10.1007/s00018-004-4125-9\n10.1186/s13578-016-0089-3\n10.1021/bi00221a023\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2201\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.11.003\n10.1074/jbc.M006825200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261924.76669.36\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.017\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.008\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005183\n10.1093/rheumatology/ket471\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.06.005"}

{"title": "Killing Many Birds With Two Stones: Hypoxia and Fibrosis Can Generate Ectopic Beats in a Human Ventricular Model.", "abstract": "During cardiac diseases many types of anatomical and functional remodeling of cardiac tissue can occur. In this work, we focus on two conditions: hypoxia and fibrosis, which are part of complex pathological modifications that take place in many cardiac diseases (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and recurrent myocardial infarction) and respiratory diseases (obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cystic fibrosis). Using computational models of cardiac electrophysiology, we evaluate if the interplay between hypoxia and fibrosis is sufficient to trigger cardiac arrhythmia. We study the mechanisms behind the generation of ectopic beats, an arrhythmic trigger also known as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), in regions with high hypoxia and fibrosis. First, we modify an electrophysiological model of myocytes of the human left ventricle to include the effects of hypoxia. Second, diffuse fibrosis is modeled by randomly replacing cardiac myocytes by non-excitable and non-conducting cells. The Monte Carlo method is used to evaluate the probability of a region to generate ectopic beats with respect to different levels of hypoxia and fibrosis.

By integrating experimental data from key components of cardiac electrophysiology, systems biology simulations can complement empirical findings, provide quantitative insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of action, and guide new hypotheses to better understand this complex biological system to develop novel cardiotherapeutic approaches. In this chapter, we briefly introduce in silico methods to describe the dynamics of physiological and pathophysiological single-cell and tissue-level cardiac electrophysiology. Using a \"bottom-up\" approach, we first describe the basis of ion channel mathematical models.

By applying these fundamentals, we describe how action potentials propagate in models of cardiac tissue. In addition, we provide case studies simulating single-cell and tissue-level arrhythmogenesis, as well as promising approaches to circumvent or overcome such adverse events.

{"title": "In Vivo Nanovector Delivery of a Heart-specific MicroRNA-sponge.", "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) is small non-coding RNA which inhibits post-transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Human diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, have been shown to activate tissue and/or cell-specific miRNA expression associated with disease progression. The inhibition of miRNA expression offers the potential for a therapeutic intervention. However, traditional approaches to inhibit miRNAs, employing antagomir oligonucleotides, affect specific miRNA functions upon global delivery. Herein, we present a protocol for the in vivo cardio-specific inhibition of the miR-181 family in a rat model. A miRNA-sponge construct is designed to include 10 repeated anti-miR-181 binding sequences. The cardio-specific \u03b1-MHC promoter is cloned into the pEGFP backbone to drive the cardio-specific miR-181 miRNA-sponge expression. To create a stable cell line expressing the miR-181-sponge, myoblast H9c2 cells are transfected with the \u03b1-MHC-EGFP-miR-181-sponge construct and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs) into GFP positive H9c2 cells which are cultured with neomycin (G418). Following stable growth in neomycin, monoclonal cell populations are established by additional FACs and single cell cloning. The resulting myoblast H9c2-miR-181-sponge-GFP cells exhibit a loss of function of miR-181 family members as assessed through the increased expression of miR-181 target proteins and compared to H9c2 cells expressing a scramble non-functional sponge. In addition, we develop a nanovector for the systemic delivery of the miR-181-sponge construct by complexing positively charged liposomal nanoparticles and negatively charged miR-181-sponge plasmids. In vivo imaging of GFP reveals that multiple tail vein injections of a nanovector over a three-week period are able to promote a significant expression of the miR-181-sponge in a cardio-specific manner. Importantly, a loss of miR-181 function is observed in the heart tissue but not in the kidney or the liver. The miRNA-sponge is a powerful method to inhibit tissue-specific miRNA expression. Driving the miRNA-sponge expression from a tissue-specific promoter provides specificity for the miRNA inhibition, which can be confined to a targeted organ or tissue. Furthermore, combining nanovector and miRNA-sponge technologies permits an effective delivery and tissue-specific miRNA inhibition in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2018-07-10", "authors": ["Oliver AKent", "CharlesSteenbergen", "SamarjitDas"], "doi": "10.3791/57845"}
{"title": "Neonatal Murine Engineered Cardiac Tissue Toxicology Model: Impact of Metallothionein Overexpression on Cadmium-Induced Injury.", "abstract": "Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) serve as robust in vitro models to study human cardiac diseases including cardiac toxicity assays due to rapid structural and functional maturation and the ability to vary ECT composition. Metallothionein (MT) has been shown to be cardioprotective for environmental toxicants including heavy metals. To date, studies on the role of cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific MT expression and function have occurred in dissociated single cell assays or expensive in vivo small animal models. Therefore, we generated 3D ECTs using neonatal mouse ventricular cells from wild-type (WT) and the CM-specific overexpressing MT-transgenic (MT-TG) to determine the effect of MT overexpression on ECT maturation and function. Because Cadmium (Cd) is an environmentally prevalent heavy metal toxicant with direct negative impact on cardiac structure and function, we then determined the effect of MT overexpression to reduce Cd mediated CM toxicity within ECTs. We found: (1) structural and functional maturation was similar in WT and MT-TG ECTs; (2) Cd exposure negatively impacted ECT cell survival, maturation, and function; and (3) MT-ECTs showed reduced Cd toxicity as defined by reduced cleaved caspase 3, reduced Bax/Bcl2 ratio, reduced TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells, reduced CM loss after Cd treatment, and delayed onset of cardiac dysfunction after Cd treatment. Thus, neonatal murine ECTs can serve as a robust in vitro model for heavy metal toxicity screening and as a platform to evaluate the role cardioprotective mechanisms, such as the MT-TG model, on environmentally relevant toxicants.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2018-07-10", "authors": ["HaitaoYu", "FeiYe", "FangpingYuan", "LuCai", "HongleiJi", "Bradley BKeller"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfy177"}

Among injectable scaffolds, microparticles have been poorly investigated. The goal of this study was the development of novel gelatin/gellan microparticles that could be used as an injectable scaffold to repair the infarcted myocardium. In particular, the effect of particle size on cardiac progenitor cell response was investigated.\nParticles were produced by a water-in-oil emulsion method. Phosphatidylcholine was used as a surfactant. Particles with different diameter ranges (125-300 \u00b5m and 350-450 \u00b5m) were fabricated using two different surfactant concentrations. Morphological, physicochemical, and functional characterizations were carried out. Cardiac progenitor cell adhesion and growth on microparticles were tested both in static and dynamic suspension culture conditions.\nMorphological analysis of the produced particles showed a spherical shape and porous surface. The hydrophilicity of particle matrix and the presence of intermolecular interactions between gellan and gelatin were pointed out by the physicochemical characterization. A weight loss of 75 \u00b1 5 % after 90 days of hydrolytic degradation was observed. Injectability through a narrow needle (26 G) and persistence of the microparticles at the injection site were preliminarily verified by ex vivo test. In vitro cell culture tests showed a preservation of rat cardiac progenitor biologic properties and indicated a preferential cell adherence to microparticles with a smaller size.\nOverall, the obtained results indicate that the produced gelatin/gellan microparticles could be potentially employed as injectable scaffolds for myocardial regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials", "date": "2018-07-06", "authors": ["ElisabettaRosellini", "NiccolettaBarbani", "CaterinaFrati", "DeniseMadeddu", "DianaMassai", "UmbertoMorbiducci", "LuigiLazzeri", "AngelaFalco", "CostanzaLagrasta", "AlbertoAudenino", "Maria GraziaCascone", "FedericoQuaini"], "doi": "10.1177/2280800018782844"}

This study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on cardiac function, tumor growth, mitochondrial fission and fusion, PGC1-\u03b1 and sirtuin activity in an acute model of DXR-induced cardiotoxicity. During the in vitro study, H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were pre-treated with melatonin (10\u202f\u03bcM, 24\u202fh) followed by DXR exposure (3\u202f\u03bcM, 24\u202fh).

{"title": "Mst1 promotes cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting the ERK-CREB pathway and repressing FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy.", "abstract": "Cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury results mainly from mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte death. Mitophagy sustains mitochondrial function and exerts a pro-survival effect on the reperfused heart tissue. Mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) regulates chronic cardiac metabolic damage and autophagic activity, but its role in acute cardiac I/R injury, especially its effect on mitophagy, is unknown. The aim of this study is to explore whether Mst1 is involved in reperfusion-mediated cardiomyocyte death via modulation of FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1)-related mitophagy. Our data indicated that Mst1 was markedly increased in reperfused hearts. However, genetic ablation of Mst1 in Mst1-knockout (Mst1-KO) mice significantly reduced the expansion of the cardiac infarction area, maintained myocardial function and abolished I/R-mediated cardiomyocyte death. At the molecular level, upregulation of Mst1 promoted ROS production, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, facilitated the leakage of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the nucleus, and activated the caspase-9-related apoptotic pathway in reperfused cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, Mst1 activation repressed FUNDC1 expression and consequently inhibited mitophagy. However, deletion of Mst1 was able to reverse FUNDC1 expression and thus re-activate protective mitophagy, effectively sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis and blocking mitochondrial apoptosis in reperfused cardiomyocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that Mst1 regulated FUNDC1 expression via the MAPK/ERK-CREB pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK-CREB pathway prevented FUNDC1 activation caused by Mst1 deletion. Altogether, our data confirm that Mst1 deficiency sends a pro-survival signal for the reperfused heart by reversing FUNDC1-related mitophagy and thus reducing cardiomyocyte mitochondrial apoptosis, which identifies Mst1 as a novel regulator for cardiac reperfusion injury via modulation of mitochondrial homeostasis.", "journal": "The journal of physiological sciences : JPS", "date": "2018-07-02", "authors": ["WanchengYu", "MeiXu", "TaoZhang", "QianZhang", "ChengweiZou"], "doi": "10.1007/s12576-018-0627-3\n10.1111/jpi.12471\n10.1007/s00395-017-0607-4\n10.1116/1.4953246\n10.1007/s00395-017-0600-y\n10.1111/jpi.12419\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.004\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.03.035\n10.1007/s12192-017-0827-4\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.012\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.017\n10.1038/s41418-018-0086-7\n10.1007/s00395-018-0682-1\n10.7554/eLife.21407\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.07.007\n10.1007/s10456-018-9611-z\n10.1111/jpi.12438\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.07.004\n10.1080/15548627.2017.1300224\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.01.020\n10.1007/s00395-017-0657-7\n10.1007/s10456-016-9535-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.010\n10.1007/s10456-016-9528-3\n10.1111/jpi.12503\n10.1007/s00395-017-0609-2\n10.1007/s00395-017-0601-x\n10.1007/s10456-017-9542-0\n10.1111/jpi.12414\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.05.007\n10.1159/000477886\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.001\n10.1111/jpi.12404\n10.1007/s10456-016-9538-1\n10.1038/cdd.2016.119\n10.1111/jpi.12380\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.022\n10.1007/s00395-017-0604-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.02.019\n10.1038/cdd.2016.159\n10.1007/s00395-016-0596-8\n10.1007/s10456-017-9540-2\n10.1007/s12576-016-0473-0\n10.1007/s10456-017-9554-9\n10.1186/s11658-018-0085-1\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.03.012\n10.1007/s12576-017-0549-5\n10.1007/s00395-017-0621-6\n10.1007/s10456-016-9525-6\n10.1111/jpi.12372\n10.1111/jpi.12450\n10.1007/s10456-016-9531-8\n10.1007/s12576-016-0493-9\n10.1007/s00395-017-0626-1\n10.1159/000487450\n10.1186/s11658-018-0081-5\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.08.013\n10.1007/s12576-016-0492-x"}

In this project, we further optimized the organotypic culture condition to maintain normal electrophysiology of the human cardiac slices for 4 days. The prolonged culture of human cardiac tissue slices demonstrated here enables the study of chronic drug effects, gene therapies, and gene editing. To achieve greater control of the culture environment, we have also developed an automated, self-contained heart-on-a-chip system. The culture system supports media circulation, oxygenation, temperature control, electrical stimulation, and static mechanical loading. The culture parameters can be individually adjusted to establish the optimal culture condition to achieve long-term culture and to minimize tissue dedifferentiation.

{"title": "Captopril inhibits calpain\u2011mediated apoptosis of myocardial cells in diabetic rats and improves cardiac function.", "abstract": "To explore the effects of captopril on calpain\u2011mediated apoptosis of myocardial cells and cardiac function in diabetic rats, 30 adult male Sprague\u2011Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: Negative control (NC group), untreated diabetic rats (DM group) and diabetic rats treated with captopril (Cap group). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection. Captopril was intragastrically administered at a daily dose of 50\u00a0mg/kg for 12\u00a0weeks; the NC and DM groups received an equivalent volume of saline. After 12\u00a0weeks of treatment, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end\u2011diastolic pressure (LVDEP), maximal rate of left ventricular pressure increase (+dp/dtmax), maximal rate of left ventricular pressure decrease (\u2011dp/dtmax) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were measured. The levels of calpain\u20111, calpain\u20112, B\u2011cell lymphoma (Bcl)\u20112, Bcl\u20112 associated protein X (Bax) and total caspase\u20113 were detected in cardiac tissue by western blot analysis. The apoptotic index (AI) was assessed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2011mediated dUTP nick\u2011end labeling assay. The ultrastructure of cardiac tissue was determined by transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the NC group, LVDEP and LVMI were increased, whereas LVSP, +dp/dtmax and \u2011dp/dtmax were decreased in the DM group. In the Cap group, LVDEP and LVMI were decreased, whereas LVSP, +dp/dtmax and \u2011dp/dtmax were increased compared with the DM group. Bcl\u20112 protein expression was decreased, whereas the levels of calpain\u20111, calpain\u20112, Bax and total caspase\u20113 protein were increased in the DM group, compared with the NC group. Cap treatment increased Bcl\u20112 protein expression and decreased calpain\u20111, calpain\u20112, Bax and total caspase\u20113 protein expression compared with the DM group. Additionally, the AI was increased in the DM group compared with the NC group, and decreased in the Cap group compared with the DM group. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that myocardial cell injury was reduced in the Cap group compared with the DM group. Therefore, captopril improved myocardial structure and ventricular function, by inhibiting calpain\u20111 and calpain\u20112 activation, increasing Bcl\u20112 expression, reducing Bax expression and subsequently inhibiting caspase\u20113\u2011dependent apoptosis.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2018-06-30", "authors": ["Li-YaDong", "Li-PingYao", "JingZhao", "Ke-KeJin", "Xiao-XiaoQiu"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2018.9192"}

It has been found that the expression of inflammatory cytokine S100A8/A9 was elevated in acute MI patients, whereas its impact in CR after infarction remains unclear.\nSamples from cardiac tissue and peripheral blood of patients with CR after MI, MI, patients without CR, and healthy control (cardiotrauma) were collected to test the expressions of S100A8/A9, p-p65, and MMP-9.

Hypoxia-ischemia significantly caused the increasing levels of S100A8/A9 and TNF\u03b1 in macrophages (p < 0.05). The blockade of S100A9 and/or TNF\u03b1 suppressed the activation and migration of macrophages. The inhibition of S100A9 expression also decreased the secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages, while the suppression of TNF\u03b1 showed no significant impact on S100A8 and S100A9 levels. Downregulation of TNF\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB markedly declined p-p65 and MMP-9 protein levels in HCF cells from co-culture system or single culture, whereas the blockade of S100A9 only reduced their expressions in co-cultured HCF cells.\nThe level of S100A8/A9 was upregulated in MI patients with CR.

Interventional reperfusion induces further damage to the ischemic myocardium through neutrophil infiltration and acute inflammation. As caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) plays a critical role in innate immune response and inflammation, we hypothesized that CARD9 knockout would provide protection against ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury through attenuation of acute inflammatory responses. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and CARD9-/- mice were subjected to 45 min left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion followed by 24-h reperfusion. Area at risk (AAR) and infarct size were measured by Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Frozen heart sections were stained with anti-mouse GR-1 antibody to detect infiltrated neutrophils. Concentrations of cytokines/chemokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CXCL-1 and MCP-1 were determined in heart tissue homogenate and serum by ELISA assay. Western immunoblotting analyses were performed to measure the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Our results indicate that following I/R, infarct size was significantly smaller in CARD9-/- mice compared to WT. The number of infiltrated neutrophils was significantly lower in CARD9-/- mice compared to WT.

{"title": "A heart for fibrillin: spatial arrangement in adult wild-type murine myocardial tissue.", "abstract": "Fibrillins are major constituents of microfibrils, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues where they contribute to the tissue homeostasis. Although it is known that microfibrils are abundantly expressed in the left ventricle of the heart, limited data are available about the presence of microfibrils in the other parts of the myocardial tissue and whether there are age or sex-related differences in the spatial arrangement of the microfibrils. This basic knowledge is essential to better understand the impact of fibrillin-1 pathogenic variants on the myocardial tissue as seen in Marfan related cardiomyopathy. We performed histological analyses on wild-type male and female murine myocardial tissue collected at different time-points (1, 3 and 6 months). Fibrillin-1 and -2 immunofluorescence stainings were performed on cross-sections at the level of the apex, the mid-ventricles and the atria. In addition, other myocardial matrix components such as collagen and elastin were also investigated. Fibrillin-1 presented as long fibres in the apex, mid-ventricles and atria. The spatial arrangement differed between the investigated regions, but not between age groups or sexes. Collagen had a similar broad spatial arrangement to that of fibrillin-1, whereas elastic fibres were primarily present in the atria and the vessels. In contrast to fibrillin-1, limited amounts of fibrillin-2 were observed. Fibrillin-rich fibres contribute to the architecture of the myocardial tissue in a region-dependent manner in wild-type murine hearts.

Despite the attractive advantages of SVFs in clinical interventions, the recent status of clinical studies involving the application of SVFs in many diseases has not been fully evaluated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types despite their low numbers in heart tissue. Here, we sought to determine if SVF implantation into impaired heart tissue affected endogenous MSCs in the heart. Therefore, we investigated the expression levels of proteins associated with oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in MSCs co-cultured with adipose-derived adherent stromal cells (ADASs) from 6 donors' SVFs under oxidative stress conditions for their roles in many physiological processes in the heart.

{"title": "Unlockable Nanocomplexes with Self-Accelerating Nucleic Acid Release for Effective Staged Gene Therapy of Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "Nucleic acid (NA)-based therapy is proposed to address serious diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Powerful NA delivery vehicles are essential for effective gene therapy. Herein, a novel type of delivery vehicle, an unlockable core-shell nanocomplex (Hep@PGEA) with self-accelerating NA release, is structurally designed. Hep@PGEA is composed of disulfide-bridged heparin nanoparticle (HepNP) core and low-toxicity PGEA cationic shell. In comparison with NA, heparin, a negatively charged polysaccharide macromolecule, exhibits stronger interactions with cationic species. Upon the breakdown of redox-responsive HepNP cores, unlocked heparin would interact with the outer cationic shells and replace the condensed NA to facilitate NA release. Such unique Hep@PGEA is successfully explored for effective miRNA-pDNA staged gene therapy of myocardial infarction (MI), one of the most serious CVDs. With the progression of MI, glutathione amounts in heart tissues increase. MiR-499 (for the inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis) and plasmid encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (for the promotion of angiogenesis) are sequentially delivered for systemic treatment of MI. Such treatment produces impressive results in restoring heart function and suppressing cardiac hypertrophy.

Thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of Nigella sativa L. seeds, has been reported to possess various biological activities. However, few reports regarding myocardial protection are available at present. Therefore, this study was conducted aiming to investigate the protective effect of TQ against MI/R injury and to clarify its potential mechanism.\nMI/R injury models of isolated rat hearts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were established. The Langendorff isolated perfused heart system, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, gene transfection, TransLaser scanning confocal microscopy, and western blotting were employed to evaluate the cardioprotection effect of TQ against MI/R injury.\nCompared with the MI/R group, TQ treatment could remarkably improve left ventricular function, decrease myocardial infarct size and production of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and attenuate mitochondrial oxidative damage by elevating superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malonaldehyde (MDA). Moreover, the cardioprotective effect of TQ was accompanied by up-regulated expression of SIRT1 and inhibition of p53 acetylation. Additionally, TQ treatment could also enhance mitochondrial function and reduce the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Nonetheless, the cardioprotective effect of TQ could be mitigated by SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol and SIRT1 siRNA, respectively, which was achieved through inhibition of the SIRT1 signaling pathway.\nThe findings in this study demonstrate that TQ is efficient in attenuating MI/R injury through activation of the SIRT1 signaling pathway, which can thus reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2018-06-19", "authors": ["YunyangLu", "YingdaFeng", "DanLiu", "ZhiranZhang", "KaiGao", "WeiZhang", "HaifengTang"], "doi": "10.1159/000490216"}

Recently, it has been shown that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiac fibrosis. Here, the inhibitory effects and possible mechanism of astragaloside IV (AST) and its active sapogenin cycloastragenol (CAG) on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis were investigated. In our study, BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 5\u202fmg/kg ISO for 7 consecutive days to induce cardiac fibrosis. AST or CAG was administrated to the mice intragastrically at different doses beginning on the same day of ISO injection. Primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of neonatal rats, and treated with 10\u202f\u03bcmol/L ISO for 24\u202fh with or without incubation of CAG simultaneously. The results indicated that 62.5\u202fmg/kg CAG could significantly inhibit ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis, which was evidenced by sirius red staining, collagen volume fraction and mRNA expressions of collagen-1, collagen-3 and TGF-\u03b21. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that 62.5\u202fmg/kg CAG markedly reduced the inflammatory cell infiltration in heart tissues. To elucidate the related mechanism, NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-18 pathway was studied. The mRNA expressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-6 in mice heart tissues were significantly down-regulated by 62.5\u202fmg/kg CAG and 200\u202fmg/kg AST.

Mechanical perturbation control has been recently used to suppress alternans in cardiac tissue of relevant size. In this control strategy, cardiac tissue mechanics are perturbed via active tension generated by the heart's electrical activity, which alters the tissue's electric wave profile through mechanoelectric coupling. We analyze the effects of mechanical perturbation on the dynamics of a map model that couples the membrane voltage and active tension systems at the cellular level. Therefore, a two-dimensional iterative map of the heart beat-to-beat dynamics is introduced, and a stability analysis of the system of coupled maps is performed in the presence of a mechanical perturbation algorithm. To this end, a bidirectional coupling between the membrane voltage and active tension systems in a single cardiac cell is provided, and a discrete form of the proposed control algorithm, that can be incorporated in the coupled maps, is derived. In addition, a realistic electromechanical model of cardiac tissue is employed to explore the feasibility of suppressing alternans at cellular and tissue levels. Electrical activity is represented in two detailed ionic models, the Luo-Rudy 1 and the Fox models, while two active contractile tension models, namely a smooth variant of the Nash-Panfilov model and the Niederer-Hunter-Smith model, are used to represent mechanical activity in the heart.

APODOX is both passively (through Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect) and actively targeted to tumors through prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) via mouse antibodies conjugated to the surface of horse spleen APO. To achieve site-directed conjugation of the antibodies, a HWRGWVC heptapeptide linker was used. The prostate cancer-targeted and non-targeted nanocarriers were tested using subcutaneously implanted LNCaP cells in athymic mice models, and compared to free DOX. Prostate cancer-targeted APODOX retained the high potency of DOX in attenuation of tumors (with 55% decrease in tumor volume after 3 weeks of treatment).

{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach to Examine Ischemic ST Changes in Ambulatory ECG Recordings.", "abstract": "Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at risk of transient myocardial ischemia (TMI), which could lead to serious morbidity or even mortality. Early detection of myocardial ischemia can reduce damage to heart tissues and improve patient condition. Significant ST change in the electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important marker for detecting myocardial ischemia during the rule-out phase of potential ACS. However, current ECG monitoring software is vastly underused due to excessive false alarms. The present study aims to tackle this problem by combining a novel image-based approach with deep learning techniques to improve the detection accuracy of significant ST depression change. The obtained convolutional neural network (CNN) model yields an average area under the curve (AUC) at 89.6% from an independent testing set. At selected optimal cutoff thresholds, the proposed model yields a mean sensitivity at 84.4% while maintaining specificity at 84.9%.", "journal": "AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

Overexpression of lncRNA-UIHTC in peri-infarction attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, lncRNA-UIHTC enhanced the mitochondrial function via upregulation of PGC1\u03b1. Moreover, when we knocked down PGC1\u03b1, the mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption and ATP levels enhanced by overexpression of UIHTC were nearly completely restored.\nAltogether we have provided a new mechanism whereby hypothermia protected heart against ischemic via lncRNA-UIHTC.

The objective of this study was to develop a simple and efficient method for low-temperature cultivation (< 37\u202f\u00b0C) that decreases cell metabolism for facilitating the buildup of 3D cardiac tissues. We created 3D cardiac tissues using cell sheet technology and analyzed the viability of the cardiac cells in low-temperature environments. To determine a method that would allow thicker 3D tissues to survive, we investigated the cardiac tissue viability under low-temperature culture processes at 20-33.5\u202f\u00b0C and compared it with the viability under the standard culture process at 37\u202f\u00b0C. Our results indicated that the standard culture process at 37\u202f\u00b0C was unable to support higher-density myocardial tissue; however, low-temperature culture conditions maintained dense myocardial tissue and prevascularization. To investigate the efficiency of transplantation, layered cell sheets produced by the low-temperature culture process were also transplanted under the skin of nude rats. Cardiac tissue cultured at 30\u202f\u00b0C developed denser prevascular networks than the tissue cultured at the standard temperature.

We evaluated the analytical and diagnostic performance of an existing qPCR assay in comparison to the 'gold standard' culture method using Pacific herring Clupea pallasii with known exposure history. We determined that the assay is suitable for use in this host, and diagnostic specificity was consistently high (>98%) in both heart and liver tissues. Diagnostic sensitivity could not be fully assessed due to low infection rates, but our results suggest that qPCR is not as sensitive as culture under all circumstances. Diagnostic sensitivity of qPCR relative to culture is likely affected by the amount of sample processed. The prevalence values estimated by the 2 methods were not significantly different when sample amounts were equal (heart tissue), but when the assayed sample amounts were unequal (liver tissue), the culture method detected a significantly higher prevalence of the parasite than qPCR. Further, culture of liver also detected significantly more Ichthyophonus infections than culture of heart, suggesting that the density and distribution of parasites in tissues also plays a role in assay sensitivity. This sensitivity issue would be most problematic for fish with light infections.

{"title": "Evaluation of Oxidative Stress in Cardiomyocytes during the Aging Process in Rats Treated with Resveratrol.", "abstract": "The substantial increase in the number of elderly people in our societies represents a challenge for biology and medicine. The societies of the industrialized countries are subject to a progressive aging process that translates into an increase in the cardiovascular risk of the population. In the present work, the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was evaluated, as well as markers of oxidative stress (concentration of nitric oxide and total lipoperoxidation in its main components: malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkene) in cardiomyocytes during the aging process in rats treated with resveratrol. Rats were divided into 4 groups according to the following categories: control (without treatment), negative control group (administered with physiological solution with 10% ethanol), positive control group (administered with vitamin E, 2\u2009mg/kg/day), and group administered with resveratrol (10\u2009mg/kg/day); these groups in turn were divided into 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of treatment. The analysis of nitric oxide showed a decreased level in the cardiac tissue in the groups treated with resveratrol; the same occurs when total lipoperoxidation is analyzed. The enzymatic activity studied (catalase and superoxide dismutase) did not present significant changes with respect to the controls. It is concluded that the cardioprotective effect of resveratrol is due to the antioxidant effect and other antiaging effects and not to the activation of the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2018-06-02", "authors": ["PAguilar-Alonso", "OVera-L\u00f3pez", "EBrambila-Colombres", "OSegura-Badilla", "RAvalos-L\u00f3pez", "MLazcano-Hern\u00e1ndez", "A RNavarro-Cruz"], "doi": "10.1155/2018/1390483\n10.1016/0531-5565(85)90032-4\n10.1111/j.1469-185X.1990.tb01428.x\n10.1093/geronj/11.3.298\n10.1016/0531-5565(90)90017-V\n10.1016/0891-5849(90)90127-5\n10.4067/S0717-75262015000600009\n10.3389/fphar.2012.00141\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2007.04.006\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.03.020\n10.1007/s00424-010-0808-2\n10.1016/S0009-9120(98)00013-7\n10.1093/aje/kwf029\n10.1080/10715760600592962\n10.2174/157340607779317580\n10.15381/anales.v57i4.4897\n10.5867/medwave.2002.07.3608\n10.1155/2017/8510761\n10.1016/j.jchromb.2006.07.054\n10.1016/0003-2697(77)90428-6\n10.1021/tx9701790\n10.1016/S0076-6879(84)05016-3\n10.1096/fj.11-1102.ufm\n10.1093/gerona/gls082\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039\n10.1093/geronj/20.2.151\n10.1161/01.RES.0000267723.65696.4a\n10.1254/jphs.08R01CR\n10.1124/jpet.112.198937\n10.3390/nu6104404\n10.1024/0300-9831.73.4.275\n10.3390/ph8040865\n10.1139/cjpp-2016-0512\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.09.025\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.006\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.06.011\n10.1016/j.abb.2012.05.002\n10.4077/CJP.2011.AMM097\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.06.010\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.036\n10.1177/1479164114565629"}

Diastolic dysfunction is caused by changes in intrinsic properties of cardiomyocytes or an increase in fibrosis. We investigated whether clinical and cellular parameters of diastolic function are different between male and female patients with HCM at the time of myectomy.\nCardiac tissue from the interventricular septum of patients with HCM (27 women and 44 men) was obtained during myectomy preceded by echocardiography. At myectomy, female patients were 7 years older than male patients and showed more advanced diastolic dysfunction than men evident from significantly higher values for E/e' ratio, left ventricular filling pattern, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and left atrial diameter indexed for body surface. Whereas most male patients (56%) showed mild (grade I) diastolic dysfunction, 50% of female patients showed grade III diastolic dysfunction. Passive tension in HCM cardiomyocytes was comparable with controls, and myofilament calcium sensitivity was higher in HCM compared with controls, but no sex differences were observed in myofilament function. In female patients with HCM, titin was more compliant, and more fibrosis was present compared with men. Differences between female and male patients with HCM remained significant after correction for age.\nFemale patients with HCM are older at the time of myectomy and show greater impairment of diastolic function. Furthermore, left ventricular and left atrial remodeling is increased in women when corrected for body surface area.

Regeneration and integration of damaged cardiac tissue is challenging since the functional restoration of the injured myocardium is an incredible task. The injured micro environment of myocardium fails to regenerate spontaneously. The emergence of nano-biomaterials would be a promising approach to regenerate such a damaged cardiomyocytes tissue. Here, we have fabricated a dual bioactive embedded nanofibrous cardiac patch via coaxial electrospinning technique, to mimic the topographical and chemical cues of the natural cardiac tissue. The proportion and the concentration of the polymers were optimized for tailored delivery of bioactives from a spatio-temporally designed scaffold. The functionalization of polymeric core shell nanofibrous scaffold with dual bioactives enhanced the physico-chemical and bio-mechanical properties of the scaffolds that has resulted in a 3-dimensional topography mimicking the natural cardiac like extracellular matrix. The sustained delivery of bioactive signals, improved cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation could be attributed to its highly interconnected nanofibrous matrix with good extended morphology. Further, the expression of cardiac specific markers were found to increase on investigation of mRNA by real time PCR studies and proteins by immunofluorescence and western blotting techniques, confirming cell - biomaterial interactions. Flow cytometry analysis authenticated a potent mitochondrial membrane potential of cells treated with nanocomposite. In addition, in ovo studies in chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay confirm the efficacy of the developed scaffold in inducing angiogenesis required for maintaining its viability after transplantation onto the infarcted zone. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the composite nanofibrous scaffold as an effective biomaterial substrate for cardiac regeneration providing cues for development of novel cardiac therapeutics.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Spiral waves characterization: Implications for an automated cardiodynamic tissue characterization.", "abstract": "Spiral waves are phenomena observed in cardiac tissue especially during fibrillatory activities. Spiral waves are revealed through in-vivo and in-vitro studies using high density mapping that requires special experimental setup. Also, in-silico spiral wave analysis and classification is performed using membrane potentials from entire tissue. In this study, we report a characterization approach that identifies spiral wave behaviors using intracardiac electrogram (EGM) readings obtained with commonly used multipolar diagnostic catheters that perform localized but high-resolution readings. Specifically, the algorithm is designed to distinguish between stationary, meandering, and break-up rotors.\nThe clustering and classification algorithms are tested on simulated data produced using a phenomenological 2D model of cardiac propagation. For EGM measurements, unipolar-bipolar EGM readings from various locations on tissue using two catheter types are modeled. The distance measure between spiral behaviors are assessed using normalized compression distance (NCD), an information theoretical distance. NCD is a universal metric in the sense it is solely based on compressibility of dataset and not requiring feature extraction. We also introduce normalized FFT distance (NFFTD) where compressibility is replaced with a FFT parameter.\nOverall, outstanding clustering performance was achieved across varying EGM reading configurations. We found that effectiveness in distinguishing was superior in case of NCD than NFFTD. We demonstrated that distinct spiral activity identification on a behaviorally heterogeneous tissue is also possible.\nThis report demonstrates a theoretical validation of clustering and classification approaches that provide an automated mapping from EGM signals to assessment of spiral wave behaviors and hence offers a potential mapping and analysis framework for cardiac tissue wavefront propagation patterns.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2018-06-02", "authors": ["CelalAlagoz", "Andrew RCohen", "Daniel RFrisch", "BirkanTun\u00e7", "SaranPhatharodom", "AllonGuez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.04.006"}
{"title": "Reg proteins direct accumulation of functionally distinct macrophage subsets after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) causes a massive increase of macrophages in the heart, which serve various non-redundant functions for cardiac repair. The identities of signals controlling recruitment of functionally distinct cardiac macrophages to sites of injury are only partially known. Previous work identified Regenerating islet-derived protein 3 beta (Reg3\u03b2) as a novel factor directing macrophages to sites of myocardial injury. Herein, we aim to characterize functionally distinct macrophage subsets and understand the impact of different members of the Reg protein family including Reg3\u03b2, Reg3\u03b3, and Reg4 on their accumulation in the infarcted heart.\nWe have determined dynamic changes of three phenotypically distinct tissue macrophage subpopulations in the mouse heart after MI by flow cytometry. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis identified inflammatory gene expression patterns in MHC-IIhi/Ly6Clo and MHC-IIlo/Ly6Clo cardiac tissue macrophages while Ly6Chi cardiac tissue macrophages are characterized by gene activities associated with healing and revascularization of damaged tissue. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed specific roles of Reg proteins for recruitment of cardiac tissue macrophage subpopulations to the site of myocardial injury. We found that expression of Reg3\u03b2, Reg3\u03b3, and Reg4 is strongly increased after MI in mouse and human hearts with Reg3\u03b2 providing the lead, followed by Reg3\u03b3 and Reg4. Inactivation of the Reg3\u03b2 gene prevented the increase of all types of cardiac tissue macrophages shortly after MI whereas local delivery of Reg3\u03b2, Reg3\u03b3, and Reg4 selectively stimulated recruitment of MHC-IIhi/Ly6Clo and MHC-IIlo/Ly6Clo but repressed accumulation of Ly6Chi cardiac tissue macrophages.\nWe conclude that distinct cardiac macrophage subpopulations are characterized by substantially different gene expression patterns reflecting their pathophysiological role after MI. We argue that sequential, local production of Reg proteins orchestrates accumulation of macrophage subsets, which seem to act in a parallel or partially overlapping rather than in a successive manner.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2018-06-01", "authors": ["HolgerL\u00f6rchner", "YunlongHou", "Juan MAdrian-Segarra", "JenniferKulhei", "JuliaDetzer", "StefanG\u00fcnther", "PraveenGajawada", "HenningWarnecke", "Hans WNiessen", "JochenP\u00f6ling", "ThomasBraun"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvy126"}

{"title": "Prorenin independently causes hypertension and renal and cardiac fibrosis in cyp1a1-prorenin transgenic rats.", "abstract": "Plasma prorenin is commonly elevated in diabetic patients and appears to predict the development of diabetic nephropathy. However, the pathological role of prorenin is unclear. In the present study, a transgenic, inducible, hepatic prorenin-overexpressing rat model was generated and the effect of prorenin in organ injury was examined. Four groups of rats (cyp1a1 prorenin transgenic male and female rats and non-transgenic littermates) were assigned to receive a diet containing 0.3% of the transgene inducer indole-3-carbinol (I3C) for 4 weeks. Plasma prorenin concentration was increased and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 80 \u00b1 18 to 138 \u00b1 17 (mmHg), whereas renal prorenin/renin protein expression was unchanged, in transgenic rats fed with I3C diet. The intact prorenin, not renin, in plasma and urine samples was further observed by Western blot analysis. Importantly, transgenic rats with high levels of prorenin developed albuminuria, glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis associated with increased expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) 1 (TGF\u03b21), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), collagen, and fibronectin (FN). These rats also exhibited cardiac hypertrophy determined by echocardiography, with elevated ratio of heart weight to body weight (HW/BW).

As the NF\u2011\u03baB pathway plays a critical role in muscular atrophy associated with cancer cachexia, we aimed to investigate the potential of luteolin to alleviate cancer\u2011associated cachexia in a Lewis lung cancer mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: A control group, a model group and a luteolin group. Mice in the model and luteolin groups received a subcutaneous injection of Lewis lung cancer cells, while the control group received PBS. Subsequently, the tumor mass, serum, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were collected on day\u00a021. The serum, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were weighed and prepared for use in enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2011PCR) analyses. The results revealed that the tumor\u2011free body mass was significantly reduced in tumor\u2011bearing mice compared with that of mice in the other groups. The gastrocnemius muscle mass and heart mass were greater in the luteolin treatment group than in the control group. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)\u20116 levels were lower in the luteolin treatment group than in the model group. In addition, according to the results of the WB and qRT\u2011PCR analyses, the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase muscle RING finger\u2011containing protein\u00a01 (MuRF1) was downregulated in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, whereas atrogin\u20111 was downregulated only in skeletal muscle in the luteolin treatment group vs. the model group. Furthermore, I\u03baB kinase\u00a0\u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) and phospho\u2011p65 were significantly downregulated in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue, whereas the expression of p\u2011p38 was downregulated only in skeletal muscle in the luteolin treatment group when compared with their expression levels in the model group, as determined by the WB analysis. In conclusion, from the current results, we conclude that luteolin is able to reduce inflammatory burden, downregulate the expression of genes associated with muscle protein breakdown, and protect skeletal and heart muscle from cancer\u2011induced wasting and loss in\u00a0vivo. Therefore, luteolin has the potential to be developed into a novel anti\u2011cachetic agent.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2018-05-31", "authors": ["TiejunChen", "BinLi", "YeXu", "ShuyingMeng", "YuanWang", "YanJiang"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2018.6453"}

The present study investigated whether these effects may be applied to acute myocardial infarction (MI) and examined the underlying mechanisms of leonurine treatment. A rat model of MI was induced by coronary artery ligation. Leonurine was administered at 15\u00a0mg/kg/day by oral gavage following the onset of MI. Rats in the sham group and the saline group were administered with an equal volume of saline. Echocardiography, Masson's trichrome staining, and terminal\u2011deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2011mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays were performed 28\u00a0days post MI.

In this study, these nanocapsules showed a similar antitumour effect in comparison to the free doxorubicin (DOX) treatment, but showed no evident DOX-related cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity. The histopathological analysis showed that the free DOX treatment induced more intense morphological damage to myocardial tissues in comparison to NCS-DOX treatment. Animals treated with free DOX presented important muscle fibre degradation and animals treated with NCS-DOX, heart tissue did not present signals of muscle fibre degeneration. These results indicate that the cardiotoxicity related to DOX is reduced when this drug is carried by the NCS-DOX. Noteworthy, biodistribution analyses showed that NCS-DOX accumulated more intensely in tumours than the free DOX.

We hypothesize that time-dependent phenomapping of clinical and molecular data sets is a valuable approach to clinical assessments and guiding medical management to improve outcomes.\nWe analyzed clinical, therapeutic, biomarker, and outcome data from 94 adult HTx patients and 1,557 clinical encounters performed between January 2010 and April 2013. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between immunosuppression therapy, biomarkers, and the combined clinical end point of death, allograft loss, retransplantation, and rejection. Data were analyzed by K-means clustering (K = 2) to identify patterns of similar combined immunosuppression management, and percentile slopes were computed to examine the changes in dosages over time. Findings were correlated with clinical parameters, human leucocyte antigen antibody titers, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression of the AlloMap (CareDx, Inc., Brisbane, CA) test genes. An intragraft, heart tissue gene coexpression network analysis was performed.\nUnsupervised cluster analysis of immunosuppressive therapies identified 2 groups, 1 characterized by a steeper immunosuppression minimization, associated with a higher likelihood for the combined end point, and the other by a less pronounced change. A time-dependent phenomap suggested that patients in the group with higher event rates had increased human leukocyte antigen class I and II antibody titers, higher expression of the FLT3 AlloMap gene, and lower expression of the MARCH8 and WDR40A AlloMap genes.

{"title": "Carbon nanotube scaffolds as emerging nanoplatform for myocardial tissue regeneration: A review of recent developments and therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (cardiac tissue death) is among the most prevalent causes of death among the cardiac patients due to the inability of self-repair in cardiac tissues. Myocardial tissue engineering is regarded as one of the most realistic strategies for repairing damaged cardiac tissue. However, hindrance in transduction of electric signals across the cardiomyocytes due to insulating properties of polymeric materials worsens the clinical viability of myocardial tissue engineering. Aligned and conductive scaffolds based on Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have gained remarkable recognition due to their exceptional attributes which provide synthetic but viable microenvironment for regeneration of engineered cardiomyocytes. This review presents an overview and critical analysis of pharmaceutical implications and therapeutic feasibility of CNT based scaffolds in improving the cardiac tissue regeneration and functionality. The expository analysis of the available evidence revealed that inclusion of single- or multi-walled CNT into fibrous, polymeric, and elastomeric scaffolds results in significant improvement in electrical stimulation and signal transduction through cardiomyocytes. Moreover, incorporation of CNT in engineering scaffolds showed a greater potential of augmenting cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation, and maturation and has improved synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes. Despite promising ability of CNT in promoting functionality of cardiomyocytes, their presence in scaffolds resulted in substantial improvement in mechanical properties and structural integrity. Conclusively, this review provides new insight into the remarkable potential of CNT aligned scaffolds in improving the functionality of engineered cardiac tissue and signifies their feasibility in cardiac tissue regenerative medicines and stem cell therapy.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-05-26", "authors": ["BapiGorain", "HiraChoudhury", "ManishaPandey", "PrashantKesharwani", "Muhammad MustafaAbeer", "Rakesh KumarTekade", "ZahidHussain"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.05.066"}
{"title": "Fluoride induced tissue hypercalcemia, IL-17 mediated inflammation and apoptosis lead to cardiomyopathy: Ultrastructural and biochemical findings.", "abstract": "An increased prevalence of cardiac complications has been observed in residents of fluorosis endemic areas chronically exposed to fluoride. Fluoride induces soft tissue injury due to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and mitochondriopathy. It was hypothesized that chronic fluoride exposure induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes due to inflammation, lysis of extra cellular matrix and altered calcium metabolism. This study was planned to evaluate the effects of chronic fluoride exposure and the mechanism of action in the cardiac muscle. Fifteen week old male Wistar rats were administered a human equivalent dose of fluoride (50 and 100\u202fppm ad-libitum, HED\u202f=\u202f5 & 10\u202fppm in human) for 75-days. After 75-days of fluoride exposure, the animals were euthanized and fluoride, oxidative stress (SOD, GPX, Catalase activities) and LPO were measured. Histopathological and ultrastructural pathological examinations were conducted on the cardiac tissues using light, atomic force and electron microscopies. The cardiac tissues were also assessed for apoptosis (TUNEL/Caspase assays), and tissue calcium levels (Alizarin-assay and SEM-EDX). Tissue inflammation and expression of IL-17, MMP-9, Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were evaluated. In the fluoride exposed groups, a significant (\u22640.05) increase in levels of oxidative stress, LPO and apoptosis were observed. The IL-17, MMP-9 and Caspase-3 were significantly (\u22640.05) higher in the cardiac muscle after chronic fluoride exposure. The fluoride seems to have induced inflammation in the cardiac tissues, as well as an increase in tissue calcium (\u22640.05). There was significant damage to cardiac muscle fibres including, thinning, distortion and neo-vasculogenesis following chronic fluoride exposure. Mitochondriopathy, lysis of ground substance, oedema, and hyper-vacuolation was seen in fluoride treated groups. Remarkable levels of distortion and bending in Z band were observed under the AFM. Many of these observed changes mimic those occurring in cardiomegaly, cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathies.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2018-05-26", "authors": ["Javed AhsanQuadri", "SabaSarwar", "NonePinky", "ParmitaKar", "SeemaSingh", "Saumya RanjanMallick", "SudheerArava", "Tapash ChandNag", "Tara SankarRoy", "AShariff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2018.05.012"}

Integrin \u03b23 is one of the main integrin heterodimer receptors on the surface of cardiac myocytes. However, despite the important role that integrin \u03b23 plays in the cardiovascular disease, its exact role in the hypoxia response remains unclear. Hence, in the present investigation we aimed to study the role of integrin \u03b23 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells and primary rat myocardial cells. MTT assay, flow cytometry and TUNEL assay results showed that hypoxia inhibited cardiomyocyte proliferation and induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The expression levels of integrin \u03b23 and HIF1\u03b1 were upregulated in hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes as revealed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore, knockdown of integrin \u03b23 expression by siRNA increased hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In addition, integrin \u03b23 overexpression weakened hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The protein expressions of integrin \u03b23 and HIF1\u03b1 were upregulated in acute myocardial infarction rat cardiac tissues compared with the control rat cardiac tissues.

The improvements in reprogramming and differentiating methods achieved in the past 10 years widened the use of hiPSCs, especially in cardiac research. hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (CMs) recapitulate phenotypic differences caused by genetic variations, making them attractive human disease models and useful tools for drug discovery and toxicology testing. In addition, hiPSCs can be used as sources of cells for cardiac regeneration in animal models. Here, we review the advances in the genetic and epigenetic control of cardiomyogenesis that underlies the significant improvement of the induced reprogramming of somatic cells to CMs; the methods used to improve scalability of throughput assays for functional screening and drug testing in vitro; the phenotypic characteristics of hiPSCs-derived CMs and their ability to rescue injured CMs through paracrine effects; we also cover the novel approaches in tissue engineering for hiPSC-derived cardiac tissue generation, and finally, their immunological features and the potential use in biomedical applications.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2018-05-26", "authors": ["AngelaDi Baldassarre", "ElisaCimetta", "SvevaBollini", "GiuliaGaggi", "BarbaraGhinassi"], "doi": "10.3390/cells7060048\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu299\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1155/2015/138148\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000152\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.molmed.2008.12.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300556\n10.1021/bm4010639\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.013\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000068356.38592.68\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.06.009\n10.1038/ncb2304\n10.1093/cvr/cvr158\n10.1126/science.1060063\n10.1016/j.tem.2012.06.001\n10.1093/abbs/gmr090\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.027\n10.1172/JCI44641\n10.1007/s11515-014-1340-0\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.11.009\n10.1146/annurev-genet-112414-054911\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.01.021\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1038/s41467-017-02762-z\n10.1093/cvr/cvr019\n10.1073/pnas.1410622111\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.01.003\n10.1186/s13287-016-0454-5\n10.1016/j.devcel.2012.12.012\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.197434\n10.1111/cpr.12371\n10.15252/embj.201387605\n10.1073/pnas.1608256113\n10.1186/s12929-017-0337-9\n10.1002/wsbm.111\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1074/jbc.M707391200\n10.1101/gad.1563807\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.021\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311080\n10.1182/blood-2012-06-434407\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.04.056\n10.1177/1535370215589910\n10.1016/j.lfs.2015.12.023\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0110\n10.1038/nmeth.1740\n10.1002/stem.1964\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.1038/nmeth.3448\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.002\n10.1016/j.scr.2011.04.007\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.017\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0275\n10.1002/jcp.25101\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0598\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.033\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/cr.2013.102\n10.1002/bit.22065\n10.3727/096368910X513955\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.06.015\n10.1093/bmb/ldn026\n10.1016/j.cherd.2013.08.021\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.09.007\n10.1016/j.jsb.2006.11.009\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.2000.tb01189.x\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1056/NEJMsr040330\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01417.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192237\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0183\n10.1161/01.CIR.86.2.426\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018037\n10.1210/jc.2013-2305\n10.1186/1471-2458-13-883\n10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181c29e79\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.751412\n10.1089/scd.2009.0052\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2007.05.035\n10.1096/fj.05-4501fje\n10.1196/annals.1380.017\n10.1016/j.scr.2010.01.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018293\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.10.014\n10.1038/nature09855\n10.1056/NEJMoa0908679\n10.1242/dmm.008409\n10.1152/ajpheart.00694.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223917\n10.1038/cr.2010.163\n10.1172/JCI45529\n10.1172/JCI200112131\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707619\n10.1089/scd.2011.0312\n10.1093/toxsci/kfw069\n10.1038/nature10188\n10.1155/2016/1314709\n10.1096/fj.05-5211com\n10.1021/mp400258d\n10.1371/journal.pone.0101024\n10.1038/srep11235\n10.1002/stem.2078\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309307\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310803\n10.1038/435268a\n10.1038/nbt1005-1237\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.10.015\n10.1177/1535370214530369\n10.1039/C2LC40836H\n10.1002/jat.1663\n10.1007/s12015-017-9736-2\n10.1002/term.2460\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1038/ncomms10312\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1186/scrt369\n10.1038/srep34154\n10.1111/bph.13577\n10.1093/toxsci/kfw235\n10.1093/toxsci/kfu150\n10.1038/nm.4087\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.03.008\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf2584\n10.1093/toxsci/kfu312\n10.1093/toxsci/kfx082\n10.1016/j.vascn.2016.06.002\n10.1002/jat.3611\n10.1016/j.vascn.2016.06.004\n10.1016/j.yrtph.2017.06.006\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00996.x\n10.1007/s00204-016-1668-0\n10.3390/ijms160818894\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i2.329\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.865154\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173222\n10.1038/nmat2441\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv189\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.047\n10.2217/rme-2016-0134\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000144\n10.1167/iovs.14-15619\n10.4061/2011/673752\n10.1371/journal.pone.0106110\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.07.021\n10.1038/ncomms4903\n10.1007/s40778-015-0011-7\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.006\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.36"}
{"title": "Excessive training induces molecular signs of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Chronic exercise induces cardiac remodeling that promotes left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac functional improvement, which are mediated by the mammalian or the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) as well as by the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). However, pathological conditions (i.e., chronic heart failure, hypertension, and aortic stenosis, etc.) also induce cardiac hypertrophy, but with detrimental function, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and myostatin, elevated fibrosis, reduced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, and fetal gene reactivation. Furthermore, recent studies have evidenced that excessive training induced an inflammatory status in the serum, muscle, hypothalamus, and liver, suggesting a pathological condition that could also be detrimental to cardiac tissue. Here, we verified the effects of three running overtraining (OT) models on the molecular parameters related to physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. C57BL/6 mice performed three different OT protocols and were evaluated for molecular parameters related to physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy, including immunoblotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, histology, and immunohistochemistry analyses. In summary, the three OT protocols induced left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy with signs of cardiac fibrosis and negative morphological adaptations. These maladaptations were accompanied by reductions in AMPKalpha (Thr172) phosphorylation, androgen receptor, and GR expressions, as well as by an increase in interleukin-6 expression. Specifically, the downhill running-based OT model reduced the content of some proteins related to the mTOR signaling pathway and upregulated the \u03b2-isoform of myosin heavy-chain gene expression, presenting signs of LV pathological hypertrophy development.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2018-05-26", "authors": ["Alisson Lda Rocha", "Giovana RTeixeira", "Ana PPinto", "Gustavo Pde Morais", "Luciana da COliveira", "Larissa Gaiotode Vicente", "Lilian E C Mda Silva", "Jos\u00e9 RPauli", "Dennys ECintra", "Eduardo RRopelle", "Leandro Pde Moura", "Rania AMekary", "Ellen Cde Freitas", "Adelino S Rda Silva"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.26799"}

{"title": "Catecholamine-Induced Senescence of Endothelial Cells and Bone Marrow Cells Promotes Cardiac Dysfunction in Mice.", "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that cellular senescence plays a central role in the progression of pathologic changes in the failing heart. It is well known that the sympathetic nervous system is activated in patients with heart failure, and this change is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Sympathetic activation increases the levels of various catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, but the contribution of these catecholamines to cellular senescence associated with heart failure remains to be determined. We found that catecholamine infusion induced senescence of endothelial cells and bone marrow cells, and promoted cardiac dysfunction in mice. In C57BL/6NCr mice, the continuous infusion of isoproterenol-induced cardiac inflammation and cardiac dysfunction. Expression of p53, a master regulator of cellular senescence, was increased in the cardiac tissue and bone marrow cells of these mice. Suppression of cellular senescence by genetic deletion of p53 in endothelial cells or bone marrow cells led to improvement of isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction. In vitro studies showed that adrenergic signaling increased the expression of p53 and adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and macrophages. Our results indicate that catecholamine-induced senescence of endothelial cells and bone marrow cells plays a pivotal role in the progression of heart failure.

Thus, finding effective treatment and exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy is urgently necessary. Astragaloside IV (AST-IV) is the main active component, extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus. Previous studies have indicated that AST-IV has various bioactivities, such as anti-cancer, anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effects of AST-IV on cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic banding (AB) surgery in mice, and to reveal the underlying signaling mechanisms. The suppressor of IKK\u03b5 (SIKE) is a negative regulator of the interferon pathway, which could be enhanced by AST-IV to ameliorate pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice through inactivating TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AST-IV attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, collagen accumulation and abnormal cardiac functions. In addition, AB-induced apoptosis and inflammation in the heart tissue samples of mice, which were attenuated by AST-IV administration through inhibiting SIKE expression levels. Together, the findings above indicated that AST-IV might be a potential candidate to prevent cardiac hypertrophy via elevating SIKE to suppress TBK1/PI3K/AKT activity.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-05-26", "authors": ["Zhen-HuLiu", "Hong-BoLiu", "JunWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.09.092"}
{"title": "Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue.", "abstract": "We have developed our original tissue engineering technology \"cell sheet engineering\" utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this \"cell sheet engineering\", we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and in vitro drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm2.

{"title": "Role of adenosine signaling in coordinating cardiomyocyte function and coronary vascular growth in chronic fetal anemia.", "abstract": "Fetal anemia causes rapid and profound changes in cardiac structure and function, stimulating proliferation of the cardiac myocytes, expansion of the coronary vascular tree, and impairing early contraction and relaxation. Although hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 is sure to play a role, adenosine, a metabolic byproduct that increases coronary flow and growth, is implicated as a major stimulus for these adaptations. We hypothesized that genes involved in myocardial adenosine signaling would be upregulated in chronically anemic fetuses and that calcium-handling genes would be downregulated. After sterile surgical instrumentation under anesthesia, gestationally timed fetal sheep were made anemic by isovolumetric hemorrhage for 1 wk (16% vs. 35% hematocrit). At 87% of gestation, necropsy was performed to collect heart tissue for PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Anemia increased mRNA expression levels of adenosine receptors ADORA 1, ADORA2A, and ADORA2B in the left and right ventricles (adenosine receptor ADORA3 was unchanged). In both ventricles, anemia also increased expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase. The genes for both equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 were expressed more abundantly in the anemic right ventricle but were not different in the left ventricle. Neither adenosine deaminase nor adenosine kinase cardiac levels were significantly changed by chronic fetal anemia. Chronic fetal anemia did not significantly change cardiac mRNA expression levels of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel, ryanodine receptor 1, sodium-calcium exchanger, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting ATPase 2, phospholamban, or cardiac calsequestrin.

{"title": "The role of miRNA regulation in fetal cardiomyocytes, cardiac maturation and the risk of heart disease in adults.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a primary contributor towards the global burden of cardiovascular disease. Rather than repairing the existing damage of myocardial infarction, current treatments only address the symptoms of the disease and reducing the risk of a secondary infarction. Cardiac regenerative capacity is dependent on cardiomyocyte proliferation, which concludes soon after birth in humans and precocial species such as sheep. Human fetal cardiac tissue has some ability to repair following tissue damage, whereas a fully matured human heart has minimal capacity for cellular regeneration. This is in contrast to neonatal mice and adult zebrafish hearts, which retain the ability to undergo cardiomyocyte proliferation and can regenerate cardiac tissue after birth. In mice and zebrafish models, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in cardiac cell cycle progression and regeneration. However, the significance of miRNA regulation in cardiomyocyte proliferation for humans and other large mammals, where the timing of heart development in relation to birth is similar, remains unclear. miRNAs may be valuable targets for therapies that promote cardiac repair after injury. Therefore, elucidating the role of specific miRNAs in large animals, where heart development closely resembles that of humans, remains vitally important for identifying therapeutic targets that may be translated into clinical practice focused on tissue repair.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2018-05-23", "authors": ["Mitchell CLock", "Ross LTellam", "Kimberley JBotting", "Kimberley C WWang", "Joseph BSelvanayagam", "Doug ABrooks", "MikeSeed", "Janna LMorrison"], "doi": "10.1113/JP276072"}

Poultry products may pose a risk to humans, when consumed undercooked. In addition, chickens are regarded as sensitive indicators for environmental contamination with T. gondii oocysts and have been used as sentinels. The aim of the present study was to determine the suitability of commonly used antibody detection methods, i.e. the modified agglutination test (MAT), IFAT and ELISA to detect T. gondii-infected chickens. Samples of experimentally and naturally infected chickens were used. The infection state of all chickens was determined by Magnetic-Capture (MC-) real-time PCR (RT PCR). Naturally exposed chickens were additionally examined by mouse bioassay and conventional RT PCR on acidic pepsin digests (PD-RT PCR). Blood serum and meat juice of various sources were tested for antibodies to T. gondii. In naturally infected chickens, there was substantial agreement between the mouse bioassay and MC-RT PCR or the mouse bioassay and conventional PD-RT PCR. PD-RT PCR was slightly more sensitive than MC-RT PCR, as all (26/26) bioassay-positive chickens also tested positive in at least one of the tissues tested (heart, drumstick). By MC-RT PCR, 92.3% (24/26) of the naturally infected bioassay-positive chickens were positive. The diagnostic sensitivity of MC-RT PCR was clearly related to the organ examined. Based on a quantitative assessment of the MC-RT PCR results in experimentally infected chickens, brain and heart tissues harbored an at least 100\u202ftimes higher parasite concentration than breast, thigh or drumstick musculature. In naturally infected chickens, only three out of 24 birds, which were MC-RT PCR-positive in heart samples, also tested positive in drumstick musculature. Under experimental conditions, the agreement between MC-RT PCR and the serological techniques revealed 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Under field conditions, examinations of sera by ELISA, IFAT and MAT showed good performance in identifying chickens that were positive in either a mouse bioassay, MC-RT PCR, or PD-RT PCR as illustrated by diagnostic sensitivities of 87.5%, 87.5% and 65.2%, respectively, and diagnostic specificities of 86.2%, 82.8% and 100%, respectively. The examination of meat juice samples from breast, drumstick or heart musculature revealed similar or even better results in the ELISA. The results in the MAT with meat juice from breast musculature were less consistent than those of ELISA and IFAT because a number of negative chickens tested false-positive in the MAT.

DS was orally administered for 7\u00a0days at doses of 2, 10, and 50\u00a0mg/kg/day. DOX (30\u00a0mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered on the 5th day of the initiation of DS treatment. Within 48\u00a0h of injection, DOX treatment significantly altered ECG, elevated the ST height, and increased the QT and QRS intervals. It reduced the cardiac levels of injury markers like creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB and lactate dehydrogenase. DOX elevated the serum levels of SGOT and nitric oxide. Its injection significantly induced lipid peroxidation in the cardiac tissue and reduced the activities of innate antioxidants like super oxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione in the cardiac tissue. DOX treatment raised the TNF-\u03b1 level and caused histological alterations in the myocardium like neutrophil infiltrations, myonecrosis, and edema. Pre-treatment of rats with DS (2, 10, and 50\u00a0mg/kg p. o. for 7\u00a0days) prevented the ECG changes, minimized oxidative stress, and normalized the biochemical indicators of the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. DS also protected rat heart from DOX-induced histological alterations. Recently, DS is reported to exert chemosensitization of cancer cells. Our in vitro investigation using MCF7 cell line revealed that DS reverses the DOX-induced suppression of NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 expression. These findings about the protective activity of DS against the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity warrant a detailed investigation on its utility as an adjunct therapy to cancer chemotherapy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2018-05-21", "authors": ["Varsha KSonawane", "Umesh BMahajan", "Sachin DShinde", "SubhajitChatterjee", "Sandip SChaudhari", "Harshada ABhangale", "ShreeshOjha", "Sameer NGoyal", "Chanakya NKundu", "Chandragouda RPatil"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-018-9458-y"}
{"title": "Effect of heptanol and ethanol on excitation wave propagation in a neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayer.", "abstract": "In this work, the action of heptanol and ethanol was investigated in a two-dimensional (2D) model of cardiac tissue: the neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayer. Heptanol is known in electrophysiology as a gap junction uncoupler but may also inhibit voltage-gated ionic channels. Ethanol is often associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias. These substances influence sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, but the complete mechanism of action of heptanol and ethanol remains unknown. The optical mapping method was used to measure conduction velocities (CVs) in concentrations of 0.05-1.8\u202fmM heptanol and 17-1342\u202fmM ethanol. Heptanol was shown to slow the excitation wave significantly, and a mechanism that involves a simultaneous action on cell coupling and activation threshold was suggested. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed inhibition of sodium and calcium currents at a concentration of 0.5\u202fmM heptanol. Computer modeling was used to estimate the relative contribution of the cell uncoupling and activation threshold increase caused by heptanol. Unlike heptanol, ethanol slightly influenced the CV at clinically relevant concentrations.

{"title": "Discretization-dependent model for weakly connected excitable media.", "abstract": "Pattern formation has been widely observed in extended chemical and biological processes. Although the biochemical systems are highly heterogeneous, homogenized continuum approaches formed by partial differential equations have been employed frequently. Such approaches are usually justified by the difference of scales between the heterogeneities and the characteristic spatial size of the patterns. Under different conditions, for example, under weak coupling, discrete models are more adequate. However, discrete models may be less manageable, for instance, in terms of numerical implementation and mesh generation, than the associated continuum models. Here we study a model to approach discreteness which permits the computer implementation on general unstructured meshes. The model is cast as a partial differential equation but with a parameter that depends not only on heterogeneities sizes, as in the case of quasicontinuum models, but also on the discretization mesh. Therefore, we refer to it as a discretization-dependent model. We validate the approach in a generic excitable media that simulates three different phenomena: the propagation of action membrane potential in cardiac tissue, in myelinated axons of neurons, and concentration waves in chemical microemulsions.", "journal": "Physical review.

Therefore, the objective of the present study is to improve the therapeutic efficacy and prevention of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced toxicity, by the concurrent use of Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C). In this study, I3C was administered (20\u202fmg/kg b.w., p.o.) to breast adenocarcinoma (Ehrlich ascites carcinoma) induced solid tumor bearing mice alone as well as in combination with DOX (5\u202fmg/kg b.w., i.p.) in concomitant and pretreatment schedule. The results showed that concurrent administration of I3C and DOX significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) improved therapeutic efficacy as evidenced by reduction of tumor size and enhancement of host survivability. Oral administration of I3C significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) inhibited the expression of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in both tumor cells and cardiac tissue as well as maximizes the therapeutic outcome in terms of tumor cell killing and toxicity. In addition, I3C sensitized tumor cells to DOX-therapy by down-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and by up-regulating molecules like Bax, cytochrome c, caspases, which led to PARP cleavage and apoptosis. Significant inhibition of angiogenesis along with reduction in the serum levels of VEGF-A and MMP-9 further contribute to the sensitization accomplished by I3C. Moreover, we also found that I3C provided additional host survival advantages by attenuated DOX-induced toxicities through modulation of Nrf2/ARE pathway and promoted expression of cytoprotective proteins HO-1, NQO1 and GST\u03c0 in cardiac tissue. In addition, I3C significantly attenuated DOX-induced inflammation by down-regulation of NF-k\u03b2, iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6 in cardiac tissue.

The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6th partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NF\u03baB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase \u03b11 heterozygous (\u03b11+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase \u03b11 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the \u03b11+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NF\u03baB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from \u03b11+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from \u03b11+/- mice. Inhibition of NF\u03baB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the in vivo effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD.

{"title": "Humanin analog enhances the protective effect of dexrazoxane against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The chemotherapeutic effect of doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity in cancer survivors. Dexrazoxane (DRZ) is approved to prevent Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Humanin and its synthetic analog HNG have a cytoprotective effect on the heart. To investigate the cardioprotective efficacy of HNG alone or in combination with DRZ against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, 80 adult male mice were randomly divided into 8 groups to receive the following treatments via intraperitoneal injection: saline dailym HNG (5 mg/kg) daily, DRZ (60 mg/kg) weekly, Dox (3 mg/kg) weekly, DRZ + HNG, Dox + HNG, Dox + DRZ, and Dox + HNG + DRZ. Echocardiograms were performed before and at 4, 8, and 9.5 wk after the beginning of treatment. All mice were euthanized at 10 wk. In the absence of Dox, HNG, DRZ, or DRZ + HNG had no adverse effect on the heart. Dox treatment caused decreases in ejection fraction and cardiac mass and increases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and intracardiac fibrosis. HNG or DRZ alone blunted the Dox-induced decrease in left ventricle posterior wall thickness and modestly ameliorated the Dox-induced decrease in ejection fraction. HNG + DRZ significantly ameliorated Dox-induced decreases in ejection function, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac mass. Using a targeted analysis for the mitochondrial gene array and protein expression in heart tissues, we demonstrated that HNG + DRZ reversed DOX-induced altered transcripts that were biomarkers of cardiac damage and uncoupling protein-2. We conclude that HNG enhances the cardiac protective effect of DRZ against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. HNG + DRZ protects mitochondria from Dox-induced cardiac damage and blunts the onset of cardiac dysfunction. Thus, HNG may be an adjuvant to DRZ in preventing Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Doxorubicin (Dox) is commonly used for treating a wide range of human cancers. However, cumulative dosage-dependent carditoxicity often limits its clinical applications. We demonstrated in this study that treating young adult male mice with synthetic humanin analog enhanced the cardiac protective effect of dexrazoxane against chemotherapeutic agent Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction. Thus, humanin analog can potentially serve as an adjuvant to dexrazoxane in more effectively preventing Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Over the past decades, investigations on heart regeneration have revealed the regulating networks of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Recently, the research effort has been directed to non-cardiomyocytes for heart regeneration, including cardiac fibroblasts, epicardial cells, endothelial cells, stem/progenitor cells, and immune cells. Cardiac fibroblasts not only substantially influence the composition of extracellular matrix deposition which is vital for the function and proliferation of cardiomyocytes, but also directly convert into cardiomyocytes. The epicardium is functionally important since it is involved in the cardiac development and regeneration via epicardial-mesenchymal transformation.

This study tested if Rem can protect the heart from I/R injury by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through the maintenance of zinc (Zn) homeostasis.\nIsolated rat hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of regional ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Rem was given by 3 consecutive 5-minute infusions, and each infusion was followed by a 5-minute drug-free perfusion before ischemia. Total Zn concentrations in cardiac tissue, cardiac function, infarct size, and apoptosis were assessed. H9c2 cells were subjected to 6 hours of hypoxia and 2 hours of reoxygenation (hypoxia/reoxygenation [H/R]), and Rem was given for 30 minutes before hypoxia. Metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF1) overexpression plasmids were transfected into H9c2 cells 48 hours before hypoxia. Intracellular Zn level, cell viability, and mitochondrial injury parameters were evaluated. A Zn chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) or an ER stress activator thapsigargin was administrated during in vitro and ex vivo studies. The regulatory molecules related to Zn homeostasis and ER stress in cardiac tissue, and cardiomyocytes were analyzed by Western blotting.\nRem caused significant reversion of Zn loss from the heart (Rem + I/R versus I/R, 9.43 \u00b1 0.55 vs 7.53 \u00b1 1.18; P < .05) by suppressing the expression of MTF1 and Zn transporter 1 (ZnT1). The inhibited expression of ER stress markers after Rem preconditioning was abolished by TPEN. Rem preconditioning improved the cardiac function accompanied by the reduction of infarct size (Rem + I/R versus I/R, 21% \u00b1 4% vs 40% \u00b1 6%; P < .05). The protective effects of Rem could be reserved by TPEN and thapsigargin. Similar effects were observed in H9c2 cells exposed to H/R. In addition, MTF1 overexpression blocked the inhibitory effects of Rem on ZnT1 expression and ER stress at reoxygenation. Rem attenuated the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by inhibiting ER stress via cardiac Zn restoration (Rem + H/R versus H/R, 79.57% \u00b1 10.62% vs 58.27% \u00b1 4.32%; P < .05).\nRem maintains Zn homeostasis at reperfusion by inhibiting MTF1 and ZnT1 expression, leading to the attenuation of ER stress and cardiac injury.

As the use of cryoablation increases, the need for new devices and procedures has emerged. This has been driven by technological limitations including lengthy periods to generate a single lesion (3-5 min), uncertain transmurality, and differential efficacy. Furthermore, due to limited ablation capacity under high heat loads, cryo has had limited success in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. To this end, in this study we evaluated a new cryoablation catheter, \nPerformance assessment included calorimetry, freeze zone isothermal distribution characterization and catheter ablation capacity in a submerged, circulating, heat-loaded ex vivo tissue model.

Conversely, increased interleukin (IL)-10 serum concentrations have been associated with asymptomatic CD. Cytokines and cytokine-related gene polymorphisms may control cytokine expression and have been proposed to contribute to CCC outcomes.\nWe evaluated the association of 13 cytokine-related genes (TGFB: rs8179181, rs8105161, rs1800469; IL10: rs1800890, rs1800871, rs1800896; IFNG: rs2430561; TNF: rs1800629; BAT1: rs3853601; LTA: rs909253, rs2239704; TNFR1: rs767455; TNFR2: rs1061624) with risk and progression of CCC.\nFour hundred and six seropositive patients from CD endemic areas in the state of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil, were classified as non-cardiopathic (A, 110) or cardiopathic (mild, B1, 163; severe, C, 133).

Next,\u00a0we demonstrate that a mesh-based sleeve coupled to the myocardium improves function in an acute porcine heart failure model. Then, we analyze the biological integration of global interface material candidates (medical mesh and silicone) in a healthy and infarcted murine model and show that a mesh interface yields superior mechanical coupling via pull-off force, histology, and microcomputed tomography. These results can inform the design of a therapeutic approach where a mesh-based soft robotic DCC is implanted, allowed to biologically integrate with the epicardium, and actuated for active assistance at a later timepoint.

The objective of the current study was to examine the protective role of metformin and its effect on autophagy in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Sprague\u207bDawley rats were divided into four groups at random. The doxorubicin-treated group received doxorubicin (3 mg/kg every second day) intraperitoneally. The metformin-treated group received 250 mg/kg/day metformin via gavage. The doxorubicin + metformin-treated group received both at the above-mentioned doses. The control group received vehicle only. Following the two-week treatment, the hearts were isolated, and cardiac functions were registered. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase iso-enzyme MB (CK-MB) enzyme, Troponin T, and cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA) were also measured. Heart tissue samples were histopathologically examined by using Masson's trichrome staining and Western blot analysis was conducted for evaluating the expression level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagy-associated proteins beclin-1, LC3B-II, and p62, respectively. The results revealed that treatment with metformin conferred increased cardiac protection against the development of cardiotoxicity manifested by a significant decrease in serum Troponin T and cardiac MDA levels, and remarkable improvement in heart function in connection with histopathological features. Furthermore, by focusing on the contribution of autophagic proteins, it was found that metformin normalised autophagy, which may help cardiomyocytes survive doxorubicin-induced toxicity.

{"title": "The Isolation and Culture of Primary Epicardial Cells Derived from Human Adult and Fetal Heart Specimens.", "abstract": "The epicardium, an epithelial cell layer covering the myocardium, has an essential role during cardiac development, as well as in the repair response of the heart after ischemic injury. When activated, epicardial cells undergo a process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to provide cells to the regenerating myocardium. Furthermore, the epicardium contributes via secretion of essential paracrine factors. To fully appreciate the regenerative potential of the epicardium, a human cell model is required. Here we outline a novel cell culture model to derive primary epicardial derived cells (EPDCs) from human adult and fetal cardiac tissue. To isolate EPDCs, the epicardium is dissected from the outside of the heart specimen and processed into a single cell suspension.

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the R9C PLN mutation at its endogenous locus into a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line from an individual with no cardiovascular disease. R9C PLN hiPSC-CMs display a blunted \u03b2-agonist response and defective calcium handling. In 3D human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs), a blunted lusitropic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation was observed with R9C PLN. hiPSC-CMs harboring the R9C PLN mutation showed activation of a hypertrophic phenotype, as evidenced by expression of hypertrophic markers and increased cell size and capacitance of cardiomyocytes. RNA-seq suggests that R9C PLN results in an altered metabolic state and profibrotic signaling, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis and picrosirius staining of R9C PLN hECTs. The expression of several miRNAs involved in fibrosis, hypertrophy, and cardiac metabolism were also perturbed in R9C PLN hiPSC-CMs. This study contributes to better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of the hereditary R9C PLN mutation in the context of human cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-05-13", "authors": ["Delaine KCeholski", "Irene CTurnbull", "Chi-WingKong", "SimonKoplev", "JoshuaMayourian", "Przemek AGorski", "FrancescaStillitano", "Angelos ASkodras", "MathieuNonnenmacher", "NinetteCohen", "Johan L MBj\u00f6rkegren", "Daniel RStroik", "Razvan LCornea", "David DThomas", "Ronald ALi", "Kevin DCosta", "Roger JHajjar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.05.007"}

Thus, the development of a new bio-inspired system is required, that retain the advantageous effect of doxorubicin while retarding the side effects. Hence, a system was developed that we describe 'doxorubicin-DNA adduct entrenched artificial virus encased in polypeptide complex'. The drug-DNA adduct (DDA) was prepared by a formaldehyde mediated reaction. A simple chloroform extraction method for the separation of DDA was developed. DDA was employed to self-assemble the folate tethered bovine serum albumin to form the protein coat in the proposed artificial virus. The folate tethered albumin provides an artificial virus concept, with tumor tissue targeting due to the presence of folate. The whole system was then encased in a pH-responsive polypeptide complex that dissolves in acidic pH, but not in basic pH. DDA was evaluated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A promising drug release at physiological condition was observed from DDA. The developed system was evaluated by a developed and validated artificial cell apparatus that mimic the features of a cancer cell. The drug delivery system displayed a considerable amount of drug release within 24\u202fh. Moreover, the developed artificial virus system reduced angiogenesis caused by tumor cells in chick chorioallantoic membrane. Histopathology of treated chicken heart slices demonstrated that the developed artificial virus system reduces the tissue deformation and apoptosis in heart tissue slices, thus providing a new approach to prevent Dox-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

As a pro-survival pathway, the heat shock response (HSR) protects healthy cells from stressors. However, it is unclear whether the HSR plays a role in transport stress-induced heart damage. To evaluate the effects of transport stress on heart damage and HSR protection, newly hatched chicks were treated with transport stress for 2\u00a0h, 4\u00a0h and 8\u00a0h. Transport stress caused decreases in body weight and increases in serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, nitric oxide (NO) content in heart tissue, cardiac nitric oxide syntheses (NOS) activity and NOS isoforms transcription. The mRNA expression of heat shock factors (HSFs, including HSF1-3) and heat shock proteins (HSPs, including HSP25, HSP40, HSP47, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110) in the heart of 2\u00a0h transport-treated chicks was upregulated. After 8\u00a0h of transport stress in chicks, the transcription levels of the same HSPs and HSF2 were reduced in the heart. It was also found that the changes in the HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 protein levels had similar tendencies. These results suggested that transport stress augmented NO generation through enhancing the activity of NOS and the transcription of NOS isoforms. Therefore, this study provides new evidence that transport stress induces heart damage in the newly hatched chicks by blocking the cytoprotective HSR and augmenting NO production.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2018-05-12", "authors": ["FSun", "Y-ZZuo", "JGe", "JXia", "X-NLi", "JLin", "CZhang", "H-LXu", "J-LLi"], "doi": "10.3382/ps/pey146"}

Serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and myocardial enzyme activities including creatine kinase-isoenzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined biochemically, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-test had been used to determine relative of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene expressions in the heart tissue of rats. Structure of rat's heart tissue was examined by histopathological analysis (H&E).\nAGE increased the body weight and insulin concentration, while, it decreased serum glucose concentration, CK-MB, and LDH enzyme activities in comparing with the diabetic group. In addition, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and AST didn't show any significant changes in serum values of AGE compared to diabetic rats. Nano-curcumin suspension decreased the serum levels of triglycerides, CK- MB, LDH, and AST. While, there were non-significant changes in the body weight, glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol level of the same group compared with the STZ- untreated induced diabetic rats.

Aside from respiratory depression, methadone is known to cause QT-prolongation, which may lead to sudden cardiac death. Concentrations in heart tissue should be more accurate for estimating cardiotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the effect of methadone on the QT-interval could be simulated and whether the concentrations in heart tissues allowed for better prediction of the Bazett corrected QT-interval (QTcB). A predictive performance study was conducted using the simulation platform Cardiac Safety Simulator to mimic five literature studies using their described study conditions. Both free and total plasma and heart concentrations were investigated using two different in silico models: the O'Hara-Rudy (ORD) model and the 10 Tusscher (TNNP) model. The results showed that the QTcB of methadone was best predicted either with total plasma using the TNNP model or with free plasma using the ORD model. The ORD model was highly sensitive to the total heart concentrations, resulting in overprediction of the QTcB. The TNNP model also overpredicted the QTcB, but to a lesser degree than the ORD model. Furthermore, due to a low baseline QTcB, the ORD model underpredicted the QTcB for both the free plasma and free heart concentrations. In conclusion, it is possible to simulate the cardiac effects of methadone, yet several elements influence the approach uncertainty including but not limited to biophysically details model of cardiac electrophysiology, exposure data, and input parameters.", "journal": "Toxicology mechanisms and methods", "date": "2018-05-12", "authors": ["Christian ReussMikkelsen", "Jakob RossJornil", "Ljubica VukelicAndersen", "J\u00f8rgen BoHasselstr\u00f8m", "SebastianPolak"], "doi": "10.1080/15376516.2018.1475537"}

We evaluated isogenic genome-edited human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM) for their validity to model, and add clarity to, HCM.\nCRISPR/Cas9 editing produced 11 variants of the HCM-causing mutation c.C9123T-MYH7 [(p.R453C-\u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MHC)] in 3 independent hPSC lines. Isogenic sets were differentiated to hPSC-CMs for high-throughput, non-subjective molecular and functional assessment using 12 approaches in 2D monolayers and/or 3D engineered heart tissues. Although immature, edited hPSC-CMs exhibited the main hallmarks of HCM (hypertrophy, multi-nucleation, hypertrophic marker expression, sarcomeric disarray). Functional evaluation supported the energy depletion model due to higher metabolic respiration activity, accompanied by abnormalities in calcium handling, arrhythmias, and contraction force. Partial phenotypic rescue was achieved with ranolazine but not omecamtiv mecarbil, while RNAseq highlighted potentially novel molecular targets.\nOur holistic and comprehensive approach showed that energy depletion affected core cardiomyocyte functionality. The engineered R453C-\u03b2MHC-mutation triggered compensatory responses in hPSC-CMs, causing increased ATP production and \u03b1MHC to energy-efficient \u03b2MHC switching. We showed that pharmacological rescue of arrhythmias was possible, while MHY7: MYH6 and mutant: wild-type MYH7 ratios may be diagnostic, and previously undescribed lncRNAs and gene modifiers are suggestive of new mechanisms.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2018-05-10", "authors": ["DiogoMosqueira", "IngraMannhardt", "Jamie RBhagwan", "KatarzynaLis-Slimak", "PuspitaKatili", "ElizabethScott", "MustafaHassan", "MaksymilianProndzynski", "Stephen CHarmer", "AndrewTinker", "James G WSmith", "LucieCarrier", "Philip MWilliams", "DanielGaffney", "ThomasEschenhagen", "ArneHansen", "ChrisDenning"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehy249"}

A prerequisite for clinical trials and translational implementation of hPSC-derived CMs is the ability to manufacture safe and potent cells on the scale needed to replace cells lost during heart disease. Current differentiation protocols generate fetal-like CMs that exhibit proarrhythmogenic potential. Sufficient maturation of these hPSC-derived CMs has yet to be achieved to allow these cells to be used as a regenerative medicine therapy.

Despite intense effort in the last 10 years, most CHDs (~70%) still have an unknown etiology. Conotruncal based defects, such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a common complex of devastating heart defects, typically requires surgical intervention in the first year of life. We reported that the noncoding transcriptome in myocardial tissue from children with TOF is characterized by significant variation in levels of expression of noncoding RNAs, and more specifically, a significant reduction in 12 small cajal body-associated RNAs (scaRNAs) in the right ventricle. scaRNAs are essential for the biochemical modification and maturation of small nuclear RNAs (spliceosomal RNAs), which in turn are critical components of the spliceosome. This is particularly important because we also documented that splicing of mRNAs that are critical for heart development was dysregulated in the heart tissue of infants with TOF. Furthermore, we went on to show, using the zebrafish model, that altering the expression of these same scaRNAs led to faulty mRNA processing and heart defects in the developing embryo.

{"title": "The local microenvironment limits the regenerative potential of the mouse neonatal heart.", "abstract": "Neonatal mice have been shown to regenerate their hearts during a transient window of time of approximately 1 week after birth. However, experimental evidence for this phenomenon is not undisputed, because several laboratories have been unable to detect neonatal heart regeneration. We first confirmed that 1-day-old neonatal mice are indeed able to mount a robust regenerative response after heart amputation. We then found that this regenerative ability sharply declines within 48 hours, with hearts of 2-day-old mice responding to amputation with fibrosis, rather than regeneration. By comparing the global transcriptomes of 1- and 2-day-old mouse hearts, we found that most differentially expressed transcripts encode extracellular matrix components and structural constituents of the cytoskeleton. These results suggest that the stiffness of the local microenvironment, rather than cardiac cell-autonomous mechanisms, crucially determines the ability or inability of the heart to regenerate. Testing this hypothesis by pharmacologically decreasing the stiffness of the extracellular matrix in 3-day-old mice, we found that decreased matrix stiffness rescued the ability of mice to regenerate heart tissue after apical resection. Together, our results identify an unexpectedly restricted time window of regenerative competence in the mouse neonatal heart and open new avenues for promoting cardiac regeneration by local modification of the extracellular matrix stiffness.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2018-05-08", "authors": ["MarioNotari", "AntoniVentura-Rubio", "Sylvia JBedford-Guaus", "IgnasiJorba", "LolaMulero", "DanielNavajas", "Merc\u00e8Mart\u00ed", "\u00c1ngelRaya"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.aao5553"}

This study aimed to investigate the change of autophagy in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced myocardium dysfunction and its relationship with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.\nTotally, 12 rats were randomly divided into CLP group or sham-operated (SHAM) group. Cardiac tissues were harvested 18 h after CLP or sham operation. Pathology was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining, cardiac functions by echocardiography, distribution of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 type II (LC3II) by immunohistochemical staining, and autophagic vacuoles by transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR), phosphorylation of S6 kinase-1 (PS6K1), and LC3II and p62 expression were measured by western blotting. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation of two parameters.\nThe results by pathology and echocardiography revealed that there was obvious myocardial injury in CLP rats (left ventricle ejection fraction: SHAM 0.76 \u00b1 0.06 vs. CLP 0.59 \u00b1 0.11, P < 0.01; fractional shortening: SHAM 0.51 \u00b1 0.09 vs. CLP 0.37 \u00b1 0.06, P < 0.05).

We developed two engineered cardiac grafts, based on decellularized scaffolds from myocardial and pericardial tissues and repopulated them with adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs). The structure, macromechanical and micromechanical scaffold properties were preserved upon the decellularization and recellularization processes, except for recellularized myocardium micromechanics that was \u223c2-fold stiffer than native tissue and decellularized scaffolds. Proteome characterization of the two acellular matrices showed enrichment of matrisome proteins and major cardiac extracellular matrix components, considerably higher for the recellularized pericardium. Moreover, the pericardial scaffold demonstrated better cell penetrance and retention, as well as a bigger pore size. Both engineered cardiac grafts were further evaluated in pre-clinical MI swine models. Forty days after graft implantation, swine treated with the engineered cardiac grafts showed significant ventricular function recovery. Irrespective of the scaffold origin or cell recolonization, all scaffolds integrated with the underlying myocardium and showed signs of neovascularization and nerve sprouting.

{"title": "Hypoglycemic Effects in Alloxan-Induced Diabetic Rats of the Phenolic Extract from Mongolian Oak Cups Enriched in Ellagic Acid, Kaempferol and Their Derivatives.", "abstract": "Our previous reports showed that crude extract prepared with 50% ethanol (ethanol crude extract, ECE) from Mongolian oak cups possessed excellent in vitro antioxidant capacities as well as inhibitory activities against \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase and protein glycation caused by its enrichment in phenolics, including mainly ellagic acid, kaempferol and their derivatives. Nevertheless, few in vivo studies on antidiabetic activities of these phenolics were conducted. The present study investigated hypoglycemic effects with normal and diabetic rats being administrated orally without or with ECE at 200 and 800 mg/kg for 15 days. In normal rats, no significant differences were exhibited after ECE administration in body weight, fasting blood glucose level, levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and AST in serum, organ indexes, and levels of GSH and MDA in organs. In diabetic rats, the fasting blood glucose level, indexes of heart and liver, and levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in serum and MDA in heart tissue were significantly decreased. Moreover, HDL levels in serum and SOD activities in the four organs of diabetic rats were significantly improved after ECE administration at 800 mg/kg. Thus, in addition to inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase and protein glycation reported previously, oak cups might contain novel dietary phytonutrients in preventing abnormal changes in blood glucose and lipid profile and attenuating oxidant stress in vivo. The results also implied that it is ellagic acid, kaempferol and their derivatives enriched in ECE that might play vital roles in managing type 1 as well as type 2 diabetes.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2018-05-02", "authors": ["PeipeiYin", "YuWang", "LingguangYang", "JinlingSui", "YujunLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules23051046\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2017.10.002\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.019\n10.1039/C7FO01823A\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.11.052\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.09.037\n10.3390/molecules16119764\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.10.029\n10.1016/S0024-3205(03)00662-3\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.08.020\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.11.001\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.03.011\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.028\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2016.09.018\n10.1016/j.biopha.2017.07.117\n10.1016/j.bcdf.2016.05.001\n10.1007/BF00253493\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.067\n10.1016/S2221-6189(13)60126-2\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.001\n10.1016/j.jff.2017.05.001\n10.1016/j.fct.2017.03.056\n10.1016/j.sajb.2018.02.397\n10.2337/diab.46.11.1733\n10.1016/j.lwt.2014.04.007\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.217\n10.2174/1573406413666170307163929\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.02.017\n10.1039/C4FO00844H\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.01.015\n10.1016/j.jff.2017.06.021\n10.1016/j.intimp.2015.07.018\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.12.028\n10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.019\n10.1007/s00246-013-0693-5\n10.1186/s12944-017-0431-8\n10.1016/j.jff.2017.09.033\n10.1016/S1357-2725(03)00142-0\n10.1292/jvms.55.991\n10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.040\n10.1016/j.jep.2004.12.033\n10.1016/S0928-4680(99)00013-9\n10.1039/C7RA01548H\n10.1016/S0024-3205(03)00543-5\n10.1002/biof.552210161"}

Cardiac fibrosis plays a critical role in sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms of the activation of cardiac fibrosis is unclarified. In this study, we found that microRNA-23b (miR-23b) was up-regulated in heart tissue during cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and transfection of miR-23b inhibitor improved survival in late sepsis. Inhibition of miR-23b in the myocardium protected against cardiac output and enhanced left ventricular systolic function. miR-23b inhibitor also alleviated cardiac fibrosis in late sepsis. MiR-23b mediates the activation of TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling to promote the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts through suppression of 5'TG3'-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1). MiR-23b also induces AKT/N-Cadherin signaling to contribute to the deposition of extracellular matrix by inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). TGIF1 and PTEN were confirmed as the targets of miR-23b in vitro by Dual-Glo Luciferase assay. miR-23b inhibitor blocked the activation of adhesive molecules and restored the imbalance of pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic factors. These data provide direct evidence that miR-23b is a critical contributor to the activation of cardiac fibrosis to mediate the development of myocardial dysfunction in late sepsis.

{"title": "Upregulation of the aging related LMNA splice variant progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6-8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.\nmRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 \u00b1 0.42 vs. 0.81 \u00b1 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells.\nOur data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-04-28", "authors": ["MoritzMessner", "Santhosh KumarGhadge", "ValentinaGoetsch", "AndreasWimmer", "JakobD\u00f6rler", "GerhardP\u00f6lzl", "Marc-MichaelZaruba"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0196739\n10.1136/hrt.2003.025270\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.06.038\n10.1126/science.1084125\n10.1126/science.1127168\n10.1016/j.ceb.2014.03.003\n10.1056/NEJM199912023412302\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.11.011\n10.5603/CJ.a2014.0037\n10.1194/jlr.R500011-JLR200\n10.1007/s10038-003-0025-3\n10.1038/nature01629\n10.1073/pnas.0402943101\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034115\n10.1101/gad.255968.114\n10.1007/s00418-016-1411-1\n10.1002/ajmg.a.31346\n10.1056/NEJMoa0706898\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209460\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001269\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw128\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp249\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.902056\n10.1080/19491034.2016.1260798\n10.1016/j.ahj.2008.01.026\n10.1096/fj.201700014R\n10.1093/hmg/ddq158\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1111/acel.12433\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002346\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003802\n10.1172/JCI85908"}
{"title": "Multifunctional 3D electrode platform for real-time in situ monitoring and stimulation of cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death around the world underlining the importance of efficient treatments including novel medication. In vitro models of cardiac tissues are highly desired for monitoring electrophysiological response to screen pharmaceutical compounds at an early stage. Here, we report a platinum based 3D pillar electrode platform with cell growth guiding channel, which allows integrated, continuous electrical stimulation and recording of the cardiac tissues. This platform was successfully used to culture beating cardiomyocytes over weeks. The Pt-PDMS pillar electrode showed an impedance of 2.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202fk\u03a9 at 10\u202fHz that is stable for using in cell cultures at 37\u202f\u00b0C. Electrically pacing the cells improved maturation of the cardiac tissues. Contraction activities of 3D cardiac tissues were monitored in real-time through the pillar electrodes to evaluate physiological parameters. Adding 100\u202fnM Isoproterenol clearly increased the spontaneous beating rate and decreased the extracellular field potential duration of the microtissues observed with electrical recording through the pillar electrodes. Overall, this platform has a potential to be applied in drug screening for in situ monitoring the biophysical parameters of the heart tissue in real-time.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2018-04-28", "authors": ["NingZhang", "FlurinStauffer", "Benjamin RSimona", "FengZhang", "Zhao-MingZhang", "Ning-PingHuang", "J\u00e1nosV\u00f6r\u00f6s"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2018.04.037"}
{"title": "Quantitative myocardial perfusion from static cardiac and dynamic arterial CT.", "abstract": "Quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) estimation by dynamic contrast enhanced cardiac computed tomography (CT) requires multi-frame acquisition of contrast transit through the blood pool and myocardium to inform the arterial input and tissue response functions. Both the input and the tissue response functions for the entire myocardium are sampled with each acquisition. However, the long breath holds and frequent sampling can result in significant motion artifacts and relatively high radiation dose. To address these limitations, we propose and evaluate a new static cardiac and dynamic arterial (SCDA) quantitative MBF approach where (1) the input function is well sampled using either prediction from pre-scan timing bolus data or measured from dynamic thin slice 'bolus tracking' acquisitions, and (2) the whole-heart tissue response data is limited to one contrast enhanced CT acquisition. A perfusion model uses the dynamic arterial input function to generate a family of possible myocardial contrast enhancement curves corresponding to a range of MBF values. Combined with the timing of the single whole-heart acquisition, these curves generate a lookup table relating myocardial contrast enhancement to quantitative MBF. We tested the SCDA approach in 28 patients that underwent a full dynamic CT protocol both at rest and vasodilator stress conditions. Using measured input function plus single (enhanced CT only) or plus double (enhanced and contrast free baseline CT's) myocardial acquisitions yielded MBF estimates with root mean square (RMS) error of 1.2\u2009ml/min/g and 0.35\u2009ml/min/g, and radiation dose reductions of 90% and 83%, respectively. The prediction of the input function based on timing bolus data and the static acquisition had an RMS error compared to the measured input function of 26.0% which led to MBF estimation errors greater than threefold higher than using the measured input function. SCDA presents a new, simplified approach for quantitative perfusion imaging with an acquisition strategy offering substantial radiation dose and computational complexity savings over dynamic CT.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2018-04-28", "authors": ["MichaelBindschadler", "Kelley RBranch", "Adam MAlessio"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/aac0bd"}

Regenerative therapy has been applied to restore lost cardiac muscle and cardiac performance. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can provide an unlimited source of cardiomyocytes and therefore play a key role in cardiac regeneration. Despite initial encouraging results from pre-clinical studies, progress toward clinical applications has been hampered by issues such as tumorigenesis, arrhythmogenesis, immune rejection, scalability, low graft-cell survival, and poor engraftment.

{"title": "Newt cells secrete extracellular vesicles with therapeutic bioactivity in mammalian cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Newts can regenerate amputated limbs and cardiac tissue, unlike mammals which lack broad regenerative capacity. Several signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival during newt tissue regeneration have been elucidated, however the factors that coordinate signaling between cells, as well as the conservation of these factors in other animals, are not well defined. Here we report that media conditioned by newt limb explant cells (A1 cells) protect mammalian cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of A1-conditioned media was negated by exposing A1 cells to GW4869, which suppresses the generation of extracellular vesicles (EVs). A1-EVs are similar in diameter (~100-150 nm), structure, and share several membrane surface and cargo proteins with mammalian exosomes. However, isolated A1-EVs contain significantly higher levels of both RNA and protein per particle than mammalian EVs. Additionally, numerous cargo RNAs and proteins are unique to A1-EVs. Of particular note, A1-EVs contain numerous mRNAs encoding nuclear receptors, membrane ligands, as well as transcription factors. Mammalian cardiomyocytes treated with A1-EVs showed increased expression of genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway, a pivotal player in survival signaling. We conclude that newt cells secrete EVs with diverse, distinctive RNA and protein contents. Despite ~300 million years of evolutionary divergence between newts and mammals, newt EVs confer cytoprotective effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Journal of extracellular vesicles", "date": "2018-04-27", "authors": ["Ryan CMiddleton", "Russell GRogers", "GeoffreyDe Couto", "EleniTseliou", "KristinLuther", "RonaldHolewinski", "DanielSoetkamp", "Jennifer EVan Eyk", "Travis JAntes", "EduardoMarb\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1080/20013078.2018.1456888"}

{"title": "Cardiac Restoration Stemming From the Placenta Tree: Insights From Fetal and Perinatal Cell Biology.", "abstract": "Efficient cardiac repair and ultimate regeneration still represents one of the main challenges of modern medicine. Indeed, cardiovascular disease can derive from independent conditions upsetting heart structure and performance: myocardial ischemia and infarction (MI), pharmacological cardiotoxicity, and congenital heart defects, just to name a few. All these disorders have profound consequences on cardiac tissue, inducing the onset of heart failure over time. Since the cure is currently represented by heart transplantation, which is extremely difficult due to the shortage of donors, much effort is being dedicated to developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on stem cell exploitation. Among the broad scenario of stem/progenitor cell subpopulations, fetal and perinatal sources, namely amniotic fluid and term placenta, have gained interest due to their peculiar regenerative capacity, high self-renewal capability, and ease of collection from clinical waste material.

{"title": "Evaluating the potential of housekeeping genes, rRNAs, snRNAs, microRNAs and circRNAs as reference genes for the estimation of PMI.", "abstract": "The precise estimation of postmortem interval (PMI) is a critical step in death investigation of forensic cases. Detecting the degradation of RNA in tissues by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology provides a new theoretical basis for estimation of PMI. However, most commonly used reference genes degrade over time, while previous studies seldom consider this when selecting suitable reference genes for the estimation of PMI. Studies have shown microRNAs (miRNAs) are very stable and circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently emerged as a novel class of RNAs with high stability. We aimed to evaluate the stability of the two kinds of RNAs and normal reference genes using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms to identify tissue-specific reference genes for PMI estimation. The content of candidate RNAs from mouse heart, liver and skeletal muscle tissues were dynamically examined in 8 consecutive days after death. Among the 11 candidate genes (\u03b2-actin, Gapdh, Rps18, 5S, 18S, U6, miR-133a, miR-122, circ-AFF1, LC-Ogdh and LC-LRP6), the following genes showed prioritized stability: miR-122, miR-133a and 18S in heart tissues; LC-Ogdh, circ-AFF1 and miR-122 in liver tissues; and miR-133a, circ-AFF1 and LC-LRP6 in skeletal muscle tissues.

We sequenced a total of 64 RNA samples and quantified the effect of RNA degradation, DNA contamination, and other confounding factors on the sncRNA-seq data. Besides microRNAs, other noncoding RNA species (piRNAs, tRNAs, snoRNAs, rRNAs) were investigated.\nConsistent with previous results, we found that the tissue specificity of microRNAs is generally well preserved. The distribution of microRNA isoforms was similar to the distribution of canonical forms. New miRNAs were more frequently discovered in degraded samples. sncRNA Reads generated from degraded samples mapped frequently to piRNAs, tRNAs, snoRNAs, or scaRNAs. Sequencing reads that were depleted of sncRNAs showed an increased mapping frequency to bacterial species.\nOur data emphasize the importance of sample integrity, especially for next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based high-throughput sncRNA profiles.

{"title": "Cardiac Progenitor Cells: The Matrix Has You.", "abstract": "Components of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) are synthesized by residing cells and are continuously remodeled by them. Conversely, residing cells (including primitive cells) receive constant biochemical and mechanical signals from the ECM that modulate their biology. The pathological progression of heart failure affects all residing cells, inevitably causing profound changes in ECM composition and architecture that, in turn, impact on cell phenotypes. Any regenerative medicine approach must aim at sustaining microenvironment conditions that favor cardiogenic commitment of therapeutic cells and minimize pro-fibrotic signals, while conversely boosting the capacity of therapeutic cells to counteract adverse remodeling of the ECM. In this Perspective article, we discuss multiple issues about the features of an optimal scaffold for supporting cardiac tissue engineering strategies with cardiac progenitor cells, and, conversely, about the possible antifibrotic mechanisms induced by cell therapy.

{"title": "Epigenetics of Aberrant Cardiac Wound Healing.", "abstract": "Remodeling of cardiac tissue architecture is essential for normal organ development and maintaining homeostasis after injury. Injurious insults to the heart, such as hypertension and myocardial infarction, promote cellular responses including stimulation of resident inflammatory cells, activation of endothelial cells and recruitment of immune cells, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, and activation of fibroblasts. The physiological goal of this coordinated cellular response is to repair damaged tissue while maintaining or restoring cardiac contractile function. Persistent uncontrolled inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in the heart due to hyperactive wound healing are detrimental and impair cardiac performance, facilitating the progression to heart failure. Abnormal changes in gene expression promote acquisition of aberrant cellular phenotypes that drive cardiac remodeling. DNA methylation and histone modifications are epigenetic mechanisms that critically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression, and are essential for normal physiology and development. Increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that these epigenetic mechanisms are involved in driving aberrant wound healing and the development of heart failure. While most of our knowledge to date is on the heart as a whole, the precise contribution of DNA methylation and histone modifications in regulating aberrant cardiac remodeling at the cellular level is less defined. Therefore, this overview aims to summarize the role of DNA methylation and histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) in heart failure and to comprehensively dissect the role these mechanisms play in regulating the function of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells in response to injury. \u00a9 2018 American Physiological Society.

In order to evaluate this organization in heart transplant (HTX) recipients, 58 nocturnal Holter signals of 14 HTX patients were analyzed. Their dynamical properties were evaluated by short-term HRV indices and measures grounded on entropy. Estimates grouped according to the patients' clinical progress: free of complications versus with complications, and arranged in order of the length of time since the HTX, lead us to the conclusion that higher HRV is associated with a worse outcome for HTX patients. Moreover, short-term HRV indices that are constant, rather than increasing over time, serve well in the prognosis of the future state of a HTX patient. These findings suggest that increases observed in HRV indices are related to erratic rhythms resulting from remodeling of the cardiac tissue (including heterogeneous innervation) in long-term HTX patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that dynamical landscape markers (entropy and fragmentation measures together with the short-term HRV indices) can serve as a tool in the exploration of the genesis of (non-respiratory sinus) arrhythmia.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2018-04-25", "authors": ["JoannaWdowczyk", "DanutaMakowiec", "MarcinGrucha\u0142a", "DorotaWejer", "Zbigniew RStruzik"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.00274\n10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.06.44\n10.1113/expphysiol.2007.041178\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004070\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.07.009\n10.1186/cc3045\n10.1023/A:1009902022073\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00086\n10.1063/1.4917289\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.115.003507\n10.5603/CJ.2013.0031\n10.3389/fnins.2014.00402\n10.1007/s10554-016-0937-6\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2011.12.002\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00255\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.1.84\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.056259\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw604\n10.15420/aer.2014.3.3.149\n10.1016/j.physrep.2006.12.004\n10.1016/S0167-2789(02)00432-3\n10.1088/1361-6579/aa6782\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)90795-8\n10.1111/j.1542-474X.2005.10101.x\n10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00213\n10.1016/j.healun.2017.07.019\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00201\n10.3390/e17031253\n10.5506/APhysPolB.44.1219\n10.5506/APhysPolB.45.1771\n10.1016/j.chaos.2016.03.024\n10.1136/heart.88.4.378\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2012.03335.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.15.1510\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.4.393\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1996.tb03286.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1996.tb03241.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.6.H2039\n10.1093/europace/euv015\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.461\n10.1093/sleep/33.7.943\n10.1093/ageing/afn292\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2007.11.005\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.6.547\n10.1161/JAHA.112.001461\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.09.543\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00294\n10.1088/0967-3334/32/6/008\n10.1016/S0735-1097(97)00554-8\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04046.x\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00079"}
{"title": "Oxygen Consumption of the Aerobically-Perfused Cardioplegic Donor Heart at Different Temperatures.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the oxygen consumption of explanted aerobically-perfused cardioplegic porcine hearts at different temperatures.

The perfusate consisted of an albumin-containing hyperoncotic cardioplegic nutrition solution with erythrocytes to a hematocrit of 10%. Five temperatures were studied: 37, 30, 22, 15, and 8\u00b0C. When the erythrocytes in the perfusate were fully saturated, the oxygenator was excluded from the circuit and blood gases were analyzed periodically until the erythrocytes had desaturated to less than 20%. Between 80% and 60% saturation the desaturation curves were linear in all groups and the oxygen consumption was calculated from this part of the curves. RESULTS The weight of the hearts was 208\u00b14 g (mean \u00b1SEM, n=30). The oxygen consumption in mL/min/100 g heart tissue was (mean \u00b1SEM, n=6 in each group) 37\u00b0C: 1.10\u00b10.04; 30\u00b0C: 0.58\u00b10.02; 22\u00b0C: 0.33\u00b10.01; 15\u00b0C: 0.21\u00b10.01; and 8\u00b0C: 0.16\u00b10.02. CONCLUSIONS The oxygen consumption of the cardioplegic perfused pig heart at normothermia was 1.1 mL/min/100 g and was reduced by 85% to 0.16 mL/min/100 g at 8\u00b0C.", "journal": "Annals of transplantation", "date": "2018-04-25", "authors": ["GuangqiQin", "YangSu", "TrygveSj\u00f6berg", "StigSteen"], "doi": "10.12659/AOT.907753"}

This review focuses on these conductive polymers for tissue engineering applications. Conductive polymers exhibit promising conductivity as bioactive scaffolds for tissue regeneration, and their conductive nature allows cells or tissue cultured on them to be stimulated by electrical signals. However, their mechanical brittleness and poor processability restrict their application. Therefore, conductive polymeric composites based on conductive polymers and biocompatible biodegradable polymers (natural or synthetic) were developed. The major objective of this review is to summarize the conductive biomaterials used in tissue engineering including conductive composite films, conductive nanofibers, conductive hydrogels, and conductive composite scaffolds fabricated by various methods such as electrospinning, coating, or deposition by in situ polymerization.

The electro-mechanical model of the cardiac tissue is composed of four coupled sub-models: (1) the static finite elasticity equations for the transversely isotropic deformation of the cardiac tissue; (2) the active tension model describing the dynamics of the intracellular calcium, cross-bridge binding and myofilament tension; (3) the anisotropic Bidomain model describing the evolution of the intra- and extra-cellular potentials in the deforming cardiac tissue; and (4) the ionic membrane model describing the dynamics of ionic currents, gating variables, ionic concentrations and stretch-activated channels. This strongly coupled electro-mechanical model is discretized in time with a splitting semi-implicit technique and in space with isoparametric finite elements. The resulting scalable parallel solver is based on Multilevel Additive Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the Bidomain system and on BDDC preconditioned Newton-Krylov solvers for the non-linear finite elasticity system.

We selected 2 case-only study designs, case-crossover and self-controlled case series, to analyze the data. The advantage of these methods is that confounding factors that do not vary with time are adjusted for implicitly. In the case-crossover design, a conditional logistic regression model with exposure to IDTs was used to estimate the risks of IE following an IDT with 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks delay, respectively. In the self-controlled case series design, a conditional Poisson regression model was used to estimate the risk of IE for the risk periods of 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 16 weeks following an IDT.\nIn total, 9120 and 8181 patients with IE were included in case-crossover design and self-controlled case series design, respectively.

Computational models of conduction in cardiac tissues require identification of parameters. Our knowledge on these parameters is limited, especially for diseased tissues. Here, we assessed and quantified parameters for computational modeling of conduction in cardiac tissues. We used a rabbit model of myocardial infarction (MI) and an imaging-based approach to derive the parameters. Left ventricular tissue samples were obtained from fixed control hearts (animals: 5) and infarcted hearts (animals: 6) within 200 \u03bcm (region 1), 250-750 \u03bcm (region 2) and 1,000-1,250 \u03bcm (region 3) of the MI border. We assessed extracellular space, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, nuclei and gap junctions by a multi-label staining protocol. With confocal microscopy we acquired three-dimensional (3D) image stacks with a voxel size of 200 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 200 nm. Image segmentation yielded 3D reconstructions of tissue microstructure, which were used to numerically derive extracellular conductivity tensors. Volume fractions of myocyte, extracellular, interlaminar cleft, vessel and fibroblast domains in control were (in %) 65.03 \u00b1 3.60, 24.68 \u00b1 3.05, 3.95 \u00b1 4.84, 7.71 \u00b1 2.15, and 2.48 \u00b1 1.11, respectively. Volume fractions in regions 1 and 2 were different for myocyte, myofibroblast, vessel, and extracellular domains.

{"title": "Rearrangement of the Protein Phosphatase 1 Interactome During Heart Failure Progression.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a complex disease with a rising prevalence despite advances in treatment. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) has long been implicated in HF pathogenesis, but its exact role is both unclear and controversial. Most previous studies measured only the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) without investigating its diverse set of interactors, which confer localization and substrate specificity to the holoenzyme. In this study, we define the PP1 interactome in cardiac tissue and test the hypothesis that this interactome becomes rearranged during HF progression at the level of specific PP1c interactors.\nMice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction and grouped on the basis of ejection fraction into sham, hypertrophy, moderate HF (ejection fraction, 30%-40%), and severe HF (ejection fraction <30%). Cardiac lysates were subjected to affinity purification with anti-PP1c antibodies followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. PP1 regulatory subunit 7 (Ppp1r7) was knocked down in mouse cardiomyocytes and HeLa cells with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 and siRNA, respectively. Calcium imaging was performed on isolated ventricular myocytes.\nSeventy-one and 98 PP1c interactors were quantified from mouse cardiac and HeLa lysates, respectively, including many novel interactors and protein complexes. This represents the largest reproducible PP1 interactome data set ever captured from any tissue, including both primary and secondary/tertiary interactors. Nine PP1c interactors with changes in their binding to PP1c were strongly associated with HF progression, including 2 known (Ppp1r7 and Ppp1r18) and 7 novel interactors. Within the entire cardiac PP1 interactome, Ppp1r7 had the highest binding to PP1c. Cardiac-specific knockdown in mice led to cardiac dysfunction and disruption of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\nPP1 is best studied at the level of its interactome, which undergoes significant rearrangement during HF progression. The 9 key interactors that are associated with HF progression may represent potential targets in HF therapy. In particular, Ppp1r7 may play a central role in regulating the PP1 interactome by acting as a competitive molecular \"sponge\" of PP1c.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2018-04-20", "authors": ["David YChiang", "Katherina MAlsina", "EleonoraCorradini", "MartinFitzpatrick", "LiNi", "Satadru KLahiri", "Julia OReynolds", "XiaoluPan", "LarryScott", "Albert J RHeck", "Xander H TWehrens"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034361\n10.1038/nrcardio.2016.25\n10.1074/mcp.M111.014068\n10.1074/mcp.M111.014050"}
{"title": "Adiponectin determines farnesoid X receptor agonism-mediated cardioprotection against post-infarction remodelling and dysfunction.", "abstract": "The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily that plays a critical regulatory role in cardiovascular physiology/pathology. However, the role of systemic FXR activation in the chronic phase in myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac remodelling and dysfunction remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of long-term FXR activation on post-MI cardiac remodelling and dysfunction.\nMice underwent either MI surgery or sham operation. At 1\u2009week after MI, both sham and MI mice were gavaged with 25\u2009mg/kg/d of a synthetic FXR agonist (GW4064) or a vehicle control for 7\u2009weeks, and cardiac performance was assessed by consecutive echocardiography studies. Administration of GW4064 significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction at 4\u2009weeks and 8\u2009weeks after MI (both P\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, GW4064 treatment increased angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced cardiomyocyte loss and inflammation, and ameliorated cardiac remodelling as evidenced by heart weight, lung weight, atrial natriuretic peptide/brain natriuretic peptide levels, and myocardial fibrosis at 8\u2009weeks post-MI. At the molecular level, GW4064 significantly increased FXR mRNA expression and transcriptional activity in heart tissue. Moreover, over-expression of myocardial FXR failed to exert significant cardioprotection in vivo, indicating that GW4064 improved post-MI heart remodelling and function independent of myocardial FXR expression/activity. Among the four down-stream soluble molecules of FXR, plasma adiponectin was most significantly increased by GW4064. In cultured adipocytes, GW4064 increased mRNA levels and protein expression of adiponectin. Conditioned medium of GW4064-treated adipocytes activated AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signalling and reduced hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, all of which were attenuated by an adiponectin neutralizing anti-body. More importantly, when knocking-out adiponectin in mice, the cardioprotective effects of GW4064 were attenuated.\nWe are the first to show that FXR agonism ameliorated post-MI cardiac dysfunction and remodelling by stimulating adiponectin secretion. Thus, we demonstrated that FXR agonism is a potential therapeutic strategy in post-MI heart failure.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2018-04-19", "authors": ["YunlongXia", "FuyangZhang", "ShihaoZhao", "YueyangLi", "XiyaoChen", "ErheGao", "XinyueXu", "ZhenyuXiong", "XiaomengZhang", "JinglongZhang", "HuishouZhao", "WeiWang", "HelinWang", "YanjieGuo", "YiLiu", "CongyeLi", "ShanWang", "LingZhang", "WenjunYan", "LingTao"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvy093"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional collagenous niche and azacytidine selectively promote time-dependent cardiomyogenesis from human bone marrow-derived MSC spheroids.", "abstract": "Endogenous adult cardiac regenerative machinery is not capable of replacing the lost cells following myocardial infarction, often leading to permanent alterations in structure-function-mechanical properties. Regenerative therapies based on delivering autologous stem cells within an appropriate 3D milieu could meet such demand, by enabling homing and directed differentiation of the transplanted cells into lost specialized cell populations. Since type I collagen is the predominant cardiac tissue matrix protein, we here optimized the 3D niche which could promote time-dependent evolution of cardiomyogenesis from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC). 3D collagen gel physical and mechanical characteristics were assessed using SEM and AFM, respectively, while the standalone and combined effects of collagen concentration, culture duration, and 5-azacytidine (aza) dose on the phenotype and genotype of MSC spheroids were quantified using immunofluorescence labeling and RT-PCR analysis. Increasing collagen concentration led to a significant increase in Young's modulus (p\u2009<\u20090.01) but simultaneous decrease in the mean pore size, resulting in stiffer gels. Spheroid formation significantly modulated MSC differentiation and genotype, mostly due to better cell-cell interactions. Among the aza dosages tested, 10\u2009\u03bcM appears to be optimal, while 3\u2009mg/ml gels resulted in significantly lower cell viability compared to 1 or 2\u2009mg/ml gels. Stiffer gels (2 and 3\u2009mg/ml) and exposure to 10\u2009\u03bcM aza upregulated early and late cardiac marker expressions in a time-dependent fashion. On the other hand, cell-cell signaling within the MSC spheroids seem to have a strong role in influencing mature cardiac markers expression, since neither aza nor gel stiffness seem to significantly improve their expression. Western blot analysis suggested that canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway might be primarily mediating the observed benefits of aza on cardiac differentiation of MSC spheroids. In conclusion, 2\u2009mg/ml collagen and 10\u2009\u03bcM aza appears to offer optimal 3D microenvironment in terms of cell viability and time-dependent evolution of cardiomyogenesis from human BM-MSCs, with significant applications in cardiac tissue engineering and stem cell transplantation for regenerating lost cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2018-04-18", "authors": ["JyotsnaJoshi", "GautamMahajan", "Chandrasekhar RKothapalli"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.26714"}
{"title": "Quantitatively characterizing drug-induced arrhythmic contractile motions of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Quantification of abnormal contractile motions of cardiac tissue has been a noteworthy challenge and significant limitation in assessing and classifying the drug-induced arrhythmias (i.e., Torsades de pointes). To overcome these challenges, researchers have taken advantage of computational image processing tools to measure contractile motion from cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). However, the amplitude and frequency analysis of contractile motion waveforms does not produce sufficient information to objectively classify the degree of variations between two or more sets of cardiac contractile motions. In this paper, we generated contractile motion data from beating hiPSC-CMs using motion tracking software based on optical flow analysis, and then implemented a computational algorithm, phase space reconstruction (PSR), to derive parameters (embedding, regularity, and fractal dimensions) to further characterize the dynamic nature of the cardiac contractile motions. Application of drugs known to cause cardiac arrhythmia induced significant changes to these resultant dimensional parameters calculated from PSR analysis. Integrating this new computational algorithm with the existing analytical toolbox of cardiac contractile motions will allow us to expand current assessments of cardiac tissue physiology into an automated, high-throughput, and quantifiable manner which will allow more objective assessments of drug-induced proarrhythmias.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2018-04-18", "authors": ["PlanskyHoang", "NathanielHuebsch", "Shin HyukBang", "Brian ASiemons", "Bruce RConklin", "Kevin EHealy", "ZhenMa", "SabirJacquir"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.26709\n10.1155/2011/729732\n10.1515/slgr-2016-0046\n10.1002/mrm.22170\n10.1063/1.3227736\n10.1214/11-STS370\n10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783226\n10.1039/c0an00208a\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0283\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.09.017\n10.1038/srep11817\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001883\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.02.007\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1134/S0006350906010179\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.10.020\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000570\n10.1103/PhysRevE.58.6392\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.03.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.65.5.894\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1996.tb03306.x\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.06.005\n10.1002/stem.166\n10.3390/ijms17020186"}

Conventional biomarkers provide limited insight into the exercise-induced adaptive processes. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are dynamically regulated in response to acute exhaustive exercise and sustained rowing, running and cycling exercises. However, circulating miRNAs in response to long-term basketball exercise remains unknown. Here, we enrolled 10 basketball athletes who will attend a basketball season for 3 months. Specifically, circulating miRNAs which were involved in angiogenesis, inflammation and enriched in muscle and/or cardiac tissues were analyzed at baseline, immediately following acute exhaustive exercise and after 3-month basketball matches in competitive male basketball athletes. Circulating miR-208b was decreased and miR-221 was increased after 3-month basketball exercise, while circulating miR-221, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-210 were reduced at post-acute exercise. The change of miR-146a (baseline vs. post-acute exercise) showed linear correlations with baseline levels of cardiac marker CKMB and the changes of inflammation marker Hs-CRP (baseline vs. post-acute exercise).

In many pathological settings, diverse remodeling of the tissue microenvironment is correlated with arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output, but the precise impact of tissue remodeling on propagation is not completely understood. Our objective was to delineate how multiple features within the cardiac tissue microenvironment modulate propagation velocity.\nTo recapitulate diverse myocardial tissue microenvironments, we engineered substrates with tunable elasticity, patterning, composition, and topography using two formulations of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropatterned with fibronectin and gelatin hydrogels with flat or micromolded features. We cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes on these substrates and quantified cell density, tissue alignment, and cell shape. We used a fluorescent calcium indicator, high-speed microscopy, and newly-developed analysis software to record and quantify calcium wave propagation velocity (CPV).\nFor all substrates, tissue alignment and cell aspect ratio were higher in aligned compared to isotropic tissues. Isotropic CPV and longitudinal CPV were similar across conditions, but transverse CPV was lower on micromolded gelatin hydrogels compared to micropatterned soft and stiff PDMS. In aligned tissues, the anisotropy ratio of CPV (longitudinal CPV/transverse CPV) was lower on micropatterned soft PDMS compared to micropatterned stiff PDMS and micromolded gelatin hydrogels.\nPropagation velocity in engineered cardiac tissues is sensitive to features in the tissue microenvironment, such as alignment, matrix elasticity, and matrix topography, which may underlie arrhythmias in conditions with pathological tissue remodeling.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular bioengineering", "date": "2018-04-17", "authors": ["Andrew PPetersen", "Davi MLyra-Leite", "Nethika RAriyasinghe", "NathanCho", "Celeste MGoodwin", "Joon YoungKim", "Megan LMcCain"], "doi": "10.1007/s12195-018-0522-2\n10.1039/c3lc50350j\n10.1039/C7IB00081B\n10.1172/JCI31044\n10.1152/ajpheart.01017.2005\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1038/srep28855\n10.1007/s12013-016-0758-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1161/01.RES.0000047530.88338.EB\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.07.005\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.07.015\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.00959.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.1.161\n10.1093/cvr/22.10.686\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1021/nl100998p\n10.1054/jcaf.2002.129280\n10.1039/c1lc20557a\n10.1172/JCI108079\n10.1056/NEJMoa1002659\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1161/JAHA.117.006084\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00426.2011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00290.2017\n10.1161/01.RES.85.11.1046\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.052\n10.1152/ajpheart.01218.2010\n10.1073/pnas.1304913110\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.022\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000570\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.016\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051499\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.4.1161\n10.1038/nprot.2009.234\n10.1016/j.vascn.2013.03.005\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00846-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.214429\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.001\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.06.010\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.06.003\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7283-8_11\n10.1161/01.RES.56.3.436\n10.1161/01.RES.87.4.316"}

In the present study, we hypothesized a protective role of dual-specificity phosphatase 14 (DUSP14) in myocardial IR, as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. The results indicated that DUSP14 was down-regulated following cardiac IR injury. Subsequently, the wild type (WT) and DUSP14-knockout (KO) mice were included to further reveal the potential role of DUSP14 in cardiac IR injury progression. DUSP14-KO mice exhibited increased infarction area and elevated apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased TUNEL-positive cells in ischemia heart following reperfusion compared to WT mice. Further, DUSP14-KO significantly aggregated cardiac dysfunction of mice after IR injury. Cardiac IR injury to DUSP14-KO mice led to markedly increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway in the heart in comparison to WT mice. Meanwhile, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38, ERK1/2 and JNK, were significantly activated by DUSO14-KO in mice after IR injury. Compared to WT mice, DUSP14-KO mice showed markedly increased oxidative stress markers in cardiac tissues, including malondialdehyde (MDA), NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4) and p47, while decreased activities or expressions of anti-oxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathion reductases (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). DUSP14-knockdown (KD) in primary cardiomyocytes using its specific siRNA sequence elevated hypoxia and reoxygenation (HR)-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Intriguingly, pre-treatment of ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), markedly abolished DUSP14-KD-augmented NF-\u03baB and MAPKs activation in HR-stimulated primary cardiomyocytes. Together, the results above indicated that DUSP14 might be served as a positive regulator to attenuate cardiac IR injury. Suppressing DUSP14 exacerbated cardiac injury through activating NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways regulated by ROS production.

{"title": "HIF1 mediates a switch in pyruvate kinase isoforms after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Alternative splicing of RNA is an underexplored area of transcriptional response. We expect that early changes in alternatively spliced genes may be important for responses to cardiac injury. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a key transcription factor that rapidly responds to loss of oxygen through alteration of metabolism and angiogenesis. The goal of this study was to investigate the transcriptional response after myocardial infarction (MI) and to identify novel, hypoxia-driven changes, including alternative splicing. After ligation of the left anterior descending artery in mice, we observed an abrupt loss of cardiac contractility and upregulation of hypoxic signaling. We then performed RNA sequencing on ischemic heart tissue 1 and 3 days after infarct to assess early transcriptional changes and identified 89 transcripts with altered splicing. Of particular interest was the switch in Pkm isoform expression (pyruvate kinase, muscle). The usually predominant Pkm1 isoform was less abundant in ischemic hearts, while Pkm2 and associated splicing factors (hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, Ptbp1) rapidly increased. Despite increased Pkm2 expression, total pyruvate kinase activity remained reduced in ischemic myocardial tissue.

Significantly different from regular 4D printing techniques, this study focuses on creating novel 4D hierarchical micropatterns using a unique photolithographic-stereolithographic-tandem strategy (PSTS) with smart soybean oil epoxidized acrylate (SOEA) inks for effectively regulating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) cardiomyogenic behaviors. The 4D effect refers to autonomous conversion of the surficial-patterned scaffold into a predesigned construct through an external stimulus delivered immediately after printing. Our results show that hMSCs actively grew and were highly aligned along the micropatterns, forming an uninterrupted cellular sheet. The generation of complex patterns was evident by triangular and circular outlines appearing in the scaffolds. This simple, yet efficient, technique was validated by rapid printing of scaffolds with well-defined and consistent micro-surface features. A 4D dynamic shape change transforming a 2-D design into flower-like structures was observed. The printed scaffolds possessed a shape memory effect beyond the 4D features. The advanced 4D dynamic feature may provide seamless integration with damaged tissues or organs, and a proof of concept 4D patch for cardiac regeneration was demonstrated for the first time.

By using a computational simulation compared to mechanical tests, we sought to investigate the characteristics of stress-induced suture material on porcine myocardium.\nTensile strength experiments (n\u202f=\u202f8) were performed on bulk left myocardium to establish a hyperelastic reduced polynomial constitutive law. Simultaneously, suture strength tests on left myocardium (n\u202f=\u202f6) were performed with a standard tensile test setup. Experiments were made on bulk ventricular wall with a single U-suture (polypropylene 3-0) and a PTFE pledget. Then, a Finite Element simulation of a LVAD suture case was performed. Strength versus displacement behavior was compared between mechanical and numerical experiments. Local stress fields in the model were thus analyzed.\nA strong correlation between the experimental and the numerical responses was observed, validating the relevance of the numerical model. A secure damage limit of 100 kPa on heart tissue was defined from mechanical suture testing and used to describe numerical results. The impact of suture on heart tissue could be accurately determined through new parameters of numerical data (stress diffusion, triaxiality stress). Finally, an ideal spacing between sutures of 2\u202fmm was proposed.\nOur computational model showed a reliable ability to provide and predict various local tissue stresses created by suture penetration into the myocardium. In addition, this model contributed to providing valuable information useful to design less traumatic sutures for LVAD implantation.

Alternative experimental models are required to contextualize and reconcile discordant published observations of cardiac c-Kit myocardial biology and provide meaningful insights regarding clinical relevance of c-Kit signaling for translational cell therapy.\nThe main objectives of this study are as follows: demonstrating c-Kit myocardial biology through combined studies of both human and murine cardiac cells; advancing understanding of c-Kit myocardial biology through creation and characterization of a novel, inducible transgenic c-Kit reporter mouse model that overcomes limitations inherent to knock-in reporter models; and providing perspective to reconcile disparate viewpoints on c-Kit biology in the myocardium.\nIn vitro studies confirm a critical role for c-Kit signaling in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac stem cells. Activation of c-Kit receptor promotes cell survival and proliferation in stem cells and cardiomyocytes of either human or murine origin. For creation of the mouse model, the cloned mouse c-Kit promoter drives Histone2B-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein; H2BEGFP) expression in a doxycycline-inducible transgenic reporter line. The combination of c-Kit transgenesis coupled to H2BEGFP readout provides sensitive, specific, inducible, and persistent tracking of c-Kit promoter activation. Tagging efficiency for EGFP+/c-Kit+ cells is similar between our transgenic versus a c-Kit knock-in mouse line, but frequency of c-Kit+ cells in cardiac tissue from the knock-in model is 55% lower than that from our transgenic line. The c-Kit transgenic reporter model reveals intimate association of c-Kit expression with adult myocardial biology. Both cardiac stem cells and a subpopulation of cardiomyocytes express c-Kit in uninjured adult heart, upregulating c-Kit expression in response to pathological stress.\nc-Kit myocardial biology is more complex and varied than previously appreciated or documented, demonstrating validity in multiple points of coexisting yet heretofore seemingly irreconcilable published findings.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2018-04-11", "authors": ["Natalie AGude", "FarehehFirouzi", "Kathleen MBroughton", "KelliIlves", "Kristine PNguyen", "Christina RPayne", "VeronicaSacchi", "Megan MMonsanto", "Alexandria RCasillas", "Farid GKhalafalla", "Bingyan JWang", "David EEbeid", "RobertoAlvarez", "Walter PDembitsky", "Barbara ABailey", "Jopvan Berlo", "Mark ASussman"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311828"}

Cardiomyogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in 3D poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers and macroporous scaffolds was compared with two-dimensional (2D) PCL films. In addition, nanofiber mats of PCL and its blend with gelatin (PCL-Gel) were prepared with fibers of random or unidirectional alignment to assess the roles of topography (fibrous architecture and its alignment) and biochemical cue (cell-adhesive sites) in directing cell functions. Cells on 3D random nanofibers, exhibited elevated expression of known cardiac markers such as cardiac actinin, cardiac troponin and \u03b2-myocardial heavy chain compared to cells on 2D films suggesting enhanced differentiation that was further accentuated on the aligned fibers. 3D macroporous scaffolds did not enhance the cardiomyogenic differentiation. However, minimal differences were noted between cells on PCL and PCL-Gel fibers, irrespective of alignment. Co-culture with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes induced beating in the differentiated cells. The use of small molecule inhibitors revealed that cytoskeletal elements F-actin, microtubules and downstream ROCK protein are essential for the cardiomyogenesis of hMSCs on the nanofibers. The activation of ERK, AKT and mTOR was observed during cardiomyogenesis. Interestingly, enhanced differentiation on the aligned nanofibers was associated with increased level of the histone deacytelase SIRT6 and decreased level of the acetylated histone H3K9 suggesting a role for epigenetic regulation. This study demonstrates that aligned nanofibrous scaffolds augment cardiomyogenic differentiation wherein topography plays a critical role in driving stem cell function.

Thereby, we hypothesized that a cardiac-specific induction of PPAR\u03b1 might restore the FAO-related protein expression and resultant energy deficit. In the present study, consequences of PPAR\u03b1 augmentation were evaluated for amelioration of chronic oxidative stress, myocyte apoptosis, and cardiac function during pathological cardiac hypertrophy.\nNanotized PPAR\u03b1 overexpression targeted to myocardium was done by a stearic acid-modified carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMC) conjugated to a 20-mer myocyte-targeted peptide (CMCP). Overexpression of PPAR\u03b1 ameliorated pathological hypertrophy and improved cardiac function. Augmented PPAR\u03b1 in hypertrophied myocytes revealed downregulated p53 acetylation (lys 382), leading to reduced apoptosis. Such cells showed increased binding of PPAR\u03b1 with p53 that in turn reduced interaction of p53 with glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which upregulated inactive phospho-GSK3\u03b2 (serine [Ser]9) expression within mitochondrial protein fraction. Altogether, the altered molecular milieu in PPAR\u03b1-overexpressed hypertrophy groups restored mitochondrial structure and function both in vitro and in vivo.\nCardiomyocyte-targeted overexpression of a protein of interest (PPAR\u03b1) by nanotized plasmid has been described for the first time in this study. Our data provide a novel insight towards regression of pathological hypertrophy by ameliorating mitochondrial oxidative stress in targeted PPAR\u03b1-overexpressed myocardium.\nPPAR\u03b1-overexpression during pathological hypertrophy showed substantial betterment of mitochondrial structure and function, along with downregulated apoptosis.

Following ischemic injury, significant matrix remodeling and the formation of avascular scar tissue significantly impairs cell engraftment and survival in the damaged myocardium. This limits the efficacy of cell replacement therapies, demanding strategies that reduce pathological scarring to create a suitable microenvironment for healthy tissue regeneration. Here, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of discrete hyaluronic acid (HA)-based microrods to provide local biochemical and biomechanical signals to reprogram cells and attenuate cardiac fibrosis. HA microrods were produced in a range of physiological stiffness and shown to degrade in the presence of hyaluronidase. Additionally, we show that fibroblasts interact with these microrods in\u00a0vitro, leading to significant changes in proliferation, collagen expression and other markers of a myofibroblast phenotype.

However, the patches used in this treatment have some limitations such as stiffness and calcification. Engineering heart tissues (EHTs) have emerged as a promising biomaterial to repair damaged heart. Nevertheless, selecting optimal candidate cells for EHTs has been controversial. Aging is a major consideration for seed cells derived from elderly patients. Hence, this study was aimed to assess the proliferation of, antiapoptosis potential of, and expression of senescence-associated factors (eg, SA-\u03b2-Gal, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (P16), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (P21) in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. In addition, cardiac function, cell survival, and angiogenesis of ADSCs and BMSCs after SVR were assessed in vivo. The in vitro results showed that old ADSCs (OAs) grew faster; expressed lower levels of SA-\u03b2-Gal, P16, and P21; and possessed more pronounced antiapoptosis activity than old BMSCs (OBs). The in vivo results demonstrated that 28 days after patch implantation, animals that received OAs patches showed better restoration of cardiac function than animals that received OBs patches. Meanwhile, old ADSCs possessed more potential regarding cell survival and angiogenesis. These results suggest that ADSCs may be superior to BMSCs with regard to autologous cell transplantation in elderly patients.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2018-04-10", "authors": ["HuaWu", "Jian-ZhongLi", "Bao-DongXie", "HaiTian", "Shao-HongFang", "Shu-LinJiang", "KaiKang"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2017.0271"}

However, the mechanism is still unknown. Here we employed microRNA array analysis of the heart tissue of HSF1-knockout (KO) mice to investigate the potential roles of microRNAs in pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling under HSF-1 deficiency, and the profiles of 478 microRNAs expressed in the heart tissues of adult HSF1-KO mice were determined. We found that the expression of 5 microRNAs was over 2-fold higher expressed in heart tissues of HSF1-KO mice than in those of wild-type (WT) control mice. Of the overexpressed microRNAs, miR-195a-3p had the highest expression level in HSF1-null endothelial cells (ECs). Induction with miR-195a-3p in ECs significantly suppressed CD31 and VEGF, promoted AngII-induced EC apoptosis, and impaired capillary-like tube formation. In vivo, the upregulation of miR-195a-3p accentuated cardiac hypertrophy, increased the expression of \u03b2-MHC and ANP, and compromised systolic function in mice under pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). By contrast, antagonism of miR-195a-3p had the opposite effect on HSF1-KO mice. Further experiments confirmed that AMPK\u03b12 was the direct target of miR-195a-3p. AMPK\u03b12 overexpression rescued the reduction of eNOS and VEGF, and the impairment of angiogenesis that was induced by miR-195a-3p. In addition, upregulation of AMPK\u03b12 in the myocardium of HSF1-null mice by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery enhanced CD31, eNOS and VEGF, reduced \u03b2-MHC and ANP, alleviated pressure overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and restored cardiac function. Our findings revealed that the upregulation of miR-195a-3p due to HSF1 deficiency impaired cardiac angiogenesis by regulating AMPK\u03b12/VEGF signaling, which disrupted the coordination between the myocardial blood supply and the adaptive hypertrophic response and accelerated the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure in response to pressure overload.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-04-08", "authors": ["ShijunWang", "JianWu", "JieyunYou", "HongyuShi", "XiaoyuXue", "JiayuanHuang", "LeiXu", "GuoliangJiang", "LingyanYuan", "XueGong", "HaiyanLuo", "JunboGe", "ZhaoqiangCui", "YunzengZou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.017"}

{"title": "Oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The science and engineering of biomaterials have improved the human life expectancy. Tissue engineering is one of the nascent strategies with an aim to fulfill this target. Tissue engineering scaffolds are one of the most significant aspects of the recent tissue repair strategies; hence, it is imperative to design biomimetic substrates with suitable features. Conductive substrates can ameliorate the cellular activity through enhancement of cellular signaling. Biocompatible polymers with conductivity can mimic the cells' niche in an appropriate manner. Bioconductive polymers based on aniline oligomers can potentially actualize this purpose because of their unique and tailoring properties. The aniline oligomers can be positioned within the molecular structure of other polymers, thus painter acting with the side groups of the main polymer or acting as a comonomer in their backbone. The conductivity of oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials can be tailored to mimic the electrical and mechanical properties of targeted tissues/organs. These bioconductive substrates can be designed with high mechanical strength for hard tissues such as the bone and with high elasticity to be used for the cardiac tissue or can be synthesized in the form of injectable hydrogels, particles, and nanofibers for noninvasive implantation; these structures can be used for applications such as drug/gene delivery and extracellular biomimetic structures. It is expected that with progress in the fields of biomaterials and tissue engineering, more innovative constructs will be proposed in the near future. This review discusses the recent advancements in the use of oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.\nThe tissue engineering applications of aniline oligomers and their derivatives have recently attracted an increasing interest due to their electroactive and biodegradable properties. However, no reports have systematically reviewed the critical role of oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials in tissue engineering. Research on aniline oligomers is growing today opening new scenarios that expand the potential of these biomaterials from \"traditional\" treatments to a new era of tissue engineering. The conductivity of this class of biomaterials can be tailored similar to that of tissues/organs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review article in which such issue is systematically reviewed and critically discussed in the light of the existing literature. Undoubtedly, investigations on the use of oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials in tissue engineering need further advancement and a lot of critical questions are yet to be answered.

PVI was achieved in 100% of the veins if the impedance reached 500 \u03a9 in <90 seconds with freeze time of 90 seconds. When 500 \u03a9 was reached >90 to 180 seconds (142.60\u00b129.3 seconds), 90% PVI was achieved. When the final impedance was between 200 and 500 \u03a9 with 180 seconds of freeze time, PVI was achieved in 86.8%. For impedance of <200 \u03a9, PVI was achieved in 14%. No extracardiac damage was recorded.\nImpedance rise of 500 \u03a9 at <90 seconds with freeze time of 90 seconds resulted in 100% PVI. Impedance measurements from the nose of the balloon is a direct measure of ice formation on the balloon. It provides real-time feedback on the quality of the ablation and defines the cryoapplication termination time based on ice formation, limiting ice expansion to extracardiac tissues.", "journal": "Circulation.

Here, we explored the interactions between miRNAs and their target genes as an adaptation to high altitude in an avian species, the great tit (Parus major), which is widely distributed across the Eurasian continent at altitudes between 4500 m and sea level. Because the MAPK signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the hypoxia response in the great tit, we chose MAPK1 as a target candidate gene.\nWe established a great tit embryonic fibroblast line and subsequently studied the relationship between miRNA-19b-3p and MAPK1 in normoxia and hypoxia groups. Meanwhile, the great tit embryonic fibroblasts (GEFs) were treated or transfected with miR-19b-3p mimics, inhibitors, or si-MAPK1, and their proliferation was subsequently assessed using the MTT assay. The expression of the miRNAs and MAPK1 was measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting.\nWe identified 14 miRNAs in the cardiac tissues of great tits that are related to hypoxia adaptation. MAPK1 binds only to miR-19b-3p of the 14 miRNAs predicted by both TargetScan and miRanda software. Specifically, we validated the computational prediction of miR-19b-3p binding to the 3'UTR of MAPK1 using a luciferase reporter assay. Our results show that miR-19b-3p promotes GEFs proliferation and up-regulates MAPK1 expression. Moreover, miR-19b-3p mimics and MAPK1 knockdown induce GEFs apoptosis and regulate the cell cycle under hypoxic conditions.\nOur study is the first to describe an important miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of high altitude adaptation in a non-model wild songbird and highlights the importance of studies on miRNA-mediated mechanisms of hypoxic adaptations in other animals.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2018-04-05", "authors": ["XiuminChen", "YanhuaQu", "YalinCheng", "JingWang", "XiaohuaLei", "GangSong", "HuishanZhang", "HaitaoWang", "FuminLei"], "doi": "10.1159/000488621"}

Using the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, to assess impacts from these contaminants may be advantageous as adults live and breed in such environments. Adult amphibians typically exhibit elevated tissue concentrations of contaminants present in their environment, while larval stages were found to exhibit increased sensitivity to pollutants. From January through March of 2015, during the spring breeding season, 5 adults and approximately 32 egg masses were collected from a local breeding site. Field levels of As and Cr ranged from 5.99 to 8.88\u00a0\u00b5g/L and 1.45 to 2\u00a0\u00b5g/L, respectively, while mean adult As tissue concentrations were 56.74\u00a0\u00b5g/g dry weight for heart, 0.92\u00a0\u00b5g/g for liver, and 1.21\u00a0\u00b5g/g for tail tissue.

The expression of Nrn1 in human cancers were assessed using the online tools GEPIA.\nNrn1 mRNA was expressed in various tissues, compared to mRNA levels in the brain tissues, expression was high in the placenta, lungs, skeletal muscle, thymus, pancreas, liver and the heart tissues; lower levels were detected in the small intestine, ovary, spleen, and testes, but there was no detectable expression in the kidneys, colon, prostate or leukocytes.

However, the immaturity of hiPSC-CMs currently limits their use. Because mechanical loading increases during development and facilitates cardiac maturation, we hypothesized that afterload would promote maturation of EHTs. To test this we developed a system in which EHTs are suspended between a rigid post and a flexible one, whose resistance to contraction can be modulated by applying braces of varying length. These braces allow us to adjust afterload conditions over two orders of magnitude by increasing the flexible post resistance from 0.09 up to 9.2\u202f\u03bcN/\u03bcm. After three weeks in culture, optical tracking of post deflections revealed that auxotonic twitch forces increased in correlation with the degree of afterload, whereas twitch velocities decreased with afterload. Consequently, the power and work of the EHTs were maximal under intermediate afterloads. When studied isometrically, the inotropy of EHTs increased with afterload up to an intermediate resistance (0.45\u202f\u03bcN/\u03bcm) and then plateaued. Applied afterload increased sarcomere length, cardiomyocyte area and elongation, which are hallmarks of maturation. Furthermore, progressively increasing the level of afterload led to improved calcium handling, increased expression of several key markers of cardiac maturation, including a shift from fetal to adult ventricular myosin heavy chain isoforms. However, at the highest afterload condition, markers of pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis were also upregulated, although the bulk tissue stiffness remained the same for all levels of applied afterload tested. Together, our results indicate that application of moderate afterloads can substantially improve the maturation of hiPSC-CMs in EHTs, while high afterload conditions may mimic certain aspects of human cardiac pathology resulting from elevated mechanical overload.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2018-04-01", "authors": ["AndreaLeonard", "AlessandroBertero", "Joseph DPowers", "Kevin MBeussman", "ShivBhandari", "MichaelRegnier", "Charles EMurry", "Nathan JSniadecki"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016"}

Using this system, we investigated the relationship between contractile proficiency and metabolism in neonate rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) cultured on gels with stiffness mimicking soft immature (1 kPa), normal healthy (13 kPa), and stiff diseased (90 kPa) cardiac microenvironments. We found that tissues engineered on the softest gels generated the least amount of stress and had the smallest work output. Conversely, cardiomyocytes in tissues engineered on healthy- and disease-mimicking gels generated significantly higher stresses, with the maximal contractile work measured in NRVM engineered on gels of normal stiffness. Interestingly, although tissues on soft gels exhibited poor stress generation and work production, their basal metabolic respiration rate was significantly more elevated than in other groups, suggesting a highly ineffective coupling between energy production and contractile work output.

{"title": "Distribution of Eight QT-Prolonging Drugs and Their Main Metabolites Between Postmortem Cardiac Tissue and Blood Reveals Potential Pitfalls in Toxicological Interpretation.", "abstract": "Femoral blood concentrations are usually used in postmortem toxicology to assess possible toxic effects of drugs. This includes QT-prolongation and other cardiac dysrhythmia, which could have been the cause of death. However, blood concentration is only a surrogate for the active site concentration, and therefore cardiac tissue concentration may provide a more accurate toxicological interpretation. Thus, cardiac tissue and femoral and cardiac blood concentrations were examined for eight frequently used QT-prolonging drugs (QTD) and their metabolites in a mentally ill population. In total, 180 cases were included from the Danish autopsy-based forensic study SURVIVE. The concentrations were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry utilizing stable isotopically labeled internal standards. The results showed that the cardiac tissue concentrations were significantly higher compared to femoral and cardiac blood concentrations, with two exceptions. The median cardiac tissue-to-femoral blood concentration ratio (Kb) ranged from 2.2 (venlafaxine) to 15 (nortriptyline). The inter-individual fold difference between the minimum and maximum Kb ranged from 2.6-fold (Z-hydroxynortriptyline) to 61 (venlafaxine). For 12 compounds, postmortem redistribution appeared to be minimal, whereas four compounds displayed some degree of postmortem redistribution. Citalopram and quetiapine were selected for in-depth analysis of the relation between the toxicological interpretation and femoral blood/cardiac tissue concentrations. Within this dataset, citalopram displayed a wide overlap in cardiac tissue concentrations (~50%) between non-toxic and toxic citalopram cases, as estimated from femoral blood concentrations. In contrast, quetiapine displayed no overlap in cardiac tissue concentrations between non-toxic and toxic quetiapine cases based on femoral blood concentrations. The implication of the citalopram finding is that possible intoxications can be overlooked when only considering femoral blood concentrations. Based on the present findings, non-toxic cardiac tissue 10th-90th percentile concentration ranges were estimated for citalopram (0.93-4.4 mg/kg) and quetiapine (0.0073-0.60 mg/kg).", "journal": "Journal of analytical toxicology", "date": "2018-03-27", "authors": ["Christian RMikkelsen", "Jakob RJornil", "Ljubica VAndersen", "JytteBanner", "J\u00f8rgen BHasselstr\u00f8m"], "doi": "10.1093/jat/bky018"}

{"title": "PPAR\u03b1 activation alleviates damage to the cytoskeleton during acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats.", "abstract": "The cytoskeleton serves an important role in maintaining cellular morphology and function, and it is a substrate of calpain during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (MIRI). Calpain may be activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during MIRI. The activation of peroxisome proliferator\u2011activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) may inhibit ischemia/reperfusion damage by regulating stress reactions. The present study aimed to determine whether the activation of PPAR\u03b1 protects against MIRI\u2011induced cytoskeletal degradation, and investigated the underlying mechanism involved. Wistar rats were pretreated with or without fenofibrate and subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 45\u00a0min, followed by 120\u00a0min of reperfusion. Calpain activity and the expression of PPAR\u03b1, desmin and ER stress parameters were evaluated. Electrocardiography was performed and cardiac function was evaluated. The ultrastructure was observed under transmission electron microscopy. I/R significantly induced damage to the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocytes and cardiac dysfunction, all of which were improved by PPAR\u03b1 activation.

This study evaluated the cardioprotective effect of rosuvastatin on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction injury in rats. A rat model of myocardial infarction injury was induced by isoproterenol\u00a0(ISO) for 2\u00a0consecutive days, rosuvastatin was administered for 8\u00a0weeks. The levels of myocardial infarct size, aspartate transaminase\u00a0(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase\u00a0(SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) activities and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe cardiac histological changes. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 levels in heart tissues were detected with ELISA kits. The mRNA and protein levels of NOD-like receptor superfamily, pyrin domain containing\u00a03 (NLRP3) inflammasome were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Our results showed that treatment with rosuvastatin reduced myocardial infract area, ameliorated histopathological alterations in myocardium, and decreased activities of myocardial injury marker enzymes in ISO-induced rats. In addition, rosuvastatin remarkably restored ISO-induced elevation of lipid peroxidation and decrease of antioxidants, significantly reduced myocardial pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations in this animal model. Furthermore, rosuvastatin significantly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in this animal model. This study demonstrates that rosuvastatin significantly alleviates ISO-induced myocardial infarction injury.

{"title": "Defects formation and spiral waves in a network of neurons in presence of electromagnetic induction.", "abstract": "Complex anatomical and physiological structure of an excitable tissue (e.g., cardiac tissue) in the body can represent different electrical activities through normal or abnormal behavior. Abnormalities of the excitable tissue coming from different biological reasons can lead to formation of some defects. Such defects can cause some successive waves that may end up to some additional reorganizing beating behaviors like spiral waves or target waves. In this study, formation of defects and the resulting emitted waves in an excitable tissue are investigated. We have considered a square array network of neurons with nearest-neighbor connections to describe the excitable tissue. Fundamentally, electrophysiological properties of ion currents in the body are responsible for exhibition of electrical spatiotemporal patterns. More precisely, fluctuation of accumulated ions inside and outside of cell causes variable electrical and magnetic field. Considering undeniable mutual effects of electrical field and magnetic field, we have proposed the new Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuronal model for the local dynamics of each individual neuron in the network. In this new neuronal model, the influence of magnetic flow on membrane potential is defined. This improved model holds more bifurcation parameters. Moreover, the dynamical behavior of the tissue is investigated in different states of quiescent, spiking, bursting and even chaotic state.

Furthermore, new delivery systems for these therapeutic agents have enhanced their regenerative and cardioprotective potential. In particular, nano- and microparticles (NPs and MPs) are promising. These systems may be administered directly in the infarcted myocardium or reach the heart after intravenous injection due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect or active targeting.

Transcriptional regulators PPAR\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 are known to be involved in this radiation response. PPAR\u03b1, an anti-inflammatory transcription factor controlling cardiac energy metabolism, is inactivated by irradiation. The pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic TGF\u03b2 is activated by irradiation via SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways. The goal of this study was to investigate how altering the level of PPAR\u03b1 influences the radiation response of these signaling pathways. For this purpose, we used genetically modified C57Bl/6 mice with wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) PPAR\u03b1 genotype. Mice were locally irradiated to the heart using doses of 8 or 16 Gy; the controls were sham-irradiated. The heart tissue was investigated using label-free proteomics 20 weeks after the irradiation and the predicted pathways were validated using immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. The heterozygous PPAR\u03b1 mice showed most radiation-induced changes in the cardiac proteome, whereas the homozygous PPAR\u03b1 mice showed the least changes. Irradiation induced SMAD-dependent TGF\u03b2 signaling independently of the PPAR\u03b1 status, but the presence of PPAR\u03b1 was necessary for the activation of the SMAD-independent pathway.

A total of 107 scans (50 patients; mean age, 64.3 years \u00b1 13.2 [standard deviation]) had metabolic tissue burden assessed by using total lesion glycolysis (TLG) obtained from autosegmentation of the tumor and/or cardiac tissue. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and subsequent normalized SUV uptake in target organs and tissues were compared with 436 FDG PET/CT scans previously reported in 229 patients as a function of TLG to describe the effect(s) that metabolic burden has on reference tissue (blood pool, liver, and brain) FDG uptake. Subsequent regression by using linear mixed-effects models was used. If the slope of the regression was significantly (P < .05) different than zero, then an effect from TLG was present. Results There was a negative inverse relationship (P < .0001) between FDG uptake within reference tissues (blood pool, liver, and brain) and TLG in comparison to the study population at similar blood glucose levels. This TLG effect was no longer statistically significant (P > .05) when FDG uptake was normalized to a reference tissue (eg, blood pool or liver).

Because tissue functions and cells surrounding fibroblasts in\u00a0vivo are different among tissues, the properties of fibroblasts might be different according to their tissue origin. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of fibroblasts may lead to fabrication of bioengineered tissues close to biological tissues. In this study, we found a unique less angiogenic property of human cardiac fibroblasts in\u00a0vitro compared with human dermal fibroblasts and identified the responsible gene. Cardiac fibroblasts inhibited vascular network formation in co-cultures with various types of vascular endothelial cells. Using microarray analysis and short interfering RNA (siRNA) screening experiments, we identified Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 1 (LYPD1) as responsible for the lack of endothelial cell network formation mediated by cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibition of the LYPD1 gene by siRNA attenuated the anti-angiogenic properties of cardiac fibroblasts, whereas the functional defect was rescued by addition of recombinant LYPD1.

It is an accumulative slackening of various complications including myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CAD), hypertension, valvular heart disease (VHD) and cardiomyopathy; its hallmarks include hypertrophy, increased interstitial fibrosis and loss of myocytes. The etiology of CHF is very complex and despite the rapid advancement in pharmacological and device-based interventional therapies still, a single therapy may not be sufficient to meet the demand for coping with the diseases. Total artificial hearts (TAH) and ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been widely used clinically to assist patients with severe HF. Unfortunately, direct contact between the patient's blood and device leads to thromboembolic events, and then coagulatory factors, as well as, infection contribute significantly to complicate the situation. There is no effective treatment of HF except cardiac transplantation, however, genetic variations, tissue mismatch; differences in certain immune response and socioeconomic crisis are an important concern with cardiac transplantation suggesting an alternate bridge to transplant (BTT) or destination therapies (DT). For these reasons, researchers have turned to mechanically driven compression devices, ventricular restraint devices (VRD) and heart patches. The ASD is a combination of all operational patches and cardiac support devices (CSD) by delivering biological agents and can restrain or compress the heart.

{"title": "Hypothesis: role for ammonia neutralization in the prevention and reversal of heart failure.", "abstract": "Ammonia plays a central role in the life and death of all living organisms and has been studied for over 100 yr. Ammonia is necessary for growth and development, but it is toxic in excess, and, as a result, differing methods of ammonia neutralization have evolved. After physiological and pathological stress to the heart, tissue ammonia levels rise. Local ammonia neutralization may be inadequate, and excess ammonia may exert its toxic effects. Phenylbutyrate (PBA), which is Federal Drug Administration approved for the treatment of elevated blood ammonia in urea cycle disorders, provides an accessory pathway for ammonia excretion. Recently, PBA has also been found to prevent specific cardiomyopathies. The central theme presents the hypothesis that stress to the myocardium from a variety of environmental sources causes injury, cell death, necrosis, and ammonia production. Ammonia, if not neutralized, exerts downstream toxic effects. Here, data are presented showing that neutralization with PBA alone and PBA combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition prevent and reverse pathophysiology associated with specific cardiomyopathies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ammonia produced after myocardial injury is hypothesized to be an upstream stress contributing to the pathophysiology of heart failure, effects that may be attenuated by a documented ammonia-reducing treatment.

Current approaches to cardiac organoid engineering rely on either direct cardiac differentiation from embryoid bodies (EBs) or generation of aligned cardiac tissues from predifferentiated cardiomyocytes from monolayer hiPSCs. To experimentally model early cardiac organogenesis in vitro, our protocol combines biomaterials-based cell patterning with stem cell organoid engineering. 3D cardiac microchambers are created from 2D hiPSC colonies; these microchambers approximate an early-development heart with distinct spatial organization and self-assembly. With proper training in photolithography microfabrication, maintenance of human pluripotent stem cells, and cardiac differentiation, a graduate student with guidance will likely be able to carry out this experimental protocol, which requires \u223c3 weeks.

{"title": "Towards Bridging Translational Gap in Cardiotoxicity Prediction: an Application of Progressive Cardiac Risk Assessment Strategy in TdP Risk Assessment of Moxifloxacin.", "abstract": "Drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia, especially occurrence of torsade de pointes (TdP), has been a leading cause of attrition and post-approval re-labeling and withdrawal of many drugs. TdP is a multifactorial event, reflecting more than just drug-induced cardiac ion channel inhibition and QT interval prolongation. This presents a translational gap in extrapolating pre-clinical and clinical cardiac safety assessment to estimate TdP risk reliably, especially when the drug of interest is used in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs for treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis. A multi-scale mechanistic modeling framework consisting of physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) simulations of clinically relevant drug exposures combined with Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) models of cardiac electro-physiology could bridge this gap. We illustrate this PBPK-QST approach in cardiac risk assessment as exemplified by moxifloxacin, an anti-tuberculosis drug with abundant clinical cardiac safety data. PBPK simulations of moxifloxacin concentrations (systemic circulation and estimated in heart tissue) were linked with in vitro measurements of cardiac ion channel inhibition to predict the magnitude of QT prolongation in healthy individuals. Predictions closely reproduced the clinically observed QT interval prolongation, but no arrhythmia was observed, even at \u00d710 exposure. However, the same exposure levels in presence of physiological risk factors, e.g., hypokalemia and tachycardia, led to arrhythmic event in simulations, consistent with reported moxifloxacin-related TdP events.

The system is capable of acquiring cross-sectional images at more than 3,500 B-scans per second with sensitivities between 70dB and 90dB. The high B-scan rate enables image post-processing with nonlocal means, an advanced noise reduction algorithm that affords enhanced morphological details and reduced motion artifacts.

{"title": "Role of Toll-like receptors and interferon regulatory factors in different experimental heart failure models of diverse etiology: IRF7 as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that Tlr4, Tlr9 and Irf7 displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, Irf7 displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr6, Tlr7, Tlr9, Irf3, Irf7). With one exception, Irf3 showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified Irf7 as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-03-15", "authors": ["Peter MoritzBecher", "SvenjaHinrichs", "NinaFluschnik", "Jan KHennigs", "KarinKlingel", "StefanBlankenberg", "DirkWestermann", "DianaLindner"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0193844\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.165\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfs105\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31829e8807\n10.1503/cmaj.111958\n10.1093/eurjhf/hft064\n10.1161/RES.0b013e3182582523\n10.1155/2016/2538263\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn043\n10.1038/nri1391\n10.1155/2012/181394\n10.1038/cddis.2016.140\n10.1172/JCI6709\n10.4049/jimmunol.1002029\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.880187\n10.1152/ajpheart.00948.2011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00328.2013\n10.1155/2017/6590609\n10.1128/JVI.00047-08\n10.1016/S1053-2498(03)00106-2\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000604\n10.2337/db08-0329\n10.3892/ijmm.2013.1368\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.183913\n10.1007/s00395-012-0308-y\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1074/mcp.O111.014704\n10.1038/nature13302\n10.2337/db08-0564\n10.5551/jat.27292\n10.1189/jlb.0306164\n10.1038/ni.1863\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00614\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.584532\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136824.73458.20\n10.1038/74689\n10.1016/j.thromres.2014.03.011\n10.1016/j.ahj.2007.05.010\n10.1038/35099560\n10.1093/emboj/17.22.6660\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000505\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.04.030\n10.1152/ajpheart.00995.2008\n10.2174/157340309788970405\n10.1016/j.thromres.2017.07.031\n10.1155/2013/828354\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.10.006\n10.1007/s00395-012-0326-9\n10.1155/2014/847827\n10.1172/JCI28898\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e32832fa5c4\n10.2337/dc09-1799\n10.1152/ajpendo.00302.2006\n10.1097/MED.0b013e3283073a46\n10.1002/dmrr.1256\n10.1152/ajpendo.00505.2012\n10.3317/jraas.2003.030\n10.1159/000218173"}
{"title": "Cardioprotection of tilianin ameliorates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury: Role of the apoptotic signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-03-15", "authors": ["ChengZeng", "WenJiang", "RuifangZheng", "ChenghuiHe", "JianguangLi", "JianguoXing"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0193845\n10.1002/cphy.c160006\n10.3945/ajcn.114.095117\n10.7555/JBR.28.20140037\n10.1038/srep09858\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168219\n10.1186/s13287-015-0134-x\n10.1016/j.lfs.2011.01.019\n10.1007/s10495-015-1174-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144733\n10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.029\n10.1016/j.jep.2012.03.028\n10.1007/s12012-013-9221-3\n10.4103/0973-1296.141817\n10.1002/ptr.5494\n10.1155/2015/974039\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.07.023\n10.1016/j.ejps.2016.02.007\n10.2147/IJN.S131893\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2954\n10.1016/j.jep.2017.05.028\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.08.023\n10.1155/2015/481405\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189307\n10.1111/bph.13130\n10.1007/s11010-013-1918-x\n10.1159/000369716\n10.1007/s12272-009-1709-9\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2015.08.010\n10.1111/jpi.12272\n10.1159/000330068\n10.1159/000443080\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2008.00052.x\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.10.067\n10.1155/2016/1232103\n10.1159/000374035"}

Cell therapy trials for HF have demonstrated excellent safety and encouraging results, but current rates of myocardial recovery after LVAD implantation are limited. Early trials combining these 2 therapies to increase the likelihood of recovery and to potentially obviate the need for subsequent transplantation appear promising. Additionally, the application of cell therapy to patients undergoing LVAD implantation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation creates an opportunity to examine cardiac tissue before and after treatment and to study the mechanism of benefit.

We highlight clinical trials using stem cell therapy for end-stage HF most relevant to an LVAD patient population and comprehensively review the preclinical and clinical studies of combined stem cell therapy and long-term mechanical circulatory support.

{"title": "[Lacosamide associated with high-degree block in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia].", "abstract": "Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug whose exact mechanism of action remains unknown. It acts by increasing the slow inactivation of the voltage-dependent sodium channels of the cell membranes. It is indicated in the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation and is occasionally used as adjunct treatment in neuropathic pain. Although the most frequent side effects are mild (dizziness, diplopia, blurred vision, headache, tremor, etc.), others such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, changes in repolarisation, atrioventricular blocks and even cardiac arrest or sudden death have been reported.\nA 74-year-old male, diagnosed with classic trigeminal neuralgia treated with 200 mg/12 h of carbamazepine, who visited due to a worsening of the pain in the trigeminal V1-V2 region. On the sixth day after admission, after adjusting the carbamazepine treatment to a descending regime, 400 mg/24 h of eslicarbazepine and 100 mg/12 h of intravenous lacosamide, he presented a complete atrioventricular block with extreme bradycardia that required the placement of a pacemaker.\nVoltage-dependent sodium channel blockade mainly affects non-sinusal cardiac tissue. An alteration in the atrioventricular or infrahisian node is more consistent with its mechanism of action. Other cases of atrioventricular block in this kind of polytherapy have been reported. Precaution is advised in the concomitant use of antiepileptic drugs, above all among those that prolong the PR interval, and they should be contraindicated in patients with a history of atrioventricular block, ischaemic heart disease or heart failure. Before starting, a baseline electrocardiogram and regular electrocardiographic monitoring are advised during the first few weeks.\nLacosamida asociada a bloqueo de alto grado en un paciente con neuralgia del trigemino.\nIntroduccion. La lacosamida es un farmaco antiepileptico cuyo mecanismo de accion exacto se desconoce. Actua aumentando la inactivacion lenta de los canales de sodio dependientes del voltaje de las membranas celulares. Indicado en el tratamiento de crisis focales con o sin generalizacion secundaria, ocasionalmente se emplea como tratamiento coadyuvante en el dolor neuropatico. Aunque los efectos adversos mas frecuentes son leves (mareo, diplopia, vision borrosa, cefalea, temblor\u2026), se han descrito taquiarritmias supraventriculares, cambios en la repolarizacion, bloqueos auriculoventriculares e incluso parada cardiaca o muerte subita.

In this study, the relationship between miR-17-5p and cardiac function was researched. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were infected with adenoviruses. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-7AAD/PI. Real-time RT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-17-5p and ERK levels. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of ERK, the anti-apoptosis protein bcl-2 and apoptosis proteins, including bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9. An in vivo acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was established in SD male rats. Heart function was evaluated by echocardiography prior to inducing AMI and after 7 and 28 days later. The heart was removed to perform histological examination, real-time RT-PCR, and western blotting, as described above. The result indicated that the ERK pathway was activated by miR-17-5p downregulation and an increase in the level of the anti-apoptosis protein bcl-2; however, the levels of apoptosis proteins (bax/caspase 3/caspase 9) were decreased. The results were completely reversed when miR-17-5p was up-regulated. At 7 and 28 days after the induction of AMI, in the miR-17-5p inhibition group, the infarction areas and collagen fibers were decreased, apoptosis in cardiac tissues was inhibited, and the endothelial growth process was promoted.

{"title": "Physiology of Cardiac Development: From Genetics to Signaling to Therapeutic Strategies.", "abstract": "The heart is one of the first organs to form and function during embryonic development. It is comprised of multiple cell lineages, each integral for proper cardiac development, and include cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, epicardial cells and neural crest cells. The molecular mechanisms regulating cardiac development and morphogenesis are dependent on signaling crosstalk between multiple lineages through paracrine interactions, cell-ECM interactions, and cell-cell interactions, which together, help facilitate survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cardiac tissue. Aberrant regulation of any of these processes can induce developmental disorders and pathological phenotypes. Here, we will discuss each of these processes, the genetic factors that contribute to each step of cardiac development, as well as the current and future therapeutic targets and mechanisms of heart development and disease.

{"title": "Nitrite exerts antioxidant effects, inhibits the mTOR pathway and reverses hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a common consequence of chronic hypertension and leads to heart failure and premature death. The anion nitrite is now considered as a bioactive molecule able to exert beneficial cardiovascular effects. Previous results showed that nitrite attenuates hypertension-induced increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the vasculature. Whether antioxidant effects induced by nitrite block critical signaling pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy induced by hypertension has not been determined yet. The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is responsible to activate protein synthesis during cardiac remodeling and is activated by increased ROS production, which is commonly found in hypertension. Here, we investigated the effects of nitrite treatment on cardiac remodeling and activation of this hypertrophic signaling pathway in 2 kidney-1 clip (2K1C) hypertension. Sham and 2K1C rats were treated with oral nitrite at 1 or 15\u202fmg/kg for four weeks. Nitrite treatment (15\u202fmg/kg) reduced systolic blood pressure and decreased ROS production in the heart tissue from hypertensive rats. This nitrite dose also blunted hypertension-induced activation of mTOR pathway and cardiac hypertrophy. While the lower nitrite dose (1\u202fmg/kg) did not affect blood pressure, it exerted antioxidant effects and tended to attenuate mTOR pathway activation and cardiac hypertrophy induced by hypertension. Our findings provide strong evidence that nitrite treatment decreases cardiac remodeling induced by hypertension as a result of its antioxidant effects and downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway. This study may help to establish nitrite as an effective therapy in hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophic remodeling.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2018-03-14", "authors": ["Danielle AGuimaraes", "Madla ADos Passos", "ElenRizzi", "Lucas CPinheiro", "Jefferson HAmaral", "Raquel FGerlach", "Michele MCastro", "Jose ETanus-Santos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.03.006"}

Up-regulation of miR-223 in vivo protected the mice against CVB3-induced myocardial injuries characterized by the increased body weight and survival, enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), relieved inflammation, depressed creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, reduced production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-\u202f6 as well as increased IL-10. We subsequently found that miR-233 up-regulation significantly suppressed the expression of M1 markers (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and CD 86), and promoted the expression of M2 markers (Arginase-1, Fizz-1 and CD 206) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-223 directly targeted Pknox1 to inhibit its expression, and the expression of Pknox1 was inversely correlated with miR-223 expression in heart tissues and heart-infiltrating macrophages of CVB3-infected mice. Gain-of-function analyses indicated that Pknox1 overexpression partially reversed the polarization phenotypes regulated by miR-223 overexpression. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-223 protects against CVB3-induced inflammation and myocardial damage, which may partly attribute to the regulation of macrophage polarization via targeting Pknox1.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2018-03-11", "authors": ["WeihuiGou", "ZhenZhang", "ChunfengYang", "YumeiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.03.004"}

We demonstrate the use of Intensify3D for analyzing cholinergic interneurons of adult murine brains in 2-Photon and Light-Sheet fluorescence microscopy, as well as of mammary gland and heart tissues. Beyond enhancement in 3D visualization in all samples tested, in 2-Photon in vivo images, this tool corrected errors in feature extraction of cortical interneurons; and in Light-Sheet microscopy, it enabled identification of individual cortical barrel fields and quantification of somata in cleared adult brains.

Although a number of circRNAs have been identified by bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data, tissue and disease-specific circRNAs are still to be uncovered to promote their application in basic research and clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to explore the circRNA profiles in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and to identify cardiac or disease-specific circRNAs.\nhiPSCs were generated from fibroblasts, and then further differentiated to hiPSC-CMs by modulating WNT signaling in RPMI+B27 medium. Following high-throughput RNA sequencing, circRNAs were extracted and quantified by a combined strategy known as CIRCexplorer. Integrative analysis was performed to illuminate the correlation between circRNAs and their parental linear isoforms. Cardiac and disease-specific expression of circRNAs was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.\nIn this study, a total of 5602 circRNAs were identified in hiPSCs and hiPSC-CMs. Our data indicated, for the first time, more enriched expression of circRNAs in differentiated cardiomyocytes than in undifferentiated hiPSCs. In addition to the host gene-dependent expression, our integrative analysis also identified a number of circRNAs showing host gene-independent expression in hiPSCs and hiPSC-CMs. CircRNAs including circSLC8A1, circCACNA1D, circSPHKAP and circALPK2 showed cardiac-selective expression during cardiac differentiation and human heart-specific enrichment in fetal tissues. Furthermore, circSLC8A1 abnormally increased in heart tissues from patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy.\nCircRNAs are highly enriched in hiPSC-differentiated CMs, and cardiac-specific circRNAs such as circSLC8A1, circCACNA1D, circSPHKAP and circALPK2 may serve as biomarkers of CMs. Detection of the excessive expression of circSLC8A1 provides a potential approach for pathological status indication of heart disease.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2018-03-11", "authors": ["WeiLei", "TingtingFeng", "XingFang", "YouYu", "JunjieYang", "Zhen-AoZhao", "JunweiLiu", "ZhenyaShen", "WenboDeng", "ShijunHu"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-018-0793-5\n10.1373/clinchem.2009.125369\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.05.008\n10.1172/JCI80575\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.11.009\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.115.001264\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013303\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303549\n10.1038/srep34985\n10.2217/epi.16.3\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.07.007\n10.1016/j.gpb.2016.02.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.06.015\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.006\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.10.010\n10.1002/stem.1278\n10.1261/rna.043687.113\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.03.027\n10.1038/srep08057\n10.1093/nar/gkw075\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.014\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00355\n10.1186/1878-5085-4-7\n10.1038/nbt.2890\n10.1093/nar/gkv1367\n10.1016/j.cca.2015.02.018\n10.3233/CBM-150552\n10.1186/s12979-015-0042-z\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx501.P440\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141214"}

The pathological changes in cardiopulmonary tissue in rats were observed with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) strain, and the pathological score of lung injury was calculated.\nThere was no animal death in NS control group. In LPS model group, there were 3 rats dead at 6 hours, and 4 dead at 12 hours.

This review will focus on the role that CaSR plays in vascular and cardiac tissues. In the vasculature, CaSR is expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. CaSR of endothelial cells participates in part to the regulation of local perfusion by linkage of CaSR activation to endothelial hyperpolarization and nitric oxide release. CaSR of smooth muscle cells is involved in the control of proliferation. In the pulmonary vasculature, however, CaSR participates in the onset of pulmonary hypertension, making CaSR antagonism a therapeutic option in this case. In the heart, CaSR is expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and myoyctes, contributing to normal cardiac function and composition of extracellular matrix. More important, activation of CaSR may participate in the cardiac protective effects of ischaemic pre-conditioning.

Furthermore, the top DEGs were further validated using quantitative PCR in the hypertrophic heart tissue induced by isoprenaline. A total of 113 common DEGs with absolute fold change > 0.5, including 60 significantly upregulated DEGs and 53 downregulated DEGs, were obtained. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis suggested that common upregulated DEG were mainly enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis, extracellular fibril organization, and cell proliferation; and the common downregulated genes were significantly enriched in ion transport, endoplasmic reticulum, and dendritic spine. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis found that the common DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix receptor interaction, phagosome, and focal adhesion. Additionally, the expression of Mfap4, Ltbp2, Aspn, Serpina3n, and Cnksr1 were upregulated in the model of CH, while the expression of Anp32a was downregulated.

The maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development was significantly increased in the HMNV group compared with in the other groups. Systolic left ventricular pressure was significantly changed in all groups.

The application of volume EM techniques can give insight into the three-dimensional (3-D) organization of complex biological structures. In this study, we generated 3-D datasets using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM), the latter resulting in datasets with 5\u00a0nm isotropic voxels. We visualized cardiomyocytes in murine ventricular heart tissue and, for the first time, we could three-dimensionally reconstruct the ID including desmosomes and GJs with 5\u00a0nm precision in a large volume. Results show in three dimensions a highly folded structure of the ID, with the presence of GJs and desmosomes in both plicae and interplicae regions. We observed close contact of GJs with mitochondria and a variable spatial distribution of the junctions. Based on measurements of the shape of the intercellular junctions in 3-D, it is seen that GJs and desmosomes vary in size, depending on the region within the ID.

{"title": "Featured Article: TGF-\u03b21 dominates extracellular matrix rigidity for inducing differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibroblasts and their activated derivatives, myofibroblasts, play a critical role in wound healing after myocardial injury and often contribute to long-term pathological outcomes, such as excessive fibrosis. Thus, defining the microenvironmental factors that regulate the phenotype of cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts could lead to new therapeutic strategies. Both chemical and biomechanical cues have previously been shown to induce myofibroblast differentiation in many organs and species. For example, transforming growth factor beta 1, a cytokine secreted by neutrophils, and rigid extracellular matrix environments have both been shown to promote differentiation. However, the relative contributions of transforming growth factor beta 1 and extracellular matrix rigidity, two hallmark cues in many pathological myocardial microenvironments, to the phenotype of human cardiac fibroblasts are unclear. We hypothesized that transforming growth factor beta 1 and rigid extracellular matrix environments would potentially have a synergistic effect on the differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. To test this, we seeded primary human adult cardiac fibroblasts onto coverslips coated with polydimethylsiloxane of various elastic moduli, introduced transforming growth factor beta 1, and longitudinally quantified cell phenotype by measuring expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, the most robust indicator of myofibroblasts. Our data indicate that, although extracellular matrix rigidity influenced differentiation after one day of transforming growth factor beta 1 treatment, ultimately transforming growth factor beta 1 superseded extracellular matrix rigidity as the primary regulator of myofibroblast differentiation. We also measured expression of POSTN, FAP, and FSP1, proposed secondary indicators of fibroblast/myofibroblast phenotypes. Although these genes partially trended with \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression, they were relatively inconsistent. Finally, we demonstrated that activated myofibroblasts incompletely revert to a fibroblast phenotype after they are re-plated onto new surfaces without transforming growth factor beta 1, suggesting differentiation is partially reversible. Our results provide new insights into how microenvironmental cues affect human cardiac fibroblast differentiation in the context of myocardial pathology, which is important for identifying effective therapeutic targets and dictating supporting cell phenotypes for engineered human cardiac disease models. Impact statement Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Many forms of heart disease are associated with fibrosis, which increases extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity and compromises cardiac output. Fibrotic tissue is synthesized primarily by myofibroblasts differentiated from fibroblasts. Thus, defining the cues that regulate myofibroblast differentiation is important for understanding the mechanisms of fibrosis. However, previous studies have focused on non-human cardiac fibroblasts and have not tested combinations of chemical and mechanical cues. We tested the effects of TGF-\u03b21, a cytokine secreted by immune cells after injury, and ECM rigidity on the differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Our results indicate that differentiation is initially influenced by ECM rigidity, but is ultimately superseded by TGF-\u03b21. This suggests that targeting TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in cardiac fibroblasts may have therapeutic potential for attenuating fibrosis, even in rigid microenvironments. Additionally, our approach can be leveraged to engineer more precise multi-cellular human cardiac tissue models.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2018-03-06", "authors": ["NathanCho", "Shadi ERazipour", "Megan LMcCain"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370218761628"}

Fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, lipid profile, creatine kinase-MB ((CK-MB)), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and markers of oxidative stress were measured by spectrophotometric methods while (U-II) and UTR gene expression was determined by qPCR method. SMN significantly reduced the FBS level, increased the concentration of insulin and improved HOMA-IR. SMN prevented diabetes-induced weight loss, and attenuated the increased levels of total oxidative status (TOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO). Diabetes-induced reduction of total thiol molecules content (TTM) was normalized to the normal level in SMN treated rats. SMN significantly modulated serum lipid profile, reduced the expression of (U-II) and UTR in the heart, and improved histopathological changes in the heart tissues. Therefore, the current study indicated that SMN ameliorated unpleasant diabetic characteristics via down-regulation of (U-II) and UTR gene expression and modulation of oxidative stress in the heart tissue of type 2 diabetic rats.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-03-02", "authors": ["RahimehRahimi", "JamshidKarimi", "IrajKhodadadi", "HeidarTayebinia", "NejatKheiripour", "MohammadHashemnia", "FatemehGoli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.02.075"}

However, patient receiving DOX-therapy, myelosuppression and genotoxicity which may lead to secondary malignancy and dose dependent cardiotoxicity is an imperative adverse effect. Mechanisms behind the DOX-induced toxicities are increased level of oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis. Therefore, in search of a potential chemoprotectant, naturally occurring glucosinolate breakdown product Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) was evaluated against DOX-induced toxicities in Swiss albino mice. DOX was administered (5\u202fmg/kg b.w., i.p.) and I3C was administered (20\u202fmg/kg b.w., p.o.) in concomitant and 15 days pretreatment schedule. Results of the present study showed that I3C appreciably mitigated DOX-induced chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei formation, DNA damage and apoptosis in bone marrow niche. Histopathological observations revealed that DOX-intoxication resulted in massive structural and functional impairment of heart and bone marrow niche. However, oral administration of I3C significantly attenuated DOX-induced oxidative stress in the cardiac tissues as evident from decreased levels of ROS/RNS and lipid peroxidation, and by increased level of glutathione (reduced) and the activity of phase-II antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, administration of I3C significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) stimulated Nrf2-mediated activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway and promoted expression of cytoprotective proteins heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and GST\u03c0 in bone marrow and cardiac tissues. In connection with that, I3C significantly attenuated DOX-induced inflammation by downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, viz., NF-k\u03b2(p50), iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6 expression. Moreover, I3C attenuate DOX-induced apoptosis by up-regulation of Bcl2 and down-regulation of Bax and caspase-3 expression in bone marrow cells. Thus, this study suggests that I3C has promising chemoprotective efficacy against DOX-induced toxicities and indicates its future use as an adjuvant in chemotherapy.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-03-02", "authors": ["SubhadipHajra", "Arup RanjanPatra", "AbhishekBasu", "SudinBhattacharya"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.02.088"}

{"title": "Systems analysis of dilated cardiomyopathy in the next generation sequencing era.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a form of severe failure of cardiac muscle caused by a long list of etiologies ranging from myocardial infarction, DNA mutations in cardiac genes, to toxics. Systems analysis integrating next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based omics approaches, such as the sequencing of DNA, RNA, and chromatin, provide valuable insights into DCM mechanisms. The outcome and interpretation of NGS methods can be affected by the localization of cardiac biopsy, level of tissue degradation, and variable ratios of different cell populations, especially in the presence of fibrosis. Heart tissue composition may even differ between sexes, or siblings carrying the same disease causing mutation. Therefore, before planning any experiments, it is important to fully appreciate the complexities of DCM, and the selection of samples suitable for given research question should be an interdisciplinary effort involving clinicians and biologists. The list of NGS omics datasets in DCM to date is short. More studies have to be performed to contribute to public data repositories and facilitate systems analysis. In addition, proper data integration is a difficult task requiring complex computational approaches. Despite these complications, there are multiple promising implications of systems analysis in DCM. By combining various types of datasets, for example, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, or 4C, deep insights into cardiac biology, and possible biomarkers and treatment targets, can be gained. Systems analysis can also facilitate the annotation of noncoding mutations in cardiac-specific DNA regulatory regions that play a substantial role in maintaining the tissue- and cell-specific transcriptional programs in the heart.

The aim of this study was to illuminate whether TXL can improve hypercholesterolemia-impaired heart function by protecting artery endothelial function and increasing microvascular density (MVD) in heart. Furthermore, we will explore the underlying molecular mechanism of TXL cardiovascular protection.\nAfter intragastric administration of TXL (0.1 ml/10 g body weight) to C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n = 8) and ApoE-/- mice (n = 8), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood glucose levels in serum were measured. The parameters of heart rate (HR), left ventricular diastolic end diameter, and left ventricular systolic end diameter were harvested by ultrasonic cardiogram. The left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output, and left ventricular fractional shortening were calculated. Meanwhile, aorta peak systolic flow velocity (PSV), end diastolic flow velocity, and mean flow velocity (MFV) were measured. The pulsatility index (PI) and resistant index were calculated in order to evaluate the vascular elasticity and resistance. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was evaluated by relaxation of aortic rings in response to acetylcholine. Western blotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed for protein and gene analyses of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemical detection was performed for myocardial CD34 expression. Data in this study were compared by one-way analysis of variance between groups. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nAlthough there was no significant decrease of cholesterol level (F = 2.300, P = 0.240), TXL inhibited the level of triglyceride and VLDL (F = 9.209, P = 0.024 and F = 9.786, P = 0.020, respectively) in ApoE-/- mice.

The fetal inflammatory response syndrome describes elevations in the fetal interleukin-6 level, which is a marker for inflammation and fetal organ injury. An understanding of the effects of inflammation on fetal cardiac development may lead to insight into the fetal origins of adult cardiovascular disease.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the fetal inflammatory response syndrome is associated with disruptions in gene networks that program fetal cardiac development.\nWe obtained fetal cardiac tissue after necropsy from a well-described pregnant nonhuman primate model (pigtail macaque, Macaca nemestrina) of intrauterine infection (n=5) and controls (n=5). Cases with the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (fetal plasma interleukin-6 >11 pg/mL) were induced by either choriodecidual inoculation of a hypervirulent group B streptococcus strain (n=4) or intraamniotic inoculation of Escherichia coli (n=1). RNA and protein were extracted from fetal hearts and profiled by microarray and Luminex (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for cytokine analysis, respectively. Results were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Statistical and bioinformatics analyses included single gene analysis, gene set analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and Wilcoxon rank sum.\nSevere fetal inflammation developed in the context of intraamniotic infection and a disseminated bacterial infection in the fetus. Interleukin-6 and -8 in fetal cardiac tissues were elevated significantly in fetal inflammatory response syndrome cases vs controls (P<.05). A total of 609 probe sets were expressed differentially (>1.5-fold change, P<.05) in the fetal heart (analysis of variance). Altered expression of select genes was validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that included several with known functions in cardiac injury, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling (eg, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2, STEAP family member 4, natriuretic peptide A, and secreted frizzled-related protein 4; all P<.05). Multiple gene sets and pathways that are involved in cardiac morphogenesis and vasculogenesis were downregulated significantly by gene set and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (hallmark transforming growth factor beta signaling, cellular morphogenesis during differentiation, morphology of cardiovascular system; all P<.05).\nDisruption of gene networks for cardiac morphogenesis and vasculogenesis occurred in the preterm fetal heart of nonhuman primates with preterm labor, intraamniotic infection, and severe fetal inflammation.

However, it has not previously been possible to visualize the three-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics of scroll waves inside cardiac tissues. Here we show that three-dimensional mechanical scroll waves and filament-like phase singularities can be observed deep inside the contracting heart wall using high-resolution four-dimensional ultrasound-based strain imaging. We found that mechanical phase singularities co-exist with electrical phase singularities during cardiac fibrillation. We investigated the dynamics of electrical and mechanical phase singularities by simultaneously measuring the membrane potential, intracellular calcium concentration and mechanical contractions of the heart. We show that cardiac fibrillation can be characterized using the three-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics of mechanical phase singularities, which arise inside the fibrillating contracting ventricular wall. We demonstrate that electrical and mechanical phase singularities show complex interactions and we characterize their dynamics in terms of trajectories, topological charge and lifetime. We anticipate that our findings will provide novel perspectives for non-invasive diagnostic imaging and therapeutic applications.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2018-02-22", "authors": ["JChristoph", "MChebbok", "CRichter", "JSchr\u00f6der-Schetelig", "PBittihn", "SStein", "IUzelac", "F HFenton", "GHasenfu\u00df", "R FGilmour", "SLuther"], "doi": "10.1038/nature26001"}
{"title": "Electrospun Gelatin\u207bChondroitin Sulfate Scaffolds Loaded with Platelet Lysate Promote Immature Cardiomyocyte Proliferation.", "abstract": "The aim of the present work was the development of heart patches based on gelatin (G) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) to be used as implants to improve heart recovery after corrective surgery for critical congenital heart defects (CHD). Patches were prepared by means of electrospinning to obtain nanofibrous scaffolds and they were loaded with platelet lysate (PL) as a source of growth factors to further enhance the repair process. Scaffolds were characterized for morphology and mechanical properties and for the capability to support in vitro adhesion and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts in order to assess the system's general biocompatibility. Adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells and cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts from rat fetuses) onto PL-loaded patches was evaluated. Patches presented good elasticity and high stiffness suitable for in vivo adaptation to heart contraction. CS improved adhesion and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts, as proof of their biocompatibility. Moreover, they enhanced the adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells, a crucial mediator of cardiac repair. Cell adhesion and proliferation could be related to elastic properties, which could favor cell motility. The presence of platelet lysate and CS was crucial for the adhesion and proliferation of cardiac cells and, in particular, of cardiomyocytes: G/CS scaffold embedded with PL appeared to selectively promote proliferation in cardiomyocytes but not cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, G/CS scaffold seems to be a promising system to assist myocardial-repair processes in young patient, preserving cardiomyocyte viability and preventing cardiac fibroblast proliferation, likely reducing subsequent uncontrolled collagen deposition by fibroblasts following repair.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2018-02-21", "authors": ["FrancescaSaporito", "GiuseppinaSandri", "Maria CristinaBonferoni", "SilviaRossi", "LorenzoMalavasi", "Claudia DelFante", "BarbaraVigani", "LaurenBlack", "FrancaFerrari"], "doi": "10.3390/polym10020208\n10.1542/peds.2012-3435\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002043\n10.1016/j.tcm.2017.06.013\n10.1186/s13019-016-0559-z\n10.1002/adhm.201600549\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.035\n10.1002/adhm.201500035\n10.1007/s11886-017-0826-1\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000135591.37759.AF\n10.1080/00914037.2016.1180616\n10.1134/S0965545X17040058\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0017\n10.1002/adhm.201600571\n10.1002/jbm.b.30096\n10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.008\n10.1007/s10967-007-7003-8\n10.2174/157016308786733564\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.12.059\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.05.045\n10.1007/s10495-016-1292-8\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.05.032\n10.1002/app.42115\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.066\n10.1007/s13367-013-0023-8\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.04.020\n10.4191/KCERS.2008.45.1.573\n10.5713/ajas.15.0784\n10.2147/IJN.S28753\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.010\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1002/smll.201702677\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.08.004\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.06.012\n10.1177/1074248414528576\n10.1208/s12249-011-9649-3"}

These conditions are known to trigger the symptoms of electrical diseases in patients carrying sodium channel mutations. Protons cause a diverse set of changes to sodium channel gating, which generally lead to decreases in the amplitude of the transient sodium current and increases in the fraction of non-inactivating channels that pass persistent currents. These effects are shared with disease-causing mutants in neuronal, skeletal muscle, and cardiac tissue and may be compounded in mutants that impart greater proton sensitivity to sodium channels, suggesting a role of protons in triggering acute symptoms of electrical disease.In this chapter, we review the mechanisms of proton block of the sodium channel pore and a suggested mode of action by which protons alter channel gating. We discuss the available data on isoform specificity of proton effects and tissue level effects.

Pharmacological treatments of this condition are focused on heart rate control, rhythm control and reduction in risk of stroke. Selective ablation of cardiac tissues resulting in isolation of areas causing atrial fibrillation is another treatment strategy which can be delivered by two minimally invasive interventions: percutaneous catheter ablation and thoracoscopic surgical ablation. The main purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of these two interventions.\nCatheter Ablation versus Thoracoscopic Surgical Ablation in Long Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (CASA-AF) is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial within three NHS tertiary cardiovascular centres specialising in treatment of atrial fibrillation. Eligible adults (n\u2009=\u2009120) with symptomatic, long-standing, persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomly allocated to either catheter ablation or thoracoscopic ablation in a 1:1 ratio. Pre-determined lesion sets will be delivered in each treatment arm with confirmation of appropriate conduction block. All patients will have an implantable loop recorder (ILR) inserted subcutaneously immediately following ablation to enable continuous heart rhythm monitoring for at least 12\u00a0months. The devices will be programmed to detect episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia \u2265\u200930\u00a0s in duration. The patients will be followed for 12\u00a0months, completing appropriate clinical assessments and questionnaires every 3\u00a0months. The ILR data will be wirelessly transmitted daily and evaluated every month for the duration of the follow-up. The primary endpoint in the study is freedom from atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia at the end of the follow-up period.\nThe CASA-AF Trial is a National Institute for Health Research-funded study that will provide first-class evidence on the comparative efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of thoracoscopic surgical ablation and conventional percutaneous catheter ablation for long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. In addition, the results of the trial will provide information on the effects on patients' quality of life.\nISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN18250790 .

Optical mapping of the intact heart was adopted to study the effects of HuR on the conduction velocity and action potential upstroke in mice with myocardial infarct and HF after injection of AAV9 viral particles carrying HuR.\nHuR was associated with SCN5A mRNA in cardiomyocytes, and expression of HuR was downregulated in failing hearts. The association of HuR and SCN5A mRNA protected SCN5A mRNA from decay. Injection of AAV9 viral particles carrying HuR increased SCN5A expression in mouse heart tissues after MI. Optical mapping of the intact heart demonstrated that overexpression of HuR improved action potential upstroke and conduction velocity in the infarct border zone, which reduced the risk of reentrant arrhythmia after MI.\nOur data indicate that HuR is an important RNA-binding protein in maintaining SCN5A mRNA abundance in cardiomyocytes. Reduced expression of HuR may be at least partially responsible for the downregulation of SCN5A mRNA expression in ischemic HF.

However, its applications remain limited because the cardiac tissue is a highly organized structure with unique physiologic, biomechanical, and electrical properties. In this study, we undertook a proof-of-concept study to develop a contractile cardiac tissue with cellular organization, uniformity, and scalability by using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting strategy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from infant rat hearts and suspended in a fibrin-based bioink to determine the priting capability for cardiac tissue engineering. This cell-laden hydrogel was sequentially printed with a sacrificial hydrogel and a supporting polymeric frame through a 300-\u00b5m nozzle by pressured air. Bioprinted cardiac tissue constructs had a spontaneous synchronous contraction in culture, implying in vitro cardiac tissue development and maturation. Progressive cardiac tissue development was confirmed by immunostaining for \u03b1-actinin and connexin 43, indicating that cardiac tissues were formed with uniformly aligned, dense, and electromechanically coupled cardiac cells. These constructs exhibited physiologic responses to known cardiac drugs regarding beating frequency and contraction forces. In addition, Notch signaling blockade significantly accelerated development and maturation of bioprinted cardiac tissues. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of bioprinting functional cardiac tissues that could be used for tissue engineering applications and pharmaceutical purposes.\nCardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the United States and a major health-care burden. Myocardial infarction (MI) is a main cause of death in cardiovascular diseases. MI occurs as a consequence of sudden blocking of blood vessels supplying the heart. When occlusions in the coronary arteries occur, an immediate decrease in nutrient and oxygen supply to the cardiac muscle, resulting in permanent cardiac cell death. Eventually, scar tissue formed in the damaged cardiac muscle that cannot conduct electrical or mechanical stimuli thus leading to a reduction in the pumping efficiency of the heart. The therapeutic options available for end-stage heart failure is to undergo heart transplantation or the use of mechanical ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, many patients die while being on a waiting list, due to the organ shortage and limitation of VADs, such as surgical complications, infection, thrombogenesis, and failure of the electrical motor and hemolysis. Ultimately, 3D bioprinting strategy aims to create clinically applicable tissue constructs that can be immediately implanted in the body.

{"title": "The HCM-linked W792R mutation in cardiac myosin-binding protein C reduces C6 FnIII domain stability.", "abstract": "Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a functional sarcomeric protein that regulates contractility in response to contractile demand, and many mutations in cMyBP-C lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To gain insight into the effects of disease-causing cMyBP-C missense mutations on contractile function, we expressed the pathogenic W792R mutation (substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan residue by an arginine residue at position 792) in mouse cardiomyocytes lacking endogenous cMyBP-C and studied the functional effects using three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue constructs (mECTs). Based on complete conservation of tryptophan at this location in fibronectin type II (FnIII) domains, we hypothesized that the W792R mutation affects folding of the C6 FnIII domain, destabilizing the mutant protein. Adenoviral transduction of wild-type (WT) and W792R cDNA achieved equivalent mRNA transcript abundance, but not equivalent protein levels, with W792R compared with WT controls. mECTs expressing W792R demonstrated abnormal contractile kinetics compared with WT mECTs that were nearly identical to cMyBP-C-deficient mECTs. We studied whether common pathways of protein degradation were responsible for the rapid degradation of W792R cMyBP-C. Inhibition of both ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal degradation pathways failed to increase full-length mutant protein abundance to WT equivalence, suggesting rapid cytosolic degradation. Bacterial expression of WT and W792R protein fragments demonstrated decreased mutant stability with altered thermal denaturation and increased susceptibility to trypsin digestion. These data suggest that the W792R mutation destabilizes the C6 FnIII domain of cMyBP-C, resulting in decreased full-length protein expression. This study highlights the vulnerability of FnIII-like domains to mutations that alter domain stability and further indicates that missense mutations in cMyBP-C can cause disease through a mechanism of haploinsufficiency.

Activation of GHSR1a by ghrelin promotes cardiomyocyte contractility and survival, and changes in myocardial GHSR1a and circulating ghrelin track with end-stage heart failure, leading to the hypothesis that GHSR1a is a biomarker for heart failure. We hypothesized that GHSR1a could also be a biomarker for diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). We used two models of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DCM: group 1, adult mice treated with 35 mg/kg STZ for 3 days; and group 2, neonatal mice treated with 70 mg/kg STZ at days 2 and 5 after birth. In group 1, mild fasting hyperglycemia (11 mM) was first detected 8 weeks after the last injection, and in group 2, severe fasting hyperglycemia (20 mM) was first detected 1 to 3 weeks after the last injection. In group 1, left ventricular function was slightly impaired as measured by echocardiography, and Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in myocardial GHSR1a. In group 2, GHSR1a levels were also decreased as assessed by Cy5-ghrelin(1-19) fluorescence microscopy, and there was a significant negative correlation between GHSR1a levels and glucose tolerance.

{"title": "Exosomal microRNA-21-5p Mediates Mesenchymal Stem Cell Paracrine Effects on Human Cardiac Tissue Contractility.", "abstract": "The promising clinical benefits of delivering human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for treating heart disease warrant a better understanding of underlying mechanisms of action. hMSC exosomes increase myocardial contractility; however, the exosomal cargo responsible for these effects remains unresolved.\nThis study aims to identify lead cardioactive hMSC exosomal microRNAs to provide a mechanistic basis for optimizing future stem cell-based cardiotherapies.\nIntegrating systems biology and human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) technologies, partial least squares regression analysis of exosomal microRNA profiling data predicted microRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) levels positively correlate with contractile force and calcium handling gene expression responses in hECTs treated with conditioned media from multiple cell types. Furthermore, miR-21-5p levels were significantly elevated in hECTs treated with the exosome-enriched fraction of the hMSC secretome (hMSC-exo) versus untreated controls. This motivated experimentally testing the human-specific role of miR-21-5p in hMSC-exo-mediated increases of cardiac tissue contractility. Treating hECTs with miR-21-5p alone was sufficient to recapitulate effects observed with hMSC-exo on hECT developed force and expression of associated calcium handling genes (eg, SERCA2a and L-type calcium channel). Conversely, knockdown of miR-21-5p in hMSCs significantly diminished exosomal procontractile and associated calcium handling gene expression effects on hECTs. Western blots supported miR-21-5p effects on calcium handling gene expression at the protein level, corresponding to significantly increased calcium transient amplitude and decreased decay time constant in comparison to miR-scramble control. Mechanistically, cotreating with miR-21-5p and LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suppressed these effects. Finally, mathematical simulations predicted the translational capacity for miR-21-5p treatment to restore calcium handling in mature ischemic adult human cardiomyocytes.\nmiR-21-5p plays a key role in hMSC-exo-mediated effects on cardiac contractility and calcium handling, likely via PI3K signaling.

{"title": "Protein S-glutathionylation lowers superoxide/hydrogen peroxide release from skeletal muscle mitochondria through modification of complex I and inhibition of pyruvate uptake.", "abstract": "Protein S-glutathionylation is a reversible redox modification that regulates mitochondrial metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in liver and cardiac tissue. However, whether or not it controls ROS release from skeletal muscle mitochondria has not been explored. In the present study, we examined if chemically-induced protein S-glutathionylation could alter superoxide (O2\u25cf-)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release from isolated muscle mitochondria. Disulfiram, a powerful chemical S-glutathionylation catalyst, was used to S-glutathionylate mitochondrial proteins and ascertain if it can alter ROS production. It was found that O2\u25cf-/H2O2 release rates from permeabilized muscle mitochondria decreased with increasing doses of disulfiram (100-500 \u03bcM). This effect was highest in mitochondria oxidizing succinate or palmitoyl-carnitine, where a ~80-90% decrease in the rate of ROS release was observed. Similar effects were detected in intact mitochondria respiring under state 4 conditions. Incubation of disulfiram-treated mitochondria with DTT (2 mM) restored ROS release confirming that these effects were associated with protein S-glutathionylation. Disulfiram treatment also inhibited phosphorylating and proton leak-dependent respiration. Radiolabelled substrate uptake experiments demonstrated that disulfiram inhibited pyruvate import but had no effect on carnitine uptake. Immunoblot analysis of complex I revealed that it contained several protein S-glutathionylation targets including NDUSF1, a subunit required for NADH oxidation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that O2\u25cf-/H2O2 release from muscle mitochondria can be altered by protein S-glutathionylation.

The groups A and D were composed by negative and positive controls, respectively; while the groups B and E were treated prophylactically with IgY (50\u00a0mg/kg), and the groups C and F were treated therapeutically with IgY (50\u00a0mg/kg). Treatment with IgY reduced parasitemia on day 6 post-infection (PI) compared to the infected control group, but it was similar on day 8 PI. Moreover, infected and treated animals (the groups E and F) did not show neither amastigotes in the cardiac tissue nor cardiac lesions when compared to the positive control group (the group D). The E-NTPDase (ATP and ADP as substrate) and ADA activities in splenic lymphocytes increased significantly in the positive control group (the group D) compared to the negative control group (the group A). The therapeutic treatment of IgY (the group F) was able to prevent the increase of E-NTPDase and E-ADA activities compared to the positive control group (the group D), but this finding was not observed in animals that received the prophylactic treatment (the group E).

{"title": "Evaluation of dicloran phototoxicity using primary cardiomyocyte culture from Crassostrea virginica.", "abstract": "Dicloran is a commonly used fungicide throughout the Southern and Western United States. Runoff of dicloran from agriculture systems to nearby waterbodies can accumulate in the organisms that inhabit those areas. Although severe damage of dicloran to ecological systems has not been reported, its toxicity has been modified by photodegradation. The objective of this study is to assess the changes of dicloran toxicities during photo exposure using a reliable in vitro biological model. In the present investigation, the photodegradation of dicloran in vitro showed over 90% of dicloran was degraded within 24h of UV exposure in water. Two major intermediate degradation products, 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone (CBQ) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), were detected upon UV exposure of dicloran; however, they were rapidly degraded via photolysis. To estimate the impact of the phototoxicity of dicloran to aquatic organisms, we developed an in vitro cell culture system using the C. virginica cardiomyoctes (CvCMs) which were isolated from heart tissues and formed beating cell clusters. The CvCM clusters were treated with irradiated dicloran or the two intermediate standards, CBQ and BQ, and they showed up to 41% decrease in beating rates compared to control cell clusters. Expression levels of selected genes: def, hsp70, and cam, were upregulated in response to stimulations of UV irradiated dicloran and the two standard intermediates. The four-hour irradiated dicloran also resulted in more significant inhibition in the proliferation and small cardioactive peptide \u03b2 production of CvCMs than other treatment. Tested solutions of photolyzed dicloran showed elevated toxicities opposed to the standard intermediates, CBQ and BQ, suggesting additive toxicity of these dicloran products or toxicity due to other unidentified degradation products. Results of this study supported our hypothesis that the degradation of dicloran caused by photo irradiation results in an elevated toxicity which can be evaluated by the in vitro CvCM model.", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2018-02-13", "authors": ["WeiXu", "Emily NVebrosky", "Mackenzie LRichards", "Kevin LArmbrust"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.022"}

Ventricular pacing using a bipolar catheter was performed at a rate slightly higher than intrinsic sinus rate to mimic VT. The myocardium at the tip of the pacing catheter was targeted for ablation.

In five separate experimental preparations, pacing could be terminated successfully during HIFU energy delivery, which was further confirmed by electrical nonexcitation. However, capture could be obtained at other nonablated locations using the same pacing catheter. Both transmural and localized lesions could be created in a controlled fashion without apparent injury to skin, lung, or pericardium on postmortem examination.\nThis pilot study suggests that HIFU is potentially useful for noninvasive ablation of targeted, localized myocardial tissues, and it may be potentially applicable for VT ablation, particularly for those with intramyocardial/epicardial origins.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2018-02-13", "authors": ["FeiL\u00fc", "WeiHuang", "David GBenditt"], "doi": "10.1111/jce.13459"}

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapies to prevent I/R injury. Clusterin is a hetero-dimeric glycoprotein with an antiapoptotic function. In this study, we investigated whether clusterin was cardioprotective in heart transplantation against I/R injury using an in vivo rat model and an in vitro cell culture system, and examined the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury.\nHeart grafts from wild-type C57BL/6 mice were preserved in UW solution (control) or UW solution containing recombinant human apolipoprotein-J (hr clusterin) for 24 h. The preserved hearts were implanted into recipient mice of the same strain as the donors for 72 h, and the heart grafts were then taken for histopathological and gene expression analyses. An in vitro ischemia reperfusion model using H9C2 cells or H9C2/clusterin cDNA cells was constructed. The expression of clusterin, p65, Bax, Bcl-xL, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 protein and mRNA in heart tissue and H9C2 cells was detected by western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and quantitative RT-PCR assays; IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 protein was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; NF-kB activity was detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay; cell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and flow cytometric analyses.\nCold I/R caused severe morphologic myocardial injury to heart grafts from wild-type C57BL/6 mice, whereas grafts from hr clusterin preservation showed less damage, as demonstrated by decreased cell apoptosis/death, decreased neutrophil infiltration, and the preservation of the normal structure of the heart. Clusterin reduced the expression of p65, pre-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, and the pro-apoptotic gene Bax, while it enhanced the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo. Clusterin inhibited cell apoptosis/death and reduced pre-inflammatory.\nClusterin is a promising target for preventing cold I/R injury in heart transplantation.

The donor hearts were collected and perfused, via the coronary artery, with 800\u202f\u03bcl of recombinant adenovirus carrying the P53 gene (Ad-P53). Thirty minutes later, heart transplant was performed. At 5\u202fd after the transplant surgery, the expression of the exogenous P53 gene and protein in the coronary artery tissues of the donor hearts was examined. At 28\u202fd after the transplant surgery, tissues were collected from the transplanted hearts. The degree of coronary artery stenosis was examined, and apoptosis of the coronary artery smooth muscle cells in the donor hearts was analysed. In addition, histological changes in the vital organs of the recipient rats and the levels of serum biochemical indicators in the rats were also examined.\nThe exogenous gene was successfully transferred into donor heart tissues and the coronary artery and was highly expressed. At 28\u202fd after the transplant surgery, the ratio of tunica intima thickness to tunica media thickness (I/M) and the ratio of wall thickness to the lumen diameter of the coronary artery were decreased in the Ad-P53 group compared to those in the Ad-LacZ group and the control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

SMY-based treatment has been derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), officially recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.\nWe aimed to clarify whether SMY attenuates myocardial injury induced by adriamycin in Wistar rats with chronic heart failure (CHF).\nTo quantify ginsenoside Rg1, ophiopogonin D, ophiopogonin D', schisandrin by HPLC. To establish CHF animal model, adriamycin was intraperitoneally injected in Wistar rats for 7 weeks at a dose of 2\u202fmg/kg body weight. Overall, 180 rats were randomly assigned to six groups: control, CHF model, captopril (positive control), high dose (HSMY), medium dose (MSMY), and low dose (LSMY). Experimental rats were fed 0.625\u202fmg/kg captopril and 90\u202fmg/kg, 45\u202fmg/kg, and 22.5\u202fmg/kg SMY, respectively, over 7 weeks. The inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were measured using ELISA. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were identified using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Both IHC and RT-PCR were used for quantification of COL-IV expression levels in the heart tissues. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the visualization of myocardium morphology.\nThe concentration of ginsenoside Rg1, ophiopogonin D, ophiopogonin D' and schisandrin in SMY was found to be 25.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.42\u202fmg, 11.00\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.17\u202fmg, 7.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.51\u202fmg, and 25.31\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.28\u202fmg per gram of SMY, respectively. Compared with CHF model group, TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly lower (p\u202f<\u202f.01) in the four drug-administered groups. Moreover, except in the SYM low dose group, IL-6 levels in the other 3 drug-administered groups were also significantly reduced (p\u202f<\u202f.01). COL-IV expression was also significantly reduced on treatment with high SYM dose (p\u202f<\u202f.05). IHC results confirmed that SMY and captopril significantly reduced MMPs expression in the heart.\nSMY could control or slow CHF progression by suppressing pathological changes in the myocardium in CHF models. This could be attributed at least partly to the downregulation of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and inhibition of overexpression of MMPs and COL-IV, which significantly relieved the cardiac-linked pathologies, decreased the risk of myocardial fibrosis, and inhibited cardiac remodeling. These findings suggested that SMY and captopril have similar efficacy for the treatment of adriamycin-induced myocardial injury.

{"title": "Predicting patient exposure to nickel released from cardiovascular devices using multi-scale modeling.", "abstract": "Many cardiovascular device alloys contain nickel, which if released in sufficient quantities, can lead to adverse health effects. However, in-vivo nickel release from implanted devices and subsequent biodistribution of nickel ions to local tissues and systemic circulation are not well understood. To address this uncertainty, we have developed a multi-scale (material, tissue, and system) biokinetic model. The model links nickel release from an implanted cardiovascular device to concentrations in peri-implant tissue, as well as in serum and urine, which can be readily monitored. The model was parameterized for a specific cardiovascular implant, nitinol septal occluders, using in-vitro nickel release test results, studies of ex-vivo uptake into heart tissue, and in-vivo and clinical measurements from the literature. Our results show that the model accurately predicts nickel concentrations in peri-implant tissue in an animal model and in serum and urine of septal occluder patients. The congruity of the model with these data suggests it may provide useful insight to establish nickel exposure limits and interpret biomonitoring data. Finally, we use the model to predict local and systemic nickel exposure due to passive release from nitinol devices produced using a wide range of manufacturing processes, as well as general relationships between release rate and exposure. These relationships suggest that peri-implant tissue and serum levels of nickel will remain below 5\u202f\u03bcg/g and 10\u202f\u03bcg/l, respectively, in patients who have received implanted nitinol cardiovascular devices provided the rate of nickel release per device surface area does not exceed 0.074\u202f\u03bcg/(cm\nThe uncertainty in whether in-vitro tests used to evaluate metal ion release from medical products are representative of clinical environments is one of the largest roadblocks to establishing the associated patient risk.

By providing clinically relevant exposure estimates, the model vastly improves the evaluation of risk posed to patients by the nickel contained within these devices.

However, DOX exhibits a dose-related toxicity that results in life-threatening cardiomyopathy. In addition to the heart, there is evidence that DOX toxicity extends to other organs. This general toxicity seems to be related to mitochondrial network structural, molecular and functional impairments. Several countermeasures for these negative effects have been proposed, being physical exercise, not only one of the most effective non-pharmacologic strategy but also widely recommended as booster against cancer-related fatigue. It is widely accepted that mitochondria are critical sensors of tissue functionality, both modulated by DOX and exercise. Therefore, this review focuses on the current understanding of the mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms underlying the protective effect of exercise against DOX-induced toxicity, not only limited to the cardiac tissue, but also in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver and brain. We here analyze recent developments regarding the beneficial effects of exercise targeting mitochondrial responsive phenotypes against redox changes, mitochondrial bioenergetics, apoptotic, dynamics and quality control signalling affected by DOX treatment.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

To address this issue, we developed facile and safe, suture-free technology for the attachment of engineered tissues to organs. Here, nanocomposite scaffolds comprised of albumin electrospun fibers and gold nanorods (AuNRs) were developed. Cardiac cells were seeded within the scaffolds and assembled into a functioning patch. The engineered tissue was then positioned on the myocardium and irradiated with a near IR laser (808 nm). The AuNRs were able to absorb the light and convert it to thermal energy, which locally changed the molecular structure of the fibrous scaffold, and strongly, but safely, attached it to the wall of the heart.

Skeletal ECM (sECM) is readily available and shows similarities with cECM. Here we hypothesized that sECM might be an alternative scaffold for ECT strategies.\nMurine ventricular tissue and anterior tibial muscles were sectioned into 300 mm-thick, and then cECM and sECM were acquired by pretreatment/SDS/TritonX-100 three-step-method. Acellularity and morphological properties of ECM was assessed. SECM was recellularized with murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) or mESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs), and was further studied by biocompatibility assessment, immunofluorescent staining, quantitative real-time PCR and electrophysiological experiment.\nThe relative residual contents of DNA, protein and RNA of sECM were comparable with cECM. The morphological properties and microstructure of sECM were similar to cECM. SECM supported mESCs to adhere, survive, proliferate and differentiate into functional cardiac microtissue with both electrical stimulated response and normal adrenergic response. Purified mESC-CMs also could adhere, survive, proliferate and form a sECM-based ECT with synchronized contraction within 6 days of recellularization.\nECMs from murine skeletal muscle support survival and cardiac differentiation of mESCs, and are suitable to produce functional ECT patch.

However, whether activin A impacts sympathetic neural remodeling post\u2011MI remains unclear. In the present study, the authors assessed the effects of activin A on sympathetic neural remodeling in a rat model of MI. Rats were randomly divided into sham, MI, and MI\u00a0+\u00a0follistatin\u2011300 (FS, activin A inhibitor) groups.

Heart function was assessed by echocardiography. It is demonstrated that FS administration significantly reduced post\u2011MI upregulation of activin A, nerve growth factor protein lever, and the density of nerve fibers with positive and protein expression of sympathetic neural remodeling markers in nerve fibers, which included growth associated protein 43 and tyrosine\u00a0hydroxylase.

One of the most important changes leading to arrhythmias is characterised by the presence of a large number of non-excitable cells in the heart, of which the most well-known example is fibrosis. Recently, adipose tissue was put forward as another similar factor contributing to cardiac arrhythmias. Adipocytes infiltrate into cardiac tissue and produce in-excitable obstacles that interfere with myocardial conduction. However, adipose infiltrates have a different spatial texture than fibrosis. Over the course of time, adipose tissue also remodels into fibrotic tissue. In this paper we investigate the arrhythmogenic mechanisms resulting from the presence of adipose tissue in the heart using computer modelling. We use the TP06 model for human ventricular cells and study how the size and percentage of adipose infiltrates affects basic properties of wave propagation and the onset of arrhythmias under high frequency pacing in a 2D model for cardiac tissue. We show that although presence of adipose infiltrates can result in the onset of cardiac arrhythmias, its impact is less than that of fibrosis. We quantify this process and discuss how the remodelling of adipose infiltrates affects arrhythmia onset.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2018-02-03", "authors": ["TimDe Coster", "PietClaus", "Ivan VKazbanov", "PeterHaemers", "RikWillems", "Karin RSipido", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-20450-w\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.21.2334\n10.1136/hrt.2006.110791\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.10.057\n10.1161/CIRCEP.107.754564\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.004\n10.1001/archinte.166.21.2322\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn324\n10.1001/jama.292.20.2471\n10.1016/j.ahj.2007.10.004\n10.1136/heart.85.3.253\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.08.016\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002238\n10.1136/heart.85.3.253\n10.1137/030602654\n10.1371/journal.pone.0117110\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.158101\n10.1038/srep20835\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.2527/jas1980.50167x\n10.1210/jc.2004-0395\n10.1038/ncpcardio0319\n10.1093/cvr/cvw073\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02054.x\n10.1016/S0735-1097(97)00332-X\n10.1161/01.CIR.94.5.983\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1105"}
{"title": "The role of conductivity discontinuities in design of cardiac defibrillation.", "abstract": "Fibrillation is an erratic electrical state of the heart, of rapid twitching rather than organized contractions. Ventricular fibrillation is fatal if not treated promptly. The standard treatment, defibrillation, is a strong electrical shock to reinitialize the electrical dynamics and allow a normal heart beat. Both the normal and the fibrillatory electrical dynamics of the heart are organized into moving wave fronts of changing electrical signals, especially in the transmembrane voltage, which is the potential difference between the cardiac cellular interior and the intracellular region of the heart. In a normal heart beat, the wave front motion is from bottom to top and is accompanied by the release of Ca ions to induce contractions and pump the blood. In a fibrillatory state, these wave fronts are organized into rotating scroll waves, with a centerline known as a filament. Treatment requires altering the electrical state of the heart through an externally applied electrical shock, in a manner that precludes the existence of the filaments and scroll waves. Detailed mechanisms for the success of this treatment are partially understood, and involve local shock-induced changes in the transmembrane potential, known as virtual electrode alterations. These transmembrane alterations are located at boundaries of the cardiac tissue, including blood vessels and the heart chamber wall, where discontinuities in electrical conductivity occur. The primary focus of this paper is the defibrillation shock and the subsequent electrical phenomena it induces. Six partially overlapping causal factors for defibrillation success are identified from the literature. We present evidence in favor of five of these and against one of them. A major conclusion is that a dynamically growing wave front starting at the heart surface appears to play a primary role during defibrillation by critically reducing the volume available to sustain the dynamic motion of scroll waves; in contrast, virtual electrodes occurring at the boundaries of small, isolated blood vessels only cause minor effects. As a consequence, we suggest that the size of the heart (specifically, the surface to volume ratio) is an important defibrillation variable.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2018-02-03", "authors": ["HyunkyungLim", "WenjingCun", "YueWang", "Richard AGray", "JamesGlimm"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5019367"}

The body weight, heart weight to body weight ratio, cardiac biochemical markers, lipid profile, and histological examination of heart were evaluated. The results demonstrated that arsenic exposure led to a significant decrease in heart glutathione level, catalase enzyme activity, and a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde levels, and biochemical enzymes. The administration of HFD resulted in above-mentioned changes as well as an alteration in lipid profile; however, arsenic exposure alone or along with HFD caused a reduction in lipid profile factors, except HDL level. Our results revealed that HFD increased arsenic-induced heart injury in the mice.

However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.\nHere, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and diseased heart.\nAfter optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel markers of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of disease-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor \u03b2 triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.\nSingle-cell sequencing on both the healthy and diseased adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac disease.

Despite this potential, seamless integration of electronics has been difficult due to fundamental mismatches, including size and mechanical properties, between the elements of the electronic and living biological systems. In this Account, we discuss the concept, development, key demonstrations, and future opportunities of mesh nanoelectronics as a general paradigm for seamless integration of electronics within synthetic tissues and live animals. We first describe the design and realization of hybrid synthetic tissues that are innervated in three dimensions (3D) with mesh nanoelectronics where the mesh serves as both as a tissue scaffold and as a platform of addressable electronic devices for monitoring and manipulating tissue behavior. Specific examples of tissue/nanoelectronic mesh hybrids highlighted include 3D neural tissue, cardiac patches, and vascular constructs, where the nanoelectronic devices have been used to carry out real-time 3D recording of electrophysiological and chemical signals in the tissues. This novel platform was also exploited for time-dependent 3D spatiotemporal mapping of cardiac tissue action potentials during cell culture and tissue maturation as well as in response to injection of pharmacological agents. The extension to simultaneous real-time monitoring and active control of tissue behavior is further discussed for multifunctional mesh nanoelectronics incorporating both recording and stimulation devices, providing the unique capability of bidirectional interfaces to cardiac tissue. In the case of live animals, new challenges must be addressed, including minimally invasive implantation, absence of deleterious chronic tissue response, and long-term capability for monitoring and modulating tissue activity. We discuss each of these topics in the context of implantation of mesh nanoelectronics into rodent brains. First, we describe the design of ultraflexible mesh nanoelectronics with size features and mechanical properties similar to brain tissue and a novel syringe-injection methodology that allows the mesh nanoelectronics to be precisely delivered to targeted brain regions in a minimally invasive manner. Next, we discuss time-dependent histology studies showing seamless and stable integration of mesh nanoelectronics within brain tissue on at least one year scales without evidence of chronic immune response or glial scarring characteristic of conventional implants. Third, armed with facile input/output interfaces, we describe multiplexed single-unit recordings that demonstrate stable tracking of the same individual neurons and local neural circuits for at least 8 months, long-term monitoring and stimulation of the same groups of neurons, and following changes in individual neuron activity during brain aging. Moving forward, we foresee substantial opportunities for (1) continued development of mesh nanoelectronics through, for example, broadening nanodevice signal detection modalities and taking advantage of tissue-like properties for selective cell targeting and (2) exploiting the unique capabilities of mesh nanoelectronics for tackling critical scientific and medical challenges such as understanding and potentially ameliorating cell and circuit level changes associated with natural and pathological aging, as well as using mesh nanoelectronics as active tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine and as neuroprosthetics for monitoring and treating neurological diseases.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2018-01-31", "authors": ["XiaochuanDai", "GuosongHong", "TengGao", "Charles MLieber"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00547"}

The deposition conditions of the natural polymers were studied through zeta potential measurements and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring analysis. The properties of the FS films were evaluated and compared with the control ones composed of only CHI and ALG in order to assess the influence of levan polysaccharide introduced in the multilayers. Tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis and single lap shear strength tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the prepared FS films. The presence of L-S conferred both higher tensile strength and shear strength to the developed FS membranes. The results showed an adhesion strength 4 times higher than the control (CHI/ALG) FS films demonstrating the adhesive character of the FS films containing L-S. Morphological and topography studies were carried out revealing that the crosslinking reaction granted the L-S based FS film with a higher roughness and surface homogeneity. Preliminary biological assays were performed by cultivating myoblasts cells on the surface of the produced FS films. Both crosslinked and uncrosslinked FS films containing L-S were cytocompatible and myoconductive.\nSutures remain as the \"gold standard\" for wound closure and bleeding control; however they still have limitations such as, high infection rate, inconvenience in handling, and concern over possible transmission of blood-borne disease through the use of needles. One of the challenges of tissue engineering consist on the design and development of biocompatible tissue adhesives and sealants with high adhesion properties to repair or attach devices to tissues. In this work, the introduction of sulfated levan (L-S) on multilayered free-standing membranes was proposed to confer adhesive properties.

Independent of the nature of the injury, the heart triggers leukocyte activation and recruitment. However, inflammation is harmful to this vital terminally differentiated organ with extremely poor regenerative capacity. As such, cardiac tissue has evolved particular strategies to increase the stress tolerance and minimize the impact of inflammation. In this sense, growing evidences show that mononuclear phagocytic cells are particularly dynamic during cardiac inflammation or infection and would actively participate in tissue repair and functional recovery. They respond to soluble mediators such as metabolites or cytokines, which play central roles in the timing of the intrinsic cardiac stress response. During myocardial infarction two distinct phases of monocyte influx have been identified. Upon infarction, the heart modulates its chemokine expression profile that sequentially and actively recruits inflammatory monocytes, first, and healing monocytes, later.

{"title": "Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Protection Associated with Intermittent Hypobaric Hypoxia Exposure in a Rat Model: Role of Oxidative Stress.", "abstract": "More than 140 million people live and works (in a chronic or intermittent form) above 2500 m worldwide and 35 million live in the Andean Mountains. Furthermore, in Chile, it is estimated that 55,000 persons work in high altitude shifts, where stays at lowlands and interspersed with working stays at highlands. Acute exposure to high altitude has been shown to induce oxidative stress in healthy human lowlanders, due to an increase in free radical formation and a decrease in antioxidant capacity. However, in animal models, intermittent hypoxia (IH) induce preconditioning, like responses and cardioprotection. Here, we aimed to describe in a rat model the responses on cardiac and vascular function to 4 cycles of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH). Twelve adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into two equal groups, a four-cycle of IHH, and a normobaric hypoxic control. Intermittent hypoxia was induced in a hypobaric chamber in four continuous cycles (1 cycle = 4 days hypoxia + 4 days normoxia), reaching a barometric pressure equivalent to 4600 m of altitude (428 Torr). At the end of the first and fourth cycle, cardiac structural, and functional variables were determined by echocardiography. Thereafter, ex vivo vascular function and biomechanical properties were determined in femoral arteries by wire myography. We further measured cardiac oxidative stress biomarkers (4-Hydroxy-nonenal, HNE; nytrotirosine, NT), reactive oxygen species (ROS) sources (NADPH and mitochondrial), and antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPx, and superoxide dismutase, SOD). Our results show a higher ejection and shortening fraction of the left ventricle function by the end of the 4th cycle. Further, femoral vessels showed an improvement of vasodilator capacity and diminished stiffening. Cardiac tissue presented a higher expression of antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial ROS formation in IHH, as compared with normobaric hypoxic controls. IHH exposure determines a preconditioning effect on the heart and femoral artery, both at structural and functional levels, associated with the induction of antioxidant defence mechanisms. However, mitochondrial ROS generation was increased in cardiac tissue. These findings suggest that initial states of IHH are beneficial for cardiovascular function and protection.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2018-01-27", "authors": ["MiguelAguilar", "AlejandroGonz\u00e1lez-Candia", "JorgeRodr\u00edguez", "CatalinaCarrasco-Pozo", "DanielCa\u00f1as", "ClaudioGarc\u00eda-Herrera", "Emilio AHerrera", "Rodrigo LCastillo"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms19020366\n10.1152/ajplung.00089.2014\n10.1016/j.resp.2013.04.021\n10.1089/152702903769192250\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.07.011\n10.1089/ham.2010.1021\n10.1177/1535370213508718\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00056.2005\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000078635.89229.8A\n10.1152/ajpheart.01016.2006\n10.1152/ajpcell.00526.2005\n10.1159/000014602\n10.1007/s00395-011-0159-y\n10.3390/md13020838\n10.1186/s12929-015-0112-8\n10.1016/S0300-8932(99)74941-9\n10.1177/1535370216657614\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152868\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00244-2\n10.1097/00004872-200018060-00002\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000156461.81529.D7\n10.1021/bi051226n\n10.1016/j.lpm.2012.02.003\n10.1111/j.1469-445X.2002.tb00058.x\n10.1016/0163-7258(93)90030-H\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.70.113006.100455\n10.1073/pnas.1609308113\n10.1038/aps.2009.57\n10.1152/ajpregu.00123.2010\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00820.2003\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.11.006\n10.1016/S0300-9572(00)00373-7\n10.4103/1673-5374.194706\n10.1074/jbc.R900010200\n10.1002/cbf.2985\n10.1111/apha.12613\n10.1016/j.pcad.2010.03.004\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00856.2002\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00564.2014\n10.1152/jappl.1992.73.4.1377\n10.1089/15270290260131894\n10.4067/S0716-97602013000100009\n10.1089/ham.2007.8310\n10.1042/CS20030161\n10.1139/cjpp-2014-0343\n10.1089/ham.2013.1134\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-0841\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197723\n10.1089/ham.2006.7.302\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2015\n10.1016/j.resp.2007.03.013\n10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001\n10.1089/ham.2012.1064\n10.1007/s11517-012-0876-x\n10.1016/j.resp.2009.12.003\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000000094\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009250\n10.1111/jpi.12222\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00144\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.09.016"}

{"title": "Integrated approaches to spatiotemporally directing angiogenesis in host and engineered tissues.", "abstract": "The field of tissue engineering has turned towards biomimicry to solve the problem of tissue oxygenation and nutrient/waste exchange through the development of vasculature. Induction of angiogenesis and subsequent development of a vascular bed in engineered tissues is actively being pursued through combinations of physical and chemical cues, notably through the presentation of topographies and growth factors. Presenting angiogenic signals in a spatiotemporal fashion is beginning to generate improved vascular networks, which will allow for the creation of large and dense engineered tissues. This review provides a brief background on the cells, mechanisms, and molecules driving vascular development (including angiogenesis), followed by how biomaterials and growth factors can be used to direct vessel formation and maturation. Techniques to accomplish spatiotemporal control of vascularization include incorporation or encapsulation of growth factors, topographical engineering, and 3D bioprinting. The vascularization of engineered tissues and their application in angiogenic therapy in vivo is reviewed herein with an emphasis on the most densely vascularized tissue of the human body - the heart.\nVascularization is vital to wound healing and tissue regeneration, and development of hierarchical networks enables efficient nutrient transfer. In tissue engineering, vascularization is necessary to support physiologically dense engineered tissues, and thus the field seeks to induce vascular formation using biomaterials and chemical signals to provide appropriate, pro-angiogenic signals for cells. This review critically examines the materials and techniques used to generate scaffolds with spatiotemporal cues to direct vascularization in engineered and host tissues in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Preclinical approaches to assess potential kinase inhibitor-induced cardiac toxicity: Past, present and future.", "abstract": "Over a decade ago, use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of malignancies was found to cause left ventricular dysfunction, a finding that was unexpected and not well predicted by standard preclinical studies. Subsequently, several preclinical approaches were proposed to address this issue. Over the last 5\u00a0years, several approaches for preclinical evaluation of cardiac function using isolated perfused hearts, engineered heart tissue and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes have been shown to be relatively predictive of the cardiotoxic potential of TKIs. Further, preclinical studies submitted for regulatory review for recently approved KIs have demonstrated various forms of KI-induced cardiotoxicity. Thus, early identification and assessment of cardiotoxicity in the preclinical setting is now possible. Given that kinases are involved in diverse cellular processes common to both normal and tumor cells, KI-induced toxicity, particularly in the heart, appears difficult to avoid. To develop drugs with fewer adverse effects, better efficacy and safety assessments, such as pharmacological separation of targets for cancer from heart, and/or wider separation of the drug concentrations for antitumor activity from cardiac toxicity, may be helpful. Additional preclinical approaches for assessing drug efficacy and toxicity in parallel may include use of animal cancer models and a 3D integrated in vitro model of perfused tumor and heart tissues. Minimizing and predicting potential KI-induced cardiotoxicity is still an important regulatory challenge, and better preclinical approaches may help achieve this goal.", "journal": "Journal of applied toxicology : JAT", "date": "2018-01-26", "authors": ["BaichunYang", "ThomasPapoian"], "doi": "10.1002/jat.3584"}
{"title": "Stat5-dependent cardioprotection in late remote ischaemia preconditioning.", "abstract": "To study the protective effects of late remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) against myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and determine whether Stat5 is involved in this protection by using cardiomyocyte-specific Stat5 knockout mice (Stat5-cKO).\nMice were exposed to lower limb RIPC or sham ischaemia. After 24 h, the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated for 30 min, then reperfused for 180 min. The myocardial infarct size (IS), apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes, and serum myocardial enzymes were measured to evaluate for cardioprotective effects. Heart tissues were harvested to determine the cardiomyocytes' anti-apoptotic and survival signaling. When compared with the Stat5fl/fl mice without RIPC, Stat5fl/fl mice with RIPC (Stat5fl/fl+RIPC + I/R) displayed a decreased myocardial IS/LV (16 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 30.1 \u00b1 3.1%, P < 0.01; IS/ area at risk (AAR), 42.2 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 69.2 \u00b1 4.9%, P < 0.01), a reduced cardiomyocyte apoptotic rate (2.1 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 5.5 \u00b1 0.53%, P < 0.01), and lower creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels. To the contrary, the Stat5-cKO mice (Stat5fl/fl; Tnnt2Cremice with Doxycycline treatment for 7 days) did not exhibit any effect of RIPC-induced cardioprotection. Activation of STAT5 protein was significantly higher in the Stat5fl/fl+RIPC + I/R group than in the Stat5fl/fl+I/R group, while there was no significant difference between the Stat5-cKO + RIPC + I/R and the Stat5-cKO + I/R group. Further analyses with heart tissues detected decreased protein expressions of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and cleaved Caspase-3 in the Stat5fl/fl+RIPC + I/R mice, along with increased anti-apoptotic molecules, including B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2); such changes were not noted in the Stat5-cKO + RIPC + I/R mice. Additionally, RIPC increased cardiac hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and interleukin-10 (IL10) protein levels and caused activation of AKT, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and vascular endothelial growth factor in the heart of the Stat5fl/fl mice. However, these changes were completely inhibited by the absence of Stat5.\nThese results suggest that RIPC-induced late cardioprotection against myocardial I/R injury is Stat5-dependent and is correlated with the activation of anti-apoptotic signaling and cardiomyocyte-survival signaling.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2018-01-25", "authors": ["HuiChen", "Xin-YueJing", "Yu-JunShen", "Tian-LinWang", "ChenOu", "Sheng-FengLu", "YunCai", "QianLi", "XiaChen", "Ya-JuanDing", "Xiao-ChunYu", "Bing-MeiZhu"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvy014"}
{"title": "Ac-SDKP decreases mortality and cardiac rupture after acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "The natural peptide N-Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP) decreases inflammation in chronic diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. However, Ac-SDKP effects on acute inflammatory responses during myocardial infarction (MI) are unknown. During the first 72 hours post-MI, neutrophils, M1 macrophages (pro-inflammatory), and M2 macrophages (pro-resolution) and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are involved in cardiac rupture. We hypothesized that in the acute stage of MI, Ac-SDKP decreases the incidence of cardiac rupture and mortality by preventing immune cell infiltration as well as by decreasing MPO and MMP expression. MI was induced by ligating the left descending coronary artery in C57BL/6 mice. Vehicle or Ac-SDKP (1.6 mg/kg/d) was infused via osmotic minipump. Cardiac immune cell infiltration was assessed by flow cytometry, cardiac MPO and MMP levels were measured at 24-48 hrs post-MI. Cardiac rupture and mortality incidence were determined at 7 days post-MI. In infarcted mice, Ac-SDKP significantly decreased cardiac rupture incidence from 51.0% (26 of 51 animals) to 27.3% (12 of 44) and mortality from 56.9% (29 of 51) to 31.8% (14 of 44). Ac-SDKP reduced M1 macrophages in cardiac tissue after MI, without affecting M2 macrophages and neutrophils. Ac-SDKP decreased MMP-9 activation in infarcted hearts with no changes on MPO expression. Ac-SDKP prevents cardiac rupture and decreases mortality post-acute MI. These protective effects of Ac-SDKP are associated with decreased pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage infiltration and MMP-9 activation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2018-01-25", "authors": ["PabloNakagawa", "Cesar ARomero", "XuJiang", "MartinD'Ambrosio", "GinetteBordcoch", "Edward LPeterson", "PamelaHarding", "Xiao-PingYang", "Oscar ACarretero"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0190300\n10.1097/CRD.0b013e3181bf4ab4\n10.1038/13459\n10.1084/jem.20021426\n10.1152/ajpheart.00300.2011\n10.1152/ajprenal.00039.2015\n10.1152/ajpheart.00129.2014\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000107777.91185.89\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.144568\n10.1681/ASN.2005040385\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1093/cvr/cvn292\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.015\n10.1159/000374048\n10.1152/ajpheart.00305.2007\n10.1172/JCI85782\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.05.016\n10.1152/ajpheart.00592.2004\n10.1152/ajpheart.00252.2015"}
{"title": "Quantitative and histological assessment of maternal-fetal transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in guinea pigs: An experimental model of congenital Chagas disease.", "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of Trypanosoma cruzi infection on fertility, gestation outcome, and maternal-fetal transmission in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).\nAnimals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams and fetuses were obtained near parturition.\nAll IBG and IDG dams were seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62\u00b12.2 and 50.1\u00b162 parasites/\u03bcl, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153\u00b1104.7 and 169.3\u00b1129.4 in IBG and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2\u00b134.3 and 79.2\u00b184.9 were detected in IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both groups.\nT. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high virulence of the parasite during pregnancy.

The aim of this study was to use metabonomics and molecular biology techniques to systematically elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TCC-induced effects on cardiac function in mice. Our results show that TCC inhibited the uptake, synthesis, and oxidation of fatty acids, suppressed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and increased aerobic glycolysis levels in heart tissue after short-term TCC exposure. TCC also inhibited the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), confirming its inhibitory effects on fatty acid uptake and oxidation.

We have recently demonstrated that a polyaniline chitosan patch can efficiently electro-couple with cardiac tissue modulating its electrophysiology. As a promising bioelectronic material that can be tailored to different types of devices, we investigate here the impact of varying the synthesis conditions and time of the in situ polymerization of aniline (An) on the sheet resistance of the bioelectronic patch. The sheet resistance increases significantly for samples that have either the lowest molar ratio of oxidant to monomer or the highest molar ratio of dopant to monomer, while the polymerization time does not have a significant effect on the electrical properties. Conductive atomic force microscopy reveals that the patch with the lowest sheet resistance has a connected network of the conductive phase. In contrast, patches with higher sheet resistances exhibit conductive areas of lower current signals or isolated conductive islands of high current signals. Having identified the formulation that results in patches with optimal electrical properties, we used it to fabricate patches that were implanted in rats for two weeks. It is shown that the patch retains an electroactive nature, and only mild inflammation is observed with fibrous tissue encapsulating the patch.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2018-01-25", "authors": ["ChenCui", "NastaranFaraji", "AntonioLauto", "LorenzoTravaglini", "JoanneTonkin", "DavidMahns", "EleanorHumphrey", "CesareTerracciano", "J JustinGooding", "JanSeidel", "DamiaMawad"], "doi": "10.1039/c7bm00880e"}

{"title": "Real-Time Closed Loop Diastolic Interval Control Prevents Cardiac Alternans in Isolated Whole Rabbit Hearts.", "abstract": "Cardiac alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential duration (APD), can lead to fatal arrhythmias. During periodic pacing, changes in diastolic interval (DI) depend on subsequent changes in APD, thus enhancing cardiac instabilities through a 'feedback' mechanism. Recently, an anti-arrhythmic Constant DI pacing protocol was proposed and shown to be effective in suppressing alternans in 0D and 1D in silico studies. However, previous\u00a0experimental validation of Constant DI pacing\u00a0in the heart has been unsuccessful due to the spatio-temporal complexity of 2D cardiac tissue and the technical challenges in its real-time implementation. Here, we developed a novel closed loop system to detect T-waves from real-time ECG data, enabling successful implementation of Constant DI pacing protocol, and performed high-resolution optical mapping experiments on isolated whole rabbit hearts to validate its anti-arrhythmic effects. The results were compared with: (1) Periodic pacing (feedback inherent) and (2) pacing with heart rate variability (HRV) (feedback modulation) introduced by using either Gaussian or Physiological patterns. We observed that Constant DI pacing\u00a0significantly suppressed alternans in the heart, while maintaining APD spatial dispersion and flattening the slope of the APD restitution curve, compared to traditional Periodic pacing. In addition, introduction of HRV in Periodic\u00a0pacing failed to prevent cardiac alternans, and was arrhythmogenic.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2018-01-23", "authors": ["KanchanKulkarni", "Steven WLee", "RyanKluck", "Elena GTolkacheva"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-018-1981-2"}

{"title": "Examination of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) as a Potential Biomarker in Heart Failure Patients.", "abstract": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a pleiotropic and multifunctional neuropeptide having neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and general cytoprotective actions in a variety of tissues based on its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Several studies have demonstrated its cardioprotective effects in vitro and in various animal models. However, few data are available on the presence of PACAP in human cardiac tissues and its role in the pathomechanism and progression of different cardiac disorders, particularly heart failure. Earlier, our research group has shown PAC1 receptor immunoreactivity in human heart tissue samples and we have found significantly elevated PACAP27- and PACAP38-like immunoreactivity in ischemic cardiac samples compared to valvular abnormalities with radioimmunoassay. In the last few years, numerous studies examined the presence and the changes of PACAP levels in different human tissue samples and biological fluids to show alterations in different physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to measure the alterations of blood PACAP levels in chronic heart failure caused by primary dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic cardiomyopathy and to examine the possible relationship between serum levels of PACAP, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and systolic left ventricular function, the most reliable biomarkers of heart failure. In the group of mild heart failure patients, a significant strong negative correlation was detected. Furthermore, in moderate heart failure, we found a significant moderate negative correlation between PACAP and NT-proBNP levels only in ischemic subgroup. Positive correlation was found between serum PACAP level and ejection fraction only in patients with heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy but not in patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy. In summary, remarkable differences were observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure suggesting that PACAP might play an important role in the pathomechanism and progression of ischemic heart failure and it might be a potential biomarker of cardiac diseases in the future.", "journal": "Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN", "date": "2018-01-22", "authors": ["ZsoltSarszegi", "DoraSzabo", "BalazsGaszner", "AttilaKonyi", "DoraReglodi", "JozsefNemeth", "BeataLelesz", "BeataPolgar", "AdelJungling", "AndreaTamas"], "doi": "10.1007/s12031-017-1025-7"}
{"title": "Effect of Kaempferol Pretreatment on Myocardial Injury in Rats.", "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of kaempferol in isoprenaline (ISP)-induced myocardial injury in rats. ISP was administered subcutaneously for two subsequent days to induce myocardial injury. Assessment of myocardial injury was done by estimation of hemodynamic functions, myocardial infarcted area, cardiac injury markers, lipid profile, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and histopathology of heart and liver. Rats pretreated with kaempferol showed reduction in the myocardial infarcted area and heart rate. However, no improvement was observed in change in body weight, mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Kaempferol showed significant decrease in serum LDH, CK-MB, troponin-I and lipid profile. However, highest dose of kaempferol did not reduce the serum triglyceride level. Further, antioxidant enzymes, SOD and catalase, were also higher. However, reduced glutathione, serum SGOT and creatinine did not show any improvement. Kaempferol showed reduction in MDA level. Kaempferol at highest dose showed reduction in pro-MMP-2 expression and MMP-9 level. mRNA expression level of TNF-\u03b1 was not different in kaempferol-pretreated myocardial injured rats with ISP-alone group. Pretreatment with kaempferol at highest dose showed mild mononuclear infiltration and degenerative changes in heart tissue section of myocardial injured rats. Rats pretreated with kaempferol at higher concentration showed normal cordlike arrangement of hepatocytes with moderate swelling of hepatocytes (vacuolar degeneration) around the central vein.

{"title": "Schistosoma mansoni and endocarditis: from egg to free DNA detection in Egyptian patients and infected BALB/c mice.", "abstract": "With the growing incidence of closed schistosomiasis and uncommon presentations, there is a risk of the infection rate being underestimated. A study in Japan reported an unexplained case of endocarditis that was finally diagnosed as a complex Schistosoma japonicum infection; in the absence of advanced techniques, the diagnosis was delayed. We therefore set out to explore the incidence of Schistosoma mansoni in endocarditis patients coming from areas of Egypt where S. mansoni is endemic. We also investigated histopathological changes in the cardiac valves and the presence of cell-free parasite DNA (CFPD) in cardiac tissues of laboratory mice infected with S. mansoni. The study included 186 patients with the manifestations of infective endocarditis. Eggs were detected in the stool samples of 5.91% of patients. Seropositivity was reported in 23.66% of patients and antigen was detected in the urine samples of 10.21%. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), CFPD was detected in the blood of 6.98% of the endocarditis patients and 95% of the infected mice, while the cardiac samples of 45% of the mice tested positive for CFPD (means \u00b1 SD = 1390.2 \u00b1 283.65, 2158.72 \u00b1 1103.1 and 5.71 \u00b1 2.91, respectively). Histopathological examination revealed abnormal collagen deposition, inflammatory cells and haemorrhagic pigmentation in the heart sections. Despite the low incidence of S. mansoni infection in the studied cohort, the presence of CFPD in the cardiac tissue of infected mice makes it necessary to: (1) investigate the hazards of CFPD deposition in endothelium-rich organs; and (2) test the potential of CFPD to trigger tissue inflammation, abnormal proliferation or genome integration.", "journal": "Journal of helminthology", "date": "2018-01-22", "authors": ["M AHasby Saad", "M MWatany"], "doi": "10.1017/S0022149X17001183"}

{"title": "Molecular imaging of cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction and subsequent heart failure is a major health burden associated with significant mortality and morbidity in western societies. The ability of cardiac tissue to recover after myocardial infarction is affected by numerous complex cellular and molecular pathways. Unbalance or failure of these pathways can lead to adverse remodelling of the heart and poor prognosis. Current clinical cardiac imaging modalities assess anatomy, perfusion, function, and viability of the myocardium, yet do not offer any insight into the specific molecular pathways involved in the repair process. Novel imaging techniques allow visualisation of these molecular processes and may have significant diagnostic and prognostic values, which could aid clinical management. Single photon-emission tomography, positron-emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are used to visualise various aspects of these molecular processes. Imaging probes are usually attached to radioisotopes or paramagnetic nanoparticles to specifically target biological processes such as: apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and scar formation. Although the results from preclinical studies are promising, translating this work to a clinical environment in a valuable and cost-effective way is extremely challenging.

Untreated pericardia were used as native control. Histological examination, residual cellular content analysis, biochemical and biomechanical evaluations and cytotoxicity assay were performed to investigate decellularization efficiency, xenoantigens removal, extracellular matrix preservation and biocompatibility. In vivo biocompatibility was evaluated using a subcutaneous implantation method in rats.\nAmong these protocols, FSS and FTS protocols were the most effective methods to remove both the DNA material and the galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose antigen. TX, TS and FTS bovine pericardia maintained the collagen content and had no cytotoxicity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The contents of elastin and glycosaminoglycan were lost to different degrees after decellularization, with the highest content of preservation with TX, followed by TS and FTS. Consistently, no significant difference was found between native bovine pericardia and TX, TS or FTS bovine pericardia. In vivo, FTS implants had minimal infiltration of macrophages and T-lymphocytes, with no histological evidence of peri-implant necrosis and calcification.\nThese results suggested that the FTS protocol showed optimal decellularization results with better extracellular matrix preservation and good biocompatibility.

Cardiomyopathy is common in MFM but the pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. The BAG3-Pro209Leu mutation is associated with early onset MFM and severe restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), often necessitating heart transplantation during childhood. We report on a young male patient with a BAG3-Pro209Leu mutation who underwent heart transplantation at eight years of age. Detailed morphological analyses of the explanted heart tissue showed intracytoplasmic inclusions, aggregation of BAG3 and desmin, disintegration of myofibers and Z-disk alterations. The presence of undegraded autophagosomes, seen by electron microscopy, as well as increased levels of p62, LC3-I and WIPI1, detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses, indicated a dysregulation of autophagy. Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in mitophagy, were slightly increased whereas mitochondrial OXPHOS activities were not altered. These findings indicate that altered autophagy plays a role in the pathogenesis and rapid progression of RCM in MFM caused by the BAG3-Pro209Leu mutation, which could have implications for future therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and metabolism", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["ASch\u00e4nzer", "SRupp", "SGr\u00e4f", "DZengeler", "CJux", "HAkint\u00fcrk", "LGulatz", "NMazhari", "TAcker", "RVan Coster", "B KGarvalov", "AHahn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2018.01.001"}

As infection in mice is characterized by depletion of plasma L-arginine, the effect on infection outcome was tested in mice with or without L-arginine supplementation and treatment with 1400W, a specific inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). We found that levels of L-arginine and citrulline were reduced in the heart and plasma of infected mice, whereas levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous iNOS inhibitor, were higher. Moreover, L-arginine supplementation decreased parasitemia and heart parasite burden, improving clinical score and survival. Nitric oxide production in heart tissue and plasma was increased by L-arginine supplementation, while pharmacological inhibition of iNOS yielded an increase in parasitemia and worse clinical score. Interestingly, electrocardiograms improved in mice supplemented with L-arginine, suggesting that it modulates infection and heart function and is thus a potential biomarker of pathology.

{"title": "Automated fabrication of photopatterned gelatin hydrogels for organ-on-chips applications.", "abstract": "Organ-on-chip platforms aim to improve preclinical models for organ-level responses to novel drug compounds. Heart-on-a-chip assays in particular require tissue engineering techniques that rely on labor-intensive photolithographic fabrication or resolution-limited 3D printing of micropatterned substrates, which limits turnover and flexibility of prototyping. We present a rapid and automated method for large scale on-demand micropatterning of gelatin hydrogels for organ-on-chip applications using a novel biocompatible laser-etching approach. Fast and automated micropatterning is achieved via photosensitization of gelatin using riboflavin-5'phosphate followed by UV laser-mediated photoablation of the gel surface in user-defined patterns only limited by the resolution of the 15 \u03bcm wide laser focal point. Using this photopatterning approach, we generated microscale surface groove and pillar structures with feature dimensions on the order of 10-30 \u03bcm. The standard deviation of feature height was 0.3 \u03bcm, demonstrating robustness and reproducibility. Importantly, the UV-patterning process is non-destructive and does not alter gelatin micromechanical properties. Furthermore, as a quality control step, UV-patterned heart chip substrates were seeded with rat or human cardiac myocytes, and we verified that the resulting cardiac tissues achieved structural organization, contractile function, and long-term viability comparable to manually patterned gelatin substrates. Start-to-finish, UV-patterning shortened the time required to design and manufacture micropatterned gelatin substrates for heart-on-chip applications by up to 60% compared to traditional lithography-based approaches, providing an important technological advance enroute to automated and continuous manufacturing of organ-on-chips.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["Janna CNawroth", "Lisa LScudder", "Ryan THalvorson", "JasonTresback", "John PFerrier", "Sean PSheehy", "AlexCho", "SurajKannan", "IlonaSunyovszki", "Josue AGoss", "Patrick HCampbell", "Kevin KitParker"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa96de"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of Drpl during inflammatory myocardial injury. Sprague\u2011Dawley rats were treated intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Furthermore, cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with LPS, interleukin\u20116 (IL\u20116) and tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1). Total and mitochondrial proteins were isolated from the heart tissue of rats and from the H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Expression levels of Drp1 and RhoA were analyzed by western blotting. Mitochondrial morphology was determined using confocal laser microscopy. The levels of mitochondrial Drp1 and phosphorylated\u2011Drp1 (p\u2011Drp1) Ser616 were revealed to be increased in rats 6\u00a0h after injection with LPS (5, 10\u00a0or\u00a020\u00a0mg/kg). Furthermore, treatment with LPS and IL\u20116 did not demonstrate a significant effect on the expression of total and mitochondrial Drp1 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes in\u00a0vitro; however, treatment with TNF\u2011\u03b1 (20\u00a0ng/ml) significantly enhanced the levels of mitochondrial Drp1 and p\u2011Drp1 Ser616.

In addition, it was revealed that Y\u201127632 and fasudil may also attenuate the TNF\u2011\u03b1\u2011induced increase in mitochondrial fragmentation and cell viability. Therefore, the findings of the present study suggest that TNF\u2011\u03b1 is the predominant inducer of Drp1 S616 phosphorylation during sepsis.

There is a wealth of information that can be obtained from the resulting image stacks but this presents a new challenge for researchers - how to computationally analyse and make best use of the large datasets produced. One approach is to reconstruct structures and features of interest in 3D. However, the software programmes can appear overwhelming, time-consuming and not intuitive for those new to image analysis. There are a limited number of published articles that provide sufficient detail on how to do this type of reconstruction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a detailed step-by-step protocol, accompanied by tutorial videos, for several types of analysis programmes that can be used on raw SBF-SEM data, although there are more options available than can be covered here. To showcase the programmes, datasets of skeletal muscle from foetal and adult guinea pigs are initially used with procedures subsequently applied to guinea pig cardiac tissue and locust brain. The tissue is processed using the heavy metal protocol developed specifically for SBF-SEM. Trimmed resin blocks are placed into a Zeiss Sigma SEM incorporating the Gatan 3View and the resulting image stacks are analysed in three different programmes, Fiji, Amira and MIB, using a range of tools available for segmentation. The results from the image analysis comparison show that the analysis tools are often more suited to a particular type of structure. For example, larger structures, such as nuclei and cells, can be segmented using interpolation, which speeds up analysis; single contrast structures, such as the nucleolus, can be segmented using the contrast-based thresholding tools. Knowing the nature of the tissue and its specific structures (complexity, contrast, if there are distinct membranes, size) will help to determine the best method for reconstruction and thus maximize informative output from valuable tissue.\nElectron microscopes have been used for decades to image cellular detail at high magnification. However the resulting images are 2\u2010dimensional. The development of an electron microscope in which we can section tissue in situ means that we can now acquire stacks of images giving us detail in 3\u2010dimensions. However the challenge with these large datasets is to reconstruct features of interest to form a 3D model. There are a number of computer programs that can be used to do this but they are not intuitive and can be overwhelming for researchers new to them.

However, transplanted cells face low survival rates due to oxidative stress and the inflammatory microenvironment in ischemic heart tissue. Melatonin has been used as a powerful endogenous antioxidant to protect cells from oxidative injury. However, melatonin cannot play a long-lasting effect against the hostile microenvironment. Nano drug delivery carriers have the ability to protect the loaded drug from degradation in physiological environments in a controlled manner, which results in longer effects and decreased side effects. Therefore, we constructed poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-monomethoxy-poly-(polyethylene glycol) (PLGA-mPEG) nanoparticles to encapsulate melatonin. We tested whether the protective effect of melatonin encapsulated by PLGA-mPEG nanoparticles (melatonin nanoparticles [Mel-NPs]) on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) was enhanced compared to that of free melatonin both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro study, we found that Mel-NPs reduced formation of the p53- cyclophilin D complex, prevented mitochondrial permeability transition pores from opening, and rescued ADSCs from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Moreover, Mel-NPs can achieve higher ADSC survival rates than free melatonin in rat myocardial infarction areas, and the therapeutic effects of ADSCs pretreated with Mel-NPs were more apparent. Hence, the combination of Mel-NPs and stem cell transplantation may be a promising strategy for myocardial infarction therapy.

In these patients abnormal thyroid function is significantly related to impaired left ventricular (LV) function and increased risk of death. Although TH was originally thought to be produced exclusively by the thyroid gland, we recently reported TH biosynthesis in the human ischemic heart.\nBased on these findings, we evaluated whether the genes required for TH production are also altered in patients with DCM.\nTwenty-three LV tissue samples were obtained from patients with DCM (n = 13) undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (n = 10), and used for RNA sequencing analysis. The number of LV DCM samples was increased to 23 to determine total T4 and T3 tissue levels by ELISA.\nWe found that all components of TH biosynthesis are expressed in human dilated heart tissue. Expression of genes encoding thyroperoxidase (-2.57-fold, P < 0.05) and dual oxidase 2 (2.64-fold, P < 0.01), the main enzymatic system of TH production, was significantly altered in patients with DCM and significantly associated with LV remodeling parameters.

In an attempt to solve this problem, stem cell therapy has emerged as a therapeutic option. Within the last 20 years, a great variety of stem cells have been used in different myocardial infarction models. Up until now, the use of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) has seemed to be the best option, but the inaccessibility and scarcity of these cells make their use unreliable. Additionally, there is a high risk as they have to be obtained directly from the heart of the patient. Unlike CSCs, adult stem cells originating from bone marrow or adipose tissue, among others, appear to be an attractive option due to their easier accessibility and abundance, but particularly due to the probable existence of cardiac progenitors among their different sub-populations. In this review an analysis is made of the surface markers present in CSCs compared with other adult stem cells. This suggested the pre-existence of cells sharing specific surface markers with CSCs, a predictable immunophenotype present in some cells, although in low proportions, and with a potential of cardiac differentiation that could be similar to CSCs, thus increasing their therapeutic value.

In this study, we explored the role of interleukin-17 in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the underlying mechanisms. The level of IL-17 increased in both the serum and cardiac tissue of diabetic mice. Knockout of IL-17 improved cardiac function of diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ), and significantly alleviated interstitial fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen mRNA expression and collagen deposition evaluated by Masson's staining. High glucose treatment induced collagen production were abolished in cultured IL-17 knockout cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). The levels of long noncoding RNA-AK081284 were increased in the CFs treated with high glucose or IL-17. Knockout of IL-17 abrogated high glucose induced upregulation of AK081284. Overexpression of AK081284 in cultured CFs promoted the production of collagen and TGF\u03b21. Both high glucose and IL-17 induced collagen and TGF\u03b21 production were mitigated by the application of the siRNA for AK081284. In summary, deletion of IL-17 is able to mitigate myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac function of diabetic mice.

However, its pathogenesis is still not entirely understood. The aim of this paper was to explore the mechanisms and new drug targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model on H9C2 cells and the in vivo models on rats and mice were developed. The results showed that DOX markedly decreased H9C2 cell viability, increased the levels of CK, LDH, caused histopathological and ECG changes in rats and mice, and triggered myocardial oxidative damage via adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Total of 18 differentially expressed microRNAs in rat heart tissue caused by DOX were screened out using microRNA microarray assay, especially showing that miR-140-5p was significantly increased by DOX which was selected as the target miRNA. Double-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-140-5p directly targeted Nrf2 and Sirt2, as a result of affecting the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a, and thereby increasing DOX-caused myocardial oxidative damage. In addition, the levels of intracellular ROS were significantly increased or decreased in H9C2 cells treated with DOX after miR-140-5p mimic or miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection, respectively, as well as the changed expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2. Furthermore, DOX- induced myocardial oxidative damage was worsened in mice treated with miR-140-5p agomir, and however the injury was alleviated in the mice administrated with miR-140-5p antagomir. Therefore, miR-140-5p plays an important role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting myocardial oxidative stress via targeting Nrf2 and Sirt2.

Neurohumoral \u03b2-adrenergic signaling is a well-established mediator of ECC; other signaling mechanisms, such as paracrine signaling, have also demonstrated significant impact on ECC but are less well understood. For example, resident heart endothelial cells are well-known physiological paracrine modulators of cardiac myocyte ECC mainly via NO and endothelin-1. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated other resident noncardiomyocyte heart cells (eg, physiological fibroblasts and pathological myofibroblasts), and even experimental cardiotherapeutic cells (eg, mesenchymal stem cells) are also capable of altering cardiomyocyte ECC through paracrine mechanisms. In this review, we first focus on the paracrine-mediated effects of resident and therapeutic noncardiomyocytes on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, electrophysiology, and calcium handling, each of which can modulate ECC, and then discuss the current knowledge about key paracrine factors and their underlying mechanisms of action. Next, we provide a case example demonstrating the promise of tissue-engineering approaches to study paracrine effects on tissue-level contractility. More specifically, we present new functional and molecular data on the effects of human adult cardiac fibroblast conditioned media on human engineered cardiac tissue contractility and ion channel gene expression that generally agrees with previous murine studies but also suggests possible species-specific differences. By contrast, paracrine secretions by human dermal fibroblasts had no discernible effect on human engineered cardiac tissue contractile function and gene expression. Finally, we discuss systems biology approaches to help identify key stem cell paracrine mediators of ECC and their associated mechanistic pathways.

Due to the constellation of symptoms, the patient underwent genetic testing and a cardiac muscle biopsy. Genetic testing was significant for an Arg302Gln mutation in the PRKAG2 gene. Cardiac tissue biopsy revealed significant myocyte hypertrophy and large vacuoles with glycogen stores.\nThe pathologic and genetics findings of our patient are consistent with PRKAG2 syndrome.

{"title": "Phosphodiesterase 3A expression and activity in the murine vasculature is influenced by NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase.", "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) exists in two isoforms (PDE3A and PDE3B) and is known to act as cGMP-inhibited cAMP-degrading PDE. Therefore, PDE3 may likely be involved in the interaction between the two second messenger pathways. NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) is the most important cytosolic generator of cGMP. Here, we investigated the effect of NO-GC deletion on PDE3A-mediated signaling in animals lacking NO-GC either globally (GCKO) or specifically in smooth muscle cells (SMC-GCKO). PDE3A expression is detected in murine aortic smooth muscle, platelets, and heart tissue. Expression and activity of PDE3A in aortae from GCKO and SMC-GCKO mice was reduced by approx. 50% compared to that in control animals. PDE3A downregulation can be linked to the reduction in NO-GC and is not an effect of the increased blood pressure levels resulting from NO-GC deletion. Despite the different PDE3A expression levels, smooth muscle relaxation induced by forskolin to stimulate cAMP signaling was similar in all genotypes. Basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in aortic tissue were not different between KO and control strains. However, the potency of milrinone, a selective inhibitor of PDE3A, to induce relaxation was higher in aortae from GCKO and SMC-GCKO than that in aorta from control animals. These data were corroborated by the effect of milrinone in vivo, which led to an increase in systolic blood pressure in both KO strains but not in control mice. We conclude that NO-GC modulates PDE3A expression and activity in SMC in vivo conceivably to preserve functional cAMP signaling.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2018-01-03", "authors": ["SarahD\u00fcnnes", "BarbaraVoussen", "AnnemarieAue", "KajaGroneberg", "ViacheslavNikolaev", "DieterGroneberg", "AndreasFriebe"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-017-2106-8"}
{"title": "Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Trial of Passive Scattering Proton Therapy and Intensity-Modulated Photon Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.", "abstract": "Purpose This randomized trial compared outcomes of passive scattering proton therapy (PSPT) versus intensity-modulated (photon) radiotherapy (IMRT), both with concurrent chemotherapy, for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that PSPT exposes less lung tissue to radiation than IMRT and thereby reduces toxicity without compromising tumor control. The primary end points were grade \u2265 3 radiation pneumonitis (RP) and local failure (LF). Patients and Methods Eligible patients had stage IIB to IIIB NSCLC (or stage IV NSCLC with a single brain metastasis or recurrent lung or mediastinal disease after surgery) who were candidates for concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Pairs of treatment plans for IMRT and PSPT were created for each patient. Patients were eligible for random assignment only if both plans satisfied the same prespecified dose-volume constraints for at-risk organs at the same tumor dose. Results Compared with IMRT (n = 92), PSPT (n = 57) exposed less lung tissue to doses of 5 to 10 Gy(RBE), which is the absorbed Gy dose multiplied by the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) factor for protons; exposed more lung tissue to \u2265 20 Gy(RBE), but exposed less heart tissue at all dose levels between 5 and 80 Gy(RBE). The grade \u2265 3 RP rate for all patients was 8.1% (IMRT, 6.5%; PSPT, 10.5%); corresponding LF rates were 10.7% (all), 10.9% (IMRT), and 10.5% (PSPT). The posterior probability of IMRT being better than PSPT was 0.54. Exploratory analysis showed that the RP and LF rates at 12 months for patients enrolled before versus after the trial midpoint were 21.1% (before) versus 18.2% (after) for the IMRT group (P = .047) and 31.0% (before) versus 13.1% (after) for the PSPT group (P = .027).

The 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27) has a potent ability to alleviate I/R after cardiac transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-I/R injury effect of Hsp27 to elucidate the underling mechanisms.\nHeart grafts from BALB/c mice were preserved in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (control) or UW solution containing pAAV-Hsp27 (Hsp27 solution) at 4\u00b0C for 48 h and subsequently transplanted into syngeneic recipients for 72 h. The heart grafts were then collected for histopathological and gene expression analyses. An \nCold I/R caused severe morphologic myocardial injury of heart grafts from wild type C57BL/c mice, whereas grafts from Hsp27 preservation showed less damage as demonstrated by decreased cell apoptosis/death and the preservation of the normal structure of the heart. Hsp27 inhibited I/R-induced injury as indicated by the reduction in cardiac troponin I activities and decreased cardiac tissue levels of the proinflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. Hsp27 was further demonstrated to significantly inhibit nuclear translocation of p65 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) expression.\nThese results suggested that the cardioprotective effect of Hsp27 could be due to the suppression of the myocardial inflammatory response and apoptosis by blocking the NF-\u03baB-dependent pro-inflammatory and NF-\u03baB-dependent PUMA signaling pathways.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental pathology", "date": "2018-01-01", "authors": ["HaoJing", "GuangmeiZou", "FengjiHao", "HuiminWang", "ShizhongWang"], "doi": null}

In environments of stress or increased energy requirement, mitochondria are highly dynamic and can undergo biogenesis, fusion/fission, or autophagy. The transcription factor family, Kruppel-Like Factor (KLF), is necessary to carry out normal cellular processes from proliferation to differentiation.

A handful of evidence supports KLF4's involvement in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis in both healthy and cancer cells.

{"title": "High resolution 3D microscopy study of cardiomyocytes on polymer scaffold nanofibers reveals formation of unusual sheathed structure.", "abstract": "Building functional and robust scaffolds for engineered biological tissue requires a nanoscale mechanistic understanding of how cells use the scaffold for their growth and development. A vast majority of the scaffolds used for cardiac tissue engineering are based on polymer materials, the matrices of nanofibers. Attempts to load the polymer fibers of the scaffold with additional sophisticated features, such as electrical conductivity and controlled release of the growth factors or other biologically active molecules, as well as trying to match the mechanical features of the scaffold to those of the extracellular matrix, cannot be efficient without a detailed knowledge of how the cells are attached and strategically positioned with respect to the scaffold nanofibers at micro and nanolevel. Studying single cell - single fiber interactions with the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning probe nanotomography (SPNT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that cardiac cells actively interact with substrate nanofibers, but in different ways. While cardiomyocytes often create a remarkable \"sheath\" structure, enveloping fiber and, thus, substantially increasing contact zone, fibroblasts interact with nanofibers in the locations of focal adhesion clusters mainly without wrapping the fiber.\nWe found that cardiomyocytes grown on electrospun polymer nanofibers often create a striking \"sheath\" structure, enveloping fiber with the formation of a very narrow (\u223c22\u202fnm) membrane gap leading from the fiber to the extracellular space. This wrapping makes the entire fiber surface available for cell attachment. This finding gives a new prospective view on how scaffold nanofibers may interact with growing cells. It may play a significant role in effective design of novel nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering concerning mechanical and electrical properties of scaffolds as well as controlled drug release from \"smart\" biomaterials.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-12-31", "authors": ["VictorBalashov", "AntonEfimov", "OlgaAgapova", "AlexanderPogorelov", "IgorAgapov", "KonstantinAgladze"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.12.031"}

However, data related to calcium channel dysfunction in heart failure is divergent and contradictory ranging from reduced function to no change in the calcium current. Many recent studies have highlighted the importance of functional and spatial microdomains in the heart and that may be the key to answer several puzzling questions. In this review, we have briefly discussed the types of VGCCs found in heart tissues, their structure, and significance in the normal and pathological condition of the heart. More importantly, we have reviewed the modulation of VGCCs by \u03b2ARs in normal and pathological conditions incorporating functional and structural aspects. There are different types of \u03b2ARs, each having their own significance in the functioning of the heart.

However, the role of Pin1 in cardiac fibrosis remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the potential mechanism of Pin1 in isoprenaline (ISO)\u2011induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. Echocardiography was used to evaluate changes in the size, shape and function of the heart, and histological staining was performed to visualize inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunohistochemistry and Picrosirius red staining were used to differentiate collagen subtypes. Additionally, cardiac\u2011specific phosphorylation of mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase kinase\u00a01/2 (MEK1/2) and extracellular\u2011signal regulated protein kinase\u00a01/2 (ERK1/2), and the activities of Pin1 and \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2011SMA) and other oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the heart. The administration of ISO resulted in an increase in cardiac parameters and elevated the heart\u2011to\u2011body weight ratio. Histopathological examination of heart tissues revealed interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltrate and disorganized collagen fiber deposition. In addition, lipid peroxidation products and oxidative stress marker activity in plasma and tissues were significantly increased in the ISO\u2011treated rats. Western blot analysis showed significantly elevated protein levels of phosphorylated Pin1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and \u03b1\u2011SMA in remodeling hearts. Treatment with juglone following intraperitoneal injection of ISO significantly prevented inflammatory cell infiltration, improved cardiac function, and suppressed oxidative stresses and fibrotic alterations. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that the activation of Pin1 promoted cardiac extracellular matrix deposition and oxidative stress damage by regulating the phosphorylation of the MEK1/2\u2011ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the expression of \u03b1\u2011SMA. By contrast, the inhibition of Pin1 alleviated cardiac damage and fibrosis in the experimental models, suggesting that Pin1 contributed to the development of cardiac remodeling in ISO\u2011administered rats, and that the inactivation of Pin1 may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2017-12-30", "authors": ["XianWu", "MingjiangLi", "Su-QinChen", "ShaLi", "FurongGuo"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2017.3354\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2016.10.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.056952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0091877\n10.1016/j.imr.2014.10.002\n10.1042/CS20150502\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2016.06.020\n10.3390/ijms17122001\n10.1111/febs.13943\n10.1074/mcp.O116.063487\n10.1038/nrm2261\n10.1038/ncb0505-435\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.05.010\n10.1038/srep43639\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.12.025\n10.1038/nature01832\n10.1016/j.tibs.2011.07.001\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301084\n10.1074/jbc.M113.526442\n10.1016/j.fsi.2008.07.007\n10.1186/1472-6882-6-32\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005\n10.1016/j.jbior.2013.02.001\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu179\n10.1155/2014/260429\n10.1002/ejhf.430\n10.1172/JCI17664\n10.1126/science.1176009\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80273-1\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.03.018\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361\n10.1074/jbc.M111.313684\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.050\n10.1007/s00018-013-1321-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00110.2003\n10.1073/pnas.0610906104\n10.1002/humu.20748\n10.1093/cvr/cvq308\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166845\n10.1371/journal.pone.0150093\n10.1074/jbc.M009160200\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.582239\n10.1152/ajpheart.00023.2006\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01123-2\n10.1126/science.1135380"}

The aim of this study was (1) to investigate myocardial expression of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in relation to myocardial fibrosis in end-stage heart failure patients and (2) to study whether plasma sST2 is associated with histologically determined cardiac fibrosis. In 38 patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation, mRNA expression of sST2, total ST2, and IL-33 was measured in cardiac tissue obtained during the implantation. In the same tissue, histological fibrosis was digitally quantified and mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic signaling molecules, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21), was measured. In addition, plasma levels of sST2 were determined. Expression levels of IL-33/ST2 pathway factors in myocardial tissue were significantly associated with cardiac fibrosis and the expression levels of CTGF and TGF\u03b21. Plasma levels of sST2 did not correlate with tissue expression of ST2, the amount of fibrosis or myocardial expression of pro-fibrotic signaling proteins.

Our aim was to investigate whether uniaxial strain causes different changes in conduction velocity (\u03b8) when the principal strain axis is parallel vs perpendicular to impulse propagation.\nCardiomyocyte strands were cultured on stretchable custom microelectrode arrays, and \u03b8 was determined during steady-state pacing. Uniaxial strain (5%) with principal axis parallel (orthodromic) or perpendicular (paradromic) to propagation was applied for 1\u00a0minute and controlled by imaging a grid of markers. The results were analysed in terms of cable theory.\nBoth types of strain induced immediate changes of \u03b8 upon application and release. In material coordinates, orthodromic strain decreased \u03b8 significantly more (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) than paradromic strain (2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5% vs 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% in n\u00a0=\u00a08 mouse cardiomyocyte cultures, 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4% vs 0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5% in n\u00a0=\u00a04 rat cardiomyocyte cultures, respectively). The larger effect of orthodromic strain can be explained by the increase in axial myoplasmic resistance, which is not altered by paradromic strain. Thus, changes in tissue resistance substantially contributed to the changes of \u03b8 during strain, in addition to other influences (eg stretch-activated channels). Besides these immediate effects, the application of strain also consistently initiated a slow progressive decrease in \u03b8 and a slow recovery of \u03b8 upon release.\nChanges in cardiac conduction velocity caused by acute stretch do not only depend on the magnitude of strain but also on its orientation relative to impulse propagation. This dependence is due to different effects on tissue resistance.", "journal": "Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)", "date": "2017-12-29", "authors": ["ABuccarello", "MAzzarito", "FMichoud", "S PLacour", "J PKucera"], "doi": "10.1111/apha.13026"}

Gelatin and Laponite\u00ae were combined to formulate a shear-thinning, nanocomposite hydrogel (nSi Gel) as an injectable carrier of secretome (nSi Gel+). The growth factor composition and the pro-angiogenic activity of the secretome were tested in vitro by evaluating the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical endothelial cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the nSi Gel\u202f+\u202fsystem was then investigated in vivo in rats by intramyocardial injection into the peri-infarct region. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, scar formation, and heart function were assessed. Biocompatibility of the developed nSi Gel was confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical tests which showed no significant differences in the level of inflammatory genes, microRNAs, and cell marker expression compared to the untreated control group. In addition, the only group that showed a significant increase in capillary density, reduction in scar area and improved cardiac function was treated with the nSi Gel+. Our in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate the potential of this new secretome-loaded hydrogel as an alternative strategy to treat myocardial infarction.\nStem cell based-therapies represent a possible solution to repair damaged myocardial tissue by promoting cardioprotection, angiogenesis, and reduced fibrosis. However, recent evidence indicates that most of the positive outcomes are likely due to the release of paracrine factors (cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes) from the cells and not because of the local engraftment of stem cells. This cocktail of essential growth factors and paracrine signals is known as secretome can be isolated in vitro, and the biomolecule composition can be controlled by varying stem-cell culture conditions. Here, we propose a straightforward strategy to deliver secretome produced from hASCs by using a nanocomposite injectable hydrogel made of gelatin and Laponite\u00ae.

However, progression of right ventricle dysfunction is not always lung-dependent. Increased afterload caused by pulmonary vascular remodeling initiates the right ventricle hypertrophy, but determinants leading to adaptive or maladaptive hypertrophy and failure remain unknown. Ischemia in a hypertrophic right ventricle may directly contribute to right heart failure. Rapidly enlarging cardiomyocytes switch from aerobic to anaerobic energy generation resulting in cell growth under relatively hypoxic conditions. Cardiac muscle reacts to an increased afterload by over-activation of the sympathetic system and uncoupling and downregulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Recent studies suggest that \u03b2 blocker therapy in PH is safe, well tolerated, and preserves right ventricle function and cardiac output by reducing right ventricular glycolysis. Fibrosis, an evolutionary conserved process in host defense and wound healing, is dysregulated in maladaptive cardiac tissue contributing directly to right ventricle failure.

They can be used to gain insight into the physiology of the heart under these conditions while they are adaptable to computer assisted patient-specific clinical diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. Realistic cardiac mechanics models incorporate tissue active/passive response in conjunction with hyperelasticity and anisotropy. Conventional formulation of such models leads to mathematically-complex problems usually solved by custom-developed non-linear finite element (FE) codes. With a few exceptions, such codes are not available to the research community. This article describes a computational cardiac mechanics model developed such that it can be implemented using off-the-shelf FE solvers while tissue pathologies can be introduced in the model in a straight-forward manner. The model takes into account myocardial hyperelasticity, anisotropy, and active contraction forces. It follows a composite tissue modeling approach where the cardiac tissue is decomposed into two major parts: background and myofibers. The latter is modelled as rebars under initial stresses mimicking the contraction forces. The model was applied in silico to study the mechanics of infarcted left ventricle (LV) of a canine.

Mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is involved in the development of cardiac injury and is a component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the upstream activator of MKK7 and is specifically inhibited by 2,7-dihydro-2,7-dioxo-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (NQDI-1). This study investigates the role of ASK1, MKK7 and JNK during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Infarct size were measured in isolated male Sprague-Dawley rat Langendorff perfused hearts treated for 125\u202fmin with Sunitinib in the presence and absence of NQDI-1. Left ventricular cardiac tissue samples were analysed by qRT-PCR for MKK7 mRNA expression and cardiotoxicity associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) or Western blot analysis to measure ASK1/MKK7/JNK phosphorylation. Administration of Sunitinib (1\u202f\u03bcM) during Langendorff perfusion resulted in increased infarct size, increased miR-133a expression, and decreased phosphorylation of the ASK1/MKK7/JNK pathway compared to control. Co-administration of NQDI-1 (2.5\u202f\u03bcM) attenuated the increased Sunitinib-induced infarct size, reversed miR-133a expression and restored phosphorylated levels of ASK1/MKK7/JNK. These findings suggest that the ASK1/MKK7/JNK intracellular signalling pathway is important in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity.

Methods. To isolate the exclusive effect of GPx3 deficiency in kidney disease-induced cardiac disease, we studied the GPx3 knockout mouse strain (GPx3-/-) in the setting of surgery-induced CKD. Results. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) microarray screening of non-stimulated GPx3-/- heart tissue show increased expression of genes associated with cardiomyopathy including myh7, plac9, serpine1 and cd74 compared with wild-type (WT) controls. GPx3-/- mice underwent surgically induced renal mass reduction to generate a model of CKD. GPx3-/-\u2009+\u2009CKD mice underwent echocardiography 4\u2009weeks after injury. Fractional shortening (FS) was decreased to 32.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8% in GPx3-/- +\u2009CKD compared to 62.0% \u00b1 10.3 in WT\u2009+\u2009CKD (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Platelet aggregates were increased in the myocardium of GPx3-/-\u2009+\u2009CKD. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels were increased in both GPx3-/-\u2009+\u2009CKD and WT+\u2009CKD. ADMA stimulated spontaneous platelet aggregation more quickly in washed platelets from GPx3-/-. In vitro platelet aggregation was enhanced in samples from GPx3-/-\u2009+ CKD. Platelet aggregation in GPx3-/-\u2009+\u2009CKD samples was mitigated after in vivo administration of ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic. FS improved in GPx3-/-\u2009+\u2009CKD mice after ebselen treatment.\nThese results suggest GPx3 deficiency is a substantive contributing factor to the development of kidney disease-induced cardiac disease.", "journal": "Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association", "date": "2017-12-16", "authors": ["PaulPang", "MollyAbbott", "MalyunAbdi", "Quynh-AnhFucci", "NikitaChauhan", "MurtiMistri", "BrandonProctor", "MatthewChin", "BinWang", "WenqingYin", "Tzong-ShiLu", "ArvinHalim", "KennethLim", "Diane EHandy", "JosephLoscalzo", "Andrew MSiedlecki"], "doi": "10.1093/ndt/gfx304"}

Firstly, we studied the effect of bioprinted microchanneled hydrogel on the alignment, elongation, and differentiation of hMSC. Notably, the cells displayed well defined F-actin anisotropy and elongated morphology on the microchanneled hydrogel, hence showing the effects of topographical control over cell behavior. Furthermore, the aligned stem cells showed myocardial lineage commitment, as detected using mature cardiac markers. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis also confirmed a significant increase in the commitment towards myocardial tissue lineage. Moreover, seeded CMs were found to be more aligned and demonstrated synchronized beating on microchanneled hydrogel as compared to the unpatterned hydrogel. Overall, our study proved that microchanneled hydrogel scaffold produced by 3D bioprinting induces myocardial differentiation of stem cells as well as supports CMs growth and contractility.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have cardioprotective effects. However, it remains unclear whether miR-21 was involved in the mechanism of cardiac fibrosis with DN by target MMP-9 and ARB ameliorates cardiac fibrosis partly by inhibiting miR-21 expression. In this study, In Situ Hybridization(ISH), RT-PCR, cell transfection, western blotting and laser confocal telescope were used, respectively. ISH showed that miR-21, concentrated in cytoplasmic foci in the proximity of the nucleus, was mainly localized in cardiac fibroblasts and at relatively low levels in cardiomyocytes within cardiac tissue with DN. RT-PCR showed that miR-21 expression was significantly enhanced in cardiac tissue with DN, accompanied by the increase of col-IV, FN, CVF, PVCA, LVMI, HWI and NT-pro-BNP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that MMP-9 was a validated target of miR-21. Furthermore, cell transfection experiments showed that miR-21 overexpression directly decreased MMP-9 expression.

Cardiotoxicity is determined by cardiac exposure to anthracyclines and to more toxic secondary alcohol metabolites that are formed inside cardiomyocytes or diffuse from the bloodstream. Concerns exist that HF might be caused by cumulative anthracycline doses that were thought to be safe. Patients with gain-of-function polymorphism of carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3), which converts anthracyclines to secondary alcohol metabolites, would be at a higher risk of HF. Recently, a pharmacokinetic model was developed that simulated clinical exposure of human myocardium to anthracyclines and incorporated simulations of CBR3 polymorphism. It was shown that HF risk could occur after lower doxorubicin doses than previously reported, particularly for patients with CBR3 polymorphism. In this study, we show that also daunorubicin and idarubicin, but not epirubicin, might cause HF after reportedly safe cumulative doses. CBR3 polymorphism increased HF risk from daunorubicin and idarubicin to a greater extent as compared with doxorubicin. This was caused by daunorubicin and idarubicin forming higher levels of toxic metabolites in human myocardium; moreover, daunorubicin and idarubicin metabolites diffused from plasma and accumulated in cardiac tissue, whereas doxorubicin metabolite did not. CBR3 polymorphism did not aggravate HF risk from epirubicin, which was caused by the very low levels of formation of its toxic metabolite.

Cardiac injury involves the release of various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including heparan sulfate (HS), a constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM), through the TLR4 receptor activation triggering a strong inflammatory response, inducing leukocytes recruitment. This latter cells are responsible of clearing cell debris and releasing cytokines that promote CF differentiation to myofibroblast (CMF), thus initiating scar formation. CF were isolated from adult male rats and subsequently stimulated with HS or LPS, in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitors, to evaluate signaling pathways involved in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were used to evaluate participation of these adhesion molecules on leukocytes recruitment. HS through TLR4, PI3K/AKT and NF-\u039aB increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, which favored the adhesion of spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) and bone marrow granulocytes (PMN) to CF. These effects were prevented by siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Co-culture of CF with SMC increased \u03b1-SMA expression, skewing CF towards a pro-fibrotic phenotype, while CF pretreatment with HS partially reverted this effect.\nThese data show the dual role of HS during the initial stages of wound healing.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that it is a multi-system disorder, particularly in its severe forms. Several studies delineated structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in SMA patients and mouse models, yet the abnormalities have been primarily attributed to autonomic dysfunction. Here, we show in a severe mouse model that its cardiomyocytes undergo G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis during postnatal development. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that a set of genes associated with cell cycle and apoptosis were dysregulated in newborn pups. Of particular interest, the Birc5 gene, which encodes Survivin, an essential protein for heart development, was down-regulated even on pre-symptomatic postnatal day 0. Interestingly, cultured cardiomyocytes depleted of SMN recapitulated the gene expression changes including downregulation of Survivin and abnormal cell-cycle progression; and overexpression of Survivin rescued the cell-cycle defect. Finally, increasing SMN in SMA mice with a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide improved heart pathology and recovered expression of deregulated genes.

After 30\u00a0min of stabilization, the hearts were subjected to global ischaemia for 20\u00a0min and reperfused for 45\u00a0min. Baseline cardiac function was assessed by measuring four parameters: LVDP (mmHg), heart rate (bpm), +\u00a0dP/dt and -\u00a0dP/dt (mmHg/s). After reperfusion, the total protein from cardiac ventricles was obtained, and the Akt signalling pathway and NO production were evaluated. Post-ischaemic functional recovery was significantly greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the T3-treated WT mice compared to the control, demonstrating the cardioprotective effect of T3. This effect was abolished in T3-treated KO mice, demonstrating the physiological relevance of AT2R to the cardioprotective phenotype induced by T3. Akt activation, iNOS expression and NO production increased in cardiac tissue after T3 treatment in the WT animals, but no difference was observed after treatment in the KO mice.

Myricetin could inhibit the nuclear translocation of p65, degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and cellular apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.

Of the many available interventions after a myocardial infarction, such as percutaneous intervention or pharmacological optimization, none can reverse the ischemic insult on the heart and restore cardiac function. Thus, the only available cure for patients with scarred myocardium is allogeneic heart transplantation, which comes with extensive costs, risks, and complications. However, multiple studies have shown that the heart is, in fact, not an end-stage organ and that there are endogenous mechanisms in place that have the potential to spark regeneration. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential tool to tap into and activate this endogenous framework. Particularly promising are stem cells derived from cardiac tissue itself, referred to as cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). CDCs can be extracted and isolated from the patient's myocardium and then administered by intramyocardial injection or intracoronary infusion. After early success in the animal model, multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of autologous CDC therapy in humans. Clinical trials with allogeneic CDCs showed early promising results and pose a potential \"off-the-shelf\" therapy for patients in the acute setting after a myocardial infarction. The mechanism responsible for CDC-induced cardiac regeneration seems to be a combination of triggering native cardiomyocyte proliferation and recruitment of endogenous progenitor cells, which most prominently occurs via paracrine effects.

{"title": "Preconditioned augmented Lagrangian formulation for nearly incompressible cardiac mechanics.", "abstract": "Computational modeling of the heart is a subject of substantial medical and scientific interest, which may contribute to increase the understanding of several phenomena associated with cardiac physiological and pathological states. Modeling the mechanics of the heart have led to considerable insights, but it still represents a complex and a demanding computational problem, especially in a strongly coupled electromechanical setting. Passive cardiac tissue is commonly modeled as hyperelastic and is characterized by quasi-incompressible, orthotropic, and nonlinear material behavior. These factors are known to be very challenging for the numerical solution of the model. The near-incompressibility is known to cause numerical issues such as the well-known locking phenomenon and ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix. In this work, the augmented Lagrangian method is used to handle the nearly incompressible condition. This approach can potentially improve computational performance by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix and thereby improving the convergence of iterative solvers. We also improve the performance of iterative solvers by the use of an algebraic multigrid preconditioner. Numerical results of the augmented Lagrangian method combined with a preconditioned iterative solver for a cardiac mechanics benchmark suite are presented to show its improved performance.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": ["Joventino OliveiraCampos", "Rodrigo WeberDos Santos", "JoakimSundnes", "Bernardo MartinsRocha"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.2948"}
{"title": "AT1 receptor blockage impairs NF-\u03baB activation mediated by thyroid hormone in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that calcium-binding protein S100A8 and myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) are important mediators of nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) activation in cardiomyocytes and that signalling molecules are involved in the hypertrophic response that is stimulated by thyroid hormones (TH). Angiotensin II (Ang II), the main active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), binds to type 1 Ang II receptor (AT1R) and subsequently promotes cardiac hypertrophy and the inflammatory response with NF-\u03baB activation underlying the cardiovascular effects. Considering the amount of evidence that RAS is an important mediator of TH actions on the cardiovascular system, we aimed to investigate whether cardiac expression of NF-\u03baB and upstream associated molecules could be altered in hyperthyroidism, as well as whether AT1R could mediate the effects of TH on cardiac tissue and in cardiomyocytes in culture. Wistar rats were subjected to hyperthyroidism with or without the AT1R blocker losartan. The TH serum levels, haemodynamic parameters and cardiac mass were assessed to confirm the hyperthyroid status. The S100A8, MyD88 and nuclear NF-\u03baB expression levels were increased in the hearts of the hyperthyroid rats, and the losartan treatment attenuated these TH effects. In addition, the cultured cardiomyocytes that had been stimulated with losartan exhibited blunted S100A8 upregulation and NF-\u03baB activation compared with the TH-treated cells. Together, our results suggest that AT1R participates in TH-induced cardiac hypertrophy partly by mediating S100A8, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB activation via TH. These findings indicate the important crosstalk between TH and RAS, highlighting the participation of AT1R in the triggered mechanisms of TH that contribute to the cardiac hypertrophy response.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2017-11-28", "authors": ["Ana Paula CremascoTakano", "NathaliaSenger", "Carolina DemarchiMunhoz", "Maria Luiza MoraisBarreto-Chaves"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-017-2088-6"}

We investigated the time frame in which these chemical signals are triggered after heat stress (41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0\u0421/45\u00a0min), single or repeated (24 or 72\u00a0h after the first one) in heart tissue of male Wistar rats. The animals were allowed to recover 24, 48 or 72\u00a0h at room temperature. Single heat stress caused a significant increase of the concentration of HSP70, NO, and PKC level and decrease of COX-2 level 24\u00a0h after the heat stress, which in the next course of recovery gradually normalized. The second heat stress, 24\u00a0h after the first one, caused a significant reduction of the HSP70 levels, concentration of NO and PKC\u025b, and significant increase of COX-2 concentration. The second exposure, 72\u00a0h after the first heat stress, caused more expressive changes of HSP70 and NO in the 24\u00a0h-recovery groups. The level of PKC\u025b was not significantly changed, but there was significantly increased COX-2 concentration during recovery. Serum activity of AST, ALT, and CK was reduced after single exposure and increased after repeated exposure to heat stress, in both time intervals.

Drug cardiac metabolism, passive diffusion, active efflux, and uptake were included in the model as mechanisms involved in the drug disposition within the heart. The model accounted for inter-individual variability. The estimates of optimized parameters were within physiological ranges. The model performance was verified by simulating 5 clinical studies of amitriptyline intravenous infusion, and the simulated pharmacokinetic profiles agreed with clinical data.

The Mesenchyme homeobox 1 (Meox1) gene is one of the foetal programme genes. Meox1 may play a role in embryonic development, but its regulation of pathological hypertrophy is not known. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of Meox1 on pathological hypertrophy, including familial and pressure overload-induced hypertrophy, and its potential mechanism of action.\nMeox1 expression was markedly down-regulated in the wild-type adult mouse heart with age, and expression was up-regulated in heart tissues from familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) mice of the cTnTR141W strain, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) mice of the cTnTR92Q strain, pressure overload-induced HF mice, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. Echocardiography, histopathology, and hypertrophic molecular markers consistently demonstrated that Meox1 overexpression exacerbated the phenotypes in FHCM and in mice with thoracic aorta constriction (TAC), and that Meox1 knockdown improved the pathological changes. Gata4 was identified as a potential downstream target of Meox1 using digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, real-time PCR, and bioinformatics analysis. Promoter activity data and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Gata4 knockdown analyses indicated that Meox1 acted via activation of Gata4 transcription.\nMeox1 accelerated decompensation via the downstream target Gata4, at least in part directly.

Metformin and melatonin were administered 12\u00a0days before and 16\u00a0weeks after the carcinogen. During the experiment, all animals were fed a high fat diet (10% total fat, 2.5% from lard, and 7.5% from palm oil). The findings are that mammary carcinogenesis generated oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, estimated from thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), oxidatively modified protein content (aldehyde and ketone derivatives), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase were all augmented. Metformin caused a decrease in oxidative stress in the heart, accompanied by a decrease in diene conjugates, the elimination of ROS (stable total antioxidant status), and the activation of catalase and glutathione reductase. Melatonin caused an increase in total antioxidant status and a substantial reduction in ROS as estimated from aldehyde and ketone derivatives, lipid peroxidation at the initial (diene conjugates) and terminal stages (TBARS), and increased catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Metformin and melatonin combined reversed the effects of NMU on oxidative stress. In conclusion, melatonin reduces the level of oxidative stress in the heart tissue, caused by NMU carcinogenesis and a high fat diet, significantly stronger than metformin.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": ["NataliaKurhaluk", "BiankaBojkova", "MarekRadkowski", "Olga VZaitseva", "SvitlanaKyriienko", "UrszulaDemkow", "Pawel JWinklewski"], "doi": "10.1007/5584_2017_128"}
{"title": "MicroRNAs as predictive biomarkers for myocardial injury in aged mice following myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "The occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) increases appreciably with age. In the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of MI more than doubles for men and increases more than five-fold in women (ages 55-64 years compared to 85-94 years). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) quantitatively regulate their target's expression post-transcriptionally by either silencing action through binding at the 3'UTR domains or degrading the messages at their coding regions. In either case, these regulations affect the cardiac transcriptional output and cardiac function. Among the known cardiac associated miRNA, miRNA-1, miRNA-133a, and miRNA-34a have been shown to induce adverse structural remodeling to impair cardiac contractile function. In the present study, an in vivo model of MI in young (3 month) and old (22 month) mice is used to investigate the possible role whereby these three miRNAs exert negative effects on heart function following MI. Herein we demonstrate that in older mouse heart, all three microRNAs show increased levels of expression, while miRNA-1 shows a further increase in old mouse heart following MI, which corresponds to left ventricular (LV) wall thinning. These structural changes in cardiac tissue may causes downstream LV dilation and subsequent LV dysfunction.

To this end, we have developed a system to characterize our bioartificial heart model and compare them to functional native structures. In the present study, the hearts of adult Sprague-Dawley were decellularized resulting in a natural three-dimensional cardiac scaffold. Neonatal rat primary cardiac cells were then cultured within a complex 3D fibrin gel, forming a 3-dimensional cardiac construct, which was sutured to the acellular scaffold and suspended in media for 24-48\u00a0h. The resulting bioartificial hearts (BAHs) were then affixed with 16 electrodes, in different configurations to evaluate not only the electrocardiographic characteristics of the cultured tissues, but to also test the system's consistency. Histological evaluation showed cellularization and cardiac tissue formation. The BAHs and native hearts were then evaluated with our 16-channel flexible system to acquire the metrics associated with their respective electrophysiological properties. Time delays between the native signals were in the range of 0-95\u00a0ms. As well, color maps revealed a trend in impulse propagation throughout the native hearts.

In the present study, the anti-fibrosis-associated cardioprotective effects of matrine on DbCM were investigated. Rats with experimental DbCM were administered matrine orally. Cardiac functions were evaluated using invasive hemodynamic examinations. Cardiac compliance was assessed in isolated hearts. Using Sirius Red and fluorescence staining, the collagen in diabetic hearts was visualized. MTT assay was used to select non\u2011cytotoxic concentrations of matrine, which were subsequently used to treat isolated cardiac fibroblasts incubated under various conditions. Western blotting was performed to assess activation of the transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21)/Smad signaling pathway. Rats with DbCM exhibited impaired heart compliance and left ventricular (LV) functions. Excessive collagen deposition in cardiac tissue was also observed. Furthermore, TGF\u2011\u03b21/R\u2011Smad (Smad2/3) signaling was revealed to be markedly activated; however, the expression of inhibitory Smad (I\u2011Smad, also termed Smad7) was reduced in DbCM.

Heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HT(x)) was used as a model for heart unloading. Cardiac atrophy was assessed from the ratio of the native- to-transplanted heart weight (HW). The degree of cardiac atrophy after HT(x) was determined on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after HT(x) in recipients of either healthy or failing hearts. HT(x) of healthy hearts resulted in 23+/-3, 46+/-3, 48+/-4 and 46+/-4 % HW loss at the four time-points. HT(x) of the failing heart resulted in even greater HW losses, of 46+/-4, 58+/-3, 66+/-2 and 68+/-4 %, respectively (P<0.05). Activation of \"fetal gene cardiac program\" (e.g. beta myosin heavy chain gene expression) and \"genes reflecting cardiac remodeling\" (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression) after HT(x) was greater in failing than in healthy hearts (P<0.05 each time). Exposure to isocaloric high sugar diet caused significant increases in fatty acid concentrations in healthy and in failing hearts. However, these increases were not associated with any change in the course of cardiac atrophy, similarly in healthy and post-HT(x) failing hearts.

By cross bone marrow transplantation experiments, we determined that TNC deposition relied on cardiac cells and not on haematopoietic cells. The expression of TNC induced by TAC, or by administration of a recombinant lentivector coding for TNC, triggered a pro-inflammatory cardiac microenvironment, monocyte/macrophage (MO/M\u03a6) accumulation, and systolic dysfunction. TNC modified macrophage polarization towards the pro-inflammatory phenotype and stimulated RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathways to promote mesenchymal to amoeboid transition that enhanced macrophage migration into fibrillar collagen matrices. The amplification of inflammation and MO/M\u03a6 recruitment by TNC was abrogated by genetic invalidation of TNC in knockout mice. These mice showed less ventricular remodelling and an improved cardiac function after TAC as compared with wild-type mice.\nBy promoting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment and macrophage migration, TNC appears to be a key factor to enable the MO/M\u03a6 accumulation within fibrotic hearts leading to cardiac dysfunction.

The present study aimed to investigate how MLT protects the heart through modulating myocardial apoptosis in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In total, 36 rats were randomly divided into three groups, including control (n=12), DM (n=12) and DM\u00a0+\u00a0MLT (n=12) groups. The results demonstrated that, in DM rats, a significant increase was observed in the serum fasting blood glucose and lipid levels, in addition to insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction, which were attenuated in DM rats treated with MLT. Additionally, cellular apoptosis in rats with DM was increased, and the expression of Bcl\u20112 was downregulated, while levels of Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X and caspase\u20113 were upregulated, and these observations were reversed by MLT, as determined by TUNEL and western blot analysis, respectively. As increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by hyperglycemia is reported to be a factor for apoptosis, the present study also determined the expression of proteins associated with ER stress in cardiac tissues following MLT treatment by western blotting. The results further indicated that MLT decreased the expression of ER stress hallmarks, including CCAAT/enhancer\u2011binding protein homologous protein, glucose\u2011regulated protein 78, protein kinase RNA\u2011like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6\u03b1 in cardiac tissues.

Viral myocarditis (VMC) characterized by viral-myocardial-cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration is a common clinical disease of the cardiovascular system. However, the role of Sema7A in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced VMC has not been reported. In this study, we generated an acute VMC mouse model by CVB3 infection, and manipulated Sema7A expression by in vivo polyethyleneimine-mediated Sema7A down-regulation. Our results indicated that Sema7A was up-regulated in cardiomyocytes during VMC, and that Sema7A down-regulation following short hairpin RNA interference or mAb neutralization effectively protected mice from VMC. Additionally, reduced inflammatory responses were observed along with Sema7A down-regulation. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages exacerbated CVB3-induced myocarditis, suggesting the significance of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages in response to VMC. We observed that co-culture of neonatal myocardiocytes with macrophages increased the percentage of \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages, while Sema7A neutralization reduced \u03b11\u03b21-integrin macrophages in heart tissue of VMC mice. These results demonstrated that Sema7A, as an inflammation regulator in CVB3-induced VMC, might interact with \u03b11\u03b21-integrin in macrophages to enhance the inflammatory response and aggravate disease severity.

Previous research showed that absence of Grx2, leads to impaired mitochondrial complex I function, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in mice but the impact on mitochondrial structure and function in intact cardiomyocytes and in humans has not been explored. We hypothesized that Grx2 controls cardiac mitochondrial dynamics and function in cellular and mouse models, and that low expression is associated with human cardiac dysfunction. Here we show that Grx2 absence impairs mitochondrial fusion, ultrastructure and energetics in primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue. Moreover, provision of the glutathione precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to Grx2-/- mice did not restore glutathione redox or prevent impairments. Using genetic and histopathological data from the human Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium we demonstrate that low GRX2 is associated with fibrosis, hypertrophy, and infarct in the left ventricle.

{"title": "Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Inducers of Heme Oxygenase-1 That Protect Human iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes from Oxidative Stress.", "abstract": "Oxidative injury to cardiomyocytes plays a critical role in cardiac pathogenesis following myocardial infarction. Transplantation of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has recently progressed as a novel treatment to repair damaged cardiac tissue but its efficacy has been limited by poor survival of transplanted cells owing to oxidative stress in the post-transplantation environment. Identification of small molecules that activate cardioprotective pathways to prevent oxidative damage and increase survival of stem cells post-transplantation is therefore of great interest for improving the efficacy of stem cell therapies. This report describes a chemical biology phenotypic screening approach to identify and validate small molecules that protect human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from oxidative stress. A luminescence-based high-throughput assay for cell viability was used to screen a diverse collection of 48,640 small molecules for protection of hiPSC-CMs from peroxide-induced cell death. Cardioprotective activity of \"hit\" compounds was confirmed using impedance-based detection of cardiomyocyte monolayer integrity and contractile function. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the identification of a potent class of compounds with 4-(pyridine-2-yl)thiazole scaffold. Examination of gene expression in hiPSC-CMs revealed that the hit compound, designated cardioprotectant 312 (CP-312), induces robust upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, a marker of the antioxidant response network that has been strongly correlated with protection of cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress. CP-312 therefore represents a novel chemical scaffold identified by phenotypic high-throughput screening using hiPSC-CMs that activates the antioxidant defense response and may lead to improved pharmacological cardioprotective therapies.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2017-11-05", "authors": ["R JasonKirby", "Daniela BDivlianska", "KanupriyaWhig", "NadezdaBryan", "Camilo JMorfa", "AdaKoo", "Kevin HNguyen", "PatrickMaloney", "SatayamaheshwarPeddibhotla", "E HamptonSessions", "Paul MHershberger", "Layton HSmith", "SiobhanMalany"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.117.243717"}

We investigated whether prolonged exposure to a low dose of VEGF could be achieved by encapsulating VEGF in polylactic coglycolic acid nanoparticles and whether treatment with VEGF-containing nanoparticles improved cardiac function and protected against left ventricular remodeling in the hearts of mice with experimentally induced myocardial infarction. Polylactic coglycolic acid nanoparticles with a mean diameter of ~113 nm were generated via double emulsion and loaded with VEGF; the encapsulation efficiency was 53.5 \u00b1 1.7% (107.1 \u00b1 3.3 ng VEGF/mg nanoparticles). In culture, VEGF nanoparticles released VEGF continuously for at least 31 days, and in a murine myocardial infarction model, VEGF nanoparticle administration was associated with significantly greater vascular density in the peri-infarct region, reductions in infarct size, and improvements in left ventricular contractile function 4 wk after treatment. Thus, our study provides proof of principle that nanoparticle-mediated delivery increases the angiogenic and therapeutic potency of VEGF for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-characterized proangiogenic cytokine but has a short half-life and a rapid clearance rate.

{"title": "Cardiac oxidative stress following maternal separation stress was mitigated following adolescent voluntary exercise in adult male rat.", "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) is known as a risk factor for the development of depression and its associated comorbidities, such as cardiomyopathy in depressed patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression and cardiovascular diseases. Evidence indicates that regular physical activity has therapeutic effects on both mood and cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, the voluntary running wheel exercise (RW) during adolescence may be able to attenuate the negative impact of maternal separation stress (MS) as a valid animal model of depression on the behavior and cardiac mitochondrial function of adult rats. To do this, we applied MS to rat pups by separating them from their mothers for 180min during the postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 14. Next, the animals were randomly divided into different treatment groups (fluoxetine [FLX] and RW) and received the treatments during adolescence, between PND 28 to PND 60. Then, we evaluated the effects of MS on the rat behaviors test, and finally, we assessed reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial glutathione, ATP and cytochrome c release in the cardiac tissue of animals. Our results showed that depressive-like behaviors following MS in adult male rats were associated with oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. Further, we found that treating animals with chronic FLX or RW during adolescence improved animal's behavior as well as cardiac mitochondrial function. The results of this study highlight the importance of adolescence as a period during which treating animals with non-pharmacological agents has significant protective effects against the negative influence of ELS on mood and cardiac energy hemostasis.", "journal": "Physiology & behavior", "date": "2017-10-25", "authors": ["EhtramolsadatSahafi", "MaghsoudPeeri", "Mir-JamalHosseini", "Mohammad AliAzarbayjani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.10.022"}
{"title": "Label-free imaging of redox status and collagen deposition showing metabolic differences in the heart.", "abstract": "The heart has high metabolic demand to maintain function. The primary source of energy supply to support correct contractile muscle function differs between a fetus and an adult. In fetal life, ATP is primarily generated by glycolysis and lactate oxidation, whereas following birth, there is a shift towards a reliance on mitochondrial metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. This change in metabolic status is an adaptation to different fuel availability, oxygenation and growth patterns. In this study, we have employed 2-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to define the relationship between two critical metabolic cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(P)H and flavin adenine dinucleotide, effectively utilizing a redox ratio to differentiate between the metabolic status in fetal (proliferative) and adult (quiescent/hypertrophic) hearts. Two-photon imaging was also used to visually confirm the known increase in collagen deposition in the adult heart. The changes observed were consistent with a hypertrophic growth profile and greater availability of fatty acids in the adult heart, compared to the proliferative fetal heart. Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy is therefore a convenient imaging technology that enables the monitoring of striated muscle architecture and the metabolic status of heart tissue. This imaging technology can potentially be employed to visualize cardiac and other muscle pathologies.", "journal": "Journal of biophotonics", "date": "2017-10-24", "authors": ["Janna LMorrison", "AlexandraSorvina", "Jack R TDarby", "Christie ABader", "Mitchell CLock", "MikeSeed", "TimKuchel", "Sally EPlush", "Douglas ABrooks"], "doi": "10.1002/jbio.201700242"}

Under the hypothesis that electrical synchronization of cardiac cells can be aided by conductive materials, electrically conductive scaffolds have been frequently used to improve cardiac tissue regeneration. However, theoretical analysis is presently absent in examining the underlying mechanism and rationally guiding the design of these conductive scaffolds.\nhere, equivalent-circuit models are proposed, in which two adjacent groups of cardiomyocytes are grown either on a bulk conductive substrate or around conductive nanostructures. When one group of cells leads with action potentials, the membrane depolarization of the following group is investigated.\nthis study reveals that membrane depolarization of the following group is most sensitive to seal resistance to the substrate while surface roughness and conductivity of the material have less influence. In addition, it is found that a multiple-cell group is easier to be depolarized by its adjacent beating cardiomyocytes. For nanostructure-bridged cardiac cells, substantial depolarization occurs only with a seal resistance larger than 10\nthis work theoretically confirms the positive role of conductive scaffolds and nanostructures in aiding electrical synchronization of cardiac cells and reveals that its performance mainly relies on the cell-device interface.\nthis work provides a theoretical basis for the rational design of electroactive scaffolds for enhanced cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-10-21", "authors": ["YuWu", "LiangGuo"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2764000"}
{"title": "Protein/polysaccharide-based scaffolds mimicking native extracellular matrix for cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has emerged as a viable approach to treat disease or repair damage in tissues and organs. One of the key elements for the success of tissue engineering is the use of a scaffold serving as artificial extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM hosts the cells and improves their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, enabling the formation of new tissue. Here, we propose the development of a class of protein/polysaccharide-based porous scaffolds for use as ECM substitutes in cardiac tissue engineering. Scaffolds based on blends of a protein component, collagen or gelatin, with a polysaccharide component, alginate, were produced by freeze-drying and subsequent ionic and chemical crosslinking. Their morphological, physicochemical, and mechanical properties were determined and compared with those of natural porcine myocardium. We demonstrated that our scaffolds possessed highly porous and interconnected structures, and the chemical homogeneity of the natural ECM was well reproduced in both types of scaffolds. Furthermore, the alginate/gelatin (AG) scaffolds better mimicked the native tissue in terms of interactions between components and protein secondary structure, and in terms of swelling behavior. The AG scaffolds also showed superior mechanical properties for the desired application and supported better adhesion, growth, and differentiation of myoblasts under static conditions. The AG scaffolds were subsequently used for culturing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, where high viability of the resulting cardiac constructs was observed under dynamic flow culture in a microfluidic bioreactor. We therefore propose our protein/polysaccharide scaffolds as a viable ECM substitute for applications in cardiac tissue engineering. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "UV-Assisted 3D Bioprinting of Nanoreinforced Hybrid Cardiac Patch for Myocardial Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Biofabrication of cell supportive cardiac patches that can be directly implanted on myocardial infarct is a potential solution for myocardial infarction repair. Ideally, cardiac patches should be able to mimic myocardium extracellular matrix for rapid integration with the host tissue, raising the need to develop cardiac constructs with complex features. In particular, cardiac patches should be electrically conductive, mechanically robust and elastic, biologically active and prevascularized. In this study, we aim to biofabricate a nanoreinforced hybrid cardiac patch laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) with improved electrical, mechanical, and biological behavior. A safe ultraviolet (UV) exposure time with insignificant effect on cell viability was identified for methacrylated collagen (MeCol) micropatterning. The effects of carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on MeCol and alginate matrix morphology, mechanical properties, electrical behavior, and cellular response were investigated at different CNT mass ratios. A UV-integrated 3D-bioprinting technique was implemented to create hybrid hydrogel constructs consisting of CNT-incorporated alginate framework and cell-laden MeCol. The compressive modulus, impedance, and swelling degree of hybrid constructs were assessed over 20 days of incubation in culture medium at 37\u00b0C for different CNT mass ratios. The HCAEC viability, proliferation, and differentiation in the context of the bioprinted hybrid constructs were assessed over 10 days in vitro. The functionalized CNTs provided a highly interconnected nanofibrous meshwork that significantly improved viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of photo-cross-linked MeCol. Alginate-coated CNTs provided a nanofilamentous network with fiber size of \u223c25-500\u2009nm, improving not only electrical and mechanical properties but also HCAEC attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate. The CNT-reinforced 3D-printed hybrid constructs presented significantly higher stiffness and electrical conductivity particularly in the physiologically relevant frequency range (\u223c5\u2009Hz). The CNT-reinforced hybrid implants maintained a significantly higher swelling degree over 20 days of culturing compared to CNT-free hybrid constructs. For a selected CNT mass ratio, HCAECs presented significant cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (lumen-like formation) over 10 days of incubation in vitro.

{"title": "The histopathologic reliability of tissue taken from cadavers within the gross anatomy laboratory.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the histopathologic reliability of embalmed cadaveric tissue taken from the gross anatomy laboratory. Tissue samples from hearts, livers, lungs, and kidneys were collected after the medical students' dissection course was completed. All of the cadavers were embalmed in a formalin-based fixative solution. The tissue was processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at six micrometers, and stained with H&E. The microscope slides were evaluated by a board certified pathologist to determine whether the cellular components of the tissues were preserved at a high enough quality to allow for histopathologic diagnosis. There was a statistically significant relationship between ratings and organ groups. Across all organs, there was a smaller proportion of \"poor\" ratings. The lung group had the highest percentage of \"poor\" ratings (23.1%). The heart group had the least \"poor\" ratings (0.0%). The largest percentage of \"satisfactory\" ratings were in the lung group (52.8%), and the heart group contained the highest percentage of \"good\" ratings (58.5%) The lung group had the lowest percentage of \"good\" ratings (24.2%).

Osteopontin (OPN) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that orchestrates mechanisms controlling cell recruitment and cardiac architecture. Our main goal was to study the role of endogenous OPN as a modulator of myocardial CCL5 chemokine and MMP-2 metalloproteinase, and its pathological impact in a murine model of Chagas heart disease. Wild-type (WT) and OPN-deficient (spp1 -/-) mice were parasite-infected (Brazil strain) for 100days. Both groups developed chronic myocarditis with similar parasite burden and survival rates.

Intense OPN labeling was observed in inflammatory cells recruited to infected heart (P<0.05). Plasma concentration of MMP-2 was higher (P<0.05) in infected WT than in spp1 -/- mice. Coincidently, specific immunostaining revealed increased gelatinase expression (P<0.01) and activity (P<0.05) in the inflamed hearts from T. cruzi WT mice, but not in their spp1 -/- littermates.

{"title": "Regulating microRNA expression: at the heart of diabetes mellitus and the mitochondrion.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus results in a systemic milieu of increased circulating glucose and fatty acids. The development of insulin resistance in cardiac tissue decreases cellular glucose import and enhances mitochondrial fatty acid uptake. While triacylglycerol and cytotoxic lipid species begin to accumulate in the cardiomyocyte, the energy substrate utilization ratio of free fatty acids to glucose changes to almost entirely free fatty acids. Accumulating evidence suggests a role of miRNA in mediating this metabolic transition. Energy substrate metabolism, apoptosis, and the production and response to excess reactive oxygen species are regulated by miRNA expression. The current momentum for understanding the dynamics of miRNA expression is limited by a lack of understanding of how miRNA expression is controlled. While miRNAs are important regulators in both normal and pathological states, an additional layer of complexity is added when regulation of miRNA regulators is considered. miRNA expression is known to be regulated through a number of mechanisms, which include, but are not limited to, epigenetics, exosomal transport, processing, and posttranscriptional sequestration. The purpose of this review is to outline how mitochondrial processes are regulated by miRNAs in the diabetic heart.

Although accumulating evidences indicate that gene expression is regulated by hypoxia stress in fish, how genes undergoing differential gene expression and/or alternative splicing (AS) in response to hypoxia stress in heart are not well understood. Using RNA-seq, we surveyed and detected 289 differential expressed genes (DEG) and 103 genes that undergo differential usage of exons and splice junctions events (DUES) in heart of a hypoxia tolerant fish, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus following 12h hypoxic treatment. The spatio-temporal expression analysis validated the significant association of differential exon usages in two randomly selected DUES genes (fam162a and ndrg2) in 5 tissues (heart, liver, brain, gill and spleen) sampled at three time points (6h, 12h, and 24h) under acute hypoxia treatment. Functional analysis significantly associated the differential expressed genes with the categories related to energy conservation, protein synthesis and immune response. Different enrichment categories were found between the DEG and DUES dataset. The Isomerase activity, Oxidoreductase activity, Glycolysis and Oxidative stress process were significantly enriched for the DEG gene dataset, but the Structural constituent of ribosome and Structural molecule activity, Ribosomal protein and RNA binding protein were significantly enriched only for the DUES genes. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals abundant stress responsive genes and their differential regulation function in the heart tissues of Nile tilapia under acute hypoxia stress. Our findings will facilitate future investigation on transcriptome complexity and AS regulation during hypoxia stress in fish.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2017-10-08", "authors": ["Jun HongXia", "Hong LianLi", "Bi JunLi", "Xiao HuiGu", "Hao RanLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.002"}
{"title": "The SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683, prevents Angiotensin II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "abstract": "Inflammation has emerged as a critical biological process contributing to hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Effective pharmacological treatments targeting the cardiac inflammatory response, however, are still lacking. Prior studies suggested that the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) plays a key role in inflammation and cardiac remodeling. Recently, a highly selective SGK1 inhibitor, EMD638683, was developed, though whether EMD638683 can prevent hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis and the mechanisms by which this inhibitor may alter the disease process remain unknown. Using a murine Angiotension II (Ang II) infusion-induced hypertension model we found that EMD638683 treatment inhibited cardiac fibrosis and remodeling, with significant abatement of cardiac inflammation. EMD638683 was shown to suppress Ang II infusion-induced interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 release, and substantially reduce nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) expression and caspase-1 activation in cardiac tissues. In vitro experiments revealed that EMD638683 ameliorated Ang II-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. By reducing IL-1\u03b2 production in macrophages, the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was inhibited. The effects of EMD638683 on cardiac fibrosis were abolished by supplementation with exogenous IL-1\u03b2. Administration of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 indicated that EMD638683 attenuated Ang II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis. These findings indicate that the SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683 can negatively regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and may represent a promising approach to the treatment of hypertensive cardiac damage.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

SVFs have cardiomyogenic potential, and many researchers have examined the possibility of SVF transplantation for heart disease. In cell-based therapies, donor age affects the regenerative capability, cell yield, and differentiation potential of adult tissues; however, opposing or controversial results have been found in humans. We examined whether SVF transplantation into impaired heart tissue shows differential effects according to donor age. Methods We investigated differences in protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with adipose-derived adherent stromal cells (ADASs) from donors of different ages [>40-year-olds (40s group) and >60-year-olds (60s group)] under oxidative stress conditions. Results Although co-culturing HUVECs with ADASs ameliorated inflammation due to increased oxidative stress conditions, few differences were observed between the ADASs from the 40s and 60s groups. Moreover, the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery classification tool revealed differentially expressed genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in response to ADASs.

{"title": "Development of In Vitro Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity Assay by Using Three-Dimensional Cardiac Tissues Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.", "abstract": "An in vitro drug-induced cardiotoxicity assay is a critical step in drug discovery for clinical use. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is promising for this purpose. However, single hiPSC-CMs are limited in their ability to mimic native cardiac tissue structurally and functionally, and the generation of artificial cardiac tissue using hiPSC-CMs is an ongoing challenging. We therefore developed a new method of constructing three-dimensional (3D) artificial tissues in a short time by coating extracellular matrix (ECM) components on cell surfaces. We hypothesized that 3D cardiac tissues derived from hiPSC-CMs (3D-hiPSC-CT) could be used for an in vitro drug-induced cardiotoxicity assay. 3D-hiPSC-CT were generated by fibronectin and gelatin nanofilm coated single hiPSC-CMs. Histologically, 3D-hiPSC-CT exhibited a sarcomere structure in the myocytes and ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, collagen type I/III, and laminin. The administration of cytotoxic doxorubicin at 5.0\u2009\u03bcM induced the release of lactate dehydrogenase, while that at 2.0\u2009\u03bcM reduced the cell viability. E-4031, human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-type potassium channel blocker, and isoproterenol induced significant changes both in the Ca transient parameters and contractile parameters in a dose-dependent manner. The 3D-hiPSC-CT exhibited doxorubicin-sensitive cytotoxicity and hERG channel blocker/isoproterenol-sensitive electrical activity in vitro, indicating its usefulness for drug-induced cardiotoxicity assays or drug screening systems for drug discovery.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

However, the antiarrhythmic mechanism of left stellectomy is not well known. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP) is a complex immune mechanism that regulates peripheral inflammatory responses.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of left stellectomy on CAIP using rat experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) models.\nEAM was produced by injecting 2 mg of porcine cardiac myosin into the footpads of rats. Left stellectomy was performed before EAM induction. We evaluated the effect of left stellectomy on arrhythmic events, survival, inflammation, and CAIP in rats without and with EAM.\nLeft stellectomy prevented arrhythmia and improved survival in EAM rats. Left stellectomy decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 6, and high mobility group box 1 (P\u00a0< .05 vs EAM) in serum and heart tissues from EAM rats. In heart rate variability analysis, high-frequency peaks of the power spectrum\u00a0densities, reflecting parasympathetic cardiovagal tone, were significantly decreased in EAM rats, but increased after left stellectomy. The ratios of phosphorylated STAT3/STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and phosphorylated JAK2/JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) decreased in cell lysates of the spleen, liver, and heart in EAM rats. However, the same ratios significantly increased after left stellectomy. Nuclear factor \u03baB in cell lysates of the spleen, liver, and heart increased in EAM rats, but decreased after left stellectomy.\nIn EAM models, left stellectomy increased survival of the rats while showing antiarrhythmic effects with reduced inflammation via activation of the JAK2-STAT3-mediated signaling cascade.

{"title": "Osteoglycin prevents the development of age-related diastolic dysfunction during pressure overload by reducing cardiac fibrosis and inflammation.", "abstract": "The small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin has been implicated in matrix homeostasis in different organs, including the ischemic heart. However, whether osteoglycin modulates cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis or inflammation in hypertensive heart disease and during aging remains unknown. Angiotensin-II-induced pressure overload increases cardiac osteoglycin expression, concomitant with the onset of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition. Interestingly aging led to decreased cardiac levels of osteoglycin, yet absence of osteoglycin did not affect organ structure or cardiac function up to the age of 18months. However, Angiotensin-II infusion in combination with aging resulted in exaggerated cardiac fibrosis and inflammation in the osteoglycin null mice as compared to wild-type mice, resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro, stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophages from osteoglycin null mice with Angiotensin-II resulted in significantly higher levels of ICAM-1 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 as compared to WT cells. Further, stimulation of human cardiac fibroblasts with osteoglycin reduced cell proliferation and inhibited TGF-\u03b2 induced collagen gene expression. In mouse cardiac tissue, osteoglycin expression inversely correlated with TGF-\u03b2 expression and in cardiac biopsies of aortic stenosis patients, osteoglycin expression is significantly higher than in control biopsies. Interestingly, osteoglycin levels were higher in patients with less severe myocardial fibrosis and overall in the aortic stenosis patients osteoglycin levels negatively correlated with collagen content in the myocardium. In conclusion, osteoglycin expression is increased in the heart in response to pressure overload and its absence results in increased cardiac inflammation and fibrosis resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction.", "journal": "Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "date": "2017-09-30", "authors": ["SophieDeckx", "WardHeggermont", "PaoloCarai", "MariekeRienks", "TomDresselaers", "UweHimmelreich", "Rickvan Leeuwen", "WiesLommen", "Jolandavan der Velden", "ArantxaGonzalez", "JavierDiez", "Anna-PiaPapageorgiou", "StephaneHeymans"], "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2017.09.002"}
{"title": "Development of next generation cardiovascular therapeutics through bio-assisted nanotechnology.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) rank, next to cancer and stroke, among the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the major CVDs, acute myocardial infarction is a life-threatening disorder resulting from permanent damage to the left ventricular cardiac tissue. The major coronary arteries that supply blood to the functional left ventricle become blocked due to thrombotic plaque occlusion. During myocardial ischemia, oxidative stress and free radicals destroy healthy cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, followed by degradation of the extracellular matrix, which results in ventricular wall-thinning and dilation. To protect the left ventricle from further damage and to rescue ischemic cardiac tissue, specially designed scaffolds consisting of biological material and nanomaterials have been developed. At the preclinical level, scaffolds loaded with growth factors and cells have been shown to regenerate ischemic tissue into healthy, functional myocardium. In this review, different therapeutic strategies currently available to treat the disease conditions at various stages are discussed, with special emphasis on biomaterials. Recent advancements in cardiovascular therapeutics using graphene and exosomal nanovesicles are discussed in detail. In addition, future directions for the development of next-generation cardiovascular therapeutics with biological and non-biological materials through nano-assisted technology are explored. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Protective molecular mechanisms of clusterin against apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Loss of cardiomyocytes occurs with aging and contributes to cardiovascular complications. In the present study, we highlighted the role of clusterin, a protein that has recently been associated with the protection of cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. Clusterin protects cardiac cells against damage from myocardial infarction, transplant, or myocarditis. Clusterin can act directly or indirectly on apoptosis by regulating several intracellular pathways. These pathways include (1) the oxidant and inflammatory program, (2) insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway, (3) KU70 / BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) pathway, (4) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) pathway, (5) BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) pathway, and (6) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

Although one method for detecting myocardial ischaemia involves changes in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram, the relationship between these changes and subendocardial ischaemia is not fully understood. In this study, we modelled ST-segment epicardial potentials in a slab model of cardiac ventricular tissue, with a central ischaemic region, using the bidomain model, which considers conduction longitudinal, transverse and normal to the cardiac fibres. We systematically quantified the effect of uncertainty on the input parameters, fibre rotation angle, ischaemic depth, blood conductivity and six bidomain conductivities, on outputs that characterise the epicardial potential distribution. We found that three typical types of epicardial potential distributions (one minimum over the central ischaemic region, a tripole of minima, and two minima flanking a central maximum) could all occur for a wide range of ischaemic depths. In addition, the positions of the minima were affected by both the fibre rotation angle and the ischaemic depth, but not by changes in the conductivity values. We also showed that the magnitude of ST depression is affected only by changes in the longitudinal and normal conductivities, but not by the transverse conductivities.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2017-09-22", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston", "SamCoveney", "Eugene T YChang", "Peter RJohnston", "Richard HClayton"], "doi": "10.1007/s11517-017-1714-y\n10.1109/TBME.1970.4502713\n10.21914/anziamj.v53i0.5101\n10.1198/TECH.2009.08019\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.03.009\n10.1161/CIRCEP.108.830133\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130252\n10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011283\n10.1161/01.RES.68.5.1241\n10.1016/j.ress.2008.10.008\n10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9\n10.1109/TBME.2007.900563\n10.1007/s11538-009-9421-y\n10.1186/1475-925X-6-21\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.161075\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2004.04072.x\n10.1007/s10439-005-3236-2\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2498144\n10.1080/10255840903067072\n10.1109/TBME.2002.807660\n10.1109/10.966596\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.018\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.002\n10.1161/01.RES.42.5.603\n10.4065/mcp.2009.0560\n10.1114/1.1408923\n10.1161/01.RES.82.9.957\n10.1109/TMI.2012.2192743\n10.1109/TBME.2005.844270\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2005.06.095\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.12.002\n10.1111/j.1467-9868.2004.05304.x\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.022\n10.1007/s11517-007-0276-9\n10.1161/01.RES.44.5.701\n10.1161/01.RES.50.3.342\n10.1007/BF02368018\n10.1109/10.563303\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1997.tb00835.x\n10.1109/10.844235\n10.1161/01.RES.12.1.40\n10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.056\n10.1007/s10439-005-7257-7\n10.1007/BF02430957\n10.1161/01.RES.24.3.339\n10.1007/s10439-011-0391-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.90.6.3076\n10.1007/s00791-002-0082-8\n10.1137/040615201"}

In this study, we evaluated the time course changes in mitochondrial performance and oxidative stress in house mice following X-irradiation. Forty-eight mice were equally divided among six groups, including a nonirradiated control and five experimental groups that varied in time between X-ray exposure and euthanasia (1 h and 1, 4, 7, and 10 days after X-irradiation). We measured parameters associated with mitochondrial respiratory function and ROS emission from isolated liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria and levels of oxidative damage and antioxidants in liver, skeletal muscle, and heart tissues. Mitochondrial function dropped initially after X-irradiation but recovered quickly and was elevated 10 days after the exposure. Hydrogen peroxide production, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation showed inverse U-shaped curves, with levels returning to control or lower than control, 10 days after X-irradiation. Enzymatic antioxidants and markers for mitochondrial biogenesis exhibited a tissue-specific response after irradiation. These data provide the first chronological description of the mitohormetic response after a mild dose of irradiation and highlight the protective response that cells display to ROS exposure.

Termination of electrical pacing resulted in spontaneous positive shift of resting membrane potential (RMP) in AZV. Boradrenaline induced biphasic effects on RMP in all quiescent AZV preparations but only in 25% preparations-bursts of spontaneous AP, which were suppressed by both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Phenylephrine induced additional depolarization of RMP in quiescent AZV preparations, while isoproterenol caused hyperpolarization.

Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern CSC biology and their role in myocardial regeneration will allow the design and development of optimal therapeutic interventions. It is now evident that different growth factors and cytokines govern CSC survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation, as well as playing a role in activating cardiac repair mechanisms such as improving angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte survival and limiting fibrosis. This review article will summarize the evidence for a role of VEGF, NRG-1, IGF-1, HGF, EGF, FGF and TGF-\u03b21 in modulating the repair and regeneration of cardiac tissue.

Related with this, research has focused on cellular, biochemical, molecular and structural changes in heart tissue induced by PDE4s inhibitors. However, for their clinical applicability additional studies are still needed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy offers promising approach to contribute such issue due to its ability in detection the changes in biomolecules. By utilizing this method, we examined the effects of PDE4 inhibition by rolipram at 0.05 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg doses on content of lipids and proteins, and fluidity, order and packing of membranes in naive mice heart. In treated groups, there was a significant decrease in unsaturated, saturated lipids, cholesterol esters, fatty acids, phospholipids and triacylgylcerols obtained from CH2, C=O, olefinic=CH, and COO- areas, and CH2/lipid, C=O/lipid, olefinic=CH/lipid, and COO-/lipid ratios. Additionally, olefinic=CH area and olefinic=CH/lipid ratio may suggest decreased lipid peroxidation, confirmed by thiobarbituric acid assay. Also, a higher degree of membrane order, slight increase in membrane fluidity and differences in membrane packing were obtained. Amide I and II areas and RNA/protein ratios showed that variation in protein content is not correlated with applied concentration. Analysis of amide I mode predicted alterations in secondary structures like an increase in random coils and decrease in alpha-helices.

{"title": "G3BP2 is involved in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy through activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.", "abstract": "The RasGAP SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BPs) are a family of RNA-binding proteins that can co-ordinate signal transduction and post-transcriptional gene regulation. G3BPs have been shown to be involved in mediating a great diversity of cellular processes such as cell survival, growth, proliferation and apoptosis. But the potential roles of G3BPs in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular diseases remain to be clarified. In the present study, we provide the first evidence that suggests the participation of G3BP2 in cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), treatment with isoproterenol (ISO, 0.1-100 \u03bcmol/L) significantly elevated the mRNA and protein levels of G3BP2. Similar results were observed in the hearts of rats subjected to 7D-injection of ISO, accompanied by obvious heart hypertrophy and elevated the expression of hypertrophy marker genes ANF, BNP and \u03b2-MHC in heart tissues. Overexpression of G3BP2 in NRCMs led to hypertrophic responses evidenced by increased cellular surface area and the expression of hypertrophy marker genes, whereas knockdown of G3BP2 significantly attenuated ISO-induced hypertrophy of NRCMs. We further showed that G3BP2 directly interacted with I\u03baB\u03b1 and promoted the aggregation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in the nucleus and increased NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional activity. NF-\u03baB inhibition with PDTC (50 \u03bcmol/L) or p65 knockdown significantly decreased the hypertrophic responses in NRCMs induced by ISO or G3BP2 overexpression.

To evaluate the effect of astaxanthin on ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction, 18 aged Long Evans male rats were evenly divided into three groups. Group I (Control group) was given only the laboratory-ground food and normal water. Group II (ISO group) was administered ISO at a dose of 50 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for two weeks. Group III (Astaxanthin + ISO group) was treated with astaxanthin (25 mg/kg) orally every day and ISO 50 mg/kg SC twice a week for two weeks. ISO administration in rats increased the heart and left ventricular wet weights and increased inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Moreover, ISO administration increased the lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities in heart tissues. Astaxanthin treatment prevented the increased wet weight of heart and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. The protective effect of astaxanthin was associated with reduction of free radicals by improving antioxidant enzyme function, as well as normalization and/or suppression of elevated oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and advanced protein oxidation product (APOP) in ISO-administered rats. Furthermore, astaxanthin decreased the elevated activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and creatinin kinase muscle/brain (CK-MB) in ISO-administered rats.

To date, the efficiency of this approach in preclinical applications is limited in part by our incomplete understanding of the inflammatory environment known to be present at the site of myocardial infarct and by poor vascularization. It was recently reported that polarized macrophages known to be present at the site of myocardial infarction secrete bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)-2 and -4 causing changes in the expression of cardiac proteins in a 2D in vitro model. Here, these findings were extended towards cardiac tissues composed of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes embedded in collagen gel. By preconditioning cardiac tissues with BMPs, constructs were obtained with enhanced expression of cardiac markers. Additionally, after BMP preconditioning, the resulting cardiac-tissues were able to sustain diffusion of the BMPs with the added benefit of supporting human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation. Here, a model is proposed of cardiac tissues preconditioned with BMPs that results in stimulation of cardiomyocyte function and diffusion of BMPs able to support angiogenesis.

However, the isolation and expansion of CSCs prior to cell transplantation is time consuming, costly and invasive, and the reliability of cell expansion may also prove to be a major obstacle in the clinical application of CSC-based transplantation therapy after a myocardial infarction. In order to overcome this, we propose the incorporation of growth factor-eluting alginate microparticles into collagen-based scaffolds as an implantable biomaterial to promote the recruitment and expansion of CSCs in the myocardium. In order to obtain scaffolds able to enhance the motogenic and proliferative potential of CSCs, the aim of this work was to achieve a sustained delivery of both hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1. Both proteins were initially encapsulated in alginate microparticles by spray drying and subsequently incorporated into a collagen scaffold. Microparticles were seen to homogeneously distribute through the interconnected scaffold pore structure. The resulting scaffolds were capable of extending the release of both proteins up to 15\u00a0days, a three-fold increase over non-encapsulated proteins embedded in the scaffolds. In vitro assays with isolated CSCs demonstrated that the sustained release of both bioactive proteins resulted in an increased motogenic and proliferative effect. As presently practiced, the isolation and expansion of CSCs for autologous cell transplantation is slow, expensive and difficult to attain. Thus, there is a need for strategies to specifically activate in situ the intrinsic cardiac regenerative potential represented by the CSCs using combinations of growth factors obviating the need for cell transplantation. By favouring the natural regenerative capability of CSCs, it is hypothesized that the cardiac patch presented here will result in positive therapeutic outcomes in MI and heart failure patients in the future.

Given the critical role of three-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) in evaluation of nanoparticles toxicology, it remained necessary to understand the effects of IRONs on IDs assembly of cardiomyocytes in 3D environment. In this study, we first reconstituted collagen/Matrigel based ECTs in vitro and prepared IRONs with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-IRONs). We found that the internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner was not associated with the cell distribution in 3D environment by determination of Prussian blue staining and transmission electronic microscopy. Significantly, through determination of western blotting and immunofluorescence of connexin 43, N-cadherin, desmoplakin, and plakoglobin, DMSA-IRONs enhanced the assembly of gap junctions, decreased mechanical junctions (adherens junctions and desmosomes) of cardiac cells but not in dose-dependent manner in ECTs at seventh day. In addition, DMSA-IRONs increased the vesicles secretion of cardiac cells in ECTs apparently compared to control groups. Overall, we conclude that the internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner enhanced the assembly of electrochemical junctions and decreased the mechanical related microstructures. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Afterward, offspring were fed either a low- or a control zinc diet until 81\u00a0days of life. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels, TUNEL assay, TGF-\u03b21 expression, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances that determine lipoperoxidation damage, NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide anion production, antioxidant and nitric oxide synthase activity, mRNA and protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and serine1177 phosphorylation isoform were determined in left ventricle.\nZinc deficiency activated apoptotic and inflammatory processes and decreased TGF-\u03b21 expression and nitric oxide synthase activity in cardiac tissue of both sexes. Male zinc-deficient rats showed no changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, but a lower serine1177 phosphorylation. Zinc deficiency induced an increase in antioxidant enzymes activity and no differences in lipoperoxidation products levels in males. Females were less sensitive to this deficiency exhibiting lower increase in apoptosis, lower decrease in expression of TGF-\u03b21, and higher antioxidant and nitric oxide enzymes activities. A zinc-adequate diet during postnatal life reversed most of these mechanisms.\nPrenatal and postnatal zinc deficiency induces alterations in cardiac apoptotic, inflammatory, oxidative, and nitric oxide pathways that could predispose the onset of cardiovascular diseases in adult life.", "journal": "European journal of nutrition", "date": "2016-11-09", "authors": ["Lorena VanesaJuriol", "Mar\u00eda NataliaGobetto", "FacundoMendes Garrido Abreg\u00fa", "Marina ErciliaDasso", "GonzaloPineda", "LeandroG\u00fcttlein", "AndreaCarranza", "OsvaldoPodhajcer", "Jorge EduardoToblli", "RosanaElesgaray", "Cristina TeresaArranz", "Anal\u00eda LorenaTomat"], "doi": "10.1007/s00394-016-1343-5"}
{"title": "Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), a promising new material for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) is currently a prime focus of research because of an enormous clinical need. In the present work, a novel functional material, poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO), a medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), produced using bacterial fermentation, was studied as a new potential material for CTE. Engineered constructs with improved mechanical properties, crucial for supporting the organ during new tissue regeneration, and enhanced surface topography, to allow efficient cell adhesion and proliferation, were fabricated. Results showed that the mechanical properties of the final patches were close to that of cardiac muscle. Biocompatibility of neat P(3HO) patches, assessed using neonatal ventricular rat myocytes (NVRM), showed that the polymer was as good as collagen in terms of cell viability, proliferation and adhesion. Enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation properties were observed when porous and fibrous structures were incorporated into the patches. In addition, no deleterious effect was observed on adult cardiomyocyte contraction when cardiomyocytes were seeded on the P(3HO) patches. Hence, P(3HO)-based multifunctional cardiac patches are promising constructs for efficient CTE. This work will have a positive impact on the development of P(3HO) and other PHAs as a novel new family of biodegradable functional materials with huge potential in a range of different biomedical applications, particularly CTE, leading to further interest and exploitation of these materials.

{"title": "Periodontal Bacterial DNA and Their Link to Human Cardiac Tissue: Findings of a Pilot Study.", "abstract": "The aim of this pilot study was to detect correlations of microbiological DNA, inflammatory proteins, and infection parameters in patients with periodontal disease (PD) and valvular heart disease (VHD).\nA perioperative comprehensive dental examination for the investigation of periodontal status, including sampling of specific subgingival bacteria, was performed in 10 patients with indication for surgery of aortic valve stenosis with or without concomitant myocardial revascularization. Standard protocol biopsies were taken from right atrium (A), left septal myocardium (M), and aortic valve (V). Eleven periodontal pathogens DNA in oral and cardiac tissue samples (A/M/V) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction. For cardiac tissue samples, Western blot analysis of LPS-binding protein (LBP), immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of LBP-big42, LPS-binding protein receptor (CD14), and macrophages (CD68), as well as inflammation scoring measurement were performed.\nPeriodontitis was present in all patients with severe intensity in 7, moderate in 2 and mild in one patient. Same bacterial DNA was detected in A, M, and V in different distribution, and detection was more often in atrium than in myocardium or valve tissue. Morphological investigation revealed increased extracellular inflammatory cell migration. In IHC markers of LBP, CD68 and CD14 showed positive findings for all patients in atrium and myocardium.\nOur results demonstrate the presence of oral bacterial DNA in human cardiac tissue, as well as inflammatory markers potentially indicating connection of PD and VHD. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these preliminary data.", "journal": "The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["DirkZiebolz", "ChristophRost", "JuliaSchmidt", "ReginaWaldmann-Beushausen", "Friedrich ASch\u00f6ndube", "Rainer FMausberg", "Bernhard CDanner"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0035-1564689"}
{"title": "Doxorubicin Action on Mitochondria: Relevance to Osteosarcoma Therapy?", "abstract": "The mitochondria may very well determine the final commitment of the cell to death, particularly in times of energy stress. Cancer chemotherapeutics such as the anthracycline doxorubicin perturb mitochondrial structure and function in tumour cells, as evidenced in osteosarcoma, for which doxorubicin is used clinically as frontline therapy. This same mechanism of cell inhibition is also pertinent to doxorubicin's primary cause of side-effects, that to the cardiac tissue, culminating in such dire events as congestive heart failure. Reactive oxygen species are partly to blame for this effect on the mitochondria, which impact the electron transport chain.\nAs this review highlights that, there is much more to be learnt about the mitochondria and how it is affected by such effective but toxic drugs as doxorubicin.\nSuch information will aid researchers who search for cancer treatment able to preserve mitochondrial number and function in normal cells.", "journal": "Current drug targets", "date": "2015-04-18", "authors": ["JoArmstrong", "Crispin RDass"], "doi": "10.2174/1389450116666150416115852"}
