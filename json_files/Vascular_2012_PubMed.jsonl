{"title": "Arterial Patterns of the Face in Camelidamorpha.", "abstract": "Arteries supplying the intermandibular, mental, masseteric, buccal, labial, and nasal regions of the face in selected species belonging to the suborder Tylopoda are described in this study. Analyses were conducted on a total of five species representing the family Camelidae based on 27 heads of cadaveric specimens, which were prepared by arterial injection with acetone-dissolved stained vinyl super chloride or stained latex LBS3060. Vascularization of regions of the face was formed by the facial, sublingual, mental, transverse facial, buccal, and infraorbital arteries. It was confirmed that the linguofacial trunk is absent in Camelidae. In turn, in camels the deep temporal artery descended in the common trunk with the transverse facial artery, while in llamas and alpacas it was a direct branch of the maxillary artery. It was shown that the pattern of facial arteries in Camelidamorpha exhibits specific traits for this clade and differs from the system of these arteries in other artiodactyls. The described specific character in arterial vascularization of the face not only expands the spectrum of morphological characteristics in Camelidae, but it also provides information which may prove useful for clinical purposes in veterinary practice.

The aim of this study was to develop a new type of artificial bone by transferring the VEGF gene into marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and seeding them into a porous scaffold.\nAn adenovirus vector was employed to transfer the VEGF gene into MSCs and expression of the exogenous gene was confirmed by ELISA. Next the transduced cells were seeded into a collagen I modified PLGA/TCP scaffold. The constructed new complex artificial bone was then assessed for biocompatibility in vitro and blood vessel formation and bone formation in vivo.\nWe found that adenovirus mediated VEGF gene transfer into MSCs sustained VEGF expression in MSCs for 3 weeks. Porous scaffold PLGA/TCP made by rapid prototyping technology exhibited improved biocompatibility resulting from crosslinking with collagen I. Furthermore, the in vivo study showed that large amounts of blood vessels were detected histologically 1 week after artificial bone implantation, and significant bone formation was detected 8 weeks after implantation.\nOur findings suggest that gene transfer of VEGF into MSCs combined with PLGA/TCP scaffold enhances bone repair in vivo by promoting vascularization.", "journal": "Archives of medical science : AMS", "date": "2014-04-05", "authors": ["ChunguangDuan", "JianLiu", "ZhiYuan", "GuolinMeng", "XiumeiYang", "ShuaijunJia", "JinkangZhang", "ShiChen"], "doi": "10.5114/aoms.2012.30950"}

A 67-year-old man with cervical myeloradiculopathy had a large extramedullary tumor of the cervical spinal canal extending from C4 to C7. On MRI the tumor was isointense on T1-sequences and hypointense on T2-sequences, and had marked contrast enhancement. At surgery, the tumor was intradural extramedullary, with no dural or root attachment, but it was adherent to the cord. Complete tumor removal was achieved with good outcome. A 75-year-old man with progressive thoracic myelopathy had an intramedullary tumor at C6 and C7 level, which was hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images of MRI. At surgery, the tumor was intramedullary and strongly adherent to the cord; it was successfully removed. Both tumors were composed of elongated cells with a collagen-matrix background. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for vimentin, CD34, and bcl-2, and negative for EMA and S-100 protein. A careful analysis of our own and the other reported cases of spinal SFTs may disclose some peculiar features of this rare tumor. A spinal intramedullary or extramedullary tumor, hypointense on T2-weighted images of MRI, which intraoperatively shows hard consistency, scarce vascularization, no nerve root involvement, no or weak dural attachment, absence of arachnoidal interface, and adherence to the spinal cord may suggest the diagnosis of SFT.", "journal": "The neuroradiology journal", "date": "2013-09-14", "authors": ["GMariniello", "MNapoli", "CRusso", "FBriganti", "AGiamundo", "FMaiuri", "M LDel Basso De Caro"], "doi": "10.1177/197140091202500516"}

{"title": "The endocrine pancreas: insights into development, differentiation, and diabetes.", "abstract": "In the developing embryo, appropriate patterning of the endoderm fated to become pancreas requires the spatial and temporal coordination of soluble factors secreted by the surrounding tissues. Once pancreatic progenitor cells are specified in the developing gut tube epithelium, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, as well as a cascade of transcription factors, subsequently delineate three distinct lineages, including endocrine, exocrine, and ductal cells. Simultaneous morphological changes, including branching, vascularization, and proximal organ development, also influence the process of specification and differentiation. Decades of research using mouse genetics have uncovered many of the key factors involved in pancreatic cell fate decisions. When pancreas development or islet cell functions go awry, due to mutations in genes important for proper organogenesis and development, the result can lead to a common pancreatic affliction, diabetes mellitus. Current treatments for diabetes are adequate but not curative. Therefore, researchers are utilizing the current understanding of normal embryonic pancreas development in vivo, to direct embryonic stem cells toward a pancreatic fate with the goal of transplanting these in vitro generated 'islets' into patients. Mimicking development in vitro has proven difficult; however, significant progress has been made and the current differentiation protocols are becoming more efficient.

To evaluate the delivery efficiency, it is important to predict the distribution of NPs within blood vessels. NP size, shape and vessel geometry are believed to influence its biodistribution in circulation. Whereas, the effect of size on nanoparticle distribution has been extensively studied, little is known about the shape and vessel geometry effect. This paper describes a computational model for NP transport and distribution in a mimetic branched blood vessel using combined NP Brownian dynamics and continuum fluid mechanics approaches. The simulation results indicate that NPs with smaller size and rod shape have higher binding capabilities as a result of smaller drag force and larger contact area. The binding dynamics of rod-shaped NPs is found to be dependent on their initial contact points and orientations to the wall. Higher concentration of NPs is observed in the bifurcation area compared to the straight section of the branched vessel. Moreover, it is found that P\u00e9clet number plays an important role in determining the fraction of NPs deposited in the branched region and the straight section. Simulation results also indicate that NP binding decreases with increased shear rate. Dynamic NP re-distribution from low to high shear rates is observed due to the non-uniform shear stress distribution over the branched channel.

{"title": "[Pre-hospital management of adults with life-threatening emergencies].", "abstract": "In France, acute life-threatening situations are handled by the French Secours a Personne (assistance to persons) and emergency medical facilities. An unequivocal success, this early management of life-threatening emergency situations relies upon centralized call reception, medical dispatching, and immediate on-site emergency medical care. We describe the different emergency care providers and steps involved in the response to emergency situations. Each call centre (Samu, phone number 15; Sapeurs-Pompiers, 18) provides a response tailored to the nature of incoming calls for assistance. A check-list of grounds for an \"automatic response\" by the SDIS (Service D\u00e9partemental d'Incendie et de Secours--the French fire brigade) is in use, ensuring that firefighters are often the first on the spot, while the knowledge and skills of the dispatching physician are essential to ascertain the patient's needs, to preserve life and vital functions, and to ensure the patient is sent to the appropriate emergency healthcare facility. In life-threatening emergency situations, patients must be brought straight to the appropriate reference emergency healthcare facility, as quickly as possible, without prior admittance to an emergency department. This is the procedure for extremely acute emergency situations in the following areas: trauma (multiple trauma and/or uncontrolled bleeding, spinal cord trauma), delivery bleeding, other life-threatening situations such as ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrest (sudden death), cerebrovascular stroke and ensuing brain damage, some acute respiratory situations such as anaphylactic shock, foreign-body inhalation, electrocution, drowning, drug overdose, certain forms of poisoning, and conditions requiring initial hyperbaric oxygen (diving accidents, acute carbon monoxide and smoke poisoning). The reasons for suboptimal emergency care in life-threatening situations are currently a major issue, with medical facilities being reduced in some areas, fewer voluntary firemen, hospital reorganization, tight funding, difficulties of medical dispatching, and the varying skills of \"first-on-the-scene \"emergency workers. Grievances include late emergency responses, inappropriate medical care, and dispatching to the wrong facility. This raises the question of equal opportunity for all in a country with widely varying geographic features and population density. Improvement in the system's efficiency will require a series of objectives to be met in varied and complementary--Enhanced functional coordination, by speeding up the deployment of the ANTARES digital radio-frequency transmission network (Adaptation Nationale des Transmissions Aux Risques Et aux Secours).--Implementation of a network of emergency services with varying degrees of emergency healthcare management related to the technical nature of the facilities.

Life-threatening emergency situations are to be handled by level 2 or 3 facilities. Specific facilities must be selected as reference centers. In France, the ARS (Agences R\u00e9gionales de Sant\u00e9) is in charge of this procedure, as it provide funding for healthcare continuity--Reducing inequalities in access to emergency care. This will involve improving the network of SDIS brigades, making local medical facilities more responsive, delegating more medical procedures, on-site telemedicine, providing more helicopters equipped with healthcare facilities, more automated external defibrillators, and more dedicated neuro-vascular units.--First aid training must be made widely available.

The most significant barrier in tissue engineering is insufficient vascularization to deliver nutrients and metabolites during development in vitro and to facilitate rapid vascular integration in vivo. Tissue engineered constructs can be greatly improved by developing perfusable microvascular networks in vitro in order to provide transport that mimics native vascular organization and function. Here a microfluidic hydrogel is integrated with a self-assembling pro-vasculogenic co-culture in a strategy to perfuse microvascular networks in vitro. This approach allows for control over microvascular network self-assembly and employs an anastomotic interface for integration of self-assembled micro-vascular networks with fabricated microchannels. As a result, transport within the system shifts from simple diffusion to vessel supported convective transport and extra-vessel diffusion, thus improving overall mass transport properties.

Cardiac hemangiomas are extremely rare primary benign cardiac tumors that are often asymptomatic and are typically diagnosed incidentally during an echocardiographic examination. We report the case of a 27-year-old male who was referred to our hospital complaining of atypical chest pain over the last three months. The pain was unrelated to exercise, and consisted of 1-2 minutes of ongoing, stinging chest pain followed by 2-3 seconds of ongoing palpitations. His physical examination was unremarkable, his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, his ECG was sinus rhythm, and his heart rate was 82 beats/min. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a mobile 1.20x1.28 cm mass in the left ventricular cavity at the antero-lateral wall. Subsequent coronary angiography was performed to determine the vascular supply for the mass, and showed late opacification of a well-vascularized left ventricle mass from the second diagonal artery.

{"title": "A standardized rat model of volumetric muscle loss injury for the development of tissue engineering therapies.", "abstract": "Soft tissue injuries involving volumetric muscle loss (VML) are defined as the traumatic or surgical loss of skeletal muscle with resultant functional impairment and represent a challenging clinical problem for both military and civilian medicine. In response, a variety of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine treatments are under preclinical development. A wide variety of animal models are being used, all with critical limitations. The objective of this study was to develop a model of VML that was reproducible and technically uncomplicated to provide a standardized platform for the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine solutions to VML repair. A rat model of VML involving excision of \u223c20% of the muscle's mass from the superficial portion of the middle third of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was developed and was functionally characterized. The contralateral TA muscle served as the uninjured control. Additionally, uninjured age-matched control rats were also tested to determine the effect of VML on the contralateral limb. TA muscles were assessed at 2 and 4 months postinjury. VML muscles weighed 22.7% and 19.5% less than contralateral muscles at 2 and 4 months postinjury, respectively. These differences were accompanied by a reduction in peak isometric tetanic force (Po) of 28.4% and 32.5% at 2 and 4 months. Importantly, Po corrected for differences in body weight and muscle wet weights were similar between contralateral and age-matched control muscles, indicating that VML did not have a significant impact on the contralateral limb. Lastly, repair of the injury with a biological scaffold resulted in rapid vascularization and integration with the wound. The technical simplicity, reliability, and clinical relevance of the VML model developed in this study make it ideal as a standard model for the development of tissue engineering solutions for VML.", "journal": "BioResearch open access", "date": "2013-03-22", "authors": ["XiaowuWu", "Benjamin TCorona", "XiaoyuChen", "Thomas JWalters"], "doi": "10.1089/biores.2012.0271\n10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0290"}

The purpose of this study was to analyze a sample of patients who underwent FNAB of the thyroid and to compare the obtained data with the international guidelines and the recommendations for management of thyroid nodules.\nThis study analyzed the clinical, anamnestic and US reasons for which 97 nodules located in 89 patients underwent FNAB, and the data were compared with the criteria set by the guidelines and with the cytological results.\nEchogenicity was indication for FNAB in 99% of cases, appearance of the margins in 75.3%, presence of calcifications in 93.8% and presence of vascularity in 73.2%. In a total of 4.1% of cases, cytological outcome was positive for malignancy, 21.6% necessitated monitoring, 4.1% were referred to surgery and histological examination of the surgical specimen and 63.9% resulted negative for malignancy.\nThe finding of hypoechoic nodules often leads to continued investigation; the presence of intranodular vascularization detected at Doppler US is perceived as suspicious and the presence of microcalcifications always leads to further investigation. On the request of the endocrinologist the dominant nodule in a goiter is in most cases subjected to FNAB even if the volume has not increased. Adequate US criteria can help identify potentially malignant nodules and guide implementation of FNAB. However, identification of malignant nodules using instrumental investigation cannot disregard medical records and clinical laboratory tests. According to the authors' experience, a close collaboration between endocrinologists, radiologists and pathologists is essential for a correct evaluation of patients with thyroid nodules in order to avoid over or under estimation of the risk of malignancy of a nodule and therefore of the necessity to perform further examinations.\nSommario INTRODUZIONE: Data l\u2019elevata prevalenza di noduli tiroidei nella popolazione generale \u00e8 indispensabile un metodo di individuazione dei noduli sospetti per neoplasia da sottoporre an FNAB per evitare un sovra o sotto trattamento della patologia. I criteri ecografici individuati da Dizionario - Visualizza dizionario dettaglKim et\u00a0al e dall\u2019American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists risultano essere rispettivamente i pi\u00f9 sensibili e pi\u00f9 specifici. Lo scopo dello studio \u00e8 di analizzare un campione di pazienti sottoposti a biopsia tiroidea con ago sottile (Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy - FNAB) e verificare quanto nella pratica clinica si faccia riferimento alle linee guida. MATERIALI E METODI: Sono state analizzate le motivazioni clinico-anamnestiche e/o ecografiche per cui 97 (in 89 pazienti) noduli sono stati sottoposti FNAB; i dati sono stati confrontati con i criteri indicati dalle linee guida ed con i risultati citologici. RISULTATI: L\u2019ecogenicit\u00e0 era indicata nel 99% dei casi, l\u2019aspetto dei margini nel 75.3%, la presenza di calcificazioni nel 93.8%, la presenza di vascolarizzazione nel 73.2%. Il 4.1% dei noduli punti \u00e8 risultato positivo per neoplasia, il 21.6% da monitorare, il 4.1% da sottoporre ad esame istologico (su pezzo chirurgico) ed il 63.9% negativo. DISCUSSIONE: Il nodulo ipoecogeno induce spesso alla prosecuzione degli accertamenti; la presenza di vascolarizzazione al Doppler viene percepita come sospetta; la presenza di microcalcificazioni d\u00e0 sempre seguito ad accertamenti ulteriori. Il nodulo prevalente in uno struma viene sottoposto an FNAB anche in molti casi in cui non ha subito crescita, in base a specifica richiesta endocrinologica. I criteri ecografici consentono di identificare i noduli potenzialmente maligni e di orientare l\u2019esecuzione di FNAB; l\u2019identificazione di noduli maligni con esami strumentali non pu\u00f2 prescindere dai dati anamnestici e clinico-laboratoristici. Quindi, anche in base alla nostra esperienza, \u00e8 fondamentale la collaborazione tra endocrinologi, radiologi ed anatomo-patologi per una corretta valutazione del paziente con noduli tiroidei al fine di evitare sovra o sottostima del rischio di malignit\u00e0 di un nodulo e dunque della necessit\u00e0 o meno di eseguire esami di approfondimento.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound", "date": "2013-02-12", "authors": ["MPeli", "ECapalbo", "MLovisatti", "MCosentino", "EBerti", "RMattai Dal Moro", "MCariati"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jus.2011.12.004"}

{"title": "Riparian ecosystems in human cancers.", "abstract": "Intratumoral evolution produces extensive genetic heterogeneity in clinical cancers. This is generally attributed to an increased mutation rate that continually produces new genetically defined clonal lineages. Equally important are the interactions between the heritable traits of cancer cells and their microenvironment that produces natural selection favoring some clonal 'species' over others. That is, while mutations produce the heritable variation, environmental selection and cellular adaptation govern the strategies (and genotypes) that can proliferate within the tumor ecosystem. Here we ask: What are the dominant evolutionary forces in the cancer ecosystem? We propose that the tumor vascular network is a common and primary cause of intratumoral heterogeneity. Specifically, variations in blood flow result in variability in substrate, such as oxygen, and metabolites, such as acid, that serve as critical, but predictable, environmental selection forces. We examine the evolutionary and ecological consequences of variable blood flow by drawing an analogy to riparian habitats within desert landscapes. We propose that the phenotypic properties of cancer cells will exhibit predictable spatial variation within tumor phenotypes as a result of proximity to blood flow. Just as rivers in the desert create an abrupt shift from the lush, mesic riparian vegetation along the banks to sparser, xeric and dry-adapted plant species in the adjacent drylands, we expect blood vessels within tumors to promote similarly distinct communities of cancer cells that change abruptly with distance from the blood vessel. We propose vascular density and blood flow within a tumor as a primary evolutionary force governing variations in the phenotypic properties of cancer cells thus providing a unifying ecological framework for understanding intratumoral heterogeneity.", "journal": "Evolutionary applications", "date": "2013-02-12", "authors": ["Khalid OAlfarouk", "Muntaser EIbrahim", "Robert AGatenby", "Joel SBrown"], "doi": "10.1111/eva.12015"}
{"title": "Prospectives for gene therapy of retinal degenerations.", "abstract": "Retinal degenerations encompass a large number of diseases in which the retina and associated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells progressively degenerate leading to severe visual disorders or blindness. Retinal degenerations can be divided into two groups, a group in which the defect has been linked to a specific gene and a second group that has a complex etiology that includes environmental and genetic influences. The first group encompasses a number of relatively rare diseases with the most prevalent being Retinitis pigmentosa that affects approximately 1 million individuals worldwide. Attempts have been made to correct the defective gene by transfecting the appropriate cells with the wild-type gene and while these attempts have been successful in animal models, human gene therapy for these inherited retinal degenerations has only begun recently and the results are promising. To the second group belong glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). These retinal degenerations have a genetic component since they occur more often in families with affected probands but they are also linked to environmental factors, specifically elevated intraocular pressure, age and high blood sugar levels respectively. The economic and medical impact of these three diseases can be assessed by the number of individuals affected; AMD affects over 30 million, DR over 40 million and glaucoma over 65 million individuals worldwide. The basic defect in these diseases appears to be the relative lack of a neurogenic environment; the neovascularization that often accompanies these diseases has suggested that a decrease in pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), at least in part, may be responsible for the neurodegeneration since PEDF is not only an effective neurogenic and neuroprotective agent but also a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. In the last few years inhibitors of vascularization, especially antibodies against vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGF), have been used to prevent the neovascularization that accompanies AMD and DR resulting in the amelioration of vision in a significant number of patients. In animal models it has been shown that transfection of RPE cells with the gene for PEDF and other growth factors can prevent or slow degeneration. A limited number of studies in humans have also shown that transfection of RPE cells in vivo with the gene for PEDF is effective in preventing degeneration and restore vision. Most of these studies have used virally mediated gene delivery with all its accompanying side effects and have not been widely used. New techniques using non-viral protocols that allow efficient delivery and permanent integration of the transgene into the host cell genome offer novel opportunities for effective treatment of retinal degenerations.", "journal": "Current genomics", "date": "2013-02-02", "authors": ["GabrieleThumann"], "doi": "10.2174/138920212801619214"}
{"title": "Dose-dependent Effect of Statin Therapy on Circulating CXCL12 Levels in Patients with Hyperlipidemia.", "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have pleiotropic effects that are independent of cholesterol-lowering, including a dose-dependent effect on angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a critical role both in vascularization of the chronically ischemic myocardium and in stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. Chemokines, a family of structurally-related cytokine molecules, exert diverse biological functions including control of angiogenesis. The effect of statin therapy on angiogenic and angiostatic chemokines has not been evaluated extensively. We sought to test the hypothesis that, in subjects with hyperlipidemia, statin therapy influences plasma levels of angiogenic and angiostatic chemokines in a dose-dependent manner.\nWe prospectively collected demographic, angiographic and laboratory data from subjects with a history of hyperlipidemia who were either untreated or on statin therapy. A peripheral blood sample was obtained for measurement of plasma angiogenic and angiostatic chemokines. Multivariable analysis using logistic regression was performed adjusting for the following variables: age, gender, prior myocardial infarction, and chronic administration of aspirin, clopidogrel, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.\n168 patients on statin therapy (48 on low-dose, defined as <10mg atorvastatin-equivalent, and 120 on high-dose, defined as \u226510mg atorvastatin-equivalent dose) and 11 subjects from the same database who had a history of hyperlipidemia but who were not on statins were enrolled. There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, co-morbidities, lipid panels, other medications, or angiographic data between the groups. The angiogenic chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL12 levels were significantly different across the groups. Median levels of CXCL1 were highest in subjects not on statin therapy. Compared to subjects either not on statin therapy or on low-dose statins, those taking high-dose statins had lower median values of CXCL12 (2316 [2255-11071], vs 2362 [2016-10622], vs 2189 [1968-2705] pg/mL, p=0.042). On multivariate analysis, CXCL12 remained the only factor that was strongly and inversely associated with statin dose at the 95% level (p=0.011).\nCompared to no therapy or low-dose statin therapy, treatment with high-doses of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with decreased circulating CXCL12 levels in subjects with hyperlipidemia, and CXCL12 is strongly and inversely associated with statin dose. Additional studies are needed to confirm this finding in other cohorts and to determine if high-dose statins affect angiogenesis in patients.", "journal": "Clinical and translational medicine", "date": "2013-02-02", "authors": ["WillCamnitz", "Marie DBurdick", "Robert MStrieter", "BornaMehrad", "Ellen CKeeley"], "doi": "10.1186/2001-1326-1-23\n10.1161/hc0602.103393\n10.1161/01.RES.0000014081.30867.F8\n10.1097/00041433-200312000-00008\n10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00965-X\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.11.013\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00263-8\n10.1189/jlb.0909602\n10.1093/cvr/cvn244\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0785\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.162305"}

{"title": "Bone circulatory disturbances in the development of spontaneous bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis: a translational model for the pathogenesis of femoral head necrosis.", "abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the vascularization of the avian growth plate and its subsequent role in the pathogenesis of bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO, femoral head necrosis). BCO sporadically causes high incidences of lameness in rapidly growing broiler (meat-type) chickens. BCO is believed to be initiated by micro-trauma to poorly mineralized columns of cartilage cells in the proximal growth plates of the leg bones, followed by colonization by hematogenously distributed opportunistic bacteria. Inadequate blood flow to the growth plate, vascular occlusion, and structural limitations of the microvasculature all have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BCO. Treatment strategies have been difficult to investigate because under normal conditions the incidence of BCO typically is low and sporadic. Rearing broilers on wire flooring triggers the spontaneous development of high incidences of lameness attributable to pathognomonic BCO lesions. Wire flooring imposes persistent footing instability and is thought to accelerate the development of BCO by amplifying the torque and shear stress imposed on susceptible leg joints. Wire flooring per se also constitutes a significant chronic stressor that promotes bacterial proliferation attributed to stress-mediated immunosuppression. Indeed, dexamethasone-mediated immunosuppression causes broilers to develop lameness primarily associated with avascular necrosis and BCO. Prophylactic probiotic administration consistently reduces the incidence of lameness in broilers reared on wire flooring, presumably by reducing bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract that likely contributes to hematogenous infection of the leg bones. The pathogenesis of BCO in broilers is directly relevant to osteomyelitis in growing children, as well as to avascular femoral head necrosis in adults. Our new model for reliably triggering spontaneous osteomyelitis in large numbers of animals represents an important opportunity to conduct translational research focused on developing effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments.", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "date": "2013-01-25", "authors": ["Robert FWideman", "Rhonda DPrisby"], "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2012.00183\n10.2307/1591650\n10.1084/jem.107.6.821\n10.3382/ps.0701936\n10.1354/vp.40-4-345\n10.1002/aja.1001140310\n10.3382/ps.0680873\n10.1097/00003086-199711000-00003\n10.1080/00071660902942783\n10.1016/0021-9975(85)90022-2\n10.1080/00071668.2012.675429\n10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00308-2\n10.1002/path.1711420203\n10.1016/0304-4165(96)00026-8\n10.1016/8756-3282(92)90249-V\n10.1002/jbmr.5650080908\n10.2307/1590672\n10.1111/j.1751-0813.1984.tb06015.x\n10.1002/ar.1091940110\n10.1159/000145345\n10.1354/vp.42-3-275\n10.2307/1590680\n10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.04.015\n10.1080/03079457.2011.619165\n10.1080/03079458308436164\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1989.tb02498.x\n10.3382/ps.0730883\n10.1080/00071669208417536\n10.1080/00071669889349\n10.3382/ps.0730897\n10.2307/1590156\n10.2307/1590156\n10.1016/S0378-1135(98)00240-5\n10.2307/1590379\n10.2307/1590379\n10.2307/1589148\n10.1111/j.1751-0813.1972.tb09237.x\n10.1292/jvms1939.25.93\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.10.1647\n10.1016/S0034-5288(96)90014-4\n10.3382/ps.0701806\n10.2307/1589073\n10.2307/1590185\n10.1083/jcb.131.2.483\n10.1016/S0378-1135(99)00112-1\n10.1002/path.1700670110\n10.1177/104063871002200426\n10.2307/1592052\n10.1080/03079459408418991\n10.1080/03079459308418924\n10.1016/S0034-5288(97)90183-1\n10.1016/0034-5288(91)90030-R\n10.1093/cid/ciq198\n10.3382/ps.2012-02386\n10.3382/ps.2012-02386\n10.1053/rvsc.2000.0392\n10.1080/00071667008415822\n10.1080/00071667008415822\n10.3382/ps.2012-02244\n10.1080/713655061\n10.1002/art.1780401119\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.03.006\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.011\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.08.016"}
{"title": "A computationally efficient framework for the simulation of cardiac perfusion using a multi-compartment Darcy porous-media flow model.", "abstract": "We present a method to efficiently simulate coronary perfusion in subject-specific models of the heart within clinically relevant time frames. Perfusion is modelled as a Darcy porous-media flow, where the permeability tensor is derived from homogenization of an explicit anatomical representation of the vasculature. To account for the disparity in length scales present in the vascular network, in this study, this approach is further refined through the implementation of a multi-compartment medium where each compartment encapsulates the spatial scales in a certain range by using an effective permeability tensor. Neighbouring compartments then communicate through distributed sources and sinks, acting as volume fluxes. Although elegant from a modelling perspective, the full multi-compartment Darcy system is computationally expensive to solve. We therefore enhance computational efficiency of this model by reducing the N-compartment system of Darcy equations to N pressure equations, and N subsequent projection problems to recover the Darcy velocity. The resulting 'reduced' Darcy formulation leads to a dramatic reduction in algebraic-system size and is therefore computationally cheaper to solve than the full multi-compartment Darcy system. A comparison of the reduced and the full formulation in terms of solution time and memory usage clearly highlights the superior performance of the reduced formulation. Moreover, the implementation of flux and, specifically, impermeable boundary conditions on arbitrarily curved boundaries such as epicardium and endocardium is straightforward in contrast to the full Darcy formulation.

{"title": "Bone tissue engineering: recent advances and challenges.", "abstract": "The worldwide incidence of bone disorders and conditions has trended steeply upward and is expected to double by 2020, especially in populations where aging is coupled with increased obesity and poor physical activity. Engineered bone tissue has been viewed as a potential alternative to the conventional use of bone grafts, due to their limitless supply and no disease transmission. However, bone tissue engineering practices have not proceeded to clinical practice due to several limitations or challenges. Bone tissue engineering aims to induce new functional bone regeneration via the synergistic combination of biomaterials, cells, and factor therapy. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals of bone tissue engineering, highlighting the current state of this field. Further, we review the recent advances of biomaterial and cell-based research, as well as approaches used to enhance bone regeneration. Specifically, we discuss widely investigated biomaterial scaffolds, micro- and nano-structural properties of these scaffolds, and the incorporation of biomimetic properties and/or growth factors. In addition, we examine various cellular approaches, including the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and their clinical application strengths and limitations. We conclude by overviewing the challenges that face the bone tissue engineering field, such as the lack of sufficient vascularization at the defect site, and the research aimed at functional bone tissue engineering. These challenges will drive future research in the field.", "journal": "Critical reviews in biomedical engineering", "date": "2013-01-24", "authors": ["Ami RAmini", "Cato TLaurencin", "Syam PNukavarapu"], "doi": "10.1615/critrevbiomedeng.v40.i5.10"}

PTT observation quality was improved compared to using a submalleolar portal. Dissection confirmed systematic presence of a vincula on the posterior side of the tendon, connected to the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon, containing collateral vessels of the posterior tibial artery.

The main attention was given to the remodeling of the villous epithelium and capillary network. The significant reduction of the epithelial area and that of the villous stroma was detected simultaneously with intensive their vascularization.

This study prospectively evaluated 15 patients (19 hips) who presented with an average age of 28.5 (range, 12 to 46) years and stages 2 (6/19), 3 (2/19), 4 (9/19), and 5 (2/19) of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. All patients were treated with free vascularized fibular autografting (FVFG) to the femoral head. Postoperative evaluations of pain symptoms and functional activity showed improvements in all patients. The average follow-up time was 8 years. Harris hip scores significantly increased from an average preoperative score of 75.3 to an average postoperative score of 94.8. Seventy-five percent of patients were able to return to their sport after recovery and all patients reported being satisfied with the procedure and would repeat their decision to have surgery. Three patients' hips were converted to arthroplasty at 3, 11, and 17 years post-FVFG.

{"title": "Mapping Tumor Hypoxia In Vivo Using Pattern Recognition of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI Data.", "abstract": "In solid tumors, hypoxia contributes significantly to radiation and chemotherapy resistance and to poor outcomes. The \"gold standard\" pO(2) electrode measurements of hypoxia in vivo are unsatisfactory because they are invasive and have limited spatial coverage. Here, we present an approach to identify areas of tumor hypoxia using the signal versus time curves of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data as a surrogate marker of hypoxia. We apply an unsupervised pattern recognition (PR) technique to determine the differential signal versus time curves associated with different tumor microenvironmental characteristics in DCE-MRI data of a preclinical cancer model. Well-perfused tumor areas are identified by rapid contrast uptake followed by rapid washout; hypoxic areas, which are regions of reduced vascularization, are identified by delayed contrast signal buildup and washout; and necrotic areas exhibit slow or no contrast uptake and no discernible washout over the experimental observation. The strength of the PR concept is that it captures the pixel-enhancing behavior in its entirety-during both contrast agent uptake and washout-and thus, subtleties in the temporal behavior of contrast enhancement related to features of the tumor microenvironment (driven by vascular changes) may be detected. The assignment of the tumor compartments/microenvironment to well vascularized, hypoxic, and necrotic is validated by comparison to data previously obtained using complementary imaging modalities. The proposed novel analysis approach has the advantage that it can be readily translated to the clinic, as DCE-MRI is used routinely for the identification of tumors in patients, is widely available, and easily implemented on any clinical magnet.", "journal": "Translational oncology", "date": "2013-01-18", "authors": ["RadkaStoyanova", "KrisHuang", "KiriSandler", "HyungjoonCho", "SeanCarlin", "Pat BZanzonico", "Jason AKoutcher", "EllenAckerstaff"], "doi": "10.1593/tlo.12319"}

The natural history of the disease is extremely unfavorable and once a fracture occurs, there is a little or no tendency for the lesion to heal spontaneously. It is challenging to treat effectively this difficult condition and its possible complications. Treatment is mainly surgical and it aims to obtain a long term bone union, to prevent limb length discrepancies, to avoid mechanical axis deviation, soft tissue lesions, nearby joint stiffness, and pathological fracture. The key to get primary union is to excise hamartomatous tissue and pathological periosteum. Age at surgery, status of fibula, associated shortening, and deformities of leg and ankle play significant role in primary union and residual challenges after primary healing. Unfortunately, none of invasive and noninvasive methods have proven their superiority. Surgical options such as intramedullary nailing, vascularized fibula graft, and external fixator, have shown equivocal success rate in achieving primary union although they are often associated with acceptable results. Amputation must be reserved for failed reconstruction, severe limb length discrepancy and gross deformities of leg and ankle.

Computer image analysis was performed to measure integrated optimal density of CCN2 mRNA-positive cells in carcinoma foci and the surrounding stroma. Fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1) and E-cadherin were examined to evaluate the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and FSP-1 were detected to identify hepatic stellate cells, and CD34 was measured to evaluate the extent of vascularization in liver tissues by immunohistochemical staining. CCN2 was assessed for its stimulation of HepG2 cell migration and invasion using commercial kits while flow cytometry was used to determine CCN2 effects on HepG2 cell-cycle.\nIn situ hybridization analysis showed that TGF-\u03b21 mRNA was mainly detected in connective tissues and vasculature around carcinoma foci.

Various surgical techniques, such as gastric and colonic interposition, are standards of treatment, but frequently complicated by stenosis and other problems. Regenerative medicine approaches facilitate the use of biological constructs to replace or regenerate normal tissue function. We review the literature of esophageal tissue engineering, discuss its implications, compare the methodologies that have been employed and suggest possible directions for the future. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, National Research Register and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched with the following search terms: stem cell and esophagus, esophageal replacement, esophageal tissue engineering, esophageal substitution. Reference lists of papers identified were also examined and experts in this field contacted for further information. All full-text articles in English of all potentially relevant abstracts were reviewed. Tissue engineering has involved acellular scaffolds that were either transplanted with the aim of being repopulated by host cells or seeded prior to transplantation. When acellular scaffolds were used to replace patch and short tubular defects they allowed epithelial and partial muscular migration whereas when employed for long tubular defects the results were poor leading to an increased rate of stenosis and mortality. Stenting has been shown as an effective means to reduce stenotic changes and promote cell migration, whilst omental wrapping to induce vascularization of the construct has an uncertain benefit. Decellularized matrices have been recently suggested as the optimal choice for scaffolds, but smart polymers that will incorporate signalling to promote cell-scaffold interaction may provide a more reproducible and available solution. Results in animal models that have used seeded scaffolds strongly suggest that seeding of both muscle and epithelial cells on scaffolds prior to implantation is a prerequisite for complete esophageal replacement.

{"title": "Restoring physiological cell heterogeneity in the mesenchyme during tooth engineering.", "abstract": "Tooth development is controlled by reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Complete teeth can form when culturing and implanting re-associations between single embryonic dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Although epithelial histogenesis is clear, very little is known about cell diversity and patterning in the mesenchyme. The aim of this work was to compare the situation in engineered and developing teeth at similar developmental stages. To this end, the expression of cell surface markers in the mesenchyme was investigated by immunostaining in: 1) embryonic mouse molars at embryonic day 14, as the initial cell source for re-associations, 2) cultured cell re-associations just before their implantation and 3) cultured cell re-associations implanted for two weeks. Surface markers allowed visualization of the complex patterning of different cell types and the differential timing in their appearance. The phenotype of mesenchymal cells rapidly changed when they were grown as a monolayer, even without passage. This might explain the rapid loss of their potential to sustain tooth formation after re-association. Except for markers associated with vascularization, which is not maintained in vitro, the staining pattern in the mesenchyme of cultured re-associations was similar to that observed in situ. After implantation, vascularization and the cellular heterogeneity in the mesenchyme were similar to what was observed in developing molars. Besides tissue oxygenation and its role in mineralization of dental matrices, vascularization is involved in the progressive increase in mesenchymal cell heterogeneity, by allowing external cells to enter the mesenchyme.", "journal": "The International journal of developmental biology", "date": "2013-01-16", "authors": ["Laetitia-V\u00e9roniqueKeller", "SabineKuchler-Bopp", "Herv\u00e9Lesot"], "doi": "10.1387/ijdb.120076hl"}

Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT) frequently alters thyroid vascularization, likely as a result of the autoimmune process. Objective. To evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the thyroid vascularization of patients with hypothyroidism induced by CAT using color Doppler ultrasound parameters. Methods. In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients who underwent levothyroxine replacement for CAT-induced hypothyroidism were randomly assigned to receive either 10 sessions of LLLT (L group, n = 23) or 10 sessions of a placebo treatment (P group, n = 20). Color Doppler ultrasounds were performed before and 30 days after interventions. To verify the vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma, power Doppler was performed. The systolic peak velocity (SPV) and resistance index (RI) in the superior (STA) and inferior thyroid arteries (ITAs) were measured by pulsed Doppler. Results. The frequency of normal vascularization of the thyroid lobes observed in the postintervention power Doppler examination was significantly higher in the L than in the P group (P = 0.023). The pulsed Doppler examination revealed an increase in the SPV of the ITA in the L group compared with the P group (P = 0.016).

Our results showed that the proliferation and attachment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were substantially improved by P(PEGMA)-REDV conjugation compared to pristine Ti surfaces, whilst no significant effects were observed for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), thus confirming the selectivity of REDV for ECs.

We used CD31 to label the endothelial cells in order to evaluate the response of the vascular network to VEGF synthesis. Our results showed an increase of VEGF protein synthesis in obese and obese-diabetic patients compared to lean subjects where the protein was absent. The positivity for VEGF in obese diabetic samples was observed in numerous structures from the adipose depots, both in the stromal vascular fraction--blood vessels and stromal cells--as well as in the cytoplasm of adipocytes. Positivity in the vascular wall was observed more frequently in areas of perivascular and intralobular fibrosis. Obese and diabetic patients showed similar incidence of CD31 immunoreactivity with lean subjects in both subcutaneous and peritoneal depots. In conclusion, human adipose depots show a different incidence of VEGF positive cells in relation with their disposal and the metabolic status.

The mRNA and protein levels of VEGF 165 and VEGF 165 protein amount in supernatant were significantly higher in VEGF plasmid group than in the other two groups, with P values all below 0.05. (2) The number of HUVECs in dermal substitutes of transfected cells group was significantly higher than that of the other three groups on POD 14. The numbers of microvessels of dermal substitutes on POD 14 in saline group, medium group, non-transfected cells group, transfected cells group were respectively 4.2 \u00b1 1.1, 5.2 \u00b1 1.1, 6.6 \u00b1 0.9, 13.8 \u00b1 0.8 per 200 times visual field (F = 17.96, P < 0.01).

While surgery remains the option that offers the foremost success rate against such pathologies, several limitations still hinder its widespread development. Among the limiting factors is the lack of accurate planning systems, which has been a motivation for several recent works, aiming at better resection planning and training systems, relying on pre-operative imaging, anatomical and biomechanical modelling. While the vascular network in the liver plays a key role in defining the operative strategy, its influence at a biomechanical level has not been taken into account. In the paper we propose a real-time model of vascularized organs such as the liver. The model takes into account separate constitutive laws for the parenchyma and vessels, and defines a coupling mechanism between these two entities. In the evaluation section, we present results of in vitro porcine liver experiments that indicate a significant influence of vascular structures on the mechanical behaviour of tissue. We confirm the values obtained in the experiments by computer simulation using standard FEM. Finally, we show that the conventional modelling approach can be efficiently approximated with the proposed composite model capable of real-time calculations.", "journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

While these drugs offer hope for cancer patients, their transient effect on tumor vasculature is difficult to assess in clinical settings. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel endoscopic imaging technology that enables histological examination of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using CLE to image the vascular network in fresh biopsies of human colorectal tissue. For this purpose we have imaged normal and malignant biopsy tissue samples and compared the vascular network parameters obtained with CLE with established histopathology techniques.\nFresh non-fixed biopsy samples of both normal and malignant colorectal mucosa were stained with fluorescently labeled anti-CD31 antibodies and imaged by CLE using a dedicated endomicroscopy system. Corresponding biopsy samples underwent immunohistochemical staining for CD31, assessing the microvessel density (MVD) and vascular areas for comparison with CLE data, which were measured offline using specific software.\nThe vessels were imaged by CLE in both normal and tumor samples. The average diameter of normal vessels was 8.5\u00b10.9 \u00b5m whereas in tumor samples it was 13.5\u00b10.7 \u00b5m (p\u200a=\u200a0.0049). Vascular density was 188.7\u00b124.9 vessels/mm(2) in the normal tissue vs. 242.4\u00b116.1 vessels/mm(2) in the colorectal cancer samples (p\u200a=\u200a0.1201). In the immunohistochemistry samples, the MVD was 211.2\u00b142.9/mm(2) and 351.3\u00b139.6/mm(2) for normal and malignant mucosa, respectively. The vascular area was 2.9\u00b10.5% of total tissue area for the normal mucosa and 8.5\u00b12.1% for primary colorectal cancer tissue.\nSelective imaging of blood vessels with CLE is feasible in normal and tumor colorectal tissue by using fluorescently labeled antibodies targeted against an endothelial marker.

Current arthrodesis procedures use bone grafts from autogenous bone, allogenic backed bone or synthetic materials. Autogenous bone grafts can result in donor site morbidity and pain at the donor site, while allogenic backed bone and synthetic materials have variable effectiveness. Given these limitations, researchers have focused on new treatments that will allow for safe and successful bone repair and regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received attention for their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, cells that synthesize the extracellular matrix and regulate matrix mineralization. Successful bone regeneration requires three elements: MSCs that serve as osteoblastic progenitors, osteoinductive growth factors and their pathways that promote development and differentiation of the cells as well as an osteoconductive scaffold that allows for the formation of a vascular network. Future treatments should strive to combine mesenchymal stem cells, cell-seeded scaffolds and gene therapy to optimize the efficiency and safety of tissue repair and bone regeneration.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2013-01-03", "authors": ["JoshNeman", "AmandaHambrecht", "CherieCadry", "AmirGoodarzi", "JonathanYoussefzadeh", "Mike YChen", "RahulJandial"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-4090-1_11"}

Previous work has suggested the importance of a sufficiently large transmural pressure in maintaining vascular stability and perfusion. Here we show that a system of empty channels that provides a drainage function analogous to that of lymphatic microvasculature in vivo can stabilize vascular adhesion and maintain perfusion rate in dense, hydraulically resistive fibrin scaffolds in vitro. In the absence of drainage, endothelial delamination increased as scaffold density increased from 6 to 30 mg/mL and scaffold hydraulic conductivity decreased by a factor of 20. Single drainage channels exerted only localized vascular stabilization, the extent of which depended on the distance between vessel and drainage as well as scaffold density. Computational modeling of these experiments yielded an estimate of 0.40-1.36 cm H2O for the minimum transmural pressure required for vascular stability. We further designed and constructed fibrin patches (0.8 \u00d7 0.9 cm(2)) that were perfused by a parallel array of vessels and drained by an orthogonal array of drainage channels; only with the drainage did the vessels display long-term stability and perfusion.

Numerous studies focus on the deleterious effects of alcohol on neural cells. Although recent studies suggest that alcohol can affect angiogenesis in adults, the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain microvasculature remains poorly understood.\nWe used a mouse model to investigate effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in vivo and ex vivo and the action of alcohol, glutamate, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) on activity, plasticity, and survival of microvessels. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, calcimetry, and videomicroscopy. We characterized the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in human controls and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (pFAS) patients at different developmental stages.\nIn mice, prenatal alcohol exposure induced a reduction of cortical vascular density, loss of the radial orientation of microvessels, and altered expression of VEGF receptors. Time-lapse experiments performed on brain slices revealed that ethanol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells, affected plasticity, and promoted death of microvessels. These effects were prevented by VEGF. In humans, we evidenced a stage-dependent alteration of the vascular network in the cortices of fetuses with pFAS/FAS. Whereas no modification was observed from gestational week 20 (WG20) to WG22, the radial organization of cortical microvessels was clearly altered in pFAS/FAS patients from WG30 to WG38.\nPrenatal alcohol exposure affects cortical angiogenesis both in mice and in pFAS/FAS patients, suggesting that vascular defects contribute to alcohol-induced brain abnormalities.", "journal": "Annals of neurology", "date": "2013-01-03", "authors": ["SylvieJ\u00e9gou", "FaizaEl Ghazi", "Pamela Kwetieude Lendeu", "St\u00e9phaneMarret", "VincentLaudenbach", "ArnaudUguen", "PascaleMarcorelles", "VincentRoy", "AnnieLaquerri\u00e8re", "Bruno Jos\u00e9Gonzalez"], "doi": "10.1002/ana.23699"}

{"title": "Disruption of thrombospondin-2 accelerates ischemic fracture healing.", "abstract": "Thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) is a matricellular protein that is highly up-regulated during fracture healing. TSP2 negatively regulates vascularity, vascular reperfusion following ischemia, and cutaneous wound healing. As well, TSP2-null mice show increased endocortical bone formation due to an enhanced number of mesenchymal progenitor cells and show increased cortical thickness. Mice deficient in TSP2 (TSP2-null) show an alteration in fracture healing, that is unrelated to their cortical bone phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced vascularization with a shift towards an intramembranous healing phenotype; thus, we hypothesized that there would be enhanced ischemic fracture healing in the absence of TSP2. We investigated whether an absence of TSP2 would enhance ischemic fracture healing utilizing Laser doppler, \u00b5CT and histological analysis. Ischemic tibial fractures were created in wildtype (WT) and TSP2-null mice and harvested 10, 20, or 40 days post-fracture. TSP2-null mice show enhanced vascular perfusion following ischemic fracture. At day 10 post-fracture, TSP2-null mice have 115% greater bone volume than WT mice. This is associated with a 122% increase in vessel density, 20% increase in cell proliferation, and 15% decrease in apoptosis compared to WT. At day 20, TSP2-null mice have 34% more bone volume, 51% greater bone volume fraction, and 37% more bone tissue mineral density than WT. By 40 days after fracture the TSP2-null mice have a 24% increase in bone volume fraction, but other parameters show no significant differences.

We further demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation sites within ShcA (Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) and Tyr(313)) transduce distinct and non-redundant signals that promote these TGF\u03b2-mediated effects. We demonstrate that Grb2 is required specifically downstream of Tyr(313), whereas the Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) phosphorylation sites require the Crk adaptor proteins to augment TGF\u03b2-induced migration and invasion. Furthermore, ShcA Tyr(313) phosphorylation enhances tumor cell survival, and ShcA Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) signaling promotes endothelial cell recruitment into ErbB2-expressing breast tumors in vivo, whereas all three ShcA tyrosine residues are required for efficient breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Our data uncover a novel ShcA-dependent signaling axis downstream of TGF\u03b2 and ErbB2 that requires both the Grb2 and Crk adaptor proteins to increase the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cells.

{"title": "Manual drainage of the zebrafish embryonic brain ventricles.", "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a protein rich fluid contained within the brain ventricles. It is present during early vertebrate embryonic development and persists throughout life. Adult CSF is thought to cushion the brain, remove waste, and carry secreted molecules(1,2). In the adult and older embryo, the majority of CSF is made by the choroid plexus, a series of highly vascularized secretory regions located adjacent to the brain ventricles(3-5). In zebrafish, the choroid plexus is fully formed at 144 hours post fertilization (hpf)(6). Prior to this, in both zebrafish and other vertebrate embryos including mouse, a significant amount of embryonic CSF (eCSF) is present . These data and studies in chick suggest that the neuroepithelium is secretory early in development and may be the major source of eCSF prior to choroid plexus development(7). eCSF contains about three times more protein than adult CSF, suggesting that it may have an important role during development(8,9). Studies in chick and mouse demonstrate that secreted factors in the eCSF, fluid pressure, or a combination of these, are important for neurogenesis, gene expression, cell proliferation, and cell survival in the neuroepithelium(10-20). Proteomic analyses of human, rat, mouse, and chick eCSF have identified many proteins that may be necessary for CSF function. These include extracellular matrix components, apolipoproteins, osmotic pressure regulating proteins, and proteins involved in cell death and proliferation(21-24). However, the complex functions of the eCSF are largely unknown. We have developed a method for removing eCSF from zebrafish brain ventricles, thus allowing for identification of eCSF components and for analysis of the eCSF requirement during development. Although more eCSF can be collected from other vertebrate systems with larger embryos, eCSF can be collected from the earliest stages of zebrafish development, and under genetic or environmental conditions that lead to abnormal brain ventricle volume or morphology. Removal and collection of eCSF allows for mass spectrometric analysis, investigation of eCSF function, and reintroduction of select factors into the ventricles to assay their function. Thus the accessibility of the early zebrafish embryo allows for detailed analysis of eCSF function during development.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-12-29", "authors": ["Jessica TChang", "HazelSive"], "doi": "10.3791/4243"}

{"title": "Fascia redefined: anatomical features and technical relevance in fascial flap surgery.", "abstract": "Fascia has traditionally been thought of as a passive structure that envelops muscles, and the term \"fascia\" was misused and confusing. However, it is now evident that fascia is a dynamic tissue with complex vasculature and innervation. A definition of fascia as an integral tissue has been provided here, highlighting the main features of the superficial and deep fasciae. Wide anatomic variations and site-specific differences in fascial structure are described, coupled with results of our extensive investigations of fascial anatomy. This will enable surgeons to make better decisions on selecting the appropriate fascia in the construction of fascial flaps. The use of the superficial or deep fasciae in the creation of a fascial flap cannot be selected at random, but must be guided by the anatomical features of the different types of fasciae. In particular, we suggest the use of the superficial fascia, such as the parascapular fascio-cutaneous free flap or any cutaneous flap, when a well-vascularized elastic flap, with the capacity to adhere to underlying tissues, is required, and a fascio-cutaneous flap formed by aponeurotic fascia to resurface any tendon or joints exposures. Moreover, the aponeurotic fascia, such as the fascia lata, can be used as a surgical patch if the plastic surgeon requires strong resistance to stress and/or the capacity to glide freely. Finally, the epimysial fascia, such as in the latissimus dorsi flap, can be used with success when used together with the underlying muscles. Clearly, extensive clinical experience and judgment are necessary for assessment of their potential use.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2012-12-26", "authors": ["CarlaStecco", "CesareTiengo", "AntonioStecco", "AndreaPorzionato", "VeronicaMacchi", "RobertStern", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-012-1058-0"}

The scaling method was used on a visuo-motor paradigm and resulted in a consistent increase in t-values in all task-activated cortical regions, with increases in peak t-values of 37.0% in the visual cortex and 12.7% in the left motor cortex.

Its occurrence has increased drastically over the last few years due to assisted reproduction procedures. In general, the diagnosis is made during the first trimester by using endovaginal two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS), through observing a complex para- or retrouterine mass in association with a viable uterine pregnancy. However, under some conditions such as atypical ultrasonographic presentations, 2DUS does not clarify the situation whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis is able to do so. We present the case of a pregnant woman in her fifth pregnancy, with a clinical condition of lower abdominal pain and pallor. Endovaginal 2DUS showed a complex voluminous mass in the left pelvic region in association with a viable intrauterine pregnancy. 2DUS in power Doppler mode showed \"ring\" vascularization, compatible with an ectopic gestational sac. MRI was of great importance in that it suggested that the mass had hematic content, which together with the clinical features, indicated that laparotomy should be performed.

The workhorse of anterior skull base reconstruction remains the nasoseptal or Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap. Despite its success, the nasoseptal flap is limited in its ability to reach extremely anterior defects including those involving the frontal break, posterior frontal table, and anterior cribiform plate. Alternative approaches utilizing anteriorly pedicled flaps have been described which exploit the vascular supply to the anterior septum and lateral nasal wall. The diminutive nature of the anterior septal blood supply has led to the elaboration of a bipedicled anterior septal flap which is capable of reliable reconstruction of both the frontal beak as well as posterior frontal table defects. Similarly anteriorly based inferior turbinate flaps pedicled largely on anterior ethmoid arborizations have been used successfully to reconstruct anterior defects.

All surgical steps were performed with hand assistance.\nOperative time was 210\u00a0min, and estimated blood loss was 300\u00a0ml. Postoperative was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Histological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was free of disease after 18\u00a0months of follow-up.\nOur video shows a standardized operative strategy in which the hand assistance plays important role. Posterosuperior segments of the liver are still less often approached by laparoscopic surgery as a result of its limitations on visualization, mobilization, pedicle control, and parenchymal transection.1 (,) 3 (,) 6 Hand assistance helps solve these issues, making assisted resection easier than a purely laparoscopic approach and more advantageous over the open technique, providing the benefits of laparoscopy without compromising oncological safety.7.", "journal": "Annals of surgical oncology", "date": "2012-12-18", "authors": ["PauloHerman", "Jaime Arthur PirolaKr\u00fcger", "Marcos Vin\u00edciusPerini", "Fabr\u00edcio FerreiraCoelho", "Renato MicelliLupinacci"], "doi": "10.1245/s10434-012-2750-3"}
{"title": "Procedure for decellularization of porcine heart by retrograde coronary perfusion.", "abstract": "Perfusion-based whole organ decellularization has recently gained interest in the field of tissue engineering as a means to create site-specific extracellular matrix scaffolds, while largely preserving the native architecture of the scaffold. To date, this approach has been utilized in a variety of organ systems, including the heart, lung, and liver (1-5). Previous decellularization methods for tissues without an easily accessible vascular network have relied upon prolonged exposure of tissue to solutions of detergents, acids, or enzymatic treatments as a means to remove the cellular and nuclear components from the surrounding extracellular environment(6-8). However, the effectiveness of these methods hinged upon the ability of the solutions to permeate the tissue via diffusion. In contrast, perfusion of organs through the natural vascular system effectively reduced the diffusion distance and facilitated transport of decellularization agents into the tissue and cellular components out of the tissue. Herein, we describe a method to fully decellularize an intact porcine heart through coronary retrograde perfusion. The protocol yielded a fully decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (c-ECM) scaffold with the three-dimensional structure of the heart intact. Our method used a series of enzymes, detergents, and acids coupled with hypertonic and hypotonic rinses to aid in the lysis and removal of cells. The protocol used a Trypsin solution to detach cells from the matrix followed by Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate solutions to aid in removal of cellular material. The described protocol also uses perfusion speeds of greater than 2 L/min for extended periods of time. The high flow rate, coupled with solution changes allowed transport of agents to the tissue without contamination of cellular debris and ensured effective rinsing of the tissue. The described method removed all nuclear material from native porcine cardiac tissue, creating a site-specific cardiac ECM scaffold that can be used for a variety of applications.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-12-18", "authors": ["Nathaniel TRemlinger", "Peter DWearden", "Thomas WGilbert"], "doi": "10.3791/50059"}

As hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) is capable to potentially increase the anticancer effect of cytostatics, we herein studied whether HAI of cetuximab (CE) as a single agent or in combination with oxaliplatin (OX) exerts increased anticancer effects compared to the systemic application (SYS) of the drugs.\nWAG/Rij rats were randomized to eight groups and underwent 10 days after subcapsular hepatic tumor implantation either HAI or SYS of CE, OX, or the combination of both agents (CE + OX). Saline-treated animals served as controls. Tumor volume was measured at days 10 and 13 using three-dimensional ultrasound. On day 13, liver and tumor tissue was sampled for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.\nIn controls, the tumor volume significantly increased from day 10 to 13. Application of OX alone via HAI or SYS did not inhibit tumor growth compared to controls. SYS of CE or CE + OX did also not reduce tumor growth.

Here, we studied the expression pattern of the transcription factor Sox17 in the vasculature of murine and human tumors and investigated the function of Sox17 during tumor angiogenesis using Sox17 genetic mouse models. Sox17 was specifically expressed in tECs in a heterogeneous pattern; in particular, strong Sox17 expression distinguished tECs with high VEGFR2 expression. Whereas overexpression of Sox17 in tECs promoted tumor angiogenesis and vascular abnormalities, Sox17 deletion in tECs reduced tumor angiogenesis and normalized tumor vessels, inhibiting tumor growth. Tumor vessel normalization by Sox17 deletion was long lasting, improved anticancer drug delivery into tumors, and inhibited tumor metastasis. Sox17 promoted endothelial sprouting behavior and upregulated VEGFR2 expression in a cell-intrinsic manner. Moreover, Sox17 increased the percentage of tumor-associated CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells within tumors. The vascular effects of Sox17 persisted throughout tumor growth. Interestingly, Sox17 expression specific to tECs was also observed in highly vascularized human glioblastoma samples.

{"title": "3D Imaging of vascular networks for biophysical modeling of perfusion distribution within the heart.", "abstract": "One of the main determinants of perfusion distribution within an organ is the structure of its vascular network. Past studies were based on angiography or corrosion casting and lacked quantitative three dimensional, 3D, representation. Based on branching rules and other properties derived from such imaging, 3D vascular tree models were generated which were rather useful for generating and testing hypotheses on perfusion distribution in organs. Progress in advanced computational models for prediction of perfusion distribution has raised the need for more realistic representations of vascular trees with higher resolution. This paper presents an overview of the different methods developed over time for imaging and modeling the structure of vascular networks and perfusion distribution, with a focus on the heart. The strengths and limitations of these different techniques are discussed. Episcopic fluorescent imaging using a cryomicrotome is presently being developed in different laboratories. This technique is discussed in more detail, since it provides high-resolution 3D structural information that is important for the development and validation of biophysical models but also for studying the adaptations of vascular networks to diseases. An added advantage of this method being is the ability to measure local tissue perfusion. Clinically, indices for patient-specific coronary stenosis evaluation derived from vascular networks have been proposed and high-resolution noninvasive methods for perfusion distribution are in development. All these techniques depend on a proper representation of the relevant vascular network structures.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2012-12-15", "authors": ["Jeroen P H Mvan den Wijngaard", "Janina C VSchwarz", "Pepijnvan Horssen", "Monique G J T Bvan Lier", "Johannes G GDobbe", "Jos A ESpaan", "MariaSiebes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.11.027"}

The BI, sized for implantation within a fold of intestinal mesentery, consists of a disk-shaped, polyvinyl alcohol sponge infused with a type I collagen hydrogel that contains dispersed donor islets. To promote islet vascularization, the BI incorporates a spherical alginate hydrogel for sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). BIs that contained 450-500 islets from syngeneic (C57Bl/6) donors and 20 ng of VEGF reversed streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in 100% of mice (8/8), whereas BIs that contained an equivalent number of islets, but which lacked VEGF, reversed STZ-induced diabetes in only 62.5% of mice (5/8). Between these \"+VEGF\" and \"-VEGF\" groups, the time to achieve normoglycemia (8-18 days after implantation) did not differ statistically; however, transitory, postoperative hypoglycemia was markedly reduced in the +VEGF group relative to the -VEGF group. Notably, none of the mice that achieved normoglycemia in these two groups required exogenous insulin therapy once the BIs began to fully regulate levels of blood glucose. Moreover, the transplanted mice responded to glucose challenge in a near-normal manner, as compared to the responses of healthy, nondiabetic (control) mice that had not received STZ.

Previous studies have demonstrated that physical environments and mechanical force can influence MSC fate, indicating that these factors may be favorable inducers for clinical treatment. Our previous study found that MSCs are spread with a spindle shape when cultured in normal gravity (NG), and under modeled microgravity (MMG) for 72\u00a0h, they become unspread and round and their cytoskeleton fibers are reorganized. These morphological changes affected the function of MSCs through the activity of RhoA. We examined the responses of MSCs under MMG stimulation, followed with VEGF differentiation. We found that MSCs under MMG for 72\u00a0h were differentiated into endothelial-like cells by detecting the expression of endothelial-specific molecules (Flk-1 and vWF), which were also able to form a capillary network. Their endothelial differentiation potential was improved under MMG compared with that under NG. We believe that this method is a novel choice of MMG stimulation for neovascularization.

Sphingolipidomic analysis detected erythrocyte and plasma S1P as well as high plasma ceramides and sphingosine. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of s1pr1 causes global and pericardial edema, loss of blood circulation, and vascular defects characterized by both reduced vascularization in intersegmental vessels, decreased proliferation of intersegmental and axial vessels, and hypersprouting in the caudal vein plexus. The s1pr2 gene was previously characterized as a regulator of cell migration and heart development, but its role in angiogenesis is not known. However, when expression of both s1pr1 and s1pr2 is suppressed, severely reduced vascular development of the intersegmental vessels was observed with doses of the s1pr1 morpholino that alone did not cause any discernible vascular defects, suggesting that s1pr1 and s1pr2 function cooperatively to regulate vascular development in zebrafish.

Therefore, \u03b2-elemene has great potential in clinical applications. However, the mechanism of \u03b2-elemene antitumor activity is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether \u03b2-elemene is able to repress the proliferation of T24 bladder carcinoma cells through regulation of the expression of the tumor suppressor gene, Smad4. Results of a methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay indicated that the proliferation of T24 cells was repressed by \u03b2-elemene in a time- and concentration\u2011dependent manner. The lowest concentration of \u03b2-elemene to inhibit cell survival by >50% was determined using IC50 software. Microscopic observation also demonstrated the potential of \u03b2-elemene to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of the Smad4 protein and mRNA was upregulated by treatment with \u03b2-elemene.

The mechanisms by which MSCs modulate the immune response are still under thorough investigation, but these most likely involve expression of local factors influencing T-cell regulation, modulation of cytokine expression (e.g., IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, etc.), and interactions with dendritic or antigen presenting cells.

Current therapeutics are limited by delivery vehicles that do not address spatial and temporal aspects of healing. The aim of this study was to engineer biotherapeutic delivery materials to harness endogenous cell repair to enhance myocardial repair and function. We have previously engineered poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels to present cell adhesive motifs and deliver VEGF to promote vascularization in vivo. In the current study, bioactive hydrogels with a protease-degradable crosslinker were loaded with hepatocyte and vascular endothelial growth factors (HGF and VEGF, respectively) and delivered to the infarcted myocardium of rats. Release of both growth factors was accelerated in the presence of collagenase due to hydrogel degradation. When delivered to the border zones following ischemia-reperfusion injury, there was no acute effect on cardiac function as measured by echocardiography. Over time there was a significant increase in angiogenesis, stem cell recruitment, and a decrease in fibrosis in the dual growth factor delivery group that was significant compared with single growth factor therapy. This led to an improvement in chronic function as measured by both invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography.

To assess the role of complement during ovarian cancer progression, we crossed two strains of mice with genetic complement deficiencies with transgenic mice that develop epithelial ovarian cancer (TgMISIIR-TAg). TgMISIIR-TAg mice fully or partially deficient for complement factor 3 (C3) (Tg(+)C3(KO) and Tg(+)C3(HET), respectively) or fully deficient for complement factor C5a receptor (C5aR) (Tg(+)C5aR(KO)) develop either no ovarian tumors or tumors that were small and poorly vascularized compared to wild-type littermates (Tg(+)C3(WT), Tg(+)C5aR(WT)). The percentage of tumor infiltrating immune cells in Tg(+)C3(HET) tumors compared to Tg(+)C3(WT) controls was either similar (macrophages, B cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells), elevated (effector T cells), or decreased (regulatory T cells). Regardless of these ratios, cytokine production by immune cells taken from Tg(+)C3(HET) tumors was reduced on stimulation compared to Tg(+)C3(WT) controls. Interestingly, CD31(+) endothelial cell (EC) function in angiogenesis was significantly impaired in both C3(KO) and C5aR(KO) mice. Further, using the C5aR antagonist PMX53, tube formation of ECs was shown to be C5a-dependent, possibly through interactions with the VEGF(165) but not VEGF(121) isoform. Finally, the mouse VEGF(164) transcript was underexpressed in C3(KO) livers compare to C3(WT) livers.

It rarely involves the small tubular bones of the feet. We present an unusual case of LGCOS arising in the third metatarsal bone of a 16-year-old boy. The radiographic appearance was suggestive of a benign lesion. An open biopsy was performed and the initial diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia. The patient underwent curettage of the lesion and packing of the bony defect with a synthetic bone substitute. Histologically, the curetted specimens consisted of spindle cells admixed with irregular bony trabeculae and osteoid. The spindle cells were fairly uniform with mild atypia, and cellularity varied from low to high. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were focally-positive for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and p53, but negative for murine double minute-2. The MIB-1 labeling index was 36.7% in the highest focus. Cytogenetic analysis exhibited the following clonal karyotypic abnormalities: 48,XY,del(6)(p11),add(8)(q24),add(12)(p11.2),+mar1,+mar-2. Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that marker chromosomes were composed mainly of chromosome 6. Metaphase-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed a high-level amplification of 6p12-p21 and gains of 8q21-q24, 10p15, 12q13-q15, and 16q23-q24. Based on these findings, the final diagnosis was revised to LGCOS and the patient was treated with an additional wide excision, followed by reconstruction with a free-vascularized osteocutaneous scapular flap.

Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), based on the theory of inflammation and neoangiogenesis, seems to have a great potential for the detection of unstable plaques. The purpose of our work was to compare echogenicity of the plaque (evaluated with the Grey Scale Median; GSM), the degree of stenosis and CEUS with the histopathological findings.\nPatients with indication for internal carotid endarterectomy (CEA) underwent a preoperative imaging study with B-mode echo Doppler Ultrasound and with CEUS. The contrast enhancement of the plaque was described with two parameters: the maximum and mean signal intensity (SImax, SImean). After the surgical operation the removed plaque is sent to the pathology laboratory for the measurement of the neoangiogenesis (vessel density, VD).\nFifty-one consecutive patients were enrolled (12 symptomatic, 39 asymptomatic). Analysis pointed out significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients for: GSM median 14 (I quartile 11.5; III quartile 23) versus 32.5 (27-42.25) (P=0.012); SI (%) SImax 30 (29-35.5) versus 24 (19.7-27) (P<0.001) and SImean 23 (20.5-27) versus 15 (8-18.25) (P<0.001); VD (vessels/mm2) 41.5 (30-70) versus 12.6 (7-18.6) (P<0.001), respectively. Moreover, a cut-off value was determined between the two groups for each parameter: GSM:25, SImax:28%, SImean:20%, and VD: 25/mm2. Combined analysis showed that plaques with greater contrast enhancement had more newly formed capillaries and that plaques with lower GSM values correlated with greater vascularization.\nThe study confirms that in vitro neoangiogenesis, contrast enhancement and stability of the plaque are strongly connected and CEUS appears to be one of the most promising tools for the stratification of the carotid plaque vulnerability.", "journal": "International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["GVaretto", "LGibello", "LBergamasco", "ASapino", "ICastellano", "PGarneri", "PRispoli"], "doi": null}

Excised corneal tissue from one affected individual was examined histologically. We used PCR and direct sequencing to identify mutation of the coding regions of the KRT3 and KRT12 genes.\nCases had an unusually severe phenotype with large numbers of intraepithelial cysts present from infancy and they developed subepithelial fibrosis in the second to third decade. In some individuals, the cornea became superficially vascularized, a change accompanied by the loss of clinically obvious epithelial cysts. Visual loss from amblyopia or corneal opacity was common and four individuals were visually impaired (\u22646/24 bilaterally) and one was blind (<6/60 bilaterally). In all affected family members, there was a heterozygous missense mutation c. 395T>C (p. L132P) in exon 1 of the KRT12 gene, which codes for the helix-initiation motif of the K12 polypeptide. This sequence change was not found in unaffected family members or in 100 unaffected controls.\nThe Leu132Pro missense mutation is within the helix-initiation motif of the keratin and is predicted to result in a significant structural change of the K12 protein.

{"title": "The effect of interstitial pressure on tumor growth: coupling with the blood and lymphatic vascular systems.", "abstract": "The flow of interstitial fluid and the associated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in solid tumors and surrounding host tissues have been identified as critical elements in cancer growth and vascularization. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that tumors may present elevated IFP, which can be a formidable physical barrier for delivery of cell nutrients and small molecules into the tumor. Elevated IFP may also exacerbate gradients of biochemical signals such as angiogenic factors released by tumors into the surrounding tissues. These studies have helped to understand both biochemical signaling and treatment prognosis. Building upon previous work, here we develop a vascular tumor growth model by coupling a continuous growth model with a discrete angiogenesis model. We include fluid/oxygen extravasation as well as a continuous lymphatic field, and study the micro-environmental fluid dynamics and their effect on tumor growth by accounting for blood flow, transcapillary fluid flux, interstitial fluid flow, and lymphatic drainage. We thus elucidate further the non-trivial relationship between the key elements contributing to the effects of interstitial pressure in solid tumors. In particular, we study the effect of IFP on oxygen extravasation and show that small blood/lymphatic vessel resistance and collapse may contribute to lower transcapillary fluid/oxygen flux, thus decreasing the rate of tumor growth. We also investigate the effect of tumor vascular pathologies, including elevated vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivities inside the tumor as well as diminished osmotic pressure differences, on the fluid flow across the tumor capillary bed, the lymphatic drainage, and the IFP. Our results reveal that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity together with poor lymphatic function is the root cause of the development of plateau profiles of the IFP in the tumor, which have been observed in experiments, and contributes to a more uniform distribution of oxygen, solid tumor pressure and a broad-based collapse of the tumor lymphatics. We also find that the rate that IFF is fluxed into the lymphatics and host tissue is largely controlled by an elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity in the tumor. We discuss the implications of these results on microenvironmental transport barriers, and the tumor invasive and metastatic potential. Our results suggest the possibility of developing strategies of targeting tumor cells based on the cues in the interstitial fluid.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["MinWu", "Hermann BFrieboes", "Steven RMcDougall", "Mark A JChaplain", "VittorioCristini", "JohnLowengrub"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.031"}

It is a marker and intracellular inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We previously demonstrated that stable expression of GBP-1 in murine endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) induces their premature differentiation and decreases their migration capacity in vitro and in vivo. The goal of the present study was to assess the antiangiogenic capacity of EPC expressing GBP-1 (GBP-1-EPC) and their impact on blood vessel formation in an axially vascularized 3-D bioartificial construct in vivo.\nFunctional in vitro testing demonstrated a significant increase in VEGF secretion by GBP-1-EPC after induction of cell differentiation. Undifferentiated GBP-1-EPC, however, did not secrete increased levels of VEGF compared to undifferentiated control EPC expressing an empty vector (EV-EPC). In our In vivo experiments, we generated axially vascularized tissue-engineered 3-D constructs. The new vascular network arises from an arterio-venous loop (AVL) embedded in a fibrin matrix inside a separation chamber. Total surface area of the construct as calculated from cross sections was larger after transplantation of GBP-1-EPC compared to control EV-EPC. This indicated reduced formation of fibrovascular tissue and less resorption of fibrin matrix compared to constructs containing EV-EPC. Most notably, the ratio of blood vessel surface area over total construct surface area in construct cross sections was significantly reduced in the presence of GBP-1-EPC. This indicates a significant reduction of blood vessel density and thereby inhibition of blood vessel formation from the AVL constructs caused by GBP-1. In addition, GBP-1 expressed from EPC significantly reduced cell apoptosis compared to GBP-1-negative controls.\nTransgenic EPC expressing the proinflammatory antiangiogenic GTPase GBP-1 can reduce blood vessel density and inhibit apoptosis in a developing bioartificial vascular network and may become a new powerful tool to manipulate angiogenetic processes in tissue engineering and other pathological conditions such as tumour angiogenesis.", "journal": "BMC biotechnology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["OliverBleiziffer", "MatthiasHammon", "AndreasArkudas", "Christian DTaeger", "Justus PBeier", "KerstinAmann", "ElisabethNaschberger", "MichaelSt\u00fcrzl", "Raymund EHorch", "UlrichKneser"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6750-12-94\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1161/01.RES.85.3.221\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192138\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248369\n10.1093/emboj/20.20.5568\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64452-5\n10.1093/emboj/cdg382\n10.1016/j.advenzreg.2005.02.011\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.04.003\n10.1172/JCI6889\n10.1038/nm0603-702\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.245993\n10.1016/j.jvs.2011.01.074\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181d4c360\n10.3899/jrheum.091341\n10.1172/JCI36389\n10.1002/ijc.23764\n10.2337/db10-0875\n10.3899/jrheum.090782\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0477\n10.1038/labinvest.3700461\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1721"}
{"title": "Life-long preservation of the regenerative capacity in the fin and heart in zebrafish.", "abstract": "The zebrafish is a widely used model animal to study the regeneration of organs, such as the fin and heart. Their average lifetime is about 3 years, and recent studies have shown that zebrafish exhibit aging-related degeneration, suggesting the possibility that aging might affect regenerative potential. In order to investigate this possibility, we compared regeneration of the fin and heart after experimental amputation in young (6-12 month old) and old (26-36 month old) fish. Comparison of recovery rate of the caudal fin, measured every two or three days from one day post amputation until 13 days post amputation, show that fins in young and old fish regenerate at a similar rate. In the heart, myocardium regeneration and cardiomyocyte proliferation occurred similarly in the two groups. Moreover, neo-vascularization, as well as activation of fibroblast growth factor signaling, which is required for neo-vascularization, occurred similarly.

{"title": "Msx1 is expressed in retina endothelial cells at artery branching sites.", "abstract": "Msx1 and Msx2 encode homeodomain transcription factors that play a role in several embryonic developmental processes. Previously, we have shown that in the adult mouse, Msx1(lacZ) is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and pericytes, and that Msx2(lacZ) is also expressed in VSMCs as well as in a few endothelial cells (ECs). The mouse retina and choroid are two highly vascularized tissues. Vessel alterations in the retina are associated with several human diseases and the retina has been intensely used for angiogenesis studies, whereas the choroid has been much less investigated. Using the Msx1(lacZ) and Msx2(lacZ) reporter alleles, we observed that Msx2 is not expressed in the eye vascular tree in contrast to Msx1, for which we establish the spatial and temporal expression pattern in these tissues. In the retina, expression of Msx1 takes place from P3, and by P10, it becomes confined to a subpopulation of ECs at branching points of superficial arterioles. These branching sites are characterized by a subpopulation of mural cells that also show specific expression programs. Specific Msx gene inactivation in the endothelium, using Msx1 and Msx2 conditional mutant alleles together with a Tie2-Cre transgene, did not lead to conspicuous structural defects in the retinal vascular network. Expression of Msx1 at branching sites might therefore be linked to vessel physiology. The retinal blood flow is autonomously regulated and perfusion of capillaries has been proposed to depend on arteriolar precapillary structures that might be the sites for Msx1 expression. On the other hand, branching sites are subject to shear stress that might induce Msx1 expression. In the choroid vascular layer Msx1(lacZ) is expressed more broadly and dynamically. At birth Msx1(lacZ) expression takes place in the endothelium but at P21 its expression has shifted towards the mural layer. We discuss the possible functions of Msx1 in the eye vasculature.", "journal": "Biology open", "date": "2012-12-06", "authors": ["MiguelLopes", "OlivierGoupille", "C\u00e9cileSaint Cloment", "Beno\u00eetRobert"], "doi": "10.1242/bio.2012017\n10.1146/annurev.me.18.020167.000311\n10.1159/000087983\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.07.001\n10.1242/dev.00609\n10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.002135\n10.1023/A%3A1011965307612\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.025\n10.1002/dvg.20390\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.061\n10.1167/iovs.04-0848\n10.1002/1097-4652(200009)184%3A3%3C301%3A%3AAID-JCP3%3E3.0.CO%3B2-H\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3065-04.2004\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.05.037\n10.1007/s10456-007-9065-1\n10.1002/dvg.20316\n10.1016/j.mvr.2010.02.005\n10.1002/dvdy.21619\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.1954.tb15463.x\n10.1016/j.modgep.2006.11.002\n10.1073/pnas.102650499\n10.1016/S0925-4773(97)00065-8\n10.1167/iovs.03-1312\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.10.021\n10.1093/jmicro/50.2.125\n10.1242/dev.02072\n10.1038/nm0603-685\n10.1006/dbio.2000.0106\n10.1242/dev.01877\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.04.038\n10.1242/dev.063214\n10.1098/rstb.1999.0471\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4048-05.2006\n10.1016/S0960-9822(07)00489-7\n10.1002/dvg.20335\n10.1083/jcb.113.1.147\n10.1152/ajpheart.00829.2010\n10.1083/jcb.105.3.1455\n10.1002/dvdy.1200\n10.1038/nature05193\n10.1161/01.RES.0000111803.92923.D6\n10.1016/S0361-9230(99)00260-9\n10.1387/ijdb.041895ms\n10.1083/jcb.109.1.309\n10.1038/74231\n10.1016/0014-4835(92)90161-K\n10.3389/fnene.2010.00128\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1182/blood-2011-10-384560\n10.1196/annals.1346.036\n10.1161/01.RES.0000068377.01063.79\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.207415\n10.1016/0026-2862(76)90008-X\n10.1167/iovs.02-0317\n10.1093/hmg/8.5.723\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.047\n10.1038/nn980"}
{"title": "Expansion and differentiation of human primary osteoblasts in two- and three-dimensional culture.", "abstract": "Despite the regenerative capability of bone, treatment of large defects often requires bone grafts. The challenge for bone grafting is to establish rapid and sufficient vascularization. Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids consisting of the relevant cell types can be used as \"mini tissues\" to study the complexity of angiogenesis. We investigated two-dimensional (2D) expansion, differentiation and characterization of primary osteoblasts as steps toward the establishment of 3D multicellular spheroids. Supplementation of cell culture medium with vitamin D(3) induces the osteocalcin expression of osteoblasts. An increased osteocalcin concentration of 10.8 \u00b1 0.58 ng/ml could be measured after 19 days in supplemented medium. Vitamin D(3) has no influence on the expression of alkaline phosphatase or the deposition of calcium. Expression of these additional osteogenic markers requires addition of a cocktail of osteogenic factors that, conversely, have no influence on the expression of osteocalcin. Supplementation of the cell culture medium with both vitamin D(3) and a cocktail of osteogenic factors is recommended to produce an osteoblast phenotype that secretes osteocalcin, expresses alkaline phosphatase and deposits calcium. In such a supplemented medium, a mean osteocalcin concentration of 11.63 \u00b1 4.85 ng/ml was secreted by the osteoblasts. Distinguishing osteoblasts and fibroblasts remains a challenge. Neither differentiated nor undifferentiated osteoblasts can be distinguished from fibroblasts by the expression of CD90, ED-A-fibronectin or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin; however, these cell types exhibit clear differences in their growth characteristics. Osteoblasts can be arranged as 3D spheroids by coating the bottom of the cell culture device with agarose. The cellular composition of 3D multicellular spheroids can be evaluated quantitatively using vital fluorescence labeling techniques.

{"title": "Antiproliferative effects of fluoxetine on colon cancer cells and in a colonic carcinogen mouse model.", "abstract": "The antidepressant fluoxetine has been under discussion because of its potential influence on cancer risk. It was found to inhibit the development of carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions in colon tissue, but the mechanisms of action are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated anti-proliferative effects, and used HT29 colon tumor cells in vitro, as well as C57BL/6 mice exposed to intra-rectal treatment with the carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) as models. Fluoxetine increased the percentage of HT29 cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of cell-cycle, and the expression of p27 protein. This was not related to an induction of apoptosis, reactive oxygen species or DNA damage. In vivo, fluoxetine reduced the development of MNNG-induced dysplasia and vascularization-related dysplasia in colon tissue, which was analyzed by histopathological techniques. An anti-proliferative potential of fluoxetine was observed in epithelial and stromal areas. It was accompanied by a reduction of VEGF expression and of the number of cells with angiogenic potential, such as CD133, CD34, and CD31-positive cell clusters. Taken together, our findings suggest that fluoxetine treatment targets steps of early colon carcinogenesis.

{"title": "The developing chicken yolk sac acquires nutrient transport competence by an orchestrated differentiation process of its endodermal epithelial cells.", "abstract": "During chicken yolk sac (YS) growth, mesodermal cells in the area vasculosa follow the migrating endodermal epithelial cell (EEC) layer in the area vitellina. Ultimately, these cells form the vascularized YS that functions in nutrient transfer to the embryo. How and when EECs, with their apical aspect directly contacting the oocytic yolk, acquire the ability to take up yolk macromolecules during the vitellina-to-vasculosa transition has not been investigated. In addressing these questions, we found that with progressive vascularization, the expression level in EECs of the nutrient receptor triad, LRP2-cubilin-amnionless, changes significantly. The receptor complex, competent for uptake of yolk proteins, is produced by EECs in the area vasculosa but not in the area vitellina. Yolk components endocytosed by LRP2-cubilin-amnionless, preformed and newly formed lipid droplets, and yolk-derived very low density lipoprotein, shown to be efficiently endocytosed and lysosomally processed by EECs, probably provide substrates for resynthesis and secretion of nutrients, such as lipoproteins. In fact, as directly demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments, EECs in the vascularized, but not in the avascular, region efficiently produce and secrete lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apoB, and/or apoA-V. In contrast, perilipin 2, a lipid droplet-stabilizing protein, is produced exclusively by the EECs of the area vitellina. These data suggest a differentiation process that orchestrates the vascularization of the developing YS with the induction of yolk uptake and lipoprotein secretion by EECs to ensure embryo nutrition.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-12-05", "authors": ["RaimundBauer", "Julia APlieschnig", "ThomasFinkes", "BarbaraRiegler", "MarcelaHermann", "Wolfgang JSchneider"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.393090"}

When possible, fixed prostheses are the best option, because they guarantee stability, but they should be made so that the operator can remove them periodically to check the health of the oral tissues underneath and to intercept any relapse of the tumor. This study analyses two cases of patients surgically treated for a tumor of the upper maxilla at the Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgery of Sapienza University, in Rome. In the first case the surgical site was covered with local flaps, and the patient was rehabilitated with an implant-supported removable prosthesis. In the second case the maxilla was reconstructed with a fibula vascularized free flap, and the patient was rehabilitated with an implant-supported prosthesis screwed to a titanium bar solidarizing the implants. Therefore, this prosthesis was fixed, but could be removed by the dentist. The different approach to these two cases was influenced by the different anatomic situations after the reconstruction. It is important for the dentist to approach these patients knowing the kind of surgery they received because this aspect will influence rehabilitative choices.

{"title": "Functional imaging of brown fat in mice with 18F-FDG micro-PET/CT.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) differs from white adipose tissue (WAT) by its discrete location and a brown-red color due to rich vascularization and high density of mitochondria. BAT plays a major role in energy expenditure and non-shivering thermogenesis in newborn mammals as well as the adults (1). BAT-mediated thermogenesis is highly regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, predominantly via \u03b2 adrenergic receptor (2, 3). Recent studies have shown that BAT activities in human adults are negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and other diabetic parameters (4-6). BAT has thus been proposed as a potential target for anti-obesity/anti-diabetes therapy focusing on modulation of energy balance (6-8). While several cold challenge-based positron emission tomography (PET) methods are established for detecting human BAT (9-13), there is essentially no standardized protocol for imaging and quantification of BAT in small animal models such as mice. Here we describe a robust PET/CT imaging method for functional assessment of BAT in mice. Briefly, adult C57BL/6J mice were cold treated under fasting conditions for a duration of 4 hours before they received one dose of (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The mice were remained in the cold for one additional hour post FDG injection, and then scanned with a small animal-dedicated micro-PET/CT system. The acquired PET images were co-registered with the CT images for anatomical references and analyzed for FDG uptake in the interscapular BAT area to present BAT activity. This standardized cold-treatment and imaging protocol has been validated through testing BAT activities during pharmacological interventions, for example, the suppressed BAT activation by the treatment of \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (14, 15), or the enhanced BAT activation by \u03b23 agonist BRL37344 (16).

Longer-segment stenosis can sometimes be treated using dilation, laser therapy, bronchoscopic stent insertion and segmental resection and reconstruction. Long-segment restenosis with a buildup of scar tissue due to successful resection surgery in the past represents a particular therapeutic challenge and a sufficiently vascularized transplant may be the only option. We describe the case of a 37-year-old patient who underwent a tracheal reconstruction using a mucosa-lined radial forearm flap. Subsequent to a traumatic laryngotracheal fracture, long-term ventilation and multiple surgical interventions, the patient had developed a functionally relevant subglottic stenosis (5.5 cm). Following longitudinal anterior resection of the trachea 1 cm above and below the stenosis, a Dumon\u00ae stent was inserted. Simultaneously, a radial forearm fascia flap was harvested, as were two full-thickness buccal mucosa grafts, which were sutured onto the subcutaneous tissue and fascia of the forearm flap. Beginning caudally, the mucosa-lined flap was then sutured, air-tight, into the anterior tracheal defect with the mucosa facing the lumen. Finally, end-to-end anastomosis connected the blood vessels of the radial forearm flap to the recipient blood vessels in the neck. The patient was successfully extubated after 24 h and discharged after 5 days. A postoperative CT scan revealed optimal placement of the stent and the patient's speech and breathing were sufficiently re-established. The stent was removed bronchoscopically 6 weeks after surgery. Examinations during the 6-month follow-up period showed that the diameter of the reconstructed airway was retained and the patient remained symptom-free.", "journal": "HNO", "date": "2012-12-04", "authors": ["MMandapathil", "T KHoffmann", "LFreitag", "NReddy", "SLang", "PDelaere"], "doi": "10.1007/s00106-012-2624-9"}

The mean age of our patients was 39.7 years, with an equal distribution of men and women. The mean follow-up was 16.4 months. Neoplastic causes accounted for the majority of skull base lesions (11/18 cases), followed by traumatic lesions (5/18 cases). Other causes of lesions in our study included encephalocele (1 case), and infection (1 case). The most common location for skull base defects in our study was the anterior skull base (14/18 cases). Other locations included the infratemporal fossa (1 case). The mean size of defect repaired was 4.46 cm, and the mean area was 12.85 cm(2). Repair with local vascularized tissue flaps resulted in a success rate of 87.5%. Moreover, our meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid leak rate was only 11.1% after repair.\nLocal vascularized flap utilization in open reconstruction of the skull base has an excellent success rate, with no second donor site morbidity. The success is comparable to free tissue transplant reconstruction and should be in the armamentarium of every neurosurgeon and skull base surgeon.

{"title": "Comparison between PUN and Tofts models in the quantification of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging.", "abstract": "Dynamic contrast-enhanced study in magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an important tool in oncology to visualize tissues vascularization and to define tumour aggressiveness on the basis of an altered perfusion and permeability. Pharmacokinetic models are generally used to extract hemodynamic parameters, providing a quantitative description of the contrast uptake and wash-out. Empirical functions can also be used to fit experimental data without the need of any assumption about tumour physiology, as in pharmacokinetic models, increasing their diagnostic utility, in particular when automatic diagnosis systems are implemented on the basis of an MRI multi-parametric approach. Phenomenological universalities (PUN) represent a novel tool for experimental research and offer a simple and systematic method to represent a set of data independent of the application field. DCE-MRI acquisitions can thus be advantageously evaluated by the extended PUN class, providing a convenient diagnostic tool to analyse functional studies, adding a new set of features for the classification of malignant and benign lesions in computer aided detection systems. In this work the Tofts pharmacokinetic model and the class EU1 generated by the PUN description were compared in the study of DCE-MRI of the prostate, evaluating complexity of model implementation, goodness of fitting results, classification performances and computational cost. The mean R\u00b2 obtained with the EU1 and Tofts model were equal to 0.96 and 0.90, respectively, and the classification performances achieved by the EU1 model and the Tofts implementation discriminated malignant from benign tissues with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal to 0.92 and 0.91, respectively.

From January to July 2010, 375 ultrasound breast examinations were conducted. The study enrolled 80 women aged 17-83, with 99 solid, focal lesions present in breasts, which were qualified for pathomorphological verification on the basis of the ultrasound examination. All patients underwent: the interview, physical examination, ultrasound examination and sonoelastography. The ultrasound features of the lesions, their vascularization patterns in the Doppler examination as well as the adjacent tissues were determined. Next, the focal lesions were categorized according to the BIRADS-US classification. The obtained results were analyzed statistically. In the group of 80 patients, 99 focal, solid lesions in breasts were visualized, including 39 neoplastic, malignant lesions (group I) and 60 lesions of benign nature (group II). The malignant lesions were often characterized by: greater size, irregular shape (34/39), prevalence of the anteroposterior dimension over the lateral-lateral dimension (22/39), acoustic shadowing (20/39), the margins not well-circumscribed (37/39), spiculated margins (16/39) and the presence of calcifications (14/39). The benign lesions were much more often hyper- and isoechogenic (14/60). In group I the lesions more often demonstrated the features of increased vascularization (29/39) and the presence of irregularly shaped vessels (23/29). This vascularization more often originated in the adjacent tissues. In the surroundings of the malignant neoplastic lesions, the presence of edema (16/39) and skin thickening (6/39) occurred more frequently and the abnormal axillary lymph nodes were more often diagnosed. The lesions of group I were assigned to the following BIRADS categories: BIRADS-US 4 (9 lesions) and BIRADS-US 5 (30 lesions). In group II, there was a prevalence of BIRADS-US 3 and 4 categories (58 lesions) and 2 lesions were classified to BIRADS-US 5 category. In the statistical analysis of the models based on BIRADS classification, it was demonstrated that BIRADS 4 showed the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity values of 173.6% in differentiation of the character of focal lesions in the breast (sensitivity 76.92%, specificity 96.67%).\nCelem pracy by\u0142a ocena warto\u015bci diagnostycznej badania ultrasonograficznego B-mode w diagnostyce r\u00f3\u017cnicowej litych zmian ogniskowych w piersiach, w odniesieniu do weryfikacji patomorfologicznej.

{"title": "Ultrasound assessment of selected peripheral nerves pathologies. Part II: Entrapment neuropathies of the lower limb.", "abstract": "Similarly to entrapment neuropathies of upper extremities, the ultrasound constitutes a valuable supplementation of diagnostic examinations performed in patients with suspicions of nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb. For many years, it was claimed that such pathologies were rare. This probably resulted from the lack of proper diagnostic tools (including high frequency ultrasound transducers) as well as the lack of sufficient knowledge in this area. In relation to the above, the symptoms of compression neuropathies were frequently interpreted as a manifestation of pathologies of the lumbar part of the spine or a other orthopedic disease (degenerative or overuse one). Consequently, many patients were treated ineffectively for many months and even, years which led to irreparable neurological changes and changes in the motor organ. Apart from a clinical examination, the diagnostics of entrapment neuropathies of lower limb is currently based on imaging tests (ultrasound, magnetic resonance) as well as functional assessments (electromyography). Magnetic resonance imaging is characterized by a relatively low resolution (as compared to ultrasound) which results in limited possibilities of morphological evaluation of the visualized pathology. Electromyography allows for the assessment of nerve function, but does not precisely determine the type and degree of change. This article presents examples of the most common entrapment neuropathies of the lower limb concerning the following nerves: sciatic, femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, fibular and its branches, tibial and its branches as well as sural. The pathomorphological basis of the neuropathies as well as corresponding ultrasound images are presented in this paper. Attention has been drawn to echogenicity, degree of vascularization and bundle presentation of the trunk of a pathological peripheral nerve.\nPodobnie jak w przypadku neuropatii uciskowych ko\u0144czyny g\u00f3rnej badanie ultrasonograficzne jest cennym uzupe\u0142nieniem bada\u0144 diagnostycznych przeprowadzanych u pacjent\u00f3w z podejrzeniem zespo\u0142\u00f3w uciskowych nerw\u00f3w ko\u0144czyny dolnej.

A significant portion of mistakes is caused by inappropriate quality of the apparatus, the presence of sonographic imaging artifacts, unfavorable anatomic variants or improper preparation of the patient for the examination. This article focuses on the examiner-related errors. They concern the evaluation of the liver size, echostructure and arterial and venous vascularization as well as inappropriate interpretation of the liver anatomic variants and the vascular and ductal structures localized inside of it.

{"title": "Concise review: clinical translation of wound healing therapies based on mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "There is enormous worldwide demand for therapies to promote the efficient resolution of hard-to-heal wounds with minimal appearance of scarring. Recent in vitro studies with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have identified numerous mechanisms by which these cells can promote the process of wound healing, and there is significant interest in the clinical translation of an MSC-based therapy to promote dermal regeneration. This review provides a systematic analysis of recent preclinical and clinical research to evaluate the use of MSCs in wound healing applications. These in vivo studies provide overwhelming evidence that MSCs can accelerate wound closure by modulating the inflammatory environment, promoting the formation of a well-vascularized granulation matrix, encouraging the migration of keratinocytes, and inhibiting apoptosis of wound healing cells. The trophic effects of MSC therapy also appear to augment wound healing in diabetic tissues, thereby preventing the formation of nonhealing ulcers. Finally, a number of delivery systems have been evaluated and indicate that MSCs could be the basis of a versatile therapy to fulfill the clinical needs for dermal regeneration. However, despite the apparent advantages of MSC-based therapies, there have been only limited clinical investigations of this type of therapy in humans. Thus, our review concludes with a discussion of the translational barriers that are limiting the widespread clinical use of MSCs to enhance wound healing.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2012-12-01", "authors": ["Wesley MJackson", "Leon JNesti", "Rocky STuan"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2011-0024"}

On the basis of a review of a 10-year in-house database and a review of the literature on CNS pathology involving the DGM nuclei in paediatric patients, we summarize the MR findings and clinical clues that may help the radiologist in the difficult differential diagnosis process. The terms \"acute\" and \"chronic\" refer to the clinical onset of the disease. MR imaging allows the detection of an injury, determination of its precise anatomical location and characterization of the signal changes. This, combined with a knowledge of specific MRI patterns, may be a roadmap to a definite diagnosis. Clinical history, physical and laboratory findings, timing of the MR examination and advanced MR imaging techniques (diffusion-weighted imaging and (1)H-MR spectroscopy), are crucial in some patients.", "journal": "Pediatric radiology", "date": "2012-12-01", "authors": ["Carlo CosimoQuattrocchi", "DanielaLongo", "Luciana NogueiraDelfino", "YuriErrante", "CostanzaAiello", "GiuseppeFariello", "BrunoBernardi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00247-012-2491-2"}
{"title": "Spongiosa primary development: a biochemical hypothesis by Turing patterns formations.", "abstract": "We propose a biochemical model describing the formation of primary spongiosa architecture through a bioregulatory model by metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It is assumed that MMP13 regulates cartilage degradation and the VEGF allows vascularization and advances in the ossification front through the presence of osteoblasts. The coupling of this set of molecules is represented by reaction-diffusion equations with parameters in the Turing space, creating a stable spatiotemporal pattern that leads to the formation of the trabeculae present in the spongy tissue. Experimental evidence has shown that the MMP13 regulates VEGF formation, and it is assumed that VEGF negatively regulates MMP13 formation. Thus, the patterns obtained by ossification may represent the primary spongiosa formation during endochondral ossification. Moreover, for the numerical solution, we used the finite element method with the Newton-Raphson method to approximate partial differential nonlinear equations. Ossification patterns obtained may represent the primary spongiosa formation during endochondral ossification.", "journal": "Computational and mathematical methods in medicine", "date": "2012-11-30", "authors": ["Oscar RodrigoL\u00f3pez-Vaca", "Diego AlexanderGarz\u00f3n-Alvarado"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/748302"}

Femoral diaphyseal bone was transplanted heterotopically from 46 Dark Agouti to 46 Lewis rats. Microvascular repair of the allotransplant nutrient pedicle was combined with intra-medullary implantation of an autogenous saphenous arteriovenous (AV) bundle and biodegradable microspheres containing buffer (control), rhBMP-2 or rhBMP-2 + VEGF.

After an 18 weeks survival period, we measured angiogenesis (capillary density) from the AV bundle and cortical bone blood flow. Both measures were greater in the combined (rhBMP-2 + VEGF) group than rhBMP-2 and control groups (p < 0.05). Osteoblast counts were also higher in the rhBMP-2 + VEGF group (p < 0.05). A trend towards greater bone formation was seen in both rhBMP2\u2009+ VGF and rhBMP2 groups as compared to controls (p = 0.059).

Describe the indications and contraindications for free flap reconstruction. 2. Describe the indications, anatomy, harvest technique, and advantages and disadvantages of the workhorse free flaps. 3. Describe the indications and contraindications for extremity replantation. 4. Describe the techniques and management for extremity replantation.\nMicrosurgical free flap reconstruction uses a multitude of surgical flaps available to meet the needs of the recipient site. These include cutaneous, muscle, bone, fascia, or some combination of these as available options. Furthermore, sophisticated reconstruction has been enhanced by the development of perforator flaps, enabling multicomponent reconstruction to be performed with reduced donor-site morbidity. It is mandatory that proper d\u00e9bridement of the defect be performed before reconstruction, and that the anastomosis is performed without tension or twisting outside of the zone of injury. There are indications for both musculocutaneous and perforator flaps, and selection is dependent on recipient-site characteristics in addition to function and aesthetics of both the recipient and donor sites. Muscle flaps provide well-vascularized pliable tissue and are used for deep space obliteration, whereas fasciocutaneous flaps are used for flatter, more superficial wounds. Microsurgical replantation of an amputated extremity offers a result that is usually superior to any other type of reconstruction. However, replantation of extremities involves more than microsurgery, as repair of bony and tendon injury must be undertaken as well.

Tumor resection represents the only potential cure. In cases of unresectable disease systemic chemotherapy (sCHT) remains the therapy of choice. Modern sCHT regimens including biological agents can induce tumor response that leads to curative surgery of initially unresectable mCRC. However, liver-directed therapy via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) may produce higher response rates than sCHT. Herein we studied whether a HAI of cetuximab (CE) plus bevacizumab (BE) with or without oxaliplatin (OX) can inhibit tumor growth in a rat model. WAG/Rij rats underwent subcapsular hepatic tumor implantation. After 10\u00a0days animals received either HAI or sCHT of CE plus BE, OX or all three drugs. Saline-treated animals served as controls. Tumor growth was estimated at day 10 and 13. On day 13 liver and tumor tissue was studied histologically and immunohistochemically. In controls the tumors grew about 50\u00a0%. OX alone was not capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In contrast, CE plus BE given as HAI significantly reduced tumor growth compared to sCHT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). HAI of CE plus BE combined with OX yielded an even more pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

{"title": "Characterization of Decellularized Heart Matrices as Biomaterials for Regular and Whole Organ Tissue Engineering and Initial ", "abstract": "Tissue engineering strategies, based on solid/porous scaffolds, suffer from several limitations, such as ineffective vascularization, poor cell distribution and organization within scaffold, in addition to low final cell density, among others. Therefore, the search for other tissue engineering approaches constitutes an active area of investigation. Decellularized matrices (DM) present major advantages compared to solid scaffolds, such as ideal chemical composition, the preservation of vascularization structure and perfect three-dimensional structure. In the present study, we aimed to characterize and investigate murine heart decellularized matrices as biomaterials for regular and whole organ tissue engineering. Heart decellularized matrices were characterized according to: 1. DNA content, through DNA quantificationo and PCR of isolated genomic DNA; 2. Histological structure, assessed after Hematoxylin and Eosin, as well as Masson's Trichrome stainings; 3. Surface nanostructure analysis, performed, using SEM. Those essays allowed us to conclude that DM was indeed decellularized, with preserved extracellular matrix structure. Following characterization, decellularized heart slices were seeded with induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPS). As expected, but - to the best of our knowledge - never shown before, decellularization of murine heart matrices maintained matrix biocompatibility, as iPS cells rapidly attached to the surface of the material and proliferated. Strikingly though, heart DM presented a differentiation induction effect over those cells, which lost their pluripotency markers after 7 days of culture in the DM. Such loss of differentiation markers was observed, even though bFGF containing media mTSR was used during such period. Gene expression of iPS cells cultured on DM will be further analyzed, in order to assess the effects of culturing pluripotent stem cells in decellularized heart matrices.", "journal": "Journal of tissue science & engineering", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["Juliana LCarvalho", "Pablo Herthelde Carvalho", "Dawidson AGomes", "Alfredo MGoes"], "doi": "10.4172/2157-7552.S11-002"}

FGF signaling is transduced through FGF receptors 1-4, which have oncogenic or anti-oncogenic roles depending on the ligand and the cellular context. Our aim was to clarify the roles of FGFR1-3 in breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Pools of S115 mouse breast cancer cells expressing shRNA against FGFR1, 2 and 3 were created by lentiviral gene transfer, resulting in cells with downregulated expression of FGFR1, FGFR2 or FGFR3 (shR1, shR2 and shR3 cells, respectively) and shLacZ controls. FGFR1-silenced shR1 cells formed small, poorly vascularized tumors in nude mice. Silencing of FGFR2 in shR2 cells was associated with strong upregulation of FGFR1 expression and the formation of large, highly vascularized tumors compared to the control tumors. Silencing FGFR3 did not affect cell survival or tumor growth. Overexpressing FGFR2 in control cells did not affect FGFR1 expression, suggesting that high FGFR1 expression in shR2 cells and tumors was associated with FGFR2 silencing by indirect mechanisms. The expression of FGFR1 was, however, increased by the addition of FGF-8 to starved shLacZ or MCF-7 cells and decreased by the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in shR2 cells with an elevated FGFR1 level. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that FGFR1 is crucial for S115 breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth and angiogenesis, whereas FGFR2 and FGFR3 are less critical for the growth of these cells. The results also suggest that the expression of FGFR1 itself is regulated by FGF-8 and FGF signaling, which may be of importance in breast tumors expressing FGFs at a high level.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["Kati MTarkkonen", "Emeli MNilsson", "Tiina EK\u00e4hk\u00f6nen", "Julien HDey", "Jari EHeikkil\u00e4", "Johanna MTuomela", "QingLiu", "Nancy EHynes", "Pirkko LH\u00e4rk\u00f6nen"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0049970"}

{"title": "A computational model of neuro-glio-vascular loop interactions.", "abstract": "We present a computational, biophysical model of neuron-astrocyte-vessel interaction. Unlike other cells, neurons convey \"hunger\" signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron\u2192astrocyte\u2192vessel\u2192neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into ATP in the neuron. Neuronal ATP is used to drive the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [ATP] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the \"forward\" neuron\u2192vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of \"reverse\" influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["Bankim SubhashChander", "V SrinivasaChakravarthy"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0048802\n10.1152/physrev.00049.2005\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.024\n10.1038/nature09613\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600145\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.061\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.268101\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.02.004\n10.1007/s10827-008-0122-6\n10.1126/science.1359647\n10.1161/01.RES.80.6.877\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06003.x\n10.1038/sj.mn.7800146"}

Bioactive glass foam scaffolds are known to have osteogenic potential and suitable pore networks for bone regeneration. Degradation of the scaffolds is known to be initially solution mediated, but for effective bone regeneration, remodelling of the scaffold by osteoclasts and vascularisation of the scaffold is necessary. The culture of C7 macrophages on a bioactive glass scaffold induces the cells to differentiate into (TRAP(+ve) ) osteoclasts.

Although there was a temporary decline at 2 weeks, the stiffness and maximum tensile load of the experimental group was significantly greater than that of the control group at 4 and 8 weeks (P<0.01).

KLF10(-/-) mice also displayed impaired blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia. However, the mechanism of KLF10 induced angiogenesis is still not well understood. From ChIP-chip, which have been adopt to elucidate the novel target genes and signaling cascades of KLF10, COX-1 (also named as PTGS1) is one of the target genes that may be regulated by Klf10 through promoter binding. In order to investigate the function of KLF10/COX-1 axis, promoter activity, EMSA, ChIP-PCR and tube formation assays were serially performed. Our results demonstrated that KLF10 acts as a transcriptional activator on COX-1 promoter where overexpression of KLF10 induces COX-1 protein expression and mRNA expression in endothelial cells. It has been known that COX-1 is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis which regulated angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Using tube formation assay, we further demonstrated that KLF10 overexpressed endothelial cells formed better organized three-dimensional tube structure in contrast to the control group did. To specifically investigate the role for KLF10 in angiogenesis, the its deficient mice exhibited decreased light transmission which represents the extend of platelet aggregation slowing down.

{"title": "[\"Vicious circles\" of glioblastoma tumors: vascularization and invasiveness].", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and a particularly aggressive form of glial primary brain tumors. This malignancy accounts for ca. 70% of all diagnosed cases. Unfortunately, average survival of glioma patients does not exceed one year from diagnosis. Specific vascularization pattern (presence of numerous microvessels and glomerular vessels) and exceptional invasiveness are characteristic features of glioblastoma tumors. Both of these features reflect complex underlying processes forming two vicious circles. Common to both of these circles is the state of tumor underoxygenation. Hypoxia that occurs in the vicinity of abnormal tumor blood vessels stimulates formation of novel microvessels and invasiveness of tumor cells. In their essence, both of the vicious circles are processes allowing tumor cells to adapt to an underoxygenated tumor milieu. These processes play an important role in tumor progression, which reflects a specific type of evolution of cancer cells. Late effects of this evolution include appearance of highly aggressive, chemo- and radiotherapy resistant neoplastic cells. Increased adaptation capabilities of such cancer cells have a negative influence on the therapeutic process. Effective therapeutic strategies should not be directed against single cancer cell markers; instead, they should be targeted so as to break both vicious cycles. Herein we discuss several such strategies. In our opinion, effective therapeutic approaches must include a combination of several agents that recognize and simultaneously break both vicious cycles, i.e. vascularization and invasiveness. Also, agents that decrease hypoxia in cancer cells, for example drugs inhibiting activity of HIF-1\u03b1, might also prove therapeutically effective in such approaches.\u00a0", "journal": "Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online)", "date": "2012-11-24", "authors": ["Stanis\u0142awSzala", "MagdalenaJarosz", "RyszardSmolarczyk", "TomaszCicho\u0144"], "doi": "10.5604/17322693.1019657"}
{"title": "How to deal with dialysis catheters in the ICU setting.", "abstract": "Acute kidney insufficiency (AKI) occurs frequently in intensive care units (ICU). In the management of vascular access for renal replacement therapy (RRT), several factors need to be taken into consideration to achieve an optimal RRT dose and to limit complications. In the medium and long term, some individuals may become chronic dialysis patients and so preserving the vascular network is of major importance. Few studies have focused on the use of dialysis catheters (DC) in ICUs, and clinical practice is driven by the knowledge and management of long-term dialysis catheter in chronic dialysis patients and of central venous catheter in ICU patients. This review describes the appropriate use and management of DCs required to obtain an accurate RRT dose and to reduce mechanical and infectious complications in the ICU setting. To deliver the best RRT dose, the length and diameter of the catheter need to be sufficient. In patients on intermittent hemodialysis, the right internal jugular insertion is associated with a higher delivered dialysis dose if the prescribed extracorporeal blood flow is higher than 200 ml/min. To prevent DC colonization, the physician has to be vigilant for the jugular position when BMI < 24 and the femoral position when BMI > 28. Subclavian sites should be excluded. Ultrasound guidance should be used especially in jugular sites. Antibiotic-impregnated dialysis catheters and antibiotic locks are not recommended in routine practice. The efficacy of ethanol and citrate locks has yet to be demonstrated.

{"title": "Design and characterization of a tissue-engineered bilayer scaffold for osteochondral tissue repair.", "abstract": "Treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects relies on osteochondral bilayer grafts, which mimic the microenvironment and structure of the two affected tissues: articular cartilage and subchondral bone. However, the integrity and stability of the grafts are hampered by the presence of a weak interphase, generated by the layering processes of scaffold manufacturing. We describe here the design and development of a bilayer monolithic osteochondral graft, avoiding delamination of the two distinct layers but preserving the cues for selective generation of cartilage and bone. A highly porous polycaprolactone-based graft was obtained by combining solvent casting/particulate leaching techniques. Pore structure and interconnections were designed to favour in vivo vascularization only at the bony layer. Hydroxyapatite granules were added as bioactive signals at the site of bone regeneration. Unconfined compressive tests displayed optimal elastic properties and low residual deformation of the graft after unloading (< 3%). The structural integrity of the graft was successfully validated by tension fracture tests, revealing high resistance to delamination, since fractures were never displayed at the interface of the layers (n\u2009=\u20098). Ectopic implantation of grafts in nude mice, after seeding with bovine trabecular bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bovine articular chondrocytes, resulted in thick areas of mature bone surrounding ceramic granules within the bony layer, and a cartilaginous alcianophilic matrix in the chondral layer. Vascularization was mostly observed in the bony layer, with a statistically significant higher blood vessel density and mean area. Thus, the easily generated osteochondral scaffolds, since they are mechanically and biologically functional, are suitable for tissue-engineering applications for cartilage repair.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-11-23", "authors": ["PaoloGiannoni", "EricaLazzarini", "LucaCeseracciu", "Alberto CBarone", "RodolfoQuarto", "SilviaScaglione"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1651"}

Active remodeling of these layers was evident in the explants, as indicated by vascularization of the walls, invasion of the host cells, and the formation of a luminal endothelial layer on the TEHV leaflets.\nThis direct comparison of trans-apical and conventional surgical implantation techniques showed that crimping had no adverse effect on the integrity or functional outcome of TEHVs.

Among the Fatp family members, we observed that only Fatp1 and 4 are expressed in the control retina, in both the neuroretina and the retinal pigment epithelium. In the neuroretina, Fatp1 is mostly expressed in photoreceptors. In young adult Fatp1(-/-) mice, Fatp4 expression was unchanged in retinal pigment epithelium and reduced two-fold in the neuroretina as compared to Fatp1(+/+) mice. The Fatp1(-/-) mice had a preserved retinal structure but a decreased electroretinogram response to light. These mice also displayed a delayed recovery of the b-wave amplitude after bleaching, however, visual cycle speed was unchanged, and both retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors presented the same fatty acid pattern compared to controls. In 2 year-old Fatp1(-/-) mice, transmission electron microscopy studies showed specific abnormalities in the retinas comprising choroid vascularization anomalies and thickening of the Bruch membrane with material deposits, and sometimes local disorganization of the photoreceptor outer segments. These anomalies lead us to speculate that the absence of FATP1 accelerates the aging process.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-11-21", "authors": ["KarimChekroud", "LaurentGuillou", "StephaneGr\u00e9goire", "GillesDucharme", "EmilieBrun", "ChantalCazevieille", "LionelBretillon", "Christian PHamel", "PhilippeBrabet", "Marie OPequignot"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0050231"}
{"title": "Review of vascularised bone tissue-engineering strategies with a focus on co-culture systems.", "abstract": "Poor angiogenesis within tissue-engineered grafts has been identified as a main challenge limiting the clinical introduction of bone tissue-engineering (BTE) approaches for the repair of large bone defects. Thick BTE grafts often exhibit poor cellular viability particularly at the core, leading to graft failure and lack of integration with host tissues. Various BTE approaches have been explored for improving vascularisation in tissue-engineered constructs and are briefly discussed in this review. Recent investigations relating to co-culture systems of endothelial and osteoblast-like cells have shown evidence of BTE efficacy in increasing vascularization in thick constructs. This review provides an overview of key concepts related to bone formation and then focuses on the current state of engineered vascularized co-culture systems using bone repair as a model. It will also address key questions regarding the generation of clinically relevant vascularized bone constructs as well as potential directions and considerations for research with the objective of pursuing engineered co-culture systems in other disciplines of vascularized regenerative medicine. The final objective is to generate serious and functional long-lasting vessels for sustainable angiogenesis that will enable enhanced cellular survival within thick voluminous bone grafts, thereby aiding in bone formation and remodelling in the long term. However, more evidence about the quality of blood vessels formed and its associated functional improvement in bone formation as well as a mechanistic understanding of their interactions are necessary for designing better therapeutic strategies for translation to clinical settings.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-11-21", "authors": ["YuchunLiu", "Jerry K YChan", "Swee-HinTeoh"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1617"}

Our aim was to present a radical approach for correction of penile deformities as well as urethral reconstruction in patients after failed epispadias repair.\nBetween January 2006 and January 2011, 13 patients, aged 13 to 22 years, underwent redo surgery due to failed epispadias repair in childhood. All patients presented with severe dorsal curvature and short urethra. First stage included penile disassembly technique with complete separation of corporal bodies, urethral dissection, and transposition and subtotal glans mobilization. Residual dorsal curvature was corrected by tunical incision and grafting of the defect. Short urethra was dissected and transposed ventrally with opening at the base of the penis. Penile entities were reassembled in normal anatomical relationship. Penile body was covered using available vascularized skin flaps. After 6 months, second stage was performed and included reconstruction of the penile urethra using buccal mucosa graft and scrotal hairless skin flap.\nFollow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months (mean 33 months). Acceptable outcome is achieved in all the patients. Complete penile lengthening and straightening is obtained in 10 out of 13 patients. Mild curvature is noted in three patients without consequences. Satisfactory sexual activity was reported from nine patients. One patient developed fistula that was closed after 4 months, whereas all other patients reported normal voiding with no difficulties.\nRedo surgery of failed epispadias is very demanding procedure.

To investigate the genetic regulation of the terminating phase of liver regeneration, we performed a 60% PHx in a porcine model. Liver biopsies were taken at the time of resection, after three weeks and upon termination the sixth week. Gene expression profiles were obtained using porcine oligonucleotide microarrays. Our study reveals the interactions between genes regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis, and the role of Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signalling towards the end of liver regeneration.\nMicroarray analysis revealed a dominance of genes regulating apoptosis towards the end of regeneration. Caspase Recruitment Domain-Containing Protein 11 (CARD11) was up-regulated six weeks after PHx, suggesting the involvement of the caspase system at this time. Zinc Finger Protein (ZNF490) gene, with a potential negative effect on cell cycle progression, was only up-regulated at three and six weeks after PHx indicating a central role at this time. TGF-\u03b2 regulation was not found to be significantly affected in the terminating phase of liver regeneration. Vasohibin 2 (VASH2) was down-regulated towards the end of regeneration, and may indicate a role in preventing a continued vascularization process.\nCARD11, ZNF490 and VASH2 are differentially expressed in the termination phase of liver regeneration.

Using an original in vitro model, we showed that seizures were sufficient to activate the VEGF/VEGF-R2 system, which promotes vascularization and tight junction disassembly.

Case 1 involved an 85-year-old woman who visited our clinic with a complaint of blurred vision in her right eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was hand motion. Her right eye showed a submacular hemorrhage with retinal macroaneurysm. Prone positioning was difficult because of the patient's age and obesity. The treatment method was pneumatic displacement with 40-degree downward gaze positioning after intravitreal injection of 100% sulfur hexafluoride gas. After the treatment, the hemorrhage moved downward and BCVA of her right eye was 0.1. Case 2 involved a 58-year-old man with a complaint of blurred vision in his left eye. BCVA of his left eye was 0.3 and submacular hemorrhage was observed. He underwent displacement of the hemorrhage as previously described. After treatment, the submacular hemorrhage moved downward. Angiography detected a polypoidal lesion with a vascular network. upon diagnosis of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, bevacizumab was injected intravitreally. Two months after gas injection, the submacular hemorrhage disappeared. Optical coherence tomography showed flattening of the submacular retinal pigment epithelium, which was not observed prior to bevacizumab therapy. BCVA of the patient's left eye was 0.9.

In contrast, Egr-1 overexpression appeared to make tumour cells more susceptible to GD-induced necrosis. Finally, Egr-1 shRNA suppressed the growth of MTSs.

{"title": "Endothelial NO synthase augments fetoplacental blood flow, placental vascularization, and fetal growth in mice.", "abstract": "It is not known whether eNOS deficiency in the mother or the conceptus (ie, placenta and fetus) causes fetal growth restriction in mice lacking the endothelial NO synthase gene (eNOS knockout [KO]). We hypothesized that eNOS sustains fetal growth by maintaining low fetoplacental vascular tone and promoting fetoplacental vascularity and that this is a conceptus effect and is independent of maternal genotype. We found that eNOS deficiency blunted fetal growth, and blunted the normal increase in umbilical blood flow and umbilical venous diameter and the decrease in umbilical arterial Resistance Index in late gestation (14.5-17.5 days) in eNOS KO relative to C57Bl/6J controls. On day 17.5, fetoplacental capillary lobule length and capillary density in vascular corrosion casts were reduced in eNOS KO placentas. Reduced vascularization may be a result of decreased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein expression in eNOS KO placentas at this stage. These factors, combined with significant anemia found in eNOS KO fetuses, would be anticipated to reduce fetal oxygen delivery and contribute to the fetal tissue hypoxia that was detected in the heart, lung, kidney, and liver by immunohistochemistry using pimonidazole. Although maternal eNOS deficiency impairs uteroplacental adaptations to pregnancy, maternal genotype was not a significant factor affecting growth in heterozygous conceptuses. This indicates that fetal growth restriction was primarily caused by conceptus eNOS deficiency. In mice, placental hemodynamic and vascular changes with gestation and growth restriction showed strong parallels with human pregnancy. Thus, the eNOS KO model could provide insights into the pathogenesis of human intrauterine growth restriction.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2012-11-15", "authors": ["ShathiyahKulandavelu", "Kathie JWhiteley", "Shannon ABainbridge", "DaweiQu", "S LeeAdamson"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.201996"}

Furthermore, an extensive bilateral congenital cleft lip and cleft alveolar ridge with oblique facial cleft extending into the left medial canthal region, coloboma(s) of the left eyelids, extensive adhesions between lids and eye bulb, as well as circumferential grooves, clubfeet, and terminal transverse defects in both hands and feet were present. Due to severe progression of eye bulb protrusion with thinning of the sclera, enucleation of the left eye was performed at the age of 3 years in order to prevent complications including perforation of the globe and with the aim of improving cosmetic aspects.\nHistopathological examination of the enucleated eye disclosed findings typical of congenital anterior staphyloma, including massive corneal staphylomatic deformation with superficial vascularization and elapsed corneoscleral margin, destruction of Bowman's layer, absence of Descemet's layer, corneal endothelium, and angle structures. The lens was only partially formed, and had mainly dissolved. The neural retina appeared normal. The optic nerve disc revealed a pronounced excavation. Facial clefts, lid colobomas, congenital constriction bands, and amputation of distal limbs match ABS. This malformation complex develops in early pregnancy, probably prior to 35 days post conception.\nThis is the first report on an association of these two rare complex congenital malformations, congenital anterior staphyloma and amniotic band syndrome. The anterior staphyloma was unilateral, and related to facial clefts and lid coloboma in the area adjacent to the anterior staphyloma.

Furthermore, heart and body weights of examined animals were recorded and echocardiographic analysis of cardiac function as well as telemetric blood pressure measurements were performed. Moreover, gene expression, sarcomere shortening and calcium transients were examined in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from both genotypes. KO mice exhibited an accelerated body weight gain and a reduced heart to body weight ratio as compared to WT mice in the postnatal period. However, in adult KO mice the heart to body weight ratio was significantly increased most likely due to elevated systemic blood pressure. At postnatal day 7 ventricular capillarization index and the density of \u03b1-smooth muscle cell actin-positive blood vessels were higher in KO mice as compared to WT mice but normalized during adolescence. Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac systolic function at postnatal day 7 revealed decreased contractility of KO hearts in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, cardiomyocytes from KO mice showed a decreased sarcomere shortening and an increased peak Ca(2+) transient in response to isoprenaline when stimulated concomitantly with angiotensin II.\nThe AT2 receptor affects postnatal cardiac growth possibly via reducing body weight gain and systemic blood pressure.

Preclinical tumor models support a role for sprouting angiogenesis, vascular co-option and myeloid cell-derived angiogenesis in glioma vascularization, whereas a role for the other four mechanisms remains controversial and rather enigmatic. The anti-angiogenesis drug Avastin (Bevacizumab), which targets VEGF, has become one of the most popular cancer drugs in the world. Anti-angiogenic therapy may lead to vascular normalization and as such facilitate conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The mechanisms underlying pathological neovascularization in the retina remain incompletely understood. PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular metabolism. In skeletal muscle, PGC-1\u03b1 induces VEGFA expression and powerfully promotes angiogenesis, suggesting a similar role in other tissues. This study investigates the role of PGC-1\u03b1 during normal and pathological vascularization in the retina. We show that PGC-1\u03b1 induces the expression of VEGFA in numerous retinal cells, and that PGC-1\u03b1 expression is strongly induced during postnatal retinal development, coincident with VEGFA expression and angiogenesis. PGC-1\u03b1(-/-) mice have a significant reduction of early retinal vascular outgrowth, and reduced density of capillaries and number of main\u00a0arteries and veins as adults. In the oxygen-induced retinopathy model of retinopathy of prematurity, PGC-1\u03b1 expression is dramatically induced in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, suggesting that\u00a0PGC-1\u03b1 drives pathological neovascularization. In support of this, PGC-1\u03b1(-/-) mice subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy had decreased expression of VEGFA and were protected against pathological neovascularization. These results demonstrate that PGC-1\u03b1 regulates VEGFA in the retina and is\u00a0required for normal vessel development and for pathological neovascularization.

{"title": "Recurrent varicose veins of the legs. Analysis of a social problem.", "abstract": "The present study was aimed at assessing the experience of a single referral center with recurrent varicose veins of the legs (RVL) over the period 1993-2008. Among a total of 846 procedures for Leg Varices (LV), 74 procedures were for RVL (8.7%). The causes of recurrence were classified as classic: insufficient crossectomy (13); incompetent perforating veins (13); reticular phlebectasia (22); small saphenous vein insufficiency (9); accessory saphenous veins (4); and particular: post-hemodynamic treatment (5); incomplete stripping (1); Sapheno-Femoral Junction (SFJ) vascularization (5); post-thermal ablation (2). For the \"classic\" RVL the treatment consisted essentially of completing the previous treatment, both if the problem was linked to an insufficient earlier treatment and if it was due to a later onset. The most common cause in our series was reticular phlebectasia; when the simple sclerosing injections are not sufficient, this was treated by phlebectomy according to Mueller. The \"particular\" cases classified as 1, 2 and 4 were also treated by completing the traditional stripping procedure (+ crossectomy if this had not been done previously), considered to be the gold standard. In the presence of a SFJ neo-vascularization, with or without cavernoma, approximately 5 cm of femoral vein were explored, the afferent vessels ligated and, if cavernoma was present, it was removed. Although inguinal neo-angiogenesis is a possible mechanism, some doubt can be raised as to its importance as a primary factor in causing recurrent varicose veins, rather than their being due to a preexisting vein left in situ because it was ignored, regarded as insignificant, or poorly evident. In conclusion, we stress that LV is a progressive disease, so the treatment is unlikely to be confined to a single procedure. It is important to plan adequate monitoring during follow-up, and to be ready to reoperate when new problems present that, if left, could lead the patient to doubt the validity and efficacy of the original treatment.", "journal": "Il Giornale di chirurgia", "date": "2012-11-13", "authors": ["GCardia", "GCatalano", "IRosafio", "MGranatiero", "MDe Fazio"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Injectable hydrogel therapies and their delivery strategies for treating myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) impacts millions of people each year in the US. The field of tissue engineering has developed several potential therapies for treating MI including injectable acellular hydrogels. These injectable biomaterials can either be synthetic or naturally derived, and have the potential to be delivered minimally invasively.\nThis review covers the different methods of delivery and presents the initial work on the use of injectable biomaterial scaffolds alone to improve cardiac function post-MI. Several naturally derived materials including alginate, collagen, chitosan, decellularized tissues, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, keratin, and Matrigel, as well as a few synthetic materials have shown promise on their own without the addition of therapeutics such as cells or growth factors. These biomaterials can be potentially delivered via endocardial, epicardial, or intracoronary injections and some can even utilize current catheter technology, indicating a potential for avoiding invasive surgical procedures. Once injected into the wall of the heart, these hydrogels create a scaffold that provides biochemical and structural cues, and the ability for cellular infiltration and remodeling of the local environment.\nInjectable biomaterials have several crucial challenges that should be over come to design optimal therapies for MI and heart failure, including optimizing material properties, methods of injection and understanding the mechanisms of action. But, studies in both small and large animals have shown significant improvement in important parameters including wall thickness, vascularization of the ischemic region, left ventricular volumes, and cardiac function. Thus, the application of injectable biomaterials shows promise for developing into new therapies to treat MI, potentially improving millions of lives.", "journal": "Expert opinion on drug delivery", "date": "2012-11-13", "authors": ["Todd DJohnson", "Karen LChristman"], "doi": "10.1517/17425247.2013.739156"}

A total of 18 Sprague-Dawley albino rats were used in this experiment. The experimental groups each consisted of 6 rats and were treated as follows: group I, control; group II, I/R; group III, rotenone + I/R. In the control group, the rat bladders were removed by lower abdominal incision without any procedure. In the I/R group, 1 h prior to the ischemia 1 cc physiological serum was administered and the abdominal aortas were clamped for 1 h to achieve bladder ischemia. Following the ischemia, reperfusion was induced for 1 h and the bladders were removed. In the rotenone + I/R group, the rats were treated with 25 mg/kg rotenone intraperitoneally. The iNOS and COX-2 mRNA levels in each group were detected using RT-PCR. In the I/R group, the COX-2 levels in the bladder tissue were higher compared with the control group (P<0.05). The COX-2 levels in the rotenone-treated group were statistically lower compared with the I/R group (P<0.01). Vascularization and edema were markedly increased in the I/R group. Following rotenone treatment these were abrogated inversely to inflammation. Although iNOS levels were slightly higher in the I/R group compared with the control group, iNOS levels did not decrease and no significant difference was observed between the groups with regard to rotenone treatment (P>0.05).

However, besides VEGF-A, other proteins of the same family, including VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF, all together VEGFs), have a crucial role in the angiogenesis process. PlGF and VEGF, which form heterodimers if co-expressed, both are required for pathologic angiogenesis. We generated a PlGF1 variant, named PlGF1-DE, which is unable to bind and activate VEGFR-1, but retains the ability to form heterodimer. PlGF1-DE acts as dominant negative of VEGF-A and PlGF1wt through heterodimerization mechanism. The purpose of our study was to explore the therapeutic potential of Plgf1-de gene in choroid and cornea NV context.\nIn the model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), Plgf1-de gene, and as control Plgf1wt, LacZ, or gfp genes, were delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector by subretinal injection 14 days before the injury. After 7 days CNV volume was assessed. Corneal NV was induced by scrape or suture procedures. Expression vectors for PlGF1wt or PlGF1-DE, and as control the empty vector pCDNA3, were injected in the mouse cornea after the vascularization insults. NV was evaluated with CD31 and LYVE-1 immunostaining.\nThe expression of Plgf1-de induced significant inhibition of choroidal and corneal NV by reducing VEGF-A homodimer production. Conversely, the delivery of Plgf1wt, despite induced similar reduction of VEGF-A production, did not affect NV.\nPlgf1-de gene is a new therapeutic tool for the inhibition of VEGFs driven ocular NV.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2012-11-10", "authors": ["ValeriaTarallo", "SashaBogdanovich", "YoshioHirano", "LauraTudisco", "LorenaZentilin", "MauroGiacca", "JayakrishnaAmbati", "SandroDe Falco"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.12-10658"}

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a medial and intraconal rounded mass that perfused slowly and whose anterior surface was well circumscribed. At surgery, the tumor was solid and pink with intersecting white bands and densely attached to surrounding normal tissues. The most adherent apical portion of the mass was left behind after subtotal excision. Histopathologically, only a partial pseudocapsule was discovered. The tumor was composed of cavernous channels, capillary zones, compressed lumens with linear strands of endothelium, and collections of muscular veins devoid of an elastica. Striking smooth muscle actin positivity was identified in disorganized masses of smooth muscle cells in the intervascular spaces and around the cavernous vascular units; these myocytes were intermixed with bundles of interstitial keloidal collagen. The endothelium was CD31 and CD34 positive for vascular endothelium and D2-40 negative for lymphatic endothelium.\nThe authors have classified this hybrid tumor an angiomyofibroma with low neoplastic potential and features of a malformation. It is a composite variant of cavernous hemangioma associated with a conspicuous proliferation of anomalous disorganized smooth muscle cells (leiomyoma). Most of the lesion lacked a pseudocapsule, which impeded surgical delivery. Incomplete excision is recommended in such cases as preferable to the complications that could ensue from overly aggressive efforts at complete removal, particularly at the orbital apex.

{"title": "Tanshinone IIA inhibits metastasis after palliative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma and prolongs survival in part via vascular normalization.", "abstract": "Promotion of endothelial normalization restores tumor oxygenation and obstructs tumor cells invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. We therefore investigated whether a vasoactive drug, tanshinone IIA, could inhibit metastasis by inducing vascular normalization after palliative resection (PR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nA liver orthotopic double-tumor xenograft model in nude mouse was established by implantation of HCCLM3 (high metastatic potential) and HepG2 tumor cells. After removal of one tumor by PR, the effects of tanshinone IIA administration on metastasis, tumor vascularization, and survival were evaluated. Tube formation was examined in mouse tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) treated with tanshinone IIA.\nPR significantly accelerated residual hepatoma metastases. Tanshinone IIA did not inhibit growth of single-xenotransplanted tumors, but it did reduce the occurrence of metastases. Moreover, it inhibited PR-enhanced metastases and, more importantly, prolonged host survival. Tanshinone IIA alleviated residual tumor hypoxia and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vivo; however, it did not downregulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) or reverse EMT of tumor cells under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Tanshinone IIA directly strengthened tube formation of TECs, associated with vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor 1/platelet derived growth factor receptor (VEGFR1/PDGFR) upregulation. Although the microvessel density (MVD) of residual tumor tissue increased after PR, the microvessel integrity (MVI) was still low. While tanshinone IIA did not inhibit MVD, it did dramatically increase MVI, leading to vascular normalization.\nOur results demonstrate that tanshinone IIA can inhibit the enhanced HCC metastasis associated with PR.

The composite patch group was also associated with significantly less fibrosis and more vessels in the infarct area. However, although human progenitors expressing cardiac markers were present in the patches before implantation, none of them could be subsequently identified in the grafted tissue.

The reconstructions were performed with implantation of a free, non-vascularized iliac crest bone graft (4), osteosynthesis with implantation of a pedicled vascularized bone graft (3) and osteosynthesis with cancellous bone graft (1). The mean range of motion of the wrist was extension/flexion 111.3\u00b0. The average grip strength by JAMAR dynamometer showed right versus left sight 32.7 kg (\u00b13.5) versus 33.7 (\u00b12.9). The evaluation of the DASH score resulted in 11.6 (\u00b112.5), the SF36 scale in 87.1 (\u00b19.2) points. The present case series for the first time demonstrated functional mid-term results of the rare event of bilateral scaphoid reconstruction after non-union.

Treating difficult-to-heal wounds with complexities, including those with exposed tendon/bone or infection, is a challenge that regularly confronts practitioners in a variety of clinical environments. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness of an acellular fetal bovine dermal repair scaffold (PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold, TEI Biosciences, Inc, Boston, MA) used to treat complex difficult-to-heal wounds presenting in the authors' practice.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted of a single practice with multiple practicing physicians between 2008 and 2010. Over this time period, 70 patients with 83 wounds were treated with the acellular fetal bovine dermis following surgical debridement of the wound. Forty-nine patients (58 wounds) met established inclusion/exclusioncriteria and were critically evaluated.\nWounds treated with the acellular fetal bovine dermis included chronic diabetic wounds, venous wounds, and pressure ulcers, as well as wounds caused by trauma and surgery. Additionally, the patients treated had comorbidities commonly associated with recalcitrant wounds. Of the wounds evaluated in this study, 75.9% successfully healed; 63.8% reepithelialized, and 12.1% were closed with a skin graft subsequent to treatment. Notably, the majority (58.6%) of the wounds reepithelialized by 12 weeks following a single application of the dermal repair scaffold. In the subset of challenging wounds with exposed tendon/bone, 80.8% of the wounds were treated successfully (61.5% reepithelialized, and 19.3% were skin grafted), indicating the successful regeneration and reepithelialization of new vascularized tissue by fetal dermal collagen in relatively avascular wound defects.\nThe acellular fetal bovine dermal repair scaffold can be used as part of an effective treatment regimen to heal complex wounds with exposed tendon/bone caused by varying etiologies. The product actively participates in the generation of a new, vascularized tissue capable of reepithelializing, or successfully supporting, a split-thickness skin graft in defects where initial grafting or living skin substitutes are not viable options. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff.", "journal": "Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice", "date": "2012-11-01", "authors": ["Neil HStrauss", "Richard JBrietstein"], "doi": null}

Chest radiograph showed a 5.5 cm well-defined mass in the left upper lung field. CT revealed a well-circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.0 cm with a lobulated margin in the left upper lobe.

{"title": "Resolvin D2 prevents secondary thrombosis and necrosis in a mouse burn wound model.", "abstract": "Deep partial thickness burns are subject to delayed necrosis of initially viable tissues surrounding the primary zone of thermally induced coagulation, which results in an expansion of the burn wound, both in area and depth, within 48 hours postburn. Neutrophil sequestration and activation leading to microvascular damage is thought to mediate this secondary tissue damage. Resolvins, a class of endogenous mediators derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to regulate the resolution of inflammation. We hypothesized that exogenous resolvins could mitigate the deleterious impact of the inflammatory response in burn wounds. Using two different mouse burn injury models involving significant partial thickness injuries, we found that a systemically administered single dose of resolvin D2 (RvD2) as low as 25\u2009pg/g bw given within an interval of up to 4 hours postburn effectively prevented thrombosis of the deep dermal vascular network and subsequent dermal necrosis. By preserving the microvascular network, RvD2 enhanced neutrophil access to the dermis, but prevented neutrophil-mediated damage through other anti-inflammatory actions, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and neutrophil platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1.

{"title": "Vitamin MK-7 enhances vitamin D3-induced osteogenesis in hMSCs: modulation of key effectors in mineralization and vascularization.", "abstract": "The osteoblast is the bone-forming cell and is derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Osteo-inductive substances could represent a useful therapeutic approach during the fracture repair process. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of vitamin MK-7, alone or in association with vitamin D3, in differentiating human MSCs (hMSCs) in vitro along the osteoblastic lineage. In particular, primary endpoints of the study include gene and protein markers of osteoblast differentiation. Considering genes involved in bone formation and mineralization, our data show that vitamin MK-7 enhances vitamin D3 gene induction of osteocalcin (OC). Among genes related to cell growth and differentiation, a specific effect of vitamin MK-7 was observed for growth differentiation factor-10 (GDF10) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), the latter being also involved in the induction of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFA). Accordingly, vitamin co-supplementation greatly affected VEGFA and its receptor fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), a key factor in both angiogenic and osteogenic processes. These results stress the relevance of MK-7 and D3 co-supplementation in the bone-healing process as able to modulate the expression of genes involved in both mineralization and angiogenesis. Moreover, at the protein level co-association of vitamins might provide an optimal balance between induction and carboxylation of osteocalcin, essential for its functionality in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Our results may provide hints for therapeutic application of hMSCs in bone disease, clarifying mechanisms involved in stem cell-mediated bone development, and they also highlight the relevance of co-supplementation strategies, since single supplementations might result in a suboptimal effect.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-10-31", "authors": ["AGigante", "FBrug\u00e8", "SCecconi", "SManzotti", "G PLittarru", "LTiano"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1627"}

{"title": "A unique galectin signature in human prostate cancer progression suggests galectin-1 as a key target for treatment of advanced disease.", "abstract": "Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, influence tumor progression by modulating interactions between tumor, endothelial, stromal, and immune cells. Despite considerable progress in identifying the roles of individual galectins in tumor biology, an integrated portrait of the galectin network in different tumor microenvironments is still missing. We undertook this study to analyze the \"galectin signature\" of the human prostate cancer microenvironment with the overarching goal of selecting novel-molecular targets for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. In examining androgen-responsive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and primary tumors representing different stages of the disease, we found that galectin-1 (Gal-1) was the most abundantly expressed galectin in prostate cancer tissue and was markedly upregulated during disease progression. In contrast, all other galectins were expressed at lower levels: Gal-3, -4, -9, and -12 were downregulated during disease evolution, whereas expression of Gal-8 was unchanged. Given the prominent regulation of Gal-1 during prostate cancer progression and its predominant localization at the tumor-vascular interface, we analyzed the potential role of this endogenous lectin in prostate cancer angiogenesis. In human prostate cancer tissue arrays, Gal-1 expression correlated with the presence of blood vessels, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. Silencing Gal-1 in prostate cancer cells reduced tumor vascularization without altering expression of other angiogenesis-related genes. Collectively, our findings identify a dynamically regulated \"galectin-specific signature\" that accompanies disease evolution in prostate cancer, and they highlight a major role for Gal-1 as a tractable target for antiangiogenic therapy in advanced stages of the disease.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2012-10-31", "authors": ["Diego JLaderach", "Lucas DGentilini", "LauraGiribaldi", "Victor CardenasDelgado", "LorenaNugnes", "Diego OCroci", "NaderAl Nakouzi", "PaulaSacca", "GabrielCasas", "OsvaldoMazza", "Margaret AShipp", "ElbaVazquez", "AnneChauchereau", "Jeffery LKutok", "Scott JRodig", "Mar\u00eda TElola", "DanielCompagno", "Gabriel ARabinovich"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1260"}

Benign meningiomas, however, can erode through the nasal mucosa-the very same mucosa that is used to reconstruct the anterior cranial fossa floor. The goal of this study was to describe the presence of meningioma invasion into the mucosa in patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal resection of ventral skull base meningiomas. The implications of this finding are discussed with respect to resection, reconstruction, and recurrence.\nThis is a retrospective review of three patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal complete resection of ventral skull base meningiomas. Surgically excised tissues were processed for routine histopathological analysis.\nA complete resection of the bone, dura, and tumor was performed in all three cases.

Histopathological analysis demonstrated mucosal invasion by World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma in two of the three cases.\nVentral anterior skull base meningiomas can invade through bone into the mucosa. Because the endoscopic endonasal resection of these meningiomas often requires the use of a vascularized nasoseptal flap to minimize CSF leak complications, it is possible that the nasoseptal flap itself may be compromised by tumor tissue.

Here, we sandwiched stripe patterned endothelial cells by randomly cultured fibroblast sheets to control the formation of vasculature in the tissue. The endothelial cells left the original pattern and formed a random network between the two sheets, but, where fibroblasts were focally oriented, some endothelial cells changed their orientation to the same direction as the surrounding fibroblasts. Based on this phenomenon, we sandwiched stripe-patterned endothelial cells between parallel-oriented fibroblast sheets to construct a continuous pre-vascular structure. In the tissue, endothelial cells maintained the shape of their original pattern. On the other hand, stripe-patterned endothelial cells that were vertically sandwiched between oriented fibroblast sheets diverged from the original pattern at right angles, so that they were aligned with the surrounding fibroblasts.

The potential of vasculature formation within tissue-engineered grafts depends on various factors, including an appropriate choice of scaffold and its microarchitectural design for the support of tissue ingrowth and vessel infiltration, vasculogenic potential of cell types and mechanostimulation on cells to enhance cytokine expression. Here, we demonstrated the effect of biomechanical stimulation on vasculogenic and bone-forming capacity of umbilical-cord-blood endothelial progenitor cells (UCB-EPC) and human fetal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hfMSC) seeded within macroporous scaffolds and cocultured dynamically in a biaxial bioreactor. Dynamically cultured EPC/hfMSC constructs generated greater mineralization and calcium deposition consistently over 14 days of culture (1.7-fold on day 14; p<0.05). However, in vitro vessel formation was not observed as compared to an extensive EPC-vessel network formed under static culture on day 7. Subsequent subcutaneous implantations in NOD/SCID mice showed 1.4-fold higher human:mouse cell chimerism (p<0.001), with a more even cellular distribution throughout the dynamically cultured scaffolds. In addition, there was earlier evidence of vessel infiltration into the scaffold and a trend toward increased ectopic bone formation, suggesting improved efficacy and cellular survival through early vascularization upon biomechanical stimulation.

{"title": "Adrenomedullin gene dosage correlates with tumor and lymph node lymphangiogenesis.", "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (AM) is a potent lymphangiogenic factor that promotes lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) proliferation through a pharmacologically tractable G-protein-coupled receptor. Numerous types of human cancers have increased levels of AM; however, the functional consequences of this fact have not been characterized. Therefore, we evaluated whether modulating adrenomedullin (Adm) gene dosage within tumor cells affects lymphangiogenesis. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells that overexpress or underexpress Adm were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice, and tumors were evaluated for growth and vascularization. A dosage range from \u223c10 to 200% of wild-type Adm expression did not affect LLC proliferation in vitro or in vivo, nor did it affect angiogenesis. Notably, the dosage of Adm markedly and significantly influenced tumor lymphangiogenesis. Reduced Adm expression in tumors decreased the proliferation of LECs and the number of lymphatic vessels, while elevated tumor Adm expression led to enlarged lymphatic vessels. Moreover, overexpression of Adm in tumors induced sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis and led to an increased incidence of Ki67-positive foci within the lung. These data show that tumor-secreted AM is a critical factor for driving both tumor and lymph node lymphangiogenesis. Thus, pharmacological targeting of AM signaling may provide a new avenue for inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2012-10-27", "authors": ["Natalie OKarpinich", "Daniel OKechele", "Scott TEspenschied", "Helen HWillcockson", "YuriFedoriw", "Kathleen MCaron"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.12-214080"}

Quantitative three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonographic assessment of synovial vascularization was compared at each visit with serum levels of VEGF, angiogenin and TIMP-2.\nIn the glucocorticoid group, synovial Doppler signals decreased significantly at day 3 (-44%; P=0.003) in comparison to a delayed decrease in the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor group after 6 weeks (-46%; P=0.001). A significant reduction of serum VEGF levels could be determined with a delay of 1 week after the decrease of Doppler activity but no correlation was found between both parameters (rho: P=0.7; r=-0.03). Angiogenin concentrations decreased in the TNF group and increased in the GC group. Levels of TIMP-2 did not change significantly in both groups.\nThe decrease of serum VEGF levels under treatment with glucocorticoids or TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors followed the reduction of the intra-articular synovial Doppler flow.

{"title": "Scaffolds to promote spinal cord regeneration.", "abstract": "Substantial research effort in the spinal cord injury (SCI) field is directed towards reduction of secondary injury changes and enhancement of tissue sparing. However, pathway repair after complete transections, large lesions, or after chronic injury may require the implantation of some form of oriented bridging structure to restore tissue continuity across a trauma zone. These matrices or scaffolds should be biocompatible and create an environment that facilitates tissue growth and vascularization, and allow axons to regenerate through and beyond the implant in order to reconnect with \"normal\" tissue distal to the injury. The myelination of regrown axons is another important requirement. In this chapter, we describe recent advances in biomaterial technology designed to provide a terrain for regenerating axons to grow across the site of injury and/or create an environment for endogenous repair. Many different types of scaffold are under investigation; they can be biodegradable or nondegradable, natural or synthetic. Scaffolds can be designed to incorporate immobilized signaling molecules and/or used as devices for controlled release of therapeutic agents, including growth factors.

{"title": "Reconstruction of combined oral mucosa-mandibular defects using the vascularized myoosseous iliac crest free flap.", "abstract": "The authors present five cases of combined oral mucosa-mandible defects reconstructed with the vascularized internal oblique-iliac crest myoosseous free flap. This technique has many advantages compared to other conventional methods such as the radial flap, scapula flap, and fibula flap. Vascularized iliac crest flaps provide sufficient high-quality bone suitable for reconstructing segmental mandibular defects. Although fibular flaps allow longer donor bone tissue to be harvested, the iliac crest can provide an esthetic shape for mandibular body reconstruction and also provides sufficient bone height for dental implants. Conventional vascularized iliac crest myoosseous flaps have excessive soft tissue bulk for reconstruction of intraoral soft tissue defects. The modification discussed in the present article can reduce soft tissue volume, resulting in better functional reconstruction of the oral mucosa. Another advantage is that complete replacement of the oral mucosa is observed in as early as one month post-operation. The final mucosal texture is much better than that obtained with other skin paddle flaps, which is especially beneficial for the placement of dental implant prostheses. Donor site morbidity looks to be similar to, if not less than that observed for other modalities in terms of function and esthetics.

The \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) integrin, highly overexpressed on newly formed tumor vessels, has been successfully used as a target for Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-functionalized nanoparticle contrast agents. In the present study, an RGD-functionalized nanocarrier was used to image ongoing angiogenesis in two different xenograft tumor models with varying intensities of angiogenesis (LS174T > EW7). To that end, iron oxide nanocrystals were included in the core of the nanoparticles to provide contrast for T(2)*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas the fluorophore Cy7 was attached to the surface to enable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. The mouse tumor models were used to test the potential of the nanoparticle probe in combination with dual modality imaging for in vivo detection of tumor angiogenesis. Pre-contrast and post-contrast images (4 hours) were acquired at a 9.4-T MRI system and revealed significant differences in the nanoparticle accumulation patterns between the two tumor models. In the case of the highly vascularized LS174T tumors, the accumulation was more confined to the periphery of the tumors, where angiogenesis is predominantly occurring. NIRF imaging revealed significant differences in accumulation kinetics between the models.

The aim of this study was to present changes in the management of the wound of augmentation gluteoplasty with silicone implants in an attempt to reduce the rates of postoperative complications.\nTwenty female candidates for augmentation gluteoplasty were selected prospectively and submitted to the procedure with a modified technique. The incidence of wound complications was compared with the data of the authors and of the literature.\nIn the comparison between homogeneous groups of patients, the modified technique reduced the rate of wound complications from 35 percent to 5 percent. The most frequent complications were seroma and dehiscence. The combination of liposuction of the flanks was not a risk factor for the occurrence of these complications.\nReduction of the undermined subcutaneous area, application of adhesion stitches, and maintenance of good vascularization in the sacral region are the keystones of the authors' proposal.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified to be one of the most important factors of angiogenesis. VEGF-C, a novel member of the family, is a relatively specific lymphangiogenic growth factor. It is tempting to suggest that cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in a woman's life. Its prognostic factors are tumor stage, lymph node status, histologic type, level of hemoglobin. However, little is known about prognostic or/and predictive significance of angiogenesis in cervical cancer.\nThis prospective study is an attempt to evaluate serum VEGF-A, VEGF-C, microvessel density (MVD), and lymphatic vessel density (LMVD) in cervical cancer and the correlations with clinicopathologic features.\nBlood samples were collected from 58 patients affected by FIGO I-IV stage cervical cancer, who were admitted to the Department of Oncology and Brachytherapy Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz of Nicolaus Copernicus University. Serum VEGF-A/VEGF-C concentrate was determined by means of a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). All tumor samples were taken from cross section during the first brachytherapy. Then they were examined by immunohistochemical studies with podoplanin antibody and anti-CD31 antibody. The present analysis was used to evaluate MVD and LMVD.\nThe median serum VEGF-A was 734.76 pg/ml (range from 86.39 pg/ml - 2200.00 pg/ml), and VEGF-A was only correlated with after treatment hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.046, R = -0.3450). The median serum VEGF-C was 145.72 pg/ml (range 131.08 - 233.60 pg/ml). Serum VEGF-C levels measured in patients were associated with primary tumor size. We observed significantly higher serum VEGF-C in localized disease (FIGO I, II) in comparison to advanced tumors (232.44 pg/ml vs 152.45 pg/ml; p = 0.034). The median LMVD was 6.25 (range 3.5-10.0) and median blood vessel density was 12.5 (range 9.5-23.0).

{"title": "Generation of functional blood vessels from a single c-kit+ adult vascular endothelial stem cell.", "abstract": "In adults, the growth of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis, is essential for organ growth and repair. In many disorders including cancer, angiogenesis becomes excessive. The cellular origin of new vascular endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations has remained unknown. Here, we provide evidence for adult vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation within CD117+ (c-kit+) ECs capable of undergoing clonal expansion while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. Isolated VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells in vitro. A single transplanted c-kit-expressing VESC by the phenotype lin-CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host circulation. VESCs also have long-term self-renewal capacity, a defining functional property of adult stem cells. To provide functional verification on the role of c-kit in VESCs, we show that a genetic deficit in endothelial c-kit expression markedly decreases total colony-forming VESCs. In vivo, c-kit expression deficit resulted in impaired EC proliferation and angiogenesis and retardation of tumor growth. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization after ischemic events.

A tongue lesion that appears in a RCC patient should always be considered suspect and a multidisciplinary study should be conducted both to assess whether it is a metastasis or a primary new lesion and to understand which method should be selected, if necessary, to treat it (surgery, radiation or embolization).

However, the high thickness and low porosity of the membranes limited heterotypic cell-cell interactions, which are essential to form HSC-EC hybrid structures. Here, we focused on the effective use of the thin and highly porous poly( d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microporous membranes in SH-HSC-EC tri-culture to reconstruct the HSC-incorporated liver capillary structures in vitro. First, the formation of EC capillary-like structures was induced on Matrigel-coated PLGA microporous membranes. Next, the membranes were stacked on hepatic organoids composed of small SHs and HSCs. When the pore size and porosity of the membranes were optimized, HSCs selectively migrated to the EC capillary-like structures. This process was mediated in part by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling. In addition, the HSCs were located along the outer surface of the EC capillary-like structures with their long cytoplasmic processes. In the HSC-incorporated capillary tissues, SHs acquired high levels of differentiated functions, compared to those without ECs. This model will provide a basis for the construction of functional, thick, vascularized liver tissues in vitro.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-10-23", "authors": ["JunichiKasuya", "RyoSudo", "GentaMasuda", "ToshihiroMitaka", "MarikoIkeda", "KazuoTanishita"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1630"}

Producing tissues similar to immature kidneys from simple suspensions of fully dissociated embryonic renal cells is possible in vitro, but glomeruli do not form in the avascular environment. Here, we constructed renal organoids from single-cell suspensions derived from E11.5 kidneys and then implanted these organoids below the kidney capsule of a living rat host. This implantation resulted in further maturation of kidney tissue, formation of vascularized glomeruli with fully differentiated capillary walls, including the slit diaphragm, and appearance of erythropoietin-producing cells. The implanted tissue exhibited physiologic functions, including tubular reabsorption of macromolecules, that gained access to the tubular lumen on glomerular filtration. The ability to generate vascularized nephrons from single-cell suspensions marks a significant step to the long-term goal of replacing renal function by a tissue-engineered kidney.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2012-10-23", "authors": ["ChristodoulosXinaris", "ValentinaBenedetti", "PaolaRizzo", "MauroAbbate", "DanielaCorna", "NadiaAzzollini", "SaraConti", "MathieuUnbekandt", "Jamie ADavies", "MarinaMorigi", "ArielaBenigni", "GiuseppeRemuzzi"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2012050505"}

We investigated if these requirements can be met by providing an intrinsic vascularization stimulus (via sustained action of VEGF secreted at a controlled rate by transduced myoblasts) to a cardiac patch engineered under conditions of effective oxygen supply (via medium flow through channeled elastomeric scaffolds seeded with neonatal cardiomyocytes). We demonstrate that this combined approach resulted in increased viability, vascularization and functionality of the cardiac patch. After implantation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, VEGF-expressing patches displayed significantly improved engraftment, survival and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, leading to greatly enhanced contractility as compared to controls not expressing VEGF. Controlled VEGF expression also mediated the formation of mature vascular networks, both within the engineered patches and in the underlying ischemic myocardium. We propose that this combined cell-biomaterial approach can be a promising strategy to engineer cardiac patches with intrinsic and extrinsic vascularization potential.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-10-23", "authors": ["AnnaMarsano", "RobertMaidhof", "JianwenLuo", "KanaFujikara", "Elisa EKonofagou", "AndreaBanfi", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.038"}
{"title": "Comparison of methods for whole-organ decellularization in tissue engineering of bioartificial organs.", "abstract": "Organ transplantation is now a well-established procedure for the treatment of end-stage organ failure due to various causes, but is a victim of its own success in that there is a growing disparity in numbers between the donor organ pool available for transplantation and the patients eligible for such a procedure; hence, an alternative solution to the limited donor organ pool is both desirable and necessary. Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of functional replacement tissues for clinical use. A recent innovation in tissue and organ engineering is the technique of whole-organ decellularization, which allows the production of complex three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM) bioscaffolds of the entire organ with preservation of the intrinsic vascular network. These bioscaffolds can then be recellularized to create potentially functional organ constructs as a regenerative medicine strategy for organ replacement. We review the current applications and methods in using xenogeneic whole-organ ECM scaffolds to create potentially functional bioartificial organ constructs for surgical implantation, and present a comparison of specific trends within this new and developing technique.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Calcium-alginate hydrogel-encapsulated fibroblasts provide sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "Vascularization of engineered or damaged tissues is essential to maintain cell viability and proper tissue function. Revascularization of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart after myocardial infarction is particularly important, since hypoxia can give rise to chronic heart failure due to inappropriate remodeling of the LV after death of cardiomyocytes (CMs). Fibroblasts can express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which plays a major role in angiogenesis and also acts as a chemoattractant and survival factor for CMs and cardiac progenitors. In this in vitro model study, mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts encapsulated in 2% w/v Ca-alginate were shown to remain viable for 150 days. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that over 21 days of encapsulation, fibroblasts continued to express VEGF, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that there was sustained release of VEGF from the Ca-alginate during this period. The scaffold degraded gradually over the 21 days, without reduction in volume. Cells released from the Ca-alginate at 7 and 21 days as a result of scaffold degradation were shown to retain viability, to adhere to fibronectin in a normal manner, and continue to express VEGF, demonstrating their potential to further contribute to maintenance of cardiac function after scaffold degradation. This model in vitro study therefore demonstrates that fibroblasts encapsulated in Ca-alginate provide sustained release of VEGF.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "A comparison of Doppler optical coherence tomography methods.", "abstract": "We compare, in detail, the phase-resolved color Doppler (PRCD), phase-resolved Doppler variance (PRDV) and intensity-based Doppler variance (IBDV) methods. All the methods are able to quantify flow speed when the flow rate is within a certain range, which is dependent on the adjacent A-line time interval. While PRCD is most sensitive when the flow direction is along the probing beam, PRDV and IBDV can be used to measure the flow when the flow direction is near perpendicular to the probing beam. However, the values of PRDV and IBDV are Doppler angle-dependent when the Doppler angle is above a certain threshold. The sensitivity of all the methods can be improved by increasing the adjacent A-line time interval while still maintaining a high sampling density level. We also demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, high resolution inter-frame PRDV method. In applications where mapping vascular network such as angiogram is more important than flow velocity quantification, IBDV and PRDV images show better contrast than PRCD images. The IBDV and PRDV show very similar characteristics and demonstrate comparable results for vasculature mapping. However, the IBDV is less sensitive to bulk motion and with less post-processing steps, which is preferred for fast data processing situations. In vivo imaging of mouse brain with intact skull and human skin with the three methods were demonstrated and the results were compared.

Resveratrol and EGCG are two polyphenols with anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties that have been proposed as natural therapies to treat endometriosis.\nFifty-six 2-month-old female BALB/c mice underwent surgical induction of endometriosis. Treatments with resveratrol or EGCG started 15 days post-surgery and continued for 4 weeks. Human biopsies were taken with a metal Novak curette from the posterior uterine wall from 16 patients with untreated endometriosis and 15 controls who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for infertility.\nAfter the treatments, animals were sacrificed and lesions were counted, measured, excised and fixed. Immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CD34 was performed for cell proliferation and vascularization assessment in the lesions. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique was performed for apoptosis evaluation. Peritoneal fluid was collected to analyze vascular endothelial growth factor levels. Human EECs were purified from proliferative-phase endometrial biopsies and cultured. The effect of both polyphenols on cell proliferation was determined by a colorimetric assay using the CellTiter 96\u00aeAQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit and on apoptosis by the TUNEL technique, using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit with Fluorescein.\nIn the mouse model, both treatments significantly reduced the mean number (P < 0.05 versus control) and the volume of established lesions (P < 0.05 versus control). Treatments consistently statistically significantly diminished cell proliferation (resveratrol P < 0.01 and EGCG P < 0.05, versus control), reduced vascular density (resveratrol P < 0.01 and EGCG P < 0.001, versus control) and increased apoptosis within the lesions (resveratrol P < 0.01 and EGCG P < 0.05, versus control). Both compounds induced reduction in human EEC proliferation (P < 0.05 versus basal) and increased apoptosis (P < 0.05 versus basal) in primary cultures.\nIn vitro studies were only carried out in epithelial cells from human eutopic endometrium.\nThe present findings are promising and will assist the development of novel natural treatments for endometriosis.\nThis study was supported by ANPCYT (PICT 6384 BID 1201 OC-AR) and CONICET (PIP 5471), Argentina.

{"title": "The dual roles of homeobox genes in vascularization and wound healing.", "abstract": "Homeobox genes represent a family of highly conserved transcription factors originally discovered to regulate organ patterning during development. More recently, several homeobox genes were shown to affect processes in adult tissue, including angiogenesis and wound healing. Whereas a subset of members of the Hox-family of homeobox genes activate growth and migration to promote angiogenesis or wound healing, other Hox genes function to restore or maintain quiescent, differentiated tissue function. Pathological tissue remodeling is linked to differential expression of activating or stabilizing Hox genes and dysregulation of Hox expression can contribute to disease progression. Studies aimed at understanding the role and regulation of Hox genes have provided insight into how these potent morphoregulatory genes can be applied to enhance tissue engineering or limit cancer progression.", "journal": "Cell adhesion & migration", "date": "2012-10-19", "authors": ["SurajKachgal", "Kimberly AMace", "Nancy JBoudreau"], "doi": "10.4161/cam.22164\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1152/ajpheart.00787.2004\n10.1023/A:1006493130855\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80154-9\n10.1161/01.RES.85.3.221\n10.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.v18.i3.30\n10.1038/nm0195-27\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80108-7\n10.1038/nri2528\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e32831bed7e\n10.1023/A:1020304003704\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1278\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.034\n10.1084/jem.20081605\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603240\n10.1073/pnas.87.17.6624\n10.1126/science.7521539\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64488-4\n10.1055/s-0030-1253454\n10.1038/276565a0\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90290-9\n10.1016/S0070-2153(09)88009-5\n10.1038/359835a0\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90810-2\n10.1038/35057062\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90471-N\n10.1038/370304a0\n10.1038/375791a0\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1667\n10.1006/dbio.1995.1150\n10.1038/35001077\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9528\n10.1101/gad.9.1.108\n10.1038/350473a0\n10.1007/PL00008193\n10.1073/pnas.93.2.900\n10.1128/MCB.23.16.5680-5691.2003\n10.4161/cam.5.2.14373\n10.1038/ncb2137\n10.1084/jem.20042097\n10.1093/nar/20.21.5661\n10.1242/dev.01393\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000052670.55321.87\n10.1074/jbc.M308730200\n10.1083/jcb.139.1.257\n10.1074/jbc.M305190200\n10.1007/s10456-005-9016-7\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.017\n10.1126/science.7512751\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65005-5\n10.1242/jcs.02399\n10.1083/jcb.148.2.343\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63597-3\n10.1074/jbc.274.3.1415\n10.1161/01.RES.0000120861.27064.09\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4069\n10.1089/lrb.2005.3.240\n10.4161/cam.1.4.5448\n10.1093/cvr/cvp133\n10.1101/gad.11.13.1674\n10.1016/S0022-4804(03)00042-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029099\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3431\n10.1182/blood-2007-07-104133\n10.1056/NEJM199909023411006\n10.1002/stem.90\n10.1182/blood-2009-12-259549\n10.1369/jhc.2008.952689\n10.1038/jid.2009.305\n10.1097/00001665-200607000-00031\n10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a491ce\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201875\n10.1073/pnas.172161899\n10.1073/pnas.0912710107\n10.1038/nature04186\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006562\n10.1038/ncb1507\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022052\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.019\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210760\n10.1517/14712598.2011.579096\n10.1073/pnas.95.18.10632\n10.1007/3-540-27310-7_2\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.009\n10.1038/nrm3230\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.043\n10.1038/nature04733\n10.1182/blood-2006-08-039651\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.08.086\n10.1038/onc.2011.174\n10.1038/embor.2009.102\n10.1016/j.molcel.2004.06.020\n10.1182/blood-2009-03-213496\n10.1074/jbc.M604175200\n10.1016/j.jss.2009.02.016\n10.1038/jid.2010.162\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1717\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0310\n10.1073/pnas.0701059104\n10.1038/nrc2253\n10.1182/blood-2002-10-3221\n10.1016/S0037-1963(03)00196-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2614\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6602631\n10.1073/pnas.1018859108\n10.1172/JCI39534\n10.1126/science.286.5439.531\n10.1038/nrc907\n10.1038/nature06174\n10.1038/nrc2826\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90533-K\n10.1038/344078a0\n10.1016/S0959-437X(05)80072-3\n10.1038/35012620\n10.1126/science.1097434\n10.1038/nrg2400\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90292-X\n10.1101/gad.976502\n10.1101/gad.9.6.663\n10.1093/nar/24.5.898\n10.1101/gad.12.2.261\n10.1101/gad.11.10.1327\n10.1038/nature716\n10.1128/MCB.24.2.924-935.2004\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00238.x\n10.1016/j.jss.2008.02.053\n10.1046/j.1432-0436.1997.6210033.x"}
{"title": "Hormonal regulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in granulosa cells.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is critical for the development of ovarian follicles. Blood vessels are abrogated from the follicle until ovulation, when they invade it to support the developing corpus luteum. Granulosa cells are known to secrete anti-angiogenic factors that shield against premature vascularization; however, their molecular identity is yet to be defined. In this study we address the physiological role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a well-known angiogenic inhibitor, in granulosa cells. We have shown that human and mouse primary granulosa cells express and secrete PEDF, and characterized its hormonal regulation. Stimulation of granulosa cells with increasing doses of estrogen caused a gradual decrease in the PEDF secretion, while stimulation with progesterone caused an abrupt decrease in its secretion. Moreover, We have shown, by time- and dose-response experiments, that the secreted PEDF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were inversely regulated by hCG; namely, PEDF level was nearly undetectable under high doses of hCG, while VEGF level was significantly elevated. The anti-angiogenic nature of the PEDF secreted from granulosa cells was examined by migration, proliferation and tube formation assays in cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Depleting PEDF from primary granulosa cells conditioned media accelerated endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tube formation. Collectively, the dynamic expression of PEDF that inversely portrays VEGF expression may imply its putative role as a physiological negative regulator of follicular angiogenesis.", "journal": "Molecular human reproduction", "date": "2012-10-19", "authors": ["DanaChuderland", "IdoBen-Ami", "RuthKaplan-Kraicer", "HadasGrossman", "AlisaKomsky", "RonitSatchi-Fainaro", "AnatEldar-Boock", "RaphaelRon-El", "RuthShalgi"], "doi": "10.1093/molehr/gas046"}

To achieve a satisfying functional and aesthetic outcome various anatomical aspects have to be considered such as the architecture of the bony structures as well as the very special shape of the orbit. Bone grafting is particularly challenging under these conditions, and one single graft type can hardly fulfil all anatomical demands. The presented method aims at combining a free microvascular bone graft and a preoperatively planned patient-specific alloplastic implant which takes into account all anatomic requirements as well as a functional rehabilitation including dental restoration.\nBy means of the described treatment approach, complex midfacial defects are reconstructed on the base of preoperative computer-assisted three-dimensional planning, a patient-specific prefabricated implant and a free vascularized bone transplant. A three-dimensional planning platform was used to create a mirror image of the unaffected contralateral side that was superimposed on the defect side referring to a virtual sagittal plane. The planned donor site of the scapula was then virtually matched into an ideal anatomic position considering all functional and aesthetical aspects, including a later implant based prosthodontic rehabilitation. By use of these virtual outlines, an individual titanium implant was manufactured to provide both for midfacial support and a graft fixture in a position, which was close to original. Intraoperative optical navigation was used to assess the accurate position of the implant with special regard to a correct reconstruction of the orbit. An implantologic rehabilitation could be achieved.\nThe technique presented offers an ideal combination of a patient-specific alloplastic implant for the reconstruction of the very demanding orbital anatomy in combination with a scapular flap offering a sufficient bone stock for an implant based prosthodontic rehabilitation.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2012-10-18", "authors": ["ChristianMertens", "HubertL\u00f6wenheim", "J\u00fcrgenHoffmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2012.09.003"}

Designing coculture systems is deemed a helpful method to understand the dynamic interaction of various cells involved in the angiogenesis process. We investigated the juxtacrine and paracrine interaction between 3 different cells, namely rat marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs), rat muscle-derived satellite cells (rSCs), and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs), and endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis process. In vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay was performed whereby ECs were monocultured or cocultured with rMSCs, rSCs, and rCMs or their conditioned media (CM). In addition, in vivo Matrigel plug assay for angiogenesis was conducted to assess the angiogenic potential of the rCM-, rMSC-, and rSC-derived CM. Our results demonstrated that the rMSCs, rSCs, and rCMs elongated along the EC tubules, whereas the rMSCs formed tube-like structures with sprouting tip cells, leading to improved angiogenesis in the coculture system. Moreover, the rMSC- and rSC-derived CM significantly improved angiogenesis tube formation on Matrigel, accelerated EC chemotaxis, and increased the arteriolar density, vascularization index, and vascularization flow index in the Matrigel plug in vivo. Western blotting showed that rMSCs secreted a high level of vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and stromal-derived factor-1-alpha. Tie2 is also shed from rMSCs.

{"title": "Turn over split fascial flap - a refinement for resurfacing shin defect.", "abstract": "Moderate size defects of the shin of tibia are frequently encountered following trauma and infection. They may be associated with or without a fracture. Such defects require resurfacing by a flap. Many different types of flaps have been described but most of them proved to be more bulky than desired. Although these procedures cover the defects successfully the results they produce are not aesthetically appropriate. The flap looks bulkier because the native subcutaneous tissue is thin over the shin and distal leg. Hence a search for a vascularized tissue of minimal bulk for suitable resurfacing was initiated. A turnover fascial flap fulfilled the requirement. Such a flap can be made thinner by splitting its distal part into two layers while maintaining a common vascular fascial pedicle with both the layers of the fascia. This allowed a larger surface area to be covered. Such refinement is based on the following parameters (a) fresh cadaveric dissection, (b) demonstration of live microcirculation individually in the superficial and deep layers of the deep fascia and (c) intraoperative flourescein study of the split fascial flap. The technique has been used in 5 cases over the upper and middle third of the shin of tibia. The split fascial flap was turned over and inset in the defect and covered with a split skin graft.

{"title": "MOSAIC: a multiscale model of osteogenesis and sprouting angiogenesis with lateral inhibition of endothelial cells.", "abstract": "The healing of a fracture depends largely on the development of a new blood vessel network (angiogenesis) in the callus. During angiogenesis tip cells lead the developing sprout in response to extracellular signals, amongst which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical. In order to ensure a correct development of the vasculature, the balance between stalk and tip cell phenotypes must be tightly controlled, which is primarily achieved by the Dll4-Notch1 signaling pathway. This study presents a novel multiscale model of osteogenesis and sprouting angiogenesis, incorporating lateral inhibition of endothelial cells (further denoted MOSAIC model) through Dll4-Notch1 signaling, and applies it to fracture healing. The MOSAIC model correctly predicted the bone regeneration process and recapitulated many experimentally observed aspects of tip cell selection: the salt and pepper pattern seen for cell fates, an increased tip cell density due to the loss of Dll4 and an excessive number of tip cells in high VEGF environments. When VEGF concentration was even further increased, the MOSAIC model predicted the absence of a vascular network and fracture healing, thereby leading to a non-union, which is a direct consequence of the mutual inhibition of neighboring cells through Dll4-Notch1 signaling. This result was not retrieved for a more phenomenological model that only considers extracellular signals for tip cell migration, which illustrates the importance of implementing the actual signaling pathway rather than phenomenological rules. Finally, the MOSAIC model demonstrated the importance of a proper criterion for tip cell selection and the need for experimental data to further explore this. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the MOSAIC model creates enhanced capabilities for investigating the influence of molecular mechanisms on angiogenesis and its relation to bone formation in a more mechanistic way and across different time and spatial scales.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2012-10-17", "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lieCarlier", "LiesbetGeris", "KatieBentley", "GeertCarmeliet", "PeterCarmeliet", "HansVan Oosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002724"}

In developing this hypothesis, we showed that ASCs are expanded in obesity and that they traffic from endogenous WAT to tumors in several mouse models of cancer. Strikingly, a comparison of circulating and tumor-infiltrating cell populations in lean, and obese mice revealed that cancer induces a six-fold increase of ASC frequency in the systemic circulation. We obtained evidence that ASCs mobilized in this way can be recruited into tumors, where they can be incorporated into blood vessels as pericytes and they can differentiate into adipocytes in an obesity-dependent manner. Extending this evidence, we found that increased tumor vascularization (reflected by changes in tumor vascular morphology and a two-fold increase in vascular density) was associated with intratumoral adipocytes and elevated proliferation of neighboring malignant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ASCs recruited from endogenous adipose tissue can be recruited by tumors to potentiate the supportive properties of the tumor microenvironment.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2012-10-17", "authors": ["YanZhang", "Alexes CDaquinag", "FelipeAmaya-Manzanares", "OlgaSirin", "ChiehTseng", "Mikhail GKolonin"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0294"}

However, these diseases are poorly defined clinically, making effective treatment difficult. Herein, we propose a new disease subset, termed meibomitis-related keratoconjunctivitis (MRKC). The ocular surface features of MRKC include: meibomitis with redness and swelling of the eyelid margin and palpebral conjunctiva; superficial vascularization and granulomatous nodules in the cornea; and conjunctival hyperemia, similar or identical to that observed in phlyctenular keratitis. The characteristics of MRKC patients include a significantly higher prevalence in women, multiple history of chalazia, close association with meibomitis, the presence of specific human leukocyte antigen association, high Propionibacterium acnes detection rates in meibum culture, and the effectiveness of systemic antimicrobial therapy targeting P. acnes. MRKC may share many clinical features with ocular rosacea, especially during childhood. The clinical effectiveness of systemic antimicrobial agents in treating both diseases suggests the importance of focusing on the elimination of bacteria such as P. acnes.", "journal": "Cornea", "date": "2012-10-17", "authors": ["TomoSuzuki"], "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0b013e31826a04dd"}
{"title": "Repair of bile duct defect with degradable stent and autologous tissue in a porcine model.", "abstract": "To introduce and evaluate a new method to repair bile duct defect with a degradable stent and autologous tissues.\nEight Ba-Ma mini-pigs were used in this study. Experimental models with common bile duct (CBD) defect (0.5-1.0 cm segment of CBD resected) were established and then CBD was reconstructed by duct to duct anastomosis with a novel degradable stent made of poly [sebacic acid-co-(1,3-propanediol)-co-(1,2-propanediol)]. In addition, a vascularized greater omentum was placed around the stent and both ends of CBD. Cholangiography via gall bladder was performed for each pig at postoperative months 1 and 3 to rule out stent translocation and bile duct stricture. Complete blood count was examined pre- and post-operatively to estimate the inflammatory reaction. Liver enzymes and serum bilirubin were examined pre- and post-operatively to evaluate the liver function. Five pigs were sacrificed at month 3 to evaluate the healing of anastomosis. The other three pigs were raised for one year for long-term observation.\nAll the animals underwent surgery successfully. There was no intraoperative mortality and no bile leakage during the observation period. The white blood cell counts were only slightly increased on day 14 and month 3 postoperatively compared with that before operation, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.652). The plasma level of alanine aminotransferase on day 14 and month 3 postoperatively was also not significantly elevated compared with that before operation (P = 0.810). Nevertheless, the plasma level of \u03b3-glutamyl transferase was increased after operation in both groups (P = 0.004), especially 2 wk after operation. The level of serum total bilirubin after operation was not significantly elevated compared with that before operation (P = 0.227), so did the serum direct bilirubin (P = 0.759). By cholangiography via gall bladder, we found that the stent maintained its integrity of shape and was still in situ at month 1, and it disappeared completely at month 3. No severe CBD dilation and stricture were observed at both months 1 and 3. No pig died during the 3-mo postoperative observation period. No sign of necrosis, bile duct stricture, bile leakage or abdominal abscess was found at reoperation at month 3 postoperatively. Pigs had neither fragments of stent nor stones formed in the CBD. Collagen deposit was observed in the anastomosis by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome stains. No severe cholestasis was observed in liver parenchyma by HE staining. Intestinal obstruction was found in a pig 4 mo after operation, and no bile leakage, bile duct stricture or biliary obstruction were observed in laparotomy. No sign of bile duct stricture or bile leakage was observed in the other two pigs.\nThe novel method for repairing bile duct defect yielded a good short-term effect without postoperative bile duct stricture.

Nodules were classified at RTE by four-class color scale. Patients with benign cytology underwent follow-up over 12 months, whereas patients with indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant cytology were surgically treated.\nAt follow-up, 126 nodules were malignant and 372 benign. RTE classes III-IV showed 81% sensitivity and 62% specificity. The presence of at least one US risk factor (hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular margins, intranodular vascularization, and taller than wide shape) had 85% sensitivity and 91% negative predictive value. When RTE was combined with US, the presence of at least one of the six parameters had 97% sensitivity and 97% negative predictive value, with an odds ratio of 15.8 (95% confidence interval 5.7-43.8).\nRTE is a valuable tool for detecting malignant thyroid lesions with a sensitivity similar to traditional US and CFD features.

The endothelium expresses Tyro3, Axl, and Mer and produces protein S. The interaction of protein S with endothelial cells and particularly its effects on angiogenesis have not yet been analyzed. Here we show that human protein S, at circulating concentrations, inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2-dependent vascularization of Matrigel plugs in vivo and the capacity of endothelial cells to form capillary-like networks in vitro as well as VEGF-A-induced endothelial migration and proliferation. Furthermore, protein S inhibited VEGF-A-induced endothelial VEGFR2 phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated kinase-Erk1/2 and Akt. Protein S activated the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and the SHP2 inhibitor NSC 87877 reversed the observed inhibition of VEGF-A-induced endothelial proliferation. Using siRNA directed against Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, we demonstrate that protein S-mediated SHP2 activation and inhibition of VEGF-A-stimulated proliferation were mediated by Mer.

However, the role of oxygen in fracture healing has not been fully studied. Here we systematically examine the effects of oxygen tension on fracture healing and test the ability of hyperoxia to rescue healing defects in a mouse model of ischemic fracture healing. Mice with tibia fracture were housed in custom-built gas chambers and groups breathed a constant atmosphere of 13% oxygen (hypoxia), 21% oxygen (normoxia), or 50% oxygen (hyperoxia). The influx of inflammatory cells to the fracture site, stem cell differentiation, tissue vascularization, and fracture healing were analyzed. In addition, the efficacy of hyperoxia (50% oxygen) as a treatment regimen for fracture nonunion was tested. Hypoxic animals had decreased tissue vascularity, decreased bone formation, and delayed callus remodeling. Hyperoxia increased tissue vascularization, altered fracture healing in un-complicated fractures, and improved bone repair in ischemia-induced delayed fracture union. However, neither hypoxia nor hyperoxia significantly altered chondrogenesis or osteogenesis during early stages of fracture healing, and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils was not affected by environmental oxygen after bone injury.

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is a critical receptor implicated in systemic vascular growth and remodeling, binds two distinct ligand families: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3). Although the function of VEGF-NRP1 interactions in vascular development is well described, the importance of SEMA3-NRP1 signaling in systemic or pulmonary vascular morphogenesis is debated. We sought to characterize the effect of deficient SEMA3-NRP1 signaling on fetal pulmonary vascular development in a mouse model. Temporospatial expression of Nrp1 and Sema3 mRNA and protein during murine fetal lung development was investigated, and the development of the pulmonary vasculature in transgenic mice deficient in Sema3-Nrp1 signaling was examined by histology, immunostaining, and electron microscopy. Loss of Sema3-Nrp1 signaling resulted in acute respiratory distress and high neonatal mortality. Pathohistological examination of mutants revealed immature and atelectatic regions in the lung, severely reduced capillary density, thickened alveolar septa containing centrally located dilated capillaries, hypertensive changes in arteriolar walls, anomalous and misaligned pulmonary veins, and reduced pulmonary surfactant secretion. Notably, many features are reminiscent of the fatal pulmonary disorder alveolar capillary dysplasia.

Based on the anatomic study, the free perforating branch flaps of the medial vastus muscle (14 cm x 6 cm to 20 cm x 5 cm) were used to repair skin and soft tissue defects (8 cm x 6 cm to 12 cm x 8 cm) of the feet in 4 patients between June 2009 and August 2011.\nThe artery of the medial vastus was sent out constantly from the femoral artery, and then descended in the vastus muscle to lateral patella where it anastomosed with the terminal branches of lateral femoral circumflex artery to form prepatellar vascular network. The artery of the medial vastus sent out 3-5 musculocutaneous perforating branches into the deep fascia and then extended superficially to the overlying skin. Four flaps survived after surgery; wounds at the donor site and recipient site healed by first intention. After follow-up of 6-12 months, the flaps had good appearance and texture.

{"title": "Regulation of a vascular plexus by gata4 is mediated in zebrafish through the chemokine sdf1a.", "abstract": "Using the zebrafish model we describe a previously unrecognized requirement for the transcription factor gata4 controlling embryonic angiogenesis. The development of a vascular plexus in the embryonic tail, the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), fails in embryos depleted of gata4. Rather than forming a normal vascular plexus, the CHT of gata4 morphants remains fused, and cells in the CHT express high levels of osteogenic markers ssp1 and runx1. Definitive progenitors emerge from the hemogenic aortic endothelium, but fail to colonize the poorly vascularized CHT. We also found abnormal patterns and levels for the chemokine sdf1a in gata4 morphants, which was found to be functionally relevant, since the embryos also show defects in development of the lateral line, a mechano-sensory organ system highly dependent on a gradient of sdf1a levels. Reduction of sdf1a levels was sufficient to rescue lateral line development, circulation, and CHT morphology. The result was surprising since neither gata4 nor sdf1a is obviously expressed in the CHT. Therefore, we generated transgenic fish that conditionally express a dominant-negative gata4 isoform, and determined that gata4 function is required during gastrulation, when it is co-expressed with sdf1a in lateral mesoderm. Our study shows that the gata4 gene regulates sdf1a levels during early embryogenesis, which impacts embryonic patterning and subsequently the development of the caudal vascular plexus.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-10-12", "authors": ["IngridTorregroza", "AudreyHoltzinger", "KarenMendelson", "Ting-ChunLiu", "TimothyHla", "ToddEvans"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0046844"}

Newly engineered tissues need to be properly vascularized and current candidates for in vitro tissue pre-vascularization are endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells. However, their use in therapy is hampered by their limited expansion capacity and lack of autologous sources. Our approach to engineering large grafts is to use hMSCs both as a source of cells for regeneration of targeted tissue and at the same time as the source of endothelial cells. Here we investigate how different stimuli influence endothelial differentiation of hMSCs. Although growth supplements together with shear force were not sufficient to differentiate hMSCs with respect to expression of endothelial markers such as CD31 and KDR, these conditions did prime the cells to differentiate into cells with an endothelial gene expression profile and morphology when seeded on Matrigel. In addition, we show that endothelial-like hMSCs are able to create a capillary network in 3D culture both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The expansion phase in the presence of growth supplements was crucial for the stability of the capillaries formed in vitro. To conclude, we established a robust protocol for endothelial differentiation of hMSCs, including an immortalized MSC line (iMSCs) which allows for reproducible in vitro analysis in further studies.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-10-12", "authors": ["KarolinaJaneczek Portalska", "AnneLeferink", "NathalieGroen", "HugoFernandes", "LorenzoMoroni", "Clemensvan Blitterswijk", "Jande Boer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0046842"}

Mesenchymal TN cell lines, which are the richest in putative tumor stem cells among the different breast cancer cell subtypes, were the most susceptible to apoptosis induced by CD34-TRAIL(+) cells. Indeed, tumor cell \"stemness\", assessed based on the proportion of CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) cells, was significantly correlated with susceptibility to TRAIL. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity experiments showed that CD34-TRAIL(+) cells selectively targeted CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) cells. Although in vivo treatment with CD34-TRAIL(+) cells did not lead to tumor growth inhibition, treated mice revealed significantly larger areas of necrosis associated with damage of tumor vasculature than did control mice. Moreover, lungs from MDA-MD-231 tumor-bearing mice were completely free of metastases at 12 days after the last injection of CD34-TRAIL(+) cells, whereas metastases were present in all control mouse lungs. An anti-metastatic effect of CD34-TRAIL(+) cells was also observed in a model of experimental lung metastases. The correlation between in vitro susceptibility to membrane-bound TRAIL and tumor stem cell content, together with CD34-TRAIL(+) cell-induced inhibition of the metastatic process, points to the selective targeting of cancer stem cells by CD34-armed cells and the potential value of such cells in eradicating tumor stem cells before the onset of overt metastases.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2012-10-12", "authors": ["AnnaRossini", "MartaGiussani", "AriannaGiacomini", "CarlaGuarnotta", "EldaTagliabue", "AndreaBalsari"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-012-2281-4\n10.4161/cbt.4.2.1508\n10.1016/S1044-579X(02)00132-3\n10.1038/35037728\n10.1016/1074-7613(95)90057-8\n10.1038/nrd2637\n10.1089/hum.2006.17.1225\n10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.010\n10.1182/blood-2005-08-3182\n10.1172/JCI24751\n10.1038/nature04186\n10.1038/gt.2008.41\n10.1182/blood-2009-08-239632\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.008\n10.1093/jnci/djn419\n10.1007/s10549-008-9924-5\n10.1073/pnas.0530291100\n10.1186/bcr2635\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.03.027\n10.1074/jbc.M110.206615\n10.1093/jnci/djh299\n10.1016/S1535-6108(04)00116-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4024\n10.1002/hep.20807\n10.1007/s00262-012-1200-1\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4698"}

In addition, \u03b2-cells in islets are extremely sensitive to inflammation. \u03b1-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), a circulating serine-protease inhibitor that is available for clinical use as an affinity-purified human product, has been shown to protect islets from graft failure in mouse transplantation models and to achieve readily vascularized islet grafts. AAT is known to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and release, as well as protect from proteolytic cleavage of VEGF by elastase, promote viability of endothelial cells, and enhance migration of myocytes. Our aim was to examine whether AAT enhances vasculogenesis toward islet grafts. We employed Matrigel-islet plugs as means to introduce islets in an explantable isolated compartment and examined vessel formation, vessel maturation, and inflammatory profile of explants 9 days after implantation. Also, we examined primary epithelial cell grafts that were prepared from lungs of mice that are transgenic for human AAT. In addition, aortic ring sprouting assay was performed, and HUVEC tube formation assays were studied in the presence of AAT. Our findings indicate that islet grafts exhibit mature vessels in the presence of AAT, as demonstrated by morphology, as well as expression of endothelial CD31, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Epithelial cells that express human AAT achieved a similar positive outcome. Aortic ring sprouting was enhanced in AAT-treated cultures and also in cultures that contained primary epithelial cells from human AAT transgenic animals in the absence of added AAT. According to the tube formation assay, HUVECs exhibited superior responses in the presence of AAT. We conclude that vasculogenesis toward islet grafts is enhanced in the presence of AAT.

Blocking these molecules has not only shown success in the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses, but also prolonged graft survival in various models of solid organ transplantation.

This triple-layer technique is comprised of autologous fascia lata, acellular dermal allograft, and a vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF). The technique is described and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rate is evaluated.\nRetrospective review over a 2-year period identified 10 patients who underwent a purely EET approach for resection of ASB tumors. Patients who underwent combined cranionasal approaches and those treated for ASB encephaloceles were excluded from this study. After tumor resection, patients underwent triple-layer reconstruction using autologous fascia lata inlay, acellular dermal allograft inlay/overlay, followed by a PNSF to reconstruct the cribriform defect. No postoperative lumbar drainage was used.\nThe average cribriform defect size was 9.1 (range, 5.0-13.8) cm(2) . All 10 patients underwent successful reconstruction with a postoperative CSF leak rate of 0% without the use of postoperative lumbar drainage. The mean follow-up period was 7.4 (range, 2-17) months. The mean age was 45.8 (range, 15-81) years with 30% of the patients being females.\nThe triple-layer reconstruction technique is effective in reconstructing large ASB defects after endoscopic resection of the cribriform plate.

{"title": "Interaction of the hepatitis B spliced protein with cathepsin B promotes hepatoma cell migration and invasion.", "abstract": "Hepatitis B spliced protein (HBSP) is involved in the pathogenicity and/or persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Chronic HBV infection is one of the most important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether or not HBSP contributes to the progression of HBV-associated HCC remains unknown. This study reports that overexpression of HBSP in human hepatoma cells increased cell invasion and motility. Conversely, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HBSP expression inhibited migration and invasion. By glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown, coimmunoprecipitation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay, HBSP was found to directly interact with cathepsin B (CTSB). Similar to HBSP knockdown, knocking down CTSB also reduced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the HBSP-overexpressing hepatoma cells were shown to have increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and overexpression of HBSP significantly enhanced tumor-induced vascularization of endothelial cells. In contrast, knockdown of either HBSP or CTSB by siRNA resulted in inhibition of the two proteolytic enzymes and of the in vitro angiogenesis. Expression of HBSP in the hepatoma cells appeared to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathway, as evidenced by increases in phosphorylation of p38, Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Akt. Taken together, these findings imply that interaction of HBSP with CTSB may promote hepatoma cell motility and invasion and highlight new molecular mechanisms for HBSP-induced HCC progression that involve the secretion and activation of proteolytic enzymes, increased tumor-induced angiogenesis, and activation of the MAPK/Akt signaling, thereby leading to the aggressiveness of hepatoma cells.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2012-10-05", "authors": ["Wan-NanChen", "Jin-YanChen", "Bo-YanJiao", "Wan-SongLin", "Yun-LiWu", "Ling-LingLiu", "XuLin"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.02095-12"}

One side of the lesion was filled with a PRFM while the contralateral was left untreated (controls). Animals were sacrificed at 5, 10, 40 and 60 days from surgery. Histological, immunohistochemical and histomorphometric analyses were performed to evaluate muscle regeneration, neovascularization, fibrosis and inflammation. The presence of metaplasia zones, calcifications and heterotopic ossification were also assessed. PRFM treated muscles exhibited an improved muscular regeneration, an increase in neovascularization, and a slight reduction of fibrosis compared with controls. No differences were detected for inflammation. Metaplasia, ossification and heterotopic calcification were not detected. This preliminary morphological experimental study shows that PRFM use can improve muscle regeneration and long-term vascularization.

Transplantation of pancreatic islets into alternative sites is preferable, but challenging, as it may require a three-dimensional vehicle to confer mechanical protection and to confine islets to a well-defined, retrievable space where islet neovascularization can occur. We have fabricated biostable, macroporous scaffolds from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and investigated islet retention and distribution, metabolic function, and glucose-dependent insulin secretion within these scaffolds. Islets from multiple sources, including rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, were tested in vitro. We observed high islet retention and distribution within PDMS scaffolds, with retention of small islets (< 100 \u00b5m) improved through the postloading addition of fibrin gel. Islets loaded within PDMS scaffolds exhibited viability and function comparable to standard culture conditions when incubated under normal oxygen tensions, but displayed improved viability compared to standard two-dimensional culture controls under low oxygen tensions. In vivo efficacy of scaffolds to support islet grafts was evaluated after transplantation in the omental pouch of chemically induced diabetic syngeneic rats, which promptly achieved normoglycemia.

Based on previous published data we became interested in studying the interaction between these three groups of lipid derivatives in the rat uterus during the window of implantation. Thus, we adopted a pharmacological approach in vitro using LPA, DGPP (a selective antagonist of LPA3, an LPA receptor), endocannabinoids' receptor selective antagonists (AM251 and AM630) and non selective (indomethacin) and selective (NS-398) inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 enzymes. Cyclooxygenase isoforms participate in prostaglandins' synthesis. The incubation of the uterus from rats pregnant on day 5 of gestation (implantation window) with LPA augmented the activity and the expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the main enzyme involved in the degradation of endocannabinoids in the rodent uteri, suggesting that LPA decreased endocannabinoids' levels during embryo implantation. It has been reported that high endocannabinoids are deleterious for implantation. Also, LPA increased PGE2 production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The incubation of LPA with indomethacin or NS-398 reversed the increment in PGE2 production, suggesting that cyclooxygenase-2 was the isoform involved in LPA effect. PGs are important mediators of decidualization and vascularization at the implantation sites. All these effects were mediated by LPA3, as the incubation with DGPP completely reversed LPA stimulatory actions. Besides, we also observed that endocannabinoids mediated the stimulatory effect of LPA on cyclooxygenase-2 derived PGE2 production, as the incubation of LPA with AM251 or AM630 completely reversed LPA effect. Also, LPA augmented via LPA3 decidualization and vascularization markers.

Carotid bodies make afferent connections with fibers from sensory neurons in the petrosal ganglia and receive efferent inhibitory innervation from parasympathetic neurons located in the carotid sinus and glossopharyngeal nerves. There are synapses between type I (chemosensory) cells and petrosal afferent terminals, as well as between neighboring type I cells. There is a broad array of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and their ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in the carotid body.

{"title": "Engineering vascularized bone graft with osteogenic and angiogenic lineage differentiated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Tissue-engineered bone provides a promising method for the rehabilitation of acquired bone defects and congenital deformities. However, generating a vascular supply to the engineered graft remains a major challenge. We report a novel strategy to engineer vascularized bone grafts with osteogenic and angiogenic lineage differentiated marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs were expanded to form an osteogenic cell sheet using a continuous culture method and a scraping technique under osteogenic culture conditions. Another portion of MSCs was directed to differentiate into highly proliferative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which were then seeded onto the cell sheets. Cell sheet-EPC complexes were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. Cell sheets without EPCs were also implanted as a control. The mice were sacrificed, and the samples were harvested for evaluation consisting of micro-CT scanning, histological analysis and scanning electronic microscopy 4 and 8 weeks after implantation. The results showed that cell sheets were composed of viable cells and extracellular matrix and showed apparent mineralization. The obtained EPCs could express the specific antigen marker of CD31 and form capillary-like structures in vitro. The osteogenic cell sheet-EPC complexes yielded well-vascularized bone grafts 4 and 8 weeks after implantation.

Chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2 play a key role in generation and regulation of CXC chemokine signaling. CXCR1 is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8), a pro-inflammatory chemokine, and CXCR1/2 are crucially involved in the prostate cancer development and progression. Thus, we generated a high-affinity human CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitor, CXCL8 (3-72) K11R/G31P, named G31P, which is a synthetic derivative of the human cytokine, IL-8. In this study, we investigated the effects of G31P on regulation of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts. Cell viability, adhesion, and wound healing assays were used to assess the effects of G31P on growth, adhesion, and migration of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in vitro, respectively. Nude mouse xenografts and xenograft implantation assays were performed to determine the effect of G31P on PC-3 cells in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect gene expression, and fluorescence imaging was used to detect tumor volume and microvessel density in tumor xenografts. The data showed that G31P treatment significantly reduced PC-3 cell viability, adhesion and migration capacity in a dose-dependent manner (up to 100 ng/ml). Additionally, G31P treatment of nude mice suppressed the growth of orthotopically transplanted tumor xenografts. G31P also inhibited tumor tissue vascularization, which was associated with the decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and nuclear transcription factor (NF)-\u03baB in orthotopic xenograft tissues.

{"title": "Genes promoting and disturbing testis development.", "abstract": "Mammals have an XX/XY sex chromosomal sex determination system in which males represent the heterogametic sex. The Y-linked gene, SRY, determines sex by inducing the undifferentiated, bipotential gonads to differentiate as testes, which produce androgens and promote in this way the development of a male phenotype. Thus, in mammals, sex determination can be equated to testis determination, which involves several important cell processes, including Sertoli cell differentiation, mesonephric cell migration, testis cord formation, testis-specific vascularization, and myoid and Leydig cell differentiation. Many genes are currently known to be involved in testis development. Some of them, including SF1, WT1, GATA4 and FOG2, are necessary for the formation of the bipotential, undifferentiated gonad but also have important roles in testis differentiation. Others can be considered testis-promoting, differentaition and/or maintenance genes: these include SRY, SOX9, FGF9, PTGDS, SOX8, SOX3, NR0B1, PDGFRa, DMRT1, AMH, NGF, NTF3 and NGFR as the most important examples. Finally, there is a smaller group of genes which are involved in ovarian development and which can cause aberrant testis development if mutated, including RSPO1, WNT4, CTNNB1, FST, BMP2 and FOXL2.

A number of previous techniques have been proposed to spatially regulate the distribution of angiogenic biomolecules and vascular cells within biomaterial matrices to promote vascularization. Most of these approaches have been limited to two-dimensional (2D) micropatterned features or have resulted in formation of random vasculature within three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. In this study, we investigate 3D endothelial cord formation within micropatterned gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels with varying geometrical features (50-150 \u03bcm height). We demonstrated the significant dependence of endothelial cells proliferation, alignment and cord formation on geometrical dimensions of the patterned features. The cells were able to align and organize within the micropatterned constructs and assemble to form cord structures with organized actin fibers and circular/elliptical cross-sections. The inner layer of the cord structure was filled with gel showing that the micropatterned hydrogel constructs guided the assembly of endothelial cells into cord structures. Notably, the endothelial cords were retained within the hydrogel microconstructs for all geometries after two weeks of culture; however, only the 100 \u03bcm-high constructs provided the optimal microenvironment for the formation of circular and stable cord structures.

The capture of HIF-1\u03b1 by pVHL is regulated by an oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of a specific conserved prolyl residue. The VHL gene is mutated in the von Hippel-Lindau cancer predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors and is associated with constitutively high levels of HIF-1\u03b1. The disturbance of the dynamic coupling between HIF-1\u03b1 and pVHL bearing the commonly found mutation F76del was experimentally confirmed but the mechanism of such complex disruption is still not clear. Performing unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the F76del mutation may enlarge the HIF binding pocket in pVHL and induce the formation of an internal cavity in the hydrophobic core of the \u03b2-domain, which can lead to a partial destabilization of the \u03b2-sheets S1, S4, and S7 and a consequent loss of hydrogen bonds with a conserved recognition motif in HIF. The newly formed cavity has a significant druggability score and may be a suitable target for stabilizing ligands.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key regulators of the homeostatic response to low oxygen levels. HIF-1\u03b1 is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including breast cancer. Hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF transcription factors has been shown to lead to NOTCH activation in vitro in different contexts and tissues, causing differentiation arrest and induction of proliferation and migration.\nSince the link between HIF-1\u03b1 and NOTCH signalling has hardly been studied, we set out to closely investigate associations between the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and NOTCH pathway members in primary and metastatic human breast cancer specimens and their prognostic value.\nCo-expression of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and HIF-1\u03b1 was associated with a high grade and a high proliferation rate in invasive breast cancer.

In an orthotopic transplantation model of retinoblastoma, TF was selectively expressed in the proliferative area of retinoblastoma including tumor vessels as well as tumor cells, where TF expression was co-localized with endothelial cells of tumor vessels. TF expression progressively increased with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which was effectively inhibited by blockade of the TF pathway by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). In addition, FGF-2-induced angiogenic processes of migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells were also effectively suppressed by TFPI, which would be mediated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Therefore, further to our previous report that TF is involved in tumor cell proliferation of retinoblastoma, our current data suggest that blockade of the TF pathway by TFPI could effectively inhibit tumor growth by suppressing tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis at the same time.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2012-09-26", "authors": ["Hyun BeomSong", "Kyung DukPark", "Jin HyoungKim", "Dong HunKim", "Young SukYu", "Jeong HunKim"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2012.2048"}
{"title": "Imaging metastasis using an integrin-targeting chain-shaped nanoparticle.", "abstract": "While the enhanced permeability and retention effect may promote the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles into well-vascularized primary tumors, it is ineffective in the case of metastases hidden within a large population of normal cells. Due to their small size, high dispersion to organs, and low vascularization, metastatic tumors are less accessible to targeted nanoparticles. To tackle these challenges, we designed a nanoparticle for vascular targeting based on an \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) integrin-targeted nanochain particle composed of four iron oxide nanospheres chemically linked in a linear assembly. The chain-shaped nanoparticles enabled enhanced \"sensing\" of the tumor-associated remodeling of the vascular bed, offering increased likelihood of specific recognition of metastatic tumors. Compared to spherical nanoparticles, the chain-shaped nanoparticles resulted in superior targeting of \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) integrin due to geometrically enhanced multivalent docking.

In this study, a method is described for generating composite hydrogels in which porous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels serve as scaffolds for mechanical and structural support, and fibrin is loaded within the pores to induce vascularized tissue formation. Porous PEG hydrogels were generated by a salt leaching technique with 100-150-\u03bcm pore size and thrombin (Tb) preloaded within the scaffold. Fibrinogen (Fg) was loaded into pores with varying concentrations and polymerized into fibrin due to the presence of Tb, with loading efficiencies ranging from 79.9% to 82.4%. Fibrin was distributed throughout the entire porous hydrogels, lasted for greater than 20 days, and increased hydrogel mechanical stiffness. A rodent subcutaneous implant model was used to evaluate the influence of fibrin loading on in vivo response. At weeks 1, 2, and 3, all hydrogels had significant tissue invasion, but no difference in the depth of invasion was found with the Fg concentration. Hydrogels with fibrin loading induced more vascularization, with a significantly higher vascular density at 20\u2009mg/mL (week 1) and 40\u2009mg/mL (weeks 2 and 3) Fg concentration compared to hydrogels without fibrin.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed several small blood streams spurting from the surface of massively vascularized myxoma into the left atrium. Coronary angiography showed a feeding artery which arose from the right coronary artery and supplied the left atrial myxoma, with no evidence of coronary artery stenosis. This case demonstrated that TTE might be helpful for confirming the neovascularization of myxoma in the left atrium and finding the abnormal blood flow that spurts from the neovascularized myxoma.

Because of limited efficacy of the current monotherapies, there is a strong demand for the dual targeting of endothelial cells and pericytes. Here, we identify Olfactomedin-like 3 (Olfml3) as a novel proangiogenic cue within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived Olfml3 is produced by both tumor endothelial cells and accompanying pericytes and deposited in the perivascular compartment. Blockade of Olfml3 by anti-Olfml3 antibodies is highly effective in reducing tumor vascularization, pericyte coverage, and tumor growth. In vitro, Olfml3 targeting is sufficient to inhibit endothelioma cell migration and sprouting. Olfml3 alone or through binding to BMP4 enhances the canonical SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway required for BMP4-induced angiogenesis.

Factors such as lack of suitable donor sites and poor skin quality, however, have led to the development of artificial dermal substitutes. The investigation of mechanisms leading to enhanced functionality of these skin substitutes has been attracting great attention. This study aimed to investigate the effect of autologous stem cells on the integration and vascularization of a dermal substitute in full-thickness skin wounds, in a murine model. Two cell populations were compared, whole bone marrow cells and cultivated mesenchymal stem cells, isolated from mice transgenic for the enhanced green fluorescent protein, which allowed tracking of the transplanted cells. The number of cells colonizing the dermal substitute, as well as vascular density, were higher in mice receiving total bone marrow and particularly mesenchymal stem cells, than in control animals. The effect was more pronounced in animals treated with mesenchymal stem cells, which located primarily in the wound bed, suggesting a paracrine therapeutic mechanism.

SVVYGLRGGY (SV-Y) conjugated GPT (SV-GPT) hydrogels were formed in situ via enzyme-mediated reaction using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)).

In vitro cell studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in vivo subcutaneous injection studies were performed to confirm the effect of the SVVYGLR peptide on HUVEC activity and neo-vascularization. Obtained results demonstrated that the in situ conjugation of SVVYGLR sequences into phenol residues of GPT hydrogels enhanced the activity of HUVECs in vitro and stimulated the formation of new blood vessels in the hydrogel matrices in vivo.

The combination of endothelial cells with current TE strategies seems the most promising approach but doubts persist as to which type of endothelial cells to use. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells have been suggested as a possible source of endothelial progenitors. Osteoblasts obtained from human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were co-cultured with the mononuclear fraction of human UCB for 7 and 21 days on carrageenan membranes. The expression of vWF and CD31, and the DiI-AcLDL uptake ability allowed detection of the presence of endothelial and monocytic lineages cells in the co-culture for all culture times. In addition, the molecular expression of CD31 and VE-cadherin increased after 21 days of co-culture. The functionality of the system was assessed after transplantation in nude mice. Although an inflammatory response developed, blood vessels with cells positive for human CD31 were detected around the membranes. Furthermore, the number of blood vessels in the vicinity of the implants increased when cells from the mononuclear fraction of UCB were present in the transplants compared to transplants with only hASC-derived osteoblasts. These results show how endothelial progenitors present in the mononuclear fraction of UCB can be sustained by hASC-derived osteoblast co-culture and contribute to angiogenesis even in an in vivo setting of inflammatory response.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-09-22", "authors": ["R PPirraco", "BMelo-Ferreira", "T CSantos", "A MFrias", "A PMarques", "R LReis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.09.013"}

Current strategies for bone tissue engineering using a preformed scaffold have not resulted in the expected clinical regeneration due to difficulty in seeding cells into the deep internal space of scaffold, and the inability to inject them in minimally invasive surgeries. In this study, we used the osteoconductive and mechanical properties of nano-scale calcium sulfate (nCS) and the biocompatibility of alginate to develop the injectable nCS/alginate (nCS/A) paste, and characterized the effect of this nCS/A paste loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene-modified rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on bone and blood vessel growth. Our results showed that the nCS/A paste was injectable under small injection forces. The mechanical properties of the nCS/A paste were increased with an increased proportion of alginate. MSCs maintained their viability after the injection, and MSCs and BMP2 gene-modified MSCs in the injectable pastes remained viable, osteodifferentiated, and yielded high alkaline phosphatase activity. By testing the ability of this injectable paste and BMP2-gene-modified MSCs for the repair of critical-sized calvarial bone defects in a rat model, we found that BMP2-gene-modified MSCs in nCS/A (nCS/A+M/B2) showed robust osteogenic activity, which resulted in consistent bone bridging of the bone defects. The vessel density in nCS/A+M/B2 was significantly higher than that in the groups of blank control, nCS/A alone, and nCS/A mixed with MSCs (nCS/A+M).

Clinical and preclinical data suggest that ZOL may have also anti-angiogenic activity; however, the effects of Dmab (a fully humanized antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) on angiogenesis are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the potential anti-angiogenic activity of Dmab with that of ZOL in preclinical models. Dmab (0.31 to 160 \u03bcM) had no effect on the viability of human MDA-MB-436 and CG5 breast cancer cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and no effect on tubule formation or invasion of HUVECs. In contrast, ZOL (0.31 to 160 \u03bcM) decreased the viability of breast cancer and HUVECs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and also inhibited HUVEC tubule formation and invasion. In vivo, ZOL (20 \u03bcg/mouse for three times a week for three consecutive weeks) inhibited angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs and inhibited the growth and neo-angiogenesis of CG5 xenografts in athymic nude mice.

The present study evaluated the impact of natural infection by larvae of Ortleppascaris sp. (Nematoda: Ascaridida) in the liver of the cane toad Rhinella marina (Linnaeus, 1758). Larvae were encysted in nodules delimited by collagenous fibers and fibroblasts or freely within the hepatic parenchyma, provoking a clear response from the host. The histological examination of the liver revealed viable larvae in a number of different developmental stages, as well as cysts filled with amorphous material and cell residues and surrounded by dense fibrotic tissue. The infection of the liver by these larvae induces a significant increase in the area occupied by melanomacrophages and a reduction or deficit in the vascularization of the liver, hypertrophy of the hepatocytes, vacuolar bodies, and cytoplasmatic granules. Focal concentrations of inflammatory infiltrates were observed enclosing the unencapsulated early-stage larvae.

Accumulation of these molecular changes apparently constitutes the basis of cell ageing. 17b-estradiol (E2) has a key role in skin ageing homeostasis as evidenced by the accelerated decline in skin appearance seen in the perimenopausal years. Oestrogens improve many aspects of the skin such as skin thickness, vascularization, collagen content and quality. Despite these clinical evidences, the effects of oestrogens on skin at the cellular level need further clarification.\nHaCaT and human fibroblasts were cultured under various conditions with E2 and H2 O2 ; then were subjected to immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. Lipoperoxidation was investigated using BODIPY.\nIn human fibroblasts oxidative stress decreases procollagen-I synthesis, while E2 significantly increases it. Fibroblasts and HaCaT cells viability in the presence of E2 demonstrates a notably increased resistance to H2 O2 effects. Furthermore E2 is able to counteract H2 O2 -mediated lipoperoxidation and DNA oxidative damage in skin cells.\nIn this study we highlight that the menopause-associated oestrogens decline is involved in reduced collagen production and that E2 could counteract the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on the dermal compartment during skin aging. Furthermore, our data show that physiological concentrations of oestrogens are able to interfere with ROS-mediated cell viability reduction and to protect human skin cells against oxidative damage to cellular membranes and nucleic acids structure.\nOur experimental data show that the presence of 17\u03b2-estradiol may protect skin cells against oxidative damage and that the dramatic lowering of oestrogen levels during menopause, could render skin more susceptible to oxidative damage.", "journal": "Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV", "date": "2012-09-20", "authors": ["GBottai", "RMancina", "MMuratori", "PDi Gennaro", "TLotti"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04697.x"}

While the use of osteoblast/endothelial cell cocultures on three-dimensional constructs has shown promise for increasing in vivo vascularization, in vitro maintenance of cellular viability remains problematic. This study used perfusion flow to increase osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression, decrease hypoxic gene expression, and increase cell and matrix coverage in osteoblast/endothelial cell co-cultures. Mouse osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) were cultured alone and in co-culture with mouse microvascular endothelial cells (EOMA) on three-dimensional scaffolds for 1, 2, 7, and 14 days with or without perfusion flow. mRNA levels were determined for several osteogenic, angiogenic, and hypoxia-related genes, and histological analysis was performed. Perfusion flow downregulated hypoxia-related genes (HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and OPN) at early timepoints, upregulated osteogenic genes (ALP and OCN) at 7 days, and downregulated RUNX-2 and VEGF mRNA at 14 days in osteoblast monocultures. Perfusion flow increased cell number, coverage of the scaffold perimeter, and matrix area in the center of scaffolds at 14 days. Additionally, perfusion flow increased the length of endothelial cell aggregations within co-cultures.

Of these, 17 were confirmed thyroid carcinoma, while six were initially misdiagnosed. These included four carotid body tumors, one para-esophageal abscess, and one undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Thyroid carcinomas occurred in older dogs without evidence of sex predilection, and were more often unilateral. All were large, heterogeneous, moderately to strongly vascularized, and most commonly contained areas of dystrophic mineralization and/or fluid accumulations. On MRI, thyroid carcinomas appeared hyperintense compared to surrounding musculature in all imaging sequences used, while on CT they had a lower attenuation value than normal thyroid gland tissue. Histologically confirmed tumor capsule disruption with invasion of the surrounding structures was most commonly detected with MRI. Palpation was not an accurate predictor of locally invasive vs. well-encapsulated masses. Computed tomography had the highest specificity (100%) and MRI had the highest sensitivity (93%) in diagnosing thyroid carcinoma, while ultrasound had considerably lower results.

{"title": "Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma: similarities and differences in immunoprofile compared with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an uncommon renal neoplasm composed of thin fibrous septa lining multiple cystic spaces and associated with an excellent prognosis. Clear cells with generally low-grade nuclear features line the cystic spaces and may be present within the fibrous septa, although solid mass-forming areas are by definition absent. Despite the excellent prognosis, molecular-genetic alterations are similar to those of clear cell RCC. Immunohistochemical staining characteristics, however, have not been well elucidated. We studied 24 cases of multilocular cystic RCC, classified according to the 2004 World Health Organization System. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an automated immunostainer for CD10, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA-racemase, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin CAM 5.2, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), estrogen/progesterone receptors, smooth muscle actin, PAX-2, and vimentin. Twenty-four cases of grade 1 to 2 clear cell RCC were stained for comparison. Multilocular cystic RCC and control cases of clear cell RCC showed the following results, respectively: CD10 (63%, 96%), CK7 (92%, 38%), \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (21%, 67%), vimentin (58%, 33%), estrogen receptor (8%, 8%), CAM 5.2 (100%, 96%), EMA, CA-IX, PAX-2 (all 100%), and progesterone receptor (0%). Smooth muscle actin highlighted myofibroblastic cells within the septa of multilocular cystic RCC and the fine capillary vascular network of clear cell RCC. In summary, multilocular cystic RCC showed expression of common clear cell RCC markers CA-IX, EMA, and PAX-2, supporting the hypothesis that multilocular cystic RCC is a subtype of clear cell RCC. In contrast to clear cell RCC, tumors less frequently expressed CD10 (63% and often focal vs. 96% and diffuse) and more frequently expressed CK7 (92%), often diffusely (63%). Coexpression of CA-IX and CK7 represents a point of overlap with the recently described clear cell papillary RCC, which also may show a prominent cystic architecture.

Although clinical studies have linked vitamin D with increased muscle function and strength, little is known of its underlying molecular mechanism. We recently demonstrated that 1,25-D3 exerts a direct pro-myogenic effect on skeletal muscle cells; this has provoked our investigation of 1,25-D's effect on angiogenesis, a vital process for new capillary development and tissue repair. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which 1,25-D3 modulates key angiogenic growth factors and angiogenic inhibitors. C(2)C(12) myoblasts were incubated with 100 nM 1,25-D3 or placebo for 1, 4 and 10 days. At the end of the respective incubation time, total RNA was isolated for PCR arrays and for qRT-PCR. Total proteins were isolated for Western blots and proteome profiler arrays. The addition of 1,25-D3 to C(2)C(12) myoblasts increased VEGFa and FGF-1: two pro-angiogenic growth factors that promote neo-vascularization and tissue regeneration, and decreased FGF-2 and TIMP-3: two myogenic and/or angiogenic inhibitors. Our previous study demonstrated that 1,25-D3 altered IGF-I/II expression, consistent with the observed changes in VEGFa and FGF-2 expression. These results extend our previous findings and demonstrate the modulation of angiogenesis which may be an additional mechanism by which 1,25-D3 promotes myogenesis.

In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the potential of the PRP-ADSC-laden microspheres. Two intriguing observations were made in this study. First, we demonstrated that PRP sustained cell viability and meanwhile promoted cell migration from the interior of alginate microspheres to the surface. This phenomenon indicated that encapsulated cells have the potential to directly and actively participate into the regeneration process. Second, in vivo, a blood vessel network was found within the 10% PRP and 15% PRP-ADSC implants, which was associated with a significant increase in mineralization. It suggested that the PRP-ADSC-laden microspheres did enhance the vascularization and mineralization.

Nevertheless, dynamic studies of the uptake of contrast material provide important information for the characterization of neoplasms that, together with the usual signs, can help to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors of adipocyte, chondroid, or neural lineage, clearing up diagnostic uncertainty in certain benign lesions such as osteoid osteoma and ischemic musculoskeletal disease.

Stage of the estrous cycle in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes was synchronized using the Ovsynch with timed AI program and buffaloes were mated by AI in both the breeding season (N = 131) and transition period (N = 125). Detailed investigation of CL structure and function was undertaken in 39 buffaloes at each of the respective times using realtime B-mode/color-Doppler ultrasonography on Days 10 and 20 after AI. Progesterone (P4) concentrations were determined by RIA in all buffaloes. Pregnancy rate on Day 45 after AI was greater (P < 0.05) during the breeding season (58.0%) than the transitional period (45.6%) and this was primarily the result of a lower (P < 0.05) late embryonic mortality during the breeding season (7.3%) compared with the transition period (23%). Circulating concentrations of P4 on Days 10 and 20 after AI were greater (P < 0.01) during the breeding season (4.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.2, respectively) than during the transition period (1.6 \u00b1 0.12 and 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, respectively), and this was independent of reproductive status as there was no interaction between pregnancy and season. Corpus luteum time average medium velocity at Day 10 after AI was greater (P < 0.01) during the breeding season (19.3 \u00b1 1.5) than in the transitional period (8.3 \u00b1 0.7).

The findings were interpreted to indicate that relationships between CL vascularization, CL function, and pregnancy outcome in AI in buffaloes are consistent across the breeding season and transition period to the nonbreeding season.

Recently reported in children, vascularized periosteal grafts showed promising revascularizing properties. We report a novel technique using a pedicled periosteal graft from the first metatarsal bone to treat steroid-induced early Ficat-Arlet stage III ONT in an 11-year-old boy. The patient presented initial favorable clinical and radiological results which were maintained at 34 months during the last follow-up.

A reliable in vivo animal model is required for investigations in vascularized whole-limb CTA. The model should allow in vivo assessment in whole-limb preservation, allograft and xenograft response, and host immunomodulation. The goal of this study is to describe and evaluate the in vivo feasibility and reproducibility of a whole-limb porcine model as a basis for future research in this field.\nIn seven large white pigs, one forelimb was amputated under anesthesia and autotransplanted heterotopically with an arc of rotation of 180\u00b0 and partially placed in a subcutaneous pocket. Clinical parameters were monitored and muscle biopsies were analyzed using ultrastructural morphological assessment of mitochondria quality after an observation period of 7 days.\nAll animals could fully mobilize postoperatively without restrictions. At sacrifice, the anastomosed pedicle vessels of the limb were patent in six animals. In one pig, venous thrombosis could be observed. Muscle response was triggered following direct electrostimulation in six replanted limbs. The replanted extremities gained 12.97% weight within 7 days postreplantation compared with the amputation baseline values (P = 0.464 while maintaining normal compartment pressures at sacrifice (8.25 \u00b1 5.31 cmH(2)O, P = 0.60). The ultrastructural evaluation of mitochondria morphology revealed intact mitochondria without signs of ischemia/reperfusion damage.\nThis porcine model proved feasible, reliable, and reproducible for whole-limb autotransplantation.

FVFHG was performed on 12 patients with giant cell tumors of the distal radius between April 1984 and July 2005. The mean age of patients was 33 years. All 12 patients were classified as Enneking stage 2. Outcomes were evaluated with radiographic and functional assessments, including the scale of Enneking. The mean follow-up period was 6.26 years. Bone union was achieved in all patients at a mean of 15.7 weeks after surgery. Skin grafting was performed at the recipient site in 5 patients and had good skin healing. Subluxation in the wrist joint was observed in 5 patients and was related to the length of the transplanted fibula. The 5 patients with subluxation experienced considerable osteoarthritic change. The mean arc of flexion-extension and rotation of the wrist joint was 73.1\u00b0 and 102.9\u00b0, respectively. The mean grip strength was 57.25% of the contralateral side. The mean functional score was 26.4 points. Wrist arthroplasty with a FVFHG is a useful option to treat Enneking stage 2 giant cell tumors of the distal radius. We believe that wrist instability is not determined by the choice of laterality of the fibula, which can be minimized by transplanting a short fibula with the anterior tibial artery as a donor artery. The recipient sites can be successfully resurfaced by skin grafting.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2012-09-15", "authors": ["Duke WhanChung", "Chung SooHan", "Jae HoonLee", "Sang GilLee"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22028"}

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with a linear probe (6-9 MHz, LOGIQE9/GE), color coded Doppler sonography (CCDS) and Power Doppler ultrasonography (PD) were performed in all patients preoperatively.

In case of carcinoma morphological characteristics and especially microvascularization were analyzed using time intensity curves (TIC) in selected regions of interest (ROI).\nIn total, 22 thyroid carcinomas could be identified by histology. Using CEUS thyroid carcinomas in 19 patients showed early and irregular arterial vascularization followed by early arterial central wash-out. CCDS/PD, however, revealed irregular peripheral vascularization with low flow only in 8 cases. Further analysis resulted in a significant higher area under the curve (AUC) at the edge than in the tumor center but in a similar time to peak (TTP) in both regions.\nCEUS represents a highly sensitive method for the detection of the microvascularization of thyroid carcinomas.

Mechanisms that stabilize the vascular plexus are not well understood. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a blood-borne lipid mediator implicated in the regulation of vascular and immune systems. Here we describe a mechanism by which the G protein-coupled S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) stabilizes the primary vascular network. A gradient of S1P1 expression from the mature regions of the vascular network to the growing vascular front was observed. In the absence of endothelial S1P1, adherens junctions are destabilized, barrier function is breached, and flow is perturbed, resulting in abnormal vascular hypersprouting. Interestingly, S1P1 responds to S1P as well as laminar shear stress to transduce flow-mediated signaling in endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Multinephron dynamics on the renal vascular network.", "abstract": "Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and the myogenic mechanism combine in each nephron to regulate blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Both mechanisms are nonlinear, generate self-sustained oscillations, and interact as their signals converge on arteriolar smooth muscle, forming a regulatory ensemble. Ensembles may synchronize. Smooth muscle cells in the ensemble depolarize periodically, generating electrical signals that propagate along the vascular network. We developed a mathematical model of a nephron-vascular network, with 16 versions of a single nephron model containing representations of both mechanisms in the regulatory ensemble, to examine the effects of network structure on nephron synchronization. Symmetry, as a property of a network, facilitates synchronization. Nephrons received blood from a symmetric electrically conductive vascular tree. Symmetry was created by using identical nephron models at each of the 16 sites and symmetry breaking by varying nephron length. The symmetric model achieved synchronization of all elements in the network. As little as 1% variation in nephron length caused extensive desynchronization, although synchronization was maintained in small nephron clusters. In-phase synchronization predominated among nephrons separated by one or three vascular nodes and antiphase synchronization for five or seven nodes of separation. Nephron dynamics were irregular and contained low-frequency fluctuations. Results are consistent with simultaneous blood flow measurements in multiple nephrons. An interaction between electrical signals propagated through the network to cause synchronization; variation in vascular pressure at vessel bifurcations was a principal cause of desynchronization. The results suggest that the vasculature supplies blood to nephrons but also engages in robust information transfer.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "A mechanistic compartmental model for total antibody uptake in tumors.", "abstract": "Antibodies are under development to treat a variety of cancers, such as lymphomas, colon, and breast cancer. A major limitation to greater efficacy for this class of drugs is poor distribution in vivo. Localization of antibodies occurs slowly, often in insufficient therapeutic amounts, and distributes heterogeneously throughout the tumor. While the microdistribution around individual vessels is important for many therapies, the total amount of antibody localized in the tumor is paramount for many applications such as imaging, determining the therapeutic index with antibody drug conjugates, and dosing in radioimmunotherapy. With imaging and pretargeted therapeutic strategies, the time course of uptake is critical in determining when to take an image or deliver a secondary reagent. We present here a simple mechanistic model of antibody uptake and retention that captures the major rates that determine the time course of antibody concentration within a tumor including dose, affinity, plasma clearance, target expression, internalization, permeability, and vascularization. Since many of the parameters are known or can be estimated in vitro, this model can approximate the time course of antibody concentration in tumors to aid in experimental design, data interpretation, and strategies to improve localization.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2012-09-15", "authors": ["Greg MThurber", "KDane Wittrup"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.08.034"}
{"title": "Involvement of autophagy in ovarian cancer: a working hypothesis.", "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosomal-driven catabolic process that contributes to preserve cell and tissue homeostases through the regular elimination of damaged, aged and redundant self-constituents. In normal cells, autophagy protects from DNA mutation and carcinogenesis by preventive elimination of pro-oxidative mitochondria and protein aggregates. Mutations in oncogenes and oncosuppressor genes dysregulate autophagy. Up-regulated autophagy may confer chemo- and radio-resistance to cancer cells, and also a pro-survival advantage in cancer cells experiencing oxygen and nutrient shortage. This fact is the rationale for using autophagy inhibitors along with anti-neoplastic therapies. Yet, aberrant hyper-induction of autophagy can lead to cell death, and this phenomenon could also be exploited for cancer therapy. The actual level of autophagy in the cancer cell is greatly affected by vascularization, inflammation, and stromal cell infiltration. In addition, small non-coding microRNAs have recently emerged as important epigenetic modulators of autophagy.

However, it remains to be clarified how the GSC-driven VM makes a significant contribution to tumor vasculature. Here, we investigated 11 cases of glioblastomas and found that most of them consisted of blood-perfused vascular channels that coexpress mural cell markers smooth muscle \u03b1-actin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Flk-1), but not CD31 or VE-cadherin. This microvasculature coexisted with endothelial cell-associated vessels. GSCs derived from patients with glioblastomas developed vigorous mural cell-associated vascular channels but few endothelial cell vessels in orthotopic animal models. Suppression of Flk-1 activity and gene expression abrogated GSC transdifferentiation and vascularization in vitro, and inhibited VM in animal models.

Recent studies however suggest that in some situations these adaptive mechanisms might be overcome, resulting in lethal and sublethal injuries. Perhaps most relevant to this discussion is the finding of intravascular gas and fat emboli in mass-stranded beaked whales. Although the source of the gas emboli has as yet to been ascertained, preliminary findings suggest nitrogen is the primary component. Since nitrogen gas embolus formation in divers is linked to nitrogen saturation, it seems premature to dismiss similar pathogenic mechanisms in breath-hold diving cetaceans. Due to the various anatomical adaptations in cetacean lungs, the pulmonary system is thought of as an unlikely site of significant nitrogen absorption. The accessory sinus system on the ventral head of odontocete cetaceans contains a sizeable volume of air that is exposed to the changing hydrostatic pressures during a dive, and is intimately associated with vasculature potentially capable of absorbing nitrogen through its walls. The source of the fat emboli has also remained elusive. Most mammalian fat deposits are considered poorly vascularized and therefore unlikely sites of intravascular introduction of lipid, although cetacean blubber may not be as poorly vascularized as previously thought. We present new data on the vasculature of air sinuses and acoustic fat bodies in the head of bottlenose dolphins and compare it to published accounts.

Based on the highest amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by human fibroblasts grown on n-BG coatings (0-1.245 mg/cm(2)), decellularized trabecular bone samples (porosity: 43-81%) were coated with n-BG particles. Grown on n-BG particles at a coating density of 0.263 mg/cm(2), human fibroblasts produced 4.3 times more VEGF than on uncoated controls. After 8 weeks of implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, both uncoated and n-BG-coated samples were well infiltrated with newly formed tissue (47-48%) and blood vessels (3-4%). No significant differences were found in cellularization and vascularization between uncoated bone scaffolds and n-BG-coated scaffolds. This finding indicates that the decellularized bone itself may exhibit growth-promoting properties induced by the highly interconnected pore microarchitecture and/or proteins left behind on decellularized scaffolds. Even if we did not find proangiogenic effects in n-BG-coated bone scaffolds, a bioactive coating is considered to be beneficial to impart osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties to decellularized bone. n-BG-coated bone grafts have thus high clinical potential for the regeneration of complex tissue defects given their ability for recellularization and neovascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

METHODS Twenty eyes of 19 patients were randomized to receive intravitreal bevacizumab or sham injection 3 to 7 days before vitrectomy for severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We collected aqueous samples before injection and at the time of vitrectomy and extracted undiluted vitreous samples. RESULTS Five eyes had decreased vascularization of membranes from preinjection to the time of vitrectomy (all in the bevacizumab treatment arm). Median visual acuities were 20/400 in control eyes at baseline and postoperative month 3 (POM3) and 8/200 in the bevacizumab-treated group at baseline and 20/100 at POM3 (P= .30 between control and bevacizumab-treated groups at POM3). All retinas were attached at POM3. Vitreous levels of VEGF were significantly lower in the bevacizumab group than in the control group (P= .03). Vitreous levels of CTGF were slightly lower in the bevacizumab group compared with the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant (P= .38). Levels of CTGF in the aqueous were strongly correlated with CTGF levels in the vitreous of controls (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.95 [P< .001]). CONCLUSIONS Intravitreal bevacizumab injection reduces vitreous levels of VEGF and produces a clinically observable alteration in diabetic fibrovascular membranes. Ocular fluid levels of CTGF are not significantly affected within the week after VEGF inhibition. Retinal reattachment rates and visual acuity are not significantly altered by preoperative intravitreal bevacizumab injection at POM3.

{"title": "Evaluation of changes in the tumor microenvironment after sorafenib therapy by sequential histology and 18F-fluoromisonidazole hypoxia imaging in renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "The mechanistic dissociation of 'tumor starvation' versus 'vascular normalization' following anti-angiogenic therapy is a subject of intense controversy in the field of experimental research. In addition, accurately evaluating changes of the tumor microenvironment after anti-angiogenic therapy is important for optimizing treatment strategy. Sorafenib has considerable anti-angiogenic effects that lead to tumor starvation and induce tumor hypoxia in the highly vascularized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenografts. 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F\u2011FMISO) is a proven hypoxia imaging probe. Thus, to clarify early changes in the tumor microenvironment following anti-angiogenic therapy and whether 18F-FMISO imaging can detect those changes, we evaluated early changes in the tumor microenvironment after sorafenib treatment in an RCC xenograft by sequential histological analysis and 18F-FMISO autoradiography (ARG). A human RCC xenograft (A498) was established in nude mice, for histological studies and ARG, and further assigned to the control and sorafenib-treated groups (80 mg/kg, per\u00a0os). Mice were sacrificed on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the histological study, and on Days 3 and 7 in ARG after sorafenib treatment. Tumor volume was measured every day. 18F-FMISO and pimonidazole were injected intravenously 4 and 2\u00a0h before sacrifice, respectively. Tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically with pimonidazole and CD31. Intratumoral 18F-FMISO distribution was quantified in ARG. Tumor volume did not significantly change on Day 7 after sorafenib treatment. In the histological study, hypoxic fraction significantly increased on Day 2, mean vessel density significantly decreased on Day 1 and necrosis area significantly increased on Day 2 after sorafenib treatment. Intratumoral 18F-FMISO distribution significantly increased on Days 3 (10.2-fold, p<0.01) and 7 (4.1-fold, p<0.01) after sorafenib treatment.

{"title": "BMP-specific SMADs function as novel repressors of PDGFA and modulate its expression in ovarian granulosa cells and tumors.", "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) is frequently upregulated in various cancers and thought to function as a key player in the development and progression of tumor growth by regulating aspects of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which it is upregulated is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of two transcription factors that signal for the bone morphogenetic proteins (Smad1 and Smad5) in ovarian granulosa cells causes metastatic granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) in female mice and phenocopies human juvenile GCTs (JGCTs). Smad1/5 double conditional knockout tumors, as well as human JGCTs, are highly vascularized, hemorrhagic and mitotically active. Expression analysis of these tumors and their metastases revealed a significant upregulation of key proliferation and pro-angiogenic factors such as Pdgfa, Pdgfb and Vegf. We examined whether these genes were direct targets of SMAD1 and SMAD5. Knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in mouse primary granulosa cells and a human GCT-derived cell line (COV434) resulted in upregulation of PDGFA, but not PDGFB nor VEGF. We identified several putative SMAD1/5-binding sites in the PDGFA promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated that SMAD1/5 interact with the PDGFA promoter to regulate its activity. Further, SMAD1/5 antagonize the activity of the transcription factor Sp1, a well-known positive regulator of PDGFA, by inhibiting its occupancy at a key regulatory site on the proximal PDGFA promoter. Collectively, our studies establish that loss of SMAD1/5 leads to upregulation of PDGFA in ovarian granulosa cells, and that a novel regulatory interaction exists between the BR-SMADs and Sp1 in controlling PDGFA expression during granulosa cell tumorigenesis.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2012-09-12", "authors": ["S KTripurani", "R WCook", "K WEldin", "S APangas"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2012.392"}
{"title": "Store-dependent Ca(2+) entry in endothelial progenitor cells as a perspective tool to enhance cell-based therapy and adverse tumour vascularization.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have recently been employed in cell-based therapy (CBT) to promote neovascularization and regeneration of ischemic organs, such as heart and limbs. Furthermore, EPCs may be recruited from bone marrow by growing tumors to drive the angiogenic switch through physical engrafting into the lumen of nascent vessels or paracrine release of pro-angiogenic factors. CBT is hampered by the paucity of EPCs harvested from peripheral blood and suffered from several pitfalls, including the differentiation outcome of transplanted cells and low percentage of engrafted cells. Therefore, CBT will benefit from a better understanding of the signal transduction pathway(s) which govern(s) EPC homing, proliferation and incorporation into injured tissues. At the same time, this information might outline alternative molecular targets to combat tumoral neovascularization. We have recently found that store-operated Ca(2+) entry, a Ca(2+)-permeable membrane pathway that is activated upon depletion of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) pool, is recruited by vascular endothelial growth factor to support proliferation and tubulogenesis in human circulating endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). ECFCs are a subgroup of EPCs that circulate in the peripheral blood of adult individuals and are able to proliferate and differentiate into endothelial cells and form capillary networks in vitro and contribute to neovessel formation in vivo. The present review will discuss the relevance of SOCE to ECFC-based cell therapy and will address the pharmacological inhibition of store-dependent Ca(2+) channels as a promising target for anti-angiogenic treatments.", "journal": "Current medicinal chemistry", "date": "2012-09-12", "authors": ["FMoccia", "SDragoni", "FLodola", "EBonetti", "CBottino", "GGuerra", "ULaforenza", "VRosti", "FTanzi"], "doi": "10.2174/092986712804143240"}

In this study, we have characterized the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors in 33 human vascular anomalies. Analysis with quantitative real-time PCR and gene-specific assays showed higher expression of neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and VEGF-receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) mRNAs in vascular malformations (VascM) as compared to infantile hemangiomas (Hem). In addition, the expression levels of PlGF and VEGF-C mRNA were significantly higher in venous VascM when compared to the other VascM and Hem. Higher expression of NRP2 and VEGFR-3 were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. To further study the importance of NRP2 and VEGFR-3, endothelial cell (EC) cultures were established from vascular anomalies. It was found that NRP2 and VEGFR-3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in some of the VascM ECs as compared to human umbilical vein ECs which were used as control cells in the study. Furthermore, adenoviral delivery of soluble decoy NRP2 prevented the proliferation of ECs isolated from most of the vascular anomalies. Our findings suggest that NRP2 functions as a factor maintaining the pathological vascular network in these anomalies.

Insulin resistance initially causes compensatory islet hyperplasia that progresses to islet disorganization and altered vascularization, inflammation, and, finally, decreased functional \u03b2-cell mass and hyperglycemia. The precise mechanism(s) underlying \u03b2-cell failure remain to be elucidated. In this study, we show that in insulin-resistant high-fat diet-fed mice, the enhanced islet vascularization and inflammation was parallel to an increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF). To elucidate the role of VEGF in these processes, we have genetically engineered \u03b2-cells to overexpress VEGF (in transgenic mice or after adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene transfer). We found that sustained increases in \u03b2-cell VEGF levels led to disorganized, hypervascularized, and fibrotic islets, progressive macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, decreased \u03b2-cell mass, and hyperglycemia with age.

Here, we sought to determine the effect of SPARC on neuroblastoma tumor cell-induced angiogenesis and to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis inhibition. Conditioned medium from SPARC-overexpressed neuroblastoma cells (pSPARC-CM) inhibited endothelial tube formation, cell proliferation, induced programmed cell death and suppressed expression of pro-angiogenic molecules such as VEGF, FGF, PDGF, and MMP-9 in endothelial cells. Further analyses revealed that pSPARC-CM-suppressed expression of growth factors was mediated by inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, and cells cultured on conditioned medium from tumor cells that overexpress both Notch intracellular domain (NICD-CM) and SPARC resumed the pSPARC-CM-suppressed capillary tube formation and growth factor expression in vitro. Further, SPARC overexpression in neuroblastoma cells inhibited neo-vascularization in vivo in a mouse dorsal air sac model. Furthermore, SPARC overexpression-induced endothelial cell death was observed by co-localization studies with TUNEL assay and an endothelial marker, CD31, in xenograft tumor sections from SPARC-overexpressed mice.

Here, we evaluated the functional impact of prevascularization by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in self-organizing EHT. EHT fibers were generated by the self-organization of neonatal rat cardiac cells on a fibrin hydrogel scaffold with or without HUVECs. Contractile function was measured and force-length relationship and rate of force production were assessed. Immunofluorescent studies were used to evaluate arrangement and distribution of HUVECs within the EHT fibers. RT-PCR was used to assess the transcript levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (Hif-1\u03b1). EHT with HUVECs manifested tubule-like structures at the periphery during fiber formation. After fiber formation, HUVECs were heterogeneously located throughout the EHT fiber and human CD31+ tubule-like structures were identified. The expression level of Hif-1\u03b1 did not change with the addition of HUVECs. However, maximal force and rate of force generation were not improved in HUVECs containing EHT as compared to control EHT fibers. The addition of HUVECs may result in sparse microvascularization of EHT. However, this perceived benefit is overshadowed by a significant decrease in contractile function and highlights the need for perfused vascularization strategies in order to generate EHT that approaches clinically relevant dimensions.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2012-09-08", "authors": ["Claus SvaneSondergaard", "RussellWitt", "GrantMathews", "SkenderNajibi", "LisaLe", "TracyClift", "Ming-SingSi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-012-1492-7"}

The chart review included demographics and independent variables including age, ethnicity, weight, sex, presence of coexisting medical conditions, type and duration of surgery performed, examination findings at presentation and diagnosis of alopecia, and outcomes were recorded. Inpatient and outpatient clinic notes, operative reports, and recorded vital signs were also reviewed.\nThree children (2 female, 1 male) were noted to develop postoperative alopecia. The average age at surgery was 13.7 years (range, 12 to 16). There was no significant past medical history, and 2 of 3 patients had obesity as a comorbidity. The type of surgery included: 2 proximal femoral osteotomies with proximal femoral osteoplasties and 1 wide resection of a congenital tibia pseudarthrosis with contralateral vascularized fibular grafting and internal fixation. Mean surgical duration was 5.9 hours (range, 4.4 to 7.1), and no intraoperative episodes of hypotension (<50 mm Hg) or hypothermia (T<35.9\u00b0C) occurred.

However, the etiopathogenesis of pyogenic granuloma is poorly understood and whether pyogenic granuloma being a reactive process or a tumor is unknown. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of laser-captured vessels from pyogenic granuloma and from a richly vascularized tissue, placenta, as well as, from proliferative and involutive hemangiomas. Our study identified a gene signature specific to pyogenic granuloma. In the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) database, this signature was linked to 'white blood cells monocytes'. It also demonstrated high enrichment for gene ontology terms corresponding to 'vasculature development' and 'regulation of blood pressure'. This signature included genes of the nitric oxide pathway alongside genes related to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and vascular injury, three conditions biologically interconnected. Finally, one of the genes specifically associated with pyogenic granuloma was FLT4, a tyrosine-kinase receptor related to pathological angiogenesis. All together, these data advocate for pyogenic granuloma to be a reactive lesion resulting from tissue injury, followed by an impaired wound healing response, during which vascular growth is driven by FLT4 and the nitric oxide pathway.", "journal": "Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc", "date": "2012-09-08", "authors": ["CatherineGodfraind", "Monica LCalicchio", "HarryKozakewich"], "doi": "10.1038/modpathol.2012.148"}

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative embolization on intraoperative blood loss in palliative decompression and instrumented surgery using a posterior approach for spinal metastasis. Between 2000 and 2010, forty-six patients underwent palliative decompression and instrumented surgery using a posterior approach for spinal metastasis in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Preoperative embolization was performed in 23 patients (embolization group), and surgery was performed within 3 days after embolization.

However, the mechanism underlying is poorly understood. Recently, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to play an important role in regulating immune responses to allogeneic antigens. In this study, we explored the role of Tregs in the induction of tolerance in an allogeneic hind limb transplantation model.\nForty-eight Lewis rats were divided into 6 groups. They received isografts and allografts from Brown-Norway hind limbs. Recipients in groups 1 and 2 received isografts and those in the other groups received allografts. The bone components of donor limbs were kept intact in groups 1, 3, and 5 but removed before transplantation into groups 2, 4, and 6. Tapered cyclosporin A (CsA) was administered to recipients in groups 5 and 6 after transplantation. During the 100-day observation period, all isografts survived, but the allografts in groups 3 and 4 were rejected within 8 to 12 days. CsA-treated intact allografts survived rejection-free for more than 100 days, and CsA-treated allografts lacking bone elements were rejected within 2 months. Stable peripheral chimerism and myeloid chimerism were observed in group 5. Declining peripheral chimerism and a lack of myeloid chimerism were observed in group 6. Donor-specific Tregs were exclusively detected in both peripheral blood and in the spleens of long-term recipient rats in group 5, with an increased FoxP3 mRNA expression in the allografts. This was further demonstrated to be responsible for donor-specific hyporeactivity by in vitro one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).\nBone components in the allogeneic hind limbs can induce myeloid chimerism and donor-specific Tregs may be essential to tolerance induction.

{"title": "Characterization of omental immune aggregates during establishment of a latent gammaherpesvirus infection.", "abstract": "Herpesviruses are characterized by their ability to establish lifelong latent infection. The gammaherpesvirus subfamily is distinguished by lymphotropism, establishing and maintaining latent infection predominantly in B lymphocytes. Consequently, gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis is closely linked to normal B cell physiology. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) pathogenesis in laboratory mice has been extensively studied as a model system to gain insights into the nature of gammaherpesvirus infection in B cells and their associated lymphoid compartments. In addition to B cells, MHV68 infection of macrophages contributes significantly to the frequency of viral genome-positive cells in the peritoneal cavity throughout latency. The omentum, a sheet of richly-vascularized adipose tissue, resides in the peritoneal cavity and contains clusters of immune cell aggregates termed milky spots. Although the value of the omentum in surgical wound-healing has long been appreciated, the unique properties of this tissue and its contribution to both innate and adaptive immunity have only recently been recognized. To determine whether the omentum plays a role in gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis we examined this site during early MHV68 infection and long-term latency. Following intraperitoneal infection, immune aggregates within the omentum expanded in size and number and contained virus-infected cells. Notably, a germinal-center B cell population appeared in the omentum of infected animals with earlier kinetics and greater magnitude than that observed in the spleen. Furthermore, the omentum harbored a stable frequency of viral genome-positive cells through early and into long-term latency, while removal of the omentum prior to infection resulted in a slight decrease in the establishment of splenic latency following intraperitoneal infection. These data provide the first evidence that the omentum is a site of chronic MHV68 infection that may contribute to the maintenance of chronic infection.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-09-07", "authors": ["Kathleen SGray", "Christopher MCollins", "Samuel HSpeck"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043196"}

Inadequate uterine receptivity may contribute to the majority of implantation failures. To provide a comprehensive inventory of genes and functional networks that represent the maternal input of the embryo-maternal cross-talk, a longitudinal, holistic study of the endometrial transcriptome in relation to the days of estrous and to the receptivity of the endometrium was performed in bovine. At day 3 of estrous, genes related to cell communication and mitochondrial energy metabolism were differentially expressed among high- and low-receptive endometria (HR, LR); at day 7, transcripts functioning in immune and inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis had different abundances. Additionally, temporal transcriptional changes between days 3 and 7 differed considerably among HR and LR. Further, several transcription factors were predicted as relevant for receptivity because they were either differentially expressed among HR and LR animals or are known to be associated with genes we detected to have differential expression. Finally, global DNA methylation varied according to the interaction of receptivity group and day of estrous, and a divergent trend, which correlated with abundance of DNMT1 transcript, was observed in LR and HR along the estrous cycle days. The study revealed that, even in early estrous, transcripts related to cell communication and response to exogenous stimuli, vascularization, and energy supply show divergent expression and longitudinal temporal regulation in HR and LR.

While low level laser (or light) therapy (LLLT) uses red or near-infrared light alone to reduce inflammation, pain and stimulate tissue repair and regeneration, photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses the combination of light plus non-toxic dyes (called photosensitizers) to produce reactive oxygen species that can kill infectious microorganisms and cancer cells or destroy unwanted tissue (neo-vascularization in the choroid, atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries).

All IS was discontinued on day 11 after BMT.\nCyclosporine A monotherapy prevented acute rejection of KTx or VCA. However, all allografts were rejected after IS withdrawal in KTx or VCA recipients who were conditioned but did not receive BMT. After delayed BMT, mixed chimerism was initially achieved in all KTx or VCA recipients with 200-, 300-, and 400-cGy total body irradiation. Long-term tolerance to KTx or VCA was achieved in most of these recipients with total IS withdrawal. The tolerance achieved with delayed BMT was donor specific as confirmed by acceptance of donor skin and rejection of third-party skin graft.\nIS-free donor-specific tolerance can be successfully induced with delayed BMT to previous recipients of kidney transplantation or VCA.

To test this hypothesis, we used placental explants, primary trophoblast cultures, and placental and serum samples collected from FGR and age-matched control women. Our results show that (1) EG-VEGF increases trophoblast proliferation ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and Ki67-staining) via the homeobox-gene, HLX (2) the proliferative effect involves PROKR1 but not PROKR2, (3) EG-VEGF does not affect syncytium formation (measurement of syncytin 1 and 2 and \u03b2 hCG production) (4) EG-VEGF increases the vascularization of the placental villi and insures their survival, (5) EG-VEGF, PROKR1, and PROKR2 mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in FGR placentas, and (6) EG-VEGF circulating levels are significantly higher in FGR patients. Altogether, our results identify EG-VEGF as a new placental growth factor acting during the first trimester of pregnancy, established its mechanism of action, and provide evidence for its deregulation in FGR.

Vascularization increased over time in both treated and untreated implants, with no statistical significance. Epidermal downgrowth was minimally observed in all implants with or without the BMMSC treatment. Our results suggest that BMMSCs can influence an early and rapid resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in wound healing, and can stimulate early collagen deposition and granulation tissue associated with later stages of wound repair. These findings provide evidence that BMMSCs can stimulate a more rapid and improved barrier between the skin and porous metal percutaneous implant.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2012-09-04", "authors": ["DorthyannIsackson", "Kevin JCook", "Lawrence DMcGill", "Kent NBachus"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2012.08.002"}

This modeling approach is particularly applicable to tissue engineering of artificial livers, where the inherent complexity of the engineered scaffolds prevents the use of computational fluid dynamics. The objectives of this study were to simultaneously predict the experimental parenchymal fluid pressure (PFP) and compression response in a PHVE liver model. The model PFP matched the experimental measurements (318\u2009Pa) to within 1.5%. Linear regression of both phases of compression, ramp, and hold, demonstrated a strong correlation between the model and the experimental reaction force (p<0.5). The ability of this PVE model to accurately predict both fluid and solid behavior is important due to the highly vascularized nature of liver tissue and the mechanosensitivity of liver cells to solid matrix and fluid flow properties.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2012-09-04", "authors": ["Emma CMoran", "SmithaRaghunathan", "Douglas WEvans", "Nicholas AVavalle", "TanyaLeRoith", "Thomas LSmith", "Jessica LSparks"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4007175"}

We here present clinical data of the first nine patients with LSCD who were transplanted with autologous LECs expanded in medium completely free of any animal-derived products and non-human/recombinant growth factors (including Cholera Toxin), and with autologous human serum as the only growth supplement.\nWe conducted a noncomparative retrospective study of patients with LSCD at our centre between 2009 and 2011. The diagnosis was based on history and clinical signs. A biopsy was taken from healthy limbus, and the epithelium was expanded on amniotic membrane (AM) in medium containing autologous serum and subsequently transplanted to the affected eye.\nSuccessful outcome was defined as relief of pain and photophobia and/or improved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and/or reestablishment of a stable corneal epithelium and regression of corneal vascularization. Five of the nine transplanted patients (55.6%) had an improvement in either subjective symptoms or objective findings (11- to 28-month follow-up).\nOur clinical study shows that patients with LSCD can be treated successfully with transplantation of LECs expanded ex vivo in a medium with autologous serum as the only growth supplement.

{"title": "Ultrasound assessment on selected peripheral nerve pathologies. Part I: Entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb - excluding carpal tunnel syndrome.", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is one of the methods for imaging entrapment neuropathies, post-traumatic changes to nerves, nerve tumors and postoperative complications to nerves. This type of examination is becoming more and more popular, not only for economic reasons, but also due to its value in making accurate diagnosis. It provides a very precise assessment of peripheral nerve trunk pathology - both in terms of morphology and localization. During examination there are several options available to the specialist: the making of a dynamic assessment, observation of pain radiation through the application of precise palpation and the comparison of resultant images with the contra lateral limb. Entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb are discussed in this study, with the omission of median nerve neuropathy at the level of the carpal canal, as extensive literature on this subject exists. The following pathologies are presented: pronator teres muscle syndrome, anterior interosseus nerve neuropathy, ulnar nerve groove syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon's canal syndrome, radial nerve neuropathy, posterior interosseous nerve neuropathy, Wartenberg's disease, suprascapular nerve neuropathy and thoracic outlet syndrome. Peripheral nerve examination technique has been presented in previous articles presenting information about peripheral nerve anatomy [Journal of Ultrasonography 2012; 12 (49): 120-163 - Normal and sonographic anatomy of selected peripheral nerves. Part I: Sonohistology and general principles of examination, following the example of the median nerve; Part II: Peripheral nerves of the upper limb; Part III: Peripheral nerves of the lower limb]. In this article potential compression sites of particular nerves are discussed, taking into account pathomechanisms of damage, including predisposing anatomical variants (accessory muscles). The parameters of ultrasound assessment have been established - echogenicity and echostructure, thickness (edema and related increase in the cross sectional area of the nerve trunk), vascularization and the reciprocal relationship with adjacent tissue.\nBadanie ultrasonograficzne jest jedn\u0105 z metod dodatkowych wykorzystywanych w diagnostyce neuropatii uciskowych, uraz\u00f3w i guz\u00f3w nerw\u00f3w, a tak\u017ce w celu oceny powik\u0142a\u0144 pooperacyjnych dotycz\u0105cych nerw\u00f3w.

{"title": "The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis in radiological studies. Part II: Imaging studies in rheumatoid arthritis.", "abstract": "Early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis followed by early initiation of treatment, prevent the destruction of joints and progression to disability in the majority of patients. A traditional X-ray fails to capture early inflammatory changes, while late changes (e.g. erosions) appear after a significant delay, once 20-30% of bone mass has been lost. Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that erosions are seen in the first 3 months from the appearance of symptoms in 10-26% of patients, while in 75% they are seen in the first 2 years of the disease. Power Doppler ultrasound and dynamic magnetic resonance studies allow for qualitative, semiquantitative and quantitative monitoring of the vascularization of the synovium. In addition, magnetic resonance enables assessment of the bone marrow. The ultrasonographic examination using a state-of-the-art apparatus with a high-frequency probe allows for images with great spatial resolution and for the visualization of soft tissues and bone surfaces. However, the changes seen in ultrasonography (synovial pathologies, the presence of exudate, tendons changes, cartilage and bone lesions, pathologies of tendon attachments and ligaments - enthesopathies) are not only specific for rheumatoid arthritis and occur in other rheumatic diseases. Qualitative methods are sufficient for diagnosing the disease through ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Whereas semiquantitative and quantitative scales serve to monitor the disease course - efficacy of conservative treatment and qualification for radioisotope synovectomy or surgical synovectomy - and to assess treatment efficacy.\nWczesne rozpoznanie reumatoidalnego zapalenia staw\u00f3w i wczesne wdro\u017cenie leczenia zapobiega u wi\u0119kszo\u015bci pacjent\u00f3w destrukcji staw\u00f3w i niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015bci.

{"title": "Development and fibronectin signaling requirements of the zebrafish interrenal vessel.", "abstract": "The early morphogenetic steps of zebrafish interrenal tissue, the teleostean counterpart of the mammalian adrenal gland, are modulated by the peri-interrenal angioblasts and blood vessels. While an organized distribution of intra-adrenal vessels and extracellular matrix is essential for the fetal adrenal cortex remodeling, whether and how an intra-interrenal buildup of vasculature and extracellular matrix forms and functions during interrenal organogenesis in teleosts remains unclear.\nWe characterized the process of interrenal gland vascularization by identifying the interrenal vessel (IRV); which develops from the axial artery through angiogenesis and is associated with highly enriched Fibronectin (Fn) accumulation at its microenvironment. The loss of Fn1 by either antisense morpholino (MO) knockdown or genetic mutation inhibited endothelial invasion and migration of the steroidogenic tissue. The accumulation of peri-IRV Fn requires Integrin \u03b15 (Itga5), with its knockdown leading to interrenal and IRV morphologies phenocopying those in the fn1 morphant and mutant. fn1b, another known fn gene in zebrafish, is however not involved in the IRV formation. The distribution pattern of peri-IRV Fn could be modulated by the blood flow, while a lack of which altered angiogenic direction of the IRV as well as its ability to integrate with the steroidogenic tissue. The administration of Fn antagonist through microangiography exerted reducing effects on both interrenal vessel angiogenesis and steroidogenic cell migration.\nThis work is the first to identify the zebrafish IRV and to characterize how its integration into the developing interrenal gland requires the Fn-enriched microenvironment, which leads to the possibility of using the IRV formation as a platform for exploring organ-specific angiogenesis.

{"title": "Expression Profiling of Solute Carrier Gene Families at the Blood-CSF Barrier.", "abstract": "The choroid plexus (CP) is a highly vascularized tissue in the brain ventricles and acts as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB). A main function of the CP is to secrete CSF, which is accomplished by active transport of small ions and water from the blood side to the CSF side. The CP also supplies the brain with certain nutrients, hormones, and metal ions, while removing metabolites and xenobiotics from the CSF. Numerous membrane transporters are expressed in the CP in order to facilitate the solute exchange between the blood and the CSF. The solute carrier (SLC) superfamily represents a major class of transporters in the CP that constitutes the molecular mechanisms for CP function. Recently, we systematically and quantitatively examined Slc gene expression in 20 anatomically comprehensive brain areas in the adult mouse brain using high-quality in situ hybridization data generated by the Allen Brain Atlas. Here we focus our analysis on Slc gene expression at the BCSFB using previously obtained data. Of the 252 Slc genes present in the mouse brain, 202 Slc genes were found at detectable levels in the CP. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the CP Slc gene expression pattern is substantially different from the other 19 analyzed brain regions. The majority of the Slc genes in the CP are expressed at low to moderate levels, whereas 28 Slc genes are present in the CP at the highest levels. These highly expressed Slc genes encode transporters involved in CSF secretion, energy production, and transport of nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters, sulfate, and metal ions.

{"title": "Balancing life with glycoconjugates: monitoring unfolded protein response-mediated anti-angiogenic action of tunicamycin by Raman Spectroscopy.", "abstract": "Asparagine-linked protein glycosylation is a hallmark for glycoprotein structure and function. Its impairment by tunicamycin [a competitive inhibitor of N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphate transferase (GPT)] has been known to inhibit neo-vascularization (i.e., angiogenesis) in humanized breast tumor due to an induction of ER stress-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR). The studies presented here demonstrate that (i) tunicamycin (i) inhibits capillary endothelial cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner; (ii) treated cells are incapable of forming colonies upon its withdrawal; and (iii) tunicamycin treatment causes nuclear fragmentation. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress-mediated UPR event in these cells was studied with the aid of Raman spectroscopy, in particular, the interpretation of bands at 1672, 1684 and 1694 cm(-1), which are characteristics of proteins and originate from C=O stretching vibrations of mono-substituted amides. In tunicamycin-treated cells these bands decreased in area as follows: at 1672 cm(-1) by 41.85% at 3 h and 55.39% at 12 h; at 1684 cm(-1) by 20.63% at 3 h and 40.08% at 12 h; and also at 1994 cm(-1) by 33.33% at 3 h and 32.92% at 12 h, respectively. Thus, in the presence of tunicamycin, newly synthesized protein chains fail to arrange properly into their final secondary and/or tertiary structures, and the random coils they form had undergone further degradation.", "journal": "Pure and applied chemistry.

{"title": "Nontrophoblastic placental tumors.", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate potential influence of placental tumors on fetal outcome. The study comprised 10 cases of placental tumors. The analysis included the sonographic assessment of the tumor, signs of fetal anemia, as well as signs of hemodynamic disturbances or heart failure, and intrauterine treatment. The fetal hemodynamic was examined on the basis of Doppler blood flow in the umbilical artery and vein, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venous. The evaluation of fetal heart included the measurement of heart size, blood flow through cardiac valves and the assessment of fetal heart function based on cardiovascular score. The fetal outcome was also assessed according to birthweight, gestational age at delivery, pH, Ap score at 5th minute, abnormal neurological development and the need of intrauterine therapy. Ten cases of placental tumors were prenatally detected from 1999 to 2011. Among them 7 cases of hypoechogenic, non-vascularized cysts were identified and these neither effected the hemodynamics nor complicated fetal outcome. The vascularized tumors (chorioangioma) were the cause of severe anemia and hemodynamic disturbances and these led to fetal cardiac heart failure. In all cases of vascularized tumors from 2-3 intrauterine transfusion were performed. Rich vascularized tumors (chorioangioma) may cause hemodynamic disturbances and fetal heart failure. This may require intrauterine treatment and may result in abnormal fetal outcome and neurological development.", "journal": "Neuro endocrinology letters", "date": "2012-09-01", "authors": ["MariolaRopacka-Lesiak", "KarolinaGruca-Stryjak", "GrzegorzBreborowicz"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Fragmin/protamine microparticles to adsorb and protect HGF and to function as local HGF carriers in vivo.", "abstract": "The clinical efficacy of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in tissue repair can be greatly enhanced by high affinity, biocompatible drug carriers that maintain the bioactivity and regulate release at the target site. We produced 0.5-3.0 \u03bcm fragmin (low molecular weight heparin)/protamine microparticles (F/P MPs) as carriers for the controlled release of HGF. F/P MPs immobilized more than 3 \u03bcg of HGF per mg of MPs and gradually released the absorbed HGF into the medium with a half-release time of approximately 5 days. Compared with HGF alone, HGF-containing F/P MPs substantially enhanced the mitogenic effect of HGF on cultured human microvascular endothelial cells, by prolonging the biological half-life, and its conjugation to F/P MPs protected HGF from heat and proteolytic inactivation. F/P MPs disappeared 8 days after subcutaneous injection in mice, suggesting that they are rapidly biodegraded. Furthermore, the number of large (diameter \u2265200 \u03bcm or containing \u2265 100 erythrocytes) and medium (diameter 20-200 \u03bcm or containing 10-100 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries 8 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs was significantly higher than that after injection of HGF or F/P MPs alone. Furthermore, the number of small (diameter \u2264 20 \u03bcm or containing 1-10 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries was significantly higher 4 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs. This increased angiogenic activity of HGF in vivo is probably due to both sustained local release and protection against biodegradation by the F/P MPs. Thus, F/P MPs may be useful and safe HGF carriers that facilitate cell proliferation and vascularization at sites of tissue damage.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-09-01", "authors": ["SatokoKishimoto", "MasayukiIshihara", "ShingoNakamura", "MasanoriFujita", "MegumiTakikawa", "YukiSumi", "TomoharuKiyosawa", "ToshinoriSato", "YasuhiroKanatani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.003"}

{"title": "Selective targeting of interferon \u03b3 to stromal fibroblasts and pericytes as a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth.", "abstract": "New approaches to block the function of tumor stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and pericytes is an emerging field in cancer therapeutics as these cells play a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth via paracrine signals. Because of immunomodulatory and other antitumor activities, IFN\u03b3, a pleiotropic cytokine, has been used as an anticancer agent in clinical trials. Unfortunately only modest beneficial effects, but severe side effects, were seen. In this study, we delivered IFN\u03b3 to stromal fibroblasts and pericytes, considering its direct antifibrotic activity, using our platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor (PDGF\u03b2R)-binding carrier (pPB-HSA), as these cells abundantly express PDGF\u03b2R. We chemically conjugated IFN\u03b3 to pPB-HSA using a heterobifunctional PEG linker. In vitro in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, pPB-HSA-IFN\u03b3 conjugate activated IFN\u03b3-signaling (pSTAT1\u03b1) and inhibited their activation and migration. Furthermore, pPB-HSA-IFN\u03b3 inhibited fibroblasts-induced tube formation of H5V endothelial cells. In vivo in B16 tumor-bearing mice, pPB-HSA-IFN\u03b3 rapidly accumulated in tumor stroma and pericytes and significantly inhibited the tumor growth while untargeted IFN\u03b3 and pPB-HSA carrier were ineffective. These antitumor effects of pPB-HSA-IFN\u03b3 were attributed to the inhibition of tumor vascularization, as shown with \u03b1-SMA and CD-31 staining. Moreover, pPB-HSA-IFN\u03b3 induced MHC-II expression specifically in tumors compared with untargeted IFN\u03b3, indicating the specificity of this approach. This study thus shows the impact of drug targeting to tumor stromal cells in cancer therapy as well as provides new opportunities to use cytokines for therapeutic application.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2012-08-31", "authors": ["RuchiBansal", "TusharTomar", "ArneOstman", "KlaasPoelstra", "JaiPrakash"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0758"}

Of the 93 cases, 79 cases were with mandible lesions, 13 cases with maxillary lesions, and 1 case with both mandible and maxillary lesions. Sixty-six cases received one course of radiotherapy, with the radiation doses of 34 - 90 Gy (mean 64.6 Gy). Twenty-two cases experienced tooth extraction or other operative procedures before exhibition of the clinical symptoms for osteoradionecrosis. The interval time between radiotherapy and the onset of osteoradionecrosis varied from 2 weeks to 32 years (mean 54 months).\nOf 93 cases, 56 patients underwent radical resection of the pathologic bone and reconstruction with free tissue flaps, in whom 7 cases received the second surgery due to microvascular thrombosis in flap vessels, and flaps were survival by new vascular anastomosis in 3 cases, the failed flaps were removed and replaced successfully by non vascularized bone grafts in 2 cases, and the failed flaps removed and the defects were repaired with adjacent skin in other 2 cases. In the 56 cases, only one case was with disease recurrence and 53 cases with significant improvement in chewing and swallowing functions. Only 2 of 93 cases underwent resection of the pathologic bone and reconstruction with titanium plates, and thereafter they encountered titanium exposure. Scaling of osteoradionecrosis lesions was applied to 20 of 93 patients and 9 cases of them were with disease recurrence. Fifteen cases had resection of the effected mandible without reconstruction. Disease relapse was encountered in 2 of them, others had poor chewing and swallowing.\nThe mandible is more susceptible to osteoradionecrosis than maxilla.

{"title": "eNOS overexpression exacerbates vascular closure in the obliterative phase of OIR and increases angiogenic drive in the subsequent proliferative stage.", "abstract": "In ischemic retinopathies, the misdirection of reparative angiogenesis away from the hypoxic retina leads to pathologic neovascularization. Thus, therapeutic strategies that reverse this trend would be extremely beneficial. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function facilitating vascular growth and maturation. However, in addition to NO, eNOS can also produce superoxide (O(2)(-)), exacerbating pathology. Here, our aim was to investigate the effect of eNOS overexpression on vascular closure and subsequent recovery of the ischemic retina.\nMice overexpressing eNOS-GFP were subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and changes in retinal vascularization quantified. Background angiogenic drive was assessed during vascular development and in aortic rings. NOS activity was measured by Griess assay or conversion of radiolabeled arginine to citrulline, nitrotyrosine (NT), and superoxide by immunolabeling and dihydroethidium fluorescence and VEGF by ELISA.\nIn response to hyperoxia, enhanced eNOS expression led to increased NOS-derived superoxide and dysfunctional NO production, NT accumulation, and exacerbated vessel closure associated with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\u2084) insufficiency. Despite worse vaso-obliteration, eNOS overexpression resulted in elevated hypoxia-induced angiogenic drive, independent of VEGF production. This correlated with increased vascular branching similar to that observed in isolated aortas and during development. Enhanced recovery was also associated with neovascular tuft formation, which showed defective NO production and increased eNOS-derived superoxide and NT levels.\nIn hyperoxia, reduced BH\u2084 bioavailability causes overexpressed eNOS to become dysfunctional, exacerbating vaso-obliteration. In the proliferative phase, however, eNOS has important prorepair functions enhancing angiogenic growth potential and recovery in ischemia.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2012-08-30", "authors": ["KevinEdgar", "Thomas AGardiner", "Rienvan Haperen", "Rinide Crom", "Denise MMcDonald"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.12-9797"}

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has shown significant improvement in survival in patients with advanced HCC in clinical trials. However, the mechanisms that account for the antiangiogenic efficiency of sorafenib have not been fully elucidated. The present study aims to explore the effect of sorafenib on HIF-1\u03b1 expression and activation in HCC cells and xenografts.\nHCC cells and xenografts were treated with sorafenib or vehicles. Western blotting and quantitative PCR array were used to determine protein and mRNA expression, respectively. HIF-1\u03b1 activity, de novo protein synthesis, and VEGF secretions were determined using assay kits.\nSorafenib dose dependently decreased the hypoxia-induced accumulation and activation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein. Further analysis revealed that such reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 was associated with the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 protein synthesis rather than the promotion of HIF-1\u03b1 protein degradation or the reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of mTOR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p70S6K, RP-S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E were significantly suppressed by sorafenib. In vivo studies further confirmed the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF proteins, leading to a decrease in tumor vascularization and growth of the xenografts.\nSorafenib-mediated inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 synthesis is associated with previously undefined pathways in which mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 and ERK phosphorylation are downregulated.

{"title": "Multi-modal imaging of angiogenesis in a nude rat model of breast cancer bone metastasis using magnetic resonance imaging, volumetric computed tomography and ultrasound.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is an essential feature of cancer growth and metastasis formation. In bone metastasis, angiogenic factors are pivotal for tumor cell proliferation in the bone marrow cavity as well as for interaction of tumor and bone cells resulting in local bone destruction. Our aim was to develop a model of experimental bone metastasis that allows in vivo assessment of angiogenesis in skeletal lesions using non-invasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, we injected 10(5) MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into the superficial epigastric artery, which precludes the growth of metastases in body areas other than the respective hind leg. Following 25-30 days after tumor cell inoculation, site-specific bone metastases develop, restricted to the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal fibula. Morphological and functional aspects of angiogenesis can be investigated longitudinally in bone metastases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), volumetric computed tomography (VCT) and ultrasound (US). MRI displays morphologic information on the soft tissue part of bone metastases that is initially confined to the bone marrow cavity and subsequently exceeds cortical bone while progressing. Using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) functional data including regional blood volume, perfusion and vessel permeability can be obtained and quantified. Bone destruction is captured in high resolution using morphological VCT imaging. Complementary to MRI findings, osteolytic lesions can be located adjacent to sites of intramedullary tumor growth. After contrast agent application, VCT angiography reveals the macrovessel architecture in bone metastases in high resolution, and DCE-VCT enables insight in the microcirculation of these lesions. US is applicable to assess morphological and functional features from skeletal lesions due to local osteolysis of cortical bone. Using B-mode and Doppler techniques, structure and perfusion of the soft tissue metastases can be evaluated, respectively. DCE-US allows for real-time imaging of vascularization in bone metastases after injection of microbubbles. In conclusion, in a model of site-specific breast cancer bone metastases multi-modal imaging techniques including MRI, VCT and US offer complementary information on morphology and functional parameters of angiogenesis in these skeletal lesions.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-08-30", "authors": ["TobiasB\u00e4uerle", "DordeKomljenovic", "Martin RBerger", "WolfhardSemmler"], "doi": "10.3791/4178"}
{"title": "A paradigm shift for soft-tissue coverage of the zones of the abdominal wall using perforator flaps.", "abstract": "A team approach is essential to properly restore the integrity and function of the complete abdominal wall defect. If additional vascularized tissue coverage following this reconstruction is imperative, knowledge of all potential flap alternatives to achieve this goal becomes critical to ensure healing and reduce the risk of recurrent hernia.\nA historical review of algorithms for the management of complex abdominal wall defects was undertaken. Numerous schemas have been suggested as guidelines for flap selection, if needed, and each was carefully scrutinized to determine its contemporary appropriateness.\nThe method for closure of any abdominal wall defect depends on its size, depth, and location. Previous schemas divided the abdomen into subunits with an inventory of available flaps for each region. Traditionally, muscle or musculocutaneous flaps were most commonly suggested. With the advent of perforator flaps, a new set of options is available to augment the possibilities apropos to the specific abdomen zone.\nComplete restoration of even basic function of the abdominal wall requires an intact and contractile musculofascial supporting system. Any incisions or flaps that denervate functioning muscle should be avoided. Perforator flaps have proven to be another reasonable option with which to restore any skin deficiencies whether as pedicled or free flaps and, because by definition no muscle is ever included, maximum function preservation of the abdominal wall will also thereby be achieved.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2012-08-30", "authors": ["Geoffrey GHallock"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31825dc1cc"}

On day 28, external volume expansion increased the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer twofold, consistent with magnetic resonance imaging observations. The proliferation rate in the subcutaneous layer of expansion-treated areas increased twofold, with a net 2.2-fold increase in number of adipocytes in columns; remodeling of the vessels network occurred, with reorientation and increase of vessel diameters shown by corrosion casting and 1.9-fold augmentation of vessels density.\nExternal volume expansion applied to mouse integument induces highly proliferative and vascularized subcutaneous tissue.

{"title": "Improved visualization of lung metastases at single cell resolution in mice by combined in-situ perfusion of lung tissue and X-Gal staining of lacZ-tagged tumor cells.", "abstract": "Metastasis is the main cause of death in the majority of cancer types and consequently a main focus in cancer research. However, the detection of micrometastases by radiologic imaging and the success in their therapeutic eradication remain limited. While animal models have proven to be invaluable tools for cancer research, the monitoring/visualization of micrometastases remains a challenge and inaccurate evaluation of metastatic spread in preclinical studies potentially leads to disappointing results in clinical trials. Consequently, there is great interest in refining the methods to finally allow reproducible and reliable detection of metastases down to the single cell level in normal tissue. The main focus therefore is on techniques, which allow the detection of tumor cells in vivo, like micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), positron emission tomography (PET), bioluminescence or fluorescence imaging. We are currently optimizing these techniques for in vivo monitoring of primary tumor growth and metastasis in different osteosarcoma models. Some of these techniques can also be used for ex vivo analysis of metastasis beside classical methods like qPCR, FACS or different types of histological staining. As a benchmark, we have established in the present study the stable transfection or transduction of tumor cells with the lacZ gene encoding the bacterial enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase that metabolizes the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) to an insoluble indigo blue dye and allows highly sensitive and selective histochemical blue staining of tumor cells in mouse tissue ex vivo down to the single cell level as shown here. This is a low-cost and not equipment-intensive tool, which allows precise validation of metastasis in studies assessing new anticancer therapies. A limiting factor of X-gal staining is the low contrast to e.g. blood-related red staining of well vascularized tissues. In lung tissue this problem can be solved by in-situ lung perfusion, a technique that was recently established by Borsig et al. who perfused the lungs of mice under anesthesia to clear them from blood and to fix and embed them in-situ under inflation through the trachea. This method prevents also the collapse of the lung and thereby maintains the morphology of functional lung alveoli, which improves the quality of the tissue for histological analysis. In the present study, we describe a new protocol, which takes advantage of a combination of X-gal staining of lacZ-expressing tumor cells and in-situ perfusion and fixation of lung tissue. This refined protocol allows high-sensitivity detection of single metastatic cells in the lung and enabled us in a recent study to detect \"dormant\" lung micrometastases in a mouse model, which was originally described to be non-metastatic.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-08-30", "authors": ["Matthias J EArlt", "WalterBorn", "BrunoFuchs"], "doi": "10.3791/4162"}

In seven cases, the sacrificed middle turbinate mucosa was harvested and placed as a free mucosal graft on the septal cartilage. In eight controls, middle turbinate grafting was not performed due to tumor involvement. Septal mucosalization and crusting of all patients was quantified at follow-up appointments. An additional 46 patients were retrospectively identified who received middle turbinate grating on their exposed septal cartilage, and mucosalization rates were determined from clinical records.\nThree weeks after initial operation, the mucosalization rate was 70% versus 5% in the graft and nongraft groups, respectively. At postoperative week 6, the mucosalization and crusting were 97% and 5% for the graft group versus 60% and 85% for the nongraft group. Mucosalization rates in the retrospective graft series agreed with the prospective series.\nDespite donor site morbidity, the nasoseptal flap is becoming the standard of care for skull base reconstruction due to its reliability in reestablishing a barrier between the subarachnoid space and the sinonasal tract.

We have developed a technique that can quickly fabricate (\u223c40 min) such 3D gradients by simultaneously electrospinning polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers, encapsulating gradient amount of bFGF (stabilized by heparin) into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres, and electrospraying the microspheres into PCL fibers. Gradient formation was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Gradients with different steepnesses were obtained by modulating the initial concentration of the bFGF solution. All of the constructs were able to sustainedly release bioactive bFGF over a 28 day period. The release kinetics was dependent on the bFGF loading and steepness of the gradient. In vitro cell migration study demonstrated that bFGF gradients significantly increased the depth of cell migration. To assess the efficacy of bFGF gradients in inducing angiogenesis, we implanted constructs subcutaneously using mouse model. bFGF gradients significantly promoted cell penetration into the constructs. After 10 days of implantation, a high density of mature blood vessels (positive to both CD31 and \u03b1-SMA) were formed in the constructs.

Despite the gathered knowledge regarding the differentiation potential of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs), in what concerns the endothelial lineage many uncertainties are still present. The existence of a cell subpopulation within the human adipose tissue that expresses a SSEA-4 marker, usually associated to pluripotency, raises expectations on the differentiation capacity of these cells (SSEA-4(+)hASCs). In the present study, the endothelial and osteogenic differentiation potential of the SSEA-4(+)hASCs was analyzed, aiming at proposing a single-cell source/subpopulation for the development of vascularized bone TE constructs. SSEA-4(+)hASCs were isolated using immunomagnetic sorting and cultured either in \u03b1-MEM, in EGM-2 MV (endothelial growth medium), or in osteogenic medium. SSEA-4(+)hASCs cultured in EGM-2 MV formed endothelial cell-like colonies characterized by a cobblestone morphology and expression of CD31, CD34, CD105, and von Willebrand factor as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The endothelial phenotype was also confirmed by their ability to incorporate acetylated low-density lipoprotein and to form capillary-like structures when seeded on Matrigel.

{"title": "Contribution of endothelial cells to human bone-derived cells expansion in coculture.", "abstract": "Creating a functional vascularized bone tissue remains one of the main goals of bone tissue engineering. Recently, a growing interest in the crosstalk between endothelial cells (EC) and osteoblasts (OB), the two main players in a new bone formation, has been observed. However, only a few reports have addressed a mutual influence of OB and EC on cell proliferation. Our study focuses on this issue by investigating cocultures of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Three various proportions of cells have been used that is, HBDC:HUVEC 1:1, 1:4, and 4:1 and the cocultures were investigated on day 1, 4, and 7, while HUVEC and HBDC monocultures served as reference. We have detected enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a direct HBDC-HUVEC coculture. This effect was not observed when cells were separated by an insert, which is consistent with other reports on various OB-EC lineages. The appearance of gap-junctions in coculture was confirmed by a positive staining for connexin 43. The number of cells of both phenotypes has been determined by flow cytometry: CD-31-positive cells have been considered EC, while CD-31-negative have been counted as OB. We have observed an over 14-fold increase in OB number after a week in the 1:4 HBDC:HUVEC coculture as compared with less than fourfold in monoculture. The increase in HBDC number in 1:1 coculture has been less pronounced and has reached the value of about sevenfold. These results correspond well with the cell proliferation rate, which has been measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. Moreover, at day 7 EC have been still present in the coculture, which is inconsistent with some other reports. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has revealed the upregulation of ALP and collagen type I genes, but not osteocalcin gene, in all the cocultures grown without pro-osteogenic additives.

The diagnosis of the fractures of the talus can be made on the x-rays, but sometimes real picture of the fracture pattern can be seen only in the CT scans. Ocult fractures such as osteochondral fractures and avascular necrosis can be exactly detected on MRI in aim not to be overlookded as the ankle sprain diagnosis. The precise reduction and stable internal fixation is mandatory in the treatment to enable the anatomical position of the talonavicular, talocrural and subtalar joint and to make possible early motion and rehabilitation, without weight bearing. On the other hand, crushed fractures, open fractures and the Hawkins III-IV fractures with the dislocations of the talar body sometimes needs salvage procedures like Blair or tibio-talar or tibio-calcaneal fusion.", "journal": "Acta chirurgica Iugoslavica", "date": "2012-08-29", "authors": ["Aleksandar RLesi\u0107", "Slavisa GZagorac", "Marko ZBumbasirevi\u0107"], "doi": null}

Tie-1 and Tie-2 are essential for vascular maturation during developmental, physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Angiopoietin 1-4 (Ang-1-4) have been identified as bona fide ligands of the Tie-2 receptor, while Tie-1 remains an orphan receptor which is able to heterodimerize with Tie-2 and to modulate Tie-2 signal transduction. The most exhaustively studied angiopoietins are Ang-1 and Ang-2. Ang-1 is a critical player in vessel maturation and it mediates migration, adhesion and survival of endothelial cells. Ang-2 disrupts the connections between the endothelium and perivascular cells and promotes cell death and vascular regression. Yet, in conjunction with VEGF, Ang-2 promotes neo-vascularization. Hence, angiopoietins exert crucial roles in the angiogenic switch during tumor progression, and increased expression of Ang-2 relative to Ang-1 in tumors correlates with poor prognosis.

They were immersed in equilibration and vitrification solutions containing dimethyl sulphoxide, ethylene glycol and sucrose. A layer of tin foil was rolled over the tissue fragments and the tin foil package was plunged into liquid nitrogen and inserted into a pre-cooled, 0.5-ml straw which was stored in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was also preserved using a needle immersed vitrification (NIV) method, in which tissue fragments transfixed on needles without tin foil and were stored in cryovials filled with liquid nitrogen. Cryopreserved tissue was warmed at room temperature (RT) or 37\u00b0C and the ratio of normal follicles to total visible follicles was determined by histological methods. In addition, cryopreserved and warmed tissue was cultured on the chorioallantoic membranes of fertilized chicken eggs for 5-6 days. The viability and vascularization of the grafts were evaluated. The tissue cryopreserved by NIS and warmed at RT showed comparable follicle morphology to fresh tissue and to that preserved by NIV and warmed at RT.

We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures.As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-08-24", "authors": ["AlexandrosSountoulidis", "AthanasiosStavropoulos", "StavrosGiaglis", "EiriniApostolou", "RuiMonteiro", "Susana MChuva de Sousa Lopes", "HuaiyongChen", "Barry RStripp", "ChristineMummery", "EvangelosAndreakos", "PaschalisSideras"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0041460"}

Intracellular CRT translocation to the cell surface induces immunogenic cell death, suggesting a role in tumor suppression. In this study, we investigated CRT regulation in the serum of patients with AML. We found that CRT is not only exposed by exocytosis on the outer cell membrane after treatment with anthracyclin but also ultimately released to the serum in vitro and in AML patients during induction therapy. Leukemic cells of 113 AML patients showed increased levels of cell-surface CRT (P < .0001) and N-terminus serum CRT (P < .0001) compared with normal myeloid cells. Neutrophil elastase was identified to cleave an N-terminus CRT peptide, which was characterized as vasostatin and blocked ATRA-triggered differentiation. Levels of serum vasostatin in patients with AML inversely correlated with bone marrow vascularization, suggesting a role in antiangiogenesis. Finally, patients with increased vasostatin levels had longer relapse-free survival (P = .04) and specifically benefited from autologous transplantation (P = .006). Our data indicate that vasostatin is released from cell-surface CRT and impairs differentiation of myeloid cells and vascularization of the bone marrow microenvironment.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2012-08-24", "authors": ["SarahMans", "YaraBanz", "Beatrice UMueller", "ThomasPabst"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2012-02-412759"}
{"title": "NK cells are required for costimulatory blockade induced tolerance to vascularized allografts.", "abstract": "The role of natural killer (NK) cells in organ transplantation is poorly understood because studies link these cells to both regulatory and inflammatory functions. NK cells exacerbate inflammation and adaptive immunity under conditions of allograft rejection, but little is known regarding their roles in allograft tolerance. We test the hypothesis that NK cells have regulatory function and promote tolerance induction to murine cardiac allografts.\nMurine hearts were transplanted as fully vascularized heterotopic grafts from BALB/c donors into C57BL/6 recipients. Allograft tolerance was achieved using donor splenocyte transfusion + anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) before transplantation. The requirement for NK cells in tolerance induction was tested by administering anti-NK1.1-depleting mAb or anti-NKG2D-blocking mAb. Intragraft and peripheral immune cell populations were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. CD4 T-cell alloantigen-specific responses and donor-specific alloantibody were also determined.\nNK cell-depleted recipients acutely reject allografts despite anti-CD40L blockade, but rejecting recipients lacked alloantibody and alloantigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses. NK cell depletion resulted in elevated numbers of graft-infiltrating macrophages. NKG2D blockade in tolerized recipients did not cause acute rejection but increased macrophage graft infiltration and increased the expression of NKG2D ligand Rae-1\u03b3 on these cells.\nOur data show that NK cells are required for tolerance induction in recipients given donor splenocyte transfusion + anti-CD40L mAb.

{"title": "Engineering vascularized bone: osteogenic and proangiogenic potential of murine periosteal cells.", "abstract": "One of the key challenges in bone tissue engineering is the timely formation of blood vessels that promote the survival of the implanted cells in the construct. Fracture healing largely depends on the presence of an intact periosteum but it is still unknown whether periosteum-derived cells (PDC) are critical for bone repair only by promoting bone formation or also by inducing neovascularization. We first established a protocol to specifically isolate murine PDC (mPDC) from long bones of adult mice. Mesenchymal stem cells were abundantly present in this cell population as more than 50% of the mPDC expressed mesenchymal markers (CD73, CD90, CD105, and stem cell antigen-1) and the cells exhibited trilineage differentiation potential (chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic). When transplanted on a collagen-calcium phosphate scaffold in vivo, mPDC attracted numerous blood vessels and formed mature bone which comprises a hematopoiesis-supportive stroma. We explored the proangiogenic properties of mPDC using in vitro culture systems and showed that mPDC promote the survival and proliferation of endothelial cells through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Coimplantation with endothelial cells demonstrated that mPDC can enhance vasculogenesis by adapting a pericyte-like phenotype, in addition to their ability to stimulate blood vessel ingrowth from the host. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that periosteal cells contribute to fracture repair, not only through their strong osteogenic potential but also through their proangiogenic features and thus provide an ideal cell source for bone regeneration therapies.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2012-08-23", "authors": ["Nickvan Gastel", "SophieTorrekens", "Scott JRoberts", "KarenMoermans", "JanSchrooten", "PeterCarmeliet", "AernoutLuttun", "Frank PLuyten", "GeertCarmeliet"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.1210"}
{"title": "Functional consequences of cell type-restricted expression of laminin \u03b15 in mouse placental labyrinth and kidney glomerular capillaries.", "abstract": "The labyrinth is the highly vascularized part of the rodent placenta that allows efficient transfer of gases, nutrients, wastes, and other molecules between the maternal and embryonic circulations. These two blood compartments are separated by blastocyst-derived trophoblasts and endothelial cells with an intervening basement membrane that contains laminin and other typical basement membrane components. Previously we reported that the labyrinth of laminin \u03b15 knockout (LM\u03b15-/-) embryos exhibits reduced vascularization and detachment of endothelial cells from the basement membrane, which normally contains LM\u03b15. As very little is known about the origin of this vascular basement membrane, we investigated the cellular requirements for LM\u03b15 expression in the mouse placental labyrinth. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RT-PCR we confirmed that both endothelial cells and trophoblasts normally express LM\u03b15. Using Cre-loxP technology and doxycycline-mediated gene expression, we generated genetically mosaic placentas in which either the trophoblasts or the endothelial cells, but not both, expressed LM\u03b15. We found that the overall architecture of the labyrinth was normal as long as one of these two cell types expressed LM\u03b15, even if it was transgene-derived human laminin \u03b15. These results suggest that laminin trimers containing \u03b15 that are synthesized and secreted by endothelium or by trophoblasts are capable of integrating into the basement membrane and promoting normal vascularization of the placenta.

BPD can be attributed to the dysregulation of normal lung development due to ventilation and oxygen toxicity, resulting in pathologic complications of impaired alveolarization and vascularization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and are implicated in diverse biological processes and diseases. The objectives of this study are to identify the changed miRNAs and their target genes in neonatal rat lungs in response to hyperoxia exposure. Using miRNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses, we found downregulation of five miRNAs, miR-342, miR-335, miR-150, miR-126*, and miR-151*, and upregulation of two miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-34a. Some of these miRNAs had the highest expression during embryonic and early postnatal development. DNA microarray analysis yielded several genes with conserved binding sites for these altered miRNAs. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB) was experimentally verified as a target of miR-150. In summary, we identified seven miRNAs that were changed in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal lungs.

In this study, we show that doxycycline-dependent Wnt1 expression in subcutaneous and intracranial mouse glioma models induced endothelial Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and led to diminished tumor growth, reduced vascular density, and normalized vessels with increased mural cell attachment. These findings were corroborated in GL261 glioma cells intracranially transplanted in mice expressing dominant-active \u03b2-catenin specifically in the endothelium. Enforced endothelial \u03b2-catenin signaling restored BBB characteristics, whereas inhibition by Dkk1 (Dickkopf-1) had opposing effects. By overactivating the Wnt pathway, we induced the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-Dll4/Notch signaling cascade in tumor endothelia, blocking an angiogenic and favoring a quiescent vascular phenotype, indicated by induction of stalk cell genes. We show that \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity directly regulated endothelial expression of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), leading to mural cell recruitment thereby contributing to vascular quiescence and barrier function.

{"title": "Functional Human Vascular Network Generated in Photocrosslinkable Gelatin Methacrylate Hydrogels.", "abstract": "The generation of functional, 3D vascular networks is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of many future tissue engineering-based therapies. Current approaches in vascular network bioengineering are largely carried out using natural hydrogels as embedding scaffolds. However, most natural hydrogels present a poor mechanical stability and a suboptimal durability, which are critical limitations that hamper their widespread applicability. The search for improved hydrogels has become a priority in tissue engineering research. Here, the suitability of a photopolymerizable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel to support human progenitor cell-based formation of vascular networks is demonstrated. Using GelMA as the embedding scaffold, it is shown that 3D constructs containing human blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) generate extensive capillary-like networks in vitro. These vascular structures contain distinct lumens that are formed by the fusion of ECFC intracellular vacuoles in a process of vascular morphogenesis. The process of vascular network formation is dependent on the presence of MSCs, which differentiate into perivascular cells occupying abluminal positions within the network. Importantly, it is shown that implantation of cell-laden GelMA hydrogels into immunodeficient mice results in a rapid formation of functional anastomoses between the bioengineered human vascular network and the mouse vasculature. Furthermore, it is shown that the degree of methacrylation of the GelMA can be used to modulate the cellular behavior and the extent of vascular network formation both in vitro and in vivo.

The complexity of calcium signaling and related cell machinery can be investigated by the use of experimental strategies, as well as by computational approaches. Vascular endothelium is a fascinating model to study the specific properties and roles of calcium signals at multiple biological levels. During the past 20 years, live cell imaging, patch clamp and other techniques have allowed us to detect and interfere with calcium signaling in endothelial cells (ECs), providing a huge amount of information on the regulation of vascularization (angiogenesis) in normal and tumoral tissues. These data range from the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium within different cell microcompartments to those in entire multicellular and organized EC networks. Beside experimental strategies, in silico endothelial models, specifically designed for simulating calcium signaling, are contributing to our knowledge of vascular physiology and pathology. They help to investigate and predict the quantitative features of proangiogenic events moving through subcellular, cellular and supracellular levels. This review focuses on some recent developments of computational approaches for proangiogenic endothelial calcium signaling.

To this end, we explored the potential of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) as a single-cell source for osteogenic and endothelial differentiation and the assembly of bone and vascular compartments within the same scaffold. hASCs were encapsulated in fibrin hydrogel as an angioinductive material for vascular formation, combined with a porous silk fibroin sponge to support osteogenesis, and subjected to sequential application of growth factors. Three strategies were evaluated by changing spatiotemporal cues: (a) induction of osteogenesis prior to vasculogenesis; (b) induction of vasculogenesis prior to osteogenesis; or (c) simultaneous induction of osteogenesis and vasculogenesis. By 5 weeks of culture, bone-like tissue development was evidenced by the deposition of bone matrix proteins, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, along with the formation of vascular networks, evidenced by endothelial cell surface markers, such as CD31 and von Willebrand factor, and morphometric analysis.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been reported to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, thereby enhancing their aggressiveness and stem-like properties. As CAFs are able to recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to tumor site, we aim to investigate their interplay for prostate carcinoma progression. Both prostate CAFs and cancer cells actively recruit EPCs, known to affect tumor progression through increased vasculogenesis. EPCs synergize with CAFs to further promote epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells, through a mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition. Indeed, after fibroblasts have engaged epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, a further shift towards amoeboid motility is promoted by EPCs through contact-mediated triggering of the bidirectional ephrinA1/EphA2 signaling. The activation of ephrinA1 reverse pathway enhances EPC-induced neo-vascularization, thus promoting tumor growth, while EphA2 forward signaling elicits mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in cancer cells, favoring their adhesion to endothelium, transendothelial migration, and lung metastatic colonization.

{"title": "Genetic ablation of cyclooxygenase-2 in keratinocytes produces a cell-autonomous defect in tumor formation.", "abstract": "Using a mouse skin tumor model, we reported previously that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) deficiency reduced papilloma formation. However, this model did not differentiate between the effects of systemic COX-2-deficiency and keratinocyte-specific COX-2 deficiency on tumor formation. To determine whether keratinocyte-specific COX-2 deficiency reduced papilloma formation, v-H-ras-transformed COX-2+/+ and COX-2-/- keratinocytes were grafted onto nude mice and tumor development was compared. Transformed COX-2+/+ and COX-2-/- keratinocytes expressed similar levels of H-ras, epidermal growth factor receptor and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in vitro; and COX-2-deficiency did not reduce uninfected or v-H-ras infected keratinocyte replication. In contrast, tumors arising from grafted transformed COX-2+/+ and COX-2-/- keratinocytes expressed similar levels of H-ras, but COX-2 deficiency reduced phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and epidermal growth factor receptor levels 50-60% and tumor volume by 80% at 3 weeks. Two factors appeared to account for the reduced papilloma size. First, papillomas derived from COX-2-/- keratinocytes showed about 70% decreased proliferation, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, compared with papillomas derived from COX-2+/+ keratinocytes. Second, keratin 1 immunostaining of papillomas indicated that COX-2-/- keratinocytes prematurely initiated terminal differentiation. Differences in the levels of apoptosis and vascularization did not appear to be contributing factors as their levels were similar in tumors derived from COX-2-/- and COX-2+/+ keratinocytes. Overall, the data are in agreement with our previous observations that decreased papilloma number and size on COX-2-/- mice resulted from reduced keratinocyte proliferation and accelerated keratinocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the data indicate that deficiency/inhibition of COX-2 in the initiated keratinocyte is an important determinant of papilloma forming ability.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2012-08-21", "authors": ["Huei-ChenLao", "Jacqueline KAkunda", "Kyung-SooChun", "Gordon PFlake", "Stuart HYuspa", "RobertLangenbach"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgs267"}
{"title": "A case of severe airbag related ocular alkali injury.", "abstract": "While airbags have saved many lives and are clearly beneficial overall, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) powder produced by the inflation reaction can cause significant alkali ocular injury if not irrigated promptly. Here we report a case of severe airbag related ocular alkali injury as a way to bring attention to the need for prompt ocular irrigation following motor vehicle accidents (MVA) with airbag deployment. A 47-year-old man was involved in a MVA with airbag deployment in a rural setting. Attention was paid to several other life-threatening traumatic injuries, however, ocular irrigation was not performed until some 6-7 hours after the MVA. Over the course of 6 months, airbag related alkali injury caused severe limbal ischemia, conjunctivalization of the cornea, corneal epithelial defects, cicatricial scarring, haze, and corneal/limbal vascularization despite amniotic membrane graft. Awareness of the importance of ocular irrigation following airbag deployment must be raised both in the ophthalmology and emergency medicine communities.", "journal": "Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health", "date": "2012-08-18", "authors": ["Shawn SBarnes", "WilliamWong", "John CAffeldt"], "doi": null}

In this work, we investigate the effects of safranal, a component of saffron stigmas, in attenuating retinal degeneration in the P23H rat model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. We demonstrate that administration of safranal to homozygous P23H line-3 rats preserves both photoreceptor morphology and number. Electroretinographic recordings showed higher a- and b-wave amplitudes under both photopic and scotopic conditions in safranal-treated versus non-treated animals. Furthermore, the capillary network in safranal-treated animals was preserved, unlike that found in untreated animals. Our findings indicate that dietary supplementation with safranal slows photoreceptor cell degeneration and ameliorates the loss of retinal function and vascular network disruption in P23H rats.

{"title": "Pyruvate uptake is increased in highly invasive ovarian cancer cells under anoikis conditions for anaplerosis, mitochondrial function, and migration.", "abstract": "Anoikis resistance, or the ability for cells to live detached from the extracellular matrix, is a property of epithelial cancers. The \"Warburg effect,\" or the preference of cancer cells for glycolysis for their energy production even in the presence of oxygen, has been shown to be evident in various tumors. Since a cancer cell's metastatic ability depends on microenvironmental conditions (nutrients, stromal cells, and vascularization) and is highly variable for different organs, their cellular metabolic fluxes and nutrient demand may show considerable differences. Moreover, a cancer cell's metastatic ability, which is dependent on the stage of cancer, may further create metabolic alterations depending on its microenvironment. Although recent studies have aimed to elucidate cancer cell metabolism under detached conditions, the nutrient demand and metabolic activity of cancer cells under nonadherent conditions remain poorly understood. Additionally, less is known about metabolic alterations in ovarian cancer cells with varying invasive capability under anoikis conditions. We hypothesized that the metabolism of highly invasive ovarian cancer cells in detachment would differ from less invasive ovarian cancer cells and that ovarian cancer cells will have altered metabolism in detached vs. attached conditions. To assess these metabolic differences, we integrated a secretomics-based metabolic footprinting (MFP) approach with mitochondrial bioenergetics. Interestingly, MFP revealed higher pyruvate uptake and oxygen consumption in more invasive ovarian cancer cells than their less invasive counterparts. Furthermore, ATP production was higher in more invasive vs. less invasive ovarian cancer cells in detachment. We found that pyruvate has an effect on highly invasive ovarian cancer cells' migration ability. Our results are the first to demonstrate that higher mitochondrial activity is related to higher ovarian cancer invasiveness under detached conditions. Importantly, our results bring insights regarding the metabolism of cancer cells under nonadherent conditions and could lead to the development of therapies for modulating cancer cell invasiveness.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The crucial requirements of a tissue-engineered bladder are bladder smooth muscle regeneration and vascularization. In this study, partial rabbit bladder (4\u00d75\u2009cm) was removed and replaced with a porcine bladder acellular matrix (BAM) that was equal in size. BAM was incorporated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the experimental group while with no bioactive factors in the control group. The bladder tissue strip contractility in the experimental rabbits was better than that in the control ones postoperation. Histological evaluation revealed that smooth muscle regeneration and vascularization in the experimental group were significantly improved compared with those in the control group (p<0.05), while multilayered urothelium was formed in both groups. Muscle strip contractility of neobladder in the experimental group exhibited significantly better than that in the control (p<0.05) assessed with electrical field stimulation and carbachol interference. The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in the native bladder tissue around tissue-engineered neobladder in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control (p<0.05). This work suggests that smooth muscle regeneration and vascularization in tissue-engineered neobladder and recovery of bladder function could be enhanced by PDGF-BB and VEGF incorporated within BAM, which promoted the upregulation of the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of native bladder tissue around the tissue-engineered neobladder.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Optical coherence tomographic imaging of sub-retinal pigment epithelium lipid.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe an optical coherence tomographic finding of layered hyperreflective bands beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the so-called onion sign believed to represent lipid within a vascularized pigment epithelial detachment. METHODS This retrospective observational case series involved reviewing clinical histories of patients with the onion sign. Imaging studies analyzed included spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, color and red-free photographs, near infrared reflectance, fundus autofluorescence, and blue-light fundus autofluorescence. RESULTS A total of 22 eyes of 20 patients with sub-RPE hyperreflective bands were identified. There were 15 women and 5 men with a mean patient age of 76 years (range, 60-92 years). Snellen best-corrected visual acuities ranged from 20/25 to counting fingers, with a median of 20/80. Two patients had bilateral involvement, and 3 of 17 eyes had multifocal onion signs in the same eye. All eyes had neovascular age-related macular degeneration, with type 1 (sub-RPE) neovascularization. In all patients, the onion sign correlated with areas of yellow-gray exudates seen clinically that appeared bright on red-free and near infrared reflectance imaging. No specific fundus autofluorescence or blue-light fundus autofluorescence pattern was identified. CONCLUSIONS The onion sign refers to layered hyperreflective bands in the sub-RPE space usually associated with chronic exudation from type 1 neovascularization in patients with age-related macular degeneration. With an associated bright near infrared reflectance, these bands may correspond to lipid, collagen, or fibrin. Because the onion sign colocalizes to areas of exudation that are known to consist of lipoprotein, we propose that this finding may represent layers of precipitated lipid in the sub-RPE space. To our knowledge, this is the first report of lipid detected in the sub-RPE space on clinical examination.", "journal": "Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)", "date": "2012-08-16", "authors": ["Sri KrishnaMukkamala", "Rogerio ACosta", "AdrianFung", "DavidSarraf", "RobertoGallego-Pinazo", "K BaileyFreund"], "doi": "10.1001/archophthalmol.2012.2491"}

The deep cervical arteries were found to be located lateral to the C3 to C6 vertebrae, vulnerable to damage with the posterior approach. In the thoracic region, the superior and posterior intercostal arteries consistently supplied the spinal muscles. In all specimens, two small anastomotic vessels posterior to the laminae were found connecting the intercostal artery perforators.

Several flap techniques, such as the vertical rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap and the gracilis flap, have been reported. However, flap-specific complications have been documented. Instead of harvesting the myocutaneous flap from the abdomen or legs, our group has proposed a colonic flap for neovaginal reconstruction especially for rectal cancer with vaginal invasion. Nevertheless, the application of a colonic flap for individuals needing only vascularized tissue to fill up the pelvic dead space is problematic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate this novel technique.\nThere were eight patients: three rectal cancers, one vulvar cancer with synchronous rectal cancer, one malignant nerve sheath tumor, one cervical cancer, one prostate cancer, and one rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The operations included four total pelvic exenterations, three total pelvic exenterations with S3-sacrectomy, and one total pelvic exenteration with S3-sacrectomy and left nephrectomy. A colonic flap from which the mucosa was removed was used for immediate pelvic reconstruction in all patients. The flap detail involved harvesting the segment of sigmoid colon with low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery, spatulation of the antimesenteric side of the flap, and mucosectomy. The flap was sutured to the pelvic sidewall with the mucosa-removed surface facing toward the pelvic defect.\nThere were no intraoperative complications, and free surgical margins were achieved. Two patients developed a fluid collection, which was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Perineal wound complications were not found.

{"title": "Plasma membrane-derived microvesicles released from tip endothelial cells during vascular sprouting.", "abstract": "During human foetal brain vascularization, activated CD31+/CD105+ endothelial cells are characterized by the emission of filopodial processes which also decorate the advancing tip of the vascular sprout. Together with filopodia, both the markers also reveal a number of plasma membrane-derived microvesicles (MVs) which are concentrated around the tip cell tuft of processes. At this site, MVs appear in tight contact with endothelial filopodia and follow these long processes, advancing into the surrounding neuropil to a possible cell target. These observations suggest that, like shedding vesicles of many other cell types that deliver signalling molecules and play a role in cell-to-cell communication, MVs sent out from endothelial tip cells could be involved in tip cell guidance and/or act on target cells, regulating cell-to-cell mutual recognition during vessel sprouting and final anastomosis. The results also suggest a new role for tip cell filopodia as conveyor processes for transporting MVs far from the cell of origin in a controlled microenvironment. Additional studies focused on the identification of MV content are needed to ultimately clarify the significance of tip cell MVs during human brain vascularization.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2012-08-14", "authors": ["DanielaVirgintino", "MarcoRizzi", "MariellaErrede", "MaurizioStrippoli", "FrancescoGirolamo", "MirellaBertossi", "LuisaRoncali"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-012-9292-y\n10.1038/nri2567\n10.4161/org.7.2.15782\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226456\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.05.001\n10.1182/blood-2007-03-078709\n10.1007/s10456-011-9241-1\n10.1002/ijc.26217\n10.1073/pnas.1104261108\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64887-0\n10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80081-7\n10.1038/nature04478\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07174.x\n10.1007/978-3-642-67432-7_1\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000549\n10.1016/j.tcb.2008.11.003\n10.1093/cvr/cvp332\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.11.021\n10.1083/jcb.200302047"}
{"title": "Assessment of brain glucose metabolism with input function determined from brain PET images by means of Bayesian ICA and MCMC methods.", "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has the capability to produce regional or parametric images of physiological aspects in a tissue of interest. Apart from the acquired PET data, the concentration of the radiotracer supplied to the tissue through the vascularization has to be known as the input function (IF). IF can be obtained by manual or automatic blood sampling and cross calibrated with PET. These procedures are cumbersome, invasive and generate uncertainties. In the present work, we determine IF from internal artery in fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) brain images by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on Bayesian theory and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling method (BICA, Bayesian ICA). Dynamic brain images were decomposed with BICA into image sequences of blood and tissue components. A region of interest was drawn around the internal artery in the blood image to determine BICA-IF. BICA-IF was therefore corrected for spillover of radioactivity emission from tissue, then it was normalized with three plasma samples to correct for partial volume and blood to plasma radioactivity ratio. BICA-IF was found comparable to IF determined by blood sampling, and rCMRG values in several brain structures obtained with BICA-IF and sampled IF showed a bias of 6.4% which was attributed to the difference in the time sampling of 4s for sampled IF versus 15 s for BICA-MC-IF at early times. In conclusion, BICA is a strong approach in image decomposition to extract blood curves in a noninvasive way.", "journal": "Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society", "date": "2012-08-14", "authors": ["KhadidjaBerradja", "NabilBoughanmi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compmedimag.2012.07.002"}

By exposing litters of C57Bl/6N mice to 75% oxygen from postnatal day 7 (P7) until postnatal day 11 (P11) and then returning them to normoxic conditions, retinal ischemia and subsequent neovascularization on the retinal surface were induced. Retinae were dissected on P9, P11, P12-P14, P16 and P20, and the concentrations of SN, SP, NPY and VEGF determined by radioimmunoassay or ELISA. The levels of SN and SP increased in controls from P9 until P16 and from P9 until P14, respectively, whereas the levels of NPY were high at P9 and decreased thereafter until P20, suggesting that NPY may participate in the development of the retina. However, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) and the NPY-Y2 receptor were not detectable in the immature retina indicating that NPY is not involved in the physiological vascularization in the retina. Compared to controls, OIR had no effect on the levels of SN, whereas levels of both SP and NPY slightly decreased during hyperoxia. Normalization of the levels of SP, and to a more pronounced extent of NPY, was significantly delayed during relative hypoxia. This clearly indicates that these three neuropeptides are not involved in the pathogenesis of neovascularization in OIR. Moreover, since there were no differences in the expression of two vessel markers in the retina of NPY knockout mice versus controls at P14, NPY is also not involved in the delayed development of the intermediate and deep vascular plexus in the retina in this animal model.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2012-08-14", "authors": ["EduardSchmid", "MarinaNogalo", "Nikolaos EBechrakis", "ReinerFischer-Colbrie", "RamonTasan", "G\u00fcntherSperk", "MarkusTheurl", "Arno G EBeer", "RudolfKirchmair", "HerbertHerzog", "JosefTroger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2012.07.024"}

The efficacy of donor ECDI-SPs in protecting vascularized cardiac allografts and mechanism(s) of protection are unknown. In this study, we show that infusions of ECDI-SPs significantly prolong cardiac allograft survival concomitant with an impressive accumulation of CD11b(+) IDO(+) cells in the cardiac allograft, and that the presence of this population is dependent on Gr1(+) cells. Consequently, depletion of Gr1(+) cells or inhibition of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) activity abrogates graft protection by ECDI-SPs infusions. In addition, T cells from ECDI-SPs treated recipients secrete high levels of interleukin 10 and interleukin 13 upon in vitro restimulation, which are also dampened in recipients treated with the IDO inhibitor. Furthermore, combination of donor ECDI-SPs with a short course of rapamycin provides indefinite cardiac allograft survival in 100% of the recipients.

In the present study, tendon and muscle alterations were assessed after experimental tendon lesion of the Infraspinatus muscle in young rats. The consequences of lesions differed on the basis of both extension and injured tissue vascularization, that is apoptosis and/or degeneration, differing mainly by energy demands: apoptosis requires high energy levels (proportional to vascular supply), but degeneration does not. It is well known that tendons are poorly supplied with blood compared with muscular masses, which are abundantly vascularized. Five weeks after tendon surgical section, tendon/muscle samples were taken for TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy. The structural results reported here identified different tendon/muscle alterations: degeneration of tendon without signs of apoptosis, and atrophy of muscle fibers due only to apoptosis. This led to the formulation of the following hypothetical sequence of events: a tendon lesion, not recovering quickly due to the poor tendon blood supply, results in degeneration of the injured tendon, which, in turn, induces a partial disuse of the muscle mass, which consequently atrophies (proportionally to the severity of tendon lesion) by striated muscular fiber apoptosis.

{"title": "Granulocytes and vascularization regulate uterine bleeding and tissue remodeling in a mouse menstruation model.", "abstract": "Menstruation-associated disorders negatively interfere with the quality of life of many women. However, mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of menstrual disorders remain poorly investigated up to date. Among others, this is based on a lack of appropriate pre-clinical animal models. We here employ a mouse menstruation model induced by priming mice with gonadal hormones and application of a physical stimulus into the uterus followed by progesterone removal. As in women, these events are accompanied by menstrual-like bleeding and tissue remodeling processes, i.e. disintegration of decidualized endometrium, as well as subsequent repair. We demonstrate that the onset of bleeding coincides with strong upregulation of inflammatory mediators and massive granulocyte influx into the uterus. Uterine granulocytes play a central role in regulating local tissue remodeling since depletion of these cells results in dysregulated expression of matrix modifying enzymes. As described here for the first time, uterine blood loss can be quantified by help of tampon-like cotton pads. Using this novel technique, we reveal that blood loss is strongly reduced upon inhibition of endometrial vascularization and thus, is a key regulator of menstrual bleeding. Taken together, we here identify angiogenesis and infiltrating granulocytes as critical determinants of uterine bleeding and tissue remodeling in a mouse menstruation model. Importantly, our study provides a technical and scientific basis allowing quantification of uterine blood loss in mice and thus, assessment of therapeutic intervention, proving great potential for future use in basic research and drug discovery.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-08-11", "authors": ["AstridMenning", "AlexanderWalter", "MarionRudolph", "IsabellaGashaw", "Karl-HeinrichFritzemeier", "LarsRoese"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0041800"}

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and contact angle measurement were employed for characterization of surface modifications. The peptide density on PET surfaces was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The surfaces immobilized with peptides were exposed to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to study their specific effects onto EC functions. The results showed that the surface functionalized by these peptides enhanced the EC adhesion, spreading and migration as compared with native PET surfaces. Specifically, the RGDS peptides induced more cell adhesion than other peptides. The YIGSR and SVVYGLR sequences induced more cell spreading and cell migration, represented by intense focal adhesion at the leading edges of cell spreading and migration. The bi-functionalization of RGDS and SVVYGLR peptides (MIX) combined the advantages of both peptides and induced significant EC adhesion, spreading and migration.

Since current treatment options including surgical resection and liver transplantation offer limited therapeutic benefits, there exists a need to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies for the amelioration of HCC. Hepatic tumors are highly vascularized, possessing a rich network of blood vessels and capillaries and there exist an angiogenic component to the tumor growth observed in HCC. Thus, anti-angiogenic therapy has been suggested to possess tremendous therapeutic potential in the treatment of HCC. The process of angiogenesis involves multiple biochemical checkpoints and signaling steps, and thus providing a multitude of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we highlight the role of angiogenesis and its use as a therapeutic strategy for HCC. The first part of the article reviews the angiogenic mechanisms with particular emphasis on the multitude of biochemical factors, such as receptors, enzymes and cytokines involved in the complex interplay of new capillary growth. Next, we present the pre-clinical studies which elucidate the anti-angiogenic effects of both dietary and non-dietary agents in animal models of HCC. Of particular interest is the examination of the effects of the antiangiogenic agents on the various angiogenic markers in the hepatic tissue of the animal challenged either with a hepatocarcinogen or xenografted with hepatic neoplastic cells.

{"title": "Whole animal perfusion fixation for rodents.", "abstract": "The goal of fixation is to rapidly and uniformly preserve tissue in a life-like state. While placing tissue directly in fixative works well for small pieces of tissue, larger specimens like the intact brain pose a problem for immersion fixation because the fixative does not reach all regions of the tissue at the same rate (5,7). Often, changes in response to hypoxia begin before the tissue can be preserved (12). The advantage of directly perfusing fixative through the circulatory system is that the chemical can quickly reach every corner of the organism using the natural vascular network. In order to utilize the circulatory system most effectively, care must be taken to match physiological pressures (3). It is important to note that physiological pressures are dependent on the species used. Techniques for perfusion fixation vary depending on the tissue to be fixed and how the tissue will be processed following fixation.

{"title": "Human adipose-derived stem cells enhance the angiogenic potential of endothelial progenitor cells, but not of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.", "abstract": "One of the current challenges in the field of adipose tissue engineering is to promote sufficient vascularization to prevent cell death and to support adipose tissue formation. Thus, a novel strategy to enhance neovascularization of tissue-engineered adipose tissue might be the coimplantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, no knowledge is given about the cellular interaction in vitro of human ASCs derived from subcutaneous fat tissue and EPCs derived from human peripheral blood. In this study, the first aim was to characterize ASCs and EPCs. Secondly, the two-dimensional Matrigel assay and the three-dimensional spheroid sprouting assay were applied for analyzing the ASC-EPC interaction in regard to formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs by ASC-conditioned medium (CM) or coculture of both cell types and compared to cocultures of ASCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). ASC-CM had no influence on the formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs. However, coculture with ASCs significantly enhanced the formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs; an effect that was not observed in cocultures of ASCs with HUVECs. Importantly, this increase in capillary-like structure formation by EPCs due to cell-cell contact was associated with significantly increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and VEGF-A mRNA expression, while inhibition of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases completely abolished this effect.

Fourteen patients developed vesicovaginal and five developed ureterovaginal fistula. Urethrocystoscopy was sufficient for the diagnosis in nearly 50% of the patients and when combined with methylene blue instillation 90% of all fistulae were found. Several patients sought medical advice due to vaginal leakage following gynaecological surgery without the doctor suspecting a fistula, and for these patients the diagnosis was delayed. Eighteen patients were operated on with an abdominal approach and one with a vaginal approach, in all cases a minimum of 3 months after primary surgery. The reconstruction technique included the interposition of vascularized tissue. None of the patients reported leakage or relapse at follow-up after fistula repair.\nHysterectomy was the most common cause behind the formation of urovaginal fistulae. Misinterpretation of symptoms after gynaecological surgery was common even in cases where the symptoms were indicative of a urovaginal fistula. Delayed fistula repair after a minimum of 3 months, via the abdominal route and with the interposition of vascularized tissue, yielded an excellent final outcome.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of urology", "date": "2012-08-09", "authors": ["UmitDemirci", "MagnusFall", "SofiaG\u00f6the", "JohanStranne", "RalphPeeker"], "doi": "10.3109/00365599.2012.711772"}

Two readers evaluated the MIPs, and vessels greater than 2 mm in diameter and longer than 3 cm were counted. The difference in vessel numbers detected in the two breasts determined the score.\nA total of 54 patients had malignant lesions (prevalence, 28%), including invasive ductal carcinoma (n=40), invasive mixed ductal-lobular carcinoma (n=5), invasive lobular carcinoma (n=3), ductal carcinoma in situ (n=3), mucinous carcinoma (n=1), medullary carcinoma (n=1), and leukemic metastasis (n=1). In 62 patients, there were benign lesions (fibroadenomas, fibrocysts), and four patients had inflammation (granulomatous mastitis in two patients, breast tuberculosis in two patients). There were 78 normal cases. When a difference of at least two vessels was scored as vascular asymmetry, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative (-LR) of unilaterally increased vascularity associated with ipsilateral malignancy were 69%, 92%, 8.72, and 0.34, respectively.

Associated acute spinal cord injury (SCI) syndromes raise patient morbidity with a loss of independence and quality of life associated with a fair potential for recovery. Therefore, the management is focused on the avoidance of SCI. The assessment of mechanical stability of vertebral bodies is a central part of decision-making when considering operative therapy.

{"title": "The potential use of allogeneic platelet-rich plasma for large bone defect treatment: immunogenicity and defect healing efficacy.", "abstract": "Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been extensively investigated for large bone defect treatment, but its clinical application is harassed by controversial outcome, due to highly variable PRP quality among patients. Alternatively, allogeneic PRP from well-characterized donors cannot only generate more consistent and reliable therapeutic effect but also avoid harvesting large quantities of blood, an additional health burdens to patients. However, the use of allogeneic PRP for bone defect treatment is generally less investigated, especially for its immunogenicity in such application. Here, we meticulously investigated the immunogenicity of allogeneic PRP and evaluated its healing efficacy for critical-sized defect treatment. Allogeneic PRP contained 4.1-fold and 2.7- to 4.9-fold higher amount of platelets and growth factors than whole blood, respectively. The intramuscular injection of allogeneic PRP to rabbits did not trigger severe and chronic immunoresponse, evidenced by little change in muscular tissue microstructure and CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a T lymphocyte subpopulation in peripheral blood. The implantation of allogeneic PRP/deproteinized bone matrix (DPB) constructs (PRP+DPB) successfully bridged 1.5-cm segmental radial defects in rabbits, achieving similar healing capacity as autologous MSC/DPB constructs (MSC+DPB), with greater bone formation (1.1-1.5\u00d7, p<0.05) and vascularization (1.3-1.6\u00d7, p<0.05) than DPB alone, shown by histomorphometric analysis, bone mineral density measurement, and radionuclide bone imaging. Furthermore, the implantation of both allogeneic PRP- and autologous MSC-mediated DPB constructs (PRP + MSC + DPB) resulted in the most robust bone regeneration (1.2-2.1\u00d7, p<0.05) and vascularization (1.3-2.0\u00d7, p<0.05) than others (PRP+DPB, MSC+DPB, or DPB alone). This study has demonstrated the promising use of allogeneic PRP for bone defect treatment with negligible immunogenicity, great healing efficacy, potentially more consistent quality, and no additional health burden to patients; additionally, the synergetic enhancing effect found between allogeneic PRP and autologous MSCs may shed a light on developing new therapeutic strategies for large bone defect treatment.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2012-08-07", "authors": ["Zhi-YongZhang", "Ai-WenHuang", "Jun JunFan", "KuanhaiWei", "DanJin", "BinChen", "DanLi", "LongBi", "JunWang", "GuoxianPei"], "doi": "10.3727/096368912X653183"}

The actual effect of current antivascular treatment including embolization to HCC is not satisfactory. Compensatory angiogenesis is one of the primary causes responsible for failure of antiangiogenic therapy. Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) are considered as important building blocks for adult neovascularization. However, the role of mobilized BM-EPCs in HCC remains unknown. In this study, GFP+-BM orthotropic HCC mice were established to investigate whether BM-EPCs are involved in HCC-induced neovascularization. We found that a large number of BM-EPCs were mobilized into the circulation with the development of HCC, recruited into the HCC region and incorporated into the vascular endothelium directly by differentiation into vascular endothelial cells, including sinus, capillary vessels and great vessels. Dynamic observation revealed that the mobilization and the incorporation of BM-EPCs into different types of vessels were present in early phases and throughout the whole process of HCC growth. The proportion of BM-EPCs in vessels increased gradually, from 17 to 21% with tumor growth. Moreover, injected GFP+-EPCs also specifically homed to tumor tissue and incorporated into tumor vessels directly. In this initial study, we demonstrated that BM-EPCs play a prominent role in HCC neovascularization.

Using a directed in vivo angiogenesis assay and a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, we show that Nodal promotes vascular recruitment in vivo.

{"title": "Zinc finger transcription factor zDC is a negative regulator required to prevent activation of classical dendritic cells in the steady state.", "abstract": "Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) process and present antigens to T cells. Under steady-state conditions, antigen presentation by cDCs induces tolerance. In contrast, during infection or inflammation, cDCs become activated, express higher levels of cell surface MHC molecules, and induce strong adaptive immune responses. We recently identified a cDC-restricted zinc finger transcription factor, zDC (also known as Zbtb46 or Btbd4), that is not expressed by other immune cell populations, including plasmacytoid DCs, monocytes, or macrophages. We define the zDC consensus DNA binding motif and the genes regulated by zDC using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. By deleting zDC from the mouse genome, we show that zDC is primarily a negative regulator of cDC gene expression. zDC deficiency alters the cDC subset composition in the spleen in favor of CD8(+) DCs, up-regulates activation pathways in steady-state cDCs, including elevated MHC II expression, and enhances cDC production of vascular endothelial growth factor leading to increased vascularization of skin-draining lymph nodes. Consistent with these observations, zDC protein expression is rapidly down-regulated after TLR stimulation. Thus, zDC is a TLR-responsive, cDC-specific transcriptional repressor that is in part responsible for preventing cDC maturation in the steady state.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2012-08-02", "authors": ["Matthew MMeredith", "KangLiu", "Alice OKamphorst", "JulianaIdoyaga", "AritoYamane", "PierreGuermonprez", "SuzannahRihn", "Kai-HuiYao", "Israel TSilva", "Thiago YOliveira", "DimitrisSkokos", "RafaelCasellas", "Michel CNussenzweig"], "doi": "10.1084/jem.20121003\n10.1016/j.immuni.2008.08.006\n10.1093/nar/gkp335\n10.4049/jimmunol.1004006\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.08.010\n10.1073/pnas.111163698\n10.1038/42030\n10.1128/MCB.21.11.3609-3615.2001\n10.1126/science.276.5312.589\n10.1126/science.1136080\n10.1084/jem.20090557\n10.1084/jem.20091756\n10.1038/gene.2009.83\n10.1016/j.immuni.2011.09.007\n10.1084/jem.194.6.769\n10.1016/j.immuni.2004.05.002\n10.1038/nature03338\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00885.x\n10.1084/jem.136.4.697\n10.4049/jimmunol.1001205\n10.1084/jem.20030323\n10.1016/j.tcb.2006.09.003\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000058\n10.1038/ni1265\n10.1038/ng.203\n10.1084/jem.194.4.379\n10.1093/intimm/dxf082\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00879.x\n10.1038/ni1462\n10.1126/science.1170540\n10.1084/jem.20112675\n10.1126/science.1176676\n10.1128/MCB.24.23.10456-10469.2004\n10.1084/jem.188.11.2175\n10.1084/jem.20120030\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)00020-0\n10.1038/nm1643\n10.1073/pnas.231606698\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902914\n10.1038/ni.1615\n10.1084/jem.20052272\n10.1016/j.immuni.2011.10.017\n10.1038/ng0697-161\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.07.002"}
{"title": "Cancer prevention by targeting angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Healthy individuals can harbour microscopic tumours and dysplastic foci in different organs in an undetectable and asymptomatic state for many years. These lesions do not progress in the absence of angiogenesis or inflammation. Targeting both processes before clinical manifestation can prevent tumour growth and progression. Angioprevention is a chemoprevention approach that interrupts the formation of new blood vessels when tumour cell foci are in an indolent state. Many efficacious chemopreventive drugs function by preventing angiogenesis in the tumour microenvironment. Blocking the vascularization of incipient tumours should maintain a dormancy state such that neoplasia or cancer exist without disease. The current limitations of antiangiogenic cancer therapy may well be related to the use of antiangiogenic agents too late in the disease course. In this Review, we suggest mechanisms and strategies for using antiangiogenesis agents in a safe, preventive clinical angioprevention setting, proposing different levels of clinical angioprevention according to risk, and indicate potential drugs to be employed at these levels. Finally, angioprevention may go well beyond cancer in the prevention of a range of chronic disorders where angiogenesis is crucial, including different forms of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, ocular disorders, and neurodegeneration.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

The PRP/BMSC gel membrane was optimized using different compositions for optimal release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Survival and proliferation of cells in the PRP gel membrane with time were confirmed in addition to their osteogenic capacity. Furthermore, to evaluate the possible effects of the PRP/BMSC gel membrane on surrounding progenitor cells in the injury area, we found that the PRP gel membrane products could significantly induce the migration of human endothelial cells in vitro, and increased the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 in cultured BMSC. These cells also secreted significant amounts of soluble proangiogenic factors, such as PDGF-BB, VEGF, and interleukin-8 (IL-8).

An arteriovenous fistula between rabbit femoral artery and vein was anastomosed to form an AVL. It was placed in a circular side groove of the coral block.

Newly formed fibrous tissues and vasculature extended over the surfaces and invaded the interspaces of entire coral block. The new blood vessels robustly sprouted from the AVL.

Clinically, the extent and depth of burn injury may mandate the use of allograft for temporary wound coverage while autografts are serially harvested from the same donor areas. The paucity of donor sites in patients with burns involving large surface areas highlights the need for better skin substitutes that can achieve early and complete coverage and retain normal skin durability with minimal donor requirements. We have isolated autologous stem cells from the adipose layer of surgically debrided burned skin (dsASCs), using a point-of-care stem cell isolation device. These cells, in a collagen-polyethylene glycol fibrin-based bilayer hydrogel, differentiate into an epithelial layer, a vascularized dermal layer, and a hypodermal layer. All-trans-retinoic acid and fenofibrate were used to differentiate dsASCs into epithelial-like cells. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a matrix- and time-dependent change in the expression of stromal, vascular, and epithelial cell markers.

{"title": "Bach1 is critical for the transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Ras(V12) and maintains ERK signaling.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-products of aerobic respiration, promote genetic instability and contribute to the malignant transformation of cells. Among the genes related to ROS metabolism, Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, and a negative regulator of ROS-induced cellular senescence directed by p53 in higher eukaryotes. While ROS are intimately involved in carcinogenesis, it is not clear whether Bach1 is involved in this process. We found that senescent Bach1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) underwent spontaneous immortalization the same as did the wild-type cells. When transduced with constitutively active Ras (H-Ras(V12)), the proliferation and colony formation of these cells in vitro were markedly reduced. When transplanted into athymic nude mice, the growth and vascularization of tumors derived from Bach1-deficient cells were also decreased. Gene expression profiling of the MEFs revealed a new H-Ras(V12) signature, which was distinct from the previously reported signatures in epithelial tumors, and was partly dependent on Bach1. The Bach1-deficient cells showed diminished phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 in response to H-Ras(V12), which was consistent with the alterations in the gene expression profile, including phosphatase genes. Finally, Bach1-deficient mice were less susceptible to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxidide (4-NQO)-induced tongue carcinoma than wild-type mice.

{"title": "Evaluation of parenchymal fluid pressure in native and decellularized liver tissue.", "abstract": "One strategy for tissue engineering of bioartificial livers is the use of decellularized liver scaffolds, which contain a functional vascular network and intact extracellular matrix components. Due to the known mechanosensitivity of liver cells, particularly the response of hepatocytes to changes in parenchymal fluid pressure (PFP), it is necessary to evaluate the biomechanical environment within decellularized scaffolds. The objective of this study was to characterize the dependence of PFP on perfusion flow rate, in native and decellularized liver. Needle-guided Millar SPR-524 (3.5F) pressure sensors were inserted into liver parenchyma to measure PFP in-situ in rat (n=5) and ex-situ in portal vein-perfused native (n=5) and decellularized (n=7) liver tissue. Average in-situ PFP, measured in the left, central and right lobes, was found to be 2.86\u00b11.04 mmHg. PFP measured in ex-situ liver perfused at 3, 6, 9, and 12 ml/min was found to increase linearly with flow rate. Decellularized liver PFP ranged from 0.68 mmHg at 3ml/min to 2.42 mmHg at 12 ml/min, while native liver ranged from 4.32 \u0096 11.93 mmHg. Results demonstrate that PFP in decellularized scaffolds can be controlled by varying flow rate. These results will be implemented in a poroviscoelastic finite element model of liver perfusion, developed by the authors, to predict PFP distribution in three-dimensional scaffolds for known flow rates.

{"title": "Evaluation of chondrocyte growth and function subjected to 21% and 6% oxygen levels.", "abstract": "In osteoarthritis, the metabolic activity of the chondrocytes is shifted toward a state where new matrix synthesis is outweighed by breakdown of matrix constituents. The result is degeneration and gradual loss of articular cartilage. Although osteoarthritis is frequently regarded as a non-inflammatory form of arthritis, considerable data implicates a role for pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cartilage destruction associated with osteoarthritis. The best studied pro-inflammatory cytokines in osteoarthritis are interleukin-1\u00df (IL-1\u00df), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Since articular cartilage is not vascularized, it must rely on diffusion from the articular surface for nutrient and metabolic exchange. Consequently, the entire metabolism of the cell is geared towards operating at a low oxygen tension. In this study, chondrocytes were challenged with pro-inflammatory cytokines at 21% O2 and 6% O2. Chondrocyte proliferation, membrane integrity, oxidative stress, matrix metalloproteinase \u0096 9 (MMP-9) and hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) production were measured. Our results showed that there was less of a decrease in cell number at 6% O2 compared to 21% O2 after they were challenged with pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, there was less of an increase in oxidative stress, membrane damage and MMP-9 production at 6% O2 compared to21% O2.

{"title": "Biofabrication enables efficient interrogation and optimization of sequential culture of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes for formation of vascular cords in cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "We previously reported that preculture of fibroblasts (FBs) and endothelial cells (ECs) prior to cardiomyocytes (CMs) improved the structural and functional properties of engineered cardiac tissue compared to culture of CMs alone or co-culture of all three cell types. However, these approaches did not result in formation of capillary-like cords, which are precursors to vascularization in vivo. Here we hypothesized that seeding the ECs first on Matrigel and then FBs 24 h later to stabilize the endothelial network (sequential preculture) would enhance cord formation in engineered cardiac organoids. Three sequential preculture groups were tested by seeding ECs (D4T line) at 8%, 15% and 31% of the total cell number on Matrigel-coated microchannels and incubating for 24 h. Cardiac FBs were then seeded (32%, 25% and 9% of the total cell number, respectively) and incubated an additional 24 h. Finally, neonatal rat CMs (60% of the total cell number) were added and the organoids were cultivated for seven days. Within 24 h, the 8% EC group formed elongated cords which eventually developed into beating cylindrical organoids, while the 15% and 31% EC groups proliferated into flat EC monolayers with poor viability. Excitation threshold (ET) in the 8% EC group (3.4 \u00b1 1.2 V cm(-1)) was comparable to that of the CM group (3.3 \u00b1 1.4 V cm(-1)). The ET worsened with increasing EC seeding density (15% EC: 4.4 \u00b1 1.5 V cm(-1); 31% EC: 4.9 \u00b1 1.5 V cm(-1)).

The corneal neovascularized rabbits received a unilateral 7-mm-diameter central-penetrating keratoplasty. New Zealand white rabbits were used as donors and were divided into 4 treatment groups: the control group, which received no therapy; the 1% MMF eye drop group; the 1.0\u2009mg cyclosporin A (CsA)-IDDS-implanted group; and the 1.0\u2009mg MMF-IDDS-implanted group. Animals were followed up for 150 days, which involved examination of the corneal allografts (opacity, edema, and neovascularization) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The survival time of corneal allografts of these animal models was recorded in 4 groups. Histopathologic studies were carried out on the procured specimens of corneal allografts. The biocompatibility of MMF-IDDS in the anterior chamber in rabbits was also investigated.\nThe mean survival time of corneal allografts in the control and MMF eye drop groups was 18.7\u00b13.0 and 37.5\u00b16.2 days, respectively (P=0.005).

{"title": "Identification of galectin-1 as a critical factor in function of mouse mesenchymal stromal cell-mediated tumor promotion.", "abstract": "Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have recently been implicated as one source of the tumor-associated stroma, which plays essential role in regulating tumor progression. In spite of the intensive research, the individual factors in MSCs controlling tumor progression have not been adequately defined. In the present study we have examined the role of galectin-1 (Gal-1), a protein highly expressed in tumors with poor prognosis, in MSCs in the course of tumor development. Co-transplantation of wild type MSCs with 4T1 mouse breast carcinoma cells enhances the incidence of palpable tumors, growth, vascularization and metastasis. It also reduces survival compared to animals treated with tumor cells alone or in combination with Gal-1 knockout MSCs. In vitro studies show that the absence of Gal-1 in MSCs does not affect the number of migrating MSCs toward the tumor cells, which is supported by the in vivo migration of intravenously injected MSCs into the tumor. Moreover, differentiation of endothelial cells into blood vessel-like structures strongly depends on the expression of Gal-1 in MSCs. Vital role of Gal-1 in MSCs has been further verified in Gal-1 knockout mice.

Using a mouse model of thanatophoric dysplasia type II in which FGFR3(K650E) expression was directed to the appendicular skeleton, we show that the mutant receptor caused a block in chondrocyte differentiation specifically at the prehypertrophic stage. The differentiation block led to a severe reduction in hypertrophic chondrocytes that normally produce vascular endothelial growth factor, which in turn was associated with poor vascularization of primary ossification centers and disrupted endochondral ossification. We show that the differentiation block and defects in joint formation are associated with persistent expression of the chondrogenic factor Sox9 and down-regulation of \u03b2-catenin levels and activity in growth plate chondrocytes. Consistent with these in vivo results, FGFR3(K650E) expression was found to increase Sox9 and decrease \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activity in cultured mesenchymal cells. Coexpression of Fgfr3(K650E) and Sox9 in cells resulted in very high levels of Sox9 and cooperative suppression of \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription. Fgfr3(K650E) had opposing effects on Sox9 and \u03b2-catenin protein stability with it promoting Sox9 stabilization and \u03b2-catenin degradation. Since both Sox9 overexpression and \u03b2-catenin deletion independently blocks hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and cause chondrodysplasias similar to those caused by mutations in FGFR3, our results suggest that dysregulation of Sox9 and \u03b2-catenin levels and activity in growth plate chondrocytes is an important underlying mechanism in skeletal diseases caused by mutations in FGFR3.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2012-07-31", "authors": ["Chia-YiShung", "SaraOta", "Zi-QiangZhou", "Douglas RKeene", "Peter JHurlin"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/dds305"}

Mean data for uptake in individual tumor lines then showed expected trends with the largest uptake in the most vascularized tumor line. Tumor lines with increased collagen were also consistent with highest interstitial fluid pressure and correlated with lowest uptake of nanoparticles. The data is consistent with a delivery model indicating that while vascular permeability is maximized by neovascular growth, it is inhibited by collagen content and the resulting interstitial pressure. Imaging of these parameters in vivo can lead to better individual noninvasive methods to assess drug penetration in situ.\nIn this manuscript the dependence of nanoparticle delivery is addressed from the standpoint of vascular factors (the more vascularized, the better delivery) and as a function of collagen density and interstitial pressure (the higher these are, the worse the delivery).", "journal": "Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine", "date": "2012-07-31", "authors": ["SasonTorosean", "BrendanFlynn", "JohanAxelsson", "JasonGunn", "Kimberley SSamkoe", "TayyabaHasan", "Marvin MDoyley", "Brian WPogue"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nano.2012.07.002"}

In this study, we examined how scaffold-free spheroid and fibrin-based environments impact these parameters in human adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC)-based adipose constructs. ASCs were differentiated in spheroids or fibrin-based constructs. After 7 days, conditioned medium was collected and spheroids/fibrin-based constructs were either harvested or implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. Following 7 days of implantation, the number of blood vessels in fibrin-based constructs was significantly higher than in spheroids (93\u00b145 vs. 23\u00b111 vessels/mm(2)), and the inflammatory response to fibrin-based constructs was less severe. The reasons for these results were investigated further in vitro. We found that ASCs in fibrin-based constructs secreted significantly higher levels of the angiogenic factors VEGF and HGF and lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-8. Furthermore, ASCs in fibrin-based constructs secreted significantly higher levels of leptin and showed a 2.5-fold upregulation of the adipogenic transcription factor PPARG and a fourfold to fivefold upregulation of the adipocyte-specific markers FABP4, perilipin, and leptin.

{"title": "Inherent propensity of amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells towards endothelial lineage: vascularization from an avascular tissue.", "abstract": "One of the most pressing problems in injury is wound healing and blood vessel formation. The amniotic membrane is important in clinical applications as it is pro-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and anti-scarring and has low immunogenicity. In this study, we characterized amniotic membrane mesenchymal stem cells (AMMSCs) by their trademark mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) signature and profiled for embryonic pluripotency markers namely alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, SSEA3 and 4, and Klf4 by RT-PCR and nuclear localization of Oct4 and Nanog by immunocytochemistry. The amnion, although avascular, contains pro-angiogenic factors such as type I, III, IV and V collagen, laminin, and fibronectin in the extra cellular matrix. We, therefore, hypothesized that AMMSCs is pro-angiogenic. Thus, we demonstrate that MSCs derived from the amnion have a natural ability to initiate endothelialization and angiogenesis in vitro. Our results using a wound scratch assay and angiogenesis on Matrigel suggest a pro-angiogenic property of AMMSCs. We also show that native, uninduced AMMSCs are able to form endothelial rings in Matrigel. Further evidence was provided by RT-PCR showing the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as Tie2, Ang1, VEGF, VEGFR, vWF, KDR and Flt4 in native AMMSCs.

However, their clinical progression has been hampered because of limited single-agent efficacy, primarily caused by the persistence of surviving cells at the well perfused \"viable rim\" of tumors, which allows rapid tumor regrowth to occur. In addition, off-target adverse events, including cardiovascular toxicities, underscore a need for compounds with improved safety profiles. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action, antitumor efficacy, and cardiovascular safety profile of (S)-2-amino-N-(2-methoxy-5-(5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)isoxazol-4-yl)phenyl)-3-phenylpropanamide hydrochloride (STA-9584), a novel tubulin-binding VDA. In vitro, 2-methoxy-5-(5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)isoxazol-4-yl)aniline (STA-9122) (active metabolite of STA-9584) displayed increased potency relative to other tubulin-binding agents and was highly cytotoxic to tumor cells. STA-9584 induced significant tumor regressions in prostate and breast xenograft models in vivo and, in an aggressive syngeneic model, demonstrated superior tumor growth inhibition and a positive therapeutic index relative to combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P). It is noteworthy that histological analysis revealed that STA-9584 disrupted microvasculature at both the center and periphery of tumors. Compared with CA4P, STA-9584 induced a 73% increase in central necrotic area, 77% decrease in microvasculature, and 7-fold increase in tumor cell apoptosis in the remaining viable rim 24 h post-treatment. Ultrasound imaging confirmed that STA-9584 rapidly and efficiently blocked blood flow in highly perfused tumor regions. Moreover, cardiovascular effects were evaluated in the Langendorff assay and telemetered dogs, and cardiovascular toxicity was not predicted to be dose-limiting.

{"title": "miR-210 activates notch signaling pathway in angiogenesis induced by cerebral ischemia.", "abstract": "The compensatory angiogenesis that occurs after cerebral ischemia increases blood flow to the injured area and limits extension of the ischemic penumbra. In this way, it improves the local blood supply. Fostering compensatory angiogenesis is an effective treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However, angiogenesis in the adult organism is a complex, multi-step process, and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of angiogenesis are not well understood. Although Notch signaling reportedly regulates the vascularization process that occurs in ischemic tissues, little is known about the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of ischemia-induced angiogenesis after ischemic stroke. Recent research has indicated that miR-210, a hypoxia-induced microRNA, plays a crucial role in regulating the biological processes that occur in blood vessel endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of miR-210 in regulating angiogenesis in response to brain ischemia injury and the role of the Notch pathway in the body's response. We found miR-210 to be significantly up-regulated in adult rat ischemic brain cortexes in which the expression of Notch1 signaling molecules was also increased. Hypoxic models of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE-12) were used to assess changes in miR-210 and Notch1 expression in endothelial cells. Results were consistent with in vivo findings. To determine the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena, we transfected HUVE-12 cells with miR-210 recombinant lentiviral vectors. We found that miR-210 overexpression caused up-regulation of Notch1 signaling molecules and induced endothelial cells to migrate and form capillary-like structures on Matrigel.

SVVYGLR peptide stripes were micropatterned onto polymer surfaces by photolithography to study their effects on endothelial cell (EC) behavior. Our results showed that the EC behaviors (cell spreading, orientation and migration) were significantly more guided and regulated on narrower SVVYGLR micropatterns (10 and 50 \u00b5m) than on larger stripes (100 \u00b5m). Also, EC morphogenesis into tube formation was switched on onto the smaller patterns. We illustrated that the central lumen of tubular structures can be formed by only one-to-four cells due to geometrical constraints on the micropatterns which mediated cell-substrate adhesion and generated a correct maturation of adherens junctions. In addition, sprouting of ECs and vascular networks were also induced by geometrical cues on surfaces micropatterned with SVVYGLR peptides.

Co-cultured cell sheets were obtained by culturing perivascular-like (CD146(+)) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on an hBMSCs monolayer maintained in osteogenic medium for 7 days. The perivascular-like (CD146(+)) cells and the HUVECs migrated and organized over the collagen-rich osteogenic cell sheet, suggesting the existence of cross-talk involving the co-cultured cell types. Furthermore the presence of that particular ECM produced by the osteoblastic cells was shown to be the key regulator for the singular observed organization. The osteogenic and angiogenic character of the proposed constructs was assessed in vivo. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the explants revealed the integration of HUVECs with the host vasculature as well as the osteogenic potential of the created construct, by the expression of osteocalcin. Additionally, the analysis of the diameter of human CD146 positive blood vessels showed a higher mean vessel diameter for the co-cultured cell sheet condition, reinforcing the advantage of the proposed model regarding blood vessels maturation and stability and for the in vitro pre-vascularization of TE constructs.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-07-26", "authors": ["Lu\u00eds FMendes", "Rog\u00e9rio PPirraco", "WojciechSzymczyk", "Ana MFrias", "T\u00edrcia CSantos", "Rui LReis", "Alexandra PMarques"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0041051"}
{"title": "The body as a living bioreactor: a feasibility study of pedicle flaps for tracheal transplantation.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of long-segment tracheal stenosis remains problematic. Ex vivo transplantation of stem cell-derived tracheas has been established in humans using external tissue bioreactors. These bioreactors, however, are not widely accessible. Thus, we are developing a rotational flap-based \"internal bioreactor\" to allow in vivo stem cell engraftment in a pre-vascularized recipient bed. This muscle will also then serve as a carrier for the transplanted trachea during rotation into position for airway reconstruction. Herein, we present a study investigating the feasibility of two pedicle muscle flaps for implantation and subsequent tracheal transplantation. Trapezius and latissimus flaps were raised using established surgical techniques. The length and width of each flap, along with the distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea, were measured. The overall ability of the flaps to reach the trachea was assessed. Twelve flaps were raised in 5 fresh adult human cadavers. For the trapezius flap, averages were: flap length of 16.4 cm, flap width of 5.95 cm at the tip, and distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea of 11.1 cm. For the latissimus dorsi flap, averages were: flap length of 35.4 cm, flap width of 7.25 cm at the tip, and distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea of 27.3 cm. All flaps showed sufficient durability and rotational ability. Our results show that both trapezius and latissimus dorsi flaps can be transposed into the neck to allow tension-free closure of tracheal defects. For cervical tracheal transplantation, both flaps are equally adequate. We believe that trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscle flaps are potential tracheal implantation beds in terms of vascular supply, durability, and rotational ability.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2012-07-26", "authors": ["TanimaJana", "EyadKhabbaz", "Carrie MBush", "J DrewProsser", "Martin ABirchall", "Carol ANichols", "Gregory NPostma", "Paul MWeinberger"], "doi": "10.1007/s00405-012-2105-5"}

{"title": "Effect of intracortical vascular endothelial growth factor infusion and blockade during the critical period in the rat visual cortex.", "abstract": "VEGF is the major angiogenic and vascular permeability factor in health and disease. Vascular development depends on function, and in sensory areas is experience-dependent. Our aim was to investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the effects of intracortical infusion and neutralisation of VEGF during the first days of the critical visual period, when peak levels of endogenous VEGF secretion are reached. VEGF was intracortically delivered into middle cortical layers of P18 Long-Evans rats. Another cohort received anti-VEGF. Vehicle (PBS)-infused and non-operated animals were used as controls. Various immunopathological analyses were performed: Endothelial Barrier Antigen (EBA) for the BBB integrity and GFAP for astroglial response. Vascular density was measured by Butyryl Cholinesterase Histochemistry, neuronal density by NeuN immunohistochemistry and apoptosis by TUNEL staining. VEGF levels were measured by Western Blot. Decreased vascular permeability was evoked in VEGF-infused rats whilst EBA expression remained constant, suggesting a preserved BBB function. When VEGF was blocked, tissue showed a higher degree of extravasation and a decreased number of EBA-positive vessels surrounding the injury. Lesion induced by cannula implantation annulled the normal increase in vascular density and the decrease in neuronal density during this time. VEGF rescued in part the vascular increase, and also prevented physiological and pathological neuronal death. VEGF blockade induced a higher amount of neural loss and lower astrocytic reaction. Our results support the role of VEGF as extending beyond vascularization, preventing physiological and pathological neuronal death, not only in the injured hemisphere but also in the intact one suggesting a process of transhemispheric diaschisis.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2012-07-25", "authors": ["Enrike GArgando\u00f1a", "HarkaitzBengoetxea", "SusanaBulnes", "IrantzuRico-Barrio", "NaiaraOrtuzar", "Jose VLafuente"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2012.07.008"}
{"title": "IDO is a nodal pathogenic driver of lung cancer and metastasis development.", "abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme inhibitors have entered clinical trials for cancer treatment based on preclinical studies, indicating that they can defeat immune escape and broadly enhance other therapeutic modalities. However, clear genetic evidence of the impact of IDO on tumorigenesis in physiologic models of primary or metastatic disease is lacking. Investigating the impact of Ido1 gene disruption in mouse models of oncogenic KRAS-induced lung carcinoma and breast carcinoma-derived pulmonary metastasis, we have found that IDO deficiency resulted in reduced lung tumor burden and improved survival in both models. Micro-computed tomographic (CT) imaging further revealed that the density of the underlying pulmonary blood vessels was significantly reduced in Ido1-nullizygous mice. During lung tumor and metastasis outgrowth, interleukin (IL)-6 induction was greatly attenuated in conjunction with the loss of IDO. Biologically, this resulted in a consequential impairment of protumorigenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), as restoration of IL-6 recovered both MDSC suppressor function and metastasis susceptibility in Ido1-nullizygous mice. Together, our findings define IDO as a prototypical integrative modifier that bridges inflammation, vascularization, and immune escape to license primary and metastatic tumor outgrowth.\nThis study provides preclinical, genetic proof-of-concept that the immunoregulatory enzyme IDO contributes to autochthonous carcinoma progression and to the creation of a metastatic niche.

To treat chronic ear infections, tympanostomy drainage tubes are placed in surgically created holes in TMs which can become chronic perforations upon extrusion. Perforations are repaired using a variety of techniques, but are limited by morbidity, unsatisfactory closure rates, or minimal regeneration of the connective tissue. A more effective, minimally-invasive therapy is necessary to enhance the perforation closure rate. Current research utilizing decellularized or alignate materials moderately enhance closure but the native TM architecture is not restored. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a biocompatible elastomer which supports cell migration and enzymatically degrades in contact with vascularized tissue. PGS spool-shaped plugs were manufactured using a novel process. Using minimally invasive procedures, these elastomeric plugs were inserted into chronic chinchilla TM perforations. As previously reported, effective perforation closure occurred as both flange surfaces were covered by confluent cell layers; >90% of perforations were closed at 6-week postimplantation. This unique in vivo environment has little vascularized tissue. Consequently, PGS degradation was minimal over 16-week implantation, hindering regeneration of the TM fibrous connective tissue.

Significant barriers to the current approaches are associated with their low effectiveness, complexity and unproven biosafety. Here, we evaluated and optimized a fibrin-islet composite for effective glycemic control in a subcutaneous site whose environment is highly hypoxic due to low vascularization potential. In the setting of xenogeneic porcine islet transplantation into the subcutaneous space of a diabetic mouse, the in vivo islet functions were greatly affected by the concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin. The optimized hydrogel-type fibrin remarkably reduced the marginal islet mass to approximately one tenth that of islets without fibrin. This marginal islet mass was comparable to that in the setting of the subcapsular space of the kidney, which is a highly vascularized organ. Highly vascularized structures were generated inside and on the outer surface of the grafts. A hydrogel-type fibrin-islet composite established early diabetic control within an average of 3.4days after the transplantation. In the mechanistic studies, fibrin promoted local angiogenesis, enhanced islet viability and prevented fragmentation of islets into single cells.

We conducted a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation of mice lacking CYP27A1. We found that the loss of CYP27A1 led to dysregulation of retinal cholesterol homeostasis, including unexpected upregulation of retinal cholesterol biosynthesis. Cyp27a1-/- mice developed retinal lesions characterized by cholesterol deposition beneath the retinal pigment epithelium. Further, Cyp27a1-null mice showed pathological neovascularization, which likely arose from both the retina and the choroid, that led to the formation of retinal-choroidal anastomosis.

VEGF by itself here did not affect viability or differentiation of hNSCs, whereas growing cells on poly(D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles, with or without VEGF, doubled astrocytic and neuronal differentiation. Secretion of a burst and a sustained delivery of VEGF from the microparticles in vivo attracted endothelial cells from the host into this primitive tissue and in parts established a neovasculature, whereas in other parts endothelial cells were merely interspersed with hNSCs. There was also evidence of a hypervascularization indicating that further work will be required to establish an adequate level of vascularization. It is therefore possible to develop a putative neovasculature within de novo tissue that is forming inside a tissue cavity caused by a stroke.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-07-24", "authors": ["EllenBible", "OmarQutachi", "David Y SChau", "Morgan RAlexander", "Kevin MShakesheff", "MichelModo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.06.085"}

{"title": "Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs).", "abstract": "Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are now emerging as a good alternative to bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) for cellular therapy. Similarly to BM-MSC, ASCs can be easily isolated as adherent fibroblastoid cell population after processing lipoaspirate samples. Lipoaspiration provides a great number of cells, without extensive manipulation. ASCs express classical mesenchymal markers and only at early passages express CD34. ASCs can differentiate in cells of mesodermal lineages, such as adipocytes, osteocytes and condrocytes. ASCs share with BM-MSC the same ability to inhibit the proliferation of allogeneic, activated immune cells, thus affecting in vivo in animal models the onset and course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerous colitis (UC) and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). On the other hand, the main molecular pathway involved in this effect is still unclear. On the basis of this functional property, ASCs are used in different clinical trials to treat RA, CD, UC and GvHD. However, the most promising field of clinical application is represented by bone defect repair. Despite the ability to regenerate injured tissues and to block the progression of inflammatory disorders, some authors reported that ASCs can also induce, in in vivo animal models, the growth and vascularization of solid and hematological tumors. Conversely, ASCs have been shown to hamper tumor cell proliferation, reduce cell viability and induce necrosis. Thus, more accurate studies, collaborative protocols, high standardization of methods, and safety controls are required to exclude transformation of transplanted ASCs.", "journal": "Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis", "date": "2012-07-24", "authors": ["GiulioBassi", "LucianoPacelli", "RobertaCarusone", "JasminaZanoncello", "MauroKrampera"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transci.2012.06.004"}

{"title": "Adaptive and maladaptive cardiorespiratory responses to continuous and intermittent hypoxia mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is a fundamental stimulus that impacts cells, tissues, organs, and physiological systems. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and subsequent identification of other members of the HIF family of transcriptional activators has provided insight into the molecular underpinnings of oxygen homeostasis. This review focuses on the mechanisms of HIF activation and their roles in physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypoxia, with an emphasis on the cardiorespiratory systems. HIFs are heterodimers comprised of an O(2)-regulated HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1 subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1\u03b2 subunit. Induction of HIF activity under conditions of reduced O(2) availability requires stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 due to reduced prolyl hydroxylation, dimerization with HIF-1\u03b2, and interaction with coactivators due to decreased asparaginyl hydroxylation. Stimuli other than hypoxia, such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, can also activate HIFs. HIF-1 and HIF-2 are essential for acute O(2) sensing by the carotid body, and their coordinated transcriptional activation is critical for physiological adaptations to chronic hypoxia including erythropoiesis, vascularization, metabolic reprogramming, and ventilatory acclimatization. In contrast, intermittent hypoxia, which occurs in association with sleep-disordered breathing, results in an imbalance between HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 that causes oxidative stress, leading to cardiorespiratory pathology.", "journal": "Physiological reviews", "date": "2012-07-20", "authors": ["Nanduri RPrabhakar", "Gregg LSemenza"], "doi": "10.1152/physrev.00030.2011"}

There is no consensus concerning embolization in other metastases.

The origins of metastases were: 28 breast cancer (30.1%), 19 pulmonary carcinoma (20.4%), 16 renal cell carcinoma (17.2%), 30 other cancers (32.3%). Surgical procedures were: 52 thoracolumbar laminectomies with instrumentation, 29 thoracolumbar corpectomies or vertebrectomies, 12 cervical corpectomies. A preoperative microsphere embolization was performed in 35 patients. Blood loss was evaluated by: blood volume in surgical aspiration devices, number of transfused packed red blood cells units and hemoglobin variation during surgery.\nRenal metastases were systematically embolized. In the breast group, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in blood loss between embolization versus non-embolization. In the pulmonary group and in other metastases, no difference was found either. The extent of surgery (corpectomy/vertebrectomy versus thoracolumbar instrumentation and cervical corpectomy) increased bleeding: breast 1775ml versus 778ml and 600ml respectively (P=0.048), pulmonary 2500ml versus 430ml and 180ml (P=0.020), renal 3346ml versus 1175ml and 780ml (P=0.036) and others 1550ml versus 474ml and 400ml (P=0.020).\nEmbolization decreases the risk of hemorrhage in highly vascularized metastases such as renal cell carcinoma.

The tri-culture setup, seeded on highly porous biocompatible polymeric scaffolds closely mimics the natural anatomical context of pancreatic vasculature. Enhanced islet survival correlating with formation of functional tube-like endothelial vessels was demonstrated. Addition of foreskin fibroblasts to islet-endothelial cultures promoted tube-like structure formation, which further supported islet survival as well as insulin secretion. Gene expression profiles of EC growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM), morphogenes and differentiation markers were significantly different in 2D versus 3D culture systems and were further modified upon addition of fibroblasts.

{"title": "Context dependent role of the CD36--thrombospondin--histidine-rich glycoprotein axis in tumor angiogenesis and growth.", "abstract": "The angiogenic switch is a promising therapeutic target in cancer. Work by our laboratory and others has described an important endogenous anti-angiogenic pathway mediated by interactions of CD36, a receptor on microvascular endothelial cells, with proteins containing thrombospondin (TSP) type I repeat domains (TSR). Recent studies revealed that circulating Histidine Rich Glycoprotein (HRG) inhibits the anti-angiogenic potential of the CD36-TSR pathway by functioning as a decoy receptor that binds and sequesters TSR proteins. As tumors of different origin display variable expression profiles of numerous targets, we hypothesized that the TSP-CD36-HRG axis regulates vascularization and growth in the tumor microenvironment in a context, or tumor type, dependent manner. Growth of Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LL2) and B16F1 Melanoma tumor cell implants in syngeneic wild type (WT), hrg, or cd36 null mice were used as a model to interrogate this signaling axis. LL2 tumor volumes were greater in cd36 null mice and smaller in hrg null mice compared to WT. Immunofluorescent staining showed increased vascularity in cd36 null vs. WT and WT vs. hrg null mice. No differences in tumor growth or vascularity were observed with B16F1 implants, consistent with lack of expression of TSP-1 in B16F1 cells. When TSR expression was induced in B16F1 cells by cDNA transfection, tumor growth and vascularity were similar to that seen with LL2 cells. These data show a role for CD36-mediated anti-angiogenic activity in the tumor microenvironment when TSR proteins are available and demonstrate that HRG modulates this activity. Further, they suggest a mechanism by which tumor microenvironments may regulate sensitivity to TSR containing proteins.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-07-19", "authors": ["James ScottHale", "MeizhangLi", "MaksimSinyuk", "WilliJahnen-Dechent", "Justin DurlaLathia", "Roy LeeSilverstein"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0040033"}

The scaffolds were characterized for porosity and interconnectivity using pycnometry, scanning electron microscopy and micro-ct. These scaffolds were then divided into the following four groups: (a) HAp scaffold (n-HAp group), (b) rhBMP-2 physically adsorbed on HAp scaffold (HAp-BMP-2 Group), (c) polyelectrolyte coating on HAp scaffold without rhBMP-2 (HAp-PEI Scaffold Group), and (d) polyelectrolyte coating tethered with rhBMP-2 on HAp scaffold (HAp-PEI-BMP-2 Scaffold Group). Using 18 skeletally matured New Zealand white rabbits, these scaffolds were evaluated in a nonload bearing femoral condyle plug model.

A voxel-by-voxel activity sample algorithm (VM) without artifacts is presented to calculate the dose of the heterogeneous activity distribution for radionuclide dosimetry.\nThe source particle location is sampled according to the activity spatial distribution. The source particle weight is imparted by the relative activity concentration of its origination voxel. This algorithm is applied to calculate the dose volume histogram for multiple independent activity regions with Gauss diffusion activity distributions and then compared with the level partition method (LM). The minimal response and the mean tolerant initial total activity threshold required by tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability for radioimmunotherapy ((131)I-RIT) also were evaluated by the voxel-by-voxel sample algorithm and the LM. The effective clearance half-time is assumed to be equal to its physical half-life (i.e., 8.02 days for (131)I).\nThe result shows that the new algorithm is more consistent with the weighted superposition of the quasi-homogeneous activity distribution than the LM, especially for the multiple independent activity regions composed of different amounts of voxels. The new algorithm effectively avoids the leveling/binning artifacts to the heterogeneous activity distribution. The (131)I-RIT simulation also showed that the minimal response initial total activity threshold of tumors will be much more than the mean tolerant initial total activity threshold of normal organs (e.g., kidney) with the activity heterogeneous grade deteriorating.\nA VM is presented to simulate the dose of the heterogeneous activity distribution for radionuclide dosimetry.

However, current systems typically lead to low-level transgene expression located in host tissue surrounding the implant. Herein, we investigated the inclusion of macropores into hydrogels to facilitate cell ingrowth and enhance gene delivery within the macropores in vivo. Macropores were created within PEG hydrogels by gelation around gelatin microspheres, with gelatin subsequently dissolved by incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The macropores were interconnected, as evidenced by homogeneous cell seeding in vitro and complete cell infiltration in vivo. Lentivirus loaded within hydrogels following gelation retained its activity relative to the unencapsulated control virus. In vivo, macroporous PEG demonstrated sustained, elevated levels of transgene expression for 6 weeks, while hydrogels without macropores had transient expression. Transduced cells were located throughout the macroporous structure, while non-macroporous PEG hydrogels had transduction only in the adjacent host tissue. Delivery of lentivirus encoding for VEGF increased vascularization relative to the control, with vessels throughout the macropores of the hydrogel.

{"title": "Upcyte\u00ae microvascular endothelial cells repopulate decellularized scaffold.", "abstract": "A general problem in tissue engineering is the poor and insufficient blood supply to guarantee tissue cell survival as well as physiological tissue function. To address this limitation, we have developed an in vitro vascularization model in which a decellularized porcine small bowl segment, representing a capillary network within a collagen matrix (biological vascularized scaffold [BioVaSc]), is reseeded with microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs). However, since the supply of mvECs is limited, in general, and as these cells rapidly dedifferentiate, we have applied a novel technology, which allows the generation of large batches of quasi-primary cells with the ability to proliferate, whilst maintaining their differentiated functionality. These so called upcyte mvECs grew for an additional 15 population doublings (PDs) compared to primary cells. Upcyte mvECs retained endothelial characteristics, such as von Willebrandt Factor (vWF), CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, as well as positive Ulex europaeus agglutinin I staining. Upcyte mvECs also retained biological functionality such as tube formation, cell migration, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, which were still evident after PD27. Initial experiments using MTT and Live/Dead staining indicate that upcyte mvECs repopulate the BioVaSc Scaffold. As with conventional cultures, these cells also express key endothelial molecules (vWF, CD31, and eNOS) in a custom-made bioreactor system even after a prolonged period of 14 days. The combination of upcyte mvECs and the BioVaSc represents a novel and promising approach toward vascularizing bioreactor models which can better reflect organs, such as the liver.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Wound repair and regeneration.", "abstract": "The skin is the biggest organ of the human being and has many functions. Therefore, the healing of a skin wound displays an extraordinary mechanism of cascading cellular functions which is unique in nature. As healing and regeneration processes take place in all parts of the human body, this review focuses on the healing processes of the skin and highlights the classical wound healing phases. While regeneration describes the specific substitution of the tissue, i.e. the superficial epidermis, mucosa or fetal skin, skin repair displays an unspecific form of healing in which the wound heals by fibrosis and scar formation. The first stage of acute wound healing is dedicated to hemostasis and the formation of a provisional wound matrix, which occurs immediately after injury and is completed after some hours. Furthermore, this phase initiates the inflammatory process. The inflammatory phase of the wound healing cascade gets activated during the coagulation phase and can roughly be divided into an early phase with neutrophil recruitment and a late phase with the appearance and transformation of monocytes. In the phase of proliferation the main focus of the healing process lies in the recovering of the wound surface, the formation of granulation tissue and the restoration of the vascular network. Therefore, next to the immigration of local fibroblasts along the fibrin network and the beginning of reepithelialization from the wound edges, neovascularization and angiogenesis get activated by capillary sprouting. The formation of granulation tissue stops through apoptosis of the cells, characterizing a mature wound as avascular as well as acellular. During the maturation of the wound the components of the extracellular matrix undergo certain changes. The physiological endpoint of mammalian wound repair displays the formation of a scar, which is directly linked to the extent of the inflammatory process throughout wound healing.", "journal": "European surgical research.

{"title": "Perspective on the evolution of cell-based bone tissue engineering strategies.", "abstract": "Despite the compelling clinical needs in enhancing bone regeneration and the potential offered by the field of tissue engineering, the adoption of cell-based bone graft substitutes in clinical practice is limited to date. In fact, no study has yet convincingly demonstrated reproducible clinical performance of tissue-engineered implants and at least equivalent cost-effectiveness compared to the current treatment standards. Here, we propose and discuss how tissue engineering strategies could be evolved towards more efficient solutions, depicting three different experimental paradigms: (i) bioreactor-based production; (ii) intraoperative manufacturing, and (iii) developmental engineering. The described approaches reflect the need to streamline graft manufacturing processes while maintaining the potency of osteoprogenitors and recapitulating the sequence of biological steps occurring during bone development, including vascularization. The need to combine the assessment of efficacy of the different strategies with the understanding of their mechanisms of action in the target regenerative processes is highlighted. This will be crucial to identify the necessary and sufficient set of signals that need to be delivered at the injury or defect site and should thus form the basis to define release criteria for reproducibly effective engineered bone graft substitutes.", "journal": "European surgical research.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of these two elements on bone formation and vascularization in combination with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) in a critical-size bone defect in rabbits. The critical-size defects of the radius were filled with: (1) a calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) scaffold + phVEGF(165)-transfected BMSC (VEGF group), (2) CDHA and PRP, or (3) CDHA, autogenous BMSC, and PRP. As controls served: (4) the CDHA scaffold alone and (5) the CDHA scaffold and autogenous BMSC. The volume of new bone was measured by means of micro-CT scans, and vascularization was assessed in histology after 16 weeks. Bone formation was higher in the PRP + CDHA, BMSC + CDHA, and PRP + BMSC + CDHA groups than in the VEGF group (p < 0.05). VEGF transfection significantly promoted vascularization of the scaffolds in contrast to BMSC and PRP (p < 0.05), but was similar to the result of the CDHA + PRP + BMSC group. The results show that VEGF-transfected BMSC as well as the combination of PRP and BMSC improve vascularization, but bone healing was better with the combination of BMSC and PRP than with VEGF-transfected BMSC.

{"title": "Electrical communication in branching arterial networks.", "abstract": "Electrical communication and its role in blood flow regulation are built on an examination of charge movement in single, isolated vessels. How this process behaves in broader arterial networks remains unclear. This study examined the nature of electrical communication in arterial structures where vessel length and branching were varied. Analysis began with the deployment of an existing computational model expanded to form a variable range of vessel structures. Initial simulations revealed that focal endothelial stimulation generated electrical responses that conducted robustly along short unbranched vessels and to a lesser degree lengthened arteries or branching structures retaining a single branch point. These predictions matched functional observations from hamster mesenteric arteries and support the idea that an increased number of vascular cells attenuate conduction by augmenting electrical load. Expanding the virtual network to 31 branches revealed that electrical responses increasingly ascended from fifth- to first-order arteries when the number of stimulated distal vessels rose. This property enabled the vascular network to grade vasodilation and network perfusion as revealed through blood flow modeling. An elevation in endothelial-endothelial coupling resistance, akin to those in sepsis models, compromised this ascension of vasomotor/perfusion responses. A comparable change was not observed when the endothelium was focally disrupted to mimic disease states including atherosclerosis. In closing, this study highlights that vessel length and branching play a role in setting the conduction of electrical phenomenon along resistance arteries and within networks. It also emphasizes that modest changes in endothelial function can, under certain scenarios, impinge on network responsiveness and blood flow control.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In the search for parameters that might be characteristic for tumor capillaries we study the vascularization in mice for cancerous and healthy tissues using synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography in absorption and phase contrast modes. Our investigations are based on absorption tomograms of casted healthy and cancerous tissues as well as a phase tomogram of a fixated tumor. We demonstrate how the voxel-based tomography data can be vectorized to assess the capillary networks quantitatively. The processing includes segmentation, skeletonization, and vectorization to finally extract the vessel parameters. The mean diameter of capillaries in healthy and cancerous tissues corresponds to (8.0\u00b11.1) \u03bcm and (3.9\u00b11.1) \u03bcm, respectively. Further evaluated parameters show marginal or no differences between capillaries in healthy and cancerous tissues, namely fractal dimension 2.3\u00b10.3 vs. 2.3\u00b10.2, tortuosity (SOAM) 0.18 rad/\u03bcm vs. 0.24 rad/\u03bcm and vessel length 20 \u03bcm vs. 17 \u03bcm.

Neonatal cardiomyocytes implanted into the AVL chamber survived and assembled into a contractile flap confirming the basic features we previously showed in growing a cardiac construct. There was no significant loss of the assembled cardiac muscle from immune response. The engineered cardiac muscle flaps (ECMFs) formed were transplanted to the neck vessels of the same animal using a microsurgical technique, and all transplanted tissues remained contractile. The cardiac muscle volume of the control and transplant groups was estimated with histomorphometry using desmin and \u03b1-sarcomeric actin immunostaining, and there were no significant differences between the two groups. Finally, utilizing a novel model of transplantation, the ECMFs were transplanted to the heart of a recipient syngeneic rat as a vascularized tissue. The cardiac muscle within the transplanted ECMF was shown to survive and remain contractile for the 4-week post-transplantation period, and importantly, the cardiomyocytes retained the elongated, striated appearance of a mature phenotype.

{"title": "The role of matrix gla protein in ossification and recovery of the avian growth plate.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrix mineralization is an essential physiologic process in bone, teeth, and hypertrophic cartilage. Matrix Gla protein (MGP), an inhibitor of mineralization, is expressed by chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells to inhibit calcification of those soft tissues. Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), a skeletal abnormality apparent as a plug of non-vascularized, non-mineralized, white opaque cartilage in the tibial growth plate of avian species can serve as a good model for studying process and genes involved in matrix mineralization and calcification. In this work, we studied the involvement of MGP in the development of TD, as well as in the processes of spontaneous and induced recovery from this syndrome. First, we found that during normal bone development, MGP is expressed in specific time and locations, starting from wide-spread expression in the yet un-ossified diaphysis during embryonic development, to specific expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction and the secondary ossification center just prior to calcification. In addition, we show that MGP is not expressed in the impaired TD lesion, however when the lesion begins to heal, it strongly express MGP prior to its calcification. Moreover, we show that when calcification is inhibited, a gap is formed between the expression zones of MGP and BMP2 and that this gap is closed during the healing process. To conclude, we suggest that MGP, directly or through interaction with BMP2, plays a role as ossification regulator that acts prior to ossification, rather then simple inhibitor.", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "date": "2012-07-13", "authors": ["HarelDan", "StavSimsa-Maziel", "AdiReich", "DalitSela-Donenfeld", "EfratMonsonego-Ornan"], "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2012.00079\n10.1073/pnas.022637099\n10.2527/jas.2009-2068\n10.1016/8756-3282(95)98410-O\n10.1002/jcp.1041520118\n10.2527/jas.2007-0738\n10.1126/science.289.5477.265\n10.1002/ar.1091940110\n10.1002/jemt.1070280606\n10.1074/jbc.272.50.31496\n10.1016/0012-1606(88)90339-9\n10.1038/nature01657\n10.1038/386078a0\n10.1007/s004390050993\n10.1038/956\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.16.1.191\n10.1177/030098589403100401\n10.1073/pnas.97.24.13033\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01073.2004\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.06.004\n10.1021/bi00353a035\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00909-2\n10.1016/S1083-7515(03)00143-8\n10.2527/jas.2006-711\n10.1152/ajpregu.00864.2006\n10.1046/j.1538-7836.2003.00023.x\n10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.8.1443\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0050044\n10.1080/030794502/000070741\n10.1002/jcp.20105\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199705)65:2<209::AID-JCB7>3.0.CO;2-Y\n10.1083/jcb.147.5.1097\n10.1002/jcb.20211"}

Improper vascularization at the maternal-fetal interface can cause pregnancy complications and poor fetal outcomes. Recent evidence indicates that small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel subtype 3 (SK3) contributes to vascular remodeling during pregnancy, and we hypothesized that abnormal SK3 channel expression would alter the ability of the maternal cardiovascular system to adapt to pregnancy demands and lead to poor fetal outcomes. We investigated this hypothesis using transgenic Kcnn3(tm1Jpad)/Kcnn3(tm1Jpad) (SK3(T/T)) mice that overexpress the channel. Isolated pressurized uterine arteries from nonpregnant transgenic SK3(T/T) mice had larger basal diameters and decreased agonist-induced constriction than those from their wild-type counterparts; however, non-receptor-mediated depolarization remained intact. In addition to vascular changes, heart rates and ejection fraction were increased, whereas end systolic volume was reduced in SK3(T/T) mice compared with their wild-type littermates. Uterine sonography of the fetuses on pregnancy day 14 showed a significant decrease in fetal size in SK3(T/T) compared with wild-type mice; thus, SK3(T/T) mice displayed an intrauterine growth-restricted phenotype.

HPC mostly arises in the lower extremities and the retroperitoneum, while the head and neck area is the third most common site. The majority of HPCs are histologically benign. However, a small percentage possess atypical features, such as a high mitotic rate, high cellularity and foci of necrosis. We report a case of classical abdominal HPC that presented 7 years after the first surgical resection with thyroid metastases of malignant HPC. Microscopic examination revealed multiple hypercellular nodules with an infiltrative growth pattern. These nodules consisted of tightly packed fusiform or spindle-shaped cells with nuclear polymorphism and an increased mitotic rate. The tumour cells exhibited a marked expression of CD34. Cells were arranged around a prominent vascular network, occasionally with a 'staghorn' configuration. The results of this study support and confirm the theory that HPC is a rare neoplasm with unpredictable behaviour, as largely debated in the international literature.

Notably, in the preeclampsia group compared to the control group, we observed a higher mean histamine concentration, higher mast cell density (MCD), lower mean mast cell (MMCA) and lower vascular/extravascular (V/EVT) index. In physiological pregnancies, a positive correlation was observed between the histamine concentration and V/VEVT index as well as MCD and the V/VEVT index. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed between MMCA and the V/EVT index in physiological pregnancies.\nBased on the data from our study, we suggest that a differential distribution of mast cells and corresponding changes in the concentration of histamine are involved in the defective placental vascularization seen in preeclamptic placentas.", "journal": "Mediators of inflammation", "date": "2012-07-11", "authors": ["GrzegorzSzewczyk", "Micha\u0142Pyzlak", "JakubKlimkiewicz", "Wac\u0142awSmiertka", "MagdalenaMiedzi\u0144ska-Maciejewska", "DariuszSzukiewicz"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/307189"}

Two alginates, differing in composition and thus presenting different mechanical properties when hydrogels, were characterized. In both cases, encapsulated MSC viability was maintained at around 75%, and their secretion characteristics were retained 28 days postencapsulation. In vivo study revealed a high cardiac compatibility of the tested alginates: cardiac parameters were maintained, and rats did not present any sign of infection. Moreover, explanted hydrogels appeared surrounded by a vascularized tissue. However, scaffold implantability was highly dependent on alginate composition. G-type alginate patches, presenting higher elastic and Young moduli than M-type alginate patches, showed a better implantation easiness and were the only ones that maintained their shape and morphology in vivo.

{"title": "Annexin-1-mediated endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis are regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced inhibition of miR-196a expression.", "abstract": "Endothelial cell migration induced in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an essential step of angiogenesis. It depends in part on the activation of the p38/MAPKAP kinase-2/LIMK1/annexin-A1 (ANXA1) signaling axis. In the present study, we obtained evidence indicating that miR-196a specifically binds to the 3'-UTR region of ANXA1 mRNA to repress its expression. In accordance with the role of ANXA1 in cell migration and angiogenesis, the ectopic expression of miR-196a is associated with decreased cell migration in wound closure assays, and the inhibitory effect of miR-196a is rescued by overexpressing ANXA1. This finding highlights the fact that ANXA1 is a required mediator of VEGF-induced cell migration. miR-196a also reduces the formation of lamellipodia in response to VEGF suggesting that ANXA1 regulates cell migration by securing the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of the cell. Additionally, in line with the fact that cell migration is an essential step of angiogenesis, the ectopic expression of miR-196a impairs the formation of capillary-like structures in a tissue-engineered model of angiogenesis. Here again, the effect of miR-196a is rescued by overexpressing ANXA1. Moreover, the presence of miR-196a impairs the VEGF-induced in vivo neo-vascularization in the Matrigel Plug assay. Interestingly, VEGF reduces the expression of miR-196a, which is associated with an increased level of ANXA1. Similarly, the inhibition of miR-196a with an antagomir results in an increased level of ANXA1. We conclude that the VEGF-induced decrease of miR-196a expression may participate to the angiogenic switch by maintaining the expression of ANXA1 to levels required to enable p38-ANXA1-dependent endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in response to VEGF.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-07-10", "authors": ["Anne-LaurePin", "Fran\u00e7oisHoule", "PatrickFournier", "Ma\u00ebvaGuillonneau", "\u00c9ric RPaquet", "Martin JSimard", "IsabelleRoyal", "JacquesHuot"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.393561\n10.1007/s10456-012-9283-z"}

Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced acoustic angiographic images were acquired in both healthy (n = 7) and tumor-bearing (n = 10) rats. High-spatial-resolution and high signal-to-noise acquisition was enabled by using a prototype dual-frequency US transducer (transmit at 4 MHz, receive at 30 MHz). A segmentation algorithm was utilized to extract microvessel structure from image data, and the distance metric (DM) and the sum of angles metric (SOAM), designed to distinguish different types of tortuosity, were applied to image data. The vessel populations extracted from tumor-bearing tissue volumes were compared against vessels extracted from tissue volumes in the same anatomic location within healthy control animals by using the two-sided Student t test.\nMetrics of microvascular tortuosity were significantly higher in the tumor population.

{"title": "A comprehensive approach to long-standing facial paralysis based on lengthening temporalis myoplasty.", "abstract": "Long-standing peripheral monolateral facial paralysis in the adult has challenged otolaryngologists, neurologists and plastic surgeons for centuries. Notwithstanding, the ultimate goal of normality of the paralyzed hemi-face with symmetry at rest, and the achievement of a spontaneous symmetrical smile with corneal protection, has not been fully reached. At the beginning of the 20(th) century, the main options were neural reconstructions including accessory to facial nerve transfer and hypoglossal to facial nerve crossover. In the first half of the 20(th) century, various techniques for static correction with autologous temporalis muscle and fascia grafts were proposed as the techniques of Gillies (1934) and McLaughlin (1949). Cross-facial nerve grafts have been performed since the beginning of the 1970s often with the attempt to transplant free-muscle to restore active movements. However, these transplants were non-vascularized, and further evaluations revealed central fibrosis and minimal return of function. A major step was taken in the second half of the 1970s, with the introduction of microneurovascular muscle transfer in facial reanimation, which, often combined in two steps with a cross-facial nerve graft, has become the most popular option for the comprehensive treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. In the second half of the 1990s in France, a regional muscle transfer technique with the definite advantages of being one-step, technically easier and relatively fast, namely lengthening temporalis myoplasty, acquired popularity and consensus among surgeons treating facial paralysis. A total of 111 patients with facial paralysis were treated in Caen between 1997 and 2005 by a single surgeon who developed 2 variants of the technique (V1, V2), each with its advantages and disadvantages, but both based on the same anatomo-functional background and aim, which is transfer of the temporalis muscle tendon on the coronoid process to the lips. For a comprehensive treatment of the paralysis, the eyelids are usually managed by Paul Tessier's technique to lengthen the levator muscle of the upper eyelid by aponeurosis interposition, combined with external blepharorrhaphy with Krastinova-Lolov's technique. Facial reanimation using lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a dynamic procedure that has its roots in the techniques of Gillies and McLaughlin. This method is a true lengthening myoplasty procedure using no intermediate grafts. In general, the results with a 1-stage combination of lengthening temporalis myoplasty and static correction of the lagophthalmos appear comparable with the major series in the literature using free microneurovascular transfers combined with cross-facial nerve grafts for longstanding peripheral monolateral facial paralysis. The obvious advantages of temporalis elongation myoplasty consist in its technical ease, a single step, low incidence of complications and markedly reduced operating time.\nLe paralisi monolaterali periferiche di lunga data dell'adulto sono state per secoli un problema di difficile gestione per otorinolaringoiatri, neurologi e chirurghi plastici, e tuttora l'obiettivo finale della normalizzazione dell'emivolto paralizzato con simmetria a riposo ed un sorriso spontaneo e simmetrico, con al contempo la protezione della cornea non \u00e8 stato ancora pienamente conseguito. All'inizio del ventesimo secolo le opzioni principali in questi casi erano le anastomosi nervose con altri rami, possibili solo quando il moncone distale del VII fosse stato recuperabile, ed eseguite con il nervo accessorio e l'ipoglosso. Nella prima met\u00e0 del ventesimo secolo vennero proposte varie tecniche di correzione statica, tra queste quella di Gillies e quella di McLaughlin comportavano l'utilizzo del muscolo temporale e di innesti di fascia autologhi.Gli innesti nervosi incrociati sul nervo facciale sono stati eseguiti dall'inizio degli anni Settanta, talvolta combinati con il trapianto di tessuto muscolare nel tentativo di ripristinare dei movimenti attivi. Tuttavia nei primi trapianti il muscolo era non rivascolarizzato ed esitavano inevitabilmente in fibrosi e minimo recupero funzionale. Un importante passo avanti \u00e8 venuto nella seconda met\u00e0 degli anni Settanta con l'introduzione dei lembi liberi rivascolarizzati nella riabilitazione delle paralisi del facciale che, combinata, spesso come seconda procedura, con un innesto nervoso sul facciale funzionante controlaterale, \u00e8 diventata l'opzione pi\u00f9 popolare e praticata nel mondo dai cultori della materia. Nella seconda met\u00e0 degli anni Novanta la plastica di allungamento del temporale, tecnica che prevede il trasferimento di un lembo muscolare regionale, con il vantaggio di essere monofasica, tecnicamente pi\u00f9 semplice e relativamente rapida, si \u00e8 progressivamente diffusa in Francia, guadagnando popolarit\u00e0 e consensi tra i chirurghi che si occupano di paralisi del facciale. A Caen un singolo chirurgo ha trattato 111 pazienti con paralisi del facciale tra il 1997 ed il 2005, sviluppando 2 diverse varianti della tecnica (V1 e V2) basate entrambe sugli stessi principi anatomofunzionali: il trasferimento del tendine del muscolo temporale dal processo coronoideo alla rima buccale. Ai fini di un trattamento completo della paralisi, la palpebra superiore viene solitamente gestita attraverso la tecnica di Paul-Tessier, che prevede un allungamento del tendine dell'elevatore tramite innesto di fascia, quella inferiore mediante una blefarrorrafia esterna secondo Krastinova-Lolov. La rianimazione del facciale attraverso la plastica di allungamento del temporale \u00e8 una procedura dinamica che affonda le sue radici nelle tecniche descritte da Gillies e McLaughlin. A differenza di queste ultime, si tratta di una plastica di allungamento vera che non prevede l'utilizzo di innesti. Secondo la nostra opinione, complessivamente, la combinazione in un'unica procedura di suddetta plastica di allungamento con le sopracitate tecniche di correzione statica del lagoftalmo appare ottenere risultati comparabili con le maggiori casistiche descritte in letteratura di trasferimento di lembi muscolari microneurovascolari combinati con innesti incrociati sul facciale controlaterale, per il trattamento di paralisi facciali monolaterali periferiche di lunga data. Gli ovvi vantaggi della tecnica consistono nel fatto che prevede un unico tempo chirurgico, \u00e8 tecnicamente relativamente semplice, sicuramente pi\u00f9 rapida e quindi caratterizzata da un pi\u00f9 basso tasso di complicanze perioperatorie.", "journal": "Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale", "date": "2012-07-07", "authors": ["DLabb\u00e8", "FBussu", "AIodice"], "doi": null}

The improved cell adhesion was correlated with an increased amount of cells attached to the implant surface after retrieval. There was no difference in the inflammatory response between untreated and treated samples.

{"title": "Vascularized bone tissue engineering: approaches for potential improvement.", "abstract": "Significant advances have been made in bone tissue engineering (TE) in the past decade. However, classical bone TE strategies have been hampered mainly due to the lack of vascularization within the engineered bone constructs, resulting in poor implant survival and integration. In an effort toward clinical success of engineered constructs, new TE concepts have arisen to develop bone substitutes that potentially mimic native bone tissue structure and function. Large tissue replacements have failed in the past due to the slow penetration of the host vasculature, leading to necrosis at the central region of the engineered tissues. For this reason, multiple microscale strategies have been developed to induce and incorporate vascular networks within engineered bone constructs before implantation in order to achieve successful integration with the host tissue. Previous attempts to engineer vascularized bone tissue only focused on the effect of a single component among the three main components of TE (scaffold, cells, or signaling cues) and have only achieved limited success. However, with efforts to improve the engineered bone tissue substitutes, bone TE approaches have become more complex by combining multiple strategies simultaneously. The driving force behind combining various TE strategies is to produce bone replacements that more closely recapitulate human physiology. Here, we review and discuss the limitations of current bone TE approaches and possible strategies to improve vascularization in bone tissue substitutes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Patients with VHL disease commonly present with hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and the eye while other manifestations include pheochromocytoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, endolymphatic sac tumors of the middle ear, pancreatic cystadenomas, epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas. Animal models inactivating the VHL gene product in various organ tissues have been constructed over the past 15 years to parse its HIF-associated mechanisms and its link to tumorigenesis. These models, despite advancing our understanding the molecular role of VHL, are by and large unable to recapitulate the more common features of human VHL disease. Up to date, no model exists that develop retinal hemangioblastomas, the most common clinical manifestation.

Rat bone marrow MSCs were cultured with malignant rat glioma C6 cells without direct cell-cell contact. After 7\u2009days, the cells were assessed for transformation using flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence and chromosomal analysis. In addition, wild-type (WT) p53, mutant p53 and mdm2 was determined using Western blotting. Almost all MSCs became phenotypically malignant cells, with significantly decreased WT p53 expression and increased expression of mutant p53 and mdm2, along with an aneuploid karyotype. To evaluate tumorigenesis in vivo, the MSCs indirect co-cultured with C6 cells for 7\u2009days were transplanted subcutaneously into immuno-deficient mice. The cells developed into a large tumour at the injection site within 8\u2009weeks, with systemic symptoms including cachexia and scoliosis. Pathological and cytological analysis revealed poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells with a dense vascular network and aggressive invasion into the adjacent muscle.

A key challenge is to quantify a wide range of blood velocities in vessels deep within living specimens with concurrent diffraction-limited resolution imaging of vascular cells. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) has shown tremendous promise in analyzing blood velocities hundreds of micrometers deep in animals with cellular resolution. However, current analysis of TPLSM-based data is limited to the lower range of blood velocities and is not adequate to study faster velocities in many normal or disease conditions.\nWe developed line-scanning particle image velocimetry (LS-PIV), which used TPLSM data to quantify peak blood velocities up to 84 mm/s in live mice harboring brain arteriovenous malformation, a disease characterized by high flow. With this method, we were able to accurately detect the elevated blood velocities and exaggerated pulsatility along the abnormal vascular network in these animals. LS-PIV robustly analyzed noisy data from vessels as deep as 850 \u00b5m below the brain surface. In addition to analyzing in vivo data, we validated the accuracy of LS-PIV up to 800 mm/s using simulations with known velocity and noise parameters.\nTo our knowledge, these blood velocity measurements are the fastest recorded with TPLSM. Partnered with transgenic mice carrying cell-specific fluorescent reporters, LS-PIV will also enable the direct in vivo correlation of cellular, biochemical, and hemodynamic parameters in high flow vascular development and diseases such as atherogenesis, arteriogenesis, and vascular anomalies.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-07-05", "authors": ["Tyson NKim", "Patrick WGoodwill", "YeniChen", "Steven MConolly", "Chris BSchaffer", "DorianLiepmann", "Rong AWang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0038590"}

However, in some cases, it is possible (or mandatory) to utilize the remnant stomach for oesophagoplasty (EP). This method preserves some advantages of the gastric EP in comparison with the bowel EP. During recent years, several papers have been published in English regarding remnant stomach EP, and different aspects of this procedure have been discussed. However, there is still no comprehensive literature review analysing the possible EP approaches using the remnant stomach. A multilingual literature search (database and manual) to collect and classify the currently available data regarding remnant stomach EP following DGE and its subsequent analysis was carried out. There are a number of principally different methods of a remnant stomach EP: (1) mobilization of the remnant stomach with the spleen and tail of the pancreas with its transposition into the left hemithorax; (2) mobilization of the remnant stomach after splenectomy; (3) implementation of a reversed gastric tube, tailored from the major curve; (4) the use of a transplant fed from the right gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries; (5) the use of a transplant fed from the left gastric and short gastric arteries; (6) complete mobilization of the remnant stomach; (7) direct revascularization of the gastric stump conduit.

Mass transport has been identified as the primary culprit, limiting the delivery of nutrients (such as oxygen and glucose) and removal of wastes, from tissues deep within a cellular scaffold. While strategies to develop sufficient vasculature to overcome hypoxia in vitro are promising, inconsistencies between the in vitro and the in vivo environments may still negate the effectiveness of large-volume tissue-engineered scaffolds. While a common theme in tissue engineering is to maximize oxygen supply, studies suggest that moderate oxygenation of cellular scaffolds during in vitro conditioning is preferable to high oxygen levels.

{"title": "Systematic assessment in an animal model of the angiogenic potential of different human cell sources for therapeutic revascularization.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) capable of initiating or augmenting vascular growth were recently identified within the small population of CD34-expressing cells that circulate in human peripheral blood and which are considered hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Soon thereafter human HPC began to be used in clinical trials as putative sources of EPC for therapeutic vascular regeneration, especially in myocardial and critical limb ischemias. However, unlike HPC where hematopoietic efficacy is related quantitatively to CD34+ cell numbers implanted, there has been no consensus on how to measure EPC or how to assess cellular graft potency for vascular regeneration. We employed an animal model of spontaneous neovascularization to simultaneously determine whether human cells incorporate into new vessels and to quantify the effect of different putative angiogenic cells on vascularization in terms of number of vessels generated. We systematically compared competence for therapeutic angiogenesis in different sources of human cells with putative angiogenic potential, to begin to provide some rationale for optimising cell procurement for this therapy.\nHuman cells employed were mononuclear cells from normal peripheral blood and HPC-rich cell sources (umbilical cord blood, mobilized peripheral blood, bone marrow), CD34+ enriched or depleted subsets of these, and outgrowth cell populations from these. An established sponge implant angiogenesis model was adapted to determine the effects of different human cells on vascularization of implants in immunodeficient mice. Angiogenesis was quantified by vessel density and species of origin by immunohistochemistry.\nCD34+ cells from mobilized peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood HPC were the only cells to promote new vessel growth, but did not incorporate into vessels. Only endothelial outgrowth cells (EOC) incorporated into vessels, but these did not promote vessel growth.\nThese studies indicate that, since EPC are very rare, any benefit seen in clinical trials of HPC in therapeutic vascular regeneration is predominantly mediated by indirect proangiogenic effects rather than through direct incorporation of any rare EPC contained within these sources. It should be possible to produce autologous EOC for therapeutic use, and evaluate the effect of EPC distinct from, or in synergy with, the proangiogenic effects of HPC therapies.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2012-07-05", "authors": ["G RobinBarclay", "OlgaTura", "KaySamuel", "Patrick WfHadoke", "Nicholas LMills", "David ENewby", "Marc LTurner"], "doi": "10.1186/scrt114\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.014\n10.1111/j.1774-9987.2005.00218.x\n10.1038/nm0603-702\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.08.014\n10.1016/j.trsl.2010.06.008\n10.1387/ijdb.103219ct\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.08.033\n10.1160/TH09-10-0688\n10.1016/j.mvr.2009.12.004\n10.1177/1358863X08098698\n10.1016/j.exphem.2007.04.002\n10.1097/MOH.0b013e328345a16a\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.144972\n10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03360.x\n10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02292.x\n10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.213\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192138\n10.3727/096368910X516637\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.059\n10.1073/pnas.0500641102\n10.1186/1479-5876-5-37\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.03900.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000058702.69484.A0\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0833\n10.1182/blood-2006-08-043471\n10.1038/sj.cr.7310075\n10.1182/blood-2004-04-1396\n10.1089/scd.2006.0062\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178590\n10.1016/j.mvr.2011.08.011\n10.1111/j.1365-2613.2008.00633.x\n10.1182/blood-2004-08-3057\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.01.135\n10.1007/s00441-006-0222-4\n10.1182/blood-2008-09-181362\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050255\n10.1167/iovs.10-6101\n10.1182/blood-2006-12-062471\n10.1093/cvr/cvr278\n10.1007/s00395-009-0021-7\n10.1073/pnas.0710516105\n10.3727/096368909X476869\n10.1253/circj.CJ-09-0584"}

{"title": "Apelin enhances cardiac neovascularization after myocardial infarction by recruiting aplnr+ circulating cells.", "abstract": "Neovascularization stimulated by local or recruited stem cells after ischemia is a key process that salvages damaged tissue and shows similarities with embryonic vascularization. Apelin receptor (Aplnr) and its endogenous ligand apelin play an important role in cardiovascular development. However, the role of apelin signaling in stem cell recruitment after ischemia is unknown.\nTo investigate the role of apelin signaling in recruitment after ischemia.\nAplnr was specifically expressed in circulating cKit+/Flk1+ cells but not in circulating Sca1+/Flk1+ and Lin+ cells. cKit+/Flk1+/Aplnr+ cells increased significantly early after myocardial ischemia but not after hind limb ischemia, indicative of an important role for apelin/Aplnr in cell recruitment during the nascent biological repair response after myocardial damage. In line with this finding, apelin expression was upregulated in the infarcted myocardium. Injection of apelin into the ischemic myocardium resulted in accelerated and increased recruitment of cKit+/Flk1+/Aplnr+ cells to the heart. Recruited Aplnr+/cKit+/Flk1+ cells promoted neovascularization in the peri-infarct area by paracrine activity rather than active transdifferentiation, resulting into cardioprotection as indicated by diminished scar formation and improved residual cardiac function. Aplnr knockdown in the bone marrow resulted in aggravation of myocardial ischemia-associated damage, which could not be rescued by apelin.\nWe conclude that apelin functions as a new and potent chemoattractant for circulating cKit+/Flk1+/Aplnr+ cells during early myocardial repair, providing myocardial protection against ischemic damage by improving neovascularization via paracine action.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2012-07-04", "authors": ["DennieTempel", "Martinede Boer", "Elza Dvan Deel", "Remco AHaasdijk", "Dirk JDuncker", "CarolineCheng", "StefanSchulte-Merker", "Henricus JDuckers"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.262097"}

A prospective study has been conducted on two groups of pregnant women. Group I included pregnant women with a normal evolution of the pregnancy, whereas group II consisted of pregnant women with preeclampsia. The subjects were assessed by ultrasound between the 28th and 38th week of amenorrhea. Intraplacental vascularization was studied by 3D and Doppler ultrasound.

In normal pregnancies, the evolution of umbilical resistivity index (RI) values was statistically proven to be significantly correlated with the values of intraplacental vascularization indices. In the case of pathological pregnancies, RI values could be maintained within normal limits, whereas vascularization, flow, and vascularization-flow index values decreased significantly compared with the group of normal pregnancies.\nThe determination of intraplacental vascularization indices can play an important role in the monitoring of placental circulation in pregnancies with a normal evolution and those with preeclampsia.", "journal": "Journal of perinatal medicine", "date": "2012-07-04", "authors": ["Carmen MihaelaMihu", "TudorDrugan", "DanMihu"], "doi": "10.1515/jpm-2011-0105"}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that MP\u0394 exhibits an adaxial-abaxial asymmetry in its ability to influence organ development.

The incidence and severity of adhesion formation following open or laparoscopic surgery remain controversial. The role of CO(2) pneumoperitoneum is also widely discussed. This study aimed to compare adhesion formation following peritoneal injury by electrocoagulation performed through open or laparoscopic procedures in a rat model.\nSixty male rats were randomized to undergo a 1.5-cm peritoneal injury with unipolar cautery under general anesthesia: open surgery (Group A, n=20), laparoscopic surgery with CO(2) pneumoperitoneum (Group B, n=20), and laparoscopic surgery with air pneumoperitoneum (Group C, n=20). Duration of the procedures was fixed at 90 minutes in all groups, and pneumoperitoneum pressure was kept at 10 mm Hg. Ten days later, the animals underwent a secondary laparotomy to score peritoneal adhesions using qualitative and quantitative parameters.\nForty-five rats developed at least one adhesion: 95% in Group A, 83% in Group B, and 55% in Group C (P<.01; Group C versus Group A, P<.01). According to number, thickness, tenacity, vascularization, extent, type, and grading according to the Z\u00fchkle classification, no significant difference was observed between Groups A and B. The distribution of adhesions after open surgery was significantly different than after laparoscopic surgery (P<.001). It is interesting that Group C rats developed significantly fewer adhesions at the traumatized site, and their adhesions had less severe qualitative scores compared with those after open surgery (P<.01).\nIn this animal model, CO(2) laparoscopic surgery did not decrease the formation of postoperative adhesion, compared with open surgery.

This entity often develops as a result of failure to make an early diagnosis and a late start to treatment. This report describes the case of a 15-year-old patient with a history of a neglected fracture of the scaphoid tubercle that occurred one year earlier and evolved to pseudarthrosis of the tubercle, which is an unusual location for this type of complication. The diagnosis was made from the clinical history and radiographic examination. The treatment was undertaken in accordance with the Matti-Russe technique, by means of a volar route, thus avoiding injury to the scaphoid vascularization, with good clinical and radiographic evolution. Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid tubercle is a rare condition resulting from a fracture in an unusual location in the scaphoid bone, and it is important because it affects the young and active population. The correct diagnosis is only rarely made by radiologists or surgeons at the time of the fracture, because of failure to recognize this entity. This mistake delays and causes difficulty in treatments for the complications resulting from this kind of fracture. Therefore, it is essential to include this condition in differential diagnoses in order to avoid mistaken conduct.

{"title": "PP010. Does aldosterone participate in placental angiogenesis via PLGF?", "abstract": "Angiogenic signals are a vital signal of placental integrity. Aldosterone has recently been shown to enhance placental growth factor (PlGF) expression in the peripheral vasculature [1] and to promote trophoblast growth [2]. The plgf gene possesses a functional mineralocorticoid receptor responsive element in the promoter region.\nThus, we hypothesized that aldosterone adapts placental angiogenesis to trophoblast growth by secreting PlGF.\nThe human choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo and first and third trimester human primary trophoblasts cells were subjected to several syncytialization signals. Upon visual confirmation, the cultured cells were subjected to either control conditions, the known stimulator forskolin, and increasing amounts of aldosterone (10(-9) to 10(-6)M) with and without the competitive aldosterone receptor blocker spironolactone. After 6 and 24h of incubation, RNA and protein were extracted. PlGF transcripts were quantified by Taqman PCR normalized to several housekeeping genes. Protein expression was quantified by ELISA.\nPlGF mRNA expression increased 3-fold with forskolin in BeWo cells. In this cell line, aldosterone could slightly stimulate PlGF production. In non-syncytialized primary human first trimester trophoblasts, aldosterone did not exert a specific effect. In contrast, the term primary human trophoblasts did respond with a 2.5-fold increase after incubation with aldosterone (10(-7)M) in the presence of forskolin to allow forming a syncytial layer. PlGF protein was already slightly upregulated following 6h of incubation with aldosterone.\nWe concluded that aldosterone does regulate PlGF expression in specified conditions during pregnancy. Inappropriately low aldosterone levels such as in preeclampsia might such not only compromise plasma volume and trophoblast growth but also placental vascularization and systemic PlGF availability. These observations merit further investigation.", "journal": "Pregnancy hypertension", "date": "2012-07-01", "authors": ["NEisele", "CGennari-Moser", "CAlbrecht", "MBaumann", "DSurbek", "M GMohaupt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.preghy.2012.04.121"}

Inadequate remodeling of the spiral arteries resulting in decreased blood flowto the placenta has been implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and IUGR. 3D power Doppler angiography (PDA) is a noninvasive and safe way to study blood flow within an organ or region of interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate PDA as a method to quantify placental perfusion in a pharmacological rabbit model of vascular IUGR induced by inhibition of NO synthesis.\nOur objective was to evaluate the 3D power Doppler angiography (PDA) in terms of feasibility and ability to detect placental hypo-perfusion in an experimental rabbit model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).\nFourteen pregnant females were treated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, from day 24 to day 28 of gestation, to induce an IUGR. Concomitantly, 8 pregnant rabbits were used as controls. On day 28, 3D power Doppler indices were quantified in each uteroplacental unit.\nA total number of 180 live fetuses were obtained, 180 from the L-NAME group and 72 from the control group. G28 fetal weight was significantly lower in the L-NAME group than in the control group (27.40\u00b10.55g vs 33.14\u00b10.62g,p<0.0001). In the L-Name group the vascularization index (VI) was significantly lower than in the control group (2.6 [1.4;6.0] vs 7.6 [3.5;12.6],p<0.05).

Tolerance was not observed in either model. Adipose tissue survival after discontinuation of cyclosporine was independent of treatment duration. The inclusion of vascularized bone to the adipose tissue allograft provided an additional protective effect.

Pericytes are known to function in stabilizing blood vessels, but their role in vascular sprouting and selective vessel regression is poorly understood. The endosialin (CD248) receptor is expressed by pericytes associated with newly forming but not stable quiescent vessels. In the present study, we used the Endosialin(-/-) mouse as a means to uncover novel roles for pericytes during the process of vascular network formation. We demonstrate in a postnatal retina model that Endosialin(-/-) mice have normal vascular sprouting but are defective in selective vessel regression, leading to increased vessel density. Examination of the Endosialin(-/-) mouse tumor vasculature revealed an equivalent phenotype, indicating that pericytes perform a hitherto unidentified function to promote vessel destabilization and regression in vivo in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. Mechanistically, Endosialin(-/-) mice have no defect in pericyte recruitment. Rather, endosialin binding to an endothelial associated, but not a pericyte associated, basement membrane component induces endothelial cell apoptosis and detachment.

Adipose tissue is known to secrete several angiogenic factors, and human adipose stromal cells (hASC) are known to promote vessel growth, maturation and stabilization. In this study, hASC were induced to angiogenesis with growth factor-enriched medium either in monoculture or in coculture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and analyzed for vascular, pericytic and smooth muscle cell markers. hASC and HUVEC cocultures showed an accelerated proliferation rate and the cells self-assembled, independent of the cell passage number, into multilayered three-dimensional tubular networks. The networks of hASC and HUVEC expressed endothelial markers, a complete basement membrane and vessel-supporting cells with contractile properties. A hASC and green fluorescence protein-HUVEC-infection model revealed that cocultures consisted of a mosaic of von Willebrand factor-positive cells derived from both cell populations - hASC and HUVEC. hASC monoculture had passage- and donor-dependent ability to form tubular networks, with half of the cultures presenting tubule structures and basement membrane formation. Pericytic and smooth muscle cell markers were expressed in hASC monoculture even when tubules were absent. By combining the potential properties of hASC and features from the present angiogenesis assays, we generated a natural-like, xeno-free, prevascular-like network in vitro model with excellent reproducibility and minimal limitations in technical performance.

Intravenous administration of these cells is the preferred route for therapeutic delivery of MSCs. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are the first cell type that MSCs encounter following IV administration. However, little is known about the biological consequences of interactions between MSCs and ECs, and if any therapeutic benefit results from this interaction. We show that MSCs exert potent stabilizing effects on ECs using an in vitro coculture system. Such effects include decreased EC proliferation and the reduction of EC vascular network formation in matrigel. Interestingly, these effects appear to require EC-MSC contact and result in enhanced colocalization of VE-Cadherin and \u03b2-catenin at the cell membrane. Disruption of the VE-Cadherin/\u03b2-catenin interaction abrogates the observed effects. As a functional in vivo correlate, we show that intravenously administered MSCs strongly inhibit angiogenesis in a matrigel plug assay. Taken together, these results identify a novel mechanism of action of MSCs that involves a contact-dependent EC interaction. These findings are relevant to intravenous use of MSCs and provide insight into further optimizing therapeutic strategies involving MSCs.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2012-06-28", "authors": ["TylerMenge", "MichaelGerber", "KathrynWataha", "WilliamReid", "SushovanGuha", "Charles SCox", "PramodDash", "Marvin SReitz", "Aarif YKhakoo", "ShibaniPati"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2012.0165"}

Free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) may provide a durable means to preserve the femoral head. When used in the precollapse stages of ONFH, this treatment may alter the course of disease.\nWe asked: (1) In what percentage of patients does FVFG preserve the femoral head beyond 10\u00a0years? (2) When long-term preservation is not achieved, what is the duration of femoral head preservation? (3) Do demographic or etiologic factors predict FVFG survivorship? (4) What long-term improvements in function and activity can be anticipated?\nWe retrospectively reviewed 61 patients (65 hips) who underwent FVFG for precollapse ONFH. We calculated graft survivorship, SF-12 scores, activity levels, and Harris hip scores. Minimum followup was 10.5\u00a0years (mean, 14.4\u00a0years; range, 10.5-26\u00a0years). Results Forty-nine of 65 hips (75%) had surviving FVFG for at least 10\u00a0years. At last followup, 39 of 65 hips (60%) had surviving FVFG, with a mean graft survival time of 15\u00a0years (range, 10.5-26.1\u00a0years). Twenty-six of the 65 hips with FVFG (40%) underwent conversion to THA at a mean of 8\u00a0years postoperatively. Demographic factors, lesion size, additional procedures, and low preoperative function were not associated with changes in graft survivorship. Pain and function were similar in patients with surviving FVFG and patients who had conversion to THA. Patients with surviving FVFG were more likely to engage in impact sports or active events than were patients who had conversion to THA.\nWhen patients with precollapse ONFH undergo FVFG, the majority have preservation of the hip lasting for greater than 10\u00a0years with low levels of pain and reasonable function. In patients who ultimately undergo conversion surgery to THA, the mean duration of hip preservation before conversion is 8\u00a0years.

To prolong and slow the release of angiogenic factors, which stimulate both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, we constructed a novel self-assembling peptide by attaching the heparin-binding domain sequence LRKKLGKA to the self-assembling peptide RADA16. This designer self-assembling peptide self-assembled into nanofiber scaffolds under physiological conditions, as observed by atomic force microscopy. The injection of designer self-assembling peptides can efficiently provide the sustained delivery of VEGF for at least 1 month. At 4 weeks after transplantation, cardiac function was improved, and scar size and collagen deposition were markedly reduced in the group receiving VEGF with the LRKKLGKA scaffolds compared with groups receiving VEGF alone, LRKKLGKA scaffolds alone or VEGF with RADA16 scaffolds. The microvessel density in the VEGF with LRKKLGKA group was higher than that in the VEGF with RADA16 group. TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 expression assays showed that the transplantation of VEGF with LRKKLGKA enhanced cell survival in the infarcted heart.

Therefore, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can provide an alternative, plentiful source for generation of reproducible hMSCs. We have developed efficient differentiation protocols for derivation of hMSCs from hESCs, including coculture with murine OP9 stromal cells and feeder layer-free system. Our protocols have resulted in the generation of up to 49% of hMSCs, which expressed CD105, CD90, CD29, and CD44. The hMSCs exhibited high adipogenic, chondrocytic, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. The latter correlated with osteocalcin secretion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the differentiating hMSCs. hMSC-derived osteoblasts further differentiated and formed ectopic bone in vivo, and induced the formation of blood vessels in Matrigel implants.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of HUCMS to improve the survival of ischemic skin flap. HUCMS cells were characterized with surface markers, and were labeled with 5-acetylene base-2 'deoxidizing uracil nucleoside (EdU) in vitro. Twenty male immunodeficient BALB/c mice with an epigastric flap were randomly divided into two groups. HUCMS cells or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) were injected into the subcutaneous flap tissues. On the 7th postoperative day, flap survival, capillary density, levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and EdU-positive cells in the skin flap were examined. Results showed that flap survival rate was higher in the HUCMS cell group (P < 0.05). Capillary density, VEGF level, and bFGF level were higher in the HUCMS cell group (P < 0.05). EdU-labeled HUCMS cells were mainly distributed in the subcutaneous flap tissues. These findings suggest that HUCMS cells can improve the survival of ischemic skin flap by promoting vascularization, which may be attributed to the increased expression of VEGF and bFGF.", "journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2012-06-26", "authors": ["XiangfengLeng", "QiuZhang", "XiaodongZhai", "ZhenyuChen"], "doi": "10.1620/tjem.227.191"}

Non transgenic mice were used to study Isl1 kinetics post-MI by RT-PCR and FACS analysis. MI was induced in non transgenic mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Naked DNA encoding Isl1 was injected to the peri-infarct region. Evaluation of cardiac performance was conducted by echocardiogram. Analysis of myocardial fibrosis and number of vessels was performed on histological cryosections.\nIsl1 gives rise to subpopulations of progenitors in both the bone marrow and spleen, and is re-expressed in the spleen and left ventricle following MI. Intramyocardial gene transfer of Isl1 to the border zone of the infarcted hearts resulted in partial salvage of left ventricular function, enhanced vascularization, and reduced myocardial fibrosis.

It is reported to have minimal donor site morbidity and the ability to provide structural support and torsional strength to load-bearing areas. The flap has found particular success in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions. The tarsal navicular, similar to the scaphoid, is largely articular cancellous bone with little surface area for vascular inflow. These anatomic features make the navicular prone to nonunion and avascular necrosis in traumatic scenarios. We describe a case of nonunion and avascular necrosis of the tarsal navicular occurring as sequelae of a high-impact midfoot injury sustained in an automobile accident. After an initial attempt at open reduction and internal fixation with midfoot bridge plating, subsidence and nonunion resulted. An attempt at arthrodesis of the talonavicular and naviculocuneiform joints was then undertaken. This too failed, leading to the development of additional collapse and avascular necrosis. The site was treated with a medial femoral condyle vascularized bone flap. In this single case, the patient returned to pain-free ambulation and reported excellent outcomes and functional capacity.

{"title": "Controlled proteolytic cleavage site presentation in biomimetic PEGDA hydrogels enhances neovascularization in vitro.", "abstract": "The volume of tissue that can be engineered is limited by the extent to which vascularization can be stimulated within the scaffold. The ability of a scaffold to induce vascularization is highly dependent on its rate of degradation. We present a novel approach for engineering poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels with controlled protease-mediated degradation independent of alterations in hydrogel mechanical and physical properties. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive peptides containing one (SSite) or three (TriSite) proteolytic cleavage sites were engineered and conjugated to PEGDA macromers followed by photopolymerization to form PEGDA hydrogels with tethered cell adhesion ligands of YRGDS and with either single or multiple MMP-sensitive peptide domains between cross links. These hydrogels were investigated as provisional matrices for inducing neovascularization, while maintaining the structural integrity of the hydrogel network. We show that hydrogels made from SSite and TriSite peptide-containing PEGDA macromers polymerized under the same conditions do not result in alterations in hydrogel swelling, mesh size, or compressive modulus, but result in statistically different hydrogel degradation times with TriSite gels degrading in 1-3\u2009h compared to 2-4 days in SSite gels. In both polymer types, increases in the PEGDA concentration result in decreases in hydrogel swelling and mesh size, and increases in the compressive modulus and degradation time. Furthermore, TriSite gels support vessel invasion over a 0.3-3.6\u2009kPa range of compressive modulus, while SSite gels do not support invasion in hydrogels above compressive modulus values of 0.4\u2009kPa. In vitro data demonstrate that TriSite gels result in enhanced vessel invasion areas by sevenfold and depth of invasion by twofold compared to SSite gels by 3 weeks. This approach allows for controlled, localized, and cell-mediated matrix remodeling and can be tailored to tissues that may require more rapid regeneration and neovascularization.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In the endothelium, perturbations of cell cholesterol have an impact on fundamental processes. We, therefore, assessed the effects of LXR activation on endothelial functions related to angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.\nLXR agonists (T0901317, GW3965) blunted migration, tubulogenesis, and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. By affecting endothelial cholesterol homeostasis, LXR activation impaired the compartmentation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in lipid rafts/caveolae and led to defective phosphorylation and downstream signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 upon vascular endothelial growth factor-A stimulation. Consistently, the antiangiogenic actions of LXR agonists could be prevented by coadministration of exogenous cholesterol. LXR agonists reduced endothelial sprouting from wild-type but not from LXR\u03b1(-/-)/LXR\u03b2(-/-) knockout aortas and blunted the vascularization of implanted angioreactors in vivo. Furthermore, T0901317 reduced the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma grafts in mice by impairing angiogenesis.\nPharmacological activation of endothelial LXRs reduces angiogenesis by restraining cholesterol-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 compartmentation and signaling.

Stereotyped angiogenesis is vital for both developmental growth and to restore tissue metabolic supply after ischemic events. Central neurons such as those found in the brain, spinal cord, and retina are vast consumers of oxygen and nutrients and therefore require high rates of perfusion by functional vascular networks to ensure proper sensory transmission. During a metabolic mismatch, such as that occurring during a cerebrovascular infarct or in ischemic retinopathies, there is increasing evidence that central neurons have an inherent ability to influence the vascular response to injury. With a focus on the retina and retinal ischemic disorders, this review explores the ever-growing evidence suggesting that central neurons have the propensity to impact tissue vascularization and reparative angiogenesis. Moreover, it addresses the paradoxical ability of severely ischemic neurons to hinder vascular regrowth and thus segregate the most severely injured zones of nervous tissue.

{"title": "Thalidomide attenuates mammary cancer associated-inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice.", "abstract": "Thalidomide has proven to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activities in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. We investigated the effects of this compound on key components (blood vessel formation, inflammatory cell recruitment/activation, cytokine production) of 4T1 mammary tumor in mice. In addition, tumor growth and lung metastasis were evaluated. 4T1 cells were injected subcutaneously into Balb/c mice. After tumor engraftment (5days), thalidomide (150mg/kg) was administered to the treated group for 7days. Tumors of control (saline) and treated groups were sized regularly, removed 12days after inoculation and processed for biochemical and immunohistological parameters to assess neovascularization, inflammation and proliferative activity. Daily oral dose of thalidomide was able to reduce in 46% the tumor volume. The number of metastasis in the lungs was less in the thalidomide-treated group compared with the control animals. Assessment of tumor vascularization revealed a significant decrease in blood vessels formation by thalidomide. Likewise, the expression of FGF-1 showed weaker cytoplasmic positivity in the group treated with thalidomide compared with the control group. The levels of two cytokines, VEGF (pro-angiogenic) and TNF-\u03b1 (pro-inflammatory) were decreased in tumor samples of thalidomide-treated group compared with the control group. Accumulation of neutrophils or macrophages in the 4T1 tumor measured by the activities of inflammatory enzymes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) for neutrophils and N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) for macrophages was inhibited by the treatment. By targeting key components of 4T1 tumor simultaneously, thalidomide was effective in attenuating tumor growth and metastasis. This approach, suppression of inflammation and angiogenesis may provide further insights for both prevention and treatment of cancer.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2012-06-19", "authors": ["CristinaMaria de Souza", "LucianaFonseca de Carvalho", "Tamarada Silva Vieira", "AnaC\u00e2ndida Ara\u00fajo E Silva", "MiriamTeresa Paz Lopes", "M\u00f4nicaAlves Neves Diniz Ferreira", "SilviaPassos Andrade", "GeovanniDantas Cassali"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2012.04.005"}
{"title": "Different effects of catechin on angiogenesis and inflammation depending on VEGF levels.", "abstract": "Although physiological and pathological angiogenesis develop through similar processes, during pathological angiogenesis, proangiogenic factors are exacerbated. Polyphenols have been considered therapeutic tools for conditions exhibiting enhanced angiogenesis. However, the possibility that these compounds may also prevent vascularization in physiological situations is a major drawback for their use. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of 0.1-100 \u03bcM catechin on endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) regarding angiogenic and inflammatory processes. Catechin modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation was also evaluated in vivo using different models of angiogenesis: one physiological (skin wound-healing assay) and another one resembling pathological angiogenesis, exhibiting higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A stimulation (Matrigel plug assay). The in vitro results showed that 100 \u03bcM catechin increased viability (to 165.58% and to 165.34%) and decreased apoptosis (53.45% and 92.65%) and proliferation (33.19% and 23.36%) of EC and VSMC, respectively. Catechin affected migration and invasion, tending to increase both in EC and decreasing them in VSMC; however, it did not change sprouting angiogenesis. Nevertheless, catechin diminished in vitro inflammatory modulators such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (58.66% for human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 85.46% for human aortic smooth muscle cells) and nuclear factor kappa-B (38.43% for VSMC). The in vivo results demonstrated that catechin did not change angiogenesis and inflammation in skin wound-healing model and substantially decreased these processes in Matrigel plug assay. Altogether, the current study showed that catechin has different effects in angiogenesis and inflammation depending on VEGF-A levels. The absence of adverse effects in mature vasculature favors catechin potential use against pathological situations where angiogenesis is stimulated.", "journal": "The Journal of nutritional biochemistry", "date": "2012-06-19", "authors": ["RitaNegr\u00e3o", "RaquelCosta", "DelfimDuarte", "Tiago TaveiraGomes", "IsabelAzevedo", "RaquelSoares"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.12.011"}

{"title": "The effect of inhibition of heat-shock proteins on thiram-induced tibial dyschondroplasia.", "abstract": "Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is a skeletal abnormality that can cause economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Thiram-induced TD is characterized by enlarged, unvascularized growth plates, low levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor Flk-1, abnormal chondrocyte differentiation, and lameness. Recently we reported the involvement of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in chondrocyte differentiation and growth-plate vascularization. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity in thiram-induced TD resulted in increased Flk-1 levels, re-instated normal growth-plate angiogenesis and morphology, and abrogated lameness. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of various concentrations of 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), an inhibitor of Hsp90 activity, in preventing growth-plate histopathology and lameness in TD-affected chicks. Low doses of 17-DMAG (2 injections, each of 100 or 300 \u03bcg) did not prevent TD development even though Flk-1 levels were restored, which suggests that Flk-1 is not the only rate-limiting factor in growth-plate angiogenesis. High doses of 17-DMAG (2 injections, each of 600 or 900 \u03bcg) prevented BW loss, decreased the TD score, reduced lesion width, restored proper chondrocyte differentiation, increased blood vessel invasion, and eliminated lameness. To assess the specificity of Hsp90, we evaluated the efficacy of the flavonoid quercetin, an inhibitor of Hsp70 synthesis, in preventing TD development; it decreased Hsp70 levels but not those of Hsp90 in the control growth plates and prevented upregulation of Hsp70 in the TD-affected growth plates. Dietary quercetin (at 100 or 500 ppm) did not prevent the hypoxia that is characteristic of the TD-affected growth plate or development of thiram-induced TD and lameness. The present results demonstrate the specificity and the major role of Hsp90 in chondrocyte differentiation and growth-plate vascularization. In contrast to the anti-angiogenic effect of 17-DMAG observed in mammals, inhibition of Hsp90 activity in the unvascularized TD-affected growth plates resulted in activation of the angiogenic switch and restored normal growth-plate morphology.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2012-06-16", "authors": ["OGenin", "AHasdai", "DShinder", "MPines"], "doi": "10.3382/ps.2012-02207"}
{"title": "Real-time visualization and characterization of tumor angiogenesis and vascular response to anticancer therapies.", "abstract": "In vivo angiogenesis assays provide more physiologically relevant information about tumor vascularization than in vitro studies because they take the complex interactions among cancer cells, endothelial cells, mural cells, and tumor stroma into consideration. Traditional microscopic assessment of vascular density conducted by immunostaining of tissue sections or by lectin angiogram visualization of tumor vessels is invasive and requires the sacrifice of tumor-bearing animals. Therefore, it prohibits longitudinal time-course observation in a single animal and requires a large number of animals at each time point to derive statistically-meaningful observations. Additionally, heterogenous behavior among different tumors will inevitably introduce individual biological variance that may obscure reliable interpretation of the results. While various artificial in vivo angiogenesis assays, such as the Matrigel implant assay, chick chorioallatoic membrane assay, and dorsal skin fold chamber assay have been developed and employed to more directly observe the progression of physiological angiogenesis, they can not appropriately assess tumor angiogenic progression or tumor vascular regression in response to therapeutic intervention. Here, we describe a noninvasive method and a detailed protocol that we have developed and optimized using the Olympus OV-100 in vivo imaging system for real-time high-resolution visualization and assessment of tumor angiogenesis and vascular response to anticancer therapies in live animals. We show that using this approach, tumor vessels can be monitored longitudinally through the whole vasculogenesis and angiogenesis process in the same mouse. Further, morphologic changes of the same vessel prior to and after drug treatments can be captured with microscopic high resolution. Moreover, the multichannel co-imaging capability of the OV-100 allows us to analyze and compare tumor vessel permeability before and after antiangiogenesis therapy by employing a near-infrared blood pool reagent, or by visualizing improved cytotoxic drug delivery upon tumor vessel normalization by using a fluorophore tagged drug. This noninvasive method can be readily applied to orthotopically transplanted breast cancer models as well as to subcutaneously-transplanted tumor models.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2012-06-16", "authors": ["H RosieXing", "QingbeiZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-61779-797-2_8"}

These processes can be difficult to study, as they often occur deep within the body of a cancer patient or an experimental animal. In vitro assays are able to model some aspects of these processes, and a number of assays have been developed to assess cancer cell motility, migration, and invasion. However, in vitro assays have inherent limitations that may miss important aspects of these processes as they occur in vivo. The chick embryo provides a powerful model for studying these processes in vivo, facilitated by the external and accessible nature of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), a well-vascularized tissue that surrounds the embryo. When coupled with multiple fluorescent approaches to labeling both cancer cells and the embryonic vasculature, along with image analysis tools, the chick CAM model offers cost-effective, rapid assays for studying cancer cell migration and metastasis in a physiologically-relevant, in vivo setting.

RCCs are highly vascularized and respond positively to antiangiogenic therapy. Endostatin (ES) is a fragment of collagen XVIII that possesses antiangiogenic activity. In this study, we examined the potential of ES-based antiangiogenic therapy to activate tumor-associated endothelial cells in metastatic RCC (mRCC). Balb/c-bearing Renca cells were treated with NIH/3T3-LendSN or, as a control, with NIH/3T3-LXSN cells. The T-cell subsets and lymphocyte populations of tumors, mediastinal lymph nodes and the spleen were assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was assessed by real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analysis. ES gene therapy led to an increase in the percentage of infiltrating CD4-interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 cells (P<0.05), CD8-IFN-\u03b3 cells (P<0.01) and CD49b-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 cells (P<0.01). In addition, ES therapy caused an increase at the mRNA level of ICAM-1 (1.4-fold; P<0.01) and VCAM-1 (1.5-fold) (control vs treated group; P<0.001). Through flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the CD34/ICAM-1 cells (8.1-fold; P<0.001) and CD34/VCAM-1 cells (1.6-fold; P<0.05). ES gene therapy induced a significant increase in both T CD4 and CD8 cells in the lymph nodes and the spleen, suggesting that ES therapy may facilitate cell survival or clonal expansion. CD49b cells were also present in increased quantities in all of these organs.

Three four-dimensional (4-D) STIC PD datasets of the fetoplacental circulation were obtained above the placental cord insertion. The vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization-flow index (VFI) were calculated offline using a standardized spherical sonobiopsy technique for all frames of the cardiac cycle.

While 2D substrates with tunable elasticity have been studied for control of stem cell differentiation, we recently developed a stratified co-culture model of angiogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that differentiate on a tunable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, thereby creating a physiologic context for elasticity-induced differentiation. Endothelial cells (EC) were cultured on top of the hMSC construct on a collagen gel to monitor network formation. Media composition influenced EC invasion due to the conditioning media, the reduction of serum and supplemental growth factors, and the addition of recombinant growth factors. Conditioned media, recombinant growth factors and direct co-culture were compared for endothelial cell invasive response using quantitative image analysis. As anticipated, use of recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced the deepest EC invasions while direct co-culture caused shallow invasions compared to other conditions. However, endothelial cells displayed lumen-like morphology, suggesting that cell-cell interaction in the co-culture model could mimic sprouting behaviour. In summary, an engineered suitable biochemical and physical environment facilitated endothelial cells to form 3D vessel structures onto hMSCs. These structures were plated on a stiff surface known to induce osteodifferentiation of stem cells.

The vascularized composite allograft consisted of all facial skin, mimetic muscles, the tongue, the midface by means of a Le Fort III osteotomy, and the mandible by means of sagittal split osteotomies. Craniofacial computed tomographic scans were obtained before and after the mock transplants. Surgical planning software was used to virtually plan the osteotomies, and a surgical navigation system guided the osteotomies intraoperatively. Cephalometric analyses were compared between the virtually planned transplants and the actual postoperative results.\nThe combination of preoperative computerized planning and intraoperative guidance consistently produced a vascularized composite allograft that could be easily fixated to the prepared recipient, with only minimal burring of osteotomy sites necessary. Satisfactory occlusion was maintained, and postoperative computed tomography confirmed accurate skeletal fixation. Insignificant differences with regard to cephalometric analyses were noted when predicted and actual postoperative data were compared.\nThe authors' experience treating severe craniofacial injury allowed consistent transfer of facial vascularized composite allografts, maintaining proper occlusion. Preoperative computer planning and intraoperative navigation ensured precise osteotomies and a good donor-recipient skeletal match, which greatly reduced the need for intraoperative adjustments and manipulation.

{"title": "Constructing a collagen hydrogel for the delivery of stem cell-loaded chitosan microspheres.", "abstract": "Multipotent stem cells have been shown to be extremely useful in the field of regenerative medicine. However, in order to use these cells effectively for tissue regeneration, a number of variables must be taken into account. These variables include: the total volume and surface area of the implantation site, the mechanical properties of the tissue and the tissue microenvironment, which includes the amount of vascularization and the components of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the materials being used to deliver these cells must be biocompatible with a defined chemical composition while maintaining a mechanical strength that mimics the host tissue. These materials must also be permeable to oxygen and nutrients to provide a favorable microenvironment for cells to attach and proliferate. Chitosan, a cationic polysaccharide with excellent biocompatibility, can be easily chemically modified and has a high affinity to bind with in vivo macromolecules. Chitosan mimics the glycosaminoglycan portion of the extracellular matrix, enabling it to function as a substrate for cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. In this study we utilize chitosan in the form of microspheres to deliver adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) into a collagen based three-dimensional scaffold. An ideal cell-to-microsphere ratio was determined with respect to incubation time and cell density to achieve maximum number of cells that could be loaded. Once ASC are seeded onto the chitosan microspheres (CSM), they are embedded in a collagen scaffold and can be maintained in culture for extended periods. In summary, this study provides a method to precisely deliver stem cells within a three dimensional biomaterial scaffold.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-06-13", "authors": ["David OZamora", "ShanmugasundaramNatesan", "Robert JChristy"], "doi": "10.3791/3624"}

Restoring the aesthetic function of the soft tissue is as important as restoring the natural tissue function. To address aesthetic issues, injection of hyaluronic acid and collagen and use of artificially synthesized biomaterials and autologous fat tissue grafts is extensive in the clinic, still faces limitations. Achieving minimal morbidity while compensating contour irregularities remains a major challenge because the available reconstruction methods and unsatisfactory biomaterials. Adipose tissue engineering holds great promise for reconstruction, but so far, there was no reports of large-volume engineered adipose tissue. Construction of a large volume of vascularized engineered fat tissue may overcome clinical challenges because vascularization is essential for the survival of engineered fat tissue and its integration with the host tissue. An arteriovenous bundle model for soft tissue has been used in prefabricating a large volume fat tissue with axial vascularization in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), and prefabricated vascularized collagen scaffolds, with perforated chamber and arteriovenous bundle, could generate a large volume of engineered fat tissue with an axial vascular pedicle in vivo. Like vascularized autologous tissue, the new constructs could be transferred to the defective site by local transference or microsurgical techniques.

Recent advances in molecular biology and genetic research have provided better understanding of the pathophysiology of moyamoya disease, but surgical revascularization still remains the preferred treatment for this entity. The present study investigated the clinical course of 106 consecutive patients with moyamoya disease who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with indirect pial synangiosis in 150 hemispheres. The outcomes of surgery on the operated hemisphere were favorable, with no cerebrovascular event during the outpatient follow-up period (mean 58.4 months) in 89.3% (134/150). Two patients suffered hemorrhagic events on the operated hemisphere during the follow-up period (2/150, 1.33%), one of whom suffered deteriorated neurological status after hemorrhage. Despite the favorable long-term outcome, the incidence of temporary neurological deterioration due to cerebral hyperperfusion was 18.0% (27/150), but no patients suffered permanent neurological deterioration directly caused by hyperperfusion. In conclusion, direct/indirect revascularization surgery is a safe and effective treatment for moyamoya disease, although the issue of bleeding/re-bleeding remains to be solved. Postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion and peri-operative infarction are potential complications of this procedure, so we recommend intensive postoperative care and cerebral blood flow measurement in the acute stage, because the management of hyperperfusion is contradictory to that of ischemia.", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "date": "2012-06-13", "authors": ["MikiFujimura", "TeijiTominaga"], "doi": "10.2176/nmc.52.327"}
{"title": "[Development of a method of high-contrasted nuclear medical imaging of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-active tumor by using a pretargeting approach].", "abstract": "In solid tumors, hypoxic regions arise because of an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which is overexpressed in hypoxic regions, was recently reported to be a master transcriptional activator of various genes (such as those involved in glucose metabolism, vascularization, invasion, and metastasis) related to malignant phenotypes. Therefore, the development of techniques for the noninvasive detection of HIF-1-active hypoxic tumor cells is of great interest. Although various modalities are used for molecular imaging in vivo, nuclear medical imaging, which can give information about organ functions, plays a central quantitative role in molecular imaging. However, because radioactive probes become attenuated due to the nuclide-specific half-life, an appropriate probe design and/or imaging method is required to obtain a high-contrasted image within a limited time. My colleagues and I have developed a probe and a method for the rapid detection of HIF-1-active hypoxic regions in tumors. Because the \u03b1 subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1\u03b1) controls the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and is unique in that its degradation is regulated by the oxygen partial pressure, we first developed a fusion protein probe that is degraded similarly as HIF-1\u03b1. Then, to control the biodistribution of radioactivity, we utilized a \"pretargeting method\" that uses a combination of the fusion protein and a small-molecule radioactive probe that can bind to the protein and is rapidly cleared from the blood. Rapid and high-contrast imaging of HIF-1-active tumors can be achieved with this pretargeting method.", "journal": "Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan", "date": "2012-06-13", "authors": ["MasashiUeda"], "doi": "10.1248/yakushi.132.595"}

We hypothesize that nutrient-limiting conditions frequently encountered by cancer cells in poorly vascularized solid tumors might provide an opportunity for developing selective therapy. In this study, we investigated the function and molecular mechanisms of a natural compound, arctigenin, in regulating tumor cell growth. We demonstrated that arctigenin selectively promoted glucose-starved A549 tumor cells to undergo necrosis by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. In doing so, arctigenin elevated cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and blocked cellular energy metabolism in the glucose-starved tumor cells. We also demonstrated that cellular ROS generation was caused by intracellular ATP depletion and played an essential role in the arctigenin-induced tumor cell death under the glucose-limiting condition. Furthermore, we combined arctigenin with the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and examined their effects on tumor cell growth. Interestingly, this combination displayed preferential cell-death inducing activity against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Hence, we propose that the combination of arctigenin and 2DG may represent a promising new cancer therapy with minimal normal tissue toxicity.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2012-06-13", "authors": ["YuanGu", "ChuntingQi", "XiaoxiaoSun", "XiuquanMa", "HaohaoZhang", "LihongHu", "JunyingYuan", "QiangYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2012.06.002"}

During the last two decades, it has been successfully applied for aesthetic contour enhancement and at reconstruction of the facial skeleton. Reports on the long-term host tissue tolerance of Medpor are sparse. Use of foreign materials in nasal reconstruction has always been and still is controversial. The main contra-argument maintains that it is not known how alloplastic materials are tolerated by the human body in the long term. This study brings such data concerning the biocompatibility of Medpor. The author has 16 years of experience working with Medpor implants, including its use in rhinoplasty, chin augmentation, and malar augmentation. In this prospective study from 1996 to 2012, Medpor was used in 118 implants for 102 patients. The most frequent indications were nose deformity (n=61), chin hypoplasia (n=33), and malar hypoplasia (n=6). The follow-up periods ranged from 6 months to 15 years (median, 7 years). Of 42 difficult nasal reconstructions performed with the assistance of Medpor, 28 were catastrophe noses that had undergone two to four previous surgeries elsewhere. A total of 19 patients had saddle nose deformity. Of the nasal reconstructions, 85 % had a smooth clinical course, with results remaining stable during the observation time. Five biopsies confirmed soft tissue ingrowths and collagen deposition, with subsequent vascularization. All complications could be mastered. Two dorsal struts and two chin implants required trimming. Infection occurred in three rhinoplasty cases, and partial extrusion occurred in two cases. All augmented chins and malar prominences were firm and bony-like at palpation. Of the 106 Medpor implants in the followed-up patients, some were trimmed or removed, but 97 implants (91%) remained unchanged. Implantation of porous polyethylene in the facial region is a safe procedure. Currently, Medpor seems to be the best alloplastic material available as a facial bone substitute. It is long-lasting, with a low frequency of complications, morbidity similar to procedures involving autologous grafts, and high overall patient satisfaction.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Our goal was to reduce the time between forearm implantation and orthotopic transplantation and to determine a protocol for safe withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. Following forearm implantation, all transplants became fully revascularized over 2 months. Withdrawal of immunosuppression began 4 months after graft implantation and was completed within 6 weeks in cases 2-4. Repopulation of the mucosal lining by recipient cells, to compensate for the necrosis of the donor mucosa, was not complete. This resulted in partial loss of the allotransplant in patients 2-4. In patient 5, additional measures promoting recipient cell repopulation were made. The trachea may be used as a composite tissue allotransplant after heterotopic revascularization in the forearm.

All infants were diagnosed with stage 3+ ROP for zone I or posterior II. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravitreal pegaptanib (0.3 mg) or bevacizumab (0.625 mg/0.025 ml of solution) with conventional diode laser photocoagulation (Group A, 92 eyes of 46 infants) or laser therapy combined with cryotherapy (Group 8, 82 eyes of 41 infants), bilaterally.

Risk factors and other characteristics of infants include birth weight, gestational age, Apgar score, duration of intubation and hospitalizations, postmenstrual age at treatment, sepsis, surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage. Primary outcome of treatment success was defined as absence of recurrence of stage 3+ ROP in one or both eyes (reccurrence rate = 0) by 55 weeks' postmenstrual age. Treatment failure was defined as the recurrence of neovascularization (reccurrence rate = 1 or 2) in one or both eyes requiring retreatment. The mean follow-up after treatment was 23.5 months (range 4 - 45 months) in the Group A, and 25.2 months in the Group B (range 3 - 48 months).\nFinal favorable anatomic outcome and stable regression of ROP at last control examination have 90.2% of eyes after adjuvant intavitral pagaptanbib or bevacizumab in the Group A, and 62% of eyes after only conventional treatment in the Group B (P = 0.0214).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role played by the mechanosensitivity of the vascular network. In 12 anesthetized rabbits blood flow was recorded from the exclusively muscular masseteric artery in response to brief spontaneous contractions (BSC) of the masseter muscle, artery occlusion (AO), muscle compression (MC), and muscle stretch (MS). Activation of masseter muscle was monitored by electromyography (EMG). Responses to AO were also recorded from the mostly cutaneous facial and the central ear arteries. Five animals were also tested in the awake condition. The hyperemic response to BSC (peak amplitude of 394 \u00b1 82%; time to peak of 1.8 \u00b1 0.8 s) developed with a latency of 300-400 ms from the beginning of the EMG burst and 200-300 ms from the contraction-induced transient flow reduction. This response was neither different from the response to AO (peak amplitude = 426 \u00b1 158%), MC, and MS (P = 0.23), nor from the BSC response in the awake condition. Compared with the masseteric artery, the response to AO was markedly smaller both in the facial (83 \u00b1 18%,) and in the central ear artery (68 \u00b1 20%) (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the rapid contraction-induced hyperemia can be replicated by a variety of stimuli affecting transmural pressure in muscle blood vessels and is thus compatible with the Bayliss effect.

Structurally, the internal architecture of the ovary constantly changes as follicles grow, rupture and transform into corpora lutea in a cyclical manner. Functionally, a variety of regulatory ovarian hormones are sequentially produced, and eggs are periodically released. As a highly vascularized organ, the ovarian structures and functions change in response to external stimuli that include but are not limited to pituitary gonadotropins. Following stimulation, the ovary synthesizes and releases autocrine and paracrine signals that play unique roles in regulating its function. Recent studies have identified endothelins as local regulators in the ovary that modulate multiple cyclic events, such as follicle growth, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, ovulation, corpus luteum formation and luteolysis. Interestingly, in all mammalian species examined to date, a common observation has been made: the ovary produces two pharmacologically similar endothelins (ET-1 and ET-2) but expresses two functionally different endothelin receptors (ET(A) and ET(B)) that often give rise to opposite physiological outcomes following activation by an endothelin.

All eight patients with fistulae, which were iatrogenic or due to foreign bodies, survived without aggressive surgery. For more extensive pathology, a successful outcome was achieved in 32 of the 36 cases when the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract was defunctioned because of the presence of major sepsis or because the healthy vascularized tissue was transposed into the area at risk for further fistula formation. Where less aggressive surgery was performed only 12 of 27 patients survived (P\u2003<\u20030.0001). Esophageal surgeons need to be aware of the late complications and associated atypical symptoms of historical procedures which are no longer in common usage. Where an enteropericardial fistula is present, defunctioning of the upper GI tract or repair with transposition of vascularized tissue gives a better chance of a successful outcome.

All the patients were assessed by contrast-enhanced power Doppler endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combined with pulsed Doppler examinations in the late venous phase. The vascularity index (VI) was calculated before and after injection of second generation microbubble contrast specific agent (SonoVue 2.4 mL), used as a Doppler signal enhancer. Moreover, pulsed Doppler parameters (resistivity and pulsatility indexes) were further calculated. The correlation between power Doppler parameters and pathological/molecular parameters (MVD assessed through immunohistochemistry with CD31 and CD34, as well as VEGF assessed through real-time PCR) was assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for the assessment of prognosis.\nSignificantly statistical correlations were found between post-contrast VI and CD34 (p=0.0226), VEGF (p=0.0231), VEGF-A (p=0.0464) and VEGF-B (p=0.0022) while pre-contrast VI was correlated only with CD34 expression. Pulsatility index and resistivity index were not correlated with MVD or VEGF expression. Survival analysis demonstrated that VEGF-A is an accurate parameter for survival rate (p=0.045), as compared to VEGF (p=0.085) and VEGF-B (p=0.230).

{"title": "High-resolution in-vivo analysis of normal brain response to cranial irradiation.", "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is a widely accepted treatment strategy for many central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. However, despite recognized therapeutic success, significant negative consequences are associated with cranial irradiation (CR), which manifests months to years post-RT. The pathophysiology and molecular alterations that culminate in the long-term detrimental effects of CR are poorly understood, though it is thought that endothelial injury plays a pivotal role in triggering cranial injury. We therefore explored the contribution of bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) in their capacity to repair and contribute to neo-vascularization following CR. Using high-resolution in vivo optical imaging we have studied, at single-cell resolution, the spatio-temporal response of BMDCs in normal brain following CR. We demonstrate that BMDCs are recruited specifically to the site of CR, in a radiation dose and temporal-spatial manner. We establish that BMDCs do not form endothelial cells but rather they differentiate predominantly into inflammatory cells and microglia. Most notably we provide evidence that more than 50% of the microglia in the irradiated region of the brain are not resident microglia but recruited from the bone marrow following CR. These results have invaluable therapeutic implications as BMDCs may be a primary therapeutic target to block acute and long-term inflammatory response following CR. Identifying the critical steps involved in the sustained recruitment and differentiation of BMDCs into microglia at the site of CR can provide new insights into the mechanisms of injury following CR offering potential therapeutic strategies to counteract the long-term adverse effects of CR.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-06-08", "authors": ["KellyBurrell", "Richard PHill", "GelarehZadeh"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0038366"}

We evaluated the effect of reconstructing extensive bone defect in the subtrochanteric area (mean, 6.9 cm) with folded free vascularized fibular graft (FVFG).\nBetween 2001 and 2007, 14 cases of subtrochanteric fractures complicated with huge bone defects treated by folded FVFG transfer in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The defect was reconstructed by folded FVFG transfer and locking plate stabilization in 10 patients with no sign of infection at admission (group 1). In the other four patients presented with infections (group 2), the defect was reconstructed by folded FVFG transfer and external fixator fixation. The average follow-up period was 67.4 months.\nBone union was achieved in all of the cases at an average of 5.4 months (range, 4-6 months). Primarily, bone union was achieved in all of the cases in group 1, but one stress fracture occurred in group 2. The full weight bearing time was 5.4 months (range, 5-6 months) in group 1 and 8.5 months (range, 8-9 months) in group 2. Seven patients in group 1 had the locking plate removed in an average of 27 months (range, 18-38 months). In group 2, the external fixator removal time was 13 months (range, 10-18 months). There was no varus deformity at the final follow-up in group 1. The neck-shaft angle measured during the postoperative period and at final follow-up was 129.6 degrees and 129.4 degrees, respectively. In group 2, the neck-shaft angle at the final follow-up was significantly less than the angle measured at the postoperative period (115.5 vs. 129.5 degree, p = 0.021). The range of motion of the hip and knee joint (extend and flex) was 100 degrees or more in all patients at the final follow-up.\nThe results of this study showed that huge subtrochanteric bone defects reconstructed by folded FVFG and locking plate were highly successful in achieving bone union, reducing risks of postoperative stress fracture and preventing malunion. When huge bone defects in the subtrochanteric area complicated with acute or chronic infections, the technique of external fixator offers an alternative to reconstruct the stability of the proximal femur after folded FVFG.

Here, we utilized hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels to spatially control cellular remodeling during vascular network formation. Specifically, we exploited a secondary radical polymerization to alter the ability of cells to degrade the hydrogel and utilized it to create spatial patterning using light initiation. We first demonstrated the ability of the hydrogel to either support or inhibit in vitro vasculogenesis of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or angiogenesis from ex ovo chorioallantoic membranes. We showed that vascular tube branching and sprouting, which required matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-dependent remodeling, could be achieved in hydrogels formed by primary addition-crosslinking only. Although ECFCs expressed higher levels of MMPs in the hydrogels with the secondary radical crosslinking, the generated kinetic chains disabled cell-mediated remodeling and therefore vascular formation was arrested at the vacuole and lumen stage. We then patterned hydrogels to have regions that either permitted or inhibited cell-mediated degradation during in vitro vasculogenesis or angiogenesis.

Fifteen murine tumours were selected including melanoma (B16), colon (C26, C38, C51), mammary (MA13, MA16, MA16/Adr, MA17, MA17/Adr, MA25, MA44), pancreatic (PO2, PO3), Glasgow osteogenic sarcoma (GOS) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). The tumour vascular density, assessed using the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1; CD31) immunostaining, revealed that B16 melanoma was poorly vascularized (<5 %), whereas the colon and mammary tumours were well vascularized (5-15 %). The most vascularized tumours (>15 %) were the pancreatic tumours (PO2 and PO3), the sarcoma (GOS) and the lung tumour (LLC). The integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and E-selectin, evaluated by immunohistology, showed that 7/15 tumours expressed the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin which was homogeneously distributed on all tumour sections (B16, C26, MA17/Adr, MA25, MA44, PO2, LLC).

However, the assessment of perfusion is challenging, because clinical examination is difficult intraoperatively and often not possible postoperatively.

Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has previously been shown to provide real-time, intraoperative evaluation of vascular perfusion. The present pilot study investigated the ability of NIR imaging to assess the perfusion of vascularized bone flaps.\nVascularized bone flaps were created in female Yorkshire pigs using well-established models for porcine forelimb osteomyocutaneous flap allotransplantation (n = 8) and hindlimb fibula flaps (n = 8). Imaging of the bone flaps was performed during harvest using the FLARE intraoperative fluorescence imaging system after systemic injection of indocyanine green. Perfusion was also assessed using the standard of care by clinical observation and Doppler ultrasonography. NIR fluorescence perfusion assessment was confirmed by intermittent clamping of the vascular pedicle.\nNIR fluorescence imaging could identify bone perfusion at the cut end of the osteotomy site. When the vascular pedicle was clamped or ligated, NIR imaging demonstrated no fluorescence when injected with indocyanine green. With clamp removal, the osteotomy site emitted fluorescence, indicating bone perfusion. The results using fluorescence imaging showed 100% agreement with the clinical observation and Doppler findings.\nVascularized bone transfers have become an important tool in reconstructive surgery; however, no established techniques are available to adequately assess perfusion.

We also investigated the anti-angiogenic properties of TIMP2 via knockout. We hypothesized that the loss of TIMP2 could accelerate osteoarthritis development via promotion of angiogenesis. Loss of TIMP2 led to increased periarticular vascular formation 1 month post DMM, compared to wild-type mice, and did so without altering the expression pattern of matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factors. The increased vascularization eventually resulted in a severe degeneration of the articular surface by 4 months post DMM.

{"title": "Thick acellular heart extracellular matrix with inherent vasculature: a potential platform for myocardial tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "The decellularization of porcine heart tissue offers many opportunities for the production of physiologically relevant myocardial mimetic scaffolds. Earlier, we reported the successful isolation of a thin porcine cardiac extracellular matrix (pcECM) exhibiting relevant bio-mechanical properties for myocardial tissue engineering. Nevertheless, since native cardiac tissue is much thicker, such thin scaffolds may offer limited regeneration capacity. However, generation of thicker myocardial mimetic tissue constructs is hindered by diffusion limitations (~100 \u03bcm), and the lack of a proper vascular-like network within these constructs. In our present work, we focused on optimizing the decellularization procedure for thicker tissue slabs (10-15 mm), while retaining their inherent vasculature, and on characterizing the resulting pcECM. The trypsin/Triton-based perfusion procedure that resulted in a nonimmunogenic and cell-supportive pcECM was found to be more effective in cell removal and in the preservation of fiber morphology and structural characteristics than stirring, sonication, or sodium dodecyl sulfate/Triton-based procedures. Mass spectroscopy revealed that the pcECM is mainly composed of ECM proteins with no apparent cellular protein remains. Mechanical testing indicated that the obtained pcECM is viscoelastic in nature and possesses the typical stress-strain profile of biological materials. It is stiffer than native tissue yet exhibits matched mechanical properties in terms of energy dissipation, toughness, and ultimate stress behavior. Vascular network functionality was maintained to the first three-four branches from the main coronary vessels. Taken together, these results reaffirm the efficiency of the decellularization procedure reported herein for yielding thick nonimmunogenic cell-supportive pcECM scaffolds, preserving both native tissue ultra-structural properties and an inherent vascular network.

{"title": "Current limitations of molecular magnetic resonance imaging for tumors as evaluated with high-relaxivity CD105-specific iron oxide nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Tumor imaging via molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that uses specific superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs) has been addressed in the literature several times in the last 20 years. To our knowledge, none of the reported approaches is currently used for routine clinical diagnostic evaluation, nor are any in clinical development. This raises questions as to whether SPIO-enhanced molecular MRI is sensitive and specific enough for use in clinical practice. The aim of our preclinical study was to investigate the minimum requirements for obtaining sensitive molecular MRI for use in tumor evaluations under optimal conditions. The well-vascularized F9 teratocarcinoma tumor model, which exhibits high levels of the highly accessible target CD105 (endoglin), was used to compare the accumulation and visualization of target-specific SPIOs by MRI.\nSuperparamagnetic iron oxide particles were optimized in the following ways: (a) proton relaxivity was increased for higher imaging sensitivity, (b) a coating material was used for optimal loading density of the \u03b1CD105 antibody, and (c) binding activity to the target CD105 was increased. Binding activity and specificity were confirmed in vitro using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vivo using pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies of 11 F9 teratoma-bearing mice together with micro-autoradiography. CD105 target expression was determined using immunohistochemistry and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The transverse relaxation rate R2* was quantified by 3.0-T MRI in the tumors, kidneys, and muscles before and up to 60 minutes after injection in 11 mice. The use of [Fe]-labeled SPIOs for all in vivo experiments allowed for the direct correlation of the imaging results with SPIO accumulation.\nHigh-relaxivity \u03b1CD105-polyacrylic acid-SPIOs (r2 up to 440 L mmol Fe s) with strong binding activity accumulated specifically in tumors (1.4% injected dose/g) and kidneys (4.1% injected dose/g) in a manner dependent on the target concentration. The accumulation occurred within the first 3 minutes after injection. Visualization of specific SPIOs was accomplished with MRI. In contrast to the successful use of MRI in all examined kidneys (mean \u00b1 SEM \u0394R2*, 61 \u00b1 11 s), only 6 of 11 tumors (mean \u00b1 SEM \u0394R2*, 15 \u00b1 7 s) showed a clear signal when compared with the control even though optimal conditions were used.\nThe accumulation of CD105-specific SPIOs in F9 mouse teratomas was robust. However, visualization of the specifically accumulated SPIOs by MRI was not reliable because of its limited signal detection sensitivity. We postulate that it will be challenging to improve the imaging properties of targeted SPIOs further. Therefore, molecular MRI by targeted SPIOs is currently not suitable for clinical tumor imaging using routinely applicable sequences and field strength.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2012-06-05", "authors": ["KatrinDassler", "FarnooshRoohi", "JessicaLohrke", "AndreasIde", "StefanieRemmele", "JoachimH\u00fctter", "HubertusPietsch", "UlrichPison", "GunnarSch\u00fctz"], "doi": "10.1097/RLI.0b013e31824c5a57"}

Main manifestations include central nervous system (CNS) and retinal haemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. RCC has become the first potential cause of mortality and VHL disease is the main cause of inherited RCC. The disease is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene that plays a major role in regulation of the oxygen-sensing pathway by targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF for degradation in proteasome. VHL has also major HIF-independent functions, specially in regulation of primary cilium, extracellular matrix and apoptosis. Somatic inactivation of the VHL gene is the main molecular event in most sporadic RCC and the treatment of advanced RCC has been revolutionized by targeted therapy with drugs that block angiogenesis.

Therefore, to restore fertility in these patients, we aim to develop a biodegradable artificial ovary that offers an environment where isolated follicles and ovarian cells (OCs) can survive and grow. Four NMRI mice were ovariectomized and their ovaries used to isolate OCs. Groups of 50,000 OCs were embedded in an alginate-matrigel matrix for further fixation (fresh controls), one week of in vitro culture (IVC) or heterotopic autografting. OC proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), scaffold degradation, vessel formation (CD34) and inflammation (CD45) were analyzed. Ki67-positive OCs were found in 2.3%, 9.0% and 15.5% cells of cases in fresh, IVC and grafted beads respectively, while cells were TUNEL-positive in 0%, 1.5% and 6.9% of cases. After IVC or grafting, the beads degraded, losing their original round aspect, and infiltrating blood capillaries could be observed in the grafted beads. CD34-positive cells and 22% CD45-positive cells were found around and inside the matrix.

Depending on the location of the pathological entity, various types of surgical corridors are used, such as transcribriform, transplanum transtuberculum, transsellar, transclival, and transodontoid approaches. Often, a large skull base dural defect with a high-flow CSF leak is created after endoscopic skull base surgery. Successful reconstruction of the cranial base defect is paramount to separate the intracranial contents from the paranasal sinus contents and to prevent postoperative CSF leakage. The vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF) has become the workhorse for cranial base reconstruction after endoscopic skull base surgery, dramatically reducing the rate of postoperative CSF leakage since its implementation. In this report, the authors review the surgical technique and describe the operative nuances and lessons learned for successful multilayered PNSF reconstruction of cranial base defects with high-flow CSF leaks created after endoscopic skull base surgery. The authors specifically highlight important surgical pearls that are critical for successful PNSF reconstruction, including target-specific flap design and harvesting, pedicle preservation, preparation of bony defect and graft site to optimize flap adherence, multilayered closure technique, maximization of the reach of the flap, final flap positioning, and proper bolstering and buttressing of the PNSF to prevent flap dehiscence.

{"title": "Cotransplantation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells in a modular construct drives vascularization in SCID/bg mice.", "abstract": "A modular approach to adipose tissue engineering was explored by embedding adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSC) in sub-mm-sized collagen rods or \"modules\" and coating with human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). After subcutaneous injection into a SCID/Bg mouse, HMEC on modules containing embedded adMSC appeared to detach from the modules to form vessels as early as day 3, as confirmed by the human EC-specific UEA-1 lectin stain, and these vessels persisted for up to 90 days. Vessel numbers decreased over 14 days, but vessel size increased suggesting a maturing of the vasculature. Vessel perfusion with the host was confirmed at 21 days by microCT. HMEC on modules without embedded adMSC remained attached to the module surface at day 3 and UEA-1 staining disappeared over 14 days suggesting cell death. It appeared that cotransplantation with adMSC had an anti-apoptotic and proangiogenic effect on HMEC. The early revascularization strategy may be successful in supporting adMSC viability and differentiation, as a preliminary study suggests progressive fat accumulation in the HMEC+adMSC implants: \u223c60% of the implant area stained positive for Oil Red O by day 90. adMSC-embedded modules without HMEC surface coating did not show similar levels of Oil Red O staining. All implant volumes decreased over the time course of the experiment, yet HMEC+adMSC module implants were larger than adMSC-only implants at day 90.

The protection has been demonstrated to involve release of paracrine factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, factors important for successful tissue engineering. The aim of the present study was to determine whether IPC of a vascular bed in vivo is an effective strategy to prepare it for tissue engineering with implanted cells. To test this hypothesis, an in vivo vascularized tissue engineering approach was employed, whereby polyacrylic chambers were placed around the femoral vessels of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. IPC was induced by 3 cycles of 5\u2009min femoral artery occlusion interspersed with 5-min periods of reperfusion. Rats subjected to IPC generated bigger tissue constructs at 7 and 28 days postimplantation of empty chambers (\u223c50% increase in weight and volume, p<0.05). Morphometric counting of Masson trichrome stained tissue sections revealed significantly greater tissue construct volumes in ischemic preconditioned vascular beds at 7 and 28 days, increasing both fibrin matrix and vascularized tissue. Furthermore, morphometry of lectin-labeled blood vessels indicated an increase in vascular volume in IPC tissue constructs (\u223c100% increase vs. control, p<0.05). To investigate the cytoprotective effect of IPC, we implanted DiI-labeled neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in the chambers for 3 days, and IPC significantly reduced apoptosis of implanted cells as determined by the TUNEL assay and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining. Furthermore, IPC significantly increased the cardiac muscle volume and vascular volume at 28 days after implantation of cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis in radiological studies. Part I: Formation of inflammatory infiltrates within the synovial membrane.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial etiology and varied course, which in the majority of patients leads to partial disability or to permanent handicap. Its characteristic trait is a persistent inflammation of the synovial membrane and the formation of an invasive synovial tissue, called the pannus, which in time leads to destruction of the cartilage, subchondral bone tissue, and the soft tissue of the affected joint(s). The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is complex and involves cells of both innate and adaptive immunity, a network of various cytokines and an immunoregulatory dysfunction. An important role in the discovery of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis was played by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed the disease process to extend beyond the synovium into the bone marrow. Many studies have shown a strict correlation between the vascularity of the synovium (assessed through the power Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance examinations), bone marrow edema and the clinical, laboratory and histopathological parameters of rheumatoid arthritis. From the current understanding of rheumatoid arthritis, bone erosions could occur from two directions: from the joint cavity and from the bone marrow. With power Doppler ultrasound, as well as in magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to visualize the well-vascularized pannus and its destructive effects on joint structures and ligaments. In addition, the magnetic resonance study shows inflammatory and destructive changes within the bone marrow (bone marrow edema, inflammatory cysts, and erosions). Bone marrow edema occurs in 68-75% of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and is considered to be a predictor of rapid disease progression.\nReumatoidalne zapalenie staw\u00f3w jest przewlek\u0142\u0105 chorob\u0105 zapaln\u0105 o wieloczynnikowej patogenezie i zr\u00f3\u017cnicowanym przebiegu, kt\u00f3ra u wi\u0119kszo\u015bci chorych prowadzi do cz\u0119\u015bciowej niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015bci lub trwa\u0142ego kalectwa.

{"title": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor antagonist blocks the development of endometriosis in vivo.", "abstract": "Endometriosis, a disease of reproductive age women, is a major cause of infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic pain. Little is known about its etiopathology, but chronic pelvic inflammation is a common feature in affected women. Beside symptomatic treatment of endometriosis-associated pain, only two main suboptimal therapeutic approaches (hormonal and invasive surgery) are generally recommended to patients and no specific targeted treatment is available. Our studies led to the detection of a marked increase in the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the eutopic endometrium, the peripheral blood and the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis, and in early, vascularized and active endometriotic lesions. Herein, we developed a treatment model of endometriosis, where human endometrial tissue was first allowed to implant into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice, to assess in vivo the effect of a specific antagonist of MIF (ISO-1) on the progression of endometriosis and evaluate its efficacy as a potential therapeutic tool. Administration of ISO-1 led to a significant decline of the number, size and in situ dissemination of endometriotic lesions. We further showed that ISO-1 may act by significantly inhibiting cell adhesion, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and inflammation as well as by altering the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. Actually, mice treatment with ISO-1 significantly reduced the expression of cell adhesion receptors \u03b1v and \u00df3 integrins (P<0.05), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 (P<0.05), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) (P<0.01), interleukin 8 (IL8) (P<0.05), cyclooxygenease (COX)2 (P<0.001) and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 (P<0.01), but significantly induced the expression of Bax (P<0.05), a potent pro-apoptotic protein.

The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic efficacy of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], an endogenous peptide hormone, in human prostate cancer xenografts.\nHuman LNCaP prostate cancer cells were injected into the flank of athymic mice and tumors were treated with Ang-(1-7) for 54 days. Tumor growth and angiogenesis were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot hybridization.\nAng-(1-7) markedly reduced the volume and wet weight of LNCaP xenograft tumors. Histological analysis of tumor sections from saline-treated mice showed increased Ki67 immunoreactivity and enhanced phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 compared to tumors from Ang-(1-7)-treated mice, suggesting that the heptapeptide reduces cell proliferation. Intratumoral vessel density was decreased in Ang-(1-7)-treated mice with an associated reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), suggesting that the heptapeptide attenuates vascularization by reducing angiogenic factors. Ang-(1-7) administration markedly increased the soluble fraction of VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1), with a concomitant reduction in VEGF receptors 1 and 2. sFlt-1 serves as a decoy receptor that traps VEGF and PlGF, making the ligands unavailable to membrane-bound VEGF receptors and preventing activation of pro-angiogenic signaling.\nThe decrease in PlGF and VEGF coupled with the increase in sFlt-1 suggests that Ang-(1-7) may serve as a novel anti-angiogenic therapy for prostate cancer. Further, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action by Ang-(1-7) may limit angiogenic resistance that occurs with VEGF inhibitors or receptor blockers.", "journal": "The Prostate", "date": "2012-05-31", "authors": ["BhavaniKrishnan", "Frank MTorti", "Patricia EGallagher", "E AnnTallant"], "doi": "10.1002/pros.22540"}

Ixodes scapularis and Dermacentor albipictus are both hard ticks commonly found feeding on deer harvested at Letterkenny Army Depot, in south central Pennsylvania, USA. The two species have contrasting life histories resulting in D. albipictus spending notably more time on the shared host. We hypothesized that this would give D. albipictus an advantage in locating and occupying optimal attachment sites (highly vascularized areas like the head and ears). Ticks were collected from 224 hunter-killed deer in December 2005 and November 2006 to determine if there is evidence of competition for attachment sites when these two species concurrently infest deer. A timed sample (3\u00a0min per region) of representative ticks was collected from the head (ears, face and neck regions) and body (axillae regions). Ixodes scapularis was more abundant and prevalent overall than D. albipictus. Dermacentor albipictus was found almost exclusively on the head, whereas I. scapularis was more evenly distributed, but somewhat more abundant on the body than on the head. The proportion of I. scapularis on the head was reduced at high D. albipictus abundances, but I. scapularis abundance did not alter the distribution of D. albipictus.

{"title": "Mechanisms and targets of angiogenesis and nerve growth in osteoarthritis.", "abstract": "During osteoarthritis (OA), angiogenesis is increased in the synovium, osteophytes and menisci and leads to ossification in osteophytes and the deep layers of articular cartilage. Angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors might both be upregulated in the osteoarthritic joint; however, vascular growth predominates, and the articular cartilage loses its resistance to vascularization. In addition, blood vessel growth is increased at--and disrupts--the osteochondral junction. Angiogenesis in this location is dependent on the creation of channels from subchondral bone spaces into noncalcified articular cartilage. Inflammation drives synovial angiogenesis through macrophage activation. Blood vessel and nerve growth are linked by common pathways that involve the release of proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, \u03b2-nerve growth factor and neuropeptides. Proangiogenic factors might also stimulate nerve growth, and molecules produced by vascular cells could both stimulate and guide nerve growth. As sensory nerves grow along new blood vessels in osteoarthritic joints, they eventually penetrate noncalcified articular cartilage, osteophytes and the inner regions of menisci. Angiogenesis could, therefore, contribute to structural damage and pain in OA and provide potential targets for new treatments.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

In particular, the VEGF released from the hydrogel induces cell proliferation when tested on HUVECs, retains its bioactivity up to 21days, as demonstrated by Matrigel assay, and, when implanted on a chorion allantoic membrane, the hydrogel shows superior angiogenic potential in stimulating new vessel formation compared with unfunctionalized hydrogels.

A dimeric complex formed by the envelope glycoproteins H and L (gH-gL) is required for entry of herpesviruses into host cells(4). We show that the ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) is a cellular receptor for KSHV gH-gL. EphA2 co-precipitated with both gH-gL and KSHV virions. Infection of human epithelial cells with a GFP-expressing recombinant KSHV strain, as measured by FACS analysis, was increased upon overexpression of EphA2. Antibodies against EphA(2) and siRNAs directed against EphA2 inhibited infection of endothelial cells. Pretreatment of KSHV with soluble EphA2 resulted in inhibition of KSHV infection by up to 90%. This marked reduction of KSHV infection was seen with all the different epithelial and endothelial cells used in this study. Similarly, pretreating epithelial or endothelial cells with the soluble EphA2 ligand ephrinA4 impaired KSHV infection. Deletion of the gene encoding EphA2 essentially abolished KSHV infection of mouse endothelial cells. Binding of gH-gL to EphA2 triggered EphA2 phosphorylation and endocytosis, a major pathway of KSHV entry(5,6). Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ histochemistry revealed a close correlation between KSHV infection and EphA2 expression both in cultured cells derived from human Kaposi's sarcoma lesions or unaffected human lymphatic endothelium, and in situ in Kaposi's sarcoma specimens, respectively.

Until now, little has been known about how nanotopography affects the proliferation and endothelial differentiation of ADSCs. In the present study, two nanograting substrates with a period (ridge and groove) of about 250 and 500 nm, respectively, were fabricated on quartz and their effect on ADSC fate was investigated. The results showed that proliferation of ADSCs on nanograting substrates decreased while cell attachment was not significantly affected compared to a flat substrate. Endothelial differentiation of ADSCs on both flat and nanograting substrates can be induced with vascular endothelial growth factor, as shown by immunofluorescent staining. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed significantly enhanced upregulation of vWF, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin at the gene level by ADSCs on the nanograting substrates. In vitro angiogenesis assay on Matrigel showed that nanograting substrates enhanced capillary tube formation.

However, the effect of endothelial cells on osteogenesis is unknown when placed in poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) scaffolds alone. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have the ability to differentiate into both osteoblasts and endothelial cells by culture in specific media. We hypothesized that ASC-derived endothelial cells would improve vascularity with minimal contribution to bone formation when placed in scaffold alone. ASCs were successfully differentiated into endothelial cells (ASC-Endo) and osteoblasts (ASC-Osteo) using media supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenic protein 2, respectively. Tissue-engineered constructs were created with PLA matrices containing no cells (control), undifferentiated ASCs (ASCs), osteogenic-differentiated ASCs (ASC-Osteo), or endothelial differentiated ASCs (ASC-Endo), and these constructs were evaluated in critical-size Lewis rat calvarial defect model (n = 34). Eight weeks after implantation, the bone volume and microvessel population of bony constructs were evaluated by micro-computed tomography analysis and histologic staining. Bone volumes for ASCs and ASC-Osteo constructs, 0.7 and 0.91 mm(3), respectively, were statistically greater than that for ASC-Endo, 0.28 mm(3) (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the PLA control (0.5 mm(3)) and ASC-Endo (0.28 mm(3)) constructs in bone formation. The percent area of microvessels within constructs was highest in the ASC-Endo group, although it did not reach statistical significance (0.065).

We performed an anatomic study of a naso-labio-mental composite flap vascularized by the facial artery.\nThe study relied on arteriographies made on cadaveric heads and in vivo. The following data was analyzed: caliber of facial and maxillary arteries, terminal branch of facial arteries, and vascular territories.\nSixteen facial arteries and six maxillary arteries were studied. The mean facial artery caliber was 2.06 mm (1-3.2mm). The facial artery ended in the nasal area in 68.8% of the cases. The latero-nasal artery was always present; it was a branch of the facial artery in 66.7% of cases. The two facial arteries, when injected bilaterally, always allowed complete facial composite flap circulation. The nasal territory of the flap was not opacified by the homolateral facial artery in 16.7% of the cases.\nBoth facial artery anastomoses are recommended as blood supply for composite midfacial flaps.

Computer-aid image processing and analysis for retinal vessels in fundus images are effective and efficient in clinical diagnosis instead of tedious manual labeling and measurement. An automated computational framework for retinal vascular network labeling and analysis is presented in this work. The framework includes 1) detecting and locating the optic disc; 2) tracking the vessel centerline from detected seed points and linking the breaks after tracing; 3) extracting all the retinal vascular trees and identifying all the significant points; and 4) classifying terminal points into starting points and ending points based on the information of optic disc location, and finally assigning branch order for each extracted vascular tree in the image. All the modules in the framework are fully automated. Based on the results, morphological analysis is then applied to achieve geometrical and topological features based on branching order for one individual vascular tree or for the vascular network through the retinal vascular network in the images.

Although tumor progression is known to be correlated with intratumoral and plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, the role of tumor induced-angiogenesis remains unclear in these tumors. We analyzed the vascular network in a cohort of 73 clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases using endothelial immunostaining. We studied protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, Von Hippel Lindau, and carbonic anhydrase IX by immunohistochemistry, Von Hippel Lindau gene alteration by sequencing, deletion- and methylation-specific Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification, and gene expression by pangenomic microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a subcohort of 39 clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases. We described 2 distinct angiogenic phenotypes in comparison with the normal kidney vasculature: low and high angiogenic phenotypes. The low angiogenic phenotype was associated with more aggressive prognostic factors such as T3 to T4 (62% versus 31%, P=.002), N+ (29% versus 3% P=.004), M+ (53% versus 21%, P=.004) stages, Fuhrman grade (grade 3-4: 91% versus 36%, P<.001), and intratumoral vascular endothelial growth factor expression (74% versus 28%, P<.001); was less associated with Von Hippel Lindau inactivation (56% versus 80%, P=.03); and was a predictor of poor prognosis in terms of progression-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival (log-rank test, P=.002, P=.011, and P=.035, respectively). The low angiogenic phenotype was also associated with a relative down-regulation of gene expression (platelet-derived growth factor D, N-acetyl transferase 8, and N-acetyl transferase 8 B).

{"title": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination of the breast: a literature review.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the basis for neoplastic growth in human tissues. Nevertheless, neovascularization may be present both in benign and malignant lesions. Although microvascular density assessment is a useful tool for the study of neoplastic vascularization, it cannot be used on a large scale because of the invasiveness of the method. When contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was introduced in clinical practice, the initial results in the field of breast lesions were disappointing because differentiation between benign and malignant masses was not possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of the microvascular features was therefore immediately accepted because of the higher diagnostic accuracy. However, in the last decade the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS have greatly improved due to the development of more sophisticated ultrasound (US) equipment, the introduction of second-generation contrast agents and the development of dedicated software able to perform quantitative analysis. This literature review compares the main results reported in the literature regarding the use of CEUS for the characterization of neoplastic lesions of the breast. All the authors agreed that malignant lesions show early wash-in with more intense enhancement and fast wash-out in comparison with benign masses. However, there is still no observer agreement regarding vascularization patterns, and different classifications are proposed. The conclusion of this literature review is therefore that the clinical role of CEUS in the diagnostic process and in follow-up is still to be clearly defined.\nDie Angiogenese ist die Ursache f\u00fcr neoplastische Wucherungen im humanen Gewebe.

Correct selection of the MSCs source is crucial in order to obtain a more efficient treatment and, in this respect Periosteum-Derived Cells (PDPCs) may represent an interesting alternative to bone marrow MSCs for osteochondral tissue regeneration. In the present study we have isolated and characterized a MSCs population from the periosteum of human adult donors. PDPCs were expanded under specific culture conditions that prevent fibroblast contamination and support the maintenance of their undifferentiated phenotype. We show, for the first time, that PDPCs expresses VEGF receptor (Flt1 and KDR/Flk1) proteins and that they were similar to bone marrow Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs). Since the latter are able to differentiate into endothelial cells, we tested the possible PDPCs commitment toward an endothelial phenotype in view of bone tissue engineering approaches that takes into account not only bone formation but also vascularization. PDPCs were treated with two different VEGF concentrations for 7 and 15 days and, alternatively, with the supernatant of human primary osteoblasts. Differently from MAPCs our PDPCs were unable to differentiate into endothelial cells after their in vitro VEGF treatment. On the contrary, growth factor stimulation induces PDPCs differentiation toward osteoblasts.

{"title": "Galectin-1 in melanoma biology and related neo-angiogenesis processes.", "abstract": "Aggressiveness of advanced melanomas relates in part to their marked propensity to develop neoangiogenesis and metastases. Among its numerous pro-cancer roles, galectin (gal)-1 expressed and/or secreted by both cancer and endothelial cells stimulates proliferation and angiogenesis. This study first shows that gal-1 is more highly expressed at both mRNA and protein levels than its congeners in melanomas and particularly in advanced lesions. The roles of gal-1 were further investigated in vivo in the highly proliferating and vascularized pseudometastatic B16F10 mouse melanoma model using stable knockdown B16F10 cells and wild-type versus gal-1 knockout mice, and then in vitro in B16F10 tumoral and lung microvascular cells. Gal-1 depletion in the B16F10 tumor cells but not in the tumor-bearing mice significantly increased melanoma-bearing mice survival. Tumor-derived gal-1 thus seems to have more critical roles than the host-derived one. In fact, gal-1 displays distinct effects on the H-Ras-dependent p53/p21 pathways: in primary lung microvessel endothelial cells, gal-1 seems to be involved in the maintenance of senescent status through the induction of both p53 and p21 while it stimulates B16F10 cancer cell proliferation through a p53/p21 decrease.

Tumor vascularization is recognized as an important physiological feature likely to impact on both RT and ADT response, and this study therefore aimed to characterize the vascular responses to RT and ADT in experimental PC.\nUsing mice implanted with CWR22 PC xenografts, vascular responses to RT and ADT by castration were visualized in vivo by DCE MRI, before contrast-enhancement curves were analyzed both semi-quantitatively and by pharmacokinetic modeling. Extracted image parameters were correlated to the results from ex vivo quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis (qIHC) of tumor vascularization (9\u2009F1), perfusion (Hoechst 33342), and hypoxia (pimonidazole), performed on tissue sections made from tumors excised directly after DCE MRI.\nCompared to untreated (Ctrl) tumors, an improved and highly functional vascularization was detected in androgen-deprived (AD) tumors, reflected by increases in DCE MRI parameters and by increased number of vessels (VN), vessel density (VD), and vessel area fraction (VF) from qIHC. Although total hypoxic fractions ( HF) did not change, estimated acute hypoxia scores (AHS)--the proportion of hypoxia staining within 50\u2009\u03bcm from perfusion staining--were increased in AD tumors compared to in Ctrl tumors. Five to six months after ADT renewed castration-resistant (CR) tumor growth appeared with an even further enhanced tumor vascularization. Compared to the large vascular changes induced by ADT, RT induced minor vascular changes. Correlating DCE MRI and qIHC parameters unveiled the semi-quantitative parameters area under curve (AUC) from initial time-points to strongly correlate with VD and VF, whereas estimation of vessel size (VS) by DCE MRI required pharmacokinetic modeling.

In skin, ADAM-15 is detected in the epidermis and dermal vascular structures by immunolocalization. Expression is also detected in isolated fibroblast, keratinocytes and endothelial cells in culture. Despite high expression of ADAM-15 throughout the wound repair process, wound healing experiments in vivo revealed a dispensable role of ADAM-15 for the healing process. No alterations in wound closure, re-epithelialization, contraction, scar formation and angiogenesis were detected in animals carrying ADAM-15-/- deletion. When analysing melanoma development by grafting melanoma cells into the flank of ADAM-15-/-, no significant alteration in tumor growth was detected. However, at later stages, melanomas in the ADAM-15-/- animals were smaller than those grown in WT animals. At all time points, no significant differences in vascularization of the peritumoral stroma and tumors were detected. Interestingly, we could detect a reduced number of metastasized lungs and lymph nodes in ADAM-15-/- animals as compared to control littermate mice.

{"title": "Vascular development during distraction osteogenesis proceeds by sequential intramuscular arteriogenesis followed by intraosteal angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Vascular formation is intimately associated with bone formation during distraction osteogenesis (DO). While prior studies on this association have focused on vascular formation locally within the regenerate, we hypothesized that this vascular formation, as well as the resulting osteogenesis, relies heavily on the response of the vascular network in surrounding muscular compartments. To test this hypothesis, the spatiotemporal sequence of vascular formation was assessed in both muscular and osseous compartments in a murine model of DO and was compared to the progression of osteogenesis. Micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) scans were performed sequentially, before and after demineralization, on specimens containing contrast-enhanced vascular casts. Image registration and subtraction procedures were developed to examine the co-related, spatiotemporal patterns of vascular and osseous tissue formation. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the contributory roles of arteriogenesis (formation of large vessels) and angiogenesis (formation of small vessels) to overall vessel formation. Mean vessel thickness showed an increasing trend during the period of active distraction (p=0.068), whereas vessel volume showed maximal increases during the consolidation period (p=0.009). The volume of mineralized tissue in the regenerate increased over time (p<0.039), was correlated with vessel volume (r=0.59; p=0.025), and occurred primarily during consolidation. Immunohistological data suggested that: 1) the period of active distraction was characterized primarily by arteriogenesis in the surrounding muscle; 2) during consolidation, angiogenesis predominated in the intraosteal region; and 3) vessel formation proceeded from the surrounding muscle into the regenerate. These data show that formation of vascular tissue occurs in both muscular and osseous compartments during DO and that periods of intense osteogenesis are concurrent with those of angiogenesis. The results further suggest the presence of morphogenetic factors that coordinate the development of vascular tissues from the intramuscular compartment into the regions of osseous regeneration.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2012-05-24", "authors": ["Elise FMorgan", "Amira IHussein", "Bader AAl-Awadhi", "Daniel EHogan", "HidenoriMatsubara", "ZainabAl-Alq", "JenniferFitch", "BillyAndre", "KrutikaHosur", "Louis CGerstenfeld"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2012.05.008"}

The bone defects in the left mandible were divided into three groups and treated as follows: PLGC membrane alone, PLGC membrane plus autogenous cortical bone chips, and titanium-reinforced expanded PTFE (TR-PTFE) membrane. The bone defects in the right mandible of each animal were left without membranes as a control. Computed tomography (CT) was performed at 3 and 6 months postoperative to evaluate bone regeneration. After a healing period of 6 months, the mandibles were removed en bloc for micro-CT and histologic analyses.\nCT analyses at 3 and 6 months showed that there was significantly more bone augmentation at all experimental sites than at the control sites. The volume of bone at defect sites covered with TR-PTFE was significantly greater than at defect sites covered with PLGC membrane with or without autogenous cortical bone. Micro-CT measurements showed that the volume of new bone formed at sites covered with TR-PTFE was significantly greater than at sites covered with PLGC membrane. However, the density of new bone was significantly higher at sites covered with PLGC membrane, with or without cortical bone, than at sites covered with TR-PTFE.

Although Notch3 receptor expression is high in smooth muscle, Notch3 mutant mice are viable and display only mild defects in vascular patterning and smooth muscle differentiation. Notch2 is also expressed in smooth muscle and Notch2 mutant mice show cardiovascular abnormalities indicative of smooth muscle defects. Together, these findings infer that Notch2 and Notch3 act together to govern vascular development and smooth muscle differentiation. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the phenotype of mice with a combined deficiency in Notch2 and Notch3. Our results show that when Notch2 and Notch3 genes are simultaneously disrupted, mice die in utero at mid-gestation due to severe vascular abnormalities. Assembly of the vascular network occurs normally as assessed by Pecam1 expression, however smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessels are grossly deficient leading to vascular collapse. In vitro analysis show that both Notch2 and Notch3 robustly activate smooth muscle differentiation genes, and Notch3, but not Notch2 is a target of Notch signaling.

If we could enhance new osteogenic activities and prevent progression of osteolytic change by malignant cells, patients could achieve satisfactory activity of daily living. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), which leads to bone formation by osteoblasts, has been used for the treatment of fractures. LIPUS has been reported to enhance the effect of an anticancer drug on lymphoma and liver cancer cells. However, there have been no reports of proliferation, vascularization and migration effects on cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of LIPUS treatment on cancer and osteosarcoma cells and specifically whether it promotes bone formation without accelerating proliferation of tumor cells. We used MC3T3-E1 cells, a mouse osteoblast cell line, LM8, a mouse osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS2, a human osteosarcoma cell line, 786-O, a human renal cancer cell line, PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, and A549, a human lung cancer cell line. The expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), Akt, \u03b2-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cell migration were analyzed. LIPUS stimulation did not affect proliferation of all the cells examined. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was induced by LIPUS stimulation in MC3T3-E1, LM8, SaOS2 and A549 cells, but not in PC-3 and 786-O cells. LIPUS stimulation did not significantly increase \u03b2-catenin. VEGF protein levels and cell migration were significantly increased only in MC3T3-E1 cells. It may be concluded that LIPUS stimulation on metastatic bone tumors induces differentiation of osteoblasts without proliferation of tumor cells.

Their embryonic origin, from neural crests, explains their multipotency. Up to now, it has been demonstrated that these cells are capable of producing bone tissue, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as a simil-dentin tissue, in vitro. In addition, it has been reported that these cells differentiate into adipocytes, endotheliocytes, melanocytes, neurons, and glial cells and can be easily cryopreserved and stored for long periods of time and retain their multipotency and bone-producing capacity. Moreover, recent attention has been focused on tissue engineering and on the properties of these cells: several scaffolds have been used to promote 3D tissue formation and studies have demonstrated that DPSCs show good adherence and bone tissue formation on microconcavity surface textures. In addition, adult bone tissue with good vascularization has been obtained in grafts. Interestingly, they seem to possess immunoprivileges as they can be grafted into allogenic tissues and seem to exert anti-inflammatory abilities, like many other mesenchymal stem cells. Their recent use in clinical trials for bone repair enforces the notion that DPSCs can be used successfully in patients. Therefore, their isolation, selection, differentiation, and banking are of great importance. The isolation technique used in most laboratories is based on the use of flow cytometry with cell sorter termed FACS (fluorescent activated cell sorter).

These new procedures should be based on biophysical differences among the different cell populations in order to obtain interesting peculiarities for implementation in biomedical/clinical laboratories.

Several genetic mutations have been identified in the Shaker-like K(+) channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) of EA1 individuals, including V408A, which result in remarkable channel dysfunction. By inserting the heterozygous V408A, mutation in one Kv1.1 allele, a mouse model of EA1 has been generated (Kv1.1(V408A/+)). Here, we investigated the neuromuscular transmission of Kv1.1(V408A/+) ataxic mice and their susceptibility to physiologically relevant stressors. By using in vivo preparations of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) nerve-muscle from Kv1.1(+/+) and Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice, we show that the mutant animals exhibit spontaneous myokymic discharges consisting of repeated singlets, duplets or multiplets, despite motor nerve axotomy. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy from the motor nerve, ex vivo, revealed spontaneous Ca(2+) signals that occurred abnormally only in preparations dissected from Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice. Spontaneous bursting activity, as well as that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation, was exacerbated by muscle fatigue, ischemia and low temperatures. These stressors also increased the amplitude of compound muscle action potential. Such abnormal neuromuscular transmission did not alter fiber type composition, neuromuscular junction and vascularization of LG muscle, analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Taken together these findings provide direct evidence that identifies the motor nerve as an important generator of myokymic activity, that dysfunction of Kv1.1 channels alters Ca(2+) homeostasis in motor axons, and also strongly suggest that muscle fatigue contributes more than PNS fatigue to exacerbate the myokymia/neuromyotonia phenotype.

Women were assessed in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle by 4D STIC-HDF transvaginal ultrasound. Based on 1-cm(3) spherical sampling, we calculated for each woman the vascularization index (VI) for the most vascularized part of the ovarian stroma in all three-dimensional volumes of the 4D STIC-HDF sequence. The maximum (VI(sys)) and minimum (VI(diast)) values were assumed to represent systole and diastole, respectively, and the mean VI for all frames from one cardiac cycle was calculated. Based on these three VI values, we calculated the following indices: volumetric systolic/diastolic ratio (vS/D), volumetric resistance index (vRI) and volumetric pulsatility index (vPI), and compared them between study and control groups.\nThe study included 32 PCOS women (mean age, 29.6 years) and 32 controls (mean age, 30.4 years).

The exercise group was given voluntary access to a wheel 24 h/day for the duration of the study. Four mice per group were serially killed on days 14, 31, and 36; the remaining 38 mice (exercise, n = 18; control, n = 20) were killed on day 53. Before death, MRI was performed to assess tumor blood perfusion. Primary tumor growth rate was comparable between groups, but expression of prometastatic genes was significantly modulated in exercising animals with a shift toward reduced metastasis. Exercise was associated with increased activity of protein kinases within the MEK/MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling cascades with subsequent increased intratumoral protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. This was associated with improved tumor vascularization. Multiplex ELISAs revealed distinct reductions in plasma concentrations of several angiogenic cytokines in the exercise group, which was associated with increased expression of angiogenic and metabolic genes in the skeletal muscle.

Recently, tubulysins were identified as a novel class of natural compounds of myxobacterial origin, which inhibit tubulin polymerization. As these compounds are structurally highly complex, the search for simplified precursors [e.g. pretubulysin (Prt)] and their derivatives is mandatory to overcome supply problems hampering clinical development. We tested the anti-angiogenic efficacy of Prt and seven of its derivatives in comparison to tubulysin A (TubA).\nThe compounds were tested in cellular angiogenesis assays (proliferation, cytotoxicity, cell cycle, migration, chemotaxis, tube formation) and in vitro (tubulin polymerization). The efficacy of Prt was also tested in vivo in a murine subcutaneous tumour model induced with HUH7 cells; tumour size and vascularization were measured.\nThe anti-angiogenic potency of all the compounds tested ran parallel to their inhibition of tubulin polymerization in vitro. Prt showed nearly the same efficacy as TubA (EC(50) in low nanomolar range in all cellular assays). Some modifications in the Prt molecule caused only a moderate drop in potency, while others resulted in a dramatic loss of action, providing initial insight into structure-activity relations. In vivo, Prt completely prevented tumour growth and reduced vascular density to 30%.\nPrt, a chemically accessible precursor of some tubulysins is a highly attractive anti-angiogenic compound both in vitro and in vivo.

A comparative histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study.", "abstract": "Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumours. They occur sporadically, singly or few in number, and in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal inherited disease. These tumours are composed of different cell types, e.g. nerve cells (axons and axon sheaths), Schwann cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts. The local control of tumour growth in NF1 is poorly understood. Identification of cell markers could provide new information on the processes that are involved in tumour growth.\nNF1 patients were diagnosed according to the revised NF1 diagnostic criteria proposed by the US National Institute of Health. Fifteen cutaneous neurofibromas from eight patients (origin: trunk and face) were excised, immediately immersion-fixed in Bouin's fixative and embedded in paraffin. Six micrometre thin sections were incubated with a variety of neuronal markers, connective tissue and glial cell markers, neurotrophic factors and their receptors. In addition, material was fixed, embedded and further processed for light and electron microscopic studies.\nThe tumours were composed of different cell types, e.g. nerve cells (axons and axon sheaths), Schwann cells, mast cells, compartmentalising cells and fibroblasts. Neuronal markers were identified in axons (neuron-specific protein gene product 9.5, PGP9.5), in several cell types (neurofilament protein-200 kDa, NF-200) and glial cells (protein S-100, S-100). In glial cells the immunoreactivity for fibroblast surface protein (FSP) was scanty, low for cyclic 2,3-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), strong for glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) but lacking for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Schwann cells and so-called compartmentalising cells exhibited immunoreactivity for neurotrophin receptor protein TrkA (TrkA) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF receptor \u03b1-1 (GFR-\u03b11) exhibited distinct immunoreactivity in single axons, in Schwann cells, and with lower intensity in some perineurial sheet cells. No immunoreactivity was observed for the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor protein p75(NTR), high-affinity receptor protein TrkB (TrkB), high-affinity receptor protein TrkC (TrkC), the neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\nHuman cutaneous neurofibromas displayed a pattern of neurotrophic factors and their receptor immunoreactivity, which is characteristic of differentiated non-malignant tumours, and exhibited some differences from that established in developing and differentiated control Schwann cells (probably involved in the pathogenesis of the neurofibromas), as well as tumour cells in the process of differentiation. Neurofibromas are highly vascularized tumours and possess activated endothelial cells and pericytes. We presume that most of the hyperplastic structural components of a neurofibroma are generated from activated pericytes and smooth muscle cells of the small tumour vessels which possess qualities of adult stem cells.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2012-05-18", "authors": ["Reinhard EFriedrich", "Adolf-FriedrichHolstein", "RalfMiddendorff", "Michail SDavidoff"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Relevance of angiogenesis in neuroendocrine tumors.", "abstract": "While traditional cytotoxic drugs have shown limited efficacy in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), their biological features have been characterized and can be exploited therapeutically. Their most prominent trait is an extraordinary vascularization in low-grade NETs and an hypoxia-dependent angiogenesis in high-grade NETs, which is associated to a significant expression of many proangiogenic molecules. Therefore, several antiangiogenic compounds have been tested in these malignancies, and among these, sunitinib has demonstrated activity in pancreatic NET patients by dually targeting the VEGFR and PDGFR pathways. In spite of these efficacious clinical results, apparent resistance to antiangiogenic therapies has been described in NET animal models and in clinical trials. Therefore, overcoming antiangiogenic resistance is a crucial step in the subsequent development of antiangiogenic therapies. Several strategies have been postulated to fight resistance, but preclinical studies and clinical trials will investigate and address these therapeutic approaches in the coming years in order to overcome resistance to antiangiogenic therapies in NETs.", "journal": "Targeted oncology", "date": "2012-05-18", "authors": ["AlexandreTeul\u00e9", "OriolCasanovas"], "doi": "10.1007/s11523-012-0217-x"}

Percent microvascularity, distribution, branching pattern, and diameter of microvessels were determined from images of histochemically stained blubber sections from shallow-diving bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), deeper-diving pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps), deep-diving beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris; Ziphius cavirostris), and the subdermal adipose tissue of domestic pigs (Sus scrofa). Tursiops blubber showed significant stratification in percent microvascularity among the superficial, middle, and deep layers and had a significantly higher percent microvascularity than all other animals analyzed, in which the microvasculature was more uniformly distributed. The percent microvasculature of Kogia blubber was lower than that of Tursiops but higher than that of beaked whales and the subdermal adipose tissue of domestic pigs. Tursiops had the most microvascular branching. Microvessel diameter was relatively uniform in all species. There were no clear patterns associating microvascular and lipid characteristics. The microvascular characteristics of the superficial layer of blubber resembled the adipose tissue of terrestrial mammals, suggesting some conservation of microvascular patterns in mammalian adipose tissue.

{"title": "Role of the VEGF/VEGFR axis in cancer biology and therapy.", "abstract": "New vessel formation (angiogenesis) is an essential physiological process for embryologic development, normal growth, and tissue repair. Angiogenesis is tightly regulated at the molecular level; however, this process is dysregulated in several pathological conditions such as cancer. The imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic signaling molecules within tumors creates an abnormal vascular network that is characterized by dilated, tortuous, and leaky vessels. The pathophysiological consequences of these vascular abnormalities include temporal and spatial heterogeneity in tumor blood flow, oxygenation, and increased tumor interstitial fluid pressure. The resultant microenvironment deeply impacts on tumor progression, and also leads to a reduction in therapy efficacy. The discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a major driver of tumor angiogenesis has led to efforts to develop novel therapeutics aimed at inhibiting its activity. Anti-VEGF therapy has become an important option for the management of several human malignancies; however, a significant number of patients do not respond to anti-VEGF therapy when used either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. In addition, the benefit of antiangiogenic therapy is relatively short lived and the majority of patients relapse and progress.

Early tumor detection is key to ensuring effective treatment. Serum marker discovery and validation for pediatric osteosarcoma has accelerated in recent years, coincident with an evolving understanding of molecules and their complex interactions, and the compelling need for improved pediatric osteosarcoma outcome measures in clinical trials. This review gives a short overview of serological markers for pediatric osteosarcoma, and highlights advances in pediatric osteosarcoma-related marker research within the past year. Studies in the past year involving serum markers in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma can be assigned to one of four categories, i.e., new approaches and new markers, exploratory studies in specialized disease subsets, large cross-sectional validation studies, and longitudinal studies, with and without an intervention.Most of the studies have examined the association of a serum marker with some aspect of the natural history of pediatric osteosarcoma. As illustrated by the many studies reviewed, several serum markers are emerging that show a credible association with disease modification. The expanding pool of informative osteosarcoma-related markers is expected to impact development of therapeutics for pediatric osteosarcoma positively and, it is hoped, ultimately clinical care. Combinations of serum markers of natural immunity, thyroid hormone homeostasis, and bone tumorigenesis may be undertaken together in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma. These serum markers in combination may do better.

{"title": "Imaging response in neuroendocrine tumors treated with targeted therapies: the experience of sunitinib.", "abstract": "Among neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gut, well-differentiated tumors are highly vascularized, featuring specific characteristics on contrast-enhanced imaging. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors spontaneously harbor hypervascular enhancement, coexisting with areas of necrosis mainly located at the center of tumor lesions. When exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as sunitinib, target lesions display few if any variation in tumor size, but rather detectable modifications in tumor density. In several patients treated with targeted therapy, a significant decrease of tumor density at first tumor evaluation can be detected as compared to baseline. Consistently, the two randomized trials leading to approval of sunitinib and everolimus in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors report objective response rate below 10%, emphasizing that Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), that focus only on the largest diameters of target lesions, may be insufficient to capture the full benefit of targeted therapies.

Choi criteria have been recently proposed as a surrogate endpoint for efficacy and to identify patients that are good responders to VEGFR inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, another disease highly addicted to angiogenesis.

{"title": "Role of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in long bone development.", "abstract": "Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was shown to be critical for skeleton development, and TRAP deficiency leads to a reduced resorptive activity during endochondral ossification resulting in an osteopetrotic phenotype and shortened long bones in adult mice. A proper longitudinal growth depends on a timely, well-coordinated vascularization and formation of the secondary ossification center (SOC) of the long bones epiphysis. Our results demonstrate that TRAP is not essential for the formation of the epiphyseal vascular network. Therefore, in wild type (Wt) controls as well as TRAP deficient (TRAP(-/-)) mutants vascularised cartilage canals are present from postnatal day (P) five. However, in the epiphysis of the TRAP(-/-) mice cartilage mineralization, formation of the marrow cavity and the SOC occur prematurely compared with the controls. In the mutant mice the entire growth plate is widened due to an expansion of the hypertrophic zone. This is not seen in younger animals but first detected at week (W) three and during further development. Moreover, an enhanced number of thickened trabeculae, indicative of the osteopetrotic phenotype, are observed in the metaphysis beginning with W three. Epiphyseal excavation was proposed as an important function of TRAP, and we examined whether TRAP deficiency affects this process. We therefore evaluated the marrow cavity volume (MCV) and the epiphyseal volume (EV) and computed the MCV to EV ratio (MCV/EV). We investigated developmental stages until W 12. Our results indicate that both epiphyseal excavation and establishment of the SOC are hardly impaired in the knockouts. Furthermore, no differences in the morphology of the epiphyseal bone trabeculae and remodeling of the articular cartilage layers are noted between Wt and TRAP(-/-) mice. We conclude that in long bones, TRAP is critical for the development of the growth plate and the metaphysis but apparently not for the epiphyseal vascularization, excavation, and establishment of the SOC.", "journal": "Mechanisms of development", "date": "2012-05-15", "authors": ["Michael J FBlumer", "BarbaraHausott", "ChristophSchwarzer", "Alison RHayman", "JudithStempel", "HelgaFritsch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mod.2012.04.003"}

We determined whether recombinant human apolipoprotein(a) kringle V, rhLK8, produces therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic human prostate cancer animal model. Fifty thousand androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2) were injected into the prostate of nude mice. After 3 days, these mice were randomized to receive the vehicle solution (intraperitoneally [i.p.], daily), paclitaxel (8 mg/kg i.p., weekly), rhLK8 (50 mg/kg i.p., daily), or a combination of paclitaxel and rhLK8 for 4 weeks. Treatment with paclitaxel or rhLK8 alone did not show significant therapeutic effects on tumor incidence or on tumor size compared with the control group. The combination of rhLK8 and paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor size and incidence of lymph node metastasis. Significant reduction in microvessel density and cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells, and tumor-associated endothelial cells, were also achieved. Similarly, PC-3MM2 tumors growing in the tibia showed significant suppression of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis by the combination treatment with rhLK8 and paclitaxel. The integrity of the bone was significantly preserved, and apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells was increased. In conclusion, these results suggest that targeting the tumor microenvironment with the antivascular effect of rhLK8 combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy could be a new and effective approach in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer and their metastases.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2012-05-12", "authors": ["Ho-JeongLee", "Hyun-KyungYu", "John NPapadopoulos", "Seung WookKim", "JunqinHe", "Yong-KeunPark", "YeupYoon", "Jang-SeongKim", "Sun JinKim"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.12380"}

{"title": "CCR2 recruits an inflammatory macrophage subpopulation critical for angiogenesis in tissue repair.", "abstract": "Monocytes/macrophages are critical in orchestrating the tissue-repair response. However, the mechanisms that govern macrophage regenerative activities during the sequential phases of repair are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the dynamics and functions of diverse monocyte/macrophage phenotypes during the sequential stages of skin repair. By combining the analysis of a new CCR2-eGFP reporter mouse model with conditional mouse mutants defective in myeloid cell-restricted CCR2 signaling or VEGF-A synthesis, we show herein that among the large number of inflammatory CCR2(+)Ly6C(+) macrophages that dominate the early stage of repair, only a small fraction strongly expresses VEGF-A that has nonredundant functions for the induction of vascular sprouts. The switch of macrophage-derived VEGF-A during the early stage of tissue growth toward epidermal-derived VEGF-A during the late stage of tissue maturation was critical to achieving physiologic tissue vascularization and healing progression. The results of the present study provide new mechanistic insights into CCR2-mediated recruitment of blood monocyte subsets into damaged tissue, the dynamics and functional consequences of macrophage plasticity during the sequential repair phases, and the complementary role of macrophage-derived VEGF-A in coordinating effective tissue growth and vascularization in the context of tissue-resident wound cells.

The EC/PC co-cultures adhered massively on PHMS, with the formation of net-like microcapillary structures. Such evidence was not found on control glass substrates in the same co-culture conditions neither on PHMS for EC and PC in monocultures. The physicochemical characterization of PHMS and control glass surface by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, water contact angle and atomic force microscopy, pointed to the main role of the polymer hydrophobilicy to explain the observed cellular behavior. Moreover, enhanced intercellular cross-talk was evidenced by the up-regulation and activation of cytoplasmic and Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2) and iPLA(2)) expression and cPLA(2) phosphorylation, leading to the cell proliferation and microcapillary formation on the PHMS surface, as evidenced by confocal microscopy analyses. Co-cultures, established with growth-arrested PCs by treatment with mitomycin C, showed an increase in EC proliferation on PHMS. AACOCF(3) or co-transfection with cPLA(2) and iPLA(2)siRNA reduced cell proliferation.

{"title": "Beyond vascularization: aerobic fitness is associated with N-acetylaspartate and working memory.", "abstract": "Aerobic exercise is a promising form of prevention for cognitive decline; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which exercise and fitness impacts the human brain. Several studies have postulated that increased regional brain volume and function are associated with aerobic fitness because of increased vascularization rather than increased neural tissue per se. We tested this position by examining the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the right frontal cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NAA is a nervous system specific metabolite found predominantly in cell bodies of neurons. We reasoned that if aerobic fitness was predominantly influencing the vasculature of the brain, then NAA levels should not vary as a function of aerobic fitness. However, if aerobic fitness influences the number or viability of neurons, then higher aerobic fitness levels might be associated with greater concentrations of NAA. We examined NAA levels, aerobic fitness, and cognitive performance in 137 older adults without cognitive impairment. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we found that higher aerobic fitness levels offset an age-related decline in NAA. Furthermore, NAA mediated an association between fitness and backward digit span performance, suggesting that neuronal viability as measured by NAA is important in understanding fitness-related cognitive enhancement. Since NAA is found exclusively in neural tissue, our results indicate that the effect of fitness on the human brain extends beyond vascularization; aerobic fitness is associated with neuronal viability in the frontal cortex of older adults.", "journal": "Brain and behavior", "date": "2012-05-11", "authors": ["Kirk IErickson", "Andrea MWeinstein", "Bradley PSutton", "Ruchika ShauryaPrakash", "Michelle WVoss", "LauraChaddock", "Amanda NSzabo", "Emily LMailey", "Siobhan MWhite", "Thomas RWojcicki", "EdwardMcAuley", "Arthur FKramer"], "doi": "10.1002/brb3.30"}

{"title": "[Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy].", "abstract": "Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is characterized by a branching vascular network with polypoidal lesions under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In Japan, it is classified as a specific form of exudative age-related macular degeneration. However, several issues which we investigated regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of PCV remain unresolved. We investigated the pathogenesis, clinical findings and treatment of PCV. 1. Indocyanine green angiographic findings. There were two different patterns on indocyanine green angiograms. In the first pattern, both feeder and draining vessels were visible and network vessels showed characteristic findings of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Points of focal dilatation on marginal vessels were comprised of polypoidal lesions. In the second pattern, neither feeder nor draining vessels were visible and there were few network vessels. The points of deformation of network vessels appeared to be polypoidal lesions. The former represents a deformation of CNV, i.e. polypoidal CNV; the latter is thought to result from abnormalities of the choroidal vessels, i.e. PCV in the strict sense. 2. Pathological findings of PCV in the strict sense. The histopathological characteristics of PCV in the strict sense, which had been eliminated by vitrectomy, were dilatation and hyalinization of vessels, massive exudative changes in blood plasma, basement membrane-like deposits and scant granulomatous tissue. These vessels were located beneath Bruch's membrane. The findings indicate that PCV in the strict sense arises from hyalinized arteriolosclerosis of choroidal vessels. 3. Optical coherence tomographic findings. A break was found in the high reflective line which revealed Bruch's membrane. Low reflective tissue was observed at the break corresponding to a feeder vessel. The high reflective line which corresponded to the retinal pigment epithelium was uneven, and highly elevated portions of the RPE corresponded to thick network vessels and polypoidal lesions. Feeder vessels are thought to invade via Bruch's membrane to form network vessels and polypoidal lesions at the termini of the network vessels, both of which push the RPE upward. Therefore, polypoidal CNV is thought to represent a deformation of the CNV under the RPE. In PCV in the strict sense, an irregular thickened line with highly reflective substances adhering to the lower portion of it, curved downward corresponding to the site at which the network vessel filling began. A dimple in the RPE was observed which paralleled the curve of the line. The RPE was pushed upward, corresponding to the network vessels. Judging from the results of histopathological studies, abnormal vessels may be pushed up the RPE secondary to an increase in intravascular pressure due to the presence of several dilated vessels and by massive exudation from these vessels within the choroid at network vessels. The dimple in the RPE might be attributable to intra-choroidal pressure being decreased at the point at which network vessel filling began. 4. Genetic findings. There were significant differences in all distributions of ARMS 2 (A69S) between the polypoidal CNV and control groups. In contrast, the distribution of ARMS 2 (A69S) did not differ between the PCV in the strict sense group and the control group. The ARMS 2 (A69S) gene is closely related to age-related macular degeneration. Polypoidal CNV was thought to be associated with age-related macular degeneration. 5. Treatment of subfoveal PCV. Mean visual acuity improved 1 year after photodynamic therapy (PDT). Good visual acuity, small lesion size of the network of vessels with polypoidal lesions, and the absence of subfoveal polypoidal lesions were pre-PDT predictors that corresponded to the improvement in vision. However, mean visual acuity had decreased to a level similar to that prior to PDT at 2 and 3 years after treatment. In PCV in the strict sense, the branching vascular network persisted after PDT, and polypoidal lesions frequently recurred at the termini. The branching vascular network sometimes expanded and was accompanied by polypoidal CNV or classic CNV. These results indicate that repeated PDT, as monotherapy, has limitations as a long-term treatment for PCV in the strict sense. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab for eyes with a visual acuity of 0.6 or more, which is not a good indication for PDT, achieved improvement in mean visual acuity 1 year after the treatment, though the frequency of polypoidal lesion regression was low. This procedure seems to be useful for eyes with good visual acuity for a period of at least one year. 6. Conclusion. Using indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography and genetic testing, PCV was classified into 2 groups, polypoidal CNV and PCV in the strict sense. PCV in the strict sense was characterized by arteriolsclerosis histopathologically. Polypoidal CNV is thought to represent deformation of CNV under the RPE in age-related macular degeneration, while PCV in the strict sense is thought to be due to choroidal vessel abnormalities. The long-term efficacy of repeated PDT as monotherapy, for subfoveal PCV was limited. Further evaluation is necessary to establish a treatment algorithm for PCV.", "journal": "Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi", "date": "2012-05-10", "authors": ["MitsukoYuzawa"], "doi": "10.4264/numa.71.282"}
{"title": "BMP9 and BMP10 are critical for postnatal retinal vascular remodeling.", "abstract": "ALK1 is a type I receptor of the TGF-\u03b2 family that is involved in angiogenesis. Circulating BMP9 was identified as a specific ligand for ALK1 inducing vascular quiescence. In this work, we found that blocking BMP9 with a neutralizing antibody in newborn mice significantly increased retinal vascular density. Surprisingly, Bmp9-KO mice did not show any defect in retinal vascularization. However, injection of the extracellular domain of ALK1 impaired retinal vascularization in Bmp9-KO mice, implicating another ligand for ALK1. Interestingly, we detected a high level of circulating BMP10 in WT and Bmp9-KO pups. Further, we found that injection of a neutralizing anti-BMP10 antibody to Bmp9-KO pups reduced retinal vascular expansion and increased vascular density, whereas injection of this antibody to WT pups did not affect the retinal vasculature. These data suggested that BMP9 and BMP10 are important in postnatal vascular remodeling of the retina and that BMP10 can substitute for BMP9. In vitro stimulation of endothelial cells by BMP9 and BMP10 increased the expression of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway (Jagged1, Dll4, Hey1, Hey2, Hes1) and decreased apelin expression, suggesting a possible cross-talk between these pathways and the BMP pathway.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["NicolasRicard", "DelphineCiais", "SandrineLevet", "MarielaSubileau", "ChristineMallet", "Teresa AZimmers", "Se-JinLee", "MarieBidart", "Jean-JacquesFeige", "SabineBailly"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2012-01-407593"}

We correlated nasoseptal flap enhancement with postoperative CSF leak rates in a group of skull base reconstruction patients. The nasoseptal flap enhancement was determined by immediate postoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allowed for imaging of the flap's vascular pedicle. Our aim was to identify whether nasoseptal flap enhancement contributed to reduction of postoperative CSF leak rates.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nWe reviewed 19 patients who underwent expanded endoscopic resections of skull base lesions of advanced complexity. We calculated the incidence of CSF leaks and measured the presence of nasoseptal flap enhancement.\nOf the 19 patients with immediate postoperative MRIs, three developed postoperative CSF leaks. All three CSF leaks were in cases with enhancing vascular pedicles. In contrast, we had three patients without evidence of flap enhancement, none of whom developed a postoperative CSF leak (Fisher exact test, P = 1.0). CSF leak was associated with posterior fossa lesions (P = .25). Nasoseptal flap enhancement was associated with younger age (P = .15).\nThis retrospective cohort study demonstrates that although the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap is effective for closure of expanded endonasal skull base procedures, our experience found the actual enhancement of the flap itself does not appear to effect postoperative CSF leak rates.", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["Nithin DAdappa", "Kim OLearned", "James NPalmer", "Jason GNewman", "John Y KLee"], "doi": "10.1002/lary.23351"}
{"title": "Thymic transplantation in pig-to-nonhuman primates for the induction of tolerance across xenogeneic barriers.", "abstract": "With the advent of knockout pigs for \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferease (GalT-KO, which lack a cell-surface antigen to which humans have preformed antibodies), investigators have extended the survival of life-supporting xenorenal grafts. However, despite these increases, nonhuman primates transplanted with GalT-KO renal grafts are susceptible to anti-donor T-cell responses that are strong or stronger than allogeneic responses. In order to prevent rejection, recipients must be subjected to morbidly high levels of immunosuppression. For these reasons, our laboratory has attempted to develop novel methods of xenogeneic tolerance using vascularized porcine thymic grafts in order to reteach the recipient's immune system to accept the xenogeneic organ as self. These strategies, largely developed by Dr. Kazuhiko Yamada, involve the co-transplantation of a vascularized donor thymus with a kidney. This has been successfully done in two ways. The first method involves the preparation of a composite tissue \"thymokidney\" and the second utilizes the transplantation of an isolated vascularized thymic lobe. Both strategies involve the transplantation of fully vascularized thymic tissue at the time of xenotransplantation, a fact which is crucial for function of the thymic tissue immediately after xenografting and reeducation of recipient T-cells. These strategies have successfully induced tolerance across fully allogeneic models in miniature swine and prolonged graft survival in our pig-to-baboon model of life-supporting xenotransplantation to greater than 80 days with in vitro evidence of donor-specific unresponsiveness. Although it is too early for the development of clinical renal xenotransplantation protocols, this chapter describes the authors' unique experience with one of the most promising preclinical large-animal models of xenotransplantation.

A series of functional studies can be conducted with this purpose that include treatment with proinflammatory cytokines and xenogeneic cell-based assays that put together pig cells and human leukocytes such as monocytes, NK cells, and T cells. The choice of the pig cell type is critical to appropriately model the transplant setting of interest. Thus, pig endothelial cells are commonly used for studying the rejection process of vascularized organs. Treatment with cytokines allows studying the regulation of adhesion, costimulatory molecules, and receptors involved in triggering the immune response in an attempt to reproduce the more complex in vivo situation.

In particular, the complement-dependent hemolytic assay (CH50) determines total endogenous complement activity; the cytolytic activity of anti-pig antibodies (APA) is also measured by hemolytic assay; an ELISA is used for quantification of anti-galactose \u03b11,3galactose (Gal) IgG and IgM antibodies and flow cytometry for determining the antiendothelial cell (anti-EC) antibodies. The APA is recommended because this assay measures cytolytic antibodies unlike the other assays which are binding assays. The anti-Gal ELISA is especially useful as it specifically quantifies antibodies against the major xenoantigen in the pig-to-primate transplant combination. Thus, it provides different information than the APA assay and is particularly useful to follow up treatment modalities aimed at blocking/inhibiting the anti-Gal antibodies. Finally, the anti-EC assay measures IgG and/or IgM antibodies reactive to Gal and non-Gal antigens expressed on endothelial cells. This information is key for understanding the rejection process of vascularized xenografts and finding strategies to overcome rejection.

In group 1, solvent-dehydrated human cadaveric cranium allografts (corticocancellous bone) were used. The grafts were divided into 20 pieces, approximately 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 5 mm. On the right ears, grafts were placed on dissected vascular bundles. On their left ears, allografts were implanted into subcutaneous pockets without dissecting any vascular bundle. The same procedure was performed in group 2 with solvent-dehydrated human cadaveric fibula bone allografts (cortical bone). No infection or any animal death occurred during 12 months of observation. At the end of the 12th month, implanted bone allografts were evaluated by 3-phase bone scintigraphy to observe the circulation and viability of the grafts and three-dimensional CT scans to measure their dimensions.\nRadioactive uptake by scintigraphy of grafts placed on vascular bundle was higher than grafts placed in pockets. t-Test was calculated for region of interest of right ear (vascularized) to left ear rate (nonvascularized) according to graft type. Rate for corticocancellous bone graft was 1.187 \u00b1 0.179 (P = 0.038) and cortical bone graft was 1.055 \u00b1 0.052 (P = 0.038). There was correlation between region of interest generated from arm and neck regions and graft regions (P = 0.001). Regarding the dimension measurement made by three-dimensional CT, all the grafts grew whether they were on vascular bundle or not. Mann-Whitney test was used to determine whether differences between preoperative and postoperative volumes of grafts and growth of all grafts were significant (P = 0.007 for vascularized cortical bone and P = 0.005 for others). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to evaluate the distribution of growth rate. Vascularized medullar-cortical and nonvascularized medullar bone grafts expanded more than nonvascularized cortical bone (P = 0.001, P = 0.005, P = 0.001, respectively).\nVascularized bone allograft combines the advantages of autogenous and allogenous grafts. Both scintigraphic and tomographic results overlapped that corticocancellous and cortical bones developed more on vascular bundle. Even though radioactive uptake was statistically higher in vascularized bone allografts, we determined that this small difference did not affect the overall late vascularity of the bone allografts.

{"title": "Time course study of delayed wound healing in a biofilm-challenged diabetic mouse model.", "abstract": "Bacterial biofilm has been shown to play a role in delaying wound healing of chronic wounds, a major medical problem that results in significant health care burden. A reproducible animal model could be very valuable for studying the mechanism and management of chronic wounds. Our previous work showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) biofilm challenge on wounds in diabetic (db/db) mice significantly delayed wound healing. In this wound time course study, we further characterize the bacterial burden, delayed wound healing, and certain aspects of the host inflammatory response in the PAO1 biofilm-challenged db/db mouse model. PAO1 biofilms were transferred onto 2-day-old wounds created on the dorsal surface of db/db mice. Control wounds without biofilm challenge healed by 4 weeks, consistent with previous studies; none of the biofilm-challenged wounds healed by 4 weeks. Of the biofilm-challenged wounds, 64% healed by 6 weeks, and all of the biofilm-challenged wounds healed by 8 weeks. During the wound-healing process, P. aeruginosa was gradually cleared from the wounds while the presence of Staphylococcus aureus (part of the normal mouse skin flora) increased. Scabs from all unhealed wounds contained 10(7) P. aeruginosa, which was 100-fold higher than the counts isolated from wound beds (i.e., 99% of the P. aeruginosa was in the scab). Histology and genetic analysis showed proliferative epidermis, deficient vascularization, and increased inflammatory cytokines. Hypoxia inducible factor expression increased threefold in 4-week wounds. In summary, our study shows that biofilm-challenged wounds typically heal in approximately 6 weeks, at least 2 weeks longer than nonbiofilm-challenged normal wounds. These data suggest that this delayed wound healing model enables the in vivo study of bacterial biofilm responses to host defenses and the effects of biofilms on host wound healing pathways.

The fast degradation of these membranes/matrices combined with transmembrane vascularization within 4 weeks has been observed in rats compared with the slow vascularization and continuous integration observed in mice. The aim of the present study was to analyze the tissue reaction to a porcine-based non-cross-linked collagen I-III membrane in mice. Using a subcutaneous implantation model, the membrane was implanted subcutaneously in mice for up to 60 days. The extent of scaffold vascularization, tissue integration and scaffold thickness were assessed using general and specialized histological methods, together with a unique histomorphometrical analysis technique. A dense Bombyx mori-derived silk fibroin membrane was used as a positive control, whilst a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane served as a negative control. Within the observation period, the collagen membrane induced a mononuclear cellular tissue response, including anti-inflammatory macrophages and the absence of multinucleated giant cells within its implantation bed. Transmembrane scaffold vascularization was not observed, whereas a mild scaffold vascularization was generated through microvessels located at both scaffold surfaces. However, the silk fibroin induced a mononuclear and multinucleated cell-based tissue response, in which pro-inflammatory macrophages and multinucleated giant cells were associated with an increasing transmembrane scaffold vascularization and a breakdown of the membrane within the experimental period. The PTFE membrane remained as a stable barrier throughout the study, and visible cellular degradation was not observed. However, multinucleated giant cells were located on both interfaces. The present study demonstrated that the tested non-cross-linked collagen membrane remained as a stable barrier membrane throughout the study period. The membrane integrated into the subcutaneous connective tissue and exhibited only a mild peripheral vascularization without experiencing breakdown. The silk fibroin, in contrast, induced granulation tissue formation, which resulted in its high vascularization and the breakdown of the material over time. The presence of multinucleated giant cells at both interfaces of the PFTE membrane is a sign of its slow cellular biodegradation and might lead to adhesions between the membrane and its surrounding tissue. This hypothesis could explain the observed clinical complications associated with the retrieval of these materials after guided tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["ShahramGhanaati"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.04.041"}
{"title": "Implication of MEK1 and MEK2 in the establishment of the blood-placenta barrier during placentogenesis in mouse.", "abstract": "The ERK/MAPK signalling cascade is involved in many cellular functions. In mice, the targeted ablation of genes coding for members of this pathway is often associated with embryonic death due to the abnormal development of the placenta. The placenta is essential for nutritional and gaseous exchanges between maternal and embryonic circulations, as well as for the elimination of metabolic waste. These exchanges occur without direct contact between the two circulations. In mice, the blood-placenta barrier consists of a triple layer of trophoblast cells adjacent to endothelial cells from the embryo. In the ERK/MAPK cascade, MEK1 and MEK2 are dual-specificity kinases responsible for the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 kinases. Inactivation of Mek1 causes placental malformations resulting from defective proliferation and differentiation of the labyrinthine trophoblast cells and leading to a severe delay in the development and the vascularization of the placenta, which explains the embryonic death. Although Mek2(-/-) mutants survive without any apparent phenotype, a large proportion of Mek1(+/-)Mek2(+/-) double heterozygous mutants die during gestation from placenta anomalies affecting the establishment of the blood-placenta barrier.

{"title": "Ethanol protects from injury due to ischemia and reperfusion by increasing vascularity via vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "The cardioprotective effects of moderate ethanol consumption have been known for years and have generally been ascribed to long-term effects of alcohol on blood lipids. However, other mechanisms, particularly ethanol-induced increase in blood vessel density, may also be involved. Our goal was to understand the relationship between ethanol consumption, new blood vessel formation in vivo and protection from injury due to ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion. Using paired ethanol fed and control rats, we assessed capillary density in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle by immunostaining and quantified expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Numbers of vessels were significantly increased in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle of animals fed ethanol-rich diets. VEGF (and its receptors) were upregulated in these organs. These effects were very rapid: highly significantly increased vascularization was seen within 2 weeks of commencing alcohol feeding. A neutralizing VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, inhibited new blood vessel formation induced by moderate doses of ethanol. Ethanol consumption increased vascularization and promoted skeletal muscle regeneration following hindlimb ischemia; these effects were prevented by bevacizumab. Finally, ethanol consumption protected myocardium following experimental ischemia/reperfusion.\nExperimental ethanol ingestion rapidly increases VEGF production, significantly increasing the capillary bed in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Moreover, the ethanol-induced increase of blood vessel density is protective against ischemic events (i.e., hindlimb ischemia and myocardium ischemia/reperfusion) and promotes skeletal muscle regeneration.", "journal": "Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["Jean-PierreLouboutin", "ElenaMarusich", "EhreGao", "LokeshAgrawal", "Walter JKoch", "David SStrayer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.alcohol.2012.02.001"}
{"title": "Transplantation of cord blood mesenchymal stem cells as spheroids enhances vascularization.", "abstract": "Despite promising results from the therapeutic use of stem cells for treating ischemic diseases, the poor survival of cells transplanted into ischemic regions is one of the major problems that undermine the efficacy of stem cell therapy. Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNCs) are an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) without disadvantages, such as the painful and invasive harvesting procedure, of MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. In the present study, we investigated whether the angiogenic efficacy of cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (CBMSCs) can be enhanced by grafting as spheroids in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. Human CBMSC (hCBMSC) spheroids were prepared by using the hanging-drop method. Mouse hindlimb ischemia was induced by excising the femoral artery and its branches. After surgery, the animals were divided into no-treatment, dissociated hCBMSC, and spheroid hCBMSC groups (n=8 per group) and received corresponding hCBMSC treatments. After surgery, the ischemic hindlimbs were monitored for 4 weeks, and then, the ischemic hindlimb muscles were harvested for histological analysis. Apoptotic signaling, angiogenesis-related signal pathways, and blood vessel formation were investigated in vitro and/or in vivo. The transplantation of hCBMSCs as spheroids into mouse ischemic hindlimbs significantly improved the survival of the transplanted cells by suppressing apoptotic signaling while activating antiapoptotic signaling. Furthermore, the transplantation of hCBMSCs as spheroids significantly increased the number of microvessels and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin-positive vessels in the ischemic limbs of mice, and attenuated limb loss and necrosis. Human CBMNC can be considered an alternative source of MSC, and spheroid-based hCBMSC delivery can be considered a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of hCBMSCs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Effects of sow nutrition during gestation on within-litter birth weight variation: a review.", "abstract": "The increasing demand for efficiency in pork production requires great specialization of all sectors involved in this activity. In this context, the development of strategies that could reduce undesirable traits related with negative effects on piglet survival and postnatal growth and development are essential for the pig industry. Currently, special attention is given to variation in birth weight, as some evidences suggest an increased within-litter birth weight variation in modern sows. This variation has been shown to be associated with preweaning mortality, variable weights at weaning and deteriorated growth performance, which results in economic losses and lower efficiency. Therefore, understanding the factors that can influence the events that occur during gestation and that have an impact on the fetal growth and development are important to achieve better efficiency and also to develop strategies that can be used to achieve increased within-litter uniformity of piglet birth weight. This study concludes that even at a given placental size, fetal growth may vary because of differences in placental vascularization and efficiency. Feeding extra feed or energy during late gestation only marginally improves birth weight, and positive effects are not consistent between different studies. The detrimental effects of protein restriction on fetal growth during early gestation may be due to altered placental and endometrial angiogenesis and growth, which leads to a reduction in placental-fetal blood flow, nutrient supply from mother to the fetuses and ultimately to fetal growth retardation. The number of studies that attempted to influence within-litter birth weight variation by means of sow nutrition during gestation is limited. Therefore, more research concerning sow nutrition during gestation associated with the provision of balanced diets to meet requirements of the sows and fetuses are still required. This knowledge may subsequently provide starting points for the design of nutritional strategies that can influence within-litter birth variation.", "journal": "Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["P H R FCampos", "B A NSilva", "J LDonzele", "R F MOliveira", "E FKnol"], "doi": "10.1017/S1751731111002242"}

The onset age distribution was found to have 1 peak at 40-49 year-old age group, no significant difference was observed in the female-to-male ratio (F/M = 1.2). Intracranial hemorrhage was the predominant disease type (75%). Positive family history was observed in 4.6% of patients. Histopathological findings were a narrowed lumen due to intimal fibrous thickening without significant inflammatory cell infiltration, and the internal elastic lamina was markedly tortuous and stratified. All 3 autopsy cases showed vacuolar degeneration in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. Immunohistochemical study showed the migration of smooth muscle cells in the thickened intima, and aberrant expression of IgG and S100A4 protein in vascular smooth muscle cells. The Complement C3 immunoreactivity was negative.\nThis study indicated that aberrant expression of IgG and S100A4 protein in intracranial vascular wall of MMD patients, which suggested that immune-related factors may be involved in the functional and morphological changes of smooth muscle cells, and finally caused the thickened intima. A possible mechanism is that deposits of IgG in the damaged internal elastic lamina may underlie the disruption of internal elastic lamina, which facilitated S100A4 positive SMCs migrated into intima through broken portions of the internal elastic lamina, resulting in lumen stenosis or occlusion, leading to compensatory small vessels proliferation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-05-05", "authors": ["RunhuaLin", "ZeyuXie", "JianfaZhang", "HongwuXu", "HangSu", "XueruiTan", "DongpingTian", "MinSu"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0036386"}

We found that loss of HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene VEGF-A accelerated tumor growth in murine model of mammary cancer. HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A loss also led to a reduction in vascular density and myeloid cell infiltration, which correlated with improved tumor perfusion.

More accurate prediction of clinical behavior requires better understanding of tumor biological factors influencing tumor progression. Biological processes like intratumoral hemorrhage, cell proliferation, microvessel density, and inflammation were analyzed in order to determine their role in vestibular schwannoma development. Tumor specimens of 67 patients surgically treated for a histologically proven unilateral vestibular schwannoma were studied. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were used to determine tumor size and to classify tumors as homogeneous, inhomogeneous, and cystic. Immunohistochemical studies evaluated cell proliferation (histone H3 and Ki-67), microvessel density (CD31), and inflammation (CD45 and CD68). Intratumoral hemorrhage was assessed by hemosiderin deposition. The expression patterns of these markers were compared with tumor size, tumor growth index, MRI appearance, patients' age, and duration of symptoms. No relation between cell proliferation and clinical signs of tumor volume increase or MRI appearance was found. Intratumoral hemosiderin, microvessel density, and inflammation were significantly positively correlated with tumor size and the tumor growth index. Cystic and inhomogeneous tumors showed significantly more hemosiderin deposition than homogeneous tumors. The microvessel density was significantly higher in tumors with a high number of CD68-positive cells. The volume increase of vestibular schwannomas is not based on cell proliferation alone.

The patient also performed mammographic examination, which showed an unknown oval radiopaque area. The findings were consistent with post-traumatic hematoma, even in relation to the anamnestic data, therefore we recommended anti-inflammatory therapy and a new check in fifteen days. The next ultrasonographic examination showed the persistence of the mass, slightly reduced in size, so we tried to achieve a more detailed diagnosis by performing MRI; however, the diagnostic doubt still remained, so we decided to perform a US-guided core-biopsy: the histological diagnosis was infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast.

However, whether Mesenchymal stem cells support or inhibit tumor growth remains unknown. Herein, we first observed that mesenchymal stem cells primed with IFN-\u03b3 selectively induced the death of tumor cell lines, but not normal cells. We further identified that IFN-\u03b3-primed mesenchymal stem cells expressed tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Tumor-suppressive effect of IFN-\u03b3-primed mesenchymal stem cells could be blocked by activity neutralization or expression reduction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells mediated apoptosis of tumor cells by activating caspase-3 in such cells, via a mechanism involving tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. However, when IFN-\u03b3-primed or non-primed mesenchymal stem cells were co-injected into nude mice along with H460 cells, tumor growth was much faster than that of the group receiving only tumor cells (p<0.01) because of the promoting vascularization effect of mesenchymal stem cells, although IFN-\u03b3-primed mesenchymal stem cells also exerted a certain degree of tumor-suppressive effect compared with non-primed cells (2.79\u00b10.9 g versus 2.03\u00b10.6 g). Collectively, our findings show that IFN-\u03b3-primed human mesenchymal stem cells could induce cancer cell apoptosis via TRAIL-mediated pathway.

Recent experiments have shown that penetrating arterioles of the grey matter are the building blocks for such units. Nevertheless, vascular territories are still poorly known, as the collection and analysis of large three-dimensional micro-vascular networks are difficult. By using an exhaustive reconstruction of the micro-vascular network in an 18 mm(3) volume of marmoset cerebral cortex, we numerically computed the blood flow in each blood vessel. We thus defined arterial and venular territories and examined their overlap. A large part of the intracortical vascular network was found to be supplied by several arteries and drained by several venules. We quantified this multiple potential to compensate for deficiencies by introducing a new robustness parameter. Robustness proved to be positively correlated with cortical depth and a systematic investigation of coupling maps indicated local patterns of overlap between neighbouring arteries and neighbouring venules. However, arterio-venular coupling did not have a spatial pattern of overlap but showed locally preferential functional coupling, especially of one artery with two venules, supporting the notion of vascular units.

{"title": "Predicting the effects of anti-angiogenic agents targeting specific VEGF isoforms.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of angiogenesis, whose effect on cancer growth and development is well characterized. Alternative splicing of VEGF leads to several different isoforms, which are differentially expressed in various tumor types and have distinct functions in tumor blood vessel formation. Many cancer therapies aim to inhibit angiogenesis by targeting VEGF and preventing intracellular signaling leading to tumor vascularization; however, the effects of targeting specific VEGF isoforms have received little attention in the clinical setting. In this work, we investigate the effects of selectively targeting a single VEGF isoform, as compared with inhibiting all isoforms. We utilize a molecular-detailed whole-body compartment model of VEGF transport and kinetics in the presence of breast tumor. The model includes two major VEGF isoforms, VEGF(121) and VEGF(165), receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and co-receptors Neuropilin-1 and Neuropilin-2. We utilize the model to predict the concentrations of free VEGF, the number of VEGF/VEGFR2 complexes (considered to be pro-angiogenic), and the receptor occupancy profiles following inhibition of VEGF using isoform-specific anti-VEGF agents. We predict that targeting VEGF(121) leads to a 54% and 84% reduction in free VEGF in tumors that secrete both VEGF isoforms or tumors that overexpress VEGF(121), respectively.

{"title": "Enhanced expression of VEGF-A in \u03b2 cells increases endothelial cell number but impairs islet morphogenesis and \u03b2 cell proliferation.", "abstract": "There is a reciprocal interaction between pancreatic islet cells and vascular endothelial cells (EC) in which EC-derived signals promote islet cell differentiation and islet development while islet cell-derived angiogenic factors promote EC recruitment and extensive islet vascularization. To examine the role of angiogenic factors in the coordinated development of islets and their associated vessels, we used a \"tet-on\" inducible system (mice expressing rat insulin promoter-reverse tetracycline activator transgene and a tet-operon-angiogenic factor transgene) to increase the \u03b2 cell production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), or angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) during islet cell differentiation and islet development. In VEGF-A overexpressing embryos, ECs began to accumulate around epithelial tubes residing in the central region of the developing pancreas (associated with endocrine cells) as early as embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and increased dramatically by E16.5. While \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells formed islet cell clusters in control embryos at E16.5, the increased EC population perturbed endocrine cell differentiation and islet cell clustering in VEGF-A overexpressing embryos. With continued overexpression of VEGF-A, \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells became scattered, remained adjacent to ductal structures, and never coalesced into islets, resulting in a reduction in \u03b2 cell proliferation and \u03b2 cell mass at postnatal day 1. A similar impact on islet morphology was observed when VEGF-A was overexpressed in \u03b2 cells during the postnatal period. In contrast, increased expression of Ang1 or Ang2 in \u03b2 cells in developing or adult islets did not alter islet differentiation, development, or morphology, but altered islet EC ultrastructure. These data indicate that (1) increased EC number does not promote, but actually impairs \u03b2 cell proliferation and islet formation; (2) the level of VEGF-A production by islet endocrine cells is critical for islet vascularization during development and postnatally; (3) angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling in endothelial cells does not have a crucial role in the development or maintenance of islet vascularization.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2012-05-02", "authors": ["QingCai", "MarcelaBrissova", "Rachel BReinert", "Fong ChengPan", "PriyankaBrahmachary", "MarieJeansson", "AlenaShostak", "AramandlaRadhika", "GregPoffenberger", "Susan EQuaggin", "W GrayJerome", "Daniel JDumont", "Alvin CPowers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.04.022"}

The aim of this study was to determine the capacity of HA-PLG composites to cotransplant MSCs and ECFCs, with the goal of accelerating vascularization and resultant bone formation. The incorporation of HA into PLG scaffolds improved the efficiency of cell seeding and ECFC survival in vitro. We observed increases in mRNA expression and secretion of potent angiogenic factors by MSCs when cultured on HA-PLG scaffolds compared to PLG controls. Upon implantation into an orthotopic calvarial defect, ECFC survival on composite scaffolds was not increased in the presence of MSCs, nor did the addition of ECFCs enhance vascularization beyond increases observed with MSCs alone. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) performed on explanted calvarial tissues after 12 weeks revealed no significant differences between treatment groups for bone volume fraction (BVF) or bone mineral density (BMD).

{"title": "Carotid plaque hemodynamics.", "abstract": "Internal carotid artery (ICA) plaques constitute one major source of retinal and cerebral brain embolism. Current guidelines recommend optimal treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and recanalization based on the degree of ICA stenosis. However, ICA plaque composition, motion, vascularization, and local hemodynamics have only received limited attention as potential and independent risk factors for plaque rupture. The European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) showed an increased risk of stroke recurrence even in moderate stenosis if the plaque surface was ulcerated in angiography. Further indicators of plaque instability and thus vulnerability were established by native or contrast-enhanced two-dimensional duplex ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Due to high soft tissue contrast, multi-contrast MRI seems to be ideally suited to identify plaque compositions that are prone to rupture, although data from large clinical trials proving the independent predictive value of plaque morphology are lacking. The role of cardiovascular risk factors for atherosclerosis of the common carotid artery is well established. Nevertheless, little is known concerning the impact of local hemodynamics on plaque development, progression, and rupture. Wall shear stress, the friction force acting on the endothelium of the vessel wall, was shown to be able to induce local atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaques in animal models. Plaque movement and deformation was limited to investigations using ultrasound in order to identify plaques at risk. Similarly, models to calculate tensile plaque stress seem to be able to identify peak mechanical stress acting on plaque surfaces that make such regions susceptible to rupture. In this review, current evidence regarding the correlation of plaque location, composition, and local hemodynamics at the carotid artery bifurcation will be presented. Moreover, the potential benefit of a future comprehensive and individual risk assessment will be discussed.", "journal": "Interventional neurology", "date": "2012-05-01", "authors": ["AndreasHarloff"], "doi": "10.1159/000338360"}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effects of a TIMP-2 fusion protein conjugated with human serum albumin (HSA/TIMP-2). Systemic administration of HSA/TIMP-2 effectively inhibited tumor growth at a minimum effective dose of 60 mg/kg. The suppressive effect of HSA/TIMP-2 was accompanied by a marked reduction of in vivo vascularization. The anti-angiogenic activity of HSA/TIMP-2 was directly confirmed by CAM assays. In HSA/TIMP-2-treated tumor tissues, MMP-2 expression was profoundly decreased without a change in MT1-MMP expression of PECAM-1-positive cells. MMP-2 mRNA was also decreased by HSA/TIMP-2 treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Zymographic analysis showed that HSA/TIMP-2 substantially decreased extracellular pro-MMP-2 activity (94-99% reduction) and moderately decreased active MMP-2 activity (10-24% reduction), suggesting MT1-MMP-independent MMP-2 modulation. Furthermore, HSA/TIMP-2 had no effect on in vitro active MMP-2 activity and in vivo MMP-2 activity. These studies show that HSA/TIMP-2 potentiates anti-angiogenic activity by modulating MMP-2 expression, but not MMP-2 activity, to subsequently suppress tumor growth, suggesting an important role for MMP-2 expression rather than MMP-2 activity in anti-angiogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-05-01", "authors": ["Mi-SookLee", "Jae-InJung", "Seung-HaeKwon", "Sang-MokLee", "KyojiMorita", "SongHer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035710"}
{"title": "Pattern and density of vascularization in mammalian testes, ovaries, and ovotestes.", "abstract": "According to the classical paradigm, the vasculature of the embryonic testis is more dense and complex than that of the ovary, but recent studies based on whole-mount detection of Caveolin-1 (CAV1) as an endothelial cell marker, have suggested that the level of ovarian vascularization is higher than previously assumed. However, this new hypothesis has been neither tested using alternative methodology nor investigated in other mammalian species. In this paper, we have studied the vascularization process in the gonads of males and females of two mammalian species, the mouse (Mus musculus) and the Iberian mole (Talpa occidentalis). Our results show that the pattern of testis vascularization is very well conserved among mammals, including both pre- and postnatal stages of development and, at least in the mole, it is conserved irrespectively of whether the testicular tissue is XY or XX. We have shown that CAV1 is present not only in endothelial cells but also in prefollicular oocytes and in an ovarian population of somatic cortical cells. These data clearly establish that: (1) according to the classical hypothesis, the degree of vascularization of the developing ovary is lower than that of the testis, (2) ovarian vascularization is also evolutionarily conserved as it occurs similarly both in moles and in mice, and (3) that the degree of vascular development of the mammalian ovary is age-dependent increasing significatively at puberty.

{"title": "Functional and mechanistic exploration of an adult neurogenesis-promoting small molecule.", "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus and is essential for memory and mood control. There is significant interest in identifying ways to promote neurogenesis and ensure maintenance of these hippocampal functions. Previous work with a synthetic small molecule, isoxazole 9 (Isx-9), highlighted its neuronal-differentiating properties in vitro. However, the ability of Isx-9 to drive neurogenesis in vivo or improve hippocampal function was unknown. Here we show that Isx-9 promotes neurogenesis in vivo, enhancing the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) neuroblasts, and the dendritic arborization of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons. Isx-9 also improves hippocampal function, enhancing memory in the Morris water maze. Notably, Isx-9 enhances neurogenesis and memory without detectable increases in cellular or animal activity or vascularization. Molecular exploration of Isx-9-induced regulation of neurogenesis (via FACS and microarray of SGZ stem and progenitor cells) suggested the involvement of the myocyte-enhancer family of proteins (Mef2). Indeed, transgenic-mediated inducible knockout of all brain-enriched Mef2 isoforms (Mef2a/c/d) specifically from neural stem cells and their progeny confirmed Mef2's requirement for Isx-9-induced increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, Isx-9 enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in vivo, and its effects are reliant on Mef2, revealing a novel cell-intrinsic molecular pathway regulating adult neurogenesis.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2012-05-01", "authors": ["DavidPetrik", "YindiJiang", "Shari GBirnbaum", "Craig MPowell", "Mi-SungKim", "JennyHsieh", "Amelia JEisch"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.11-201426"}

{"title": "Angiogenesis in neuroendocrine tumors: therapeutic applications.", "abstract": "The considerable research efforts devoted to the understanding of the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis have resulted in the development of targeted anti-angiogenic therapies and finally in their introduction in clinical practice. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are characterized by a high vascular supply and a strong expression of VEGF-A, one of the most potent pro-angiogenic factors, are an attractive indication for these new treatments. However, several lines of evidence show that the dense vascular networks associated with low-grade NETs are more likely to be a marker of differentiation than a marker of aggressiveness, as in other epithelial tumors. These observations form the basis for the so-called 'neuroendocrine paradox', according to which the most vascularized are the most differentiated and the less angiogenic NETs. This must be kept in mind when discussing the role of anti-angiogenic strategies in the treatment of NETs. Nevertheless, several targeted therapies, with direct or indirect anti-angiogenic properties, including anti-VEGF antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib) and mTOR inhibitors (everolimus), have recently proven to be of clinical benefit. In addition, some drugs already used in NET treatment, such as somatostatin analogues and interferon-\u03b1, may also have anti-angiogenic properties. The main challenges for the next future are to validate biomarkers for the selection of patients and the prediction of their response to refine the indications of anti-angiogenic targeted therapies and to overcome the mechanisms of resistance, which explain the limited duration of action of most of these treatments.", "journal": "Neuroendocrinology", "date": "2012-04-28", "authors": ["Jean-YvesScoazec"], "doi": "10.1159/000338371"}

Here, we used Flk1-deficient mouse embryos, which lack ECs, to perform a genome-wide survey for genes related to vascular development. We identified 184 genes that are highly enriched in developing ECs. The human orthologs of most of these genes were also expressed in HUVECs, and small interfering RNA knockdown experiments on 22 human orthologs showed that 6 of these genes play a role in tube formation by HUVECs. In addition, we created Arhgef15 knockout and RhoJ knockout mice by a gene-targeting method and found that Arhgef15 and RhoJ were important for neonatal retinal vascularization.

The terminal branches of the saphenous artery, together with the perforators of the posterior tibial artery and medial inferior genicular artery, form a stable and rich anastomotic network in the genus inferior medialis. Based on this anatomy, we designed a retrograde sartorius myocutaneous flap to repair wounds in the proximal and middle thirds of the lower leg.\nA sartorius myocutaneous flap with the posterior tibial (or medial inferior genicular) artery perforators as the pedicle was designed. The flap was based on a retrograde flow route: medial inferior genicular and posterior tibial artery perforators, the vascular network at the inferomedial knee, the saphenous artery, saphenous artery perforators, to the sartorius muscle. With this design, the flap can be transferred to the middle and proximal tibia. Between January 2007 and June 2010, 12 patients with middle/proximal lower-leg wounds were successfully treated with this method.\nTen of 12 myocutaneous flaps survived with primary healing of wounds. Two cases developed a small degree of distal superficial skin necrosis but with normal muscular blood supply and healed after conservative treatment.\nRetrograde sartorius myocutaneous pedicle flaps from the perforating branches of the medial inferior genicular artery or posterior tibial artery have advantages in terms of reliable blood supply, ease of operation and minimal amount of damage, and can be used to repair proximal and middle lower-leg wounds. They are especially applicable when lower-leg flaps are unavailable due to poor soft-tissue conditions following trauma or multiple operations.

In the absence of NG2, blood vessel development is negatively impacted in several pathological models. Our goal in this study was to determine the effect of NG2 ablation on the early development and function of blood vessels in mammary tumors in the mammary tumor virus-driven polyoma middle T (MMTV-PyMT) transgenic mouse, and to correlate these vascular changes with alterations in mammary tumor growth.\nThree different tumor paradigms (spontaneous tumors, transplanted tumors, and orthotopic allografts of tumor cell lines) were used to investigate the effects of NG2 ablation on breast cancer progression in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse. In addition to examining effects of NG2 ablation on mammary tumor growth, we also investigated effects on the structure and function of tumor vasculature.\nAblation of NG2 led to reduced early progression of spontaneous, transplanted, and orthotopic allograft mammary tumors. NG2 was not expressed by the mammary tumor cells themselves, but instead was found on three components of the tumor stroma. Microvascular pericytes, myeloid cells, and adipocytes were NG2-positive in both mouse and human mammary tumor stroma. The effect of NG2 on tumor progression therefore must be stromal in nature. Ablation of NG2 had several negative effects on early development of the mammary tumor vasculature. In the absence of NG2, pericyte ensheathment of endothelial cells was reduced, along with reduced pericyte maturation, reduced sprouting of endothelial cells, reduced assembly of the vascular basal lamina, and reduced tumor vessel diameter. These early deficits in vessel structure are accompanied by increased vessel leakiness, increased tumor hypoxia, and decreased tumor growth. NG2 ablation also diminishes the number of tumor-associated and TEK tyrosine kinase endothelial (Tie2) expressing macrophages in mammary tumors, providing another possible mechanism for reducing tumor vascularization and growth.\nThese results emphasize the importance of NG2 in mediating pericyte/endothelial cell communication that is required for proper vessel maturation and function.

In the present study, in silico search predicted that miR-409-3p targeted to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ANG mRNA. Overexpression of miR-409-3p in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells resulted in decreased steady-state level of ANG transcript and ANG production which were achieved through direct binding of this miRNA to the ANG 3'UTR. The suppressions of miR-409-3p to rRNA transcription, cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry could be partially restored by overexpression of ANG with a mutated binding site of miR-409-3p within the ANG 3'UTR. Ectopic expression of miR-409-3p in transplanted HT1080 cells led to the retardation of tumor growth, vascularization and lung metastasis in mouse tumor xenografts. In these xenografts tissues, the expression of miR-409-3p displayed an inverse correlation with ANG, which was also detected in human fibrosarcoma samples.

This study's aim was to establish a culture of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) to evaluate the biocompatibility of electrospun fiber mesh made of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and its copolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHB-HV) and to promote the differentiation of hASCs into the endothelial lineage. Fiber mesh was produced by blending 30% PHB with 70% PHB-HV and its physical characterization was conducted using scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM). Using electrospinning, fiber mesh was obtained with diameters ranging 300 nm to 1.3 \u00b5m. To assess the biological performance, hASCs were extracted, cultured, characterized by flow cytometry, expanded and seeded onto electrospun PHB/PHB-HV fiber mesh. Various aspects of the cells were analyzed in vitro using SEM, MTT assay and Calcein-AM staining. The in vitro evaluation demonstrated good adhesion and a normal morphology of the hASCs. After 7, 14 and 21 days of seeding hASCs onto electrospun PHB/PHB-HV fiber mesh, the cells remained viable and proliferative. Moreover, when cultured with endothelial differentiation medium (i.e., medium containing VEGF and bFGF), the hASCs expressed endothelial markers such as VE-Cadherin and the vWF factor. Therefore, the electrospun PHB/PHB-HV fiber mesh appears to be a suitable material that can be used in combination with endothelial-differentiated cells to improve vascularization in engineered bone tissues.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["AlessandraZonari", "SilvieneNovikoff", "Naira R PElecto", "Nat\u00e1lia MBreyner", "Dawidson AGomes", "AlbinoMartins", "Nuno MNeves", "Rui LReis", "Alfredo MGoes"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035422"}

One major criticism is an increased risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage because of the larger skull base defect. We evaluated our experience with vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF) reconstruction and compared the postoperative CSF leak rates between patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal (transsellar) approaches versus expanded EEA (transplanum-transtuberculum, transcribriform, transclival).\nRetrospective analysis at a tertiary care medical center.\nA retrospective review of a prospective database was performed on patients who underwent PNSF reconstruction for intraoperative high-flow CSF leaks after EEA between December 2008 and August 2011. Demographic data, repair materials, surgical approach, and incidence of postoperative CSF leaks were collected.\nThirty-seven transsellar defects (group I) were repaired with a PNSF, and 32 expanded EEA defects (19 transplanum-transtuberculum, 10 transcribriform, three transclival) (group II) were repaired with a PNSF. No postoperative CSF leaks occurred in group I. One delayed postoperative CSF leak was encountered in group II leading to a 3.1% leak rate in that group. The incidence of postoperative CSF leakage was not significantly different between the two groups (P > .05). Our overall success rate in this series using a PNSF was 98.6%.\nBased on our data, there is no significant increased risk of postoperative CSF leak between transsellar and expanded EEA defects when a PNSF is used. The potential risk of postoperative CSF leaks associated with larger defects created through expanded EEA can be minimized by multilayered closure with a PNSF and meticulous surgical technique.", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["Jean AndersonEloy", "Osamah JChoudhry", "Pratik AShukla", "Arjuna BKuperan", "Mark EFriedel", "James KLiu"], "doi": "10.1002/lary.23285"}

The contrast agent SonoVue was injected into a cubital vein. The intensity-time curve gradients (ITGs) were calculated from CE-US data.\nThe ITGs derived from CE-US measurements revealed higher perfusion in the affected submandibular gland compared to the contralateral side. In parallel to clinical complaints, parametric CE-US data were significantly reduced after ESWL in chronic sialolithiasis-associated sialadenitis.\nCE-US-derived ITGs appear to be an independent and quantitative marker for treatment effects of ESWL.

Local hypoxia develops and may result in altered adipokine expression, proinflammatory macrophage recruitment, and insulin resistance. We investigated whether an increase in adipose tissue angiogenesis could protect against obesity-induced hypoxia and, consequently, insulin resistance. Transgenic mice overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) were generated. Vessel formation, metabolism, and inflammation were studied in VEGF transgenic mice and wild-type littermates fed chow or a high-fat diet. Overexpression of VEGF resulted in increased blood vessel number and size in both WAT and BAT and protection against high-fat diet-induced hypoxia and obesity, with no differences in food intake. This was associated with increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Moreover, whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved. Transgenic mice presented increased macrophage infiltration, with a higher number of M2 anti-inflammatory and fewer M1 proinflammatory macrophages than wild-type littermates, thus maintaining an anti-inflammatory milieu that could avoid insulin resistance. These studies suggest that overexpression of VEGF in adipose tissue is a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of obesity and insulin resistance.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["IvetElias", "SylvieFranckhauser", "TuraFerr\u00e9", "LaiaVil\u00e0", "SabrinaTafuro", "SergioMu\u00f1oz", "CarlesRoca", "DavidRamos", "AnnaPujol", "EfrenRiu", "Jes\u00fasRuberte", "FatimaBosch"], "doi": "10.2337/db11-0832"}

In accordance to the results obtained with BCG, whose mechanism depends on the induction of the T helper 1 (TH1) immune response, we investigated the activity of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand, named Helicobacter Pylori Neutrophil Activating Protein (HP-NAP), that we recently demonstrated being able of enhancing the differentiation of Th1 cells, both in vitro and in vivo, because of its ability to create an IL-12 enriched milieu.\nWe show here, in a mouse model of bladder neoplasm implants, that local administration of HP-NAP decreases tumor growth by inducing tumor necrosis.\nThe result is joined up with a massive cluster of both CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells, within neoplasm and regional lymph nodes. It is of note that HP-NAP-treated tumors show also a reduced vascularization due to the anti-angiogenic activity of IFN-\u03b3 induced by HP-NAP.\nThe present study suggests that the activity of HP-NAP against urothelial tumor burden warrants subsequent in vivo studies.", "journal": "Urologia", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["DanieleD'Agostino", "MarcoRacioppi", "AlessioFilianoti", "LucaDi Gianfrancesco", "GaiaCodolo", "MatteoFassan", "FabioMunari", "MassimoRugge", "Mario MilcoD'Elios", "Marinade Bernard", "FrancescoPagano", "PiefrancescoBassi"], "doi": "10.5301/RU.2012.9189"}
{"title": "MEF2C ablation in endothelial cells reduces retinal vessel loss and suppresses pathologic retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy.", "abstract": "Ischemic retinopathies, including retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy, are major causes of blindness. Both have two phases, vessel loss and consequent hypoxia-driven pathologic retinal neovascularization, yet relatively little is known about the transcription factors regulating these processes. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) C, a member of the MEF2 family of transcription factors that plays an important role in multiple developmental programs, including the cardiovascular system, seems to have a significant functional role in the vasculature. We, therefore, generated endothelial cell (EC)-specific MEF2C-deficient mice and explored the role of MEF2C in retinal vascularization during normal development and in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Ablation of MEF2C did not cause appreciable defects in normal retinal vascular development. However, MEF2C ablation in ECs suppressed vessel loss in oxygen-induced retinopathy and strongly promoted vascular regrowth, consequently reducing retinal avascularity. This finding was associated with suppression of pathologic retinal angiogenesis and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction. MEF2C knockdown in cultured retinal ECs using small-interfering RNAs rescued ECs from death and stimulated tube formation under stress conditions, confirming the endothelial-autonomous and antiangiogenic roles of MEF2C. HO-1 was induced by MEF2C knockdown in vitro and may play a role in the proangiogenic effect of MEF2C knockdown on retinal EC tube formation. Thus, MEF2C may play an antiangiogenic role in retinal ECs under stress conditions, and modulation of MEF2C may prevent pathologic retinal neovascularization.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["ZhenhuaXu", "JunsongGong", "DebasishMaiti", "LinhVong", "LijuanWu", "John JSchwarz", "Elia JDuh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.02.021"}

{"title": "Neuroblast survival depends on mature vascular network formation after mouse stroke: role of endothelial and smooth muscle progenitor cell co-administration.", "abstract": "Pro-angiogenic cell-based therapies constitute an interesting and attractive approach to enhancing post-stroke neurogenesis and decreasing neurological deficit. However, most new stroke-induced neurons die during the first few weeks after ischemia, thus impairing total recovery. Although the neovascularization process involves different cell types and various growth factors, most cell therapy protocols are based on the biological effects of single-cell-type populations or on the administration of heterogeneous populations of progenitors, namely human cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells, with scarce vascular progenitor cells. Tight cooperation between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells/pericytes is critical for the development of functional neovessels. We hypothesized that neuroblast survival in stroke brain depends on mature vascular network formation. In this study, we injected a combination of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs), isolated from human umbilical cord blood, into a murine model of permanent focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The co-administration of SMPCs and EPCs induced enhanced angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in the peri-infarct and infarct areas, where vessels exhibited a more mature phenotype. This activation of vessel growth resulted in the maintenance of neurogenesis and neuroblast migration to the peri-ischemic cortex. Our data suggest that a mature vascular network is essential for neuroblast survival after cerebral ischemia, and that co-administration of EPCs and SMPCs may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the treatment of stroke.", "journal": "The European journal of neuroscience", "date": "2012-04-20", "authors": ["Lina RNih", "NicolasDeroide", "CaroleLer\u00e9-D\u00e9an", "DominiqueLerouet", "MathieuSoustrat", "Bernard ILevy", "Jean-S\u00e9bastienSilvestre", "TatianaMerkulova-Rainon", "MarcPocard", "IsabelleMargaill", "NathalieKubis"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08041.x"}

{"title": "Prohemostatic interventions in liver surgery.", "abstract": "Surgical procedures of the liver, such as partial liver resections and liver transplantation, are major types of abdominal surgery. Liver surgery can be associated with excessive intraoperative blood loss, not only because the liver is a highly vascularized organ, but also because it plays a central role in the hemostatic system. Intraoperative blood loss and transfusion of blood products have been shown to be negatively associated with postoperative outcome after liver surgery. Dysfunction of the liver is frequently accompanied with a dysfunctional hemostatic system. However, in general, there is a poor correlation between preoperative coagulation tests and the intraoperative bleeding risk in patients undergoing liver surgery. Strategies to avoid excessive blood loss in liver surgery have been an active field of research and include three different areas: surgical methods, anesthesiological methods, and pharmacological agents.Surgeons can minimize blood loss by clamping the hepatic vasculature, by using specific dissection devices, and by using topical hemostatic agents. Anesthesiologists play an important role in minimizing blood loss by avoiding intravascular fluid overload. Maintaining a low central venous pressure has shown to be very effective in reducing blood loss during partial liver resections. Prophylactic transfusion of blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has not been shown to reduce intraoperative bleeding and even seems counterproductive as it results in an increase of the intravascular filling status, which may enhance the bleeding risk. In patients with liver cirrhosis, there is increasing evidence that factors such as portal hypertension and the hyperdynamic circulation play a more important role in the bleeding tendency than changes in the coagulation system. Therefore, intravenous fluid restriction rather than prophylactic administration of large volumes of blood products (i.e., FFP) is recommended in patients undergoing major liver surgery. Pharmacological agents such as antifibrinolytic drugs or recombinant factor VIIa may be indicated in selected individual patients, but these agents do not have a routine role in the management of patients undergoing liver surgery.", "journal": "Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis", "date": "2012-04-19", "authors": ["MennoStellingwerff", "AmarinsBrandsma", "TonLisman", "Robert JPorte"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0032-1302440"}
{"title": "Fucoidan extract derived from Undaria pinnatifida inhibits angiogenesis by human umbilical vein endothelial cells.", "abstract": "In recent years, anti-angiogenic therapy has become an effective strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. Fucoidan is a class of fucose-enriched sulfated polysaccharides found in brown algae, and it is known to have strong anti-tumor property. Using a human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)-based cell culture model, the present study investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of fucoidan extracted from the brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida. Treatment of HUVECs with various concentrations of fucoidan resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, cell migration, tube formation and vascular network formation. However, significant inhibition of cell proliferation only occurred with longer treatment time (48 h instead of 24h or less). About 40% of cell proliferation and cell migration and 61% of tube formation by HUVECs were inhibited by 400 \u03bcg/ml fucoidan, the maximum concentration tested. These results appeared to suggest that modulation of angiogenesis by fucoidan might not occur through growth inhibition and apoptosis. Ex vivo angiogenesis assay demonstrated that at 100 \u03bcg/ml, fucoidan caused significant reduction in microvessel outgrowth. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses indicated that at 400 \u03bcg/ml, fucoidan significantly reduced the expression of the angiogenesis factor VEGF-A in the suppression of angiogenesis activity.

This study introduces a novel method to visualize and quantify vascularization of electrospun nanofibrous PCL/collagen scaffolds in 3D in vivo. Randomly spun PCL/collagen blend and parallel aligned PCL/collagen blend/PEO scaffolds were analyzed for numbers and patterns of sprouting vessels inside the constructs using microCT scans at different time points. The image data derived from the microCT scans was converted into three-dimensional vessel trees. The aligned scaffold showed a significantly smaller number of sprouting vessels but vascularization in the center of the constructs occurred considerably earlier than in the nonwoven scaffold. Thus, for the first time the actual pattern of vascularization in nanofibrous scaffolds can be visualized three-dimensionally. These results demonstrate that the 3D pattern of vessel trees could be an essential parameter to evaluate nanofiber scaffolds for their suitability for tissue engineering as well as in vivo applications in general.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Although the importance of \u03b2-catenin signaling during the process of endochondral bone development has been previously appreciated using a variety of genetic models that manipulate \u03b2-catenin in skeletal progenitors and osteoblasts, genetic evidence demonstrating a specific role for \u03b2-catenin in committed growth-plate chondrocytes has been less robust. To identify the specific role of cartilage-derived \u03b2-catenin in regulating cartilage and bone development, we studied chondrocyte-specific gain- and loss-of-function genetic mouse models using the tamoxifen-inducible Col2Cre(ERT2) transgene in combination with \u03b2-catenin(fx(exon3)/wt) or \u03b2-catenin(fx/fx) floxed alleles, respectively. From these genetic models and biochemical data, three significant and novel findings were uncovered. First, cartilage-specific \u03b2-catenin signaling promotes chondrocyte maturation, possibly involving a bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2)-mediated mechanism. Second, cartilage-specific \u03b2-catenin facilitates primary and secondary ossification center formation via the induction of chondrocyte hypertrophy, possibly through enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression at sites of cartilage degradation, and potentially by enhancing Indian hedgehog (IHH) signaling activity to recruit vascular tissues. Finally, cartilage-specific \u03b2-catenin signaling promotes perichondrial bone formation possibly via a mechanism in which BMP2 and IHH paracrine signals synergize to accelerate perichondrial osteoblastic differentiation.

The innovation of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and cotransplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the in vivo neovascularization activity in a critical size defect at the early phase of endochondral ossification. Cultivated human EPCs and MSCs were loaded onto \u03b2-TCP in vitro. A critical-sized bone defect (5 mm) was created surgically in the femoral diaphysis of adult athymic rat and stabilized with an external fixateur. The bone defects were filled with \u03b2-TCP, MSCs seeded on \u03b2-TCP, EPCs seeded on \u03b2-TCP, and coculture of MSCs and EPCs seeded on \u03b2-TCP or autologous bone of rat. After 1 week, the rats were sacrificed. Using quantitative CD34 immunohistochemistry as well as qualitative analysis of vascularization (staining of MHC and VEGF) in decalcified serial sections were performed by means of an image analysis system. Fluorescence microscopy analyzed the direct effects and indirect effects of human implanted EPCs for vessel formation at bone regeneration site. Formation of a primitive vascular plexus was also detectable in the \u03b2-TCP, MSC, or autologous bone group, but on a significantly higher level if EPCs alone or combined with MSCs were transplanted. Moreover, highest amount of vascularization were detected when EPCs and MSCs together were implanted. Early vascularization is improved by transplanted EPCs, which formed new vessels directly. Indeed the indirect effect of EPCs to vascularization is much higher. Transplanted EPC release chemotactic factors (VEGF) to recruit EPCs of the host and stimulate vascularization in the bone defect. Transplantation of human EPCs displays a promising approach to improve early vascularization of a scaffold in a critical bone defect.

In addition, it has been shown that some members of the \u03b2-defensin superfamily have the capacity to promote local innate inflammatory and systemic adaptive immune responses, mediated in part by the interaction with CCR6. We found that mouse \u03b2-defensin 14 (mBD14, Defb14), a newly identified member of the mouse \u03b2-defensin superfamily, is expressed in mouse fibrosarcoma tumor tissue. Tumor cells overexpressing mBD14 demonstrated enhanced solid tumor growth in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice concomitant with increased vascularization of these tumors. Furthermore, mBD14-overexpressing tumors demonstrated increased expression of proangiogenic MIP-2 (CXCL2) ex vivo. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor expression was not affected. Cellular analysis of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes revealed a significant increase of CCR6(+) B220(+) lymphocytes in solid tumors derived from mBD14-overexpressing tumor cells. Enhanced tumor growth of mBD14-overexpressing fibrosarcomas was abolished in CCR6-deficient mice, which was paralleled by decreased infiltration of CCR6(+) B220(+) lymphocytes, indicating the requirement of CCR6 expression on host cells. Previously, the interaction of activated, LT\u03b1\u03b2(+), lymphocytes with lymphotoxin \u03b2-receptor-expressing fibrosarcoma tumor cells has been identified as a new CXCL2-dependent proangiogenic pathway. Coexpression of a soluble lymphotoxin \u03b2-receptor:Ig fusion protein, an inhibitor of CXCL2-dependent angiogenesis, in mBD14-overexpressing fibrosarcoma tumor cells abolished enhanced solid tumor growth. Thus, we conclude that mBD14 expression by tumor-infiltrating host cells results in the chemoattraction of CCR6(+) B220(+) lymphocytes, which in turn initiates a proangiogenic pathway leading to enhanced angiogenesis and organized tumor tissue development.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2012-04-17", "authors": ["JohannR\u00f6hrl", "BarbaraHuber", "Gudrun EKoehl", "Edward KGeissler", "ThomasHehlgans"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.1102442"}

The coupling of myocardial and coronary vascular development is partly mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) signalling and additional unknown mechanisms. We examined the cardiomyocyte specific role of the transcriptional co-activator Cited2 on myocardial microstructure and vessel growth, in relation to Vegfa expression.\nA cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of mouse Cited2 (Cited2(Nkx)) was analysed using magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Ventricular septal defects and significant compact layer thinning (P < 0.02 at right ventricular apex, P < 0.009 at the left ventricular apex in Cited2(Nkx) vs. controls, n = 11 vs. n = 7, respectively) were found.

Impaired angiogenesis is considered a major contributing factor to these non-healing wounds. At present it is still unclear whether diabetes-associated wound healing and skin vascular dysfunction are direct consequences of impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling, or secondary due to e.g. hyperglycemia. To directly test the role of vascular endothelial insulin signaling in the development of diabetes-associated skin complications and vascular function, we inactivated the insulin receptor and its highly related receptor, the IGF-1 receptor, specifically in the endothelial compartment of postnatal mice, using the inducible Tie-2CreERT (DKO(IVE)) deleter. Impaired endothelial insulin/IGF-1 signaling did not have a significant impact on endothelial homeostasis in the skin, as judged by number of vessels, vessel basement membrane staining intensity and barrier function. In contrast, challenging the skin through wounding strongly reduced neo-angiogenesis in DKO(IVE) mice, accompanied by reduced granulation tissue formation reduced. These results show that endothelial insulin/IGF signaling is essential for neo-angiogenesis upon wounding, and imply that reduced endothelial insulin/IGF signaling directly contributes to diabetes-associated impaired healing.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2012-04-17", "authors": ["Saeed YadranjiAghdam", "Sabine AEming", "SebastianWillenborg", "BritNeuhaus", "Carien MNiessen", "LindaPartridge", "ThomasKrieg", "Jens CBruning"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.134"}

We previously reported heterogeneity for clonogenic survival when testing in vitro radiation resistance among single-cell derived clones from a human mesenchymal cancer stem cell model (hMSC). Here we aimed to determine whether this heterogeneity persisted in tumours established from these clones, and whether the response to radiation treatment was principally governed by cell-intrinsic qualities or by factors pertaining to the tumour microenvironment, such as the degree of hypoxia and vascularization.\nImmune-deficient female mice were implanted on the backs with cells from one of the clones. The subsequent tumours were subjected to either radiation treatment or had the tumour microenvironment assayed, when they reached 400 mm\u00b3. Radiation was given as a single fraction of 0-15 Gy and the degree of tumour control and time to three times the treatment volume were noted. Tumours used for the microenvironmental assay had intratumoral hypoxia measured by the Eppendorf oxygen electrode and pimonidazole staining, and the extent of vascularization determined by a microvasculature density assay using endothelial-specific staining.\nAll microenvironmental assays indicated a similar degree of hypoxia and vascularization for the selected clones. Nonetheless, the tumours responded differently to radiation treatment since the BB3 clone displayed tumour control at 5, 10 and 15 Gy, whereas tumour control was not seen below 15 Gy with the CE8 clone.\nFor tumours that displayed similar degrees of oxygenation and vascularization, the clone-specific in vitro radiation resistance could predict the in vivo response to radiation treatment.

The response of white adipocytes to hypoxia required HIF-1\u03b1, but its presence alone was incapable of inducing target gene expression under normoxic conditions. In addition to the HIF-1\u03b1 targets, hypoxia also induced many inflammatory genes. Exposure of white adipocytes to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) ligand (troglitazone) attenuated induction of these genes but enhanced expression of the HIF-1\u03b1 targets. Knockdown of PPAR\u03b3 in mature white adipocytes prevented the usual robust induction of HIF-1\u03b1 targets in response to hypoxia.

These data demonstrate that the response of white adipocytes requires HIF-1\u03b1 but also depends on PPAR\u03b3 in white cells and the PPAR\u03b3 cofactors PGC-1\u03b1 and PGC-1\u03b2 in brown cells.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-04-12", "authors": ["ElizabethPino", "HongWang", "Meghan EMcDonald", "LiQiang", "Stephen RFarmer"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.350918"}
{"title": "Reduction of tumorigenicity by placental extracts.", "abstract": "The influence of adult stem cells on tumor growth is paradoxical. On one hand, angiogenic factors secreted by stem cells are known to be essential for tumor vascularization. On the other hand, stem cell-derived factors can reportedly induce tumor differentiation or direct death of tumor cells. Both the placenta and umbilical cord are rich sources of stem cells with immune modulatory and tissue-healing properties; however, the effects of placental components on cancer cells have not been fully defined. Here we demonstrate that extracts of placental lysates reduce the malignancy of a variety of human tumor cell lines in a species-unrestricted manner. Using a standard model of leukemia cell differentiation, we demonstrated that addition of placental extracts to tumor cells, or co-culture of tumor cells with the CD34(+) cells from umbilical cord blood, induced tumor cell differentiation. Inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo was also observed following administration of placental extracts. These data support the concept of non-toxic biological therapy of cancer using stem cell derivatives, possibly through the induction of tumor cell differentiation.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2012-04-12", "authors": ["Annette MMarleau", "GregMcDonald", "JamesKoropatnick", "Chien-ShingChen", "DavidKoos"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Endothelial cell co-culture mediates maturation of human embryonic stem cell to pancreatic insulin producing cells in a directed differentiation approach.", "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have two main characteristics: they can be indefinitely propagated in vitro in an undifferentiated state and they are pluripotent, thus having the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages. Such properties make ESCs extremely attractive for cell based therapy and regenerative treatment applications. However for its full potential to be realized the cells have to be differentiated into mature and functional phenotypes, which is a daunting task. A promising approach in inducing cellular differentiation is to closely mimic the path of organogenesis in the in vitro setting. Pancreatic development is known to occur in specific stages, starting with endoderm, which can develop into several organs, including liver and pancreas. Endoderm induction can be achieved by modulation of the nodal pathway through addition of Activin A in combination with several growth factors. Definitive endoderm cells then undergo pancreatic commitment by inhibition of sonic hedgehog inhibition, which can be achieved in vitro by addition of cyclopamine. Pancreatic maturation is mediated by several parallel events including inhibition of notch signaling; aggregation of pancreatic progenitors into 3-dimentional clusters; induction of vascularization; to name a few. By far the most successful in vitro maturation of ESC derived pancreatic progenitor cells have been achieved through inhibition of notch signaling by DAPT supplementation. Although successful, this results in low yield of the mature phenotype with reduced functionality. A less studied area is the effect of endothelial cell signaling in pancreatic maturation, which is increasingly being appreciated as an important contributing factor in in-vivo pancreatic islet maturation. The current study explores such effect of endothelial cell signaling in maturation of human ESC derived pancreatic progenitor cells into insulin producing islet-like cells. We report a multi-stage directed differentiation protocol where the human ESCs are first induced towards endoderm by Activin A along with inhibition of PI3K pathway. Pancreatic specification of endoderm cells is achieved by inhibition of sonic hedgehog signaling by Cyclopamine along with retinoid induction by addition of Retinoic Acid. The final stage of maturation is induced by endothelial cell signaling achieved by a co-culture configuration. While several endothelial cells have been tested in the co-culture, herein we present our data with rat heart microvascular endothelial Cells (RHMVEC), primarily for the ease of analysis.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-04-12", "authors": ["MariaJaramillo", "IpsitaBanerjee"], "doi": "10.3791/3759"}

The Lewis rats were then reconstituted with 100 \u00d7 10(6) T-cell-depleted Brown-Norway bone marrow cells (day 0) and received vascularized Brown-Norway-CTA on day 28. Chimerism was assessed monthly by flow cytometry starting on day 28 after BMT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was assessed clinically and histologically.\nChimerism, 4 weeks after BMT, averaged 0.2%, 9.2%, 30.7%, 58%, and 99.3% in groups 1 to 5, respectively. GVHD occurred as follows: groups 1 and 2, none; group 3, 1 case of GVHD; group 4, 7 cases of GVHD (of which 3 died); and group 5, 10 cases of GVHD (of which 6 died). The percentage of long-term CTA acceptance was 0%, 0%, 90%, 70%, and 40% in groups 1 to 5, respectively. The percentage of regulatory T cells was significantly lower in high-chimerism (\u2265 20%, n = 15) than in low-chimerism (<20%, n = 5) rats that accepted CTA long-term .\nThe chimerism level correlated positively with GVHD occurrence and long-term CTA acceptance but correlated negatively with regulatory T-cell levels. Optimal chimerism for CTA acceptance through pre-CTA BMT and irradiation occurs at 20-50% at day 28 after BMT in the rat model.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2012-04-10", "authors": ["Jeng-YeeLin", "Feng-ChouTsai", "Christopher GlennWallace", "Wei-ChaoHuang", "Fu-ChanWei", "Shuen-KueiLiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2012.02.064"}

The primary study group consisted of patients with head and neck malignancies that had undergone surgical salvage with microvascular free flap reconstruction for persistent or recurrent disease following definitive radiation or concomitant chemoradiation treatment. A group of demographically matched patients who underwent microvascular free flap reconstruction for non-malignant and malignant conditions who never received radiation were randomly selected to serve as a control group. The study cohort was divided according to radiation treatment. The overall success rate of flap reconstruction was 92%, with an overall complication rate of 23%. Concurrently administered chemotherapy did not appear to affect the type of or the complication rate. The results of this investigation indicate that microvascular free flap reconstruction of head and neck defects is highly predictable, results in relatively few major complications, and suggests that neither radiation alone nor concomitant chemoradiation has a statistically significant effect on overall flap survival or complication rate.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2012-04-10", "authors": ["KArce", "R BBell", "J KPotter", "M JBuehler", "B EPotter", "E JDierks"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2012.03.004"}

Towards this aim, we report a biology-inspired concept using sulfated glycosaminoglycans to sustainably generate chemokine gradients for the localized accumulation of early endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs). StarPEG-heparin hydrogels, which have been previously demonstrated to support angiogenesis, were functionalized with SDF-1\u03b1, a potent chemoattractant known to act on EPCs. The gels were quantitatively shown to release the chemokine in amounts that are adjustable by the choice of loading concentrations and by matrix metalloprotease (MMP) mediated hydrogel cleavage. Transwell assays confirmed significantly enhanced migration of early EPCs towards concentration gradients of hydrogel-delivered SDF-1\u03b1 in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation of SDF-1\u03b1-releasing gels in mice resulted in massive infiltration of early EPCs and subsequently improved vascularization. In conclusion, sustained delivery of SDF-1\u03b1 from pro-angiogenic starPEG-heparin hydrogels can effectively attract early EPCs, offering a powerful means to trigger endogenous mechanisms of cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-04-10", "authors": ["SilvanaProkoph", "EmmanouilChavakis", "Kandice RLevental", "AndreaZieris", "UweFreudenberg", "StefanieDimmeler", "CarstenWerner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.03.039"}

More recently, this term has been used to generally indicate the growth and remodeling process of the primitive vascular network into a complex network during development. In adulthood, angiogenesis is activated as a reparative process during wound healing and following ischemia, and it plays a key role in tumor growth and metastasis as well as in inflammatory diseases and diabetic retinopathy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that negatively control gene expression of target mRNAs. In this paper, we aim at describing the role of miRNAs in postischemic angiogenesis.

{"title": "KSHV Induction of Angiogenic and Lymphangiogenic Phenotypes.", "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a highly vascularized tumor supporting large amounts of neo-angiogenesis. The major cell type in KS tumors is the spindle cell, a cell that expresses markers of lymphatic endothelium. KSHV, the etiologic agent of KS, is found in the spindle cells of all KS tumors. Considering the extreme extent of angiogenesis in KS tumors at all stages it has been proposed that KSHV directly induces angiogenesis in a paracrine fashion. In accordance with this theory, KSHV infection of endothelial cells in culture induces a number of host pathways involved in activation of angiogenesis and a number of KSHV genes themselves can induce pathways involved in angiogenesis. Spindle cells are phenotypically endothelial in nature, and therefore, activation through the induction of angiogenic and/or lymphangiogenic phenotypes by the virus may also be directly involved in spindle cell growth and tumor induction. Accordingly, KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces cell autonomous angiogenic phenotypes to activate host cells. KSHV infection can also reprogram blood endothelial cells to lymphatic endothelium. However, KSHV induces some blood endothelial specific genes upon infection of lymphatic endothelial cells creating a phenotypic intermediate between blood and lymphatic endothelium. Induction of pathways involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are likely to be critical for tumor cell growth and spread. Thus, induction of both cell autonomous and non-autonomous changes in angiogenic and lymphangiogenic pathways by KSHV likely plays a key role in the formation of KS tumors.", "journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "date": "2012-04-06", "authors": ["Terri ADimaio", "MichaelLagunoff"], "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2012.00102\n10.1182/blood-2004-09-3683\n10.1038/385347a0\n10.1038/34193\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00024-2\n10.1016/0140-6736(90)90001-L\n10.1126/science.278.5336.290\n10.1038/nm1295-1274\n10.1002/jcb.21579\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65088-2\n10.1128/JVI.02627-06\n10.1371/journal.ppat.0020116\n10.1073/pnas.0408192102\n10.1126/scisignal.259re1\n10.1016/j.virol.2004.07.008\n10.1128/JVI.00746-06\n10.1056/NEJM199505043321802\n10.1128/JVI.02723-09\n10.1128/JVI.02723-09\n10.1126/science.7997879\n10.1126/science.1074883\n10.1124/jpet.108.147686\n10.1002/ijc.26428\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002424\n10.1101/gad.8.16.1897\n10.1073/pnas.96.8.4546\n10.1038/onc.2010.411\n10.1038/376066a0\n10.1182/blood-2007-04-085555\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00217-4\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07919.x\n10.1182/blood-2011-03-341552\n10.1128/JVI.77.3.1885-1893.2003\n10.1101/gad.553410\n10.1038/ng1383\n10.1128/JVI.75.14.6402-6409.2001\n10.1073/pnas.1001065107\n10.1182/blood-2005-11-4404\n10.1128/JVI.02633-07\n10.1086/511434\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64344-1\n10.1128/JVI.00766-08\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2767\n10.1038/nmeth746\n10.1002/ijc.21969\n10.1128/JVI.01042-08\n10.1128/JVI.00016-07\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4663\n10.1136/jcp.48.11.1011\n10.1128/JVI.02052-08\n10.1128/JVI.02333-06\n10.1128/JVI.79.14.9301-9305.2005\n10.1371/journal.ppat.0030065\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.03.893\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000777\n10.1128/JVI.00231-06\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6555\n10.1128/JVI.00873-07\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.1999.00798.x\n10.1128/JVI.01889-09\n10.1038/nature07083\n10.1128/JVI.77.17.9669-9684.2003\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3321\n10.1002/ijc.2910540106\n10.1038/ng1338\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2570\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5544\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2638\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81511-1\n10.1182/blood-2011-01-330589\n10.1128/JVI.79.24.15027-15037.2005\n10.1128/JVI.01472-06\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1001046"}
{"title": "Beneficial effects of statins on endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "In recent years, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been demonstrated to play an important role during tissue vascularization and endothelium homeostasis in adults. In addition, EPCs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, such that a decreased number of EPCs may not only be a risk indicator but also a potential therapeutic target. Of the many agents that have been examined to increase EPCs and enhance their function, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are one of the most intriguing. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that statins promote EPC mobilization, proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation and reduce senescence and apoptosis independent of their serum lipid-lowering effect. This review summarizes the understanding of current mechanisms explaining the myriad of beneficial effects of statins on EPCs and discusses future challenges for studies involving statins and subpopulations of EPCs.

The hearts of donor rats were also explanted, subjected to coronary artery ligation, and grafted into the abdomen of syngeneic rats. Two wk after coronary ligation a small dish of the HYAFF(\u00ae)11/MSC construct was introduced into a pouch created in the ventricular wall of the infarct area and left for 2 wk.\nUnder ex\u00a0vivo conditions, MSCs tightly adhered to the hyaluronan fibers and secreted abundant extracellular matrix. In contrast, HYAFF(\u00ae)11 was not more surrounded by the engrafted MSCs 2 wk after construct transplantation. Most MSCs migrated near the border zone of the infarcted area close to the coronary vessels. Moreover, the infarcted region of the heart was enriched in capillaries and the degree of fibrosis was attenuated.\nTwo wk after transplantation most MSCs grafted in the infarcted myocardium with HYAFF(\u00ae)11 had left the scaffold and moved to the border zone.

CT imaging demonstrated an expansile lytic lesion of the mastoid process of the left petrous bone. MR scanning revealed a 5.2 cm \u00d7 4.7 cm \u00d7 4.2 cm mass which showed hyperintensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Histologic sections showed a papillary, cystic or glandular architecture. The papillary and glandular structures were lined by a single layer of flattened cuboidal-to-columnar cells. The stroma of the papillary fronds was richly vascularized and chronically inflamed. The tumor showed diffusely positive reactivity with cytokeratin (Pan), cytokeratin 19, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 7, EMA, vimentin, CD56, and NSE and also showed variable reactivity with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and VEGF. The Ki-67 immunostain showed a proliferation index of < 1%. Because the mass was large, it was difficult to extirpate surgically. After surgery, the patient underwent gamma-knife radiosurgery for residual tumor. The findings indicate that ELST is a rare neoplasm with benign histopathological appearance and clinically destructive behavior. Because of the rarity of this tumor, it can easily be confused with other tumors such as paraganglioma, middle ear adenoma, adenocarcinoma, papillary carcinoma of thyroid or choroid plexus papilloma.

The Deloyers procedure comprising complete mobilization and rotation of the right colon while maintaining the ileocolic artery may be used in this circumstance.\nThe aim of this study is to report postoperative and long-term outcomes after the Deloyers procedure as a salvage technique for colorectal anastomosis or coloanal anastomosis.\nFrom a prospective database, we retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent a Deloyers procedure.\nThis study was conducted at the Colorectal Unit in a tertiary referral teaching hospital.\nBetween 1998 and 2011, 48 consecutive patients underwent a Deloyers procedure. Indications were as following: Hartmann reversal (n = 17), previous colorectal anastomosis-related complications (n = 11), diverticular disease (n = 6), left colon cancer (n = 6), ischemic colitis (n = 3), iterative colectomy for cancer (n = 3), rectal cancer local recurrence (n = 1), and synchronous colon cancer (n = 1).\nThere were 38 men and 10 women (median age at surgery, 67 years). Colorectal anastomosis and coloanal anastomosis were performed in 38 and 10 patients. Thirty-one patients had defunctioning stoma. Mortality and early morbidity rate was 2% and 23%. Three patients (6%) had severe complications (Dindo \u2265 3). There was no anastomotic leakage. Reoperation was required in 2 patients for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The median hospital stay was 12 days. The median follow-up was 26 months. All patients had their ileostomy closed. Twenty-three percent of patients developed late complications.

An inflatable catheter was inserted in the posterior chamber. The balloon was inflated and its volume changed periodically at a rate of 1-2 Hz, yielding variations in the intraocular volume; thus, emulating the volume pulsations of the vascular network in the eye. The IOP was measured continuously with a pressure transducer and the OC was calculated using the outflow facility. The compliance of the balloon, mimicking the compliance of the vascular network, was estimated indirectly from the measurements of IOP, balloon pressure, and OC. The estimated balloon compliance was compared to direct estimates of balloon compliance, based on the balloon pressure-volume curve. In vivo study included 5 white New-Zealand rabbits. The method to estimate the vascular compliance of the eye was tested under normal conditions and after administration of norepinephrine, which induced a vasoconstriction leading to reduction in vascular compliance.\nIn vitro comparison of direct versus indirect estimates of compliance showed a difference that was not significant (0.075 vs. 0.077 \u03bcL/mm Hg, P = 0.86). Results from the in vivo study indicated that norepinephrine significantly increased the arterial pulse pressure amplitude, while compliance of vascular network of the eye decreased from 0.18 \u00b1 0.12 to 0.10 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcL/mm Hg (P = 0.001).\nThe eye vascular compliance can be predicted using the IOP, arterial pressure, and OC of the eyeball.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2012-04-03", "authors": ["AdanVillamarin", "SylvainRoy", "NikolaosStergiopulos"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.11-8752"}

Western Blot and immunocytochemistry were used to determine expression of STRA6 protein. Visual responses and morphological studies were performed on 6-week, 5-month and 10-month-old mice. The retinoid content of eye tissues was evaluated in dark-adapted mice by high performance liquid chromatography.\nSTRA6 protein was not detectable in stra6 -/- null mice, which had a consistent reduction, but not total ablation of their visual responses. The mice also showed significant depletion of their retinoid content in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neurosensory retina, including a 95% reduction in retinyl esters. At the morphological level, a reduction in thickness of the neurosensory retina due to shortening of the rod outer and inner segments was observed when compared to control litter mates with a commensurate reduction in rod a- and b-wave amplitudes. In addition, there was a reduction in cone photoreceptor cell number and cone b-wave amplitude. A typical hallmark in stra6 -/- null eyes was the presence of a persistent primary hypertrophic vitreous, an optically dense vascularized structure located in the vitreous humor between the posterior surface of the lens and neurosensory retina.\nOur studies of stra6 -/- null mice established the importance of the STRA6 protein for the uptake, intracellular transport, and processing of retinol by the RPE. In its absence, rod photoreceptor outer and inner segment length was reduced, and cone cell numbers were reduced, as were scotopic and photopic responses. STRA6 also was required for dissolution of the primary vitreous.

Doxorubicin was associated with PACA nanoparticles prepared by anionic emulsion polymerization (AEP) (Dox-AEP) and redox radical emulsion polymerization (RREP) (Dox-RREP). Nanoparticles and the free drug (f-Dox) were injected intravenously to rats to determine the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of doxorubicin. Curves of the pharmacokinetics showed a rapid phase of distribution followed by a slower elimination phase. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the distribution phase determined for the Dox-RREP were significantly different from those of f-Dox and Dox-AEP, while no difference was observed in the elimination phase of the three formulations. Rats treated with Dox-RREP showed lower Dox concentrations in liver but higher concentrations in heart, lungs, and kidneys compared to those treated with the other formulations. Dox-RREP exhibited a new type of stealth behavior characterized by a short circulation time and a rapid distribution in highly vascularized organs bypassing the MPS. The difference in pharmacokinetic and biodistribution observed between the drugs formulated with the two types of nanoparticles was attributed to the difference in the conformation of the dextran chains stranded on the nanoparticle surface.", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V", "date": "2012-04-03", "authors": ["KhairallahAlhareth", "ChristineVauthier", "FanchonBourasset", "ClaireGueutin", "GillesPonchel", "FathiMoussa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpb.2012.03.009"}

After tooth extraction, the sockets were augmented with Bio-Oss collagen or non-augmented. At implant placement after 4 or 12\u00a0weeks bone biopsies were obtained. Within the specimens the osteogenic and endothelial potential of mesenchymal cells was analyzed in the provisional matrix using immunohistochemical analysis with three monoclonal antibodies Cbfa1/Runx2, Osteocalcin (OC), and CD31. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, and the two-factorial analysis for repeated measurements.\nOf the 65 extraction sockets, 25 (13 non-augmented, 12 augmented) sites after 4\u00a0weeks healing time and 40 (19 non-augmented, 21 augmented) sites after 12\u00a0weeks healing time were involved in the study. No signs of acute or chronic inflammation were noted in any specimens. After 4\u00a0weeks, a median amount of 56% (10-85%) of Cbfa1 positive cells and a median amount of cells expressing OC of 21% (5-42%) were measured. A median CD31 score of 5 was observed.

In addition, markers of bone resorption are markedly increased in critically ill patients, while markers of bone formation are decreased. In the current study, we have directly investigated the effect of critical illness on bone metabolism and repair. In a human in vitro model of critical illness, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed an increase in circulating CD14+/CD11b+ osteoclast precursors in critically ill patient peripheral blood compared to healthy controls.

Culturing PBMCs with 10% critically ill patient serum further increased osteoclast formation and activity in patient PBMCs only, and neutralization studies revealed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody signaling through the immunoreceptor Fc receptor common \u03b3 chain III (FcR\u03b3III) played an important role. When analyzing bone formation, no differences in osteogenic differentiation were observed using human periosteal-derived cells (hPDCs) treated with patient serum in vitro, but a decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGF-R1) suggested impaired vascularization. This was confirmed using serum-treated hPDCs implanted onto calcium phosphate scaffolds in a murine in vivo model of bone formation, where decreased vascularization and increased osteoclast activity led to a decrease in bone formation in scaffolds with patient serum-treated hPDCs.

Continuous observation of cardiac tissue engraftment and angiogenesis could help understand these processes and allow for identification of the optimal conditions for these therapeutic interventions. We investigated the ability of a skin-fold chamber model to allow for engraftment of differentiated myocardial tissue in mice. Neonatal atrial and ventricular tissues were implanted in the in vivo chambers. All myocardial implants had a high rate of engraftment (86-95%). Tissue engraftment was preceded by a 'bleeding phase' in both the atrial and ventricular implants. This occurred earlier in ventricular compared with atrial implants. Spontaneous contractions were observed after an average of 13 days after implantation in all chambers but occurred earlier in ventricular compared with atrial implants. The host cells surrounded the myocardial implants circumferentially, but have limited infiltration into these grafts. This is the first report of successful ectopic engraftment of differentiated myocardium using a skin-fold chamber. This model is invaluable for real-time observation of early angiogenesis and tissue growth during in vivo myocardial engineering and myocardial regeneration.", "journal": "Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "date": "2012-03-30", "authors": ["Entela BLushaj", "JianHu", "RobertHaworth", "LucianLozonschi"], "doi": "10.1093/icvts/ivs093"}

Despite favorable outcomes, broad clinical application of reconstructive transplantation is limited by the potential side effects of chronic multidrug immunosuppression. Thus, any reconstructive measures to improve these non-life-threatening conditions must address a delicate balance of risks and benefits. Today, several exciting novel therapeutic strategies, such as the implementation of cellular therapies including bone marrow or stem cells that integrate the concepts of immune regulation with those of nerve regeneration, are on the horizon. The development of reliable and reproducible small and large animal models is essential for the study of the unique immunological and biological aspects of vascularized composite allografts and to translate such novel immunoregulatory and tolerance-inducing strategies and therapeutic concepts from the bench to bedside.

Because the mouse represents a superior species for vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation research, the authors developed a novel surgical technique with which to perform hemiface transplantation in mice. BALB/c hemifacial grafts were transplanted into BALB/c (group 1) or C57BL6 (group 2) recipients (n = 6 per group). Myocutaneous hemiface grafts including a vascular pedicle consisting of the common carotid artery and the external jugular vein were retrieved using superfine microsurgical instruments. The graft was transplanted orthotopically and revascularized using the recipient common carotid artery and external jugular vein for anastomosis applying a non-suture cuff technique. After an initial learning curve, the surgical procedure was performed with a constant and high success rate (78 percent). Operating time was comparable in all groups and lasted 120 \u00b1 15 minutes for the donor and 150 \u00b1 12 minutes for the recipient. All syngeneic grafts survived long term (>100 days). Allograft rejection in group 2 occurred within 14 \u00b1 2 days. Hematoxylin and eosin stains of syngeneic grafts revealed unaltered muscle and skin histology. Allogeneic grafts gradually showed distinct rejection patterns progressing with time and similar to those observed after human face transplantation.

{"title": "Vascularization in tissue engineering: angiogenesis versus inosculation.", "abstract": "The key challenge in tissue engineering is the establishment of an efficient vascularization for tissue constructs guaranteeing long-term survival and function. Vascularization may be achieved by the stimulation of angiogenesis or the inosculation of preformed microvascular networks within the implants to the host microvasculature. The present review provides an overview of these two concepts applied in tissue engineering.\nA literature search was performed in PubMed for publications focusing on vascularization, angiogenesis and inosculation in tissue engineering.\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to stimulate the ingrowth of new blood vessels into tissue constructs. These include the modification of the chemical composition and architecture of scaffolds, their bioactivation by incorporation of growth factor delivery systems or by cell seeding as well as the stimulation of stem cell recruitment. However, because angiogenesis is a time-consuming process, all of these approaches cannot prevent ischemic cell death within larger 3-dimensional tissue constructs during the initial phase after implantation. To overcome this problem, in vitro or in situ prevascularization has emerged as a novel concept in tissue engineering. This bears the advantage that preformed microvascular networks within tissue constructs simply have to inosculate with the host microvasculature at the implantation site to get completely blood-perfused within a short period of time.\nDuring the last years, considerable progress has been made in the development of promising vascularization strategies in tissue engineering. Particularly the inosculation of preformed microvascular networks has the great potential to markedly improve the survival of tissue constructs after implantation. The optimization of this vascularization strategy may pave the way for a broad clinical use of tissue engineering applications in the future.", "journal": "European surgical research.

Therefore, effective scaffold assessment techniques are required right at the initial stages of research and development so as to select or design scaffolds with suitable properties. Furthermore, since the biological performances of a scaffold is evaluated with respect to its capacity of favouring cell adhesion, proliferation as well as production of extracellular matrix, it is important to have an analytical technique able to monitor the various stages of cell culture both in vitro and especially in vivo. Finally, the development of a vascular network inside the cell scaffold construct is a fundamental requisite for achieving a full integration of the developing tissue with the host tissue. Also in this respect it is mandatory to assess the propensity of the scaffold to be permeated by blood vessels.

{"title": "Microvesicles derived from endothelial progenitor cells enhance neoangiogenesis of human pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "The efficacy of islet transplantation is limited by poor graft vascularization. We herein demonstrated that microvesicles (MVs) released from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) enhanced human islet vascularization. After incorporation into islet endothelium and \u03b2-cells, EPC-derived MVs favored insulin secretion, survival, and revascularization of islets transplanted in SCID mice. MVs induced in vitro islet endothelial cell proliferation, migration, resistance to apoptosis, and organization in vessel-like structures. Moreover, MVs partially overcame the antiangiogenic effect of rapamycin and inhibited endothelial-leukocyte interaction via L-selectin and CD40. MVs were previously shown to contain defined patterns of mRNAs. Here we demonstrated that MVs carried the proangiogenic miR-126 and miR-296 microRNAs (miRNAs). MVs pretreated with RNase or derived from Dicer knocked-down EPCs showed a reduced angiogenic effect. In addition, MVs overcame the antiangiogenic effect of the specific antagomiRs of miR-126 and miR-296, suggesting a relevant contribution of miRNAs delivered by MVs to islet endothelium. Microarray analysis of MV-stimulated islet endothelium indicated the upregulation of mRNAs coding for factors involved in endothelial proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In addition, MVs induced the activation of the PI3K-Akt and eNOS signaling pathways in islet endothelium. These results suggest that MVs activate an angiogenic program in islet endothelium that may sustain revascularization and \u03b2-cell function.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2012-03-30", "authors": ["VincenzoCantaluppi", "LuigiBiancone", "FedericoFigliolini", "SilviaBeltramo", "DavideMedica", "Maria ChiaraDeregibus", "FrancescoGalimi", "RenatoRomagnoli", "MauroSalizzoni", "CiroTetta", "Giuseppe PaoloSegoloni", "GiovanniCamussi"], "doi": "10.3727/096368911X627534"}

There is, therefore, an urgent need to identify new targets and to design innovative therapeutic approaches. Among potential candidate molecules, we evaluated the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, observing promising antitumor effects of its small-molecule inhibitor saracatinib in BTC preclinical models. The presence of an active Src protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 19 surgical samples from patients with BTC. Upon saracatinib treatment, the phosphorylation of Src and of its downstream transducers was evaluated in the BTC cell lines TFK-1, EGI-1, HuH28, and TGBC1-TKB. The effect of saracatinib on proliferation and migration was analyzed in these same cell lines, and its antitumor activity was essayed in EGI-1 mouse xenografts. Saracatinib-modulated transcriptome was profiled in EGI-1 cells and in tumor samples of the xenograft model. Src was activated in about 80% of the human BTC samples. In cultured BTC cell lines, low-dose saracatinib counteracted the activation of Src and of its downstream effectors, increased the fraction of cells in G(0)-G(1) phase, and inhibited cell migration. At high concentrations (median dose from 2.26-6.99 \u03bcmol/L), saracatinib was also capable of inhibiting BTC cell proliferation. In vivo, saracatinib treatment resulted in delayed tumor growth, associated with an impaired vascular network. Here, we provide a demonstration that the targeted inhibition of Src kinase by saracatinib is of therapeutic benefit in preclinical models of BTC.

The successful incorporation of this alloplastic biomaterial depends on adequate vascularization. Here, we analyzed whether the early vascularization of porous polyethylene can be accelerated by vitalization with human chondrocytes. For this purpose, small polyethylene samples were coated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or a suspension of PRP and human chondrocytes. Uncoated polyethylene samples served as controls. Subsequently, the samples were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of CD-1 nude mice to repetitively analyze their vascularization and biocompatibility by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. PRP-chondrocyte-coated polyethylene exhibited an accelerated and improved vascularization when compared with the other two groups. This was indicated by a significantly higher functional capillary density of the microvascular network developing around the implants. Moreover, a leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction was found in a physiological range at the implantation site of all three groups, demonstrating that the vitalization with PRP and chondrocytes did not affect the good biocompatibility of the alloplastic material. Additional histological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the chondrocytes formed a bioprotective tissue layer, which prevented the accumulation of macrophages and foreign body giant cells on the polyethylene surface. These findings clearly indicate that vitalization of polyethylene with chondrocytes promotes early implant vascularization and incorporation into the host tissue and, thus, may be a promising approach that prevents postoperative complications such as implant extrusion, migration, and infection.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Retinal angiomatous proliferation in age\u2013related macular degeneration. 2001.", "abstract": "It is known that choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) may erode through the retinal pigment epithelium, infiltrate the neurosensory retina, and communicate with the retinal circulation in what has been referred to as a retinal\u2013choroidal anastomosis (RCA). This is extremely common in the end stage of disciform disease. In recent years, the reverse also seems to be possible, as angiomatous proliferation originates from the retina and extends posteriorly into the subretinal space, eventually communicating in some cases with choroidal new vessels. This form of neovascular ARMD, termed retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) in this article, can be confused with CNV.\nThe purpose of this article is 1) to review the clinical and angiographic characteristics of a series of patients with RAP and 2) to propose a theoretical sequence of events that accounts for the neovascularized process.\nIn this retrospective clinical and angiographic analysis, 143 eyes with RAP (108 patients) were reviewed and classified based on their vasogenic nature and course. Clinical biomicroscopic examination, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were used to evaluate patients.\nThe results of this series suggest that angiomatous proliferation within the retina is the first manifestation of the vasogenic process in this form of neovascular ARMD. Dilated retinal vessels and pre-, intra-, and subretinal hemorrhages and exudate evolve, surrounding the angiomatous proliferation as the process extends into the deep retina and subretinal space. One or more dilated compensatory retinal vessels perfuse and drain the neovascularization, sometimes forming a retinal\u2013retinal anastomosis. Fluorescein angiography in these patients usually revealed indistinct staining simulating occult CNV. Indocyanine green angiography was useful to make an accurate diagnosis in most cases. It revealed a focal area of intense hyperfluorescence corresponding to the neovascularization (\"hot spot\") and other characteristic findings. Based on understanding of the nature and progression of the neovascularized process, patients with RAP were classified into three vasogenic stages. Stage I involved proliferation of intraretinal capillaries originating from the deep retinal complex (intraretinal neovascularization [IRN]). Stage II was determined by growth of the retinal vessels into the subretinal space (subretinal neovascularization [SRN]). Stage III occurred when CNV could clearly be determined clinically or angiographically. A vascularized pigment epithelial detachment and RCA were inconsistent features of this stage.\nRetinal angiomatous proliferation appears to be a distinct subgroup of neovascular ARMD. It may present in one of three vasogenic stages: IRN, SRN, or CNV. Whereas ICG angiography is helpful in diagnosing RAP and in documenting the stage of the neovascularized process, it is frequently difficult to determine the precise nature and location of the new vessel formation. It is important for clinicians to recognize the vasogenic potential and the associated manifestations of this peculiar form of neovascular ARMD so that a proper diagnosis can be made, and when possible, an appropriate management administered.", "journal": "Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2012-03-28", "authors": ["Lawrence AYannuzzi", "SilvanaNegr\u00e3o", "TomohiroIida", "CynthiaCarvalho", "HannaRodriguez-Coleman", "JasonSlakter", "K BaileyFreund", "JohnSorenson", "DennisOrlock", "NatalieBorodoker"], "doi": "10.1097/iae.0b013e31823f9b3b"}
{"title": "Dichotomous effects of VEGF-A on adipose tissue dysfunction.", "abstract": "Obese fat pads are frequently undervascularized and hypoxic, leading to increased fibrosis, inflammation, and ultimately insulin resistance. We hypothesized that VEGF-A-induced stimulation of angiogenesis enables sustained and sufficient oxygen and nutrient exchange during fat mass expansion, thereby improving adipose tissue function. Using a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible adipocyte-specific VEGF-A overexpression model, we demonstrate that the local up-regulation of VEGF-A in adipocytes improves vascularization and causes a \"browning\" of white adipose tissue (AT), with massive up-regulation of UCP1 and PGC1\u03b1. This is associated with an increase in energy expenditure and resistance to high fat diet-mediated metabolic insults. Similarly, inhibition of VEGF-A-induced activation of VEGFR2 during the early phase of high fat diet-induced weight gain, causes aggravated systemic insulin resistance. However, the same VEGF-A-VEGFR2 blockade in ob/ob mice leads to a reduced body-weight gain, an improvement in insulin sensitivity, a decrease in inflammatory factors, and increased incidence of adipocyte death. The consequences of modulation of angiogenic activity are therefore context dependent. Proangiogenic activity during adipose tissue expansion is beneficial, associated with potent protective effects on metabolism, whereas antiangiogenic action in the context of preexisting adipose tissue dysfunction leads to improvements in metabolism, an effect likely mediated by the ablation of dysfunctional proinflammatory adipocytes.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2012-03-28", "authors": ["KaiSun", "IngridWernstedt Asterholm", "Christine MKusminski", "Ana CarolinaBueno", "Zhao VWang", "Jeffrey WPollard", "Rolf ABrekken", "Philipp EScherer"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1200447109"}

Moreover, oxygen-dependent turnover of HIF-1\u03b1 in these cells is controlled by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) family of proteins. Whether HIF homologues control expression of PHDs and whether PHDs control hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) turnover and/or activity under hypoxia is not known. Here, we show that in nucleus pulposus cells, hypoxia robustly induces PHD3 expression and, to a lesser extent, of PHD2 and PHD1. Reporter analysis shows that the hypoxic induction of the PHD2 promoter is HIF-1\u03b1 dependent, whereas PHD3 promoter/enhancer activity is dependent on both HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1. Lentiviral delivery of HIF-1\u03b1, ShHIF-1\u03b1, and ShHIF-1\u03b2 confirmed these observations. Noteworthy, HIF-1\u03b1 maintains basal expression of PHD1 in hypoxia at the posttranscriptional level. Finally, loss of function studies using lentiviral transduction of ShPHDs clearly shows that even at 1% O(2), PHD2 selectively degrades HIF-1\u03b1. In contrast, in hypoxia, PHD3 enhances HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional activity without affecting protein levels. To correlate these observations with disc disease, a condition characterized by tissue vascularization, we analyzed human tissues. Increased PHD1 mRNA expression but decreased PHD2 and PHD3 expression is observed in degenerate tissues. Interestingly, the hypoxic responsiveness of all the PHDs is maintained in isolated nucleus pulposus cells regardless of the disease state.

The animals were treated daily with 100 \u00b5M xanthohumol (n= 8) or vehicle (control, n= 8) via the drinking water, starting 3 days before tissue transplantations. Lesion growth, cyst formation and vascularization were subsequently analyzed by means of high-resolution ultrasound imaging (at Day 0 and then once per week for 28 days), caliper measurements, western blotting, histology and immunohistochemistry over 4 weeks.\nIn the treatment and control groups, uterine grafts developed typical endometriotic lesions with cyst-like dilated glands surrounded by a vascularized endometrial stroma. However, xanthohumol efficiently decreased the size of these lesions at Day 28, independent of their localization within the peritoneal cavity, compared with control (peritoneal: P =0.041; mesenteric: P =0.038). This was associated with a reduced level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase protein. Moreover, vascularization of xanthohumol-treated lesions was suppressed, as indicated by a significantly lower microvessel density at Day 28 when compared with vehicle-treated controls (peritoneal: P =0.026; mesenteric: P =0.004). Additional analyses revealed that treatment with xanthohumol did not affect the histomorphology, proliferation and vascularization of the uterine horns and ovaries.\nTaken together, these experimental findings suggest that xanthohumol inhibits the development of endometriotic lesions in mice without inducing serious side effects in the reproductive organs.

Twenty cases of aneurysms limited to the proximal descending thoracic aorta were treated using endovascular repair, without preoperative spinal cord artery identification. Twenty patients--seven with extensive TAA, seven with type I TAAA, two with type II TAAA, and four with type III TAAA--underwent open surgery. Before open surgery, preoperative angiography was performed to identify spinal cord vascularization; in one case, the angiography failed to identify it. The segmental artery destined to the spinal cord artery was identified as originating from outside the aneurysm in 7 patients and inside the aneurysm in 12 patients: T6 R (1), T8 L (2), T9 L (3), T10 L (3), T11 L (3), L1 L (1). During the surgery, normothermic and femorofemoral bypass was used for visceral protection. All segmental arteries identified as critical before surgery were reattached in the graft. Twenty-four months later, computed tomography scans were performed to assess the patency of the reattached segmental arteries.\nThree patients died, including one with paraplegia (T9 L). No other cases of paraplegia were reported. Computed tomography scans were performed in 10 patients.

We determined whether irregular osteotomy under image-guided navigation make joint-saving resection possible for juxta-articular osteosarcoma while adhering oncological principles.\nWe performed joint-preserving limb salvage surgeries on six patients with juxta-articular osteosarcoma of the long bone. Three lesions located in humerus, two in tibia and one in femur. Two tumors extend to and four beyond the epiphyseal line. CT and MRI data fusion images were applied for intraoperative navigation. Planned irregular osteotomy under image-guided navigation was employed for obtaining clear surgical margin while maximizing host tissue preservation.

All specimens were examined for resection margin. Patients were followed up for average of 17.5 months for evaluating of functional and oncology outcomes.\nEntire joint were preserved in three patients and part of joint were saved in another three patients. Clear surgical margin was obtained in all specimens with a minimum of 6-mm distance between tumor and osteotomy line. No patient experienced a local recurrence. One patient developed lung metastasis and had no evidence of disease at the most recent follow-up. All allografts but one healed during the study period.

In this study, we investigated the effect of predifferentiated rat adipose tissue-derived osteoblastic cells (OBs) and endothelial cells (ECs) on calvarial bone allograft healing and vascularization using an orthotopic critical-sized calvarial defect model. For this purpose, thirty-seven 8\u2009mm critical calvarial defects in Lewis rats were treated with bone allografts seeded with no cells, undifferentiated adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASC), OBs, ECs, and OBs and ECs simultaneously. After 8 weeks, the bone volume and mineral density were calculated using microcomputed tomography and the microvessel formation using immunohistochemical staining and imaging software. The amount of bone within the 8\u2009mm defect was significantly higher for the allografts treated with ECs compared with the allografts treated with OBs (p=0.05) and simultaneously with the two cell lineages (p=0.02). There were no significant differences in bone formation between the latter two groups and the control groups (allografts treated with no cells and undifferentiated ASC). There were no significant differences in bone mineral density among the groups. The amount of microvessels was significantly higher in the group treated with ECs relative to all groups (p=<\u20090.05). Our results show that the implantation of ASC-derived ECs improves the vascularization of calvarial bone allografts at 8 weeks after treatment. This cell-based vascularization strategy can be used to improve the paucity of perfusion in allogenic bone implants.

To date, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Especially the impact on tumor glucose metabolism, or tumor vascularization remains largely unclear. The understanding of mechanisms such as early changes in tumor metabolism is of clinical importance since there may be a substantial influence on choice and sequence of drug combinations. Early signals of response to cetuximab may prove useful to identify patients having a relevant clinical treatment benefit. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the predictive relevance of the relative change in (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose tumor uptake for early clinical response during short-term single agent treatment with cetuximab. Early clinical response will be routinely measured according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Accompanying research includes cytokine immune monitoring and analysis of tumor proteins and tumor genes.\nThe REMOTUX trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center early exploratory predictive study. The first (18)F-FDG PET-CT is conducted at baseline followed by the run-in phase with cetuximab at days 1 and 8. At day 14, the second (18)F-FDG PET-CT is performed. Subsequently, patients are treated according to the Folfiri-cetuximab regimen as an active and approved first-line regimen for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. At day 56, clinical response is evaluated with a CT-scan compared to the baseline analysis. Tracer uptake is assessed using standardized uptake values (SUVs). The main hypothesis to be tested in the primary analysis is whether or not the relative change in the SUV from baseline to day 14 has any predictive relevance for early clinical response determined at day 56. Patients are followed until death from any cause or until 24 months after the last patient has ended trial treatment.\nThe aim of this trial is to evaluate metabolic changes in metastatic colorectal cancer during short-term single agent treatment with cetuximab and to analyse their potential of predicting early clinical response.

To overcome the limitations from autologous grafts, a sheep model has been established recently, which is characterized by the development of an independent axial vascularization of a bioartificial construct, permitting microsurgical transplantation. To engineer independently axially vascularized bone tissue in the sheep arteriovenous (AV)-loop model, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), without and in combination with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2), were harvested and directly autotransplanted in combination with \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate-hydroxyapatite (\u03b2-TCP-HA) granules into sheep in this study. After explantation after 12\u2009weeks, histological and immunohistochemical evaluation revealed newly formed bone in both groups. An increased amount of bone area was obtained using directly autotransplanted MSCs with rhBMP-2 stimulation. Osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells were detected adjacent to the newly formed bone, revealing an active bone remodelling process. Directly autotransplanted MSCs can be found close to the \u03b2-TCP-HA granules and are contributing to bone formation. Over time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) imaging confirmed the dense vascularization arising from the AV-loop.

Tumor-bearing rats were separated into untreated or docetaxel-treated group (6 mg/kg/week). Power Doppler Index and vascular contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) reference endpoints (Peak, area under the curve (AUC), blood flow) were evaluated at the beginning (W (0)), and after 2 and 6 weeks of docetaxel treatment (W (+2) and W (+6)). An improved CEUS image analysis, taking advantage of individual pixel intensity, was developed to quantify large, medium, and small vessels of tumors. Standard immunohistochemistry validated this new methodology analyzing tumor vascular architecture. In rats, there was an enrichment of vascularization with large vessels during tumor growth indicative of a vascular adjustment to tumor size. Docetaxel stopped tumor growth, and showed a sequential effect on vascular parameters. After an initial enrichment in larger vessels (by threefold) at W (+2), docetaxel led to a diminution of vascular parameters at W (+6) (-46 % for peak, -55 % for AUC -31 % compared to W (0)) and a vascular remodeling in favor of small vessels. One of the CEUS parameters measured before chemotherapy, the so-called global contrast-enhanced pixels density, was predictive of rat tumor response to treatment (r = 0.80; p < 0.01). The method was then applied in a clinical setting to detect changes of vascular architecture during chemotherapy of human breast carcinoma. The docetaxel chemotherapy of breast carcinomas induced a similar sequential effect, with vessel enlargement after two cycles of docetaxel treatment and an antiangiogenic effect after six cycles. Such vascular remodeling was not noticed when patients were treated with 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide.

In this study, 3D scaffolds based on this polymer (PHMGCL, HMG:CL 8:92) were prepared by means of fiber deposition (melt-plotting). The biodegradation and tissue biocompatibility of PHMGCL and PCL scaffolds after subcutaneous implantation in Balb/c mice were investigated. At 4 and 12 weeks post implantation, the scaffolds were retrieved and evaluated for extent of degradation by measuring the residual weight of the scaffolds, thermal properties (DSC), and morphology (SEM) whereas the polymer was analyzed for both its composition ((1)H NMR) and molecular weight (GPC). The scaffolds with infiltrated tissues were harvested, fixed, stained and histologically analyzed. The in vitro enzymatic degradation of these scaffolds was also investigated in lipase solutions. It was shown that PHMGCL 3D-scaffolds lost more than 60% of their weight within 3 months of implantation while PCL scaffolds showed no weight loss in this time frame. The molecular weight (M(w)) of PHMGCL decreased from 46.9 kDa before implantation to 23.2 kDa after 3 months of implantation, while the molecular weight of PCL was unchanged in this period. (1)H NMR analysis showed that the degradation of PHMGCL was characterized by a loss of HMG units. In vitro enzymatic degradation showed that PHMGCL scaffolds were degraded within 50 h, while the degradation time for PCL scaffolds of similar structure was 72 h. A normal foreign body response to both scaffold types characterized by the presence of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibrosis was observed with a more rapid onset in PHMGCL scaffolds.

The advent of either embryonic or mesenchymal adult stem-cell technology has fostered many of the efforts to combine this promising tool with TE approaches and has merged the field into the term Regenerative Medicine. As a typical example in translational medicine, the discovery of a new type of cells called Telocytes that have been described in many organs and have been detected by electron microscopy opens another gate to RM. Besides cell-therapy strategies, the application of gene therapy combined with TE has been investigated to generate tissues and organs. The vascularization of constructs plays a crucial role besides the matrix and cell substitutes. Therefore, novel in vivo models of vascularization have evolved allowing axial vascularization with subsequent transplantation of constructs.

This is largely due to the inability to visualize hemodynamics in vivo longitudinally. Therefore, we have developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20 h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8\u00b112.8 s(-1)), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation. We conclude that wide-field and microscopic functional imaging can dynamically assess blood flow and oxygenation in vivo in prevascularized tissues, and can be used to rapidly evaluate and improve prevascularization strategies.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Then, the aim of the present study is to investigate the morphological processes during angiogenesis in the CPs of healthy adult buffaloes, utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and immunogold-labeling SEM analysis (biomarkers: angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 [VEGFR-3], and CD133). At TEM, the inner surface of the blood capillaries sometimes showed pillar-like cells, which in contact with endothelial cells formed prominences, which in turn formed neo-blood capillaries. With immunogold-labeling SEM analysis, the CP blood capillaries showed Ang-2 and VEGF-3, respectively, in positive particles and spheroid formations. In addition, the external surface of the blood capillaries showed spheroid formations that originated from the neo-vascular capillaries whose terminals formed a capillary network, positive to CD133. On the basis of these results, the following hypothesis can be made, namely, that these CPs are vascular structures which play a fundamental role in maintaining brain homeostasis and self-repairing of functional vascular damage, independently of the presence of rete mirabile in this species.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2012-03-22", "authors": ["GaetanoScala", "LuciannaMaruccio"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22037"}

A total of 21 patients were analyzed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 18 months and the mean age was 46.7 years. There were 18 men and three women. The mean time from injury to flap coverage was 11.6 days. The mean size of flaps used was 15.3 \u00d7 8.2 cm. The mean size of bone defects was 2.26 cm. Segmental bone defects were observed in 5 five cases, for which bone transport or vascularized fibular graft were performed. When flaps were successful and the fracture sites did not have any evidence of infection, internal fixation with plates and bone grafting were performed. Flaps survived in 20 cases. In the 20 cases with successful flaps, two cases developed osteomyelitis, but the 20 cases achieved solid bone union at a mean of 8.6 months after the injury, salvaging the lower extremity in 100% of the cases. At the last follow-up, 9 nine cases were measured excellent or good; 6, fair; and 6, poor in the functional assessment based on the method developed by Puno et al. ALT- free flaps to cover soft tissue defects in Gustilo type IIIB open tibial fractures are considered as useful option for the treatment of composite defects. In addition, conversion to internal fixation and bone grafting can be an alternative method in order to reduce the risk of complications and inconvenience of external fixators.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2012-03-22", "authors": ["Jae HoonLee", "Duke WhanChung", "Chung SooHan"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.21970"}

Mast cells are abundant in these compartments and have been implicated in remodeling during wound healing and cancer progression. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mast cell abundance correlates with physiologic mammary tissue remodeling during estrous cycling, lactogenesis (pregnancy and lactation) and involution.\nMast cell and capillary frequency were quantified in the stroma surrounding ducts and lobules from mammary glands of rats. During estrous cycling, periductal mast cell numbers were unchanged, but lobule-associated mast cells significantly increased in the regressive phase of diestrus II. During lactogenesis, lobular stroma mast cells peaked early in pregnancy, at D2, followed by a significant decrease throughout lactation. Involution was associated with a rapid return in mast cell numbers, similar to diestrus II. Lobular vascularization peaked during the state of metestrus, when limited secretory differentiation occurs. Lobular angiogenesis peaked at D7 of pregnancy, regressed, and then returned to high levels during lactation and early involution, when secretory differentiation is high.\nThese results suggest mast cells are predominantly associated with regressive lobular remodeling during cycling and involution, whereas angiogenesis is predominantly associated with secretory differentiation.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2012-03-21", "authors": ["Robert ARamirez", "AmyLee", "PepperSchedin", "Joshua SRussell", "Patricia AMasso-Welch"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.23778"}

Twenty-seven rats bearing intracranial glioma (C6 or RG2) were imaged by MRI. Changes in transverse relaxations (\u0394R\u20092* and R(2)) were induced by the injection of an iron-based contrast agent and were mapped using a multi gradient-echo spin-echo sequence. Then, brain vascular network was studied ex vivo by histology. Three regions of interest were drawn in apparently normal tissue (neocortex and striatum) and in the tumor. In vivo mVD(MRI), Density(MRI), and VSI(MRI) were measured; ex vivo, mVD(histo), Density(histo), and VSI(histo) were quantified on the same animals. MRI and histology measurements differed by -15 to 26%. A positive correlation was found between MRI and histology for mVD, Density, and VSI counterparts (R(2) = 0.62, 0.50, 0.73, respectively; P < 0.001 in all cases).

{"title": "Impact of vegf on astrocytes: analysis of gap junctional intercellular communication, proliferation, and motility.", "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), cell proliferation, and cell dynamics in primary astrocytes. VEGF is known as a dimeric polypeptide that potentially binds to two receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, however many effects are mediated by VEGFR-2, for example, actin polymerization, forced cell migration, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Recently it has been shown that in case of hypoxia, ischemia or injury VEGF is upregulated to stimulate angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Besides this, VEGF reveals a potent therapeutical target for averting tumor vascularization, emerging in bevacizumab, the first humanized anti-VEGF-A antibody for treating recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme. To expand our knowledge about VEGF effects in glial cells, we cultivated rat astrocytes in medium containing VEGF for 1 and 2 days. To investigate the effects of VEGF on GJIC, we microinjected neurobiotin into a single cell and monitored dye-spreading into adjacent cells. These experiments showed that VEGF significantly enhances astrocytic GJIC compared with controls. Cell proliferation measured by BrdU-labeling also revealed a significant increase of astrocytic mitose rates subsequent to 1 day of VEGF exposure, whereas longer VEGF treatment for 2 days did not have additive effects. To study cell-dynamics of astrocytes subsequent to VEGF treatment, we additionally transfected astrocytes with LifeAct-RFP. Live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of these cells with aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed higher process movement of VEGF-treated astrocytes.

Angular deformity and shortening can occur due to growth plate destruction or tumor resection. A 11-year-old boy who had been operated twice in another center for an ABC located in the left proximal humerus presented to the author's institution with complaints of pain, deformity and shortening of the left arm. Plain radiographs revealed left proximal humerus nonunion with a large defect. Reconstruction with nonvascularized fibular autograft was applied and left upper extremity was immobilized in a velpou bandage. At the third-month follow-up, graft incorporation was observed in the distal part; however, proximal part did not show adequate healing on radiographs. Additional immobilization in a sling for 3\u00a0months was advised to the patient and his family. However, they were lost to follow-up and readmitted to the author's institution at the 12th month postoperatively. Radiographs showed failure of the fibular graft fixation and nonunion of the humerus. Autogenic bone grafts, either vascularized or nonvascularized are the best treatment method for the large defects after tumor curettage or resection. Nonvascularized grafts are technically much easier to use than vascularized grafts and provide excellent structural bone support at the recipient side.

{"title": "Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) with normal anterior pituitary gland: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 32 cases with a comprehensive review of the english literature.", "abstract": "Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) may arise from a remnant of Rathke's pouch. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed as other neuroendocrine or epithelial neoplasms which may develop in this site (olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma). Thirty-two patients with ESSPA identified in patients with normal pituitary glands (intact sella turcica) were retrospectively retrieved from the consultation files of the authors' institutions. Clinical records were reviewed with follow-up obtained. An immunohistochemical panel was performed on available material. Sixteen males and 16 females, aged 2-84\u00a0years (mean, 57.1\u00a0years), presented with chronic sinusitis, headache, obstructive symptoms, and visual field defects, although several were asymptomatic (n\u00a0=\u00a06). By definition, the tumors were centered within the sphenoid sinus and demonstrated, by imaging studies or intraoperative examination, a normal sella turcica without a concurrent pituitary adenoma. A subset of tumors showed extension into the nasal cavity (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or nasopharynx (n\u00a0=\u00a09). Mean tumor size was 3.4\u00a0cm. The majority of tumors were beneath an intact respiratory epithelium (n\u00a0=\u00a022), arranged in many different patterns (solid, packets, organoid, pseudorosette-rosette, pseudopapillary, single file, glandular, trabecular, insular). Bone involvement was frequently seen (n\u00a0=\u00a021). Secretions were present (n\u00a0=\u00a016). Necrosis was noted in 8 tumors. The tumors showed a variable cellularity, with polygonal, plasmacytoid, granular, and oncocytic tumor cells. Severe pleomorphism was uncommon (n\u00a0=\u00a05). A delicate, salt-and-pepper chromatin distribution was seen. In addition, there were intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and multinucleated tumor cells (n\u00a0=\u00a018). Mitotic figures were infrequent, with a mean of 1 per 10 HPFs and a <1% proliferation index (Ki-67). There was a vascularized to sclerotic or calcified stroma. Immunohistochemistry highlighted the endocrine nature of the tumors, with synaptophysin (97%), CD56 (91%), NSE (76%) and chromogranin (71%); while pan-cytokeratin was positive in 79%, frequently with a dot-like Golgi accentuation (50%). Reactivity with pituitary hormones included 48% reactive for 2 or more hormones (plurihormonal), and 33% reactive for a single hormone, with prolactin seen most frequently (59%); 19% of cases were non-reactive. The principle differential diagnosis includes olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma, and meningioma. All patients were treated with surgery. No patients died from disease, although one patient died with persistent disease (0.8\u00a0months). Surgery is curative in the majority of cases, although recurrence/persistence was seen in 4 patients (13.8%). In conclusion, ESSPAs are rare, affecting middle aged patients with non-specific symptoms, showing characteristic light microscopy and immunohistochemical features of their intrasellar counterparts. When encountering a tumor within the sphenoid sinus, ectopic pituitary adenoma must be considered, and pertinent imaging, clinical, and immunohistochemical evaluation undertaken to exclude tumors within the differential diagnosis.

We compare the antitumor efficacy of anti-HER2/neu pH-triggered lipid vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin to the anti-HER2/neu form of an FDA approved liposomal doxorubicin of DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles. The HER2/neu receptor is chosen due to its abundance in human breast cancers and its connection to low prognosis. On a subcutaneous murine BT474 xenograft model, superior control of tumor growth is demonstrated by targeted pH-triggered vesicles relative to targeted DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles (35% vs. 19% decrease in tumor volume after 32 days upon initiation of treatment). Superior tumor control is also confirmed on SKBR3 subcutaneous xenografts of lower HER2/neu expression. The non-targeted form of pH-triggered vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin results also in better tumor control relative to the non-targeted DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles (34% vs. 41% increase in tumor volume). Studies in BT474 multicellular spheroids suggest that the observed efficacy could be attributed to release of doxorubicin directly into the acidic tumor interstitium from pH-triggered vesicles extravasated into the tumor but not internalized by cancer cells. pH-triggered liposome carriers engineered from gel-phase bilayers that reversibly phase-separate with lowering pH, form transiently defective interfacial boundaries resulting in fast release of encapsulated doxorubicin.

Here, we exploited a biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel system immobilized with tethered YRGDS as the cell adhesion ligand and with either single (SSite) or multiple (MSite) collagenase-sensitive domains between crosslinks, to systematically study the effect of proteolytic cleavage site presentation on hydrogel degradation rate and three-dimensional (3-D) fibroblast invasion in vitro. Through the incorporation of multiple collagenase-sensitive domains between cross-links, hydrogel degradation rate was controlled and enhanced independent of alterations in compressive modulus. As compared to SSite hydrogels, MSite hydrogels resulted in increased 3-D fibroblast invasion in vitro, which occurred over a wider range of compressive moduli. Furthermore, encapsulated soluble acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), a potent mitogen during processes such as vascularization and wound healing, was incorporated into SSite and MSite PEGDA scaffolds to determine its in vitro potential on fibroblast cell invasion. Hydrogels containing soluble FGF-1 significantly enhanced 3-D fibroblast invasion in a dose-dependent manner within the different types of PEG matrices investigated over a period of 15 days. The methodology presented provides flexibility in designing PEG scaffolds with desired mechanical properties, but with increased susceptibility to proteolytically mediated degradation.

{"title": "Perlecan modulates VEGF signaling and is essential for vascularization in endochondral bone formation.", "abstract": "Perlecan (Hspg2) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed in basement membranes and cartilage. Perlecan deficiency (Hspg2(-/-)) in mice and humans causes lethal chondrodysplasia, which indicates that perlecan is essential for cartilage development. However, the function of perlecan in endochondral ossification is not clear. Here, we report the critical role of perlecan in VEGF signaling and angiogenesis in growth plate formation. The Hspg2(-/-) growth plate was significantly wider but shorter due to severely impaired endochondral bone formation. Hypertrophic chondrocytes were differentiated in Hspg2(-/-) growth plates; however, removal of the hypertrophic matrix and calcified cartilage was inhibited. Although the expression of MMP-13, CTGF, and VEGFA was significantly upregulated in Hspg2(-/-) growth plates, vascular invasion into the hypertrophic zone was impaired, which resulted in an almost complete lack of bone marrow and trabecular bone. We demonstrated that cartilage perlecan promoted activation of VEGF/VEGFR by binding to the VEGFR of endothelial cells. Expression of the perlecan transgene specific to the cartilage of Hspg2(-/-) mice rescued their perinatal lethality and growth plate abnormalities, and vascularization into the growth plate was restored, indicating that perlecan in the growth plate, not in endothelial cells, is critical in this process. These results suggest that perlecan in cartilage is required for activating VEGFR signaling of endothelial cells for vascular invasion and for osteoblast migration into the growth plate.

Recently, we demonstrated in a highly relevant preclinical mouse model for primary pancreatic cancers that the combination of cancer stem cell-targeting strategies in combination with a stroma-targeting agent, such as a hedgehog pathway inhibitor and chemotherapy, results in significantly enhanced long-term and progression-free survival. In the present study, we demonstrate mechanistically that Nodal-expressing pancreatic stellate cells are an important component of the tumor stroma for creating a paracrine niche for pancreatic cancer stem cells. Secretion of the embryonic morphogens Nodal/Activin by pancreatic stellate cells promoted in vitro sphere formation and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer stem cells in an Alk4-dependent manner. These data imply that the pancreatic cancer stem cell phenotype is promoted by paracrine Nodal/Activin signaling at the tumor-stroma interface. Therefore, targeting the tumor microenvironment is not only able to improve drug delivery but, even more importantly, destroys the cancer stem cell niche and, therefore, should be an integral part of cancer stem cell-based treatment strategies.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2012-03-17", "authors": ["EnzaLonardo", "JavierFrias-Aldeguer", "Patrick CHermann", "ChristopherHeeschen"], "doi": "10.4161/cc.19679"}

The success of tissue regeneration depends on optimal local vascularization and the successful integration of the artificial skin. The present study combines the use of autologous adipose-derived stem cells with a commercially available dermal substitute (Integra) for skin regeneration.\nAdipose-derived stem cells were isolated from the inguinal region of eight Sprague-Dawley adult rats, seeded onto a piece of dermal substitute for 48 hours, and then implanted into the same rat, followed by comparison of the evolution with a contralateral implant without adipose-derived stem cells. After 1, 2, and 3 weeks of regeneration in vivo, implants were removed for histologic evaluation.\nAdipose-derived stem cells adhere properly to the dermal matrix, and autologous tissue integration in the rat was good. The histologic evaluation showed that adipose-derived stem cells significantly increased microvascular density (7.7 \u00b1 0.6 percent versus 5.3. \u00b1 0.5 percent, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of factor VIII) and the synthesis of collagen type I (24 \u00b1 3 percent versus 16 \u00b1 2 percent, as assessed by Sirius red staining).

With the growing interest in studying synchronized BOLD fluctuations during the resting state, the extent to which the apparent synchrony is due to variations in the end-tidal pressure of CO(2) (PETCO(2)) is an important consideration. CO(2)-related fluctuations in BOLD signal may also represent a potential confound when studying task-related responses, especially if breathing depth and rate are affected by the task. While previous studies of the above issues have explored retrospective correction of BOLD fluctuations related to arterial PCO(2), here we demonstrate an alternative approach based on physiological clamping of the arterial CO(2) level to a near-constant value. We present data comparing resting-state functional connectivity within the default-mode-network (DMN), as well as task-related BOLD responses, acquired in two conditions in each subject: 1) while subject's PETCO(2) was allowed to vary spontaneously; and 2) while controlling subject's PETCO(2) within a narrow range. Strong task-related responses and areas of maximal signal correlation in the DMN were not significantly altered by suppressing fluctuations in PETCO(2). Controlling PETCO(2) did, however, improve the performance of retrospective physiological noise correction techniques, allowing detection of additional regions of task-related response and resting-state connectivity in highly vascularized regions such as occipital cortex. While these results serve to further rule out systemic physiological fluctuations as a significant source of apparent resting-state network connectivity, they also demonstrate that fluctuations in arterial CO(2) are one of the factors limiting sensitivity in task-based and resting-state fMRI, particularly in regions of high vascular density.

Herein, we explored new magnetic alginate composite scaffolds to provide means of physical stimulation to cells. Magnetite-impregnated alginate scaffolds seeded with aortic endothelial cells stimulated during the first 7 days out of a total 14 day experimental course showed significantly elevated metabolic activity during the stimulation period. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicated that magnetically stimulated cells had a lower proliferation index as compared to the non-stimulated cells. This suggests that the elevated metabolic activity could instead be related to cell migration and re-organization. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy analyses supported this observation showing that on day 14 in magnetically stimulated scaffolds without supplementation of any growth factors, cellular vessel-like (loop) structures, known as indicators of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis were formed as compared to cell sheets or aggregates observed in the non-stimulated (control) scaffolds.

When choosing which of the multiple musculofascial abdominal wall planes provides the most durable repair, there is little guidance. We hypothesized that the retro-rectus plane would reduce recurrence rates versus intraperitoneal placement due to greater surface area contact of mesh with well-vascularized tissue.\nForty-nine of the 80 patients in an ongoing, prospective, multicenter study of contaminated ventral hernia repairs (RICH study, NCT00617357) achieved fascial closure after musculofascial centralization and reinforcement with non-crosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix (Strattice\u2122, LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ) and were retrospectively analyzed. The Strattice was placed in the retro-rectus position in 23 patients and in the intraperitoneal position in 26.\nSubjects were comparable in age, obesity, prior wound infection, presence of a stoma, and infected mesh removal (p > 0.05). More smokers were present in the intraperitoneal group (p = 0.02). Retro-rectus defects were significantly wider and had larger area than the intraperitoneal repairs. At the 1-year follow-up, 44 (90%) of patients were available for review. There was no difference in wound infections, seromas, or hematomas. Recurrent hernias were identified in 10% of retro-rectus repairs and 30% of intraperitoneal repairs (p = 0.14).\nIn this retrospective analysis of a prospective multicenter study of large, contaminated ventral hernias, despite a larger hernia defect in the retro-rectus group, placement of the mesh in the retro-rectus compartment resulted in a similar recurrence rate to intraperitoneal mesh placement.

Estrogen-related receptor-gamma (ERR\u03b3) activates genes that govern metabolic and vascular features typical to oxidative myofibers. Therefore, ERR\u03b3-dependent remodeling of the myofibers may promote neoangiogenesis and restoration of blood perfusion in skeletal muscle ischemia.\nTo investigate the muscle fiber type remodeling by ERR\u03b3 and its role in the vascular recovery of ischemic muscle.\nUsing immunohistology, we show that skeletal muscle-specific transgenic overexpression of ERR\u03b3 increases the proportions of oxidative and densely vascularized type IIA and IIX myofibers and decreases glycolytic and less vascularized type IIB myofibers. This myofiber remodeling results in a higher basal blood flow in the transgenic skeletal muscle. By applying unilateral hind limb ischemia to transgenic and wild-type mice, we found accelerated revascularization (fluorescent microangiography), restoration of blood perfusion (laser Doppler flowmetry), and muscle repair (Evans blue dye exclusion) in transgenic compared to wild-type ischemic muscles. This ameliorative effect is linked to enhanced neoangiogenesis (CD31 staining and microfil perfusion) by ERR\u03b3. Using cultured muscle cells in which ERR\u03b3 is inactivated, we show that the receptor is dispensable for the classical hypoxic response of transcriptional upregulation and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A. Rather, the ameliorative effect of ERR\u03b3 is linked to the receptor-mediated increase in oxidative myofibers that inherently express and secrete high levels of angiogenic factors.\nThe ERR\u03b3 is a hypoxia-independent inducer of neoangiogenesis that can promote reparative revascularization.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2012-03-15", "authors": ["AntoniosMatsakas", "VikasYadav", "SabinaLorca", "Ronald MEvans", "Vihang ANarkar"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.266478"}

The production of IL-6, -8, VEGF and thrombospondin (TSP)-1 by N/R or I synovial cells was quantified by ELISA. SFC were cultured in the absence or in the presence of IL-1\u03b2 (1 ng/ml) and with or without CS (10, 50, 200 \u03bcg/ml). Gene expression of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and angiopoietin (ang)-1) and anti-angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI), TSP-1 and -2) were determined by real time RT-PCR. Production of VEGI and TSP-1 was also estimated by ELISA.\nImmunohistochemistry showed the increase of lymphocyte infiltration, vascular density and VEGF expression in I compared to N/R synovial biopsies. Synovial cells from I areas produced more IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF but less TSP-1 than cells isolated from N/R synovial biopsies. The expression of pro-angiogenic factors by SFC was stimulated by IL-1\u03b2. A time dependent regulation of the expression of anti-angiogenic factor genes was observed. IL-1\u03b2 stimulated the expression of anti-angiogenic factor genes but inhibited it after 24 h. CS reversed the inhibitory effect of IL-1\u03b2 on anti-angiogenic factors, VEGI and TSP-1.\nWe demonstrated that synovial biopsies from I areas expressed a pro-angiogenic phenotype. IL-1\u03b2 induced an imbalance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in SFC and CS tended to normalize this IL-1\u03b2-induced imbalance, providing a new possible mechanism of action of this drug.", "journal": "Arthritis research & therapy", "date": "2012-03-14", "authors": ["C\u00e9cileLambert", "MarianneMathy-Hartert", "Jean-EmileDubuc", "Eul\u00e0liaMontell", "JosepVerg\u00e9s", "CarineMunaut", "Agn\u00e8sNo\u00ebl", "YvesHenrotin"], "doi": "10.1186/ar3771\n10.1002/jcp.21258\n10.1002/art.11094\n10.1016/j.joca.2007.01.020\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.07.004\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81813-9\n10.1161/hq0701.093685\n10.1007/s12079-009-0060-8\n10.1161/hh2401.101909\n10.1136/ard.53.1.45\n10.1186/ar2716\n10.1186/ar407\n10.1186/ar79\n10.1002/art.1780401009\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63259-2\n10.1001/jama.283.11.1469\n10.1001/archinte.163.13.1514\n10.1185/03007990802434932\n10.1136/ard.2006.068882\n10.1016/j.ctim.2008.08.004\n10.1056/NEJMoa052771\n10.1016/S0950-3579(96)80045-8\n10.1038/nrrheum.2010.159\n10.1016/0003-2697(80)90165-7\n10.1093/rheumatology/keh344\n10.1016/j.joca.2006.10.010\n10.1002/jor.21134\n10.1136/ard.62.2.100\n10.1016/0014-4827(91)90397-D\n10.1002/jcp.1041600218\n10.1016/S1074-7613(02)00283-2\n10.1189/jlb.1107762\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2005.04.011"}

{"title": "A rapid lung de-cellularization protocol supports embryonic stem cell differentiation in vitro and following implantation.", "abstract": "Pulmonary diseases represent a large portion of neonatal and adult morbidity and mortality. Many of these have no cure, and new therapeutic approaches are desperately needed. De-cellularization of whole organs, which removes cellular elements but leaves intact important extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and three-dimensional architecture, has recently been investigated for ex vivo generation of lung tissues. As specific cell culture surfaces, including ECM composition, profoundly affect cell differentiation, this approach offers a potential means of using de-cellularized lungs to direct differentiation of embryonic and other types of stem/progenitor cells into lung phenotypes. Several different methods of whole-lung de-cellularization have been reported, but the optimal method that will best support re-cellularization and generation of lung tissues from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has not been determined. We present a 24-h approach for de-cellularizing mouse lungs utilizing a detergent-based (Triton-X100 and sodium deoxycholate) approach with maintenance of three-dimensional lung architecture and ECM protein composition. Predifferentiated murine ESCs (mESCs), with phenotypic characteristics of type II alveolar epithelial cells, were seeded into the de-cellularized lung scaffolds. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of coating the de-cellularized scaffold with either collagen or Matrigel to determine if this would enhance cell adhesion and affect mechanics of the scaffold. Finally, we subcutaneously implanted scaffolds in vivo after seeding them with mESCs that are predifferentiated to express pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SPC). The in vivo environment supported maintenance of the pro-SPC-expressing phenotype and further resulted in vascularization of the implant. We conclude that a rapid detergent-based de-cellularization approach results in a scaffold that can maintain phenotypic evidence of alveolar epithelial differentiation of ESCs and support neovascularization after in vivo implantation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

As such, plant biologists have long searched for unifying principles that can explain how matter and energy flux and organ partitioning scale with plant size. Several recent models have proposed a universal biophysical basis for numerous scaling phenomena in plants based on vascular network geometry. Here, we review statistical analyses of several large-scale plant datasets that demonstrate that a true hallmark of plant form variability is systematic covariation among traits. This covariation is constrained by allometries that combine and trade off with one another, rather than any single universal allometric scaling exponent for a trait or suite of traits. Further, we show that covariation can be successfully modeled using network approaches that allow for species-specific designs in plants and geometric approaches that constrain relationships among economic traits in leaves. Finally, we report large-scale efforts utilizing semi-automated software tools that quantify physical networks and can inform our attempts to link vascular network structure to plant form and function.

Nonselective beta blockers (NSBB) are the only drugs recommended for the treatment of portal hypertension. The aim of our study was to explore whether the combination of propranolol and sorafenib might show an additive effect reducing PP in cirrhotic rats. Groups of common bile duct-ligated cirrhotic rats (CBDL) and sham-operated control rats were treated by gavage with vehicle, propranolol (30 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), sorafenib (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), or propranolol+sorafenib. Treatment began 2 wk after the CBDL or sham operation. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed after 2 wk of treatment. In cirrhotic rats, propranolol and sorafenib produced a significant (P < 0.001) and similar reduction in PP (-19 and -15%, respectively). This was achieved through different mechanisms: whereas propranolol decreased PP by reducing portal blood flow (-35%; P = 0.03), sorafenib decreased PP without decreasing portal flow indicating decreased hepatic resistance. After propranolol+sorafenib, the fall in PP was significantly greater (-30%; P < 0.001) than with either drug alone, demonstrating an additive effect. However, the reduction in portal flow (-39%) under combined therapy was not significantly greater than after propranolol alone. Sorafenib, alone or in combination with propranolol, produced significant reduction in portal-systemic shunting (-25 and -33%, respectively), splanchnic vascularization (-37 and -41%, respectively), liver fibrosis (38%), and hepatic neovascularization (-42 and -51%, respectively). These effects were not observed after propranolol alone. In conclusion, the combination of propranolol+sorafenib causes a greater reduction in PP than either drug alone and decreases markedly the extent of portal-systemic shunting, splanchnic and hepatic neovascularization, and liver fibrosis, suggesting that this drug combination is a potentially useful strategy in the treatment of portal hypertension.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Recently an endoscopic endonasal approach in good collaboration with otolaryngologists has attracted major attention as a surgical approach for clival chordomas. We describe our experience with the endoscopic endonasal approach and provide a review of the literature.\nBetween 2008 and 2011, six operations were performed via the endoscopic endonasal approach for clivus chordomas. The mean tumor size was 35 mm in diameter. The tumor location was mainly from the upper to middle clivus. The tumor extended into the cavernous sinus in five cases and intradurally in three cases. A binostril approach was performed in four cases, while a one nostril approach was performed in two cases.\nGross total removal was achieved in three cases. The analysis of cases with incomplete resection suggested that residual tumors were observed epidurally and subdurally. The residual on the epidura was observed from the posterior clinoid to the posterior compartment of the cavernous sinus. On the other hand, the residual on the subdural was observed behind the upper part of the pituitary gland. There was no postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage using vascularized nasoseptal flaps in any of the cases.\nThe endoscopic endonasal transclival approach allows an appropriate extent of resection with acceptable complication rates in comparison with other approaches.

Despite advances in scaffold fabrication, current scaffold-based techniques are unable to support uniform, three-dimensional bone regeneration, and are limited to only the scaffold surface in vitro and in vivo. This is mainly because of inadequate scaffold pore sizes (<200\u2009\u03bcm) and accessible pore volume, and the associated limited oxygen diffusion and vascular invasion. In this study, we have adopted a method combining microsphere-sintering and porogen-leaching techniques to fabricate scaffolds with an increased accessible pore volume. Of the scaffolds developed, moderately porous poly(85 lactide-co-15 glycolide) (PLGA) microsphere scaffolds were selected as most advantageous, since they retain mechanical strength in the range of human cancellous bone and display a significantly higher accessible pore volume, which is attributed to an increased percentage of larger pores (i.e., size range 200-600\u2009\u03bcm). Unlike control scaffolds with a limited pore size and an accessible pore volume, moderately porous scaffolds displayed increased oxygen diffusion, pre-osteoblast cell infiltration, proliferation, and survival throughout the entire scaffold. Furthermore, moderately porous PLGA microsphere scaffolds displayed enhanced and homogenous mineralization in vitro. Since these newly designed moderately porous scaffolds are weight bearing, are fully osteoconductive, and have the ability to support vascularization, they may serve as effective scaffolds for large-area bone defect repair/regeneration. In addition, this study demonstrates the ability to modulate scaffold porosity and, in turn, to develop oxygen tension-controlled matrices that are effective for large-area bone regeneration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Extensive traumatic injuries can often disrupt the soft tissue content of the abdomen as well as the bony support provided by the pelvis. Reconstruction of the lower abdomen should aim to recreate dynamic stability. Five patients with extensive lower abdominal wall disruption following traumatic injuries or infection were treated using a novel flap for functional reconstruction. We devised a free neurotized osteomyocutaneous tensor fasciae latae (TFL) flap that would restore bony continuity by providing a vascularized bone graft and simultaneously maintain the integrity of the attachment of the tensor fascia latae muscle to the iliac crest, reestablishing musculofascial continuity. A branch of the superior gluteal nerve was harvested with this composite flap and coapted to an intercostal nerve for reinnervation, thereby creating a dynamic muscle in these patients. All patients underwent successful free tissue reconstruction with 100% flap survival. The lower abdominal wall and bony integrity of the pelvis were successfully reconstructed. Reinnervation has shown clinical signs of maintained dynamic stability. The innervated TFL osteomyocutaneous flap is an ideal option for lower abdominal reconstruction in patients with complex abdominoperineal defects with loss of bony integrity.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2012-03-09", "authors": ["Charbel TChalfoun", "Michael PMcConnell", "Garrett AWirth", "Kevin ABrenner", "Gregory R DEvans", "MarkKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0032-1306368"}

The tumour size, stage, echostructure and vascularization before and after RT were compared. Tumour vascularization was determined by qualitative power Doppler and by computer-assisted method.\nCompared to the histological data, ES restaging after RT was accurate in 65% of the cases for the T parameter and in 83% for the N parameter (TNM tumour classification). The histological data compared with the initial ES examination revealed downstaging in relation to the T parameter in 33% and for the N stage in 24% of the cases. The tumour structure following RT became hyperechogenic in 89% of tumours and remained hypoechogenic in 11% of tumours. Power Doppler found a reduction in tumour vascularization after RT in 61% of the tumours. The PDVI before RT was 10.7+/-5.8% and 6.3+/-4.6% after RT (\u0440<0.05). A strong correlation between the qualitative assessment of the vascularization and PDVI was found (r=0.536, p<0.001).

{"title": "Vascular endothelial-cadherin and vascular stability.", "abstract": "Vascular integrity is characterized by a tight control of permeability to cells and solutes and by resistance to blood flow. In several pathologies including tumor angiogenesis, vascular malformations, hemorrhagic stroke and others, there is the need to stabilize the vessels and prevent undesired bleeding or edema. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on the role of endothelial cell-to-cell adherens junctions in maintaining vascular integrity.\nThe identification of several components of adherens junctions in endothelial cells helped understanding of the complex role of these structures not only in maintaining cell-to-cell adhesion but also in transferring intracellular signals. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an endothelial-specific adhesion protein at adherens junctions, was found to interact with several signaling partners that induce contact inhibition of growth, decrease in permeability, tight junction organization and others. Changes in VE-cadherin levels in vivo may significantly affect vascular permeability, and induce uncontrolled growth and vascular fragility.\nIn the past years, the research on angiogenesis was mostly directed to the definition of the mechanisms able to modulate vascular growth. We now understand that in many pathological conditions we do not simply need to increase or inhibit vascularization but we also need to develop tools able to stabilize organ perfusion and to avoid hemorrhages or edema.", "journal": "Current opinion in hematology", "date": "2012-03-08", "authors": ["ElisabettaDejana", "CostanzaGiampietro"], "doi": "10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283523e1c"}

{"title": "Computer-assisted mandibular reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest bone graft.", "abstract": "The intention of mandibular reconstructive surgery is to achieve maximum possible functionality, which means the restoration of masticatory function and speech with a good esthetic result.\nWe compared five computer-assisted mandibular reconstructions with 15 conventional mandibular reconstructions performed using vascularized iliac crest bone grafts. Based on preoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) or CT data imported into the specific surgical planning software, a surgical guide was designed by rapid prototyping that helped to exactly translate the virtual surgery plan into the operation site whereby it fit uniquely to the iliac donor site. The ischemic time of the graft was measured intraoperatively and the difference between the amount of bone removed and the amount of bone required was determined. In addition, 3 months after surgery patients had to score the esthetics of their outer appearance using a visual analog scale.\nIn all patients the graft fit perfectly into the mandibular defect without major adjustments. The time for the shaping process of the transplant and the ischemic time were shorter than in the conventional grafting procedure. The virtual plan reduced the amount of bone removed to the required volume. The patients who underwent computer-assisted reconstruction had a higher degree of satisfaction with their outer appearance.\nOur clinical experience and the collected data suggest that the described method is very promising for optimizing the surgical result of mandibular reconstructions using iliac crest bone grafts and achieving an excellent esthetic outcome.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

{"title": "Autocrine VEGF-VEGFR2-Neuropilin-1 signaling promotes glioma stem-like cell viability and tumor growth.", "abstract": "Although vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is traditionally regarded as an endothelial cell protein, evidence suggests that VEGFRs may be expressed by cancer cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal cancer characterized by florid vascularization and aberrantly elevated VEGF. Antiangiogenic therapy with the humanized VEGF antibody bevacizumab reduces GBM tumor growth; however, the clinical benefits are transient and invariably followed by tumor recurrence. In this study, we show that VEGFR2 is preferentially expressed on the cell surface of the CD133(+) human glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), whose viability, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity rely, at least in part, on signaling through the VEGF-VEGFR2-Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) axis. We find that the limited impact of bevacizumab-mediated VEGF blockage may reflect ongoing autocrine signaling through VEGF-VEGFR2-NRP1, which is associated with VEGFR2-NRP1 recycling and a pool of active VEGFR2 within a cytosolic compartment of a subset of human GBM cells. Whereas bevacizumab failed to inhibit prosurvival effects of VEGFR2-mediated signaling, GSC viability under unperturbed or radiation-evoked stress conditions was attenuated by direct inhibition of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase activity and/or shRNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR2 or NRP1. We propose that direct inhibition of VEGFR2 kinase may block the highly dynamic VEGF-VEGFR2-NRP1 pathway and inspire a GBM treatment strategy to complement the currently prevalent ligand neutralization approach.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2012-03-07", "authors": ["PetraHamerlik", "Justin DLathia", "RikkeRasmussen", "QiulianWu", "JirinaBartkova", "MyungHeeLee", "PavelMoudry", "JiriBartek", "WalterFischer", "JiriLukas", "Jeremy NRich", "JiriBartek"], "doi": "10.1084/jem.20111424\n10.1182/blood-2011-01-328773\n10.1038/nature05236\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1010\n10.1038/nature03482\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4180\n10.1038/nrc2791\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.020\n10.1007/s11060-010-0488-y\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.03.065\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0260\n10.1038/nrc2403\n10.1200/JCO.2007.15.1829\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1073\n10.1038/nm0603-669\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4238\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0167\n10.1200/JCO.2008.19.8721\n10.1182/blood-2005-12-007484\n10.1038/nrc2246\n10.1007/s004320050325\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.8789\n10.1073/pnas.2036535100\n10.1054/bjoc.2001.2166\n10.4149/neo_2009_04_284\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210348\n10.1001/archneurol.2010.11\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181bc0184\n10.1021/jm901755g\n10.1038/labinvest.2008.57\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.093\n10.4161/cc.7.16.6442\n10.1200/JCO.2010.30.2729\n10.1083/jcb.200602080\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.02.018\n10.1242/jcs.02396\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.03.018\n10.1074/jbc.R900013200\n10.1186/1476-4598-5-67\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020180\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3150\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.040\n10.1126/science.1690453\n10.1097/01.nrl.0000250928.26044.47\n10.1038/nrneurol.2009.159\n10.1227/01.neu.0000316019.28421.95\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.018\n10.1038/35102167\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0895\n10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00442-0\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2004.01.022\n10.1073/pnas.0607668103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001652\n10.5483/BMBRep.2008.41.4.278\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2005.06.010\n10.1073/pnas.1016030108\n10.1002/jcb.10140\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.03.003\n10.1261/rna.2192803\n10.1038/nprot.2006.37\n10.1016/j.humpath.2009.08.021\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-444\n10.1093/annonc/mdp591\n10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2440\n10.1002/ijc.23130\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1242/jcs.01193\n10.1089/scd.2008.0338\n10.1038/sj.cr.7310126"}

This study investigates the effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Bzb) on the expression of key biochemical markers of bone metabolism and vascularised granulomatous tissues, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). In addition, the effect of Bzb on apoptosis of CD68+ cells was examined. A total of 32 female BALB/C mice were randomly divided into four groups. After implantation of calvaria bone from syngeneic littermates, titanium (Ti) particles were injected into established air pouches for all mice (excluding negative controls) to provoke inflammatory osteolysis. Subsequently, Bzb was administered at a ratio of 0, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/kg on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 post-surgery to alleviate this response. All of the air pouches were harvested 14 days after the surgical procedure and were processed for molecular and histological analysis. The results demonstrated that Ti injection elevated the expression of RANKL, OPG, VEGF, and TRAF6 at both the gene and protein levels, increased counts of infiltrated cells and thickness of air pouch membranes, and elevated the apoptosis index (AI) of CD68+ cells. Bzb treatment significantly improved Ti particle-induced implanted bone osteolysis, attenuated vascularised granulomatous tissues and elevated AI of CD68+ cells. Therefore, the proteasome pathway may represent an effective therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of aseptic loosening.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2012-03-07", "authors": ["XinMao", "XiaoyunPan", "SongZhao", "XiaochunPeng", "TaoCheng", "XianlongZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-012-9451-8"}

Thus, this molecule holds great therapeutic potential for biotechnological and biomedical approaches aiming to enhance tissue regeneration or to replace damaged tissues. According to present knowledge, Shh signaling controls the expression of several families of growth factors involved in neovascularization and vessel maturation and acts upstream of the most prominent angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor. In this context, a very interesting feature of Shh is that it controls both angiogenic activity and vessel stabilization by mural cells. In parallel, Shh seems to have a direct effect on endothelial cell tube formation and seems to trigger the differentiation process of mesenchymal stem cells toward the osteogenic lineage. In this chapter, we will therefore shortly summarize the multifaceted potential of Shh for bone repair and vascularization according to the current literature. In addition, we will show how coculture models based on outgrowth endothelial cells and primary osteoblasts can be used to reveal some of the relevant mechanisms by which Shh drives and connects bone regeneration and vascularization.", "journal": "Vitamins and hormones", "date": "2012-03-07", "authors": ["SabineFuchs", "EvaDohle", "Charles JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-394622-5.00022-5"}
{"title": "Sonic Hedgehog on microparticles and neovascularization.", "abstract": "Neovascularization represents a pivotal process consisting in the development of vascular network during embryogenesis and adult life. Postnatally, it arises mainly through angiogenesis, which has physiological and pathological roles in health and disease. Blood vessel formation results as tightly regulated multistep process which needs coordination and precise regulation of the balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), a morphogen belonging to Hedgehog (HH) family proteins, is implicated in a remarkably wide variety of process, including vessel development. Recent evidence demonstrate that, in addition to the classic factors, microvesicles (MVs), both microparticles (MPs) and exosomes, small vesicles released distinct cellular compartments, are involved in modulation of neovascularization. MPs generated from T lymphocytes undergoing both activation and apoptosis harbor at their surface SHH and play a crucial role in modulation of neovascularization. They are able to modulate the different steps implicated in angiogenesis process in vitro and to enhance postischemic neovascularization in vivo. As the consequence, we suggest that the MPs carrying SHH contribute to generation of a vascular network and may represent a new therapeutic approach to treat pathologies associated with failed angiogenesis.", "journal": "Vitamins and hormones", "date": "2012-03-07", "authors": ["RaffaellaSoleti", "Maria CarmenMartinez"], "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-394622-5.00018-3"}

Current approaches in bone tissue engineering are restricted by delayed vascularization and fail to recapitulate this stepwise differentiation toward bone tissue. Here, we use the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) to induce the in vitro organization of an endothelial capillary network in an artificial tissue. We show that endogenous Hedgehog activity regulates angiogenic genes and the formation of vascular lumens. Exogenous Shh further induces the in vitro development of the vasculature (vascular lumen formation, size, distribution). Upon implantation, the in vitro development of the vasculature improves the in vivo perfusion of the artificial tissue and is necessary to contribute to, and enhance, the formation of de novo mature bone tissue. Similar to the regenerating callus, the artificial tissue undergoes intramembranous and endochondral ossification and forms a trabecular-like bone organ including bone-marrow-like cavities.

{"title": "The role of synovitis in osteoarthritis pathogenesis.", "abstract": "Research into the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) has focused on cartilage and peri-articular bone, but there is increasing recognition that OA affects all of the joint tissues, including the synovium (SM). Under normal physiological conditions the synovial lining consists of a thin layer of cells with phenotypic features of macrophages and fibroblasts. These cells and the underlying vascularized connective tissue stroma form a complex structure that is an important source of synovial fluid (SF) components that are essential for normal cartilage and joint function. The histological changes observed in the SM in OA generally include features indicative of an inflammatory \"synovitis\"; specifically they encompass a range of abnormalities, such as synovial lining hyperplasia, infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, neoangiogenesis and fibrosis. The pattern of synovial reaction varies with disease duration and associated metabolic and structural changes in other joint tissues. Imaging modalities including magnetic resonance (MRI) and ultrasound (US) have proved useful in detecting and quantifying synovial abnormalities, but individual studies have varied in their methods of evaluation. Despite these differences, most studies have concluded that the presence of synovitis in OA is associated with more severe pain and joint dysfunction. In addition, synovitis may be predictive of faster rates of cartilage loss in certain patient populations. Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of synovitis in OA. Available evidence suggests that the inflammatory process involves engagement of Toll-like receptors and activation of the complement cascade by degradation products of extracellular matrices of cartilage and other joint tissues. The ensuing synovial reaction can lead to synthesis and release of a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines. Some of these inflammatory mediators are detected in joint tissues and SF in OA and have catabolic effects on chondrocytes. These inflammatory mediators represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions designed to reduce both symptoms and structural joint damage in OA.

Our experiments demonstrated that a peptide created as combination of fragments of tenascin X and fibrillin 1 (comb1) applied into cranial dermal wounds created in mice treated with cyclophosphamide to impair wound healing, can improve the rate of wound closure. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a novel peptide (UN3) created and modified from two naturally-occurring peptides, which are present in human platelet-rich plasma. In vitro testing of UN3 demonstrates that it causes a 50% increase in endothelial proliferation, 250% increase in angiogenic response and a tripling of epithelial cell migration in response to injury. Results of in vivo experiments where comb1 and UN3 peptides were added together to cranial wounds in cyclophosphamide-treated mice leads to improvement of wound vascularization as shown by an increase of the number of blood vessels present in the wound beds. Application of the peptides markedly promotes cellular responses to injury and essentially restores wound healing dynamics to those of normal, acute wounds in the absence of cyclophosphamide impairment.

Subsequent further examination (abdominal CT and MRT scans) confirmed the diagnosis of a highly vascularized mass about 10 cm in diameter, suspicious for FNH.

In this study, vessel-like network formation was studied using 3D collagen/fibrin (COL/FIB) matrices seeded with embedded EC and MSC and cultured for 7\u00a0days. The EC:MSC ratio was varied from 5:1, 3:2, 1:1, 2:3 and 1:5. The matrix composition was varied at COL/FIB compositions of 100/0 (pure COL), 60/40, 50/50, 40/60 and 0/100 (pure FIB). Vasculogenesis was markedly decreased in the highest EC:MSC ratio, relative to the other cell ratios. Network formation increased with increasing fibrin content in composite materials, although the 40/60 COL/FIB and pure fibrin materials exhibited the same degree of vasculogenesis. EC and MSC were co-localized in vessel-like structures after 7\u00a0days and total cell number increased by approximately 70%. Mechanical property measurements showed an inverse correlation between matrix stiffness and network formation. The effect of matrix stiffness was further investigated using gels made with varying total protein content and by crosslinking the matrix using the dialdehyde glyoxal. This systematic series of studies demonstrates that matrix composition regulates vasculogenesis in 3D protein hydrogels, and further suggests that this effect may be caused by matrix mechanical properties.

Thus, several strategies to improve vascularization are currently under clinical evaluation. In this study, stem cells derived from human sweat glands were isolated, characterized, seeded in collagen scaffolds, and engrafted in a mouse full skin defect model for dermal regeneration. Results showed that these cells exhibit high proliferation rates and express stem cell and differentiation markers. Moreover, cells responded to angiogenic environments by increasing their migration (P<0.001) and proliferation (P<0.05) capacity and forming capillary-like structures. After seeding in the scaffolds, cells distributed homogeneously, interacting directly with the scaffold, and released bioactive molecules involved in angiogenesis, immune response, and tissue remodeling. In vivo, scaffolds containing cells were used to induce dermal regeneration. Here we have found that the presence of the cells significantly improved vascularization (P<0.001). As autologous sweat gland-derived stem cells are easy to obtain, exhibit a good proliferation capacity, and improve vascularization during dermal regeneration, we suggest that the combined use of sweat gland-derived stem cells and scaffolds for dermal regeneration might improve dermal regeneration in future clinical settings.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2012-03-02", "authors": ["SandraDanner", "MathiasKremer", "Anna EmiliaPetschnik", "SabineNagel", "ZiyangZhang", "UrsulaHopfner", "Ann KReckhenrich", "CarolineWeber", "Thilo LSchenck", "TimBecker", "CharliKruse", "Hans-G\u00fcntherMachens", "Jos\u00e9 TEga\u00f1a"], "doi": "10.1038/jid.2012.31"}

In the present study, continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) was used to quantify CBF and obtain perfusion territory maps of the major cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Results show that both WKY and SHR have complementary, yet significantly asymmetric perfusion territories. Right or left dominances were observed in territories of the anterior (ACA), middle and posterior cerebral arteries, and the thalamic artery. Magnetic resonance angiography showed that some of the asymmetries were correlated with variations of the ACA. The leptomeningeal circulation perfusing the outer layers of the cortex was observed as well. Significant and permanent changes in perfusion territories were obtained after temporary occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in both SHR and WKY, regardless of their particular dominance. However, animals with right dominance presented a larger volume change of the left perfusion territory (23\u2009\u00b1\u20099%) than animals with left dominance (7\u2009\u00b1\u20095%, P\u2009<\u20090.002). The data suggest that animals with contralesional dominance primarily safeguard local CBF values with small changes in contralesional perfusion territory, while animals with ipsilesional dominance show a reversal of dominance and a substantial increase in contralesional perfusion territory.

In this study, we show that hrg(-/-) mice challenged with fibrosarcoma or pancreatic carcinoma grow larger tumors with increased metastatic properties. Compared with wild-type mice, fibrosarcomas in hrg(-/-) mice were more hypoxic, necrotic, and less perfused, indicating enhanced vessel abnormalization. HRG deficiency was associated with a suppressed antitumor immune response, with both increased infiltration of M2 marker-expressing macrophages and decreased infiltration of dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of transcript expression in tumor-associated as well as peritoneal macrophages from hrg(-/-) mice revealed an increased expression of genes associated with a proangiogenic and immunoinhibitory phenotype. In accordance, expression arrays conducted on HRG-treated peritoneal macrophages showed induction of genes involved in extracellular matrix biology and immune responsiveness. In conclusion, our findings show that macrophages are a direct target of HRG.

In this study, we hypothesized that local vascular microenvironment is a determinant of tumor response to PDT. Tumor vascularization and its basement membrane (collagen) were studied as a function of supplementation with basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) at the time of tumor cell inoculation. Effects on vascular composition with consequences to tumor hypoxia, photosensitizer uptake, and PDT response were measured. Matrigel-supplemented tumors developed more normalized vasculature, composed of smaller and more uniformly spaced blood vessels than their unsupplemented counterparts, but these changes did not affect tumor oxygenation or PDT-mediated direct cytotoxicity. However, PDT-induced vascular damage increased in Matrigel-supplemented tumors, following an affinity of the photosensitizer Photofrin for collagen-containing vascular basement membrane coupled with increased collagen content in these tumors. The more highly collagenated tumors showed more vascular congestion and ischemia after PDT, along with a higher probability of curative outcome that was collagen dependent. In the presence of photosensitizer-collagen localization, PDT effects on collagen were evidenced by a decrease in its association with vessels. Together, our findings show that photosensitizer localization to collagen increases vascular damage and improves treatment efficacy in tumors with greater collagen content.

It is apparent that the clinical outcome of classic techniques like adipose tissue transplantation is unpredictable, with graft resorption, lack of vascularization, and impaired functionality. In this prospective, the concept of tissue engineering was adopted to fabricate a combination product with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) toward the development of an adipose tissue construct. BCP, a combination of hydroxyapatite and \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate, was characterized for its physiochemical properties, and ASCs were characterized for their stemness. The cell-ceramic interactions were demonstrated in vitro, whereas adipogenesis was picturesquely depicted by Nile red-stained multilocular adipocyte-like cells. Subsequently, the three-dimensional cell-ceramic-engineered construct was implanted in the rat dorsal muscle for a period of 3 weeks to demonstrate the efficacy of the tissue construct in vivo. Interestingly, the histology of the postimplanted tissue construct revealed the distribution of chicken wire net-like fat cells within the vicinity of the construct. The efficacy of cell transplantation via the scaffold was traced using fluorescent in situ hybridization by labeling the Y chromosome.

To study the dynamic and reciprocal interactions between tumour cells and their microenvironment during these processes, we established a xenograft model by injecting tumour cells into the blood circulation of transparent zebrafish embryos. This reproducibly results in rapid simultaneous formation of a localized tumour and experimental micrometastasis, allowing time-resolved imaging of both processes at single-cell resolution within 1 week. The tumour vasculature was initiated de novo by remodelling of primitive endothelial cells into a functional network. Roles of myeloid cells in critical tumourigenesis steps such as vascularization and invasion were revealed by genetic and pharmaceutical approaches. We discovered that the physiological migration of neutrophils controlled tumour invasion by conditioning the collagen matrix and forming the metastatic niche, as detected by two-photon confocal microscopy and second harmonic generation. Administration of VEGFR inhibitors blocked tumour vascularization and a localized tumour growth but enhanced migration of neutrophils, which in turn promoted tumour invasion and formation of micrometastasis. This demonstrates the in vivo cooperation between VEGF signalling and myeloid cells in metastasis and provides a new mechanism underlying the recent findings that VEGFR targeting can promote tumour invasiveness.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["ShuningHe", "Gerda EmLamers", "Jan-Willem MBeenakker", "ChaoCui", "Veerander PsGhotra", "Erik HjDanen", "Annemarie HMeijer", "Herman PSpaink", "B EwaSnaar-Jagalska"], "doi": "10.1002/path.4013\n10.1093/annonc/mdn540\n10.2967/jnumed.109.072199\n10.1158/0008\u20135472.can-10\u20131088\n10.1158/1078\u20130432.ccr-08\u20130652\n10.1073/pnas.1014480108\n10.1158/0008\u20135472.can-09\u20133592\n10.1158/0008\u20135472.can-08\u20130925\n10.1200/jco.2006.08.9821\n10.1182/blood-2006\u201305\u2013024075\n10.1073/pnas.0703446104\n10.1242/jcs.009159\n10.1158/0008\u20135472.can-06\u20134268\n10.1158/0008\u20135472.can-05\u20133560\n10.1073/pnas.172368799\n10.1189/jlb.0506346\n10.1089/zeb.2007.0505\n10.1182/blood-2010\u201310\u2013314120\n10.1074/jbc.M706640200\n10.1182/blood-2010\u201303\u2013276972\n10.1200/jco.2008.18.9498"}

Although neoadjuvant irradiation possesses advantages over adjuvant irradiation related to smaller doses and field sizes, existing studies suggest adverse effects on wound healing and possibly microvascular free flap success. Conversely, microvascular reconstruction may counteract some of the negative effects of irradiation by replacing irradiated tissue with well-vascularized unirradiated tissue from a distant site.\nA review of sarcoma patients who underwent resection, microsurgical reconstruction, and either neoadjuvant or adjuvant irradiation was performed.\nA total of 119 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 73 underwent neoadjuvant irradiation and 46 underwent adjuvant irradiation. Sarcomas were located in the head and neck (n = 47), trunk (n = 7), upper extremity (n = 15), and lower extremity (n = 50). The rate of perioperative (\u2264 30 days) complications was 26.9 percent, whereas the rate of late recipient-site complications was 14.3 percent. No significant differences in perioperative recipient-site (p = 0.19), donor-site (p = 1.00), or medical complications (p = 0.30) were observed between patients undergoing neoadjuvant and adjuvant irradiation.

Negative feedback regulation is a critical physiological mechanism. Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) was recently discovered as a novel endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of vascularization. We therefore investigated the expression of VASH1 in the bovine CL. Expression of VASH1 mRNA and protein was predominantly localized to luteal endothelial cells (LECs). VASH1 expression in the CL was constant through the early to late luteal phases and decreased during CL regression relating with the action of luteolytic prostaglandin F(2)(\u03b1) in vivo. To investigate the role of VASH1, we determined whether VASH1 treatment affects angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis using LECs and lymphatic endothelial cells (LyECs) in vitro. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulated the expression of VASH1 in LECs but not in LyECs, and VASH1 completely blocked VEGFA-induced formation of capillary-like tube structures of LECs and LyECs in vitro. In summary, VASH1 is predominantly located on LECs in the bovine CL and inhibits the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic actions of VEGFA. Bovine CL therefore has a VEGFA-VASH1 system that may be involved in regulation of luteal function, especially in the development of the CL. The results indicate that VASH1 has the potential to act as a negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the CL in cows.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["KoumeiShirasuna", "AyumiKobayashi", "AkaneNitta", "SayoNibuno", "KiemiSasahara", "TakashiShimizu", "HeinrichBollwein", "AkioMiyamoto"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-11-0465"}

On the next day following the operation 24 rats were injected intramuscularly with bacterial melanin solution. 12 of these rats were initially trained to ICR. Recovery periods of ICR and paralyzed hindlimb movements were registered for melanin injected rats (n=24) and for operated rats, not treated with melanin (n=24). In rats injected with bacterial melanin the posttraumatic recovery is shorter than in animals not treated with melanin. The fastest and complete recovery was registered in rats initially trained to ICR and injected after the operation with bacterial melanin. Electrophysiological experiments were performed in transected animals treated with melanin, transected animals without melanin treatment and intact animals. Spiking activity of motoneurons was registered in lumbar motoneurons of rats in response to high frequency stimulation above the corticospinal tract transection. Spiking activity was very similar in motoneurons of melanin injected and intact or non operated animals. In animals, not dosed with bacterial melanin after the operation, areactivity or no change in firing rate was registered in response to stimulus. Stimulation of the corticospinal tract of melanin injected rats produced potentiation of the motoneuronal firing rate and is an evidence of regeneration in corticospinal tract. Similarity in spiking activity of intact and melanin injected rats shows the recovery of conductance in pyramidal tract.

A rat model (ENDO) involves autotransplanting on abdominal arteries uterine segments that grow into vascularized cysts that become innervated with sensory and sympathetic fibers. ENDO rats exhibit vaginal hyperalgesia. We used behavioral, physiological, and immunohistochemical methods to test the hypothesis that cyst innervation contributes to the development of this hyperalgesia after transplant. Rudimentary sensory and sympathetic innervation appeared in the cysts at two weeks, sprouted further and more densely into the cyst wall by four weeks, and matured by six weeks post-transplant. Sensory fibers became abnormally functionally active between two and three weeks post-transplant, remaining active thereafter. Vaginal hyperalgesia became significant between four and five weeks post-transplant, and stabilized after six to eight weeks. Removing cysts before they acquired functional innervation prevented vaginal hyperalgesia from developing, whereas sham cyst removal did not. Thus, abnormally-active innervation of ectopic growths occurs before hyperalgesia develops, supporting the hypothesis. These findings suggest that painful endometriosis can be classified as a mixed inflammatory/neuropathic pain condition, which opens new avenues for pain relief. The findings also have implications beyond endometriosis by suggesting that functionality of any transplanted tissue can be influenced by the innervation it acquires.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["Stacy LMcAllister", "NataliaDmitrieva", "Karen JBerkley"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0031758"}

Surgical resection and liver transplantation remain the only curative options for a small subset of patients. Few patients with HCC are diagnosed early enough to be eligible for curative treatment. Angiogenesis inhibition is a natural therapeutic target for all solid tumors, but particularly for the highly vascularized HCC tumors. With the approval of the targeted agent sorafenib, there are now additional options for patients with HCC. Although sorafenib does produce some improvement in survival in HCC patients, the responses are not durable. In addition, there are significant dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and metabolic toxicities, and, as importantly, there is still limited knowledge of its usefulness in special subpopulations with HCC. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are in development to treat HCC both in the first-line setting and for use following sorafenib failure; the furthest in development is brivanib, a dual fibroblast growth factor pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor. Additional agents with antiangiogenic properties also in phase II and III development for the treatment of patients with HCC include bevacizumab, ramucirumab, ABT-869, everolimus and ARQ 197.", "journal": "World journal of gastroenterology", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["CatherineFrenette", "RobertGish"], "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v18.i6.498"}

Grafts were monitored for rejection episodes and response to immunosuppressive therapies as previously described. Donor and recipient lymphatic channels were evaluated using a near-infrared handheld dual-channel light-emitting diode camera system capable of detecting fluorescence from indocyanine green injections. Graft lymphatic channels were serially evaluated from postoperative day 0 to 364.\nPreoperative imaging demonstrated superficial lymphatic anatomy similar to human anatomy. Initial resolution of facial allograft swelling coincided with superficial donor-recipient lymphatic channel reconstitution.

However, lymphatic channels demonstrated persistent functional and anatomic pathology, and graft edema never fully resolved. No differences in lymphatic channels were noted between grafts that developed transplant vasculopathy (n = 3) and those that did not (n = 6).

Technical causes of graft edema may be overcome with alternative surgical techniques, allowing for direct investigation of the immunologic relationship between VCA graft edema and rejection responses.

{"title": "Protein kinase CK2 is a regulator of angiogenesis in endometriotic lesions.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is a frequent gynecological disease, which is crucially dependent on the process of angiogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of blood vessel development are still poorly understood. CK2 is a pleiotropic protein kinase, which is implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes including angiogenesis. Herein we studied for the first time the function of protein kinase CK2 in angiogenesis of endometriotic lesions. For this purpose, we analyzed the anti-angiogenic activity of the CK2 inhibitor quinalizarin in a rat aortic ring assay and its effect on the expression of individual CK2 subunits and on kinase activity in endometrial tissue. Moreover, endometriotic lesions were induced in dorsal skinfold chambers of quinalizarin- and vehicle-treated C57BL/6 mice to study their vascularization and morphology by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy and histology. Our results demonstrate that quinalizarin dose-dependently inhibits vascular sprouting. In addition, treatment of endometrial tissue with quinalizarin reduces CK2 activity without affecting the expression of the three CK2 subunits \u03b1, \u03b1' and \u03b2. In the dorsal skinfold chamber model of endometriosis, quinalizarin inhibits the vascularization of endometriotic lesions, which exhibit a significantly decreased vascularized area and functional capillary density when compared to those of vehicle-treated controls. This is associated with a reduced lesion size and histological fraction of endometrial glands. These findings indicate that CK2 is a regulator of angiogenesis in endometriotic lesions. Accordingly, inhibition of CK2 represents a novel option in the development of anti-angiogenic strategies for the treatment of endometriosis.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2012-02-23", "authors": ["DiluFeng", "SabrinaWelker", "ChristinaK\u00f6rbel", "JeannetteRudzitis-Auth", "Michael DMenger", "MathiasMontenarh", "Matthias WLaschke"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-012-9256-2"}
{"title": "Retrograde perfusion and filling of mouse coronary vasculature as preparation for micro computed tomography imaging.", "abstract": "Visualization of the vasculature is becoming increasingly important for understanding many different disease states. While several techniques exist for imaging vasculature, few are able to visualize the vascular network as a whole while extending to a resolution that includes the smaller vessels. Additionally, many vascular casting techniques destroy the surrounding tissue, preventing further analysis of the sample. One method which circumvents these issues is micro-Computed Tomography (\u03bcCT). \u03bcCT imaging can scan at resolutions <10 microns, is capable of producing 3D reconstructions of the vascular network, and leaves the tissue intact for subsequent analysis (e.g., histology and morphometry). However, imaging vessels by ex vivo \u03bcCT methods requires that the vessels be filled with a radiopaque compound. As such, the accurate representation of vasculature produced by \u03bcCT imaging is contingent upon reliable and complete filling of the vessels. In this protocol, we describe a technique for filling mouse coronary vessels in preparation for \u03bcCT imaging. Two predominate techniques exist for filling the coronary vasculature: in vivo via cannulation and retrograde perfusion of the aorta (or a branch off the aortic arch), or ex vivo via a Langendorff perfusion system. Here we describe an in vivo aortic cannulation method which has been specifically designed to ensure filling of all vessels. We use a low viscosity radiopaque compound called Microfil which can perfuse through the smallest vessels to fill all the capillaries, as well as both the arterial and venous sides of the vascular network. Vessels are perfused with buffer using a pressurized perfusion system, and then filled with Microfil. To ensure that Microfil fills the small higher resistance vessels, we ligate the large branches emanating from the aorta, which diverts the Microfil into the coronaries. Once filling is complete, to prevent the elastic nature of cardiac tissue from squeezing Microfil out of some vessels, we ligate accessible major vascular exit points immediately after filling. Therefore, our technique is optimized for complete filling and maximum retention of the filling agent, enabling visualization of the complete coronary vascular network--arteries, capillaries, and veins alike.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-02-23", "authors": ["Jill JWeyers", "Dara DCarlson", "Charles EMurry", "Stephen MSchwartz", "William MMahoney"], "doi": "10.3791/3740"}

We also discuss the safety and efficacy of different approaches, as well as bottlenecks hampering rapid translation of adult MSC therapy from the laboratories to the clinics. A central paradigm for the effective regeneration of bone tissue is the re-creation at the site of injury of a microenvironment as close as possible to the natural MSC repository in the body.

{"title": "Angiogenic properties of myofibroblasts isolated from normal human skin wounds.", "abstract": "During wound healing, angiogenesis plays a crucial role in inducing adequate perfusion of the new tissue, thereby allowing its survival. This angiogenic process contributes to the formation of granulation tissue, alongside myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are cells specialized in wound contraction and synthesis of new extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts, considered by some to be at the origin of myofibroblasts, have already been shown to promote neovascularization. Thus, we hypothesized that myofibroblasts play a key role during angiogenic development in wound healing. We isolated myofibroblasts from normal human skin wounds and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC) and fibroblasts from skin. Using an in vitro fibrin-based model, we compared the proangiogenic activity of wound myofibroblasts to that of fibroblasts in the presence of HDMVEC. By immunostaining with collagen IV antibodies, we observed the formation of a capillary network significantly more developed when HDMVEC were cultured with myofibroblasts compared to the network formed in the presence of fibroblasts. The differences between these cell types did not result from a differential secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor or basic Fibroblast Growth Factor. However, in the presence of myofibroblasts, a significant decrease in matrix metalloproteinase activity was observed. This finding was correlated with a significant increase in Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-3. Furthermore, inhibition of TIMP-1 secretion using shRNA significantly decreased myofibroblasts induced angiogenesis. These results led to the hypothesis that normal wound myofibroblasts contribute to the vascular network development during wound healing.

{"title": "Differentiation and gene expression profile of tumor-associated macrophages.", "abstract": "Tumor microenvironment is composed of proliferating neoplastic cells, a vascular network of endothelial cells, extra cellular matrix produced by fibroblasts, cellular compartments of adaptive immunity like lymphocytes and dendritic cells as well as cells of innate immunity, e.g., natural killer cells and macrophages. Many pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate an inversed correlation between macrophage infiltrate and patients' prognosis indicating a macrophage supporting role for tumor progression as producers of growth and angiogenic factors and as regulators of tissue remodelling. Based on in vitro models, macrophages have been classified in pro-inflammatory, classically activated macrophages (M1; stimulated by IFN-\u03b3 or LPS) and anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated macrophages (M2; stimulated by either IL-4/IL-13, IL-1\u03b2/LPS in combination with immune complexes or by IL-10/TGF\u03b2/glucocorticoids). Tumor escape has been linked with a switch from M1 activation in the early tumor initiation process towards M2-like phenotype during tumor progression, a process that highlights the heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophage activation and which offers a possible therapeutic target directed against reversing the TAM phenotype in the tumor. Here, we review different tumor-environmental stimuli and signalling cascades involved in this switch in differentiation and the so connected gene regulation in TAMs. In addition, therapeutic applications deducted from this differentiation and gene regulatory processes are presented. Data from pre-clinical as well as clinical studies clearly support the notion, that TAMs are excellent novel therapeutic targets for the fight against cancer.", "journal": "Seminars in cancer biology", "date": "2012-02-22", "authors": ["AstridSchmieder", "JuliaMichel", "KathrinSch\u00f6nhaar", "SergijGoerdt", "KaiSchledzewski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcancer.2012.02.002"}
{"title": "Characterizing the hierarchical structures of bioactive sol-gel silicate glass and hybrid scaffolds for bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Bone is the second most widely transplanted tissue after blood. Synthetic alternatives are needed that can reduce the need for transplants and regenerate bone by acting as active temporary templates for bone growth. Bioactive glasses are one of the most promising bone replacement/regeneration materials because they bond to existing bone, are degradable and stimulate new bone growth by the action of their dissolution products on cells. Sol-gel-derived bioactive glasses can be foamed to produce interconnected macropores suitable for tissue ingrowth, particularly cell migration and vascularization and cell penetration. The scaffolds fulfil many of the criteria of an ideal synthetic bone graft, but are not suitable for all bone defect sites because they are brittle. One strategy for improving toughness of the scaffolds without losing their other beneficial properties is to synthesize inorganic/organic hybrids. These hybrids have polymers introduced into the sol-gel process so that the organic and inorganic components interact at the molecular level, providing control over mechanical properties and degradation rates. However, a full understanding of how each feature or property of the glass and hybrid scaffolds affects cellular response is needed to optimize the materials and ensure long-term success and clinical products. This review focuses on the techniques that have been developed for characterizing the hierarchical structures of sol-gel glasses and hybrids, from atomic-scale amorphous networks, through the covalent bonding between components in hybrids and nanoporosity, to quantifying open macroporous networks of the scaffolds. Methods for non-destructive in situ monitoring of degradation and bioactivity mechanisms of the materials are also included.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

The aim of this first pediatric series was to determine the epidemiological characteristics and evaluate the results of different treatments in this entity.\nThis retrospective multicenter study evaluated diaphyseal bone defects in cases in which bone reconstruction was performed. BD was either initial and associated with trauma or secondary, resulting from infected non-union.\nThe series included 27 patients (17 boys and 10 girls), mean age 11.4 years old (3-16) (20 traffic accidents). At the outset of all patients' history was an open fracture (one stage 1, seven stage 2, 11 stage 3A and seven stage 3B, 1 NR). BD involved 13 tibias, 9 femurs, three humerus, one radius and one ulna. Bone defects were initial in 20 cases and secondary in seven cases. They were less than 2 cm in two cases, between 2 and 5 cm in 9 cases, between 5 and 10 cm in 10 cases and more than 10 cm in six cases. Treatment of BD was immediate in one case and delayed in 26 cases. Techniques used included: induced membrane in 10 cases, bone transport in seven cases, bone autograft in eight cases, vascularized fibular transfer in one case, no bone reconstruction in one case.

Reconstruction depends on the integrity of the periosteum. In case of an intact periosteum, bone reconstruction does not seem necessary in young children. If one part of the periosteum is intact, a simple autograft seems sufficient even with extensive bone defects. In the absence of the periosteum or especially in case of infection, the induced membrane technique seems preferable, with bone transport or a vascularized bone transfer.\nIV: retrospective study.", "journal": "Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR", "date": "2012-02-22", "authors": ["JSales de Gauzy", "FFitoussi", "J-LJouve", "CKarger", "ABadina", "A-CMasquelet", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.otsr.2012.01.001"}

This disorder, characterized by abnormal vascularization of the retina, tends to occur in low birth weight neonates after exposure to high supplemental oxygen. Currently, the incidence of ROP is increasing because of increased survival of these infants due to medical progress. However, little is known about changes in the chronic phase after ROP. Therefore, in this study, we examined morphological and functional changes in the retina using a chronic OIR model. Both the a- and b-waves in the OIR model recovered in a time-dependent manner at 4 weeks (w), 6 w, and 8 w, but the oscillatory potential (OP) amplitudes remained depressed following a return to normoxic conditions. Furthermore, decrease in the thicknesses of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) at postnatal day (P) 17, 4 w, and 8 w and hyperpermeability of blood vessels were observed in conjunction with the decrease in the expression of claudin-5 and occludin at 8 w. The chronic OIR model revealed the following: (1) a decrease in OP amplitudes, (2) morphological abnormalities in the retinal cells (limited to the IPL and INL) and blood vessels, and (3) an increase in retinal vascular permeability via the impairment of the tight junction proteins.

The optimal position for 3D acquisition of cord insertion into the placenta was identified and static 3D-PDU volumes were acquired using consistent machine configurations. Without moving the probe or the participant changing position, successive 3D volumes were stored at -3, -5, -7 and -9\u2009dB and at the individualized sub-noise gain (SNG) level. Volumes were excluded if flash artifact was present, in which case all five volumes were reacquired. Using 4D View software, the cord insertion was magnified and the smallest sphere possible was used to measure vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). The associations between VOCAL indices and gain level were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nVOCAL indices for cord insertion correlated poorly with gain level, whether fundamental or relative to SNG level (R(2) = 0.07 and 0.04, respectively). VI was consistently 100% and mean FI and VFI were 99.5 (SD, 0.57), with all values > 97 irrespective of gain level.\nWhilst previous work has shown that gain correlates well with placental tissue VOCAL indices, the correlation between gain level and VOCAL indices in an area of 100% vascularity at the cord insertion is poor. Regions of 100% vascularity appear to be artificially assigned a value approaching 100% for all VOCAL indices irrespective of gain level.

{"title": "Biologic scaffold remodeling in a dog model of complex musculoskeletal injury.", "abstract": "Current treatment principles for muscle injuries with volumetric loss have been largely derived from empirical observations. Differences in severity or anatomic location have determinant effects on the tissue remodeling outcome. Biologic scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been successfully used to restore vascularized, innervated, and contractile skeletal muscle in animal models but limited anatomic locations have been evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of a xenogeneic ECM scaffold to restore functional skeletal muscle in a canine model of a complex quadriceps injury involving bone, tendon, and muscle.\nSixteen dogs were subjected to unilateral resection of the distal third of the vastus lateralis and medial half of the distal third of the vastus medialis muscles including the proximal half of their associated quadriceps tendon. This defect was replaced with a biologic scaffold composed of small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) and the remodeling response was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, and 6 mo (N = 4 per group).\nThe initial remodeling process followed a similar pattern to other studies of ECM-mediated muscle repair with rapid vascularization and migration of myoblasts into the defect site. However, over time the remodeling response resulted in the formation of dense collagenous tissue with islands of muscle in the segments of the scaffold not in contact with bone, and foci of bone and cartilage in the segments that were adjacent to the underlying bone.\nSIS-ECM was not successful at restoring functional muscle tissue in this model. However, the results also suggest that SIS-ECM may have potential to promote integration of soft and boney tissues when implanted in close apposition to bone.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2012-02-22", "authors": ["Neill JTurner", "John SBadylak", "Douglas JWeber", "Stephen FBadylak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.1029"}
{"title": "Regulation of bone-renal mineral and energy metabolism: the PHEX, FGF23, DMP1, MEPE ASARM pathway.", "abstract": "More than 300 million years ago, vertebrates emerged from the vast oceans to conquer gravity and the dry land. With this transition, new adaptations occurred that included ingenious changes in reproduction, waste secretion, and bone physiology. One new innovation, the egg shell, contained an ancestral protein (ovocleidin-116) that likely first appeared with the dinosaurs and was preserved through the theropod lineage in modern birds and reptiles. Ovocleidin-116 is an avian homolog of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) and belongs to a group of proteins called short integrin-binding ligand-interacting glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). These proteins are all localized to a defined region on chromosome 5q in mice and chromosome 4q in humans. A unifying feature of SIBLING proteins is an acidic serine aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM). Recent research has shown that the ASARM motif and the released ASARM peptide have regulatory roles in mineralization (bone and teeth), phosphate regulation, vascularization, soft-tissue calcification, osteoclastogenesis, mechanotransduction, and fat energy metabolism. The MEPE ASARM motif and peptide are physiological substrates for PHEX, a zinc metalloendopeptidase. Defects in PHEX are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HYP). There is evidence that PHEX interacts with another ASARM motif containing SIBLING protein, dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1). DMP1 mutations cause bone and renal defects that are identical with the defects caused by a loss of PHEX function. This results in autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR). In both HYP and ARHR, increased FGF23 expression plays a major role in the disease and in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), FGF23 half-life is increased by activating mutations. ASARM peptide administration in vitro and in vivo also induces increased FGF23 expression. FGF23 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of cytokines, which surfaced 500 million years ago with the boney fish (i.e., teleosts) that do not contain SIBLING proteins. In terrestrial vertebrates, FGF23, like SIBLING proteins, is expressed in the osteocyte. The boney fish, however, are an-osteocytic, so a physiological bone-renal link with FGF23 and the SIBLINGs was cemented when life ventured from the oceans to the land during the Triassic period, approximately 300 million years ago. This link has been revealed by recent research that indicates a competitive displacement of a PHEX-DMP1 interaction by an ASARM peptide that leads to increased FGF23 expression. This review discusses the new discoveries that reveal a novel PHEX, DMP1, MEPE, ASARM peptide, and FGF23 bone-renal pathway. This pathway impacts not only bone formation, bone-renal mineralization, and renal phosphate homeostasis but also energy metabolism. The study of this new pathway is relevant for developing therapies for several diseases: bone-teeth mineral loss disorders, renal osteodystrophy, chronic kidney disease and bone mineralization disorders (CKD-MBD), end-stage renal diseases, ectopic arterial-calcification, cardiovascular disease renal calcification, diabetes, and obesity.", "journal": "Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression", "date": "2012-02-22", "authors": ["Peter S NRowe"], "doi": "10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v22.i1.50"}

The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial study is to compare the effect of flapless (FL) and full-thickness flap (FT) techniques on crestal bone resorption during healing periods.\nTwenty-two implants were placed by FL and FT flap in nine patients in split mouth design; each patient received two implants, except for two patients who received four implants. A periapical radiograph was taken at implant placement, as well as 6- and 12-week intervals. Crestal bone level was compared between FL and FT during these intervals and compared between intervals for each group.\nMedian (IQR) crestal bone level at implant placement for the FL was 2.70 (0.60) and for the FT was 2.60 (1.20). At six weeks, median (IQR) for the FL was 3.55 (0.70) and for the FT was 3.40 (0.75). At 12 weeks, median (IQR) for the FL was 3.60 (0.30) and for the FT was 3.75 (0.85). Statistically insignificant differences were obtained between the two techniques at implant placement, as well as 6- and 12-week intervals, and were p = 0.894, p = 0.477, p = 0.755, respectively. There was a significant difference between the bone level at implant placement and at the 6-week interval for both the FL (p = 0.006) and FT (p = 0.045), whereas there was no significant difference between the bone level at 6- and 12-week intervals for the FL (p = 0.722) and for the FT (p = 0.229). Conclusions Based upon this study of nine patients with 22 implants, there was no significant difference in crestal bone resorption between FT and FL techniques during a three-month healing period.

We have demonstrated the contribution of apoptotic human CEM T lymphocyte-derived microparticles (LMPs) as inhibitors of angiogenic responses in animal models of inflammation and tumor growth. In the present study, we characterized the antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) effects of LMPs on pathological angiogenesis in an animal model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and explored the role of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the effects of LMPs on human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). LMPs dramatically inhibited cell growth of HRECs, suppressed VEGF-induced cell migration in vitro experiments, and attenuated VEGF-induced retinal vascular leakage in vivo. Intravitreal injections of fluorescently labeled LMPs revealed accumulation of LMPs in retinal tissue, with more than 60% reductions of the vascular density in retinas of rats with oxygen-induced neovascularization. LMP uptake experiments demonstrated that the interaction between LMPs and HRECs is dependent on temperature. In addition, endocytosis is partially dependent on extracellular calcium. RNAi-mediated knockdown of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) reduced the uptake of LMPs and attenuated the inhibitory effects of LMPs on VEGF-A protein expression and HRECs cell growth. Intravitreal injection of lentivirus-mediated RNA interference reduced LDLR protein expression in retina by 53% and significantly blocked the antiangiogenic effects of LMPs on pathological vascularization. In summary, the potent antiangiogenic LMPs lead to a significant reduction of pathological retinal angiogenesis through modulation of VEGF signaling, whereas LDLR-mediated endocytosis plays a partial, but pivotal, role in the uptake of LMPs in HRECs.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

After creating a conjunctival defect at the center of ischemic conjunctiva, a CG matrix was implanted into subconjunctival space to evaluate the conjunctival reepithelialization and angiogenesis during the wound healing process. In the grafted group, the vessel count of the healed conjunctiva was substantially elevated by two fold within the initial 4 weeks and the increased vascular content originated mostly from the fornix site. The rate of conjunctival reepithelialization was not retarded in the grafted group, and the final thickness of healed conjunctiva was similar in both grafted and ungrafted groups. The histological studies revealed that the collagen matrix did not elicit pronounced inflammatory reaction and the regenerated conjunctiva showed loosely arranged collagen deposition without significant scar formation. The \u03b1 SMA staining positive myofibroblasts were identified in the acute inflammatory stage and were absent, 8 weeks after implantation in both groups.

Instead, surgeons should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative in a given clinical situation, and select the material with lowest overall cost and morbidity, and the highest likelihood of success. Autogenous bone is still considered the gold standard for most applications; it becomes vascularized and osseointegrates with surrounding bone, thus minimizing the risk of infection, dislodgement, or break-down. Limitations include added operative time for graft harvest, donor site morbidity, graft resorption, molding challenges, and limited availability, especially in the pediatric population. Numerous alternatives to bone graft have become available to address these limitations; unfortunately, most of these products are expensive, do not osseointegrate, and have unpredictable biologic activity.

However, the vascular network in tumors is not well organized and fails to meet metabolic needs to maintain tissue homeostasis, resulting in significant hypoxia. Among various tumors, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) typically develops in an unusually disordered microenvironment, which contributes to its highly aggressive behavior. Since anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Avastin) has failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in PDAC, we need to re-visit the basic biology of this disease and understand what makes it so refractory to the anti-angiogenic approaches that are clinically effective in other neoplasms. To address this issue, we specifically focused on the process of neovascularization where bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) play a role during pancreatic tumorigenesis. We have identified subsets of BMDCs that regulate key processes during development of the neovessels through paracrine Hedgehog signaling. Considering the importance of systemic responses occurring in tumor bearing hosts, we are currently using genetically engineered mice, which spontaneously develop PDAC, Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D);p53(lox/+) strain, to clarify critical events that can trigger aberrant angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer.

{"title": "Cell-to-cell signaling influences the fate of prostate cancer stem cells and their potential to generate more aggressive tumors.", "abstract": "An increasing number of malignancies has been shown to be initiated and propelled by small subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSC). However, whether tumor aggressiveness is driven by CSC and by what extent this property may be relevant within the tumor mass is still unsettled. To address this issue, we isolated a rare tumor cell population on the basis of its CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype from the human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 and established its CSC properties. The behavior of selected CSC was investigated with respect to the bulk DU145 cells. The injection of CSC in nude mice generated highly vascularized tumors infiltrating the adjacent tissues, showing high density of neuroendocrine cells and expressing low levels of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin as well as high levels of vimentin. On the contrary, when a comparable number of unsorted DU145 cells were injected the resulting tumors were less aggressive. To investigate the different features of tumors in vivo, the influence of differentiated tumor cells on CSC was examined in vitro by growing CSC in the absence or presence of conditioned medium from DU145 cells. CSC grown in permissive conditions differentiated into cell populations with features similar to those of cells held in aggressive tumors generated from CSC injection. Differently, conditioned medium induced CSC to differentiate into a cell phenotype comparable to cells of scarcely aggressive tumors originated from bulk DU145 cell injection. These findings show for the first time that CSC are able to generate differentiated cells expressing either highly or scarcely aggressive phenotype, thus influencing prostate cancer progression. The fate of CSC was determined by signals released from tumor environment.

Our current tissue-engineering methods result in three-dimensional (3D) muscle constructs that generate tension but do not advance phenotypically beyond neonatal characteristics. To develop to an adult phenotype, innervation and vascularization of the construct must occur. In this study, 3D muscle constructs were implanted into the hindlimb of a rat, along the sciatic nerve, with the sural nerve isolated, transected and sutured to the construct to encourage innervation. Aortic ring anchors were sutured to the tendons of the biceps femoris muscle so that the construct would move dynamically with the endogenous muscle. After 1\u2009week in vivo, the constructs were explanted, evaluated for force production and stained for muscle, nerve and collagen markers. Implanted muscle constructs showed a developing capillary system, an epimysium-like outer layer of connective tissue and an increase in myofibre content. The beginning of \u03b1-bungarotoxin clustering suggests that neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) could form on the implanted muscle, given more time in vivo.

{"title": "Fibroblast growth factor-2 facilitates rapid anastomosis formation between bioengineered human vascular networks and living vasculature.", "abstract": "Many common diseases involve the injury, loss, or death of organ tissues. For these patients, organ transplantation is often the only viable solution. Nonetheless, organ transplantation is seriously limited by the relative scarcity of living and non-living donors, a situation that is worsening with aging of the world population. Tissue Engineering (TE) is a research discipline in regenerative medicine that aims to generate tissues in the laboratory that can replace diseased and damaged tissues in patients. Crucially, engineered tissues must have a vascular network that guarantees adequate nutrient supply, gas exchange, and elimination of waste products. Therefore, the search for clinically relevant sources of vasculogenic cells and the subsequent development of methods to achieve rapid vascularization is of utmost importance. We and others have previously shown that human blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) have the required vasculogenic capacity to form functional vascular networks in vivo. These studies demonstrated that, in the presence of an appropriate source of perivascular cells, ECFCs can self-assemble into microvascular networks and connect to the host vasculature, a process that takes approximately 7days in vivo. The prospect is to incorporate these vascular networks into future engineered tissues. However, engineered tissues must have a functional vasculature immediately after implantation in order to preserve viability and function. Thus, it is critical to further develop strategies for rapid formation of perfused vascular network in vivo. Here, we describe a methodology to deliver ECFCs and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). This approach significantly reduces the time needed to achieve functional anastomoses between bioengineered human blood vessels and the host vasculature. This methodology includes (1) isolation, characterization and culture of ECFCs, (2) isolation, characterization and culture of MSCs, and (3) implantation of ECFCs and MSCs, in the presence of FGF-2, into immunodeficient mice to generate perfused vascular networks.", "journal": "Methods (San Diego, Calif.)", "date": "2012-02-14", "authors": ["Ruei-ZengLin", "Juan MMelero-Martin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.01.006"}

{"title": "N-glycans in cell survival and death: cross-talk between glycosyltransferases.", "abstract": "Asparagine-linked (N-linked) protein glycosylation is one of the most important protein modifications. N-glycans with \"high mannose\", \"hybrid\", or \"complex\" type sugar chains participate in a multitude of cellular processes. These include cell-cell/cell-matrix/receptor-ligand interaction, cell signaling/growth and differentiation, to name a few. Many diseases such as disorders of blood clotting, congenital disorder of glycosylation, diseases of blood vessels, cancer, neo-vascularization, i.e., angiogenesis essential for breast and other solid tumor progression and metastasis are associated with N-glycan expression. Biosynthesis of N-glycans requires multiple steps and multiple cellular compartments. Following transcription and translation the proteins migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to acquire glycan chain(s) with a defined glycoform, i.e., a tetradecasaccharide. These are further modified, i.e., edited in ER lumen and in Golgi prior to moving to their respective destinations. The tetradecasaccharide is pre-assembled on a poly-isoprenoid lipid called dolichol, and becomes an essential component of the supply chain. Therefore, dolichol cycle synthesizing the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) is a hallmark for all N-linked glycoproteins. It is expected that there is a great deal of cross-talk between the participating glycosyltransferases and any missed step would express defective N-glycans that could have fatal consequences. The positive impact of the structurally altered N-glycans could lead to discovery of an N-glycan signature for a disease and/or help developing glycotherapeutic treating cancer or other human diseases. The purpose of this review is to identify the gaps of N-glycan biology and help developing appropriate technology for biomedical applications.

{"title": "The vascular endothelium of the adipose tissue gives rise to both white and brown fat cells.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue expansion involves the enlargement of existing adipocytes, the formation of new cells from committed preadipocytes, and the coordinated development of the tissue vascular network. Here we find that murine endothelial cells (ECs) of classic white and brown fat depots share ultrastructural characteristics with pericytes, which are pluripotent and can potentially give rise to preadipocytes. Lineage tracing experiments using the VE-cadherin promoter reveal localization of reporter genes in ECs and also in preadipocytes and adipocytes of white and brown fat depots. Furthermore, capillary sprouts from human adipose tissue, which have predominantly EC characteristics, are found to express Zfp423, a recently identified marker of preadipocyte determination. In response to PPAR\u03b3 activation, endothelial characteristics of sprouting cells are progressively lost, and cells form structurally and biochemically defined adipocytes.

We used a Voluson E8 ultrasound system with a 6-12-MHz transvaginal transducer. Ovarian volume, number and volume of antral follicles \u22652 mm, vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated using the virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL\u2122) and sonography-based automated volume calculation (SonoAVC\u2122) software. Results are described separately for women with follicles 2.0-10.0 mm and for those with at least one follicle >10.0 mm for two age groups: 20-29 years (n=166) and 30-39 years (n=47). Results are also compared between women on monophasic (n=151) and triphasic (n=59) COC, and between women using COC with older (n=110) and newer (n=100) progestins and different doses of estrogen.\nOne hundred eighty-nine (89%) women had follicles 2.0-10.0 mm, and 24 (11%) had follicle(s) >10.0 mm. The proportion of women with follicle(s) >10.0 mm did not differ between women with different types of COC. In women with follicles 2.0-10.0 mm, the right ovary was larger (mean difference 0.5 cm(3) [95% confidence interval 0.22-0.82]) and contained more follicles (mean difference 1.5 [0.52-2.56]) than the left one in the age group 20-29 years. The same differences between the right and left ovary were seen in women 30-39 years old, but they were not statistically significant. In both ovaries, the number of antral follicles 2.0-10.0 mm [median (range)] was significantly higher in women 20-29 than in those 30-39 years old [11 (2-34) vs. 8 (1-26), p=.012 for the right ovary; 9 (0-28) vs. 7 (1-28), p=.035 for the left ovary]. Ovarian volume tended to be smaller in women 20-29 than in those 30-39 years old, but the differences were not statistically significant. Size of the largest follicle, total follicular volume and vascular indices manifested no clear differences between the age groups. For all 378 ovaries with follicles \u226410 mm, ovarian volume ranged from 1 to 16 cm(3) (median 5), total follicular volume ranged from 0.03 to 2.7 cm(3) (median 0.7), VI ranged from 0.0 % to 13.4% (median 0.97), FI ranged from 0 to 38 (median 25), and VFI ranged from 0.0 to 4.7 (median 0.3).\nOur results show estimated ranges of 3D grayscale and power Doppler ultrasound measurements in ovaries of women using COC.", "journal": "Contraception", "date": "2012-02-14", "authors": ["LigitaJokubkiene", "PovilasSladkevicius", "LilValentin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.contraception.2011.12.013"}

While results have been encouraging, acute rejection rates are higher than in their solid-organ counterparts. In contrast, chronic rejections, as defined by vasculopathy and/or fibrosis and atrophy of skin and other tissues, as well as antibody mediated rejection, have not been reported in a compliant hand transplant recipient. Monitoring vascularized composite allograft (VCA) hand recipients for rejection has routinely involved punch skin biopsies, vascular imaging and graft appearance. Our program, which has transplanted a total of 6 hand recipients, has experience which challenges these precepts. We present evidence that the vessels, both arteries and veins may also be a primary target of rejection in the hand. Two of our recipients developed severe intimal hyperplasia and vasculopathy early post-transplant. An analysis of events and our four other patients has shown that the standard techniques used for surveillance of rejection (i.e. punch skin biopsies, DSA and conventional vascular imaging studies) are inadequate for detecting the early stages of vasculopathy. In response, we have initiated studies using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) to evaluate the vessel wall thickness.

In this study, the authors aimed to demonstrate the antiangiogenic activity of aganirsen in animal models of retinal neovascularization.\nEyedrops of aganirsen were applied daily in nonhuman primates after laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV; model of wet age-related macular degeneration [AMD]) and in newborn rats after oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR; model of ischemic retinopathy). Retinal aganirsen concentrations were assessed in rabbits and monkeys after topical delivery (21.5, 43, or 86 \u03bcg). Clinical significance was further evaluated by determination of IRS-1 expression in monkey and human retinal biopsy specimens.\nTopical corneal application of aganirsen attenuated neovascular lesion development dose dependently in African green monkeys. The incidence of high-grade CNV lesions (grade IV) decreased from 20.5% in vehicle-treated animals to 1.7% (P < 0.05) at the 86-\u03bcg dose. Topical aganirsen inhibited retinal neovascularization after OIR in rats (P < 0.05); furthermore, a single intravitreal injection of aganirsen reduced OIR as effectively as ranibizumab, and their effects were additive. Significantly, topical applications of aganirsen did not interfere with physiological retinal vessel development in newborn rats. Retinal delivery after topical administration was confirmed, and retinal expression of IRS-1 was demonstrated to be elevated in patients with subretinal neovascularization and AMD.\nTopical application of aganirsen offers a safe and effective therapy for both choroidal and retinal neovascularization without preventing its normal vascularization.

{"title": "The peritoneal tumour microenvironment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.", "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) disseminates early and extensively throughout the peritoneal space, causing multiple lesions that are a major clinical problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular composition of peritoneal tumour deposits in patient biopsies and their evolution in mouse models using immunohistochemistry, intravital microscopy, confocal microscopy, and 3D modelling. Tumour deposits from the omentum of HGSC patients contained a prominent leukocyte infiltrate of CD3(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages, with occasional neutrophils. Alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) (\u03b1-SMA(+) ) pericytes and/or fibroblasts surrounded these well-vascularized tumour deposits. Using the murine bowel mesentery as an accessible mouse peritoneal tissue that could be easily imaged, and two different transplantable models, we found multiple microscopic tumour deposits after i.p. injection of malignant cells. Attachment to the peritoneal surface was rapid (6-48 h) with an extensive CD45(+) leukocyte infiltrate visible by 48 h. This infiltrate persisted until end point and in the syngeneic murine ID8 model, it primarily consisted of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD68(+) macrophages with \u03b1-SMA(+) cells also involved from the earliest stages. A majority of tumour deposits developed above existing mesenteric blood vessels, but in avascular spaces new blood vessels tracked towards the tumour deposits by 2-3 weeks in the IGROV-1 xenografts and 6 weeks in the ID8 syngeneic model; a vigorous convoluted blood supply was established by end point. Inhibition of tumour cell cytokine production by stable expression of shRNA to CXCR4 in IGROV-1 cells did not influence the attachment of cells to the mesentery but delayed neovascularization and reduced tumour deposit size. We conclude that the multiple peritoneal tumour deposits found in HGSC patients can be modelled in the mouse.

{"title": "The balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms regulate follicle development.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) has been extensively studied because of its role in follicular development and is a principal angiogenic factor essential for angiogenesis. Since vascularization of the theca layer increases as follicles progress in size through preantral and antral stages, VEGFA might influence follicle growth via the regulation of angiogenesis. However, VEGFA might also influence follicular development through nonangiogenic mechanisms, since its expression has been localized in nonvascular follicles and cells. Alternative mRNA splicing of eight exons from the VEGFA gene results in the formation of various VEGFA isoforms. Each isoform has unique properties and is identified by the number of amino acids within the mature protein. Proangiogenic isoforms (VEGFA_XXX) are encoded by exon 8a, whereas a sister set of isoforms (VEGFA_XXXB) with antiangiogenic properties is encoded by exon 8b. The antiangiogenic VEGFA_XXXB isoforms comprise the majority of VEGFA expressed in most tissues, whereas expression of the proangiogenic VEGFA isoforms is upregulated in tissues undergoing active angiogenesis. Although proangiogenic and antiangiogenic isoforms can now be distinguished from one another, many studies evaluating VEGFA in ovarian and follicular development up to now have not differentiated proangiogenic VEGFA from antiangiogenic VEGFA. Experiments from our laboratory indicate that proangiogenic VEGFA promotes follicle recruitment and early follicular development and antiangiogenic VEGFA inhibits these processes. The balance of proangiogenic versus antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms is thus of importance during follicle development.

Furthermore, PTX treatment also increased the gene expression of VEGF189 and VEGF165, increased VEGF protein expression, and improved pulmonary vascularization.\nThese data indicate that the reduced lung edema and inflammation, increased AOE activities, and improved vascularization may be responsible for the improved survival with PTX during hyperoxia.

{"title": "Microglia in the developing brain: a potential target with lifetime effects.", "abstract": "Microglia are a heterogenous group of monocyte-derived cells serving multiple roles within the brain, many of which are associated with immune and macrophage like properties. These cells are known to serve a critical role during brain injury and to maintain homeostasis; yet, their defined roles during development have yet to be elucidated. Microglial actions appear to influence events associated with neuronal proliferation and differentiation during development, as well as, contribute to processes associated with the removal of dying neurons or cellular debris and management of synaptic connections. These long-lived cells display changes during injury and with aging that are critical to the maintenance of the neuronal environment over the lifespan of the organism. These processes may be altered by changes in the colonization of the brain or by inflammatory events during development. This review addresses the role of microglia during brain development, both structurally and functionally, as well as the inherent vulnerability of the developing nervous system. A framework is presented considering microglia as a critical nervous system-specific cell that can influence multiple aspects of brain development (e.g., vascularization, synaptogenesis, and myelination) and have a long term impact on the functional vulnerability of the nervous system to a subsequent insult, whether environmental, physical, age-related, or disease-related.", "journal": "Neurotoxicology", "date": "2012-02-11", "authors": ["G JeanHarry", "Andrew DKraft"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuro.2012.01.012"}

To describe the behavior emerging from autonomous cell motility, cell-cell adhesion and contact guidance by ECM filaments, we propose a suitably modified cellular Potts model. We consider an active cell motility process in which internal polarity is governed by a positive feedback from cell displacements, a mechanism that can result in highly persistent motion when constrained by an oriented ECM structure. The model allows us to explore the interplay between haptotaxis, matrix degradation and active cell movement. We show that for certain conditions the cells are able to both invade the ECM and follow the ECM tracks.

{"title": "Abnormal tumor vasculatures and bone marrow-derived pro-angiogenic cells in cancer.", "abstract": "Tumor-derived factors affect the stroma of cancer tissue by activating pro-angiogenic signals. One of the key components of this response is the mobilization of the pro-angiogenic cells from bone marrow (BM), which contribute to the development of abnormal tumor vasculature. Evidence is accumulating that the pro-angiogenic cells derived from BM are involved in the physiological processes of tissue repair and wound healing. However, vascular structure in cancer tissue is impaired, resulting in the formation of chaotic neo-vessels and hypoxic microenvironments. Ultimately, these structural and functional abnormalities result in the limited delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and create regions of metabolic derangement, both of which enhance resistance to chemotherapy. In spite of recent advances in targeted therapy using anti-vascular agents, clinical results from studies using individual agents have unsatisfactory, necessitating the combinatorial use of anti-cancer drugs and a targeting agent. We suggest the possibility of a new therapeutic approach in which aberrant tumor vessels are normalized by BM-derived pro-angiogenic cells, and the delivery of anti-cancer drugs is maximized. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of the structure and function of tumor vessels, and an alternative approach to the repair of abnormal tumor vasculature by the use of BM-derived pro-angiogenic cells. This approach may improve both the delivery and the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs by restoring aberrant tumor vascularization and hypoxia.", "journal": "International journal of hematology", "date": "2012-02-09", "authors": ["YusukeMizukami", "JunpeiSasajima", "ToshifumiAshida", "YutakaKohgo"], "doi": "10.1007/s12185-012-1017-x"}

Multivariate models with multiple imputations were used to evaluate the associations with acute renal failure and new-onset stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nThe median WIT was 21 minutes (range 4-55), the median percentage of kidney preserved was 80% (range 25%-98%), and the median preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 11-133).

This article describes a case of surgical treatment of a chondroblastoma of the femoral head with the use of a free vascularized fibula graft. A 26-year-old woman had several months of increasing left hip pain and decreased range of motion. Imaging studies confirmed a large bubbly lesion with sclerotic borders in the left femoral head consistent with chondroblastoma.

However, studies to date have not investigated esophageal carcinoma. Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory effect of ACE inhibitors on growth of esophageal carcinoma xenografts. We used the EC9706 cell line, which expresses the highest vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA level, to establish xenografts in 21 BALB/c nude mice. The mice were then randomly allocated to receive normal saline, perindopril (4 mg/kg), or benazepril (6 mg/kg). Five weeks later, the nude mice were sacrificed and all tumors were dissected and weighed. The number of microvessels was counted by immunostaining endothelial cells for CD31 and the microvessel density was assessed. The EC9706 cell line showed the highest expression of VEGF mRNA of four esophageal squamous cell carcinoma lines. After treatment, the average tumor inhibitory rate in the benazepril group was 45.4%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Similar findings were observed when we used tumor weight as an index for tumor growth inhibition (P < 0.05). By contrast, there was no significant difference between the perindopril group and the control group (P > 0.05). The benazepril group appeared to show less vascularization than the control group (P < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference between the perindopril group and the control group (P > 0.05). The EC9706 cell line showed the highest expression of VEGF mRNA level of the four esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines examined.

Using purification of multiple progenitor subtypes based on a conserved stem cell function, high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity (ALDH(hi)), we have recently shown that transplantation of BM-derived ALDH(hi) progenitors improved systemic hyperglycemia and augmented insulin secretion by increasing islet-associated proliferation and vascularization, without increasing islet number. Conversely, transplantation of culture-expanded multipotent-stromal cells (MSCs) derived from BM ALDH(hi) cells augmented total beta cell mass via formation of beta cell clusters associated with the ductal epithelium, without sustained islet vascularization. To identify paracrine effectors produced by islet-regenerative MSCs, culture-expanded BM ALDH(hi) MSCs were transplanted into streptozotocin-treated nonobese diabetic/severe combine immune deficient (SCID) mice and segregated into islet-regenerative versus nonregenerative cohorts based on hyperglycemia reduction, and subsequently compared for differential production of mRNA and secreted proteins. Regenerative MSCs showed increased expression of matrix metalloproteases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating ligands, and downstream effectors of Wnt signaling. Regenerative MSC supernatant also contained increased levels of pro-angiogenic versus pro-inflammatory cytokines, and augmented the expansion of ductal epithelial but not beta cells in vitro. Conversely, co-culture with UCB ALDH(hi) cells induced beta cell but not ductal epithelial cell proliferation. Sequential transplantation of MSCs followed by UCB ALDH(hi) cells improved hyperglycemia and glucose tolerance by increasing beta cell mass associated with the ductal epithelium and by augmenting intra-islet capillary densities. Thus, combinatorial human progenitor cell transplantation stimulated both islet-regenerative and revascularization programs.

We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of APN deficiency in allografted malignant (tumor) and nonmalignant (host) cells on tumor growth and metastasis in APN-null mice. In two independent tumor graft models, APN activity in both the tumors and the host cells cooperate to promote tumor vascularization and growth.

Coverage of such defects using free flaps is too lengthy and complex for use in elderly patients. Although quick and simple, pedicled flaps are often considered to be contraindicated in patients with occlusive artery disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of pedicled flaps harvested after evaluation of revascularized territories on angiograms for coverage of tissue defects.\nFrom 1994 to 2000, a total of 23 pedicled flap procedures were performed in 22 patients with a mean age of 75 years (range, 54-91 years). The distal anastomosis of the bypass was located on a tibial or pedal artery in 19 cases and on the popliteal artery in 4. The indication for flap placement was chronic ulcer in 7 cases, secondary graft exposure in 15, and open fracture with acute ischemia in 1. To be considered as usable, the flap had to be vascularized by a pedicle fed by the bypassed artery and have a rotational axis sufficient to cover the defect. Muscle flaps were used in 11 cases, fasciocutaneous flaps in 10, and fascial flaps in 2.\nThe flap procedures in this study led to primary healing in 17 cases, secondary healing in 4 cases, and failure due to necrosis in 2.

The microscopic appearance was remarkably consistent and was characterized by 2 components: a relatively uniform proliferation of bland, spindle-shaped cells with inconspicuous cytoplasm and ovoid-to-tapering nuclei set in a variably collagenous or myxoid stroma and a prominent vascular network composed of numerous small, branching, thin-walled blood vessels, often accompanied by medium-sized round or irregular and ectatic vessels. Mitoses (1-4/10 hpf) were occasionally observed (9 cases). Mild degenerative nuclear atypia was uncommon (5 cases). Tumor cells expressed epithelial membrane antigen at least focally in 16 of 36 cases (44%), CD34 and smooth muscle actin in 5 cases (14%), and desmin in 4 cases (11%); none expressed S100 protein. Five out of 6 cases analyzed cytogenetically showed a simple karyotype with a balanced t(5;8) chromosomal translocation. Treatment consisted of surgical resection: either simple excision (29 cases), wide excision (6 cases), or amputation (1 case). Follow-up information was available for 28 patients (range, 6 to 144 mo; mean, 51.9 mo). Most patients were alive with no evidence of disease, regardless of the status of surgical resection margins. Four patients developed local recurrence 9, 13, 36, and 120 months after the primary tumor was removed; only in 1 case was there an association with extensively positive surgical resection margins. One of these patients developed a second recurrence 2 months after the first one. None of the patients developed metastasis. The designation \"angiofibroma of soft tissue\" is proposed to reflect both the likely fibroblastic nature of the proliferating cells and the prominent vascularization of this benign soft tissue neoplasm.", "journal": "The American journal of surgical pathology", "date": "2012-02-04", "authors": ["Adri\u00e1nMari\u00f1o-Enr\u00edquez", "Christopher D MFletcher"], "doi": "10.1097/PAS.0b013e31823defbe"}

Dental pulp stem cells, have a potential use in dental tissue generation. However, specific requirements to drive the dental tissue generation are still obscured. We established an in vivo model for studying the survival of dental pulp cells (DPC) and their potential to generate dental pulp tissue. DPC were mixed with collagen scaffold with or without slow release bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The cell suspension was transplanted into a vascularized tissue engineering chamber in the rat groin. Tissue constructs were harvested after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks and processed for histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis. After 2 weeks newly formed tissue with new blood vessel formation were observed inside the chamber. DPC were found around dentin, particularly around the vascular pedicle and also close to the gelatin microspheres. Cell survival, was confirmed up to 8 weeks after transplantation. Dentin Sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) positive matrix production was detected in the chamber, indicating functionality of dental pulp progenitor cells.

{"title": "Scaphoid fractures: what's hot, what's not.", "abstract": "The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone of the wrist. It is an unusual carpal bone in that it bridges both the proximal and the distal rows; this subjects it to continuous shearing and bending forces. Approximately 80% of the scaphoid is covered by cartilage, which limits its ligamentous attachment and vascular supply. Most scaphoid fractures occur at the waist. Acute stable fractures or incomplete fractures of the scaphoid may be treated nonsurgically; a high rate of union can be expected. However, there is considerable debate about the type of immobilization needed. Although closed treatment of stable wrist fractures of the scaphoid achieve a high rate of healing, prolonged cast immobilization may lead to complications, including muscle atrophy, possible joint contracture, and disuse osteopenia. Because of this, internal fixation of minimally displaced fractures of the scaphoid has recently become popular. There is consensus in the literature that nonunion of the scaphoid and proximal pole fractures should be treated surgically. In the past several decades, percutaneous arthroscopic techniques of scaphoid stabilization, which minimize surgical morbidity, have become popular. There also has been a significant improvement in the management of difficult scaphoid nonunions, with or without deformity. Improved techniques include open and dorsal approaches and vascularized bone grafting of resistant scaphoid nonunions. Declining in popularity is the prolonged immobilization of unstable fractures when surgical stabilization may have been a better treatment option.", "journal": "Instructional course lectures", "date": "2012-02-04", "authors": ["William BGeissler", "Julie EAdams", "Randy RBindra", "William DLanzinger", "David JSlutsky"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Mathematical modeling of solid cancer growth with angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Cancer arises when within a single cell multiple malfunctions of control systems occur, which are, broadly, the system that promote cell growth and the system that protect against erratic growth. Additional systems within the cell must be corrupted so that a cancer cell, to form a mass of any real size, produces substances that promote the growth of new blood vessels. Multiple mutations are required before a normal cell can become a cancer cell by corruption of multiple growth-promoting systems.\nWe develop a simple mathematical model to describe the solid cancer growth dynamics inducing angiogenesis in the absence of cancer controlling mechanisms.\nThe initial conditions supplied to the dynamical system consist of a perturbation in form of pulse: The origin of cancer cells from normal cells of an organ of human body. Thresholds of interacting parameters were obtained from the steady states analysis. The existence of two equilibrium points determine the strong dependency of dynamical trajectories on the initial conditions. The thresholds can be used to control cancer.\nCancer can be settled in an organ if the following combination matches: better fitness of cancer cells, decrease in the efficiency of the repairing systems, increase in the capacity of sprouting from existing vascularization, and higher capacity of mounting up new vascularization.

In addition to nonabsorbable barriers, various collagens have become accepted as membrane materials for separating the graft from soft tissue. However, collagen membranes differ significantly in their barrier function and biocompatibility. The objective of this pilot study was to examine, in vitro and in vivo, a novel native collagen membrane extracted from porcine pericardium.\nThe morphologic structure of two different native collagen membranes (Remotis, Thommen Medical; Bio-Gide, Geistlich Biomaterials) was examined using a scanning electron microscope. For biocompatibility testing, membranes were incubated with SaOs-2 osteoblastlike cells. After 2 hours, 3 days, and 7 days, proliferation of the cells on the membranes was determined. Evaluation of the biodegradation pattern was performed in a dog model with simultaneous bone augmentation with Bio-Oss (Geistlich Biomaterials) or Cerabone (Botiss Biomaterials) in the lateral anterior maxilla in eight animals with histologic examination after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.\nAn interconnective pore system was identifiable for Remotis, while Bio-Gide displayed a more fibrous structure. In vitro, Remotis showed considerable cell proliferation, which was significantly superior to that observed with Bio-Gide, especially after 7 days (2,910 \u00b1 1,273 and 707 \u00b1 706, respectively). In vivo, both membranes integrated into the surrounding tissue without any inflammatory reaction. Both membranes allowed early vascularization. However, considerable biodegradation was noted within 4 to 8 weeks with Bio-Gide, while Remotis resorbed generally within the first 8 to 12 week. Both membranes supported underlying bone formation.\nBoth examined membranes indicate a high level of biocompatibility. Both are resorbed without inflammation within 8 weeks (Bio-Gide) or 12 weeks (Remotis).

Here, we investigated the effect of UCP gene transfer on therapeutic angiogenesis. Adenovirus-encoded UCP (Ad-F-UCP) increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in cells and mice. Conditioned media from UCP-overexpressing cells promoted proliferation, tubule formation, and invasion of human umbilical-vascular-endothelial cells (HUVECs), and vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Ad-F-UCP increased the vessel density in the Martigel plug assay, and generated copious vessel-like structures in the explanted muscle. The UCP effect on angiogenesis was dependent on VEGF and FGF-2. In mouse hindlimb ischemia model (N = 30/group), autoamputation (limb loss) occurred in 87% and 68% of the mice with saline and Ad encoding \u03b2-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ), respectively, whereas only 23% of the mice injected with Ad-F-UCP showed autoamputation after 21 days of treatment. Ad-F-UCP increased protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), smooth muscle cell actin (SMA) in the ischemic muscle, and augmented blood vessels doubly positive for PECAM-1 and SMA.

Using a subcutaneous implantation model in Wistar rats for up to 30 days, tissue reactions, including the induction of multinucleated giant cells and the extent of implantation bed vascularization, were assessed using histological and histomorphometrical analyses. The results showed that the chemical composition of the bone substitute material significantly influenced the cellular response.

Furthermore, the vascularization of the implantation bed of TCP was significantly higher than that of HA implantation beds. The biphasic bone substitute group combined the properties of both groups. Within the first 15 days, high giant cell formation and vascularization rates were observed, which were comparable to the TCP-group. However, after 15 days, the tissue reaction, i.e. the extent of multinucleated giant cell formation and vascularization, was comparable to the HA-group.

This technique allows tailor-made reconstruction and shifting from the traditional two-stage procedure to a one-stage technique. Cadaveric studies have described the number, location, and size of facial artery perforators. Understanding of the facial artery blood supply can be complete, however, only if the cutaneous supply of each perforator is known.\nThe authors performed 20 dissections of facial arteries on fresh cadavers. All facial artery perforators greater than 0.5 mm were dissected and the diameters measured. All perforators were selectively injected with 1 ml of diluted ink solution. All these results were statistically analyzed.\nTwenty facial arteries were dissected, with a mean length of 12.06 cm. The average number of perforators greater than 0.5 mm per facial artery was 5.05. The mean diameter of the perforators was 0.96 mm. A total of 101 perforators were selectively injected, and the mean size of all injected skin areas was 8.05 cm. Seven main, reliable types of perforator territory were identified.\nFacial artery perforators seem to be predominantly between 1 and 2 cm lateral to the level of the oral commissure. Seven main types of perforasomes have been identified and appear to be the basis for local flap design.

Abrogation of the immunogenicity of the skin component of a face or hand allograft may decrease alloreactivity and permit the induction of immunologic tolerance. Proof-of-principle demonstrations of transduction of composite tissue have been established using adenoviral vectors, producing transient gene expression. The authors hypothesized that transduction, integration, and long-term expression of transgenes in a vascularized composite allograft could be achieved using lentiviral vectors.\nEx vivo transduction of heterogeneous primary rat cell lines representative of a composite tissue flap's cellular architecture was performed using a luc-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) human immunodeficiency virus-1-based lentiviral vector. Ex vivo injections of rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps with the viral vector were performed intraarterially, intramuscularly, and intradermally.\nQuantifiable reporter expression by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis and in vitro bioluminescence was observed. The luc-eGFP vector exhibited broad tropism and allowed transgene expression in relevant cell lines and throughout the flaps. Ex vivo intradermal transfection resulted in genomic integration and long-term constitutive gene expression (>150 days). Similarly, efficient intradermal transfection of face and hand flaps in a rat model corroborated this approach. Ex vivo intravascular perfusion of the vector proved inferior to intradermal injection.\nIntradermal delivery of the transgenes proved superior to intravascular perfusion. Optimization of this gene-delivery approach may allow long-term, constitutive expression of immunomodulatory proteins in face and hand allografts.

{"title": "The role of the internal mammary vessels as recipient vessels in secondary and tertiary head and neck reconstruction.", "abstract": "Successful microsurgical free tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction highly depends on the quality of the recipient vessels. In most cases, vessels near the site of resection are available; however, when the bilateral vascular network in the neck is compromised or inaccessible due to prior surgery and/or irradiation, alternatives have to be sought.\nSecondary or tertiary head and neck reconstruction was performed using the internal mammary vessels (IMVs) as recipient vessels in seven patients who had undergone previous neck dissection and radiation therapy. Indications were: tracheal-oesophageal fistula or stenosis (n = 4), oesophageal-cutaneous fistula (n = 1), saliva fistula (n = 1) and oral cancer (n = 1). Free flaps used for reconstruction were radial forearm flap (FRFF) (n = 5), anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) (n = 3) and transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM) (n = 1). Within two patients an additional ALT flap was necessary for soft-tissue coverage and resurfacing of the neck. The IMVs were separately exposed in a standard fashion over the second or third rib. The pedicle of the flap was anastomosed anterograde and end-to-end to the recipient vessels in all cases. Mean pedicle length was 14.3 cm (11-20 cm), with a mean distance of 9.8 cm (7-13 cm) between the resection and recipient vessel site.\nAll patients were tumour free at time of re-operation and no sign of radiation injury was observed in the recipient vessels. All flaps survived and all patients healed without major complications. Mean follow-up time was 18 months. Four patients died of local recurrence or distant metastases during follow-up.\nIn the vessel-depleted neck, the IMVs are a reliable and easy accessible recipient area for microsurgical reconstruction of the head and neck. Surgical management and technique refinements for dissection of the vessels are discussed. In combination with free flaps with a long pedicle, especially perforator flaps, vein grafts are unnecessary and microsurgery can safely be performed outside the zone of injury.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2012-01-31", "authors": ["N ARoche", "PHoutmeyers", "H FVermeersch", "F BStillaert", "Ph NBlondeel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2012.01.006"}

In this study, we investigated the application of therapeutic ultrasound methods available in the clinic to increase nanotherapeutic particle accumulation in epithelial and EMT tumors by labeling particles with a positron emission tomography tracer. Epithelial tumors were highly vascularized with tight cell-cell junctions, compared with EMT tumors where cells displayed an irregular, elongated shape with loosened cell-cell adhesions and a reduction in E-cadherin and cytokeratins 8/18 and 19. Without ultrasound, the accumulation of liposomal nanoparticles administered to tumors in vivo was approximately 1.5 times greater in epithelial tumors than EMT tumors. When ultrasound was applied, both nanoaccumulation and apparent tumor permeability were increased in both settings. Notably, ultrasound effects differed with thermal and mechanical indices, such that increasing the thermal ultrasound dose increased nanoaccumulation in EMT tumors.

Interestingly, the formation of vertical branches was also guided by filopodia-extending ECs located at the tip of branches, consistent with tip cells, which emerged from established vessels to form a secondary plexus within the deeper neuronal cell layers. During both phases of vascular patterning, Dll1 was not expressed in ECs but in the superficial neuronal layer in close contact with expanding vessels, where Dll1 expression coincided with tip cell formation in a spatiotemporal manner. In vitro, culture of ECs on DLL1 induced essential tip cell genes, including Dll4, VEGF receptor 3, and ephrin-B2, and stimulated VEGF responsiveness and vascular network formation.\nDll1 acts as an extrinsic cue involved in tip cell selection, which directs vessel sprouting and branch formation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2012-01-28", "authors": ["L CNapp", "MAugustynik", "FPaesler", "KKrishnasamy", "JWoiterski", "ALimbourg", "JBauersachs", "HDrexler", "FLe Noble", "F PLimbourg"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.263319"}
{"title": "In vitro differentiation of human skin-derived multipotent stromal cells into putative endothelial-like cells.", "abstract": "Multipotent stem cells have been successfully isolated from various tissues and are currently utilized for tissue-engineering and cell-based therapies. Among the many sources, skin has recently emerged as an attractive source for multipotent cells because of its abundance. Recent literature showed that skin stromal cells (SSCs) possess mesoderm lineage differentiation potential; however, the endothelial differentiation and angiogenic potential of SSC remains elusive. In our study, SSCs were isolated from human neonatal foreskin (hNFSSCs) and adult dermal skin (hADSSCs) using explants cultures and were compared with bone marrow (hMSC-TERT) and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) for their potential differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells.\nConcordant with previous studies, both MSCs and SSCs showed similar morphology, surface protein expression, and were able to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. Using an endothelial induction culture system combined with an in vitro matrigel angiogenesis assay, hNFSSCs and hADSSCs exhibited the highest tube-forming capability, which was similar to those formed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with hNFSSCs forming the most tightly packed, longest, and largest diameter tubules among the three cell types. CD146 was highly expressed on hNFSSCs and HUVEC followed by hADSSCs, and hMSC-TERT, while its expression was almost absent on hADMSCs. Similarly, higher vascular density (based on the expression of CD31, CD34, vWF, CD146 and SMA) was observed in neonatal skin, followed by adult dermal skin and adipose tissue. Thus, our preliminary data indicated a plausible relationship between vascular densities, and the expression of CD146 on multipotent cells derived from those tissues.\nOur data is the first to demonstrate that human dermal skin stromal cells can be differentiated into endothelial lineage. Hence, SSCs represents a novel source of stem/stromal cells for tissue regeneration and the vascularization of engineered tissues. Moreover, the CD146 investigations suggested that the microenvironmental niche might contribute to direct stromal cells multipotency toward certain lineages, which warrants further investigation.", "journal": "BMC developmental biology", "date": "2012-01-28", "authors": ["RadhakrishnanVishnubalaji", "MuthuranganManikandan", "MayAl-Nbaheen", "BalamuthuKadalmani", "AbdullahAldahmash", "Nehad MAlajez"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-213X-12-7\n10.1073/pnas.1000256107\n10.1186/1741-7015-7-29\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1535\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0342\n10.1007/978-1-60761-999-4_8\n10.1074/jbc.M109.086389\n10.1080/14653240600735933\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.03.009\n10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.003\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.135\n10.1038/nm0603-685\n10.1146/annurev.ph.49.030187.002321\n10.1038/nm0195-27\n10.3109/14653249.2010.549122\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.02.070\n10.1007/s11010-009-0374-0\n10.1093/bmb/ldr017\n10.1038/jid.2011.64\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016114\n10.1111/j.1742-481X.2007.00408.x\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0226\n10.1089/ten.2006.0278\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2007.00237.x\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0125\n10.1186/1471-2121-11-46\n10.1111/j.1600-0625.2008.00724.x\n10.1096/fj.06-5880com\n10.1089/scd.2005.14.337\n10.1002/jcp.20584\n10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05298.x\n10.1038/sj.ki.5002312\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.01.021\n10.1186/scrt2\n10.1051/medsci/2011273269\n10.1002/dvdy.20020\n10.1042/CBI20100718\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.024\n10.1159/000273474\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-377\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.005\n10.1042/BC20100117\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.059\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1089/scd.2008.0117\n10.1182/blood-2010-08-304287\n10.1002/jcp.20636\n10.1038/nbt0602-592\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262"}

The goal of exchange transfusion therapy is to ameliorate vasoocclusion and improve tissue perfusion by removing sickled red blood cells and introducing normal red blood cells. Using computer-assisted intravital microscopy, pretransfusion and posttransfusion microvascular characteristics were analyzed. In this study, the bulbar conjunctiva exhibited a \"blanched\" avascular appearance in all 6 pediatric sickle cell anemia patients before transfusion, indicative of tissue hypoperfusion and ischemia. Immediately after transfusion, substantial improvement in vascularization and tissue perfusion resulted, reflected by the enhanced appearance of capillaries and arterioles. In addition, a decrease in red cell velocity was observed. These observations provide evidence that exchange transfusion therapy is beneficial in ameliorating vasoocclusion and improving tissue perfusion. However, with the paradoxical posttransfusion decrease in red cell velocity presumably due to induced hyperviscosity from the large transfusion volume, blood flow is still impaired. This decreased velocity may thwart efforts to improve oxygen delivery through transfusion and may, to some extent, promote vasoocclusion instead.

Symptoms may vary from simple vertebral pain, sometimes resistant to conservative medical treatment, to progressive neurological deficit. Surgery or radiotherapy have been the treatment of choice for several years, but they were worsened by intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhagic complications related to the rich vascularization that characterize these kinds of lesions, often preceded by a preoperative embolization in the acute setting. Recently, a percutaneous, minimally invasive technique of vertebroplasty has been introduced into clinical practice as an alternative to traditional surgical and radiotherapy treatment of symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas with or without features of aggressiveness at imaging studies.\nThis study aimed to illustrate the validity of treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas (VHs).\nPVP in 26 patients with symptomatic VHs and its clinical effects were evaluated in 3-24 months follow-up.\nAn inteventional pain management practice, a medical center, major metropolitan city, China.\nTwenty-six consecutive patients were treated with PVP; a total of 28 vertebral bodies. All patients were followed-up for 3-24 months, average 8.6 months. The clinical effects were evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS) and 36-item short-form (SF-36) at preoperative and postoperative and final follow-up, comparing imaging before and post-treatment.\nTwenty-six patients (28 vertebral bodies) were treated successfully with a satisfying resolution of painful symptoms within 24 to 72 hours. Cement distribution was always diffuse and homogeneous. We found paravertebral cement leakage in 3 cases without any onset of radicular symptoms related to epidural diffusion. Spinal canal and intervertebral foramen cement leakage wasn't noticed. No pulmonary embolism ever occurred and no clinical and symptomatic complications were observed. Hemangioma was confirmed by pathology examination. VAS scores decreased from 7.5 \u00b1 1.5 preoperatively to 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 postoperatively, with a final score of 0.7 \u00b1 0.5.

To understand hemodynamics in the three-dimensional vascular network of the cerebral cortex, we applied two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy to measure the motion of red blood cells (RBCs) in individual microvessels throughout the vascular hierarchy in anesthetized mice. To resolve heartbeat- and respiration-dependent flow dynamics, we simultaneously recorded the electrocardiogram and respiratory waveform. We found that centerline RBC speed decreased with decreasing vessel diameter in arterioles, slowed further through the capillary bed, and then increased with increasing vessel diameter in venules. RBC flow was pulsatile in nearly all cortical vessels, including capillaries and venules. Heartbeat-induced speed modulation decreased through the vascular network, while the delay between heartbeat and the time of maximum speed increased. Capillary tube hematocrit was 0.21 and did not vary with centerline RBC speed or topological position. Spatial RBC flow profiles in surface vessels were blunted compared with a parabola and could be measured at vascular junctions. Finally, we observed a transient decrease in RBC speed in surface vessels before inspiration. In conclusion, we developed an approach to study detailed characteristics of RBC flow in the three-dimensional cortical vasculature, including quantification of fluctuations in centerline RBC speed due to cardiac and respiratory rhythms and flow profile measurements.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a major proangiogenic inducer inhibited by the interaction with the soluble pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin 3 (PTX3). PTX3 is locally coexpressed with its ligand tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), a secreted glycoprotein that cooperates with PTX3 in extracellular matrix assembly. Here, we characterized the effect of TSG-6 on PTX3/FGF2 interaction and FGF2-mediated angiogenesis.\nSolid phase binding and surface plasmon resonance assays show that TSG-6 and FGF2 bind the PTX3 N-terminal domain with similar affinity. Accordingly, TSG-6 prevents FGF2/PTX3 interaction and suppresses the inhibition exerted by PTX3 on heparan sulfate proteoglycan/FGF2/FGF receptor complex formation and on FGF2-dependent angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Also, endogenous PTX3 exerts an inhibitory effect on vascularization induced by FGF2 in a murine subcutaneous Matrigel plug assay, the inhibition being abolished in Ptx3-null mice or by TSG-6 treatment in wild-type animals.\nTSG-6 reverts the inhibitory effects exerted by PTX3 on FGF2-mediated angiogenesis through competition of FGF2/PTX3 interaction. This may provide a novel mechanism to control angiogenesis in those pathological settings characterized by the coexpression of TSG-6 and PTX3, in which the relative levels of these proteins may fine-tune the angiogenic activity of FGF2.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2012-01-24", "authors": ["DariaLeali", "AntonioInforzato", "RobertoRonca", "RobertaBianchi", "MirellaBelleri", "DanielaColtrini", "EmanuelaDi Salle", "MarinaSironi", "Giuseppe DaniloNorata", "BarbaraBottazzi", "CeciliaGarlanda", "Anthony JDay", "MarcoPresta"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.243998"}

However, the role of Leydig cells (LCs) as a niche component is not yet clearly elucidated. Recent studies showed that peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) present a peculiar LC cytoarchitecture in which these cells are located around the seminiferous tubule lobes, making the peccary a unique model for investigating the SSC niche. This peculiarity allowed us to subdivide the seminiferous tubule cross-sections in three different testis parenchyma regions (tubule-tubule, tubule-interstitium, and tubule-LC contact). Our aims were to characterize the different spermatogonial cell types and to determine the location and/or distribution of the SSCs along the seminiferous tubules. Compared to differentiating spermatogonia, undifferentiated spermatogonia (A(und)) presented a noticeably higher nuclear volume (P < 0.05), allowing an accurate evaluation of their distribution. Immunostaining analysis demonstrated that approximately 93% of A(und) were GDNF receptor alpha 1 positive (GFRA1(+)), and these cells were preferentially located adjacent to the interstitial compartment without LCs (P < 0.05). The expression of colony-stimulating factor 1 was observed in LCs and peritubular myoid cells (PMCs), whereas its receptor was present in LCs and in GFRA1(+) A(und).

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced skin carcinogenesis depends on recruitment and alternative activation of macrophages.", "abstract": "Inflammation contributes to tumour growth, invasion and angiogenesis. We investigated the contribution of macrophages and their polarization to tumour progression in a model of VEGF-A-induced skin carcinogenesis. Transfection of the human non-tumourigenic keratinocyte cell line HaCaT with murine VEGF-A leads to malignant tumour growth in vivo. The resulting tumours are characterized by extensive vascularization, invasive growth and high numbers of M2-polarized macrophages that crucially contribute to the establishment of the malignant phenotype. Accordingly, macrophage depletion from tumour-bearing animals resulted in reduced tumour growth, inhibition of invasion, decreased proliferation and reduced angiogenesis. In vitro, VEGF-A exerted a chemo-attracting effect on macrophages, but did not induce M2 polarization. We identified IL-4 and IL-10 as the factors involved in M2 polarization. These factors were produced by tumour cells (IL-10) and macrophages (IL-4) in vivo. Addition of recombinant IL-4 and IL-10 in vitro induced a pro-invasive M2 macrophage phenotype and inhibition of the IL-4 receptor in vivo blocked M2 polarization of macrophages, resulting in a less aggressive tumour phenotype. Thus, we provide evidence that M2 macrophages are crucial for the development of VEGF-A-induced skin tumours and that VEGF-A contributes to malignant tumour growth, not only by enhancing angiogenesis but also by establishing an anti-inflammatory microenvironment. However, VEGF-A alone is not sufficient to create a tumour-promoting microenvironment and requires the presence of IL-4 and IL-10 to induce M2 polarization of macrophages.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2012-01-21", "authors": ["NinaLinde", "WiltrudLederle", "SofiaDepner", "Nicovan Rooijen", "Claudia MGutschalk", "Margareta MMueller"], "doi": "10.1002/path.3989"}
{"title": "Congruence of vascular network remodeling and neuronal dispersion in the hippocampus of reelin-deficient mice.", "abstract": "In the hippocampus, neurons and fiber projections are strictly organized in layers and supplied with oxygen via a vascular network that also develops layer-specific characteristics in wild-type mice, as shown in the present study for the first time in a quantitative manner. By contrast, in the reeler mutant, well known for its neuronal migration defects due to the lack of the extracellular matrix protein reelin, emerging layer-specific characteristics of the vascular pattern were found to be remodeled during development of the dentate gyrus. Remarkably, in the first postnatal week, when a granule cell layer was still discernable in the reeler dentate gyrus, also the reeler vascular pattern resembled wild type. Thus, at postnatal day 6, unbranched microvessels traversed the granule cell layer and bifurcated when reaching the subgranular zone. Only after the first postnatal week vascular network remodeling in the reeler dentate gyrus became apparent, when the proportion of dispersed granule cells increased. Hence, vessel bifurcation frequency decreased in the maturing reeler dentate gyrus, but increased in wild type, resulting in significant differences (approx. 100%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) between adult wild type and reeler.

The negative pressure environment created in the pleural space can complicate management and result in dural-plural fistula formation. We report on the use of a vascularized omental flap to treat this complication after failure of more traditional techniques.\nA 76-year-old man presented with complaints of myeloradiculopathy, including weakness of lower extremities, with gait and bowel and bladder dysfunction after 2 previous decompressions at the T6-T7 level.

We identified seven published studies.\nThe ACL remnant might accelerate the vascularization and the ligamentization of the graft and contribute to faster graft innervation leading to a better proprioception.\nThe role of the ACL remnant is debated, because, although it may increase the risk of impingement and the formation of cyclops lesion, its preservation can improve proprioception, biomechanical functions and vascularity. However, the current assessment methods to assess proprioception, vascularization and the ligamentization do not lead to hard evidence that preservation of the remnant confers clinically relevant advantages over its excision.\nThe ACL remnant has been demonstrated in experimental studies to have a role in improving revascularization, ligamentization and reinnervation of the graft, but these findings are still not supported by clinical findings.

This is due to the ability of Doppler US (DUS) to detect pathological vascularization within joints and periarticular soft tissues, thereby demonstrating the presence of active inflammation, which has been reported to be correlated with the local neo-angiogenesis. In synovitis, DUS showed a high correlation with histological and MRI findings, thus it is considered a valid tool to detect pathological synovial vascularization. Moreover, it is more sensitive than clinical examination in detecting active joint inflammation and in the evaluation of response to treatment. In addition, DUS may be considered as a reference imaging modality in the assessment of enthesitis, MRI being not sensitive and histology not feasible. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to be able to detect changes in asymptomatic enthesis. In conclusion, DUS is a useful and sensitive tool in the evaluation and monitoring of active inflammation.

This study examined chemical-mediated differentiation of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) into endothelial cells and verified the function of AFSC-derived endothelial cells (AFSC-EC). AFSC were isolated from amniotic fluid obtained from second trimester amnioreduction as part of therapeutic intervention from pregnancies affected with twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Undifferentiated AFSC were of normal karyotype with a subpopulation of cells positive for the embryonic stem cell marker SSEA4, hematopoietic stem cell marker c-kit, and mesenchymal stem cell markers CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105. Additionally, these cells were negative for the endothelial marker CD31 and hematopoietic differentiation marker CD45. AFSC were cultured in endothelial growth media with concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ranging from 1 to 100 ng/mL. After 2 weeks, AFSC-EC expressed von Willebrand factor, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, CD31, VE-cadherin, and VEGF receptor 2. Additionally, the percentage of cells expressing CD31 was positively correlated with VEGF concentration up to 50\u2009ng/mL, with no increase at higher concentrations. AFSC-EC showed a decrease in stem cells markers c-kit and SSEA4 and were morphologically similar to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In functional assays, AFSC-EC formed networks and metabolized acetylated low-density lipoprotein, also characteristic of HUVEC. Nitrate levels for AFSC-EC, an indirect measure of nitric oxide synthesis, were significantly higher than undifferentiated controls and significantly lower than HUVEC.

Three-dimensional-derived nomograms seem reliable for the prediction of both normal and pathological pulmonary volumes. MRI is attracting increasing attention. The studies recently published on this method are highly heterogeneous; universally accepted standardized values for the prediction of pulmonary hypoplasia are, hence, not available.

It was found in a single locality within the Tendaguru Formation of southeastern Tanzania, possibly representing a single herd. Dysalotosaurus provides an excellent case study for examining variation in bone microstructure and life history and helps to unravel the still mysterious growth pattern of small ornithopods.\nFive different skeletal elements were sampled, revealing microstructural variation between individuals, skeletal elements, cross sectional units, and ontogenetic stages. The bone wall consists of fibrolamellar bone with strong variability in vascularization and development of growth cycles. Larger bones with a high degree of utilization have high relative growth rates and seldom annuli/LAGs, whereas small and less intensively used bones have lower growth rates and a higher number of these resting lines. Due to the scarcity of annuli/LAGs, the reconstruction of the life history of Dysalotosaurus was carried out using regularly developed and alternating slow and fast growing zones. Dysalotosaurus was a precocial dinosaur, which experienced sexual maturity at ten years, had an indeterminate growth pattern, and maximum growth rates comparable to a large kangaroo.\nThe variation in the bone histology of Dysalotosaurus demonstrates the influence of size, utilization, and shape of bones on relative growth rates. Annuli/LAGs are not the only type of annual growth cycles that can be used to reconstruct the life history of fossil vertebrates, but the degree of development of these lines may be of importance for the reconstruction of paleobehavior. The regular development of annuli/LAGs in subadults and adults of large ornithopods therefore reflects higher seasonal stress due to higher food demands, migration, and altricial breeding behavior.

Mega-prosthesis is clearly a useful reconstructive tool. Because the survival time of tumor patients has been increasing due to better treatment options, the aim of our group is to achieve complete biological reconstruction without using any artificial materials. With this approach, durability would not be a limitation. In the present study, we reviewed the biological reconstructive procedures currently available for large bone defects after tumor excision. Devitalized bone autograft is particularly well suited in the region where allografts are not readily available. However, the complication rate, such as infection and spontaneous bone resorption, was unexpectedly high due to non-viable graft. In an attempt to reduce these complications, we have used irradiated bone autograft in combination with free vascularized viable bone graft. In an experimental study, we demonstrated a neo-vascularization effect of vascularized bone graft with devitalized bone autograft, i.e. to convert dead bone into living bone. Clinically, this technique is best indicated for reconstruction of intercalary bone defect, especially tibial shaft. Some degree of articular change occurs after irradiation and cannot be prevented, even with the combined use of vascularized bone graft. In our experience, secondary procedures such as surface replacement prosthesis are necessary to treat the osteoarthritis in such cases, even if the radiological finding is severe.

PDCS 1 meant absence of vascularity, PCDS 2 represented minimal vascularity, PDCS 3 rather strong vascularity and PDCS 4 very strong vascularity. The correlation between the PDCS and successful expectant management of miscarriage was analysed. The volume of RPC was calculated using the ellipsoid formula and then compared with both the PDCS and the outcome of expectant management. Successful expectant management was defined as the resolution of symptoms and the absence of RPC on follow-up TVS.\nA total of 1395 consecutive pregnant women underwent TVS. Of them, 198 women were diagnosed with an incomplete miscarriage; 172 were managed expectantly. Complete data were available on 158 cases. In total 84.8% (134/158) were managed successfully whilst 15.2% (24/158) failed expectant management. Of the total, 89% (121/136) of women with a PDCS 1 had successful expectant management compared with 57.1 (8/14) with PDCS 2 and 62.5% (5/8) with PDCS 3. Comparing absence of flow (PDCS 1) to presence of flow (PDCS 2 or more), the rate of success was significantly higher in the first group (89 versus 60.9%, Fisher's exact test P= 0.00136). In the prediction of success, the absence of flow showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and positive likelihood ratio of 90.3, 37.5, 89, 40.9% and 1.445 (95% confidence interval: 1.055-1.979), respectively. There was no correlation between the volume of RPC and the PDCS; and there was no relationship between the volume of RPC and the success of expectant management.\nPDCS can predict the likelihood of successful expectant management of incomplete miscarriage. The absence of flow on power Doppler is associated with a significant improvement in the rate of successful expectant management. This new approach may be helpful in quantifying the chances of successful expectant management in those women with an incomplete miscarriage at the primary scan.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2012-01-11", "authors": ["IshwariCasikar", "ChuanLu", "JenniferOates", "TommasoBignardi", "DalyaAlhamdan", "GeorgeCondous"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/der433"}

Because physical requirements for MNPs differ between these two applications we have explored whether the use of different MNPs can provide site-specific positioning combined with efficient viral transduction of endothelial cells (ECs).\nA variety of MNPs was screened for magnetic cell labeling and lentivirus binding. Then two different MNPs were chosen and their combined application was evaluated regarding EC magnetization and transduction efficiency.\nThe combined use of PEI-Mag2 and NDT-Mag1 particles provided both efficient lentiviral transduction and high magnetic responsiveness of ECs that could be even retained within the vascular wall under flow conditions. The use of these MNPs did not affect biological characteristics of ECs like surface marker expression and vascular network formation. Importantly, with this method we could achieve an efficient functional overexpression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in ECs.\nThe application of two different MNPs provides optimal results for magnetic labeling of ECs in combination with viral transduction.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor involved. However, VEGF is also required for normal retinal vascular development, which raises concerns about inhibiting its activity to treat IVNV in retinopathy of prematurity. Therefore, understanding the effects that VEGF has on other factors in the development of avascular retina is important to prevent aberrant angiogenesis and IVNV. Here, we show that STAT3 was activated by increased retinal VEGF in the rat 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Phospho-STAT3 colocalized with glutamine synthetase-labeled M\u00fcller cells. Inhibition of STAT3 reduced avascular retina and increased retinal erythropoietin (Epo) expression. Epo administered exogenously also reduced avascular retina in the model. In an in vitro study, hypoxia-induced VEGF inhibited Epo gene expression by STAT3 activation in rat M\u00fcller cells. The mechanism by which activated STAT3 regulated Epo was by inhibition of Epo promoter activity. Together, these findings show that increased retinal VEGF contributes to avascular retina by regulating retinal Epo expression through Janus kinase/STAT signaling. Our results suggest that rescuing Epo expression in the retina before the development of IVNV may promote normal developmental angiogenesis and, therefore, reduce the stimulus for later pathologic IVNV.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2012-01-11", "authors": ["HaiboWang", "GraceByfield", "YanchaoJiang", "George WesleySmith", "ManabuMcCloskey", "M ElizabethHartnett"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.11.031"}

Mutations in the gene encoding PDGF-C have been linked to clefts of the lip and/or palate in humans, and ablation of PDGF-C in 129/Sv background mice results in death during the perinatal period. In this study, we report that ablation of PDGF-C in C57BL/6 mice results in a milder phenotype than in 129/Sv mice, and we present a phenotypic characterization of PDGF-C deficiency in the adult murine CNS. Multiple congenital defects were observed in the CNS of PDGF-C-null C57BL/6 mice, including cerebral vascular abnormalities with abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell coverage. In vivo imaging of mice deficient in PDGF-C also revealed cerebral ventricular abnormalities, such as asymmetry of the lateral ventricles and hypoplasia of the septum, reminiscent of cavum septum pellucidum in humans. We further noted that PDGF-C-deficient mice displayed a distorted ependymal lining of the lateral ventricles, and we found evidence of misplaced neurons in the ventricular lining.

The development of new blood vessels in the ovary and uterus is essential to guarantee the necessary supply of nutrients and hormones. The genetic and molecular mechanisms that control the development of capillary blood vessels in the reproductive organs are beginning to be elucidated.

MicroRNAs are indispensable for normal vascular development, but their exact role in regulating angiogenesis remains unresolved. Previously, we have observed that miR-214 is differentially expressed in compensatory arteriogenesis. Here, we investigated the potential role of miR-214 in the process of angiogenesis.\nmiR-214 is expressed in all major vascular cell types, and modulation of miR-214 levels in endothelial cells significantly affected tubular sprouting. In vivo silencing of miR-214 enhanced the formation of a perfused vascular network in implanted Matrigel plugs and retinal developmental angiogenesis in mice. miR-214 directly targets Quaking, a protein critical for vascular development. Quaking knockdown reduced pro-angiogenic growth factor expression and inhibited endothelial cell sprouting similar to miR-214 overexpression. In accordance, silencing of miR-214 increased the secretion of pro-angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, and enhanced the pro-angiogenic action of the endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium, whereas miR-214 overexpression had the opposite effect.\nHere, we report a novel role for miR-214 in regulating angiogenesis and identify Quaking as a direct target of miR-214.

In the vascularization of the central nervous system, astrocytes have been thought to sense tissue oxygen levels in hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)-dependent manner and control the vascular growth into the hypoxic area by secreting VEGF. However, recent genetic evidences demonstrate that not only astrocyte HIFs but also astrocyte VEGF expression is dispensable for developmental angiogenesis of the retina. This study demonstrates that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF-1\u03b1), a key transcription factor involved in cellular responses to hypoxia, is most abundantly expressed in the neuroretina, especially retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). A neuroretina-specific knockout of HIF-1\u03b1 (\u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox)) showed impaired vascular development characterized by decreased tip cell filopodia and reduced vessel branching. The astrocyte network was hypoplastic in \u03b1Cre(+)Hif1\u03b1(flox/flox) mice.

While morphometry has transitioned from observational grading to computational quantification, established quantitative methods eliminate information by relying on two-dimensional (2D) analysis to describe three-dimensional (3D) niches. In this study, we demonstrate the validity and utility of 3D morphological quantification using two common angiogenesis assays in our fibrin-based in vitro model: (1) the microcarrier bead assay with human mesenchymal stem cells and (2) the rat aortic ring outgrowth assay. The quantification method is based on collecting and segmenting fluorescent confocal z-stacks into 3D models with 3D Slicer, an open-source magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography analysis program. Data from 3D models are then processed into biologically relevant metrics in MATLAB for statistical analysis. Metrics include descriptive parameters such as vascular network length, volume, number of network segments, and degree of network branching. Our results indicate that 2D measures are significantly different than their 3D counterparts unless the vascular network exhibits anisotropic growth along the plane of imaging. Additionally, the statistical outcomes of 3D morphological quantification agreed with our initial qualitative observations among different test groups.

{"title": "Modeling stem/progenitor cell-induced neovascularization and oxygenation around solid implants.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering constructs and other solid implants with biomedical applications, such as drug delivery devices or bioartificial organs, need oxygen (O(2)) to function properly. To understand better the vascular integration of such devices, we recently developed a novel model sensor containing O(2)-sensitive crystals, consisting of a polymeric capsule limited by a nanoporous filter. The sensor was implanted in mice with hydrogel alone (control) or hydrogel embedded with mouse CD117/c-kit+ bone marrow progenitor cells in order to stimulate peri-implant neovascularization. The sensor provided local partial O(2) pressure (pO(2)) using noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance signal measurements. A consistently higher level of peri-implant oxygenation was observed in the cell-treatment case than in the control over a 10-week period. To provide a mechanistic explanation of these experimental observations, we present in this article a mathematical model, formulated as a system of coupled partial differential equations, that simulates peri-implant vascularization. In the control case, vascularization is considered to be the result of a foreign body reaction, while in the cell-treatment case, adipogenesis in response to paracrine stimuli produced by the stem cells is assumed to induce neovascularization. The model is validated by fitting numerical predictions of local pO(2) to measurements from the implanted sensor. The model is then used to investigate further the potential for using stem cell treatment to enhance the vascular integration of biomedical implants.

{"title": "Folic acid improves inner ear vascularization in hyperhomocysteinemic mice.", "abstract": "More than 29 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with hearing loss. Interestingly, elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are also associated with impaired hearing. However, the associated mechanism remains obscure. The collagen receptor such as discoidin domain receptor 1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a significant role in inner ear structure and function. We hypothesize that HHcy increases hearing thresholds by compromise in inner ear vasculature resulted from impaired Hcy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, collagen IVa and collagen Ia turnover. The treatment with folic acid (FA) protects elevated hearing thresholds and prevents reduction in vessel density by lowering abundant collagen deposition and oxidative stress in inner ear. To test this hypothesis we employed 8 weeks old male wild type (WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice, WT + FA (0.0057 \u03bcg/g/day, equivalent to a 400 \u03bcg/70 kg/day human dose in drinking water); and CBS(+/-) +FA. The mice were treated for four weeks. The hearing thresholds were determined by recording the auditory brainstem responses. Integrity of vessels was analyzed by perfusion of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer. Endothelial permeability was assessed, which indicated restoration of HRP leakage by FA treatment. A total Hcy level was increased in stria vascularis (SV) and spiral ligament (SL) of CBS+/- mice which was lowered by FA. Interestingly, FA treatment lowered Col IVa Immunostaining by affecting its turnover. The levels of MMP-2, -9, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione gamma lyase (CSE) were measured by Western blot analysis. The oxidative stress was high in SV and SL of CBS+/- compared to WT however the treatment with FA lowered oxidative stress in CBS+/- mice. These data suggested that hearing loss in CBS+/- mice was primarily due to leakage in inner ear circulation, also partly by induced collagen imbalance, increase in Hcy and oxidative stress in inner ear.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2012-01-10", "authors": ["SoumiKundu", "CharuMunjal", "NeetuTyagi", "UtpalSen", "Aaron CTyagi", "Suresh CTyagi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.12.006"}

Liver microvessels, termed liver sinusoids, have highly specialized structures, and recapturing these sinusoidal structures is essential for reconstruction of functional liver tissue in vitro. Liver sinusoids are composed of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). Direct HSC-EC contacts are increasingly recognized for their roles in EC capillary morphogenesis. However, the hypothetical role of HSC-EC contacts in morphogenesis remains unclear in hepatocyte-HSC-EC triculture. In the present study, we first determined the effects of direct HSC-EC contacts on EC capillary morphogenesis using a hepatocyte-HSC-EC triculture model where HSC behavior was spatially controlled to achieve HSC-mediated proximal layers of hepatocytes and ECs. EC capillary morphogenesis was induced by overlaying Matrigel on an EC layer. Direct HSC-EC contacts inhibited EC capillary morphogenesis, suggesting that the HSC-EC contacts may be an important factor in capillary formation. We next tested the hypothesis that, in addition to spatial control, temporal control of HSC behavior is also important in achieving capillary morphogenesis in the triculture. ECs responded to the induction of capillary morphogenesis before the formation of direct HSC-EC contacts, while the ECs remained to form monolayers when capillary morphogenesis was induced after the HSC-EC contacts were established. When capillary morphogenesis was successfully achieved in the triculture, HSCs tended to preferably localize near the preformed capillary-like structures, resulting in the reconstruction of liver sinusoidal structures.

Endocrine involvement in BD regarding various systems can be seen. Hypophysis is one of the best and dense vascularized organs of the body, thus it is likely that it can be affected by BD. Not only anterior hypophysis functions, but posterior hypophysis functions as well can be affected. As BD is a disease of autoimmune process, it may be possible that adrenal insufficiency or alterations in the cortisol levels could be expected. Another concern is whether or not there is insulin resistance in patients with BD.

{"title": "Temporal and spatial vascularization patterns of unions and nonunions: role of vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenetic proteins.", "abstract": "Failure of fracture-healing with nonunion is a major clinical problem. Angiogenesis is closely linked to bone regeneration, but the role of angiogenesis in nonunion formation remains unclear. Because established nonunions are well vascularized, we hypothesized that lack of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and vascularization during the early time course of fracture-healing determine nonunion formation.\nIn seventy-two CD-1 mice, a femoral osteotomy with a gap size of 1.80 mm (nonunion group) or a gap size of 0.25 mm (union group) was created and stabilized by a pin-clip technique. Healing was analyzed after three, seven, fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-eight, and seventy days by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Vascularization was determined in different healing zones by immunohistochemical staining of PECAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule). Additional animals were analyzed after seven, fourteen, and twenty-one days with Western blot analysis of VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, and BMP-4 expression.\nMicro-computed tomography and histomorphometry showed complete bone-bridging in the union group, whereas animals in the nonunion group showed atrophic nonunion formation. Vascularization increased from day 3 to day 7 in both groups, with a subsequent decrease after fourteen days. However, overall vascularization did not differ between unions and nonunions over time. It is of interest that vascularization within the endosteal healing zone was even higher in nonunions than in unions after fourteen days. Expression of VEGF was significantly higher in nonunions, while expression of BMP-2 and 4 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were found significantly reduced compared with unions.\nBecause vascularization during the early time course of fracture-healing was not impaired despite the failure of bone-healing in nonunions, we rejected our hypothesis and accepted the null hypothesis that nonunion formation is not due to failure of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Failure of fracture-healing was associated with a decreased expression of BMP-2 and 4 and a disturbed ratio of angiogenic to osteogenic growth factors, which may be responsible for nonunion.\nBecause the intrinsic angiogenic response during nonunion formation was sufficient for adequate vascularization, treatment strategies for nonunions should focus on the stimulation of osteogenesis rather than on the stimulation of angiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Using 1-cm(3) spherical sampling, the vascularization index (VI) from the most vascularized part of the ovarian stroma was calculated at two different moments of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole).

The mechanisms of these effects are largely unknown. We hypothesized that ET modulates microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in vascularization. miRNA-16 regulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. miRNA-21 targets Bcl-2. miRNA-126 functions by repressing regulators of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. We investigated whether miRNA-16, -21 and -126 are modulated in hypertension and by ET. Twelve-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs; n=14) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY; n=14) rats were assigned to 4 groups: SHRs, trained SHRs (SHR-T), Wistar Kyoto rats, and trained Wistar Kyoto rats. ET consisted of 10 weeks of swimming. ET reduced blood pressure and heart rate in SHR-Ts. ET repaired the slow-to-fast fiber type transition in soleus muscle and the capillary rarefaction in SHR-Ts. Soleus miRNA-16 and -21 levels increased in SHRs paralleled with a decrease of 48% and 25% in vascular endothelial growth factor and Bcl-2 protein levels, respectively. Hypertension increased Bad and decreased Bcl-x and endothelial NO synthase levels and lowered p-Bad(ser112):Bad ratio. ET in SHR-Ts reduced miRNA-16 and -21 levels and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor and Bcl-2 levels. ET restored soleus endothelial NO synthase levels plus proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators in SHR-Ts, indicating that the balance between angiogenic and apoptotic factors may prevent microvascular abnormalities in hypertension. miRNA-126 levels were reduced in SHRs with an increase of 51% in phosphoinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit 2 expression but normalized in SHR-Ts.

Successful treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach, immediate detection, meticulous debridement, and delivery of vascularized tissue to the infected wound bed.\nTwenty-nine years experience of a single surgeon in 415 sternal wound reconstructions is retrospectively analyzed. Flap choice was based on the amount of vascularized tissue required. Low-risk, early infections were treated with debridement and a single flap. Large, high-risk wounds were treated with multiple debridements and covered with a combination of flaps to reduce infection and eliminate dead space.\nImmediate wound closure with aggressive debridement and flap coverage in a single-stage early in the series (first 12 patients, 1980-1981) led to a mortality rate of 25% due to sepsis and cardiovascular instability. Thereafter, treatment was altered, and patient stability and wound preparation were emphasized, often requiring multiple debridements (91% of all patients). Nine percent of patients, with early low-risk infections, underwent single-stage rewiring and coverage with pectoralis or omental flaps. Coverage of multiple debrided purulent wounds was performed using pectoralis major flap (37% of total number of patients), omentum (18%), a pectoralis/omentum combination (34%), or rectus abdominis flap (2%).

A profound knowledge of the mechanisms including the elucidation of markers for angiogenic vessels is essential for the generation of new anti-angiogenic chemotherapeutic agents and the improvement of specific imaging techniques. During the last decades, numerous angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed and some of them have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical trials. However, the response to anti-angiogenic treatment is often delayed and shows high inter-individual variations. In order to improve anti-angiogenic therapy, new specific surrogate markers are necessary that allow the characterization of different angiogenic steps, especially at the early stage. In this respect, non-invasive imaging is a potent tool for characterizing the tumor vascularization and for sensitive and longitudinal treatment monitoring. In particular, new molecular imaging techniques might ultimately improve the characterization of the angiogenic tumor phenotype and stage. This review summarizes the current status of different imaging modalities e.g. MRI, CT, US, nuclear and optical imaging with respect to the imaging of tumor angiogenesis and of anti-angiogenic treatments. It also includes new approaches in molecular imaging, which give deep insight into the tumor stage and the response of tumor vessels to anti-angiogenic therapy.

{"title": "Monitoring molecular, functional and morphologic aspects of bone metastases using non-invasive imaging.", "abstract": "Bone is among the most common locations of metastasis and therefore represents an important clinical target for diagnostic follow-up in cancer patients. In the pathogenesis of bone metastases, disseminated tumor cells proliferating in bone interact with the local microenvironment stimulating or inhibiting osteoclast and osteoblast activity. Non-invasive imaging methods monitor molecular, functional and morphologic changes in both compartments of these skeletal lesions - the bone and the soft tissue tumor compartment. In the bone compartment, morphologic information on skeletal destruction is assessed by computed tomography (CT) and radiography. Pathogenic processes of osteoclast and osteoblast activity, however, can be imaged using optical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission CT (SPECT) and skeletal scintigraphy. Accordingly, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT as well as diffusion- weighted MRI and optical imaging are used to assess morphologic aspects on the macroscopic and cellular level of the soft tissue tumor compartment. Imaging methods such as PET, MR spectroscopy, dynamic contrast-enhanced techniques and vessel size imaging further elucidate on pathogenic processes in this compartment including information on metabolism and vascularization. By monitoring these aspects in bone lesions, new insights in the pathogenesis of skeletal metastases can be gained. In translation to the clinical situation, these novel methods for the monitoring of bone metastases might be applied in patients to improve follow-up of these lesions, in particular after therapeutic intervention.

After debridement, a hemipulp transplantation was performed.\nAs the diameter of perforators is similar to that of digital arteries, and perforators are capable of supplying large areas of tissue, they can be used as recipient vessels for ectopic implantation in finger salvage procedures. Another advantage of perforators as feeding vessels in ectopic implantation is the possibility of forming an ectopic chimera; the finger can be incorporated as a part of the chimeric reconstructive flap. With respect to these advantages, the perforator can be used as a feeder in an ectopic implantation of single finger.", "journal": "Eplasty", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["NarushimaMitsunaga", "YamamotoTakumi", "HaraHisako", "YamamotoYusuke", "OshimaAzusa", "KikuchiKazuki", "KatoHarunosuke", "SataKumiko", "DoiKentaro", "TodokoroTakeshi", "ArakiJun", "MiharaMakoto", "HigashinoTakuya", "IidaTakuya", "KoshimaIsao"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Nitric Oxide and the Biological Cascades Underlying Increased Neurogenesis, Enhanced Learning Ability, and Academic Ability as an Effect of Increased Bouts of Physical Activity.", "abstract": "The consummate principle underlying all physiological research is corporeal adaptation at every level of the organism observed. With respect to humans, the body learns to function based on the external stimuli from the environment, beginning in the womb, throughout the developmental stages of life. Nitric Oxide (NO) appears to be the governor of the plasticity of several systems in mammals implicit in their proper development. It is the purpose of this review to describe the physiological pathways that lead to plasticity of not only the vasculature but also of the brain and how physical activity plays a key role in those alterations by initiating the mechanism that triggers NO production. Further, this review hopes to show a connection between these changes and learning, comprising both motor learning and cognitive learning. This review will show how NO plays a significant role in vascularization and neurogenesis, necessary to enhance the mind-body connection and comprehensive physical performance and adaptation. It is our belief that this review effectively demonstrates, using a multidisciplinary approach, the causal mechanisms underlying the increases in neurogenesis as related to improved learning and academic performance as a result of adequate bouts of physical activity of a vigorous nature.", "journal": "International journal of exercise science", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Samuel JHunt", "James WNavalta"], "doi": null}
{"title": "BIOMECHANICS AND HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS IN RABBIT FLEXOR TENDONS REPAIRED USING THREE SUTURE TECHNIQUES (FOUR AND SIX STRANDS) WITH EARLY ACTIVE MOBILIZATION.", "abstract": "Analyzing suture time, biomechanics (deformity between the stumps) and the histology of three groups of tendinous surgical repair: Brazil-2 (4-strands) which the end knot (core) is located outside the tendon, Indiana (4-strands) and Tsai (6-strands) with sutures technique which the end knot (core) is inner of the tendon, associated with early active mobilization.\nThe right calcaneal tendons (plantar flexor of the hind paw) of 36 rabbits of the New Zealand breed (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were used in the analysis. This sample presents similar size to human flexor tendon that has approximately 4.5 mm (varying from 2mm). The selected sample showed the same mass (2.5 to 3kg) and were male or female adults (from 8 \u00bd months). For the flexor tendons of the hind paws, sterile and driven techniques were used in accordance to the Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (CETEA) of the University of the State of Santa Catarina (UDESC), municipality of Lages, in Brazil (protocol # 1.33.09).\nIn the biomechanical analysis (deformity) carried out between tendinous stumps, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.01). There was no statistical difference in relation to surgical time in all three suture techniques with a mean of 6.0 minutes for Tsai (6- strands), 5.7 minutes for Indiana (4-strands) and 5.6 minutes for Brazil (4-strands) (p>0.01). With the early active mobility, there was qualitative and quantitative evidence of thickening of collagen in 38.9% on the 15(th) day and in 66.7% on the 30(th) day, making the biological tissue stronger and more resistant (p=0.095).\nThis study demonstrated that there was no histological difference between the results achieved with an inside or outside end knot with respect to the repaired tendon and the number of strands did not affect healing, vascularization or sliding of the tendon in the osteofibrous tunnel, which are associated with early active mobility, with the repair techniques applied.", "journal": "Revista brasileira de ortopedia", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Ant\u00f4nio Louren\u00e7oSevero", "RodrigoArenhart", "DanielaSilveira", "Alu\u00edsio Ot\u00e1vio Vargas\u00c1vila", "Francisco Jos\u00e9Berral", "Marcelo BarretoLemos", "Paulo C\u00e9sar FaiadPiluski", "Osvandr\u00e9 Lu\u00eds CanfieldLech", "Walter YoshinoriFukushima"], "doi": "10.1016/S2255-4971(15)30351-7"}
{"title": "Adult calcaneal osteitis: incidence, etiology, diagnostics and therapy.", "abstract": "Calcaneal osteomyelitis presents a complicated situation. The specific anatomy of the os calcis and its surrounding soft tissues plays an important role in the planning and realization of the procedures needed in order to eradicate the osteomyelitic focus. The calcaneus represents a spongious bone; a fact that supports the developement of an osteomyelitis. It is the strongest bone of the foot and is highly important for the biomechanical features of physiological walking. The surrounding soft tissues are thin and contain various important anatomical structures. These might be damaged during the treatment of the osteomyelitis. In addition the vascularization of the os calcis is delicate and may be compromized during the surgical osteomyelitis treatment. Calcaneus osteomyelitis may be classified based on the routes of infection into exogenous and endogenous forms. Additionally from the clinical point of view acute and chronic forms may be distinguished from an early and a late infection. Exogenous calcaneal osteomyelitis mostly is the result of an infection with S. aureus. The treatment is equal to the therapy in other locations and based on: Eradication of the bone infectionSanitation of the soft tissue infectionReconstruction of bone and soft tissue Especially the preservation and restoration of the soft tissue is important. Thus plastic surgical procedures play an essential role. The main object of treatment is the preservation of a biomechanical functioning foot. This may be impossible due to the local situation. Calcanectomy or even below knee amputation may be needed in those cases.\nDie Fersenbeinosteitis ist eine seltene Entit\u00e4t. Sie konfrontiert den behandelnden Arzt mit einer Reihe komplizierter Probleme. Eine wesentliche Rolle spielt dabei die spezielle Anatomie des Calcaneus und seiner umgebenden Weichteile. Der Calcaneus ist beim Gehen und der daraus folgenden Last\u00fcbertragung vom K\u00f6rper biomechanisch hoch belastet. Das Fersenbein ist ein spongi\u00f6ser Knochen und bietet demnach gute Voraussetzungen f\u00fcr eine Erregerausbreitung. Der umgebende Weichteilmantel ist d\u00fcnn, enth\u00e4lt aber auf engem Raum eine gro\u00dfe Zahl wesentlicher anatomischer Strukturen. Die m\u00f6glichst ungest\u00f6rte Durchblutung des Calcaneus ist eine Voraussetzung f\u00fcr die erfolgreiche Therapie. Gerade diese wird aber bei den z.T. ausgedehnten chirurgischen Revisionsoperationen im Rahmen der Infektsanierung h\u00e4ufig kompromittiert.Unterteilt wird die Calcaneus-Osteitis in eine exogene (posttraumatische/postoperative) Form und in eine endogene (h\u00e4matogene) Form.

{"title": "Control of scar tissue formation in the cornea: strategies in clinical and corneal tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Corneal structure is highly organized and unified in architecture with structural and functional integration which mediates transparency and vision. Disease and injury are the second most common cause of blindness affecting over 10 million people worldwide. Ninety percent of blindness is permanent due to scarring and vascularization. Scarring caused via fibrotic cellular responses, heals the tissue, but fails to restore transparency. Controlling keratocyte activation and differentiation are key for the inhibition and prevention of fibrosis. Ophthalmic surgery techniques are continually developing to preserve and restore vision but corneal regression and scarring are often detrimental side effects and long term continuous follow up studies are lacking or discouraging. Appropriate corneal models may lead to a reduced need for corneal transplantation as presently there are insufficient numbers or suitable tissue to meet demand. Synthetic optical materials are under development for keratoprothesis although clinical use is limited due to implantation complications and high rejection rates. Tissue engineered corneas offer an alternative which more closely mimic the morphological, physiological and biomechanical properties of native corneas. However, replication of the native collagen fiber organization and retaining the phenotype of stromal cells which prevent scar-like tissue formation remains a challenge. Careful manipulation of culture environments are under investigation to determine a suitable environment that simulates native ECM organization and stimulates keratocyte migration and generation.", "journal": "Journal of functional biomaterials", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Samantha LWilson", "Alicia JEl Haj", "YingYang"], "doi": "10.3390/jfb3030642\n10.1098/rsif.2004.0002\n10.1126/science.286.5447.2169\n10.1167/iovs.07-1321\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.08.001\n10.1016/S1350-9462(00)00005-7\n10.1083/jcb.2.4.243\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.06.005\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.12.018\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0239\n10.1136/bjo.85.4.379\n10.1016/j.jsb.2004.08.009\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.02.002\n10.1016/j.exer.2006.03.015\n10.1016/j.exer.2003.07.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.024\n10.1088/1748-6041/2/3/S07\n10.1136/bmj.318.7187.821\n10.1097/00055735-200308000-00004\n10.1167/iovs.02-0300\n10.1111/j.1442-9071.1992.tb00718.x\n10.1016/S0161-6420(01)00694-7\n10.1167/iovs.08-3077\n10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00033-0\n10.1038/sj.eye.6701557\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.11.001\n10.1136/bjo.77.4.243\n10.1016/j.exer.2010.10.004\n10.1091/mbc.E06-10-0912\n10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01135.x\n10.1002/dvdy.21579\n10.1034/j.1600-0420.2002.800303.x\n10.1038/eye.1994.43\n10.1016/j.exer.2008.12.005\n10.1016/S0014-4835(03)00188-X\n10.1016/j.exer.2004.08.002\n10.1248/yakushi.129.1113\n10.1074/jbc.M303292200\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.005\n10.1016/j.exer.2005.09.021\n10.1002/adfm.201200655\n10.1167/iovs.11-8609\n10.1016/S1350-9462(99)00007-5\n10.1016/j.exer.2004.07.008\n10.1002/term.429\n10.1167/iovs.05-0635\n10.1016/j.jbmt.2008.03.005\n10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00017-2\n10.1083/jcb.119.3.629\n10.1242/jcs.068221\n10.2174/156652411794859241\n10.1016/j.exer.2010.05.013\n10.1083/jcb.84.3.501\n10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0650\n10.1007/s10439-007-9323-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.013\n10.1111/j.1442-9071.2010.02198.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.066\n10.1189/jlb.1102543\n10.1038/eye.2009.17\n10.1080/07853890410018826\n10.1111/j.1399-3089.2007.00432.x\n10.1038/eye.1995.49\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2006.05.015\n10.1136/bjo.79.9.825\n10.1089/107632700418038\n10.1016/S0039-6257(97)00024-6\n10.1016/j.jcrs.2003.12.026\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00370-3\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00168-5\n10.1093/toxsci/kfh270\n10.1167/iovs.06-1216\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0748\n10.1016/j.copbio.2009.09.002\n10.1167/iovs.07-1599\n10.1007/s11626-999-0062-0\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2007.08.004\n10.1002/adfm.200500042\n10.1002/jmri.20398\n10.1088/0957-4484/17/1/015\n10.3109/02713683.2010.512407\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.055\n10.1006/exer.1997.0419\n10.1016/0892-8967(95)00014-3\n10.1167/iovs.07-0587\n10.1016/0014-4835(83)90008-8\n10.1016/S0002-9394(03)00085-0\n10.1002/term.19\n10.1016/S0021-5155(98)00002-1\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021832\n10.1006/exer.1994.1152\n10.1006/exer.1994.1122\n10.1016/0892-8967(95)00015-1\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e31816bdf54"}

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of distinct resorbable ceramic carriers on bone forming capacities of VEGF transfected bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). A critical size defect of the radius in rabbits was filled either by a low surface scaffold called beta-TCP (tricalciumphsphate) or the high surface scaffold CDHA (calcium deficient hydroxy-apatite) loaded with autologous BMSC, which were either transfected with a control plasmid or a plasmid coding for phVEGF165. They were compared to unloaded scaffolds. Thus, six treatment groups (n = 6 in each group) were followed by X-ray over 16 weeks. After probe retrieval, the volume of new bone was measured by micro-CT scans and vascularization was assessed in histology. While only minor bone formation was found in both carriers when implanted alone, BMSC led to increased osteogenesis in both carriers. VEGF promoted vascularization of the scaffolds significantly in contrast to BMSC alone. Bone formation was increased in the beta-TCP group, whereas it was inhibited in the CDHA group that showed faster scaffold degradation.

{"title": "Utility of endoscopic ultrasound multimodal examination with fine needle aspiration for the diagnosis of pancreatic insulinoma - a case report.", "abstract": "Insulinomas are benign insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors originating in the pancreatic beta cells. Symptoms are caused by hypoglycemia and clinical diagnosis is based on establishing their relationship to fasting, usually via a fasting test. The most conclusive imaging tests are endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT. Surgery is the treatment of choice. A 33 year old male presented with a 2-year history of hunger which had intensified in the previous 6 months with added accompanying symptoms, culminating with an acute episode - loss of consciousness and seizures - which resolved after administering i.v. glucose. A fasting test was performed, with results suggestive for an insulinoma. Dual-phase CT showed a mass in the tail of the pancreas but no contrast enhancement. EUS was used for further assessment: B-mode showed a hypoechoic focal mass with a cystic component, on contrast enhancement the pattern was hypovascular, and elastography showed soft tissue. EUS fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed and the immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was conclusive for a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Treatment consisted of caudal pancreatectomy, with no recurrence after 1-year follow-up. Although this case started with a classic clinical presentation of an insulinoma, imaging studies related to tumor vascularization raised doubts about the actual diagnosis. Nevertheless, multimodal EUS assessment with FNA was considered to be the most appropriate diagnostic technique for detection, characterization and staging of the mass.

{"title": "Combined rib-latissimus flap; the \"picket fence\" concept for reconstruction of upper tibia defects.", "abstract": "Upper tibia defects ,type3b Gustilo, due to huge size and volume are very difficult to reconstruct; usually several operations are needed for bone and soft tissue defects and the definite one stage reconstruction is yet to be found.\nIn this article we reintroduce the rib- latissimus flap as an acceptable method to reconstruct tibia defects in selected cases.\nThe latissimus muscle with one or two ribs revascualrized by reverse flow from perforators is harvested; the ribs are bisected after harvest yielding four to six struts of vascularized bone to fill the huge upper tibia defect. Internal fixation is very important and we favor LCP plates for long bone fixation and the rib struts are fixed in place by small titanium screws to maintain the \"picket fence\" design. The muscle is then wrapped around the ribs and the defect is completely reconstructed.\nDuring the past 9 years we have used the rib-latissimus dorsi (RLD) muscle flap, without serratus muscle, in 7 patients with combined bone and soft tissue defects of the upper tibia. All the flaps healed without any major complications and only one stress fracture was seen and treated. The ribs healed and in a median of 14 months hypertrophied to the size of the upper tibia. Nonunion was not observed and patients with lower extremity defects were able to bear full weight within an average of seven months.\nThe fractures of tibia type 3a and 3b Gustilo are devastating injuries requiring several operations. Several combinations of RLD-Serratus have already been reported but a rib-LD muscle with \"picket fence\" design has not been reported .The RLD transfer with two ribs divided into four struts for bone coverage and muscle to cover all the upper tibia soft tissue defect can be a useful tool in the armamentarium of the surgeon treating combined defects in a single stage.", "journal": "Trauma monthly", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["ShahramNazerani", "Mohammad HoseinKalantar Motamedi", "Mohamad RezaEbadi", "AdelEbrahimpoor", "TaraNazerani", "BardiaBidarmaghz"], "doi": "10.5812/kowsar.22517464.3553\n10.1097/00006534-197706000-00002\n10.1080/000164701753542014\n10.1097/00006534-200101000-00053\n10.1055/s-2008-1063940\n10.1097/00006534-200005000-00062\n10.1097/00000637-198802000-00016\n10.1002/micr.10127\n10.1055/s-2007-1006419\n10.1001/archotol.1991.01870190045010\n10.1097/00006534-200206000-00021\n10.1097/00006534-199909040-00013"}
{"title": "Treatment of segmental loss of the tibia by tibialisation of the fibula: a review of the literature.", "abstract": "Segmental defects of the tibia are challenging therapeutic problems for both the physician and the patient. These defects may be caused by severe trauma, infection, tumors and congenital processes. Several different techniques have been described for treatment of these defects including the Papineau technique, allograft reconstruction, bone transport using the Ilizarov frame, free vascularized fibular graft, tibiofibular synostosis and medial transport of the fibula with Tuli's technique, use of the Ilizarov frame and Huntington's procedure. All of these techniques have their specific advantages as well as disadvantages. Some of these techniques are used rarely i.e. the Papineau technique. The procedure of choice for most large tibial defects is bone transport with Ilizarov's technique; but in some cases the tibial remnant is inadequate for lengthening and we must use alternative treatments. In the three aforementioned techniques, the fibula is transferred with peroneal and anterior tibial muscles on a pedicle of peroneal vessels. This transfer retains a biological component of vital bone that allows for a shorter time for consolidation, increased remodeling potential and resistance to infection. It also has better long-term mechanical properties. Hypertrophy of the centralized fibula is described as attaining twice its original diameter or twice the size of the contralateral tibia. Hypertrophy has been seen in nearly all cases of the fibular centralization. Maximum hypertrophy is seen in children and besides patient age, is related to bony union and weight bearing. The reported time for hypertrophy of fibula varies from one to four years. No significant change in the diameter of the fibula was observed after five years. Fracture of tibialized fibula was not reported in many studies of fibular centralization with different techniques. In the reviewed articles, there were no cases of valgus deformity of the ankle. Either the patients were satisfied with the final results despite appearance of the lower extremity and the presence of some angular deformities, although in most cases, the deformities were mild. In this review we conclude that tibialisation of the fibula in selected cases is a reasonable alternative for the treatment of massive tibial defects.", "journal": "Trauma monthly", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["AlirezaRahimnia", "FrankFitoussi", "GeorgePenne\u00e7ot", "KeywanMazda"], "doi": "10.5812/kowsar.22517464.3184\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B2.21272\n10.1302/0301-620X.90B12.21378\n10.1055/s-2007-1006751\n10.1016/j.ocl.2006.10.007\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e31817440f4\n10.1097/01.blo.0000205878.43211.44\n10.1016/j.ocl.2006.10.006"}

{"title": "Video-rate resonant scanning multiphoton microscopy: An emerging technique for intravital imaging of the tumor microenvironment.", "abstract": "The abnormal tumor microenvironment fuels tumor progression, metastasis, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. Over last several decades, developments in and applications of intravital microscopy have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. In particular, intravital multiphoton microscopy has revealed the abnormal structure and function of tumor-associated blood and lymphatic vessels, the role of aberrant tumor matrix in drug delivery, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, the dynamics of immune cell trafficking to and within tumors, and gene expression in tumors. However, traditional multiphoton microscopy suffers from inherently slow imaging rates-only a few frames per second, thus unable to capture more rapid events such as blood flow, lymphatic flow, and cell movement within vessels. Here, we report the development and implementation of a video-rate multiphoton microscope (VR-MPLSM) based on resonant galvanometer mirror scanning that is capable of recording at 30 frames per second and acquiring intravital multispectral images. We show that the design of the system can be readily implemented and is adaptable to various experimental models. As examples, we demonstrate the utility of the system to directly measure flow within tumors, capture metastatic cancer cells moving within the brain vasculature and cells in lymphatic vessels, and image acute responses to changes in a vascular network. VR-MPLSM thus has the potential to further advance intravital imaging and provide new insight into the biology of the tumor microenvironment.", "journal": "Intravital", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Nathaniel DKirkpatrick", "EuiheonChung", "Daniel CCook", "XiaoxingHan", "GabrielGruionu", "ShanLiao", "Lance LMunn", "Timothy PPadera", "DaiFukumura", "Rakesh KJain"], "doi": "10.4161/intv.21557\n10.1126/science.2321027\n10.1038/nmeth818\n10.1038/nbt899\n10.1038/427695a\n10.1200/JCO.2008.19.9356\n10.1038/89997\n10.1038/nm879\n10.1038/nm1247\n10.1046/j.1365-2818.1996.97379.x\n10.1364/OL.23.000655\n10.1046/j.1365-2818.1998.00431.x\n10.1078/0171-9335-00105\n10.1364/OL.26.000075\n10.1117/1.1580827\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.12.010\n10.1364/AO.38.006004\n10.1117/12.349216\n10.1054/ceca.2001.0246\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77396-0\n10.1126/science.1104819\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1152/physrev.00038.2010\n10.1016/0360-3016(79)90954-4\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2464\n10.1038/nrc778\n10.1038/nmeth.1475\n10.1073/pnas.1116152108\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1392\n10.1073/pnas.1016234107\n10.1038/nm.2072\n10.1101/gad.169029.111\n10.1158/2159-8274.CD-10-0028\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1823\n10.1016/S0076-6879(03)60123-0"}

{"title": "Hypoxia in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common feature in most of the solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Hypoxia reflects the imbalance between oxygen consumption by the rapidly proliferating cancer cells and the insufficient oxygen delivery due to poor vascularization and blood supply. The hypoxic microenvironment in the HNSCC contributes to the development of aggressive carcinoma phenotype with high metastatic rate, resistance to therapeutic agents, and higher tumor recurrence rates, leading to low therapeutic efficiency and poor outcome. To overcome the therapeutic resistance due to hypoxia and improving the prognosis of the HNSCC patients, many approaches have been examined in laboratory studies and clinical trials. In this short paper, we discuss the mechanisms involved in the resistance of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in hypoxic condition. We also exploit the molecular mechanisms employed by the HNSCC cells to adapt the hypoxic condition and their tumorigenic role in head and neck, as well as the strategies to overcome hypoxia-induced therapeutic resistance.", "journal": "ISRN otolaryngology", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["John ZenghongLi", "WeiGao", "Jimmy Yu-WaiChan", "Wai-KuenHo", "Thian-SzeWong"], "doi": "10.5402/2012/708974\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.07.025"}

A 9-year-old Malay girl with a history of bilateral blepharokeratoconjunctivitis was regularly treated with lid scrubbing using diluted baby shampoo, fusidic acid gel, and topical steroids as well as an intermittent course of oral doxycycline for the past year. She developed acute onset bilateral eye redness associated with poor vision in her right eye. Both eyes showed marked diffuse hyperemic conjunctiva with corneal vascularization. The presence of corneal vascularization obscured the visual axis in the right eye. The condition did not improve with regular intensive lid hygiene using diluted baby shampoo, fusidic acid gel, and topical steroids. She was started on topical cyclosporin A 0.5% every 6 hours. There was a dramatic regression of corneal vascularization after 3 days on topical cyclosporin, with marked improvement in visual acuity. This is a single case in which cyclosporin improved the status of the ocular surface.

The recent development of the super-microsurgical technique has made lymphaticovenular (LV) anastomosis an easier and more accurate surgical method for lymphedema. A summary of our experience as well as recent developments in surgical treatments for lymphedema are described.\nUltra-microstructural analysis demonstrated that dysfunction of the lymphatics in lymphedema was caused by the degeneration and incomplete regeneration of smooth muscle cells and valve insufficiency in the lymphatic channel. ICG and infrared ray examinations have been proposed as new means of assessment of lymphatic function. LV anastomosis is suitable for genital edema, arm edema with severe phlegmone with leg edema, and early stage leg edema. Although pre- and postoperative compression therapy is generally required for limb edema, some cases do not require postoperative compression due to remaining or regenerated smooth muscle cells. As new methods of treatment, the vascularized lymphadiposal flap has been effective for progressive cases with LV anastomosis. LV anastomosis is also effective for congenital chyloabdomen.

Considering that angiogenesis is a multi-step process involving humoral and cellular regulatory components, only in vivo assays provide the adequate information about vessel formation and the recruitment of endothelial cells. The present study aimed to investigate if neonatal human dermal fibroblasts could influence in vivo neovascularization. Results obtained showed that fibroblasts were able to recruit endothelial cells to vascularize the implanted matrix, which was further colonized by murine functional blood vessels after one week. The vessels exhibited higher levels of hemoglobin, compared with the control matrix, implanted without fibroblasts, in which no vessel formation could be observed. No significant differences were detected in systemic inflammation. The presence of vessels originated from the host vasculature suggested that host vascular response was involved, which constitutes a fundamental aspect in the process of neovascularization. Fibroblasts implanted within matrigel increased the presence of endothelial cells with positive staining for CD31 and for CD34 and the production of collagen influencing the angiogenic process and promoting the formation of microvessels.

With deeper understanding of the stem cell's pathobiology, the unique properties of these tissues can be effectively harnessed for the benefit of the patients. A primary source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for bone regeneration is from adipose tissue to provide adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). The interdependency between adipogenesis and osteogenesis has been well established. The objective of this article is to present the preliminary clinical observation with reconstruction of craniofacial osseous defects larger than critical size with ASC.\nPatients with large craniofacial osseous defects only were included in this study. Autogenous fat from the anterior abdominal wall of the patients was harvested from 23 patients, taken to a central tissue banking laboratory and prepared. All patients were reconstructed with ASCs, resorbable scaffolds, and growth factor as required. Vascularized soft tissue beds were prepared for ectopic bone formation and later microvascular translocation as indicated.\n23 ASC seeded resorbable scaffolds have been combined with rhBMP-2 and successfully implanted into humans to reconstruct their jaws except for three failures. The failures included one infection and two cases of inadequate bone formation.\nThe technique of ASC-aided reconstruction of large defects still remains extremely sensitive as it takes longer duration and is costlier than the conventional standard immediate reconstruction. Preliminary results and clinical observations of these cases are extremely encouraging. In future, probably with evolving technological advances, ASC-aided reconstruction will be regularly used in clinical practise.", "journal": "Annals of maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["George K BS\u00e1ndor"], "doi": "10.4103/2231-0746.95308"}

{"title": "Molecular pathways: hypoxia response in immune cells fighting or promoting cancer.", "abstract": "Both malignant and stromal components in tumors are influenced by the physiologic conditions of the microenvironment. Hypoxia is a prominent feature of solid tumors as a result of defective vascularization and intense metabolic activity. The gene-expression control mechanisms that adapt tissues to hypoxia are exploited by tumors to promote angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The functions of infiltrating immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) and other stromal components are also influenced by a limited O(2) supply. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are the main molecular transcriptional mediators in the hypoxia response. The degradation and activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are tightly controlled by the fine-tuned action of oxygen-sensing prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylase enzymes. Recent evidence indicates that hypoxia can modulate the differentiation and function of T lymphocytes and myeloid cells, skewing their cytokine-production profiles and modifying the expression of costimulatory receptors. This conceivably includes tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Hypoxia not only directly affects tumor-infiltrating leukocytes but also exerts effects on tumor cells and vascular cells that indirectly cause selective chemokine-mediated recruitment of suppressive and proangiogenic T-cell subsets. This review focuses on changes induced by hypoxia in immune cells infiltrating solid malignancies.

Images were graded independently by two observers and assessed for quality, phases of fluorescence, and leakage. Areas of CNV and vasculature geometric properties were analyzed and quantified by an automated program.\nTwenty-three patients with good quality images were included. Mean times to appearance of ICG and fluorescein were 17 and 20 seconds (P = 0.10). Best images for analysis were obtained at 64 seconds for ICGA and 47 seconds for FA. CNV not apparent on color or FA, particularly in the presence of scarring, was well delineated by ICGA. Leakage of ICGA did not occur. Fluorescein leakage from apical CNV images occurred significantly earlier (32 seconds) in patients with CNV of <6-month duration than those of >1-year (50 seconds) duration (P = 0.04). Mean area of CNV and vessel diameter were similar with ICGA (8.79 mm(2), 0.058 mm) or FA (7.74 mm(2), 0.054 mm) but significantly larger than on color (1.94 mm(2), 0.026 mm) images (P < 0.01). Vessel tortuosity was similar on ICGA (1.16), FA (1.17), and color (1.15) (P = 0.27).\nCombined use of FA and ICGA are valuable tools with which to assess CNV and provide better vessel delineation than can be obtained with only color images.

How the genetic milieu of the epithelial compartment influences tumor angiogenesis is largely unexplored. Drugs targeted to mutant cancer genes may act not only on tumor cells but also, directly or indirectly, on the surrounding stroma. We investigated the role of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene in tumor/vessel crosstalk and analyzed the effect of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on tumor angiogenesis. Knock-in of the BRAF(V600E) allele into the genome of human epithelial cells triggered their angiogenic response. In cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRAF, the inhibitor PLX4720 switches off the ERK pathway and inhibits the expression of proangiogenic molecules. In tumor xenografts harboring the BRAF(V600E), PLX4720 extensively modifies the vascular network causing abrogation of hypoxia.

{"title": "Promotion of lymphatic integrity by angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signaling during inflammation.", "abstract": "The cutaneous lymphatic system plays a major role in tissue fluid homeostasis and inflammation of the skin. Although several lymphangiogenic factors are known to be involved in the formation of lymphatic vessels, the molecular mechanisms that maintain lymphatic integrity and control the functional drainage of interstitial fluid and resolution of inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) enhances lymphatic integrity and function during inflammation. Ang1 transgenic mice under the control of keratin-14 (K14-Ang1) showed attenuated edema formation and inflammation after UV B (UVB) exposure. After UVB irradiation, blood vascular permeability was inhibited in K14-Ang1 mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, lymphatic vessels of WT mice were markedly enlarged and leaky in inflamed skin, whereas K14-Ang1 mice showed relatively contracted lymphatic vessels together with enhanced lymphatic vascularization. Expression of endothelial-specific tight junction molecules claudin-5 and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) was strongly down-regulated in the inflamed lymphatic vessels of UVB-exposed WT mice, whereas down-regulation of both claudin-5 and ZO-1 was blocked in UVB-exposed K14-Ang1 mice. In vitro studies revealed that the stability of lymphatic endothelial cells was enhanced in the presence of Ang1, presumably via up-regulation of claudin-5, as well as ZO-1. Claudin-5 knockdown markedly increased the permeability of lymphatic endothelial cells. Overall, our data strongly support the idea that Ang1/Tie2 signaling promotes lymphatic integrity by modulating tight junction molecule expression during inflammation.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2011-12-28", "authors": ["KentaroKajiya", "HiroyasuKidoya", "MikaSawane", "YuukoMatsumoto-Okazaki", "HaruyoYamanishi", "MikioFuruse", "NobuyukiTakakura"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.11.008"}
{"title": "Noninvasive detection of neural progenitor cells in living brains by MRI.", "abstract": "The presence of pericytes in brain regions undergoing repair is evident of the recruitment of bone marrow-derived multipotent regenerative cells to the neurovascular unit during angiogenesis. At present, post mortem sampling is the only way to identify them. Therefore, such cell typing is inadequate for preserving neural progenitor cells for any meaningful stem cell therapy. We aimed to target cerebral pericytes in vivo using dual gene transcript-targeted MRI (GT-tMRI) in male C57black6 mice after a 60-min bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO). We attached superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to phosphorothioate-modified micro-DNA that targets actin or nestin mRNA. Because BCAO compromises the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induces expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle (\u03b1SM)-actin and nestin antigens by pericytes in new vessels, we delivered pericyte-specific magnetic resonance contrast agents (SPION-actin or SPION-nestin at 4 mg Fe/kg) by i.p. injection to C57black6 mice that had experienced BCAO. We demonstrated that the surge in cerebral iron content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry matched the increase in the frequency of relaxivity. We also found that SPION-nestin was colocalized in \u03b1SM- actin- and nestin-expressing pericytes in BCAO-treated C57black6 or transgenic mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-mRFP1) 1F1Hadj/J, expressing red fluorescent protein by actin promoter]. We identified pericytes in the repair patch in living brains after BCAO with a voxel size of 0.03 mm(3).

The images (nine CT, 14 MRI) were reviewed, and a Bosniak cyst category was assigned.\nOf 23 confirmed cases of multilocular cystic RCC, imaging revealed seven lesions were Bosniak category IIF, 13 were category III, and three were category IV. Pathologic examination of the category IIF lesions revealed 99% fluid, 0.001-1% clear cells lining the septum, and 0% fibrosis. The category III lesions were 98-99% fluid, 1-2% clear cells, and 0% fibrosis. The category IV lesions were 20-40% fluid, 1-5% clear cells, and 60-80% fibrosis.

Clinical follow-up showed no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.\nMultilocular cystic RCC is a rare cystic lesion of the kidney that is low risk to the patient and benign in behavior. It has a variable imaging pattern, the Bosniak category ranging from IIF to IV. As multilocular cystic RCC lesions increase in complexity on images (higher Bosniak category), there is a corresponding increase in the volume of malignant cells lining the tumor and an increase in the presence of vascularized fibrous tissue.

{"title": "Generation of mice expressing only the long form of the prolactin receptor reveals that both isoforms of the receptor are required for normal ovarian function.", "abstract": "Prolactin (PRL), a pleiotropic hormone essential for maintenance of corpus luteum (CL) function and pregnancy, transduces its signal through two types of receptors, a short form (PRLR-S) and a long form (PRLR-L). Both types of receptors are expressed in the CL, yet their individual roles are not well defined. We have shown previously that female transgenic mice expressing only PRLR-S display total infertility characterized by defective follicular development and early degeneration of CL, suggesting that expression of PRLR-L is a prerequisite for normal follicular development and maintenance of CL. To determine whether PRLR-L alone is the sole receptor required to maintain normal CL formation, differentiation, and progesterone secretion, we generated two transgenic mice which express only PRLR-L, either ubiquitously (Tg-RL) or in a CL-specific manner (CL-RL). To generate CL-specific expression, we used the HSD17B7 promoter. We found both transgenic mice models cycled normally, displayed no apparent defect in follicular development, and had normal ovulation rates. The STAT5 signaling pathway, considered essential for luteinization and progesterone production, was activated by PRL in both transgenic mice models. However, soon after mating, Tg-RL and CL-RL mice showed early regression of CL, lack of progesterone production, and implantation failure that rendered them totally infertile. Embryo transfer studies demonstrated no embryo abnormalities, and supplementation with progesterone rescued implantation failure in these mice. Close observation revealed lack of luteinization and reduced expression of proteins involved in progesterone biosynthesis despite normal levels of LHCGR (LH-R), ESR1 (ER-alpha), CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) and CDKN1B (p27), proteins essential for luteinization. However, we found VEGFA, a key regulator of angiogenesis and vascularization, to be dramatically reduced in both Tg-RL and CL-RL mice. We also found collagen IV, a marker for the basal lamina of endothelial cells, aberrantly expressed and a discordant organization of endothelial cells in CL. Although luteinization did not occur in vivo, granulosa cells isolated from these mice luteinized in culture. Taken together, these results suggest that a vascularization defect in the CL may be responsible for lack of luteinization, progesterone production, and infertility in mice expressing only PRLR-L. This investigation therefore demonstrates that in contrast to earlier presumptions that PRLR-L alone is able to support normal CL formation and function, both isoforms of the PRL receptor are required in the CL for normal female fertility.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2011-12-23", "authors": ["Jamie ALe", "Heather MWilson", "AuroraShehu", "JifangMao", "Y SangeetaDevi", "JuliaHalperin", "TetleyAguilar", "AnitaSeibold", "EvelynMaizels", "GeulaGibori"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.111.095927"}

{"title": "Central role of lactic acidosis in cancer cell resistance to glucose deprivation-induced cell death.", "abstract": "Solid tumours are dependent on glucose, but are generally glucose-deprived due to poor vascularization. Nevertheless, cancer cells can generally survive glucose deprivation better than their normal counterparts. Thus, to render cancer cells sensitive to glucose depletion may potentially provide an effective strategy for cancer intervention. We propose that lactic acidosis, a tumour microenvironment factor, may allow cancer cells to develop resistance to glucose deprivation-induced death, and that disruption of lactic acidosis may resume cancer cells' sensitivity to glucose depletion. Lactic acidosis, lactosis, or acidosis was generated by adding pure lactic acid, sodium lactate, or HCl to the culture medium. Cell death, cell cycle, autophagy, apoptosis, and gene expression profiling of the surviving cancer cells under glucose deprivation with lactic acidosis were determined. Under glucose deprivation without lactic acidosis, 90% of 4T1 cancer cells died within a single day; in a sharp contrast, under lactic acidosis, 90% of 4T1 cells died in a period of 10 days, with viable cells identified even 65 days after glucose was depleted. Upon glucose restoration, surviving cells resumed proliferation. Lactic acidosis also significantly extended survival of other cancer cells under glucose deprivation. G1/G0 arrest, autophagy induction, and apoptosis inhibition were tightly associated with lactic acidosis-mediated resistance to glucose deprivation. Lactosis alone had no effect on cell survival under glucose deprivation; acidosis alone can prolong cell survival time but is not as potent as lactic acidosis. Thus, the ability of cancer cells to resist glucose deprivation-induced cell death is conferred, at least in part, by lactic acidosis, and we envision that disrupting the lactic acidosis may resume the sensitivity of cancer cells to glucose deprivation.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2011-12-23", "authors": ["HaoWu", "ZonghuiDing", "DanqingHu", "FeifeiSun", "ChunyanDai", "JianshengXie", "XunHu"], "doi": "10.1002/path.3978"}

MSCs have been isolated from many different tissue sources, but little is known about how paracrine factor secretion varies between different MSC populations. We evaluated paracrine factor expression patterns in MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (ASCs), bone marrow (BMSCs), and dermal tissues [dermal sheath cells (DSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs)]. Specifically, mRNA expression analysis identified insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) to be expressed at higher levels in ASCs compared with other MSC populations whereas VEGF-A, angiogenin, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) were expressed at comparable levels among the MSC populations examined. Analysis of conditioned media (CM) protein confirmed the comparable level of angiogenin and VEGF-A secretion in all MSC populations and showed that DSCs and DPCs produced significantly higher concentrations of leptin. Functional assays examining in vitro angiogenic paracrine activity showed that incubation of endothelial cells in ASC(CM) resulted in increased tubulogenic efficiency compared with that observed in DPC(CM). Using neutralizing antibodies we concluded that VEGF-A and VEGF-D were 2 of the major growth factors secreted by ASCs that supported endothelial tubulogenesis. The variation in paracrine factors of different MSC populations contributes to different levels of angiogenic activity and ASCs maybe preferred over other MSC populations for augmenting therapeutic approaches dependent upon angiogenesis.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2011-12-23", "authors": ["Sarah Tzu-FengHsiao", "AzarAsgari", "ZerinaLokmic", "RodneySinclair", "Gregory JamesDusting", "Shiang YongLim", "Rodney JamesDilley"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2011.0674"}

Plasma clearance was slow and elimination was biphasic with unchanged peginesatide representing >90% of the total radioactivity of the total radioactive exposure. Slow uptake of the radiolabeled compound from the vascular compartment into the tissues was observed. Biodistribution to bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoietic sites, and to highly vascularized lymphatic and excretory tissues occurred. A predominant degradation event to occur in vivo was the loss of one PEG chain from the branched PEG moiety to generate mono-PEG. Renal excretion was the primary mechanism (41%) of elimination, with parent molecule (67%) the major moiety excreted.

Stained corrosion casts of the microvasculature network guarantee superior X-ray absorption contrast and highest reproduction fidelity. Tomography of a centimeter-size tumor, however, is unfeasible at the spatial resolution needed to reveal the smallest vessels. Therefore, local tomography has been performed to visualize the smallest capillaries within the region of interest. These three-dimensional data show the detailed morphology, but the reconstructed absorption coefficients obtained in local tomography differ substantially from the absorption coefficients retrieved from the less detailed global tomography data. This paper deals with the adaptation of local tomography data using the global data and considers two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs, sinogram extension, and multi-parameter cupping correction. It is demonstrated that two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs already provides reasonable agreement. The change of the lens in front of the detector's camera, however, significantly affects the obtained local X-ray absorption coefficients in the tomograms predominantly owing to the dissimilar point-spread functions of the two configurations used, and much less to the fact that one of the data sets was acquired in a local geometry.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2011-12-22", "authors": ["SabrinaLang", "MarcoDominietto", "PhilippeCattin", "AlexandraUlmann-Schuler", "TimmWeitkamp", "BertM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1107/S0909049511046139"}

The loop was placed in a newly developed titanium chamber, which was fabricated with an electron beam melting facility, and was embedded in a hydroxyapatite/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate/fibrin matrix. At the explantation time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks), constructs were perfused by differently colored dyes to determine the amount of tissue vascularized by either the intrinsic or the extrinsic vascular pathway. Specimens were investigated by means of micro-computed tomography and histologic and morphometric analysis.\nAlthough there was an equal number of blood vessels originating from the center and the periphery, 83 percent of all vessels displayed a connection to the arteriovenous loop already at 2 weeks. There was a continuous increase of the relative proportion of vessels connected to the arteriovenous loop over time detectable. At 8 weeks, communications between the newly formed vessels and the arteriovenous loop were visible in 97 percent of all vessels.\nThis study demonstrates for the first time the enhancement of angiogenesis in an axially vascularized tissue by an additional extrinsic vascular pathway. By 2 weeks, both pathways showed connections, allowing transplantation of the entire construct using the arteriovenous loop pedicle.

Exponential decay equations describing cellular invasion through each layer were fit to each material/time point. Mean cell density and cell frequency maps were created denoting extent of invasion by location within the scaffold.\nQualitative analysis demonstrated extensive cellular infiltration into Integra by 3 days and increasing over the remaining 14 days. Invasion of Strattice was sparse, even after 14 days. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry revealed blood vessel formation within Integra by 14 days but no analogous neovascularization in Strattice.

Several studies have reported the association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) overexpression with malignancy, but none took into account the genetic status of the patients or tumors, which may have a major influence on such observations. Transcriptome studies indeed revealed that pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can be classified into two major clusters depending on their gene expression profile: Cluster 1 comprises samples associated with a hypoxic signature such as SDHx- and VHL-related tumors and cluster 2 includes RET, NF1, and TMEM127-mutated tumors, as well as most of sporadic tumors. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive rationale for the targeting of angiogenesis in patients with malignant forms of the disease. We used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and microarray gene expression profiling to evaluate angiogenesis and the expression of several angiogenic factors in a large cohort of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We also studied the activation of mTOR by assessing the phosphorylation of its targets, P70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. These results were correlated with both malignancy and transcription signature. Our results reveal that cluster 1 tumors display a marked increase in both vascularization and in the expression of major angiogenic molecules, including VEGF, its receptors, HIF2\u03b1, Angiopoietin-2, and the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB. These overexpressions were observed in both benign and malignant samples of cluster 1 and thus appeared to be mainly dependent on the pseudo-hypoxic status of these tumors. The mTOR pathway was potentially activated in half of the tumors studied, with a slight increase in cluster 2 pheochromocytomas.

However, the Gcm1 promoter lacks a Nfe2-binding site and hence the mechanisms linking Nfe2 and Gcm1 expression remained unknown. Here we show that Nfe2 represses JunD DNA-binding activity to the Gcm1 promoter during syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. Interventional studies using knockdown and knockin approaches show that enhanced JunD DNA-binding activity is required for increased expression of Gcm1 and syncytiotrophoblast formation as well as impaired placental vascularization and reduced growth of Nfe2(-/-) embryos. Induction of Gcm1 expression requires binding of JunD to the -1441 site within the Gcm1 promoter, which is distinct from the -1314 site previously shown to induce Gcm1 expression by other bZip transcription factors. Nfe2 modulates JunD binding to the Gcm1 promoter via acetylation, as reducing JunD acetylation using the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor curcumin reverses the increased JunD DNA-binding activity observed in the absence of Nfe2.

{"title": "Endocrine pancreas development: effects of metabolic and intergenerational programming caused by a protein-restricted diet.", "abstract": "Experimental studies have demonstrated an association between low birth weight and the later development of type 2 diabetes. This association could be a result of the programming process that affects pancreatic beta-cell development due to poor fetal nutrition. This mechanism may not be limited to the first generation. In rodents, endocrine cells of the pancreas are derived from cells of the endodermal dorsal and ventral anlage that migrate and gather in clusters in a process termed isletogenesis. Islet development occurs relatively late in gestation, and islets undergo substantial remodeling immediately after birth under the regulation of a transcription factor network. Furthermore, the offspring of mice fed a protein-restricted diet exhibit a reduced pancreatic beta-cell mass at birth, lower vascularization, increased apoptosis rate, and changes in glucose metabolism in later life. Although the mechanisms underlying these relationships are unclear, it has been hypothesized that in utero nutritional conditions affect epigenetic patterns of gene transcription that persist throughout life and subsequent generations.

Of these patients, 101 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study. A single surgeon performed all surgeries. A vascularized ulnar nerve graft, either pedicled or free, was used for CC7 elongation. The vascularized ulnar nerve graft was transferred to the median nerve (group 1, 1 target) in 55 patients, and to the median and musculocutaneous nerves (group 2, 2 targets) in 23 patients.

A gene-enhanced tissue engineering represents a promising approach for vascularization. Our previous study indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) can up-regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The angiogenesis is a co-ordinated process that requires the participation of multiple angiogenic factors. To further explore the angiogenic effect of HIF-1\u03b1 mediated stem cells, in this study, we systematically evaluated the function of HIF-1\u03b1 in enhancing BMSCs angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. A constitutively active form of HIF-1\u03b1 (CA5) was inserted into a lentivirus vector and transduced into BMSCs, and its effect on vascularization and vascular remodeling was further evaluated in a rat critical-sized calvarial defects model with a gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold. The expression of the key angiogenic factors including VEGF, SDF-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PLGF), angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), and stem cell factor (SCF) at both mRNAs and proteins levels in BMSCs were significantly enhanced by HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression compared to the in vitro control group. In addition, HIF-1\u03b1-over expressing BMSCs showed dramatically improved blood vessel formation in the tissue-engineered bone as analyzed by photography of specimen, micro-CT, and histology.

The relationship between PlGF-1 and conversion of the biologically inactive placental prehormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to the biologically active dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was investigated in mixed synovial cells. The effects of DHEA on PlGF-1 expression were studied by intracellular fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.\nPlGF-1-positive cells were detected in the lining and sublining areas in patients with RA and patients with OA, and cellular density was similar. Double staining revealed that PlGF-1-positive cells were macrophages. In RA and OA, the density of PlGF-1-positive cells correlated positively with the density of macrophages and the density of type IV collagen-positive vessels. The supernatant concentration of (3) H-DHEA after conversion from (3) H-DHEAS and the density of aromatase-positive cells were positively correlated with the density of PlGF-1-positive cells only in OA.

Saline, cbMSC bodies and HUVEC bodies were used as controls. In vitro results indicated that cbMSC/HUVEC bodies possessed the capability of heterotypic assembly of cbMSCs and HUVECs into robust and durable tubular networks on Matrigel. The up-regulated gene expressions of VEGF and IGF-1 reflected the robust expansion of tubular networks; in addition, the augmented levels of SMA and SM22 suggested smooth muscle differentiation of cbMSCs, possibly helping to improve the durability of networks. Moreover, according to the in vivo echocardiographic, magnetic resonance and computed-tomographic results, transplantation of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies benefited post-MI dysfunction. Furthermore, the vascularization analyses demonstrated the robust vasculogenic potential of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies in vivo, thus contributing to the greater viable myocardium and the less scar region, and ultimately restoring the cardiac function.

To model chronic recruitment of ASC by tumors, cells were injected metronomically into mice bearing Hec1a xenografts.\nO-ASC expressed cell surface markers characteristic of BM-MSC and differentiated into mesenchymal lineages. Coculture with O-ASC increased endometrial cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Tumor tropism of O-ASC and SC-ASC for human Hec1a endometrial tumor xenografts was comparable, but O-ASC more potently promoted tumor growth. Compared with tumors in SC-ASC-injected mice, tumors in O-ASC-injected mice contained higher numbers of large tortuous desmin-positive blood vessels, which correlated with decreased central tumor necrosis and increased tumor cell proliferation. O-ASC exhibited enhanced motility as compared with SC-ASC in response to Hec1a-secreted factors.\nVisceral adipose tissue contains a population of multipotent MSCs that promote endometrial tumor growth more potently than MSCs from subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Herein we investigated if a time-dependent stimulation with the separately applied proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can cause secretion of HMGB1 in a non-immune related HMGB1-non-secreting epithelial canine mammary cell line (MTH53A) derived from non-neoplastic tissue.\nThe canine cell line was transfected with recombinant HMGB1 bicistronic expression vectors and stimulated after transfection with the respective cytokine independently for 6, 24 and 48 h. HMGB1 protein detection was performed by Western blot analysis and quantified a by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Live cell laser scanning multiphoton microscopy of MTH53A cells expressing a HMGB1-GFP fusion protein was performed in order to examine, if secretion of HMGB1 under cytokine stimulating conditions is also visible by fluorescence imaging.\nThe observed HMGB1 release kinetics showed a clearly time-dependent manner with a peak release 24h after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, while stimulation with IFN-\u03b3 had only small effects on the HMGB1 release. Multiphoton HMGB1 live cell microscopy showed diffuse cell membrane structure changes 29 h after cytokine-stimulation but no clear secretion of HMGB1-GFP after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation was visible.\nOur results demonstrate that non-immune HMGB1-non-secreting cells of epithelial origin derived from mammary non-neoplastic tissue can be induced to release HMGB1 by single cytokine application. This indicates that tumor and surrounding tissue can be stimulated by tumor present inflammatory and necrotic cytokines to release HMGB1 acting as neo-vascularizing factor thus promoting tumor growth.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["SaskiaWillenbrock", "OlgaBraun", "JudithBaumgart", "SandraLange", "ChristianJunghanss", "AlexanderHeisterkamp", "IngoNolte", "J\u00f6rnBullerdiek", "HugoMurua Escobar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2011.11.011"}
{"title": "Evaluation and treatment of disorders of the infrapatellar fat pad.", "abstract": "The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP), also known as Hoffa's fat pad, is an intracapsular, extrasynovial structure that fills the anterior knee compartment, and is richly vascularized and innervated. Its degree of innervation, the proportion of substance-P-containing fibres and close relationship to its posterior synovial lining implicates IFP pathologies as a source of infrapatellar knee pain. Though the precise function of the IFP is unknown, studies have shown that it may play a role in the biomechanics of the knee or act as a store for reparative cells after injury. Inflammation and fibrosis within the IFP, caused by trauma and/or surgery can lead to a variety of arthrofibrotic lesions including Hoffa's disease, anterior interval scarring and infrapatellar contracture syndrome. Lesions or mass-like abnormalities rarely occur within the IFP, but their classification can be narrowed down by radiographical appearance. Clinically, patients with IFP pathology present with burning or aching infrapatellar anterior knee pain that can often be reproduced on physical exam with manoeuvres designed to produce impingement. Sagittal MRI is the most common imaging technique used to assess IFP pathology including fibrosis, inflammation, oedema, and mass-like lesions. IFP pathology is often successfully managed with physical therapy. Passive taping is used to unload or shorten an inflamed IFP, and closed chain quadriceps exercises can improve lower limb control and patellar congruence. Training of the gluteus medius and stretching the anterior hip may help to decrease internal rotation of the hip and valgus force at the knee. Gait training and avoiding hyperextension can also be used for long-term management. Injections within the IFP of local anaesthetic plus corticosteroids and IFP ablation with ultrasound guided alcohol injections have been successfully explored as treatments for IFP pain. IFP pathology refractory to physical therapy can be approached through a variety of operative treatments. Arthroscopic partial resection for IFP impingement and Hoffa's disease has showed favourable results; however, total excision of the IFP performed concomitantly with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) resulted in worse results when compared with TKA alone. Arthroscopic debridement of IFP fibrosis has been successfully used to treat extension block following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopic anterior interval release has been an effective treatment for pain associated with anterior interval scarring. Arthroscopic resection of infrapatellar plicae and denervation of the inferior pole of the patella have also been shown to be effective treatments for refractory infrapatellar pain.", "journal": "Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["Jason LDragoo", "ChristinaJohnson", "JennyMcConnell"], "doi": "10.2165/11595680-000000000-00000"}

Targeting of tumour blood vessels using gene therapy is attractive, although optimal enzyme prodrug combinations have yet to be identified.\nSeven enzyme prodrug combinations were ranked in two endothelial (HUVEC, HMEC-1) and one tumour cell line (T24) for their ability to reduce proliferation and viability. The ability to destroy bystander cells in two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D), mode of cell kill, and the ability to disrupt vascular networks were measured.\nEndothelial cell proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine uptake) was reduced most effectively by Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) with ganciclovir (GCV), followed by Escherichia coli nitroreductase NfsB (NTR) with CB1954; viability [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay] was reduced most efficiently by NTR/CB1954 followed by TK/GCV. Of the seven combinations, only NTR/CB1954 displayed measurable bystander effects in 2D monolayers, and none demonstrated bystander killing in coated spheroids, a 3D spatially distinct model with tissue-like cell density. NTR-expressing endothelial cells displayed increased apoptosis, necrosis and caspase-3 activity after CB1954 treatment. Despite good antiproliferative activity, TK/GCV was ineffective at disrupting vascular network-like structures of endothelial cells, whereas NTR/CB1954 was efficient. NTR/metronidazole and the vascular disrupting agent, combretastatin A-4 phosphate, were the only other effective agents.\nCollectively, these data demonstrate that cytotoxic rather than cytostatic activity is necessary for efficient vascular disruption in vitro, and bystander killing is not essential.

EPO increased bone fusion volume to 3.85 ccm (3.66-4.05) compared with 3.26 ccm (2.97-3.55) in the control group (p<0.01). EPO treatment improved vascularization of the fusion mass and increased hemoglobin levels (p<0.01). Fusion rate tended to be higher in the EPO group based on manual palpation, CT, and radiographic examinations.

In the growth plate and developing neonate bones, LIF deficiency enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, enlarged blood vessel formation, and increased the formation of \"giant\" osteoclasts/chondroclasts that rapidly destroyed the mineralized regions of the growth plate and developing neonatal bone. Below this region, osteoblasts formed large quantities of woven bone. In contrast, in adult bone undergoing remodeling osteoclast formation was unaffected by LIF deficiency, whereas osteoblast formation and function were both significantly impaired, resulting in osteopenia. Consistent with LIF promoting osteoblast commitment, enhanced marrow adipocyte formation was also observed in adult LIF null mice, and adipocytic differentiation of murine stromal cells was delayed by LIF treatment. LIF, therefore, controls vascular size and osteoclast differentiation during the transition of cartilage to bone, whereas an anatomically separate LIF-dependent pathway regulates osteoblast and adipocyte commitment in bone remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2011-12-07", "authors": ["Ingrid JPoulton", "Narelle EMcGregor", "SueliPompolo", "Emma CWalker", "Natalie ASims"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.1485"}

Decades after chest wall irradiation, very late onset radiation-induced osteomyelitis can develop, caused by osteoradionecrosis. This may lead to the development of small, but very refractory, skin ulcers. Many reports recommend well-vascularized tissue coverage after appropriate debridement for irradiation ulcers; however, when the ulcers are of very late onset, this sometimes causes recurrence of ulceration in non-muscle-covered areas after flap transfer. Thus, for very late onset cases, we propose treatment with an absolute muscle flap to cover both the obviously infected focus and the surrounding irradiated area. A muscle flap consisting of the entire latissimus dorsi, the shape of which is very large in the horizontal direction, satisfies this requirement.

We hypothesize that the low GAG content of osteoarthritic cartilage renders the tissue susceptible to pathological vascularization. This was investigated using an in vitro angiogenesis model assessing endothelial cell adhesion to GAG-depleted cartilage explants. Bovine cartilage explants were treated with hyaluronidase to deplete GAG content and then seeded with fluorescently tagged human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). HMEC-1 adherence was assessed after 4 hr and 7 days. The effect of hyaluronidase treatment on GAG content, chondrocyte viability, and biochemical composition of the extracellular matrix was also determined. Hyaluronidase treatment reduced the GAG content of cartilage explants by 78 \u00b1 3% compared with that of controls (p < 0.0001). GAG depletion was associated with significantly more HMEC-1 adherence on both the surface (superficial zone) and the underside (deep zone) of the explants (both p < 0.0001). The latter provided a more favorable environment for extended culture of HMEC-1 compared with the articulating surface. Hyaluronidase treatment altered the immunostaining for chondroitin sulfate epitopes, but not for lubricin. Our results support the hypothesis that articular cartilage GAGs are antiadhesive to endothelial cells and suggest that chondroitin sulfate and/or hyaluronan are responsible.

Fisetin (10-50 \u03bcM) strongly inhibited the regular serum plus growth supplement- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced growth (up to 92%, P < 0.001) and survival (up to 16%, P < 0.001) of HUVEC in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Fisetin also caused cell cycle arrest at G(1) (strong) and G(2)/M (moderate) phases together with a decrease in cyclin D1 and an increase in p53 levels. Fisetin-caused cell death was accompanied by decreased expression of survivin and an increase in cleaved levels of caspases-3 and -7 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase along with an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel (up to 85%, P < 0.001) as well as migration (up to 66%, P < 0.001), which were associated with decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and VEGF in HUVEC.

{"title": "EGFRvIII promotes glioma angiogenesis and growth through the NF-\u03baB, interleukin-8 pathway.", "abstract": "Sustaining a high growth rate requires tumors to exploit resources in their microenvironment. One example of this is the extensive angiogenesis that is a typical feature of high-grade gliomas. Here, we show that expression of the constitutively active mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, \u0394EGFR (EGFRvIII, EGFR*, de2-7EGFR) is associated with significantly higher expression levels of the pro-angiogenic factor interleukin (IL)-8 in human glioma specimens and glioma stem cells. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of \u0394EGFR in different glioma cell lines caused up to 60-fold increases in the secretion of IL-8. Xenografts of these cells exhibit increased neovascularization, which is not elicited by cells overexpressing wild-type (wt)EGFR or \u0394EGFR with an additional kinase domain mutation. Analysis of the regulation of IL-8 by site-directed mutagenesis of its promoter showed that \u0394EGFR regulates its expression through the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, activator protein 1 (AP-1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Glioma cells overexpressing \u0394EGFR showed constitutive activation and DNA binding of NF-\u03baB, overexpression of c-Jun and activation of its upstream kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and overexpression of C/EBP\u03b2. Selective pharmacological or genetic targeting of the NF-\u03baB or AP-1 pathways efficiently blocked promoter activity and secretion of IL-8. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of either IL-8 or the NF-\u03baB subunit p65, in \u0394EGFR-expressing cells attenuated their ability to form tumors and to induce angiogenesis when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. On the contrary, the overexpression of IL-8 in glioma cells lacking \u0394EGFR potently enhanced their tumorigenicity and produced highly vascularized tumors, suggesting the importance of this cytokine and its transcription regulators in promoting glioma angiogenesis and tumor growth.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-12-06", "authors": ["RBonavia", "M MInda", "SVandenberg", "S-YCheng", "MNagane", "PHadwiger", "PTan", "D W YSah", "W KCavenee", "F BFurnari"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.563"}

This timetable was conserved when mouse PSM was grafted into a chicken host, which further validates the experimental model. The use of Pax3(GFP/GFP) knockout mice showed that establishment of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is not compromised by the absence of Pax3. Of note, Pax3(GFP/GFP) knockout mouse PSM-derived cells can contribute to aortic, but not to limb, SMCs that are derived from the somatopleure.

Scar tissue samples from wounds on the 7th, 14th and 21st days of healing were evaluated for hydroxyproline and vascular endothelial growth factor content. Macrophage, lymphocyte, fibroblast and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration; collagen formation and vascularization were assessed by light and electron microscopy. The free oxygen radical content of the wounds was measured by a chemiluminescence method. Blood sample analysis showed that the hydroxyproline and total testosterone levels were significantly higher, and the oxygen radical content was significantly lower in young rats.

{"title": "Functional resurfacing of the palm: flap selection based on defect analysis.", "abstract": "Extensive defect coverage of the palm and anatomical reconstruction of its unique functional capacity remains difficult. In manual laborers, reconstruction of sensation, range of motion, grip strength but also mechanical stability is required. Sensate musculo-/fasciocutaneous flaps bear disadvantages of tissue mobility with shifting/bulkiness under stress. Thin muscle and fascial flaps show adherence but preclude sensory nerve coaptation. The purpose of this review is to present our algorithm for reliable selection of the most appropriate procedure based on defect analysis. Defect analysis focusing on units of tactile gnosis provides information to weigh needs for sensation or soft tissue stability. We distinguish radial unit (r)-thenar, ulnar unit (u)-hypothenar and unit (c)-central plus distal palm. Individual parameters need similar consideration to choose adequate treatment. Unit (r) and unit (u) are regions of secondary touch demanding protective sensation. Restoration of sensation using neurovascular, fasciocutaneous flaps is recommended. In unit (c), tactile gnosis is of less, mechanical resistance of greater value. Reconstruction of soft tissue resistance is suggested first in this unit. In laborers, free fascial- or muscle flaps with plantar instep skin grafts may achieve near to anatomical reconstruction with minimal sensation. Combined defects involving unit (c) require correlation with individual parameters for optimal flap selection. Defect coverage of the palm should not consist of merely providing sensate vascularized tissue. The most appropriate procedure should be derived from careful defect analysis to achieve near to anatomical reconstruction. In laborers, defect related demands need close correlation with sensation and mechanical stability to be expected.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2011-11-29", "authors": ["T OEngelhardt", "U MRieger", "A HSchwabegger", "GPierer"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.20951"}

Herein, we demonstrated that hypoxia-induced IGF-II could contribute to retinal vascularization in ocular development. In the developing retina, IGF-II expression appears to be predominant on retinal vessels, which was chronologically increased and peaked during active retinal angiogenesis similar to VEGF expression. Under hypoxic condition, IGF-II as well as VEGF was significantly up-regulated in retinal vascular endothelial cells. In addition, IGF-II treatment could also increase VEGF expression in retinal vascular endothelial cells. The VEGF expression induced by IGF-II was mediated by ERK-1/2 activation. Moreover, IGF-II strongly promoted angiogenic processes of migration and tube formation of retinal microvascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, our results provided that hypoxia-induced IGF-II may regulate retinal vascular development not only directly by IGF-II-mediated angiogenic activity, but also indirectly by IGF-II-induced VEGF expression. Therefore, the potential contribution of IGF-II to pathological retinal angiogenesis should be furthermore explored for the development of novel treatments to vaso-proliferative retinopathies.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2011-11-29", "authors": ["Jin HyoungKim", "Sung WookPark", "Young SukYu", "Kyu-WonKim", "Jeong HunKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2011.11.003"}

{"title": "Rapamycin inhibits transforming growth factor \u03b2-induced peritoneal angiogenesis by blocking the secondary hypoxic response.", "abstract": "Patients with end-stage kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis often develop progressive scarring of the peritoneal tissues. This manifests as submesothelial thickening and is associated with increased vascularization that leads to ultrafiltration dysfunction. Hypoxia induces a characteristic series of responses including angiogenesis and fibrosis. We investigated the role of hypoxia in peritoneal membrane damage. An adenovirus expressing transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 was used to induce peritoneal fibrosis. We evaluated the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which has been previously shown to block hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1\u03b1. We also assessed the effect of HIF1\u03b1 independently using an adenovirus expressing active HIF1\u03b1. To identify the TGF\u03b21-independent effects of HIF1\u03b1, we expressed HIF1\u03b1 in the peritoneum of mice lacking the TGF\u03b2 signalling molecule Smad3. We demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-induced fibroproliferative tissue is hypoxic. Rapamycin did not affect the early angiogenic response, but inhibited angiogenesis and submesothelial thickening 21 days after induction of fibrosis. In primary mesothelial cell culture, rapamycin had no effect on TGF\u03b2-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but did suppress hypoxia-induced VEGF. HIF1\u03b1 induced submesothelial thickening and angiogenesis in peritoneal tissue. The fibrogenic effects of HIF1\u03b1 were Smad3 dependent. In summary, submesothelial hypoxia may be an important secondary factor, which augments TGF\u03b2-induced peritoneal injury. The hypoxic response is mediated partly through HIF1\u03b1 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks the hypoxic-induced angiogenic effects but does not affect the direct TGF\u03b2-mediated fibrosis and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2011-11-29", "authors": ["YoshimiSekiguchi", "JingZhang", "SarahPatterson", "LiminLiu", "ChiekoHamada", "YasuhikoTomino", "Peter JMargetts"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01493.x"}

In many cases cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only option for fertility preservation.

Therefore, methods to improve and hasten graft vascularization are needed. The aim of the study was to examine the benefits of host and graft treatments with melatonin, hyaluronan (HA), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vitamin E with regard to the outcome of human ovarian tissue grafting.\nFive young cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic ovarian surgery for fertility preservation donated ovarian tissue.

Rats with chemically induced mammary tumors were divided into two nutritional groups: a control group and a group fed with an n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Both groups were treated with docetaxel. Functional vascular parameters (ultrasounds, interstitial fluid pressure) were determined for both nutritional groups before (W(0)) and during docetaxel treatment [every 2 h up to 1 week (W(+1)) for interstitial fluid pressure, at W(+1) for Evans blue extravasation and at W(+2) and W(+6) for ultrasounds]. In vitro n-3 PUFA-induced changes in endothelial cell migration, permeability and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Whereas docetaxel stabilized tumor growth in the rat control group, it induced a 50% tumor regression in the n-3 PUFA group. Ultrasounds parameters were consistently lower in the n-3 PUFA group at all time points measured, down to \u223c50% at W(+6). A single dose of docetaxel in the n-3 PUFA group markedly reduced interstitial fluid pressure from 2 h after injection up to W(+1) when Evans blue extravasation was increased by 3-fold. A decreased activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in tumors of the n-3 PUFA group, and in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultured with n-3 PUFA, points toward a PUFA-induced disruption of nitric oxide signaling pathway.

The critical step in bone formation is to replace the avascular cartilage template with vascularized bone. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are associated with each other, sharing some essential regulators. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression is not well known in osteoblasts. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR results revealed that VEGF expression was down-regulated in Osx-null calvarial cells and that osteoblast marker osteocalcin expression was absent. Overexpression of Osx in stable C2C12 mesenchymal cells using a Tet-off system resulted in up-regulation of both osteocalcin and VEGF expression. The inhibition of Osx by siRNA led to repression of VEGF expression in osteoblasts. These results suggest that Osx controls VEGF expression. Transfection assays demonstrated that Osx activated VEGF promoter activity. A series of VEGF promoter deletion mutants were examined and the minimal Osx-responsive region was defined to the proximal 140-bp region of the VEGF promoter. Additional point mutants were used to identify two GC-rich regions that were responsible for VEGF promoter activation by Osx. Gel shift assay showed that Osx bound to the VEGF promoter sequence directly. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that endogenous Osx associated with the native VEGF promoter in primary osteoblasts.

The objective is to retrospectively analyze neurosurgical patients with complex, recalcitrant wound-healing problems we had treated in our department, attempt to develop a grading system based on the risk factors specific to our specialty and adapt a surgical reconstruction algorithm.\nDuring an 11-year period, 49 patients were identified to have had complex, recalcitrant wound-healing problems involving the cranial vault (n\u2009=\u200943) and the skull base (n\u2009=\u20096) that required an adapted surgical wound-management strategy. The etiologies of wound healing problems were aftermaths of surgical treatment of: (1) brain tumors (nine cases), (2) aneurysm clipping (ten cases), (3) trauma (27 patients), and (4) congenital malformations (three patients). Local rotational advancement flaps were performed in 18 patients and free microvascular tissue transfer was performed in 37 cases.\nMajor risk factors leading to recalcitrant wound healing problems in the presented group were: prolonged angiographic interventions (20%), ongoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy (47%), prolonged cortisone application (51%), CSF leak (76%) and, above all, multiple failed attempts at wound closure (94%). Stable long-term wound healing was achieved in all patients using vascularized tissue coverage. A ternary grading system was developed based on various risk factors in the presented cohort. Accordingly, the algorithm for reconstruction in neurosurgical patients was adapted.\nPrimary disease, treatment history, and distorted anatomical structures are major concerns in the management of complex wound-healing problems in neurosurgical patients. The higher the risk factors involved, the more complex is the surgical strategy. Free microvascular tissue transfer offers stable long-term results in recalcitrant cases.

{"title": "Fibroblast growth factor-1-induced ERK1/2 signaling reciprocally regulates proliferation and smooth muscle cell differentiation of ligament-derived endothelial progenitor cell-like cells.", "abstract": "The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a fibrous connective tissue located between the tooth root and the alveolar bone. We previously demonstrated that a single cell-derived culture of primarily cultured PDL fibroblasts has the potential to construct an endothelial cell (EC) marker-positive blood vessel-like structure, suggesting that the fibroblastic lineage cells in ligament tissue could act as the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which regenerate to construct a vascular system around the damaged ligament tissue. Moreover, we showed that EPC-like fibroblasts expressed not only EC markers but also smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers. Generally, an interaction between ECs and SMCs regulates blood vessel development and remodeling, and is required for the formation of a mature and functional vascular network. However, the mechanism underlying the SMC differentiation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts remains to be clarified. In this study, we showed that suppression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling with the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 completely abolished the FGF-1-induced proliferation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts. In addition, U0126 treatment of FGF-1-stimulated ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts significantly induced the SMC differentiation of the cells. Thus, FGF-1-induced ERK1/2 signaling not only promoted the proliferation of the ligament-derived EPC-like fibroblasts, but also suppressed the SMC differentiation of the cells, suggesting that FGF-1 controls the construction of a vascular network around the ligament tissue by regulating the proliferation and SMC differentiation of the EPC-like cells through ERK-mediated signaling.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2011-11-24", "authors": ["MikakoTakahashi", "NaotoOkubo", "NaoyukiChosa", "NorikoTakahashi", "MihoIbi", "MasaharuKamo", "HarumiMizuki", "AkiraIshisaki", "SeikoKyakumoto"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2011.847"}

To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) alterations of microvasculature following SCI, we utilized an established rat SCI model. Based on the hypothesis that the spinal cord would undergo reorganization and postinjury modification of the vascular networks after SCI, we reconstructed the normal and injured angioarchitecture using micro-CT images of silicone rubber microsphere-perfused specimens. Several morphometric parameters were used to study the 3D vascular alterations in the SCI rat model, including the casting-based vessel volume fraction, connectivity density, separation, thickness and thickness distribution. Our results indicated that the microvascular spatial conformations were significantly different between the normal and injured spinal cord segments. The morphometric changes showed an increase of the vessel volume fraction and separation and a decrease of vessel connectivity density during the vascular healing process after SCI. Our results may contribute to elucidation of the mechanisms of compensatory vascular reconstitution in traumatized spinal cord. The method used here has the potential to improve our understanding of changes in the spatial architecture of vascular networks after SCI compared to the conventional histomorphology techniques.

Neuropilins and semaphorins are highly expressed in a wide spectrum of tumors and have been shown to influence their growth and vascularization. Despite the growing body of data on neuropilin/semaphorin regulation of tumor growth, still the exact mechanism of their activity remains to be elucidated. Previously published data suggests that Nrp1 has both anti- and promigratory characteristics in different tumor types, although no data is available on its role in melanoma cells. In this paper, we studied the effect of Nrp1 downregulation on B16(F10) melanoma cells migration. Our results show that the silencing of Nrp1 significantly increases the overall mobility of B16(F10) cells and changes their morphology. Moreover, Nrp1-silenced B16(F10) cells show a decreased response to Sema3A. We also observed reduced binding of Sema3A to these cells. Contrarily, no changes were observed in the binding of Sema3C to Nrp1-silenced B16(F10) cells, nor in its chemorepellent activity. Our results suggest that modulation of B16(F10) cells migratory ability by semaphorin 3A can be preferentially mediated by Nrp1, while the contribution of semaphorin 3C in this process is less evident. In addition, silencing of Nrp1 did not change the migratory ability of B16(F10) cells towards VEGF.", "journal": "Neoplasma", "date": "2011-11-16", "authors": ["A MMazurek", "MOlbryt"], "doi": "10.4149/neo_2012_006"}

For example, overexpression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at controlled levels is an attractive strategy to overcome the crucial bottleneck of graft vascularization and to avoid aberrant vascular growth. Since the regenerative potential of MSCs is rapidly lost during in vitro expansion, we sought to develop an optimized technique to achieve high-efficiency retroviral vector transduction of MSCs derived from both adipose tissue (adipose stromal cells, ASCs) or bone marrow (BMSCs) and rapidly select cells expressing desired levels of VEGF with minimal in vitro expansion. The proliferative peak of freshly isolated human ASCs and BMSCs was reached 4 and 6 days after plating, respectively. By performing retroviral vector transduction at this time point, >90% efficiency was routinely achieved before the first passage. MSCs were transduced with vectors expressing rat VEGF(164) quantitatively linked to a syngenic cell surface marker (truncated rat CD8). Retroviral transduction and VEGF expression did not affect MSC phenotype nor impair their in vitro proliferation and differentiation potential. Transgene expression was also maintained during in vitro differentiation. Furthermore, three subpopulations of transduced BMSCs homogeneously producing specific low, medium, and high VEGF doses could be prospectively isolated by flow cytometry based on the intensity of their CD8 expression already at the first passage.

We investigated whether cells with an enhanced efficacy for cardiac cell therapy could be enriched from adult human skeletal muscle on the basis of their adhesion properties to tissue culture flasks following tissue dissociation.

The slowly adhering cell (SAC) population also survived better than the RAC population in kinetic in vitro assays that simulate conditions of oxidative and inflammatory stress. When evaluated for the treatment of a myocardial infarction (MI), intramyocardial injection of the SACs more effectively improved echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and contractility than the transplantation of the RACs. Immunohistological analysis revealed that hearts injected with SACs displayed a reduction in myocardial fibrosis and an increase in infarct vascularization, donor cell proliferation, and endogenous cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation in comparison with the RAC-treated hearts.

In vitro studies on HUVEC showed that GNX-686 inhibited cell growth with an ED(50) of 20-25 \u03bcM, while human HeLa tumor cells and non-transformed embryonic mouse fibroblasts were less sensitive for the drug. More importantly, at 4 \u03bcM, a concentration that was non-toxic to any cell in culture, GNX-686 showed a significant inhibitory effect on tube formation by HUVEC, indicating a profound anti-angiogenic activity. Angiogenesis inhibition was subsequenly tested in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo. A significant angiostatic activity was observed in the CAM model, and results were compared with the effect of bevacizumab, a well known and clinically used VEGF inhibitor. Under our experimental conditions, GNX-686 was found to be as effective as bevacizumab, significantly changing the morphology of the vascular network, as illustrated and quantified by the relative number of branching points and the relative mean mesh size of the vascular network. In another in vivo model of neovascularization, the mouse retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the vascular network of GNX-686-treated mice was significantly altered, reducing the density of the retinal microvasculature, as compared to the control retinas. Immunohistochemical processing of the GNX-686 treated (4\u03bcM) eyes showed over 50% reduction of the number of cell nuclei associated with neovasculature, as compared to the control-treated eye.

Twenty nodules (10 benign and 10 malignant), taken from 3-D high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) images were used for this work. Malignancy was confirmed using fine needle aspiration biopsy and subsequent histological studies. A combination of discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and texture algorithms were used to extract relevant features from the thyroid images. These features were fed to different configurations of AdaBoost classifier. The performance of these configurations was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our results show that the combination of texture features and DWT features presented an accuracy value higher than that reported in the literature. Among the different classifier setups, the perceptron based AdaBoost yielded very good result and the area under the ROC curve was 1 and classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Finally, we have composed an Integrated Index called thyroid malignancy index (TMI) made up of these DWT and texture features, to facilitate distinguishing and diagnosing benign or malignant nodules using just one index or number.

In the past, this examination has been shown to be useful in the management of patients with different neurovascular disorders.\nClinical records and imaging studies were reviewed in 7 patients with a diagnosis of PS.

First, we injected endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to augment the vascular density in infarcted areas and to improve the benefit of a subsequent Tx of foetal cardiomyocytes. Serial echocardiography indeed showed significant improvement of the left ventricular function after application of EPC and a significant additive improvement after Tx of foetal cardiomyocytes. In contrast, repetitive EPC transplantation as a control group did not show an additional improvement after the second transplantation. Histologically, cells could be readily detected after Tx by BrdU-staining for EPC and by carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-staining for foetal cardiomyocytes. Staining for CD31 revealed a significant increase in vessel density in the infarction area compared with medium controls, possibly contributing to the benefit of transplanted foetal cardiomyocytes. Notably, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed in cell-transplanted hearts accompanied by an increase in proliferation, collagen content and neutrophil infiltration, suggesting an active remodelling concomitant with sustained inflammatory processes.

The aim of this study was to understand the roles of SP and NE in chondrocyte metabolism and their impact on chondrocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion.\nPrimary costal chondrocytes were isolated from newborn mice. Micromass and monolayer cell culture regimens were used to analyze the effects of SP and NE on matrix formation, as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.

Yet, a direct bilio-biliary anastomosis preserves the normal sphincter mechanism and endoscopic access to the biliary tree for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction is widely used in liver transplantation. The objective of this study was to analyze the feasibility and results of duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction in the setting of complex hepatic resection with limited biliary confluence involvement.\nWe identified patients from our prospectively maintained database that underwent major hepatic resection and bile duct resection with a concomitant direct duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. Postoperative oncological and functional biliary outcomes were analyzed.\nTen patients were studied. In 9 cases, a biliary stent was left in place to decompress the anastomosis. Two patients developed a biliary fistula: one resolved spontaneously and the other required percutaneous drainage and an endoscopic biliary stent. This latter patient (the only nonstented patient) also developed a biliary stricture that was treated endoscopically. With a mean follow-up of 22 months, no other biliary-related complications were recorded. No patients had a recurrence at the biliary reconstruction site only. In the setting of multifocal hepatic recurrence presenting with jaundice, two patients were palliated by interventional endoscopy.\nFor hepatectomy requiring a short resection of the bile duct or for high bile duct injury during complex hepatectomy, a tension-free, well-vascularized duct-to-duct reconstruction over a stent is a suitable option that offers good oncological clearance of the bile duct and satisfactory functional results.", "journal": "World journal of surgery", "date": "2011-11-01", "authors": ["RiccardoMemeo", "AndreaBelli", "Michael DKluger", "ClaudeTayar", "AlexisLaurent", "DanielCherqui"], "doi": "10.1007/s00268-011-1318-x"}

Circulating numbers of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (BMDECs), which facilitate angiogenesis and contribute to repair of vascular endothelium, increase during pregnancy. Thus, we hypothesized that relaxin enhances BMDEC NO production, circulating numbers, and function. Recombinant human relaxin-2 (rhRLX) stimulated PI3K/Akt B-dependent NO production in human BMDECs within minutes, and activated BMDEC migration that was inhibited by L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester. In BMDECs isolated from relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 2 gene (Rxfp2) knockout and wild-type mice, but not Rxfp1 knockout mice, rhRLX rapidly increased NO production. Similarly, rhRLX increased circulating BMDEC number in Rxfp2 knockout and wild-type mice, but not Rxfp1 knockout mice as assessed by colony formation and flow cytometry. Taken together, these results indicate that relaxin effects BMDEC function through the RXFP1 receptor. Finally, both vascularization and incorporation of GFP-labeled BMDECs were stimulated in rhRLX-impregnated Matrigel pellets implanted in mice.

The chorioallantoic placenta contains an elliptical-shaped region, the placentome, characterized by hypertrophied uterine and embryonic epithelial cells supported by dense vascular networks. The remainder of the chorioallantoic placenta, the paraplacentome, is also highly vascularized but uterine and chorionic epithelia are thin. An omphaloplacenta with hypertrophied epithelia is located in the abembryonic hemisphere of the egg. There is extensive placental transport of organic and inorganic nutrients, e.g., 85-90% of neonatal calcium is received via placental transfer. Calcium uptake by extraembryonic membranes of squamates correlates with expression of the intracellular calcium binding protein, calbindin-D(28K) , and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) is a marker for active calcium transport. We estimated expression of calbindin-D(28K) and PMCA in the chorioallantoic membrane in a developmental series of embryos using immunoblotting and used immunohistochemistry to define the cellular localization of calbindin-D(28K) to test the hypotheses that 1) expression of calcium transporting proteins is coincident with placental transport of calcium and 2) the placenta is functionally specialized for calcium transport in regions of structural differentiation. Calbindin-D(28K) and PMCA were detected at low levels in early stages of development and increased significantly prior to birth, when embryonic calcium uptake peaks. These data support the hypothesis that placental calcium secretion occurs over an extended interval of gestation, with increasing activity as embryonic demand escalates in late development. In addition, calbindin-D(28K) expression is localized in chorionic epithelial cells of the placentome and in the epithelium of the omphalopleure of the omphaloplacenta, which supports the hypothesis that regional structural differentiation in the placenta reflects functional specializations for calcium transport.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["Haley KStinnett", "James RStewart", "Tom WEcay", "Rebecca APyles", "Jacquie FHerbert", "Michael BThompson"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.11030"}
{"title": "Towards more rationalized approach to autologous fat grafting.", "abstract": "Even though fat grafting has become widely used by plastic surgeons, most surgeons choose their method of fat grafting based almost entirely on anecdotal evidence. As more and more scientific studies appear in the literature, we now may have more objective, scientific evidence to support the use of specific techniques.\nThe author critically reviewed all studies related to fat grafting research in the last 20 years in the English literature. To better summarize the findings of the studies, the fat grafting procedure was arbitrarily divided into 4 essential parts to determine the best donor sites and how the fat grafts should be harvested, processed, and placed.\nWhile most studies show no difference in the viability of fat grafts harvested from different donor sites, one study shows that more adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are found within the fat grafts harvested from the lower abdomen or inner thigh. Fat grafts harvested with syringe aspiration and processed with centrifugation at 1200 g for 3 min clearly have better viability. In addition, viable adipocytes and ADSCs as well as growth factors can be concentrated within the fat grafts after proper centrifugation. The studies also reinforce the principle that fat grafts, once placed, should have a maximal amount of contact with the vascularized tissue in the recipient site for better survival.\nMost scientific studies in fat grafting research support a more rationalized technique that should be selected by surgeons for fat grafting.

{"title": "Comparison of different fabrication techniques for human adipose tissue engineering in severe combined immunodeficient mice.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue engineering has been advocated for soft-tissue augmentation and for the treatment of soft tissue defects. The efficacy in terms of persistence of the engineered fat is, however, not yet understood and could depend on the nature of fabrication and application. The high metabolic demand of adipose tissue also points to the problem of vascularization. Endothelial cell (EC) cotransplantation could be a solution. Human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells were seeded on collagen microcarriers and submitted to adipogenic differentiation (\"microparticles\"). In a first run of experiments, these microparticles were implanted under the skin of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (n\u2003=\u200345) with and without the addition of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). A group of carriers without any cells served as control. In a second run, adipose tissue constructs were fabricated by embedding microparticles in fibrin matrix with and without the addition of HUVEC, and were also implanted in SCID mice (n\u2003=\u200330). The mice were sacrificed after 12 days, 4 weeks, and 4 months. Mature adipose tissue, fibrous tissue, and acellular regions were quantified on whole-specimen histological sections. The implantation of microparticles showed a better sustainment of tissue volume and a higher degree of mature adipose tissue compared with adipose tissue constructs. Immunohistology proved obviously perfused human tissue-engineered vessels. There was a limited but not significant advantage in EC cotransplantation after 4 weeks in terms of tissue volume. In groups with EC cotransplantation, there were significantly fewer acellular/necrotic areas after 4 weeks and 4 months. In conclusion, the size of the implanted tissue equivalents is a crucial parameter, affecting volume maintenance and the gain of mature adipose tissue.

{"title": "MULTIMERIN2 impairs tumor angiogenesis and growth by interfering with VEGF-A/VEGFR2 pathway.", "abstract": "MULTIMERIN2 (MMRN2), also known as Endoglyx-1, is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein whose function has so far remained elusive. Given its specific localization in tight association with the endothelium we hypothesized that this protein could modulate neo-angiogenesis. By multiple assays we showed that MMRN2 significantly impaired endothelial cell (EC) migration and organization of a functional vessel network. The interaction of ECs with MMRN2 induced a striking impairment of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. We focused our attention on VEGFR2, a chief regulator of angiogenesis, and clarified that MMRN2 interfered with the VEGF/VEGFR2 axis through a direct binding with VEGF-A. This novel interaction was assessed in several assays and the affinity was estimated (Kd \u223c50\u2009 nM). We next questioned whether the anti-angiogenic properties of MMRN2 could impair tumor growth. Although overexpression of MMRN2 by HT1080 cells did not affect their growth and apoptotic rate in vitro, it remarkably affected their growth in vivo. In fact, MMRN2-positive cells failed to efficiently grow and form well-vascularized tumors; a similar outcome was observed following treatment of established tumors with a MMRN2 adenoviral construct. Tumor-section immunostaining revealed a strong co-localization of VEGF-A with the ectopically expressed MMRN2. These novel findings suggest that VEGF may be sequestered by MMRN2 and be less available for the engagement to the receptors. Taken together these results highlight MMRN2 as a crucial player in the regulation of EC function, neo-angiogenesis and hence tumor growth. We hypothesize that secreted and deposited MMRN2 may function as a homeostatic barrier halting the sprouting of novel vessels, and suggest that these studies may embody the potential for the development of novel tools for cancer treatment.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-10-25", "authors": ["ELorenzon", "RColladel", "EAndreuzzi", "SMarastoni", "FTodaro", "MSchiappacassi", "GLigresti", "AColombatti", "MMongiat"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.487"}

In this study, three separate techniques were evaluated for their capability to increase the pore size of the PCL/col I/nanoHA scaffolds: limited protease digestion, decreasing the fiber packing density during electrospinning, and inclusion of sacrificial fibers of the water-soluble polymer PEO. The PEO sacrificial fiber approach was found to be the most effective in increasing scaffold pore size. Furthermore, the use of sacrificial fibers promoted increased MSC infiltration into the scaffolds, as well as greater infiltration of endogenous cells within bone upon placement of scaffolds within calvarial organ cultures.

In clinical trials, this graft did not prove stiff enough to allow long-term stent withdrawal. This graft insufficiency could be due to ischaemic phase prior to neoangiogenesis. To solve this issue, we investigated both the efficacy of the rabbit lateral thoracic fascial flap as a vehicle for revascularization of the AA and construction of a tube-shaped graft with transferable vascular pedicle, for more efficient replacement of the trachea.\nThirty-four New Zealand rabbits were used. After harvesting of donors 'thoracic aortas', the fresh aortic allografts were transplanted within 1 h, and the others were cryopreserved. Fifteen male and four female rabbits were used as recipients for fresh (n = 9) or cryopreserved (n = 10) aortic allografts that were implanted under the skin of the chest wall, after graft wrap using a pedicled lateral thoracic fascial flap. Animal sacrifice was scheduled at regular intervals up to 61 days. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to study the morphology, revascularization process and viability of the construct.\nThere was no operative death. Animals showed no graft rejection, despite the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. They all had a satisfactory tubular morphology of their construct. Of the 19 rabbits, 15 were found to have a generally preserved histological structure of the aorta and satisfactory neoangiogenesis. In the last four, a severe wound complication was associated with necrosis of the aortic graft. FISH on three aortic grafts with satisfactory neoangiogenesis showed migration of recipient cells into the aortic graft, decreasing from the adventitial to the luminal side, associated with the persistence of cells from the donor.\nOur results showed that the chimeric construct transformed into a well-vascularized tube-shaped organ with transferable pedicle and some degree of stiffness. Persistence of donor's cells of normal morphology into the aortic graft was suggestive of minimal ischaemia during the initial phase of revascularization.

Five identical static 3D power Doppler volumes of the placenta were acquired using identical machine settings apart from altering the power Doppler gain setting. The gain settings included the individualized SNG setting (determined by increasing gain until noise artifact was visible, then reducing it until the artifact just disappeared). The data were analyzed using VOCAL II. Vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated for the same sample at five different power Doppler gain levels. The relationship between the values calculated for the VOCAL indices and the gain value was explored using linear regression analysis.\nResults from 50 women were analyzed. The percentage difference in VI and VFI from that observed at the SNG level in each woman was significantly linearly related to the gain setting relative to that at the SNG point (VI: r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.0001; VFI: r(2) = 0.72, P < 0.0001), with the values produced for VI and VFI decreasing as the gain was turned down. There was a distinct 'turning point' at the SNG level with linear relationships above and below, but with significantly different gradients (P \u2264 0.001). This relationship was not demonstrated for FI.\nThe SNG setting appears to represent each individual's optimum gain level. Using this may improve meaningful comparisons of VI and VFI between patients.", "journal": "Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology", "date": "2011-10-20", "authors": ["S LCollins", "G NStevenson", "J ANoble", "LImpey", "A WWelsh"], "doi": "10.1002/uog.10122"}

To assess the possible involvement of COX-2 signaling in the pro-tumorigenic effects of IGF-1 in mammary glands, we used the unique BK5.IGF-1 mouse model in which transgenic (Tg) mice have significantly increased incidence of spontaneous and DMBA-induced mammary cancer compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Studies revealed that COX-2 expression was significantly increased in Tg mammary glands and tumors, compared to age-matched WTs. Consistent with this, PGE(2) levels were also increased in Tg mammary glands. Analysis of expression of the EP receptors that mediate the effects of PGE(2) showed that among the four G-protein-coupled receptors, EP3 expression was elevated in Tg glands. Up-regulation of the COX-2/PGE(2) /EP3 pathway was accompanied by increased expression of VEGF and a striking enhancement of angiogenesis in IGF-1 Tg mammary glands. Treatment with celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, caused a 45% reduction in mammary PGE(2) levels, attenuated the influx of mast cells and reduced vascularization in Tg glands. These findings indicate that the COX-2/PGE(2) /EP3 signaling pathway is involved in IGF-1-stimulated mammary tumorigenesis and that COX-2-selective inhibitors may be useful in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer associated with elevated IGF-1 levels in humans. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "journal": "Molecular carcinogenesis", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["JieTian", "IsabelLambertz", "Thomas RBerton", "Joyce ERundhaug", "KaoruKiguchi", "Stephanie HShirley", "JohnDigiovanni", "Claudio JConti", "Susan MFischer", "RobinFuchs-Young"], "doi": "10.1002/mc.20868"}

There was no significant difference of corneal scarring and vascularization between the 2 groups before surgery. Choosing PK or full-bed DLK depended on the patient's own willingness, except those patients with a preoperative endothelial cell count of less than 700 cells/mm(2) or whose endothelial cell count was undetectable were encouraged to undergo only PK. Exclusion criteria were patients with a past history of corneal perforation, nonprimary graft, non-HSK-related corneal scars, and failure to complete a minimum of 12 months of postoperative follow-up. Fifty-eight eyes of 58 patients in the full-bed DLK group and 63 eyes of 63 patients in the PK group met the inclusion criteria. main outcome measures: Postoperative managements, recurrence of HSK, graft rejection, graft survival rate, visual acuity, and corneal endothelial density.\nThe mean postoperative follow-up duration was 45.8 \u00b1 30.9 months in the full-bed DLK group and 47.9 \u00b1 27.2 months in the PK group (P = .70). As compared with the PK group, the full-bed DLK group experienced earlier suture removal (P = .01), needed fewer postoperative visits (P < .001), and had a higher proportion of eyes with full withdrawal of oral acyclovir (P < .001) and topical corticosteroid (P < .001). There were a total of 21 episodes of recurrent HSK in the PK group, more frequent than the 7 episodes in the full-bed DLK group, among which recurrent epithelial keratitis amounted to 13 episodes in the PK group, remarkably more frequent than the 1 episode in the full-bed DLK group. Twenty-six eyes (41.3%) encountered rejection episodes in the PK group, but no rejection episode was found in the full-bed DLK group (P < .001). In 14 eyes in the PK group, graft failure developed because of graft rejection, recurrence of HSK, or both, whereas only in 1 eye in the full-bed DLK group did graft failure develop because of recurrence of HSK (P = .001). The clear graft survival rate in the full-bed DLK group was significantly higher than that in the PK group (P = .01). Corneal endothelial cell density was stable from 1 month through 5 years in the full-bed DLK group, but 51.3% cell loss was found in the PK group at 5 years after surgery. At the last visit, 66.1% of eyes with full-bed DLK grafts and 50.9% of eyes with PK grafts achieved a best-correct visual acuity of 0.5 or better (P = .10).\nAdvantages of full-bed DLK over PK are no allograft rejection, longer graft survival, earlier drug withdrawal of topical steroid and oral acyclovir, less recurrence of HSK, and fewer follow-up visits.

Urethral glanular reconstruction included a deep dorsal incision followed by complete scar excision to create a deep groove presenting well-vascularized recipient bed ensuring appropriate graft healing.\nBetween April 2002 and January 2008, a total of 34 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 14-85 years) were enrolled in the study. Congenital anomalies included hypospadia (n = 19, 53%) and epispadia (n = 2, 6%). Condition of strictures was either iatrogenic (n = 7), due to infection (n = 5), or traumatic (n = 1). Foreskin grafts were used in 13 cases, foreskin and buccal mucosa in one case, penile skin in 6 cases, and inguinal skin/thigh (harvested by electrodermatom) in 14 cases. The combination of meticulous scar excision with a deep incision of the glans was used to provide a well-vascularized grafting bed, thus ensuring excellent graft healing. The outcome analysis included urinary flow, urethral calibration >18 ch, voiding cystometry, and patient's satisfaction in a follow-up regime every 3 months.\nThe average graft length was 4.7 cm (median 8, range 1.5-14). Mean follow-up was 70 months. In 31 patients (91%), no recurrent glanular stenosis was observed resulting in a post-operative flow of average 26.2 ml/s (11-53).

Importantly, this study created PLGA films with various nanotopographies (specifically, nano-smooth, 23, 300, and 400 nm hemispherical surface features) but similar surface chemistry in order to focus only on the effect of PLGA topography on cancer cell functions. Simple and effective cast-molding and solvent evaporation methods were used to accomplish this. Atomic force microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and water contact angle measurements verified similar surface chemistry and energy but varied topographies for all of the PLGA films prepared in this study. Lung epithelial carcinoma cell adhesion, proliferation, and morphology results indicated less cell growth and spreading on nano-smooth and 400 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to any other samples. However, results also demonstrated decreased lung epithelial carcinoma cell VEGF (a key growth factor secreted for the vascularization of tumors) synthesis on the 23 nm surface-featured PLGA compared to the nano-smooth substrates for up to 5 days.

In this study we aimed to focus on the area postrema, which is so far little studied in humans, in a large sample of subjects aged from 25 gestational weeks to 10 postnatal months, who died of unknown (sudden unexplained perinatal and infant deaths) and known causes (controls). Besides we investigated a possible link between alterations of this structure, sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths and maternal smoking. By the application of morphological and immunohistochemical methods, we observed a significantly high incidence of alterations of the area postrema in fetal and infant victims of sudden death as compared with age-matched controls. These pathological findings, including hypoplasia, lack of vascularization, cystic formations and reactive gliosis, were related to maternal smoking. We hypothesize that components from maternal cigarette smoke, particularly in pregnancy, could affect neurons of the area postrema connected with specific nervous centers involved in the control of vital functions. In conclusion, we suggest that the area postrema should be in depth examined particularly in victims of sudden fetal or infant death with smoker mothers.", "journal": "Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical", "date": "2011-10-11", "authors": ["Anna MariaLavezzi", "DonatellaMecchia", "LuigiMatturri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.autneu.2011.09.001"}

Recent accumulating evidence suggests that during development the neuronal wiring follows the same routes as the vasculature and that these two systems may share some of the same factors for guidance. Thus, expression of dual angiogenic/neurogenic growth factors was evaluated by in situ hybridization in human primary brain tumors of three different types, i.e., astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas, of increasing grades, in relation with the grade and type of the tumor. For this evaluation we selected vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and its receptors VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 and the neuropilins 1 and 2 (NRP-1 and NRP-2), which have proangiogenic properties, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-beta (PDGF-R\u03b2), which is required for the functional maturation of blood vessels, the ephrins and their Eph receptors, angiotensinogen (AGT) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2), which have potential antiangiogenic properties, and netrin-1 (Net-1), which regulates vascular architecture.

Mobilization of c-Kit(+) hematopoietic cells (HCs) contributes to tumor vascularization. Whereas survival and proliferation of HCs are regulated by binding of the stem cell factor to its receptor c-Kit, migration of HCs is directed by stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1. Therefore, targeting migration of HCs provides a promising new strategy of anti-tumor therapy. Methods. BALB/c mice (n = 16) were pretreated with an anti-c-Kit antibody followed by implantation of CT26.WT-GFP colorectal cancer cells into dorsal skinfold chambers. Animals (n = 8) additionally received a neutralizing anti-SDF-1 antibody. Animals (n = 8) treated with a control antibody served as controls. Investigations were performed using intravital fluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results. Blockade of c-Kit significantly enhanced tumor cell engraftment compared to controls due to stimulation of tumor cell proliferation and invasion without markedly affecting tumor vascularization. C-Kit blockade significantly increased VEGF and CXCR4 expression within the growing tumors. Neutralization of SDF-1 completely antagonized this anti-c-Kit-associated tumor growth by suppression of tumor neovascularization, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and reduction of muscular infiltration.

In all GBM samples, CD133 or Nestin was expressed in tumor and endothelial cells. Double immunofluorescence stainings showed that the two different marked GSCs were found accumulated around the CD31+ blood vessels and CD133/CD31 or Nestin/CD31 co-expression was found in the endothelial cells and GSCs. Furthermore, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the endothelial marker CD31 were co-expressed in GSCs. Therefore, GSCs not only showed distinct perivascular distribution but were capable of differentiating into endothelial cells. We demonstrate that GSCs contribute directly to the tumor vasculature by endothelial cell differentiation. GSCs and tumor vascularization are closely related to each other, not only in the regional distribution but also in biological function. These findings describe a new mechanism for tumor vasculo-genesis and may provide new insights for targeted therapy against brain tumors.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2011-10-06", "authors": ["HuHe", "Chao ShiNiu", "Ming WuLi"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2011.1484"}

For that purpose we performed a prospective non-randomized clinical trial. In 20 consecutive patients suffering from VS and elected for microsurgery via the MCF approach, tumor resection was performed with the aid of the flexible CO(2) laser (\"laser group\", LG). Twenty patients with similar tumor volume and pre-operative hearing status out of a cohort of 76 patients previously treated by the same surgeon without laser were used as comparison group (\"conventional group\", CG) (matched-pair-technique). Facial weakness (House-Brackmann (HB) 2-4) was seen in early postoperative (p.o.) days in six patients in each group and all recovered completely by 3 months p.o., except one patient with HB 2 in CG. Facial nerve preservation rate (HB 1 + 2) was 100% in both groups. Hearing preservation rate (Gardner/Robertson class 1 + 2 or AAO-HNS A + B, pre- and postoperatively) was 72% in LG and 82% in CG, without significant difference. Overall time from incision to skin suture was 157 min (SD 55.9) in CG and 160 min (SD 39.7) in LG. Tumor preparation time was 23.2 min (SD 19.7) in CG and 36.1 min (SD 33.8) in LG. The use of a handheld flexible CO(2) laser fiber in VS-microsurgery is safe and subjectively facilitates tumor resection especially in \"difficult\" (e.g., highly vascularized) tumors. However, in this limited prospective trial the excellent functional outcome following conventional microsurgery could not be further improved, nor the surgical time reduced by means of the non-contact laser-tool.

{"title": "Single-stage reconstruction of skin-involving nasal paraffinoma with pericraniosubgaleal flap.", "abstract": "The removal of a paraffinoma over the nasal bridge may result in thinning and even loss of involved skin as well as a saddle nose deformity. For nasal reconstruction, a variety of techniques using a free graft of autogenous tissue such as fascia, dermofat, or cartilage have been used, either in immediate, single-stage or in delayed, multiphase treatment. However, such reconstructions can be challenging largely due to absorption of the grafted tissue and poor blood supply to the surrounding nasal tissue infiltrated with paraffin. This article reports the successful clinical outcomes of immediate, single-stage reconstructions by wrapping a pericraniosubgaleal flap over the nasal implant after removing a paraffinoma.\nEleven patients with a paraffinoma showing a palpable lump, redness, or telangiectasia over the nasal skin were treated between November 1998 and March 2011. The mean follow-up period was 20.1\u00a0months. As much of the paraffinoma as possible was removed via a bidirectional approach (open rhinoplasty and frontal hairline incision), and the resulting deformity was reconstructed simultaneously using a pericraniosubgaleal flap and turning it over the sculpted nasal implant (ePTFE; GORE-TEX(\u00ae) in nine cases and silicone in two cases).\nNine patients (81.8%) were treated successfully without complications and were satisfied with their results. However, the other two patients complained of incomplete removal of the paraffinoma requiring additional removal. Telangiectasia over the nose improved in four out of six patients after surgery.\nNasal reconstruction using a pericraniosubgaleal flap is one of the most reliable surgical options for treating skin-involving nasal paraffinomas. The advantage of such a method is that a well-vascularized and durable flap, which is resistant to infection, is wrapped over the sculpted nasal implant in a single step. It also reinforces the thinned skin, which makes it easier to form various shapes, producing excellent cosmetic results. Finally, it can also serve as a tolerable graft bed in the case of overlying skin loss.", "journal": "Aesthetic plastic surgery", "date": "2011-10-04", "authors": ["Seung-IlChung", "Young-CheunYou", "Ki-YupKim", "Won-YongYang", "Seok-MinKwon", "Sang-YoonKang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00266-011-9815-8"}

This study evaluates the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and delayed skin graft application as an alternative to free tissue transfer in this compromised population. Bilayer, ADM (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ) was used in conjunction with NPWT (Wound V.A.C, Kinetic Concepts Inc., San Antonio, TX) to achieve vascularized coverage of complex lower extremity wounds with denuded tendon and bone in elderly, medically compromised patients. Following incorporation, the matrix was covered with split-thickness skin graft. Four patients (age range, 50 to 76 years) with multiple medical comorbidities were treated with the above protocol. The average time to complete vascularization of the matrix was 29 days. Definitive closure with split-thickness skin graft was achieved in three patients and one wound healed by secondary intention. No medical or surgical complications were encountered and stable soft tissue coverage was achieved in all patients.

{"title": "Tumor vasculature is a key determinant for the efficiency of nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery.", "abstract": "Delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) to tumors using clinically viable formulations remains the primary technical hurdle that prevents the development of siRNA therapy for cancer treatment. Over the past several years, significant effort has been devoted to explore novel delivery strategies, whereas relatively little attention has been paid to understand the impact of physiological constrains such as tumor vasculature on the efficiency of siRNA delivery. Using the previously described positive-readout tumor models where successful siRNA delivery leads to an upregulation of \u03b2-galactosidase within tumor sections, we analyzed the spatial distribution of localized target knockdown within tumor sections relative to tumor hypoxia and found that stable nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP), a lipid nanoparticle-based delivery system, predominantly delivers siRNA to areas adjacent to functional tumor blood vessels. Increasing tumor vascularity by ectopic expression of VEGF resulted in more efficient siRNA delivery to tumors using SNALP. SNALP-mediated delivery of a siRNA-targeting Ran GTPase led to target knockdown and significant antitumor efficacy in the highly vascularized HepG2-derived liver tumors, but not in the poorly vascularized HCT-116-derived liver tumors.

{"title": "Quantitative analysis of venation patterns of Arabidopsis leaves by supervised image analysis.", "abstract": "The study of transgenic Arabidopsis lines with altered vascular patterns has revealed key players in the venation process, but details of the vascularization process are still unclear, partly because most lines have only been assessed qualitatively. Therefore, quantitative analyses are required to identify subtle perturbations in the pattern and to test dynamic modeling hypotheses using biological measurements. We developed an online framework, designated Leaf Image Analysis Interface (LIMANI), in which venation patterns are automatically segmented and measured on dark-field images. Image segmentation may be manually corrected through use of an interactive interface, allowing supervision and rectification steps in the automated image analysis pipeline and ensuring high-fidelity analysis. This online approach is advantageous for the user in terms of installation, software updates, computer load and data storage. The framework was used to study vascular differentiation during leaf development and to analyze the venation pattern in transgenic lines with contrasting cellular and leaf size traits. The results show the evolution of vascular traits during leaf development, suggest a self-organizing mechanism for leaf venation patterning, and reveal a tight balance between the number of end-points and branching points within the leaf vascular network that does not depend on the leaf developmental stage and cellular content, but on the leaf position on the rosette.

A major product of the COX-2-catalyzed reaction, prostaglandin E(2), is an inflammatory mediator that participates in several biological processes, and influences invasion, vascularization and metastasis. Using noninvasive MRI and MRS, we determined the effect of COX-2 downregulation on the metabolism and invasion of intact poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably expressing COX-2 short hairpin RNA. Dynamic tracking of invasion, extracellular matrix degradation and metabolism was performed with an MRI- and MRS-compatible cell perfusion assay under controlled conditions of pH, temperature and oxygenation over the course of 48 \u2009h. COX-2-silenced cells exhibited a significant decrease in invasion relative to parental cells that was consistent with the reduced expression of invasion-associated matrix metalloproteinase genes and an increased level of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. We identified, for the first time, a role for COX-2 in mediating changes in choline phospholipid metabolism, and established that choline kinase expression is partly dependent on COX-2 function. COX-2 silencing resulted in a significant decrease in phosphocholine and total choline that was detected by MRS. In addition, a significant increase in lipids, as well as lipid droplet formation, was observed. COX-2 silencing transformed parental cell metabolite patterns to those characteristic of less aggressive cancer cells.

{"title": "Low-pressure foaming: a novel method for the fabrication of porous scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Scaffolds for tissue engineering applications must incorporate porosity for optimal cell seeding, tissue ingrowth, and vascularization, but common fabrication methods for achieving porosity are incompatible with a variety of polymers, limiting widespread use. In this study, porous scaffolds consisting of poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) containing hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (HA) were fabricated using low-pressure foaming (LPF). LPF is a novel method of fabricating an interconnected, porous scaffold with relative ease. LPF takes advantage of air bubbles that act as pore nucleation sites during a polymer mixing step. Vacuum is applied to expand the nucleation sites into interconnected pores that are stabilized through cross-linking. POC was combined with 20%, 40%, and 60% by weight HA, and the effect of increasing HA particle content on porosity, mechanical properties, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) was evaluated. The effect of the prepolymer viscosity on porosity and the mechanical properties of POC with 40% by weight HA (POC-40HA) were also assessed. POC-40HA scaffolds were also implanted in an osteochondral defect of a rabbit model, and the explants were assessed at 6 weeks using histology. With increasing HA content, the pore size of POC-HA scaffolds can be varied (85 to 1,003 \u03bcm) and controlled to mimic the pore size of native trabecular bone. The compression modulus increased with greater HA content under dry conditions and were retained to a greater extent than with porous scaffolds fabricated using salt-leaching under wet conditions. Furthermore, all POC-HA scaffolds prepared using LPF supported hMSC attachment, and an increase in ALP activity correlated with an increase in HA content. An increase in the prepolymer viscosity resulted in increased compression modulus, greater distance between pores, and less porosity. After 6 weeks in vivo, cell and tissue infiltration was present throughout the scaffold. This study describes a novel method of creating porous osteoconductive POC scaffolds without the need for porogen leaching and provides the groundwork for applying LPF to other elastomers and composites.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "New insights into the biological effects of anthrax toxins: linking cellular to organismal responses.", "abstract": "The anthrax toxins lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) are essential virulence factors produced by Bacillus anthracis. These toxins act during two distinct phases of anthrax infection. During the first, prodromal phase, which is often asymptomatic, anthrax toxins act on cells of the immune system to help the pathogen establish infection. Then, during the rapidly progressing (or fulminant) stage of the disease bacteria disseminate via a hematological route to various target tissues and organs, which are typically highly vascularized. As bacteria proliferate in the bloodstream, LT and ET begin to accumulate rapidly reaching a critical threshold level that will cause death even when the bacterial proliferation is curtailed by antibiotics. During this final phase of infection the toxins cause an increase in vascular permeability and a decrease in function of target organs including the heart, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain. In this review, we examine the various biological effects of anthrax toxins, focusing on the fulminant stage of the disease and on mechanisms by which the two toxins may collaborate to cause cardiovascular collapse. We discuss normal mechanisms involved in maintaining vascular integrity and based on recent studies indicating that LT and ET cooperatively inhibit membrane trafficking to cell-cell junctions we explore several potential mechanisms by which the toxins may achieve their lethal effects. We also summarize the effects of other potential virulence factors secreted by B. anthracis and consider the role of toxic factors in the evolutionarily recent emergence of this devastating disease.", "journal": "Microbes and infection", "date": "2011-09-21", "authors": ["AnnabelGuichard", "VictorNizet", "EthanBier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2011.08.016"}
{"title": "Nd-YAG laser treatment of primary and recurrent pilonidal sinus.", "abstract": "A pilonidal sinus usually contains hair and extensive vascularization due to inflammation, which theoretically gives Nd-YAG laser waves the potential to destroy the deep fistula systems of the sinus without affecting the overlying skin. We describe our preliminary experience with Nd-YAG laser waves in the treatment of pilonidal sinus. A total of 41 consecutive patients with pilonidal sinus underwent the intended Nd-YAG laser treatment. Structured telephone interviews were carried out in 37 patients (90%). The median duration of treatment and observation time were 5.1 months and 15.2 months, respectively. Three patients (7%) received additional surgery: two had granulomas removed via a minor excision, and one requested more traditional surgery. At follow-up, 28 out of the 37 patients (75.7%) reported freedom from symptoms without supplementary treatment, and 30 (81%) were symptom-free after supplementary laser treatment and minimal surgery, if needed. We have identified a potential treatment for pilonidal sinus that is extremely gentle compared with conventional surgery. We aim to substantially increase the cohort of patients undergoing this treatment and follow up these patients with a register-based technique with a comparable control group. The Nd-YAG laser may prove to be an attractive treatment alternative for pilonidal sinus.", "journal": "Lasers in medical science", "date": "2011-09-20", "authors": ["Christine SLindholt-Jensen", "Jes SLindholt", "MaleneBeyer", "Jan SLindholt"], "doi": "10.1007/s10103-011-0990-2"}
{"title": "A processing work-flow for measuring erythrocytes velocity in extended vascular networks from wide field high-resolution optical imaging data.", "abstract": "Comprehensive information on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vascular response is needed to underpin the signals used in hemodynamics-based functional imaging. It has recently been shown that red blood cells (RBCs) velocity and its changes can be extracted from wide-field optical imaging recordings of intrinsic absorption changes in cortex. Here, we describe a complete processing work-flow for reliable RBC velocity estimation in cortical networks. Several pre-processing steps are implemented: image co-registration, necessary to correct for small movements of the vasculature, semi-automatic image segmentation for fast and reproducible vessel selection, reconstruction of RBC trajectories patterns for each micro-vessel, and spatio-temporal filtering to enhance the desired data characteristics. The main analysis step is composed of two robust algorithms for estimating the RBCs' velocity field. Vessel diameter and its changes are also estimated, as well as local changes in backscattered light intensity. This full processing chain is implemented with a software suite that is freely distributed. The software uses efficient data management for handling the very large data sets obtained with in vivo optical imaging. It offers a complete and user-friendly graphical user interface with visualization tools for displaying and exploring data and results. A full data simulation framework is also provided in order to optimize the performances of the algorithm with respect to several characteristics of the data. We illustrate the performance of our method in three different cases of in vivo data. We first document the massive RBC speed response evoked by a spreading depression in anesthetized rat somato-sensory cortex. Second, we show the velocity response elicited by a visual stimulation in anesthetized cat visual cortex. Finally, we report, for the first time, visually-evoked RBC speed responses in an extended vascular network in awake monkey extrastriate cortex.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2011-09-20", "authors": ["ThomasDeneux", "SylvainTakerkart", "AmiramGrinvald", "Guillaume SMasson", "IvoVanzetta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.081"}
{"title": "Melatonin prevents human pancreatic carcinoma cell PANC-1-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor expression.", "abstract": "Melatonin is an important natural oncostatic agent, and our previous studies have found its inhibitory action on tumor angiogenesis, but the mechanism remains unclear. It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays key roles in tumor angiogenesis and has become an important target for antitumor therapy. Pancreatic cancer is a representative of the most highly vascularized and angiogenic solid tumors, which responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, seeking new treatment strategies targeting which have anti-angiogenic capability is urgent in clinical practice. In this study, a co-culture system between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and pancreatic carcinoma cells (PANC-1) was used to investigate the direct effect of melatonin on the tumor angiogenesis and its possible action on VEGF expression. We found HUVECs exhibited an increased cell proliferation and cell migration when co-cultured with PANC-1 cells, but the process was prevented when melatonin added to the incubation medium. Melatonin at concentrations of 1\u2003\u03bcm and 1\u2003mm inhibited the cell proliferation and migration of HUVECs and also decreased both the VEGF protein secreted to the cultured medium and the protein produced by the PANC-1 cells. In addition, the VEGF mRNA expression was also down-regulated by melatonin. Taken together, our present study shows that melatonin at pharmacological concentrations inhibited the elevated cell proliferation and cell migration of HUVECs stimulated by co-culturing them with PANC-1 cells; this was associated with a suppression of VEGF expression in PANC-1 cells.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2011-09-15", "authors": ["PeilinCui", "MinghuaYu", "XingchunPeng", "LvDong", "ZhaoxuYang"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-079X.2011.00933.x"}
{"title": "Overview: studying integrins in vivo.", "abstract": "Integrins are adhesive proteins that have evolved to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix communication that is indispensable for development and postnatal physiology. Despite their widespread expression, the genetic deletion of specific integrin family members in lower organisms as well as mammals leads to relatively distinct abnormalities. Many of the processes in which integrins participate have a requirement for strong adhesion coincident with times of mechanical stress. In Drosophila, the absence of specific integrins leads to detachment of muscle from the gut and body wall and separation of the two epithelial layers in the wing. In mice and humans, a deletion of either subunit of the laminin-binding integrin, \u03b16\u03b24 leads to severe skin blistering and defects in other epithelial layers. In addition, integrins have also evolved to serve more subspecialized roles ranging from the establishment of a stem cell niche in Drosophila and mammals, to the regulation of pathogenic tumor vascularization, platelet adhesion, and leukocyte transmigration in mammalian systems. However, some cells seem to function normally in the absence of all integrins, as revealed by the very surprising finding that deletion of all the major integrin types on dendritic cells of mice has no effect on the ability of these cells to migrate within the interstitium of the skin and enter into lymphatics. In addition to serving as transmembrane mechanical links, integrins in vertebrates synergize with a number of receptors including growth factor receptors, to enhance responses. This leads to the activation of a large signaling network that affects cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as cell shape and migration. In vivo studies, in lower organisms, knockout mouse models as well as in inherited human diseases together have provided important insights into how this major, primordial family of adhesion receptors have remained true to their name \"integrins\" as their diverse functions have in common the ability to integrate extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals that affect cell behavior.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2011-09-13", "authors": ["Clifford ALowell", "Tanya NMayadas"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-61779-166-6_22"}
{"title": "Acceleration of clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in mice following bevacizumab/Avastin treatment: the role of CXCL cytokines.", "abstract": "The anti-VEGF targeted antibody bevacizumab (BVZ) has been approved for treating renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Although BVZ increases the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic RCC, the effect on overall survival is poor. To gain insight into the limited efficacy of BVZ on overall survival, we analyzed patient samples of RCC for angiogenic factors that may participate in escape from anti-VEGF therapy. Our study shows that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumors was increased compared with normal tissue. The level of interleukin-8/CXCL8, a pro-angiogenic member of the CXCL family of cytokines, was also increased in tumors. These observations gave us a good reason to analyze the combined effects of BVZ and anti-CXCL8 antibodies on tumor growth. Surprisingly, we report that BVZ accelerates the growth of RCC in nude mice with in vivo selection of tumor cells with an increased growth capacity. Downregulation of receptor tyrosine phosphatase-\u03ba, a phosphatase implicated in EGF receptor regulation, may partly explain this phenomenon. Modification of the vascular network and development of lymphatic vessels through VEGF-C production and compensatory production of pro-angiogenic CXCL cytokines were also observed. The apparent normalization of the vascular network prompted us to associate BVZ with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. While efficient in vitro, paclitaxel did not reverse the anti-VEGF effects in vivo. Anti-CXCL8-targeting antibodies were promising as they decreased intra-tumor VEGF production; decreased the pro-angiogenic CXCL/anti-angiogenic CXCL ratio and did not induce lymphangiogenesis. These observations hold clinical implication as they highlight putative markers implicated in escape from BVZ treatment. They also recommend proceeding with caution in the use of anti-VEGF therapy alone for treatment of RCC.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-09-13", "authors": ["RGrepin", "MGuyot", "MJacquin", "JDurivault", "EChamorey", "ASudaka", "CSerdjebi", "BLacarelle", "J-YScoazec", "SNegrier", "HSimonnet", "GPages"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.360"}

{"title": "Human adipose tissue extract induces angiogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro.", "abstract": "The induction of adequate vascularization, a major challenge in tissue engineering, has been tried with numerous methods but with unsatisfactory results. Adipose tissue, an active endocrine organ with dense vasculature, secretes a wide number of angiogenic and adipogenic factors and seems an attractive source for these bioactive factors. We produced a novel cell-free extract from mature human adipose tissue (adipose tissue extract [ATE]) and analyzed the ability of this extract to induce angiogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and studied the cytokine and growth factor composition of ATE with ELISA and cytokine array. We demonstrate that ATE, when added as cell culture supplement, effectively induced triglyceride accumulation in human adipose stem cells at concentrations from 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward in less than a week and caused elevated levels of adipocyte differentiation markers (proliferator-activated receptor gamma and acyl-CoA-binding protein) when treated with at least 350\u2009\u03bcg/mL of ATE. ATE induced angiogenesis from 450\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward after a week in vitro. ATE contained numerous angiogenic and adipogenic factors, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-6, adiponectin, angiogenin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor-I, as well as lower levels of a wide variety of other cytokines. We here present a novel cell-free angiogenesis- and adipogenesis-inducing agent that is cell-free and easy to produce, and its effect is dose dependent and its composition can be easily modified. Therefore, ATE is a promising novel agent to be used for angiogenesis induction to overcome the challenge of vascularization and for adipogenesis induction in a wide variety of tissue engineering applications in vitro and in vivo.

The following parameters were evaluated: gestational age at diagnosis, side of the diaphragmatic defect, presence of polyhydramnios, presence of liver herniated into the fetal thorax (liver-up), lung-to-head ratio (LHR) and observed/expected LHR (o/e-LHR), observed/expected contralateral and total fetal lung volume (o/e-ContFLV and o/e-TotFLV) ratios, ultrasonographic fetal lung volume/fetal weight ratio (US-FLW), observed/expected contralateral and main pulmonary artery diameter (o/e-ContPA and o/e-MPA) ratios and the contralateral vascularization index (Cont-VI).

{"title": "Sustaining neovascularization of a scaffold through staged release of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and platelet-derived growth factor-BB.", "abstract": "Tissue regeneration into a three-dimensional scaffold requires the stimulation of blood vessel ingrowth. We have employed a freely interconnecting porous scaffold developed by us to determine the utility of a covalently bound heparin surface coating for the delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) in vivo. The heparin surface was shown to release VEGF far more rapidly than PDGF-BB in vitro (VEGF: 75\u2009ng/h for 24\u2009h; PDGF-BB: 86\u2009pg/h for >7 days). In rat subcutaneous implants, at 10 days the heparin surface alone increased vessel ingrowth substantially (p<0.05 vs. unmodified scaffold), release of VEGF resulted in a further increase (p<0.05 vs. heparinized scaffold), whereas PDGF-BB had no additional effect. The increase induced by the combination of growth factors was similar to VEGF alone. After 2 months, PDGF-BB, but not VEGF delivery, resulted in a substantial increase in vascularization above that induced by heparin (p<0.05). At the longer time point the combination of growth factors was similar to PDGF-BB. However, only the combination of growth factors significantly elevated the number of ingrowing arterioles (p<0.05 vs. heparinized scaffold). Thus, the covalent modification of a porous scaffold with heparin allows for the differential release of VEGF and PDGF-BB that results in both a rapid and sustained increase in scaffold vascularization.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Importantly, all initial steps of disease progression were recapitulated, including the incorporation of the tumor cells into their physiological microenvironment, transition of radial to vertical growth, and establishment of highly vascularized, aggressive tumors with dermal involvement. Because all cellular components can be individually accessed using this approach, it allows manipulation of the tumor cells, as well as of the keratinocyte and stromal cell populations.

A previous study determined that rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) delivered on the surface of small (\u223c0.8\u2009mm long\u00d70.5\u2009mm diameter) collagen gel cylinders (microtissues, modular tissue engineering) formed vessels after transplantation into immunosuppressed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Although the RAECs formed vessels in this allogeneic transplant model, there was a robust inflammatory response and the vessels that formed were leaky as shown by microcomputed tomography (microCT) perfusion studies. In vitro assays showed that SD rat bmMSCs embedded into the collagen gel modules increased the extent of EC proliferation and enhanced EC sprouting. In vivo, although vessel number was not affected, the new vessels formed by the bmMSCs and RAECs were more stable and leaked less in the microCT perfusion analysis than vessels formed by implanted RAECs alone. Addition of the bmMSCs also decreased the total number of CD68(+) macrophages that infiltrated the implant and changed the distribution of CD163(+) (M2) macrophages so that they were found within the newly developed vascularized tissue. Most interestingly, the bmMSCs became smooth muscle actin positive and migrated to surround the EC layer of the vessel, which is the location typical of pericytes. The combination of these two effects was presumed to be the cause of improved vascularity when bmMSCs were embedded in the EC-coated modules. Further exploration of these observations is warranted to exploit modular tissue engineering as a means of forming large vascularized functional tissues using microtissue components.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

We investigated two different scaffolds for their potential use in adipose tissue regeneration. Sponge-like polyurethane scaffolds were prepared by mold casting with methylal as foaming agent, whereas polycaprolactone scaffolds with highly regular stacked-fiber architecture were fabricated with fused deposition modeling. Both scaffold types were seeded with human adipose tissue-derived precursor cells, cultured and implanted in nude mice using a femoral arteriovenous flow-through vessel loop for angiogenesis. In vitro, cells attached to both scaffolds and differentiated into adipocytes. In vivo, angiogenesis and adipose tissue formation were observed throughout both constructs after 2 and 4\u00a0weeks, with angiogenesis being comparable in seeded and unseeded constructs. Fibrous tissue formation and adipogenesis were more pronounced on polyurethane foam scaffolds than on polycaprolactone prototyped scaffolds.

BCG therapy is the most successful example of immunotherapy in cancer. Unfortunately, the treatment-related side effects are still relevant. Furthermore, non-responder patients are candidate to radical cystectomy in the absence of valuable alternative options. These aspects have prompted the search for newer biological response modifiers (BRM) with a better benefit/side effects ratio. The toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand, Helicobacter pylori protein HP-NAP, has been shown to deserve a potential role as BRM. HP-NAP is capable of driving the differentiation of T helper (Th) 1 cells, both in vitro and in vivo, because of its ability to create an IL-12-enriched milieu. Herein, we report that local administration of HP-NAP decreases tumour growth by triggering tumour necrosis in a mouse model of bladder cancer implant. The effect is accompanied by a significant accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells, within tumour and regional lymph nodes. Noteworthy, HP-NAP-treated tumours show also a reduced vascularization due to the anti-angiogenic activity of IFN-\u03b3 induced by HP-NAP.

{"title": "Ion channels and transporters in cancer. 6. Vascularizing the tumor: TRP channels as molecular targets.", "abstract": "Tumor vascularization is a critical process that determines tumor growth and metastasis. In the last decade new experimental evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies have challenged the classical angiogenesis model forcing us to consider new scenarios for tumor neovascularization. In particular, the genetic stability of tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) has been recently questioned in several studies, which show that TECs, as well as pericytes, differ significantly from their normal counterparts at genetic and functional levels. In addition to such an epigenetic action of tumor microenvironment on endothelial cells (ECs) commitment, the distinct characteristics of TECs could be due to differences in their origin compared with preexisting differentiated ECs. Intracellular Ca(2+) signals are involved at different critical phases in the regulation of the complex process of angiogenesis and tumor progression. These signals are generated by a wide variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Several key components of Ca(2+) signaling including Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, calcium pumps, and mitochondria contribute to the generation, amplitude, and frequency of these Ca(2+) change. In particular, several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium-permeable channels have profound effects on the function of ECs. Because of its multifaceted role in the control of cell function, proliferation, and motility, TRP channels have been suggested as a potential molecular target for control of tumor neovascularization. Since plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels are easily and directly accessible via the bloodstream, they are potential targets for a number of pharmacological and antibody-targeted therapeutic strategies, with specificity being the main limitation. In this review we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of Ca(2+) channels, with specific reference to TRP channels, in tumor vascularization process.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Cell printing and prevascularization of engineered tissues are promising approaches to meet these challenges. However, the printing technologies used in biofabrication must balance the competing parameters of resolution, speed, and volume, which limit the resolution of thicker 3D structures. We suggest that high-resolution conformal printing techniques can be used to print 2D patterns of vascular cells onto biopaper substrates which can then be stacked to form a thicker tissue construct. Towards this end we created 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 300 \u00b5m biopapers to be used as the transferable, stackable substrate for cell printing. 3.6% w/v poly-lactide-co-glycolide was dissolved in chloroform and poured into molds filled with NaCl crystals. The salt was removed with DI water and the scaffolds were dried and loaded with a Collagen Type I or Matrigel. SEM of the biopapers showed extensive porosity and gel loading throughout. Biological laser printing (BioLP) was used to deposit human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a simple intersecting pattern to the surface of the biopapers. The cells differentiated and stretched to form networks preserving the printed pattern. In a separate experiment to demonstrate \"stackability,\" individual biopapers were randomly seeded with HUVECs and cultured for 1 day. The mechanically stable and viable biopapers were then stacked and cultured for 4 days.

During this procedure, the inflamed or necrotic dental pulp is removed and replaced with a synthetic material. However, recent research provides evidence that engineering of dental pulp and dentin is possible by using biologically driven approaches. As tissue engineering strategies hold the promise to soon supersede conventional root canal treatment, there is a need for customized scaffolds for stem cell delivery or recruitment. We hypothesize that the incorporation of dental pulp-derived stem cells with bioactive factors into such a scaffold can promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In this study, we used a cell adhesive, enzyme-cleavable hydrogel made from self-assembling peptide nanofibers to encapsulate dental pulp stem cells. The growth factors (GFs) fibroblast growth factor basic, transforming growth factor \u03b21, and vascular endothelial growth factor were incorporated into the hydrogel via heparin binding. Release profiles were established, and the influence of GFs on cell morphology and proliferation was assessed to confirm their bioactivity after binding and subsequent release. Cell morphology and spreading in three-dimensional cultures were visualized by using cell tracker and histologic stains. Subcutaneous transplantation of the hydrogel within dentin cylinders into immunocompromised mice led to the formation of a vascularized soft connective tissue similar to dental pulp.

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of lapachol or [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl reduced the hemoglobin content in the implants suggesting that reduction of neo-vascularization was caused by lapachol. In the per os treatment only [Bi(Lp)(2)]Cl decreased the hemoglobin content in the implants.

In many cases, repeated osseous exposition and infection may occur. The currently recommended management of affected patients is antibiotic treatment and bony decortication, which is often complicated by soft tissue deficits due to chronic infection. In severe cases osteonecrosis can be managed often only by continuity resections of the mandible. For this purpose, we developed a new surgical procedure, which allows an effective closure of difficult jaw wounds in the lateral mandible. In the last 3 years, 20 patients with BP-associated osteonecrosis of the lower jaw were treated successfully with a modified defect-covering method using a myofascial flap. A mylohyoid muscle flap was detached from mylohyoid line and used to cover the bony defect. During 19 months mean follow-up, 90% of patients were asymptomatic, the oral mucosa was intact, and no exposed bone was observed. In consequence, we are able to demonstrate that a mylohyoid muscle flap provides a reliable wound closure in the lower jaw in patients treated with BPs. Although there are still no consensual therapy guidelines for patients affected by BP-associated ONJ, the results of the presented study provide evidence for an effective surgical therapy with long-term success.

Endothelialized skin equivalents comprising human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) survive significantly longer due to inosculation with the capillaries of the host, but these cells are allogeneic by definition. The aim of this study was to reconstruct an autologous endothelialized skin equivalent by incorporating progenitor or pre-differentiated endothelial cells derived from adipose tissue, easily accessible source for autologous transplantation. Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells were isolated from lipoaspirates and amplified to obtain endothelial progenitor cells, which were subsequently differentiated into endothelial cells. These cells were then seeded along with human fibroblasts into a porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan-chitosan scaffold to obtain an endothelialized dermal equivalent. Then, human keratinocytes give rise to a endothelialized skin equivalent. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate the presence of capillary-like tubular structures in skin equivalents comprising pre-differentiated endothelial cells, but not endothelial progenitor cells. The former expressed both EN4 and von Willebrand factor, and Weibel-Palade bodies were detected in their cytoplasm. This study demonstrates that adipose tissue is an excellent source of autologous endothelial cells to reconstruct endothelialized tissue equivalents, and that pre-differentiation of stem cells is necessary to obtain vasculature in such models.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-07-15", "authors": ["CAuxenfans", "CLequeux", "EPerrusel", "AMojallal", "BKinikoglu", "ODamour"], "doi": "10.1002/term.454"}

Recent development of computer resource has enabled 3D haemodynamic computations in wide-spread arterial network but there are still difficulties in modelling vascular geometry because of noise and limited resolution in medical images. In this paper, an integrated framework to model an arterial network tree for patient-specific computational haemodynamic study is developed. With this framework, 3D vascular geometry reconstruction of an arterial network and quantification of its geometric feature are aimed. The combination of 3D haemodynamic computation and vascular morphology quantification helps better understand the relationship between vascular morphology and haemodynamic force behind 'geometric risk factor' for cardiovascular diseases. The proposed method is applied to an intracranial arterial network to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. The results are compared with the marching-cubes (MC) method. The comparison shows that the present modelling method can reconstruct a wide-ranged vascular network anatomically more accurate than the MC method, particularly in peripheral circulation where the image resolution is low in comparison to the vessel diameter, because of the recognition of an arterial network connectivity based on its centreline.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2011-07-09", "authors": ["RyoTorii", "MarieOshima"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2011.554407"}

Five days after AI, 32 animals were randomly assigned to a control, intravaginal progesterone for 14 days progesterone releasing intravaginal device (PRID) or GnRH treatment group. On days 5, 7, 12, 14, 17 and 19 post-AI, each animal underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography of the corpus luteum and blood samples were collected for cell counts and plasma progesterone determination. Through general linear model repeated measures analysis of variance, significant effects were observed of treatment, parity, inseminating bull, reduced vascularization of the CL and pregnancy on plasma progesterone concentrations, whereas mean plasma progesterone and time luteal phase day, and treatment and plasma progesterone concentration on day 5 post-AI were found to, respectively, affect neutrophil and lymphocyte counts throughout the luteal phase. Moreover, two binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Based on the odds ratio, the likelihood of pregnancy by days 26-32 post-AI was 23.4 times higher in animals with high mean progesterone levels throughout the study period, compared with animals with low mean progesterone. The likelihood of reduced CL vascularization was 14 times higher in animals treated with PRID, compared with control and GnRH-treated animals. In conclusion, our results indicate that treatment on day 5 post-AI with PRID reduced subsequent CL vascularization, whereas GnRH treatment increased plasma progesterone concentrations on day 12 post-AI, although an effect was identified of the inseminating bull on plasma progesterone levels.

This leads to better positioning and shaping of the reconstructed breast with minimal disruption of the inframammary fold. The purpose of this article was to provide an illustrated approach to the ipsilateral TRAM flap and to clarify the technique when applied in the context of immediate breast reconstruction following cancer extirpation.\nA prospective evaluation of 89 patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction following skin-sparing mastectomy for breast cancer was performed. All patients underwent ipsilateral TRAM reconstruction. The innate insetting advantage of the ipsilateral TRAM flap is illustrated in the article. The key steps of the technique were as follows: (1) The ipsilateral corner of the flap was used as the axillary tail, leaving the more bulky part to form the main body of the breast; (2) To avoid undesirable twists, a right TRAM was rotated clockwise so that its apex points superiorly; (3) This flap was subsequently tunneled into the breast pocket while preserving the inframammary fold. The opposite maneuvers were done for the left side; (4) If the flap was congested, venous augmentation was performed where the tributary of the axillary vein or the thoracodorsal vein was anastomosed with the inferior epigastric vein from the flap with an interposed vein graft (17% of cases).\nAll flaps survived and flap-related complications included partial necrosis of tissue across the midline (2.2%), palpable fat necrosis (22%), and hematoma requiring drainage (2.2%). All flaps were raised concurrent with the resection, and the combined operative time ranged from 3.5 to 6\u00a0h, with a mean hospital stay of 7\u00a0days.\nThe ipsilateral TRAM flap was a reliable flap with low complication rates and short surgery time.

Contrary to osteonecrosis of carpal bones (where vascularized bone grafts have been routinely carried out for decades), reports of analogous procedures at the humeral head are anecdotal.\nBased on selective post-mortem computer-tomographic angiography of 5 and the dissection of 30 embalmed human cadaver shoulders, we describe the anatomy of the acromial branch of the thoracoacromial trunk. The main focus was the constancy of its anatomical course, its dimensions and potential use as a nutrient vessel for a pedicled bone graft from the acromion.\nThe course of the acromial branch revealed a constant topographic relationship to anatomical landmarks. Its terminal branches reliably supplied the anterior part of the acromion.

Potential etiologies include disease- or treatment-related impairment of bone marrow function, or trauma to highly friable and vascularized malignant tissues. Immune impairment may also occur in solid or hematologic malignancies, leading to spontaneous formation of inhibitory antibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Because hemorrhage due to acquired FVIII inhibitors will not respond to conventional treatment algorithms for bleeding, failure to promptly recognize and diagnose this condition may result in undue morbidity and mortality. The persistence of FVIII autoantibodies in the patient with cancer may further complicate necessary invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the short term and lead to lethal bleeding in the long term.

We analyzed the anatomic and morphologic features in 40 fibula bones of 20 cadavers and provided the mean cortical thickness of different transplant sites. Furthermore, we investigated the primary implant stability of dental implants inserted monocortically in harvested fibula segments using established biomechanical methods as well as Periotest(\u00ae). The minimal bone height of the clinically relevant segments of the fibula transplant measured 9.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45 mm, which was assessed in the most distal part.

{"title": "Eosinophilic responses to stent implantation and the risk of Kounis hypersensitivity associated coronary syndrome.", "abstract": "The use of drug eluting stents constitutes a major breakthrough in current interventional cardiology because it is more than halves the need of repeat interventions. It is incontrovertible that coronary stents, in general, have been beneficial for the vast majority of patients. A small increase in thrombosis, following DES implantation, is offset by a diminished risk of complications associated with repeat vascularization. However, late and, especially, very late stent thrombosis is a much feared complication because it is associated with myocardial infarction with increased mortality. Despite that stent thrombosis is thought to be multifactorial, so far clinical reports and reported pathology findings in patients died from coronary stent thrombosis as well as animal studies and experiments, point toward a hypersensitivity inflammation. The stented and thrombotic areas are infiltrated by interacting, via bidirectional stimuli inflammatory cells including eosinophils, macrophages, T-cells and mast cells. Stented regions constitute an ideal surrounding for endothelial damage and dysfunction, together with hemorheologic changes and turbulence as well as platelet dysfunction, coagulation and fibrinolytic disturbances. Drug eluting stent components include the metal strut which contains nickel, chromium, manganese, titanium, molybdenum, the polymer coating and the impregnated drugs which for the first generation stents are: the antimicrotubule antineoplastic agent paclitaxel and the anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative agent sirolimus. The newer stents which are called cobalt-chromiun stents and elute the sirolimus analogs everolimus and zotarolimus both contain nickel and other metals. All these components constitute an antigenic complex inside the coronary arteries which apply chronic, continuous, repetitive and persistent inflammatory action capable to induced Kounis syndrome and stent thrombosis.

Fetal losses occur throughout gestation but cluster in early (~day20) and mid (~day50) pregnancy. Adequate vascularization of the attachment site has emerged as a key factor contributing to fetal success. Since Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF) family members regulate angiogenesis in addition to promoting fetal development and growth, we hypothesized that conceptus success is governed by members of the IGF family. Using quantitative real time PCR, we analyzed expression of IGF family members (IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-I Receptor (IGF-IR), IGF-IIR and their binding proteins, IGFBPs) in matched maternal and fetal tissues of healthy and arresting conceptuses at gestation days (gd) 20 and 50. IGF-II transcripts were 100 fold increased in both maternal and fetal tissues compared to IGF-I, but receptor transcripts were found in similar abundance irrespective of health status and gestation point.

After tissue growth throughout the device, islet isografts were implanted and long-term glucose control was evaluated.\nBy using this technique, 7 of 10 diabetic rat recipients showed long-term normal blood glucose levels after minimal islet dose transplants.

{"title": "Development of a pre-vascularized 3D scaffold-hydrogel composite graft using an arterio-venous loop for tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) and fibrin glue (FG) are effective hydrogels for tissue engineering applications as they support tissue in-growth, retain growth factors, and release them slowly with time. The scaffolds, in combination with a hydrogel, effectuate a successful graft. However, the survival of a graft entirely depends upon a functional vascular supply. Therefore, hydrogels must support the in-growing vasculature. To study and compare the vascular patterns, HA and FG hydrogel-containing PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffolds were implanted in the groin of male Lewis rats and supplied with a micro-surgically prepared arterio-venous (A-V) loop. The rats were perfused with a vascular contrast media after 4 and 8 weeks and sacrificed for further analysis. The specimens were scanned with micro-CT to find the vascular growth patterns. Corrosion casting of blood vessels followed by SEM demonstrated a high vascular density near the parent blood vessels. Histologically, HA and FG implanted animal groups showed significant angiogenetic activity, especially within the pores of the scaffold. However, formation of new blood vessels was more conspicuously observed at 4 weeks in FG than HA implants. Furthermore, by 8 weeks, the number and pattern of blood vessels were comparable between them. At this time, HA was still present indicating its slow degradation. The finding was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis. This experimental study demonstrates that HA containing composite scaffold systems permit stabile in-growth of blood vessels due to sustained degradation over 8 weeks.

{"title": "A modified free muscle transfer technique to effectively treat chronic and persistent calcaneal osteomyelitis.", "abstract": "Successful management of chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis presents a major challenge for the plastic and reconstructive surgeon, especially in cases involving soft-tissue defects. This article describes a modified free muscle transfer technique to effectively eradicate chronic and persistent calcaneal osteomyelitis.\nBetween February 2009 and September 2009, 3 male patients with persistent calcaneal osteomyelitis were treated in our clinic. All 3 had purulent drainage for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 23 years. Multiple surgical debridements and vacuum-assisted closure had been used in the past, but the infection remained. We used a therapeutic protocol of repeated and radical surgical debridement with removal of nearly all cancellous bone and preservation of the cortical shell of the calcaneus. After the final debridement, the bone cavity was plugged by a free gracilis muscle flap from the contralateral side. A meshed split thickness skin graft was applied. Culture-specific antibiotics were administered for 2 weeks.\nAll flaps healed uneventfully except for a minor hematoma that was treated conservatively. All 3 patients were able to return to ambulatory status with regular foot apparel. At last follow-up evaluation, they had no clinical, laboratory, or radiologic signs of osteomyelitis.\nThis modified free muscle transfer technique seems to be successful in managing chronic and persistent calcaneal osteomyelitis. Infected and healthy cancellous bone of the calcaneus is removed to eradicate all possible foci that maintain inflammation. The resulting bony defect after the aggressive surgical debridement is sufficiently filled with a well-vascularized muscle that ensures a good wound healing. We consider this method to be a promising treatment option, which needs to be supported by further cases.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2011-06-11", "authors": ["MojtabaGhods", "RobertGrabs", "ChristianeKersten", "Peter PChatzopoulos", "MenedimosGeomelas"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e31821ee359"}
{"title": "High mobility group box 1 is a novel substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV.", "abstract": "High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a cytokine with a key role in tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that topical application of HMGB1 to skin wounds of mouse models of diabetes enhanced vessel density and accelerated wound healing, suggesting that diabetes may affect endogenous HMGB1 functions. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV/CD26) is a protease whose activity is increased in diabetes and whose inhibition improves glucose tolerance. Since HMGB1 contains potential DPP-IV cleavage sites, we determined whether HMGB1 may be a substrate for DPP-IV and whether DPP-IV-mediated cleavage may alter the biological activity of HMGB1.\nReversed phase HPLC, mass spectrometry and western blot analyses were performed to analyse and identify HMGB1 peptides generated following DPP-IV digestion. HMGB1 angiogenic functions in the presence of DPP-IV were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. HMGB1 protein was detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients before and after treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.\nDPP-IV cleaved HMGB1 at its N-terminal region and affected its angiogenic functions. Specifically, DPP-IV inhibited HMGB1-induced endothelial cell migration and capillary-like structure formation, as well as HMGB1-mediated vascular network formation in Matrigel implants in mice. We had previously found that HMGB1 promoted endothelial cell migration through activation of extracellular regulated kinase signalling pathway. Here we showed that such an effect was abolished in the presence of DPP-IV. Finally, the N-terminal truncated form of HMGB1 was detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, in whom DPP-IV inhibitors enhanced the levels of full-length HMGB1.\nDPP-IV cleaves HMGB1 and, via this mechanism, inhibits HMGB1 angiogenic activity.

{"title": "Non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma induces angiogenesis through reactive oxygen species.", "abstract": "Vascularization plays a key role in processes such as wound healing and tissue engineering. Non-thermal plasma, which primarily produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), has recently emerged as an efficient tool in medical applications including blood coagulation, sterilization and malignant cell apoptosis. Liquids and porcine aortic endothelial cells were treated with a non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma in vitro. Plasma treatment of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-free medium increased ROS concentration in a dose-dependent manner, with a higher concentration observed in serum-free medium compared with PBS. Species concentration inside cells peaked 1 h after treatment, followed by a decrease 3 h post treatment. Endothelial cells treated with a plasma dose of 4.2 J cm(-2) had 1.7 times more cells than untreated samples 5 days after plasma treatment. The 4.2 J cm(-2) plasma dose increased two-dimensional migration distance by 40 per cent compared with untreated control, while the number of cells that migrated through a three-dimensional collagen gel increased by 15 per cent. Tube formation was also enhanced by plasma treatment, with tube lengths in plasma-treated samples measuring 2.6 times longer than control samples. A fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) neutralizing antibody and ROS scavengers abrogated these angiogenic effects. These data indicate that plasma enhanced proliferation, migration and tube formation is due to FGF-2 release induced by plasma-produced ROS.

The stimulation of cell-cell adhesion molecules was paralleled by a dose-dependent increase of adhesion of CML cells to a HUVEC monolayer. We further showed that the treatment with exosomes from CML cells caused an increase in endothelial cell motility accompanied by a loss of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin from the endothelial cell surface. Functional characterization of exosomes isolated from CML patients confirmed the data obtained with exosomes derived from CML cell line. CML exosomes caused reorganization into tubes of HUVEC cells cultured on Matrigel.

Microvascular free-tissue reconstruction is an important surgical option with the superiority of free muscle and myocutaneous flaps being explored by various publications. Muscle flaps provide good quality vascularized tissue which can be contoured into defects, but their bulk can often lead to the reconstruction having a suboptimal aesthetic outcome. This result is usually most evident in the lower third of the tibia. We present our series of free radial forearm fasciocutaneous flaps for reconstruction of distal third tibial soft-tissue defects following debridement of osteomyelitic foci and bony stabilization.\nA retrospective case-note review of 20 patients treated with free radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap reconstruction of distal third tibial soft-tissue defects following excision of osteomyelitis and adjacent scar tissue, and bony stabilization between January 1999 and December 2006 was conducted.\nThere were 20 patients who had established osteomyelitis of the distal third of tibia following previous open fractures. The mean size of the soft-tissue defect at the time of the free fasciocutaneous flap procedure was 72.3 cm(2) and the mean bony defect was 3.4 cm. The mean duration of the procedure was 417 minutes and flap ischemia time did not extend beyond 60 minutes in any of the cases. Overall flap survival was 100% and all patients had radiologic bony union at a mean of 5.73 months. The average period of follow-up was 22.5 (range, 19-36) months, and none of the patients had a recurrence of the disease during the follow-up period.\nFree fasciocutaneous flap reconstruction for soft-tissue defects of the lower limb in our series was seen to be safe, reliable, and provided an aesthetic outcome with high patient satisfaction rates.

{"title": "Craniopharyngioma: a pathologic, clinical, and surgical review.", "abstract": "Craniopharyngioma is a rare and mostly benign epithelial tumor of the sellar and suprasellar region. Two principal patterns of craniopharyngioma are recognized: papillary and adamantinomatous. Papillary craniopharyngiomas are encountered in adults and may lack the cystic spaces filled with \"motor oil\" as well as the palisading peripheral rows of epithelial cells, keratinization, or calcification typical of pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Secondary to their anatomic location, craniopharyngiomas may present with endocrinologic dysfunction and visual disturbances. Differential diagnosis includes Rathke's cleft cyst, pituitary adenoma, dermoid/epidermoid cysts, and other rare sellar/suprasellar lesions as pituicytomas. Many controversies exist concerning the preferred surgical approach for these tumors. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is no longer reserved only for sellar or small cystic suprasellar lesions. Prechiasmatic/preinfundibular lesions are effectively removed using an endonasal transtuberculum/transplanum approach; subchiasmatic/transinfundibular tumors require the addition of a transellar approach with inferior pituitary transposition; and retrochiasmatic/retroinfundibular lesions are better accessed performing an endonasal superior pituitary transposition. Compared with well-established trancranial approaches (pterional, subfrontal, presigmoid), endoscopic endonasal surgery combines the virtues of the caudocranial and midline approaches, allowing for appropriate infrachiasmatic exposure without the need for manipulation of surrounding neurovascular structures to access the tumor. This anatomic advantage, combined with high-definition wide-angle visualization, exquisite endonasal microsurgical techniques, and devoted instrumentation facilitates a high rate of endocrine function preservation and visual improvement, while concurrently achieving comparable resections. Endoscopic skull base reconstruction with the vascularized nasoseptal flap has dramatically reduced the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak, consolidating endoscopic endonasal surgery as an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of these challenging tumors.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2011-05-18", "authors": ["Juan CFernandez-Miranda", "Paul AGardner", "Carl HSnyderman", "Kenneth ODevaney", "Primo\u017eStrojan", "CarlosSu\u00e1rez", "Eric MGenden", "AlessandraRinaldo", "AlfioFerlito"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.21771"}

Because glucose utilization is higher in malignant cells than that in normal cells, dynamic glucose metabolism of tumor has been evaluated by means of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). To investigate the significance of tumor vascularization in oral squamous cell carcinoma, we compared tumor angiogenesis with the FDG-PET findings. Twenty patients underwent FDG-PET. For the quantitative evaluation of FDG uptake in each tumor, the mean standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated. Microvessel structures labeled with CD34 antigen were investigated in pretreatment biopsy specimens. Using an image analyzer, we calculated the following microvessel parameters: the ratio of the total number of microvessels (TN) to tumor area (TA), the ratio of the total microvessel perimeter (TP) to the TA, and the ratio of the tumor tissue area more than 150 \u03bcm distant from each microvessel (hypoxic ratio, %). The SUV was compared with the above parameters. Simple regression analysis revealed a statistical significance between the SUV and the TN:TA ratio (p = 0.046), as well as between the SUV and the TP:TA ratio (p = 0.0206). The SUV was found to be inversely related to the TN:TA and TP:TA ratios. Elevated glucose metabolism assessed by FDG-PET correlated with reduced vascularization.

CXCL14 expression is constitutive in normal tissues, but absent in wide range of epithelial tumors. Many reports have claimed its important role in tumorigenesis and vascularization. An association between rs2237062 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility was found in patients with chronic HCV infection in Japanese population. Here we analyzed, by using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR), the polymorphism in 202 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, 361 HBV-related HCC patients and 407 healthy controls. The aim was to detect the possible association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with HBV-related HCC susceptibility and progression. However, no association was found between rs2237062 polymorphism and susceptibility to HBV infection or HBV-related HCC. Intriguingly, our stratification analysis revealed that HBV-related HCC patients in advanced phase (TNM-II-IV stage) had significantly higher C allele frequency at this polymorphism than patients at early stage (TNM-I stage) (33.5% vs. 25.7%), and its odds ratio reached 1.47 (95% CI 1.06-2.04, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).

In the world of cell therapies, undoubtedly, mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue are the most promising progenitors for tissue engineering applications. In this setting, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are generally similar to those derived from bone marrow and are most conveniently extracted from tissue removed by elective cosmetic liposuction procedures; they also show a great potential for endothelization. The aim of the present work was to investigate how the cocommitment into a vascular and bone phenotype of ASCs could be a useful tool for improving the in vitro and in vivo reconstruction of a vascularized bone graft. Human ASCs obtained from abdominoplasty procedures were loaded in a hydroxyapatite clinical-grade scaffold, codifferentiated, and tested for proliferation, cell distribution, and osteogenic and vasculogenic gene expression. The chromosomal stability of the cultures was investigated using the comparative genomic hybridization array for 3D cultures. ASC adhesion, distribution, proliferation, and gene expression not only demonstrated a full osteogenic and vasculogenic commitment in vitro and in vivo, but also showed that endothelization strongly improves their osteogenic commitment.

Augmented proliferation within regenerated endogenous islets and associated vascular endothelium indicated the induction of islet-specific proliferative and pro-angiogenic programs. Although cultured MSC from independent human BM samples showed variable capacity to improve islet function, and prolonged expansion diminished hyperglycemic recovery, transplantation of ALDH-purified regenerative MSC reduced hyperglycemia and augmented total beta cell mass by stimulating the formation of small beta cell clusters associated with the ductal epithelium, without evidence of increased islet vascularization or Ngn3(+) endocrine precursor activation.

To study the possible role of Achn in breast cancer, we engineered human MDA-MB-231 cells to stably express enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type Achn (AchnWT), as well as Achn lacking either its nuclear localization signal (AchnNLS) or its nuclear export signal (AchnNES). In in vitro assays, AchnWT and AchnNES, but not AchnNLS, enhanced cell proliferation, lamellipodia formation, and invasive activity and drove expression of the elevated expression of the metastasis-associated proteins MMP-9 and VEGF. To determine if Achn could alter the behavior of human breast cancer cells in vivo, Achn-engineered MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into athymic SCID/Beige mice. AchnWT and AchnNES-expressing tumors displayed enhanced angiogenesis and an approximately 5-fold increase in tumor size relative to either control cells or those expressing AchnNLS. These data suggest that Achn enhances human breast tumor growth and vascularization and that this activity is dependent on nuclear localization.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2011-03-10", "authors": ["RongShao", "Steve JScully", "WeiYan", "BrookeBentley", "JamesMueller", "ChristineBrown", "CarolBigelow", "Lawrence MSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.26015"}
{"title": "Vascularization of prevascularized and non-prevascularized fibrin-based human adipose tissue constructs after implantation in nude mice.", "abstract": "Adipose regeneration strategies have been hampered by the inability to supply an adequate vascular supply following implantation. Vascularization in vitro, also called prevascularization, is a promising method that could promote the vascularization of engineered adipose tissue constructs upon implantation. In this study we compared the ability of prevascularized-to-non-prevascularized fibrin-based human adipose tissue to promote vascularization. Human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and different mixtures (1:1, 1:2 and 1:5) of ASCs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in fibrin at two different densities (1.0 \u00d7 10(6) and 10 \u00d7 10(6) cells/ml) for 7 days. Histological analysis revealed that prevascular structures formed in 1:5 ASC/HUVEC fibrin-based constructs seeded with a total of 10 \u00d7 10(6) cells/ml. These constructs and ASC-only constructs were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice for 7 days and generated lipid-containing grafts. The numbers and densities of blood vessels within the ASC/HUVEC constructs were similar to those of ASC-only constructs. Furthermore, immunostaining studies demonstrated human-derived vasculature within a few of the ASC/HUVEC and ASC-only constructs. A subset of this human-derived vasculature contained erythrocytes, indicating integration with the host vasculature. In conclusion, our study indicated no difference in the rate of vascularization of prevascularized ASC/HUVEC and non-prevascularized ASC-only fibrin-based constructs, suggesting that prevascularization of these fibrin-based constructs does not promote vascularization. Our results further indicated that not only endothelial cells, but also ASCs may contribute to the formation of vascular lumina upon implantation. This finding is interesting, since it demonstrates the possibility of vascularized adipose tissue engineering from a single cell source.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-03-02", "authors": ["FemkeVerseijden", "Sandra JPosthumus-van Sluijs", "Johan Wvan Neck", "Stefan O PHofer", "Steven E RHovius", "Gerjo J V Mvan Osch"], "doi": "10.1002/term.410"}
{"title": "Akt3 controls vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and angiogenesis in ovarian cancer cells.", "abstract": "The PI3 kinase/Akt pathway is commonly deregulated in human cancers, functioning in such processes as proliferation, glucose metabolism, survival and motility. We have previously described a novel function for one of the Akt isoforms (Akt3) in primary endothelial cells: the control of VEGF-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. We sought to determine if Akt3 played a similar role in carcinoma cells. Because the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway has been strongly implicated as a key regulator in ovarian carcinoma, we tested the role of Akt3 in this tumor type. Silencing of Akt3 by shRNA did not cause an overt reduction in mitochondrial gene expression in a series of PTEN positive ovarian cancer cells. Rather, we find that blockade of Akt3, results in smaller, less vascularized tumors in a xenograft mouse model that is correlated with a reduction in VEGF expression. We find that blockade of Akt3, but not Akt1, results in a reduction in VEGF secretion and retention of VEGF protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The reduction in secretion under conditions of Akt3 blockade is, at least in part, due to the down regulation of the resident golgi protein and reported tumor cell marker, RCAS1. Conversely, over-expression of Akt3 results in an increase in RCAS1 expression and in VEGF secretion. Silencing of RCAS1 using siRNA inhibits VEGF secretion. These findings suggest an important role for Akt3 in the regulation of RCAS1 and VEGF secretion in ovarian cancer cells.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2011-02-26", "authors": ["Tiera ALiby", "PerrySpyropoulos", "HaleyBuff Lindner", "JuanitaEldridge", "CraigBeeson", "TienHsu", "Robin CMuise-Helmericks"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.26010"}

Cell-based therapies using expanded DPCs for hair regeneration have been unsuccessful in humans. Two major challenges remain: first, expanded DPCs obtained from adult hair follicles have functional limitations; second, a clinically applicable method is needed for transplanting DPCs. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical DPC transplantation procedure for use in clinical settings. Five clinically applicable transplantation procedures were tested, termed the Pinhole, Laser, Slit, Non-vascularized sandwich (NVS) and Hemi-vascularized sandwich (HVS) methods. Labelled rat dermal papilla tissue was transplanted into rat sole skin, and hair follicle regeneration was evaluated histologically. Regenerated follicles and labelled DPCs were detected for all methods, although some follicles showed abnormal growth, i.e. a cystic or inverted appearance. The HVS method, pioneered here, resulted in significantly larger number of regenerated follicles that were more mature and regular than those observed using the other methods. Moreover, hair growth was detected after expanded adult-derived DPC transplantation using the HVS method. These results suggest that direct contact of epithelial and dermal components and better vascularization/oxygenation of the recipient site are critical for hair regeneration in cell-based therapies.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-02-10", "authors": ["NoriyukiAoi", "KeitaInoue", "HarunosukeKato", "HirotakaSuga", "TakuyaHigashino", "HitomiEto", "KentaroDoi", "JunAraki", "TakuyaIida", "TomoyaKatsuta", "KotaroYoshimura"], "doi": "10.1002/term.400"}

Here, we propose that using soluble phosphate glass (SPG) fibers, incorporated in dense collagen constructs will allow us to control the rate and direction of tissue ingrowth. The idea here was to generate channels with tailored direction using conical phosphate glass fibers. The changing surface area-to-mass ratio of conical fibers will make them to dissolve faster from their narrow ends opening up channels in that direction ahead of any ingrowing cells. In this study, we show that SPG fibers can be manipulated to produce conical shape fibers using graded dissolution. Our result shows that 40 \u00b5m fibers of composition ratio 0.5 (P(2)O(5)):0.25 (CaO):0.25 (Na(2)O) and dissolution time of 8-10 h have a mean reduction in fiber diameter of 8.85 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5m over 19.5 mm fiber length, i.e., a mean rate of 0.5 \u00b5m/mm (n=20) change.

The ability to tune the degradation properties of naturally derived biomaterials has been a popular goal in tissue engineering, yet has often depended on chemical crosslinking. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally derived, collagen-based, bioactive scaffold that has broad clinical success in many therapeutic applications. Two methods for producing multilayer, non-crosslinked SIS constructs were compared in vitro and in vivo. Traditional and cryo SEM, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and a novel enzymatic degradation assay determined that lyophilization produced an open, porous scaffold, in contrast to the collapsed, denser structure of SIS constructs produced using a vacuum press process. The angiogenic responses to lyophilized and vacuum-pressed SIS constructs were evaluated in vivo using a subcutaneous implant assay in mice. Explanted samples were compared after 7 and 21 days using fluorescence microangiography and light microscopy. Capacity of the implant neovasculature was also determined. These experiments revealed that the lyophilized SIS was infiltrated and vascularized more rapidly than the vacuum pressed.

At cut-off point of RI<0.79 the sensitivity was 89.6% and the specificity was 78.8% (positive likelihood ratio 4.22).\nDUS is a useful tool for the detection of abnormal blood flow in inflammatory joints of RA patients.", "journal": "European journal of radiology", "date": "2010-02-09", "authors": ["MCarotti", "FSalaffi", "JMorbiducci", "ACiapetti", "LBartolucci", "SGasparini", "GFerraccioli", "G MGiuseppetti", "WGrassi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.01.005"}
{"title": "Factors affecting survival and usefulness of implants placed in vascularized free composite grafts used in post-head and neck cancer reconstruction.", "abstract": "Bone-containing vascularized grafts have been used successfully to reconstruct post-cancer surgical defects. Dental implants can be placed in these bone-containing grafts to allow implant-supported prosthodontic reconstruction of these patients.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of dental implants used in the rehabilitation of subjects treated with bone-containing vascularized grafts to compare usability of implants placed at the time of reconstruction and after healing.\nA cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine survival rates of implants placed in vascularized bone-containing grafts either immediately at the time of surgical reconstruction or after 3 months healing. Other factors such as graft type, whether radiation therapy was given, and implant type were recorded.\nA total of 41 patients had 145 implants placed in 47 vascularized bone-containing flaps. Increased failure rate of implants was seen in immediately placed implants. There was also a significant increase in the number of osseointegrated implants that were prosthodontically unusable or sub-optimally placed in the immediate placement group. Radiation therapy was associated with a significant increase in failure rate. Modern implant surfaces appeared to perform better than machined/turned surfaces. Graft donor site did not influence implant survival.\nThis study demonstrated the difficulties encountered with immediate placement of dental implants at the time of post-cancer reconstructive surgery.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2009-10-22", "authors": ["Michael RFenlon", "AndrewLyons", "SuzanneFarrell", "KalpeshBavisha", "AvijitBanerjee", "Richard MPalmer"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1708-8208.2009.00250.x"}
