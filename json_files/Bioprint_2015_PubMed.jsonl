{"title": "Costs, Benefits, and Adoption of Additive Manufacturing: A Supply Chain Perspective.", "abstract": "There are three primary aspects to the economics of additive manufacturing: measuring the value of goods produced, measuring the costs and benefits of using the technology, and estimating the adoption and diffusion of the technology. This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated $667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 % of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as $241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 % of the relevant manufacturing industries in the US; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed $4.4 billion in 2020, $16.0 billion in 2025, and $196.8 billion in 2035 it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption.", "journal": "The International journal, advanced manufacturing technology", "date": "2017-07-28", "authors": ["DouglasThomas"], "doi": "10.1007/s00170-015-7973-6\n10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00512.x\n10.1108/17410381011063996\n10.1007/s00170-012-4558-5\n10.1016/j.jmsy.2012.07.004"}

{"title": "3D-printed external light trap for solar cells.", "abstract": "We present a universally applicable 3D-printed external light trap for enhanced absorption in solar cells. The\u00a0macroscopic external light trap is placed at the sun-facing surface of the solar cell and retro-reflects the light that would otherwise escape. The light trap consists of a reflective parabolic concentrator placed on top of a reflective cage. Upon placement of the light trap, an improvement of\u00a015% of both the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency in a thin-film nanocrystalline silicon\u00a0(nc-Si:H) solar cell is measured. The trapped light traverses the solar cell several times within the reflective cage thereby increasing the total absorption in the cell. Consequently, the trap reduces optical losses and enhances the absorption over the entire spectrum. The components of the light trap are 3D printed and made of smoothened, silver-coated thermoplastic. In contrast to conventional light trapping methods, external light trapping leaves the material quality and the electrical properties of the solar cell unaffected. To explain the theoretical operation of the external light trap, we introduce a model that predicts the absorption enhancement in the solar cell by the external light trap. The corresponding calculated path length enhancement shows good agreement with the empirically derived value from the opto-electrical data of the solar cell. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the angle of incidence on the parasitic absorptance to obtain full understanding of the trap performance. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Bony metastases most often arise from breast, prostate and kidney cancer as well as myeloma, in which patient survival is relatively long. Large lytic defects within the pelvis, and especially the acetabular area, necessitate surgical treatment with specially designed prostheses, which significantly improves the patients' quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the indications and early outcomes and describe the surgical technique of implantation of the Lumic prosthesis.\nOver the period 2011-2015, six patients underwent resection of periacetabular area metastases followed by implantation of a Lumic prosthesis in the Orthopedic Department in Brzoz\u00f3w. The surgical procedures and their outcomes were assessed with special regard to pain intensity, physical functioning and mobility of patients. The surgeries were performed from an inverted 'S'-shaped approach with a margin of healthy tissue and acetabula were implanted without cement (in 2 patients) and using bone cement (in 4 patients).\nPost-operative pain intensity was significantly lower (3.4 in a VAS scale) and the patients' physical function improved (65 in Karnofsky scale). There were no intra- or post-operative complications. Deterioration in muscular function associated with the surgical technique was acceptable as the surgery enabled the patients to walk.\n1.

{"title": "The influence of sterilization on nitrogen-included ultrananocrystalline diamond for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "Diamond has shown great potential in different biomedical applications, but the effects of sterilization on its properties have not been investigated. Here, we studied the influence of five sterilization techniques (solvent cleaning, oxygen plasma, UV irradiation, autoclave and hydrogen peroxide) on nitrogen-included ultrananocrystalline diamond. The chemical modification of the diamond surface was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. Different degrees of surface oxidation and selective sp(2) bonded carbon etching were found following all sterilization techniques, resulting in an increase of hydrophilicity. Higher viabilities of in vitro mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and rat cortical neuron cells were observed on oxygen plasma, autoclave and hydrogen peroxide sterilized diamond, which correlated with their higher hydrophilicity. By examination of apatite formation in simulated body fluid, in vivo bioactivity was predicted to be best on those surfaces which have been oxygen plasma treated and lowest on those which have been exposed to UV irradiation. The charge injection properties were also altered by the sterilization process and there appears to be a correlation between these changes and the degree of oxygen termination of the surface. We find that the modification brought by autoclave, oxygen plasma and hydrogen peroxide were most consistent with the use of N-UNCD in biological applications as compared to samples sterilized by solvent cleaning or UV exposure or indeed non-sterilized. A two-step process of sterilization by hydrogen peroxide following oxygen plasma treatment was then suggested.

However, this material hindered the 3D printing process due to undesirable lateral or \"dark\" curing (i.e., in areas not exposed to light from the DMD chip). Well known from its use in sunscreen, another UV filter, oxybenzone, has previously been used in conjunction with TiO2. In this study we hypothesize that combining these two UV filters will result in a synergistic effect that controls cure depth and avoids dark cure. A resin mixture (i.e., polymer, initiator, UV filters) was identified that worked well. The resin was then further characterized through mechanical testing, cure testing, and cytotoxicity testing to investigate its use as a material for bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Results show that the final resin eliminated dark cure as shown through image analysis. Mechanically the new scaffolds proved to be far weaker than those printed from previous resins, with compressive strengths of 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 MPa vs. 36.5 \u00b1 1.6 MPa, respectively. The new scaffolds showed a 90% reduction in elastic modulus and a 74% increase in max strain. These properties may be useful in tissue engineering applications where resorption is required.

In this technique the sacrificial PVA mould, determining the structured pore architecture, was filled with salt crystals to define the random pore regions of the scaffold. After crosslinking the casted polymer the combined PVA-salt mould was dissolved in water. The technique has advantages over previously reported ones, such as automated assembly of the sacrificial mould, and precise control over pore architecture/dimensions by 3D printing parameters. In this study, polydimethylsiloxane and biodegradable poly(\u03f5-caprolactone) were used for fabrication. However, we show that this technique is also suitable for other biocompatible/biodegradable polymers. Various physical and mechanical properties of the dual-pore scaffolds were compared with control scaffolds with either only structured or only random pores, fabricated using previously reported methods. The fabricated dual-pore scaffolds supported high cell density, due to the random pores, in combination with uniform cell distribution throughout the scaffold, and higher cell proliferation and viability due to efficient nutrient/oxygen transport through the structured pores. In conclusion, the described fabrication technique is rapid, inexpensive, scalable, and compatible with different polymers, making it suitable for engineering various large scale organs/tissues.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

The ultimate goal is to achieve the development of functional human organs and tissues, to overcome limitations of organ transplantation created by the lack of organ donors and life-long immunosuppression. We hypothesized a precision medicine approach to human organ fabrication using 3D printed technology, in which the digital volumetric data would be collected by imaging of a patient, i.e. CT or MRI images followed by mathematical modeling to create a digital 3D image. Then a suitable biocompatible material, with an optimal resolution for cells seeding and maintenance of cell viability during the printing process, would be printed with a compatible printer type and finally implanted into the patient. Life-saving operations with 3D printed implants were already performed in patients.

{"title": "3D bioprinted extracellular matrix mimics facilitate directed differentiation of epithelial progenitors for sweat gland regeneration.", "abstract": "Sweat glands perform a vital thermoregulatory function in mammals. Like other skin appendages, they originate from epidermal progenitors. However, they have low regenerative potential in response to injury, and whether adult epidermal progenitors could be specified to differentiate to a sweat gland cell lineage remains largely unexplored. We used bioprinting technology to create a functional in vitro cell-laden 3D extracellular matrix mimics (3D-ECM) with composite hydrogels based on gelatin and sodium alginate because of chemical and structural similarity to ECM components. To achieve specific cell differentiation, mouse plantar dermis and epidermal growth factor were synchronously incorporated into the 3D-ECM mimics to create an inductive niche for epidermal progenitor cells obtained from mice. The biological 3D construct could maintain cell viability, thereby facilitating cell spreading and matrix formation. In vitro data by immunofluorescence and gene expression assay of key cell-surface markers demonstrated that the bioprinted 3D-ECM could effectively create a restrictive niche for epidermal progenitors that ensures unilateral differentiation into sweat gland cells. Furthermore, direct delivery of bioprinted 3D-ECM into burned paws of mice resulted in functional restoration of sweat glands. This study represents the rational design to enhance the specific differentiation of epidermal lineages using 3D bioprinting and may have clinical and translational implications in regenerating sweat glands.\nSweat gland regeneration after injury is of clinical importance but remains largely unsolved because of low regenerative potential and lack of a definite niche. Some studies have shown sweat gland regeneration with gene-based interventions or cell-based induction via embryonic components, but translation to clinic is challenging. The novelty and significance of the work lies in the fact that we design a 3D bioprinted extracellular matrix that provides the spatial inductive cues for enhancing specific differentiation of epidermal lineages to regenerate sweat glands, which is critical for treating deep burns or other wounds. Our studies are encouraging given the overwhelming advantages of our designed 3D bioprinting construct over other cell delivery technology in maintaining high cell proliferation; another interesting finding is that adult tissue components retain a gland lineage-inductive power as embryonic tissue, which can facilitate translation.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-01-10", "authors": ["ShaHuang", "BinYao", "JiangfanXie", "XiaobingFu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.12.039"}

These critical parameters vary widely between the different arteries in the human body, and the ability to engineer vessels of varying sizes could increase capabilities for disease modeling and treatment options. We present an innovative method for producing customizable, tissue engineered, self-organizing vascular constructs by replicating a major structural component of blood vessels - the smooth muscle layer, or tunica media. We utilize a unique system combining 3D printed plate inserts to control construct size and shape, and cell sheets supported by a temporary fibrin hydrogel to encourage cellular self-organization into a tubular form resembling a natural artery. To form the vascular construct, 3D printed inserts are adhered to tissue culture plates, fibrin hydrogel is deposited around the inserts, and human aortic smooth muscle cells are then seeded atop the fibrin hydrogel. The gel, aided by the innate contractile properties of the smooth muscle cells, aggregates towards the center post insert, creating a tissue ring of smooth muscle cells. These rings are then stacked into the final tubular construct. Our methodology is robust, easily repeatable and allows for customization of cellular composition, vessel wall thickness, and length of the vessel construct merely by varying the size of the 3D printed inserts.

In this study, we applied Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods to investigating the bonding mechanism and essence of binders on the HA crystallographic planes for 3DP fabrication bone scaffolds. The cohesive energy densities of binders and the binding energies, PCFs g(r), mechanical properties of binder/HA interaction models were analyzed through the MD simulation. Additionally, we prepared the HA bone scaffold specimens with different glues by 3DP additive manufacturing, and tested their mechanical properties by the electronic universal testing machine. The simulation results revealed that the relationship of the binding energies between binders and HA surface is consistent with the cohesive energy densities of binders, which is PAM/HA>PVA/HA>PVP/HA. The PCFs g(r) indicated that their interfacial interactions mainly attribute to the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds which formed between the polar atoms, functional groups in binder polymer and the Ca, -OH in HA. The results of mechanical experiments verified the relationship of Young\u05f3s modulus for three interaction models in simulation, which is PVA/HA>PAM/HA>PVP/HA. But the trend of compressive strength is PAM/HA>PVA/HA>PVP/HA, this is consistent with the binding energies of simulation. Therefore, the Young\u05f3s modulus of bone scaffolds are limited by the Young\u05f3s modulus of binders, and the compressive strength is mainly decided by the viscosity of binder. Finally, the major reasons for differences in mechanical properties between simulation and experiment were found, the space among HA pellets and the incomplete infiltration of glue were the main reasons influencing the mechanical properties of 3DP fabrication HA bone scaffolds.

{"title": "A simple engineered platform reveals different modes of tumor-microenvironmental cell interaction.", "abstract": "How metastatic cancer lesions survive and grow in secondary locations is not fully understood. There is a growing appreciation for the importance of tumor components, i.e. microenvironmental cells, in this process. Here, we used a simple microfabricated dual cell culture platform with a 500 \u03bcm gap to assess interactions between two different metastatic melanoma cell lines (1205Lu isolated from a lung lesion established through a mouse xenograft; and WM852 derived from a stage III metastatic lesion of skin) and microenvironmental cells derived from either skin (fibroblasts), lung (epithelial cells) or liver (hepatocytes). We observed differential bi-directional migration between microenvironmental cells and melanoma, depending on the melanoma cell line. Lung epithelial cells and skin fibroblasts, but not hepatocytes, stimulated higher 1205Lu migration than without microenvironmental cells; in the opposite direction, 1205Lu cells induced hepatocytes to migrate, but had no effect on skin fibroblasts and slightly inhibited lung epithelial cells. In contrast, none of the microenvironments had a significant effect on WM852; in this case, skin fibroblasts and hepatocytes--but not lung epithelial cells--exhibited directed migration toward WM852. These observations reveal significant effects a given microenvironmental cell line has on the two different melanoma lines, as well as how melanoma effects different microenvironmental cell lines. Our simple platform thus has potential to provide complex insights into different strategies used by cancerous cells to survive in and colonize metastatic sites.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-12-31", "authors": ["ChentianZhang", "Elizabeth MShenk", "Laura CBlaha", "ByungwooRyu", "Rhoda MAlani", "MarioCabodi", "Joyce YWong"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015001"}

With advances in commodity digital fabrication tools, it is now possible to directly print fluidic devices and supporting hardware. 3D printed micro- and millifluidic devices are inexpensive, easy to make and quick to produce. We demonstrate Golden Gate DNA assembly in 3D-printed fluidics with reaction volumes as small as 490 nL, channel widths as fine as 220 microns, and per unit part costs ranging from $0.61 to $5.71.

{"title": "Mechanical properties and shape memory effect of 3D-printed PLA-based porous scaffolds.", "abstract": "In the present work polylactide (PLA)/15wt% hydroxyapatite (HA) porous scaffolds with pre-modeled structure were obtained by 3D-printing by fused filament fabrication. Composite filament was obtained by extrusion. Mechanical properties, structural characteristics and shape memory effect (SME) were studied. Direct heating was used for activation of SME. The average pore size and porosity of the scaffolds were 700\u03bcm and 30vol%, respectively. Dispersed particles of HA acted as nucleation centers during the ordering of PLA molecular chains and formed an additional rigid fixed phase that reduced molecular mobility, which led to a shift of the onset of recovery stress growth from 53 to 57\u00b0C. A more rapid development of stresses was observed for PLA/HA composites with the maximum recovery stress of 3.0MPa at 70\u00b0C. Ceramic particles inhibited the growth of cracks during compression-heating-compression cycles when porous PLA/HA 3D-scaffolds recovered their initial shape. Shape recovery at the last cycle was about 96%. SME during heating may have resulted in \"self-healing\" of scaffold by narrowing the cracks. PLA/HA 3D-scaffolds were found to withstand up to three compression-heating-compression cycles without delamination. It was shown that PLA/15%HA porous scaffolds obtained by 3D-printing with shape recovery of 98% may be used as self-fitting implant for small bone defect replacement owing to SME.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-12-29", "authors": ["F SSenatov", "K VNiaza", "M YuZadorozhnyy", "A VMaksimkin", "S DKaloshkin", "Y ZEstrin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.11.036"}

There are over 50 million people worldwide suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are only a few treatment options available for acute traumatic injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for transplantation. In this commentary, the newly developed 3D bioprinting technique involving neural stem cells (NSCs) embedded in the thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane (PU) bioink is reviewed. The thermoresponsive and biodegradable PU dispersion can form gel near 37 \u00b0C without any crosslinker. NSCs embedded within the water-based PU hydrogel with appropriate stiffness showed comparable viability and differentiation after printing. Moreover, in the zebrafish embryo neural deficit model, injection of the NSC-laden PU hydrogels promoted the repair of damaged CNS. In addition, the function of adult zebrafish with traumatic brain injury was rescued after implantation of the 3D-printed NSC-laden constructs. Therefore, the newly developed 3D bioprinting technique may offer new possibilities for future therapeutic strategy of neural tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Organogenesis", "date": "2015-12-29", "authors": ["Fu-YuHsieh", "Shan-huiHsu"], "doi": "10.1080/15476278.2015.1123360\n10.1002/jcb.24427\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00358-6\n10.1016/j.nano.2010.07.004\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.009\n10.1186/1472-6750-8-39\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1002/jbm.b.31831\n10.1097/WNR.0b013e32832b8be4\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.02.014\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015001\n10.4161/org.26048\n10.4161/org.6.4.12650\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.028\n10.1002/adma.201500762\n10.1039/C4TB00572D\n10.1002/adhm.201400018"}

Nanocoatings previously characterized were prepared by layer-by-layer assembling incorporating PL with marine-origin polysaccharides and were shown to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Within 20 h of incubation, the more sulfated coatings induced the HUVECS to the form tube-like structures accompanied by an increased expression of angiogenic-associated genes, such as angiopoietin-1 and VEGF A. This may be a cost-effective approach to modify 2D/3D constructs to instruct angiogenic cells towards the formation of neo-vascularization, driven by multiple and synergistic stimulations from the PL combined with sulfated polysaccharides.\nThe presence, or fast induction, of a stable and mature vasculature inside 3D constructs is crucial for new tissue formation and its viability. This has been one of the major tissue engineering challenges, limiting the dimensions of efficient tissue constructs. Many approaches based on cells, growth factors, 3D bioprinting and channel incorporation have been proposed. Herein, we explored a versatile technique, layer-by-layer assembling in combination with platelet lysate (PL), that is a cost-effective source of many potent pro-angiogenic proteins and growth factors.

We have used the diametral tensile strength measurement to obtain the mechanical strength and stability of Mg-CS cement; in addition, the cement degradation properties is realized by measuring the releasing amount of Si and Mg ions in the simulated body fluid. The other cell characteristics of hPDLs, such as proliferation, differentiation and mineralization were examined while hPDLs were cultured on specimen surfaces. This study found out the degradation rate of Mg-CS cements depends on the Mg content in CS. Regarding in vitro bioactivity; the CS cements were covered with abundant clusters of apatite spherulites after immersion of 24h, while less apatite spherulites were formatted on the Mg-rich cement surfaces. In addition, the authors also explored the effects of Mg ions on the odontogenesis and angiogenesis differentiation of hPDLs in comparison with CS cement. The proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, odontogenesis-related genes (DSPP and DMP-1), and angiogenesis-related protein (vWF and ang-1) secretion of hPDLs were significantly stimulated when the Mg content of the specimen was increased. The results in this study suggest that Mg-CS materials with this modified composition could stimulate hPDLs behavior and can be good bioceramics for bone substitutes and hard tissue regeneration applications as they stimulate odontogenesis/angiogenesis.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

The regular titanium lattice samples with three different unit cell geometries, namely, diamond, rhombic dodecahedron and truncated cuboctahedron, and the relative density range of 0.1-0.3 were analyzed under uniaxial cyclic compressive loading. A failure event based algorithm was employed to simulate fatigue failure in the cellular material. Stress-life approach was used to model fatigue failure of both bulk (struts) and cellular material. The predicted fatigue life and the damage pattern of all three structures were found to be in good agreement with the experimental fatigue investigations published in the literature. The results also showed that the relationship between fatigue strength and cycles to failure obeyed the power law. The coefficient of power function was shown to depend on relative density, geometry and fatigue properties of the bulk material while the exponent was only dependent on the fatigue behavior of the bulk material.

{"title": "Mechanical properties of regular porous biomaterials made from truncated cube repeating unit cells: Analytical solutions and computational models.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled fabrication of open-cell porous biomaterials based on repeating unit cells. The micro-architecture of the porous biomaterials and, thus, their physical properties could then be precisely controlled. Due to their many favorable properties, porous biomaterials manufactured using AM are considered as promising candidates for bone substitution as well as for several other applications in orthopedic surgery. The mechanical properties of such porous structures including static and fatigue properties are shown to be strongly dependent on the type of the repeating unit cell based on which the porous biomaterial is built. In this paper, we study the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials made from a relatively new unit cell, namely truncated cube. We present analytical solutions that relate the dimensions of the repeating unit cell to the elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling load of those porous structures. We also performed finite element modeling to predict the mechanical properties of the porous structures. The analytical solution and computational results were found to be in agreement with each other. The mechanical properties estimated using both the analytical and computational techniques were somewhat higher than the experimental data reported in one of our recent studies on selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V porous biomaterials. In addition to porosity, the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the porous structures were found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the length of the inclined struts to that of the uninclined (i.e. vertical or horizontal) struts, \u03b1, in the truncated cube unit cell. The geometry of the truncated cube unit cell approaches the octahedral and cube unit cells when \u03b1 respectively approaches zero and infinity. Consistent with those geometrical observations, the analytical solutions presented in this study approached those of the octahedral and cube unit cells when \u03b1 approached respectively 0 and infinity.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

The digital model obtained was converted to a physical replica by 3D printing. This copy was compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the original, using both a classical anthropometric and a 3D surface scanning approach.\nQualitatively, the replica and the original displayed good qualitative concordance. The quantitative deviations, as measured by osteometric tools, lay partly in the submillimetric area, partly between 1 and 2 mm. The maximum difference was 3.7 mm. On the basis of the surface scans, a mean deviation of 0.2930 mm (\u00b10.2677 mm) and a median difference of 0.2125 mm (0.0000-1.5509 mm) were observed for the inner surface.

{"title": "Cloud-Based Automated Design and Additive Manufacturing: A Usage Data-Enabled Paradigm Shift.", "abstract": "Integration of sensors into various kinds of products and machines provides access to in-depth usage information as basis for product optimization. Presently, this large potential for more user-friendly and efficient products is not being realized because (a) sensor integration and thus usage information is not available on a large scale and (b) product optimization requires considerable efforts in terms of manpower and adaptation of production equipment. However, with the advent of cloud-based services and highly flexible additive manufacturing techniques, these obstacles are currently crumbling away at rapid pace. The present study explores the state of the art in gathering and evaluating product usage and life cycle data, additive manufacturing and sensor integration, automated design and cloud-based services in manufacturing.

Because of its high resolution and the ability to print living cells, bioprinting has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ generation as well as microscale living cell deposition. In this paper, we present a low-cost stereolithography-based bioprinting system that uses visible light crosslinkable bioinks. This low-cost stereolithography system was built around a commercial projector with a simple water filter to prevent harmful infrared radiation from the projector. The visible light crosslinking was achieved by using a mixture of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with eosin Y based photoinitiator. Three different concentrations of hydrogel mixtures (10% PEG, 5% PEG\u00a0+\u00a05% GelMA, and 2.5% PEG\u00a0+\u00a07.5% GelMA, all w/v) were studied with the presented systems. The mechanical properties and microstructure of the developed bioink were measured and discussed in detail. Several cell-free hydrogel patterns were generated to demonstrate the resolution of the solution. Experimental results with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells show that this system can produce a highly vertical 3D structure with 50 \u03bcm resolution and 85% cell viability for at least five days.

The maximum stress increases heterogeneity of cell response, induces inelastic ultra-structural distortion of the cell membrane and chromatin, and increases necrotic subpopulations post-printing. The review, analysis and preliminary results support the feasibility of modulating cell properties during fabrication by prescriptively tuning the stress environment.

The resulting cell-laden array with a gradient of GelMA/PEG composition was used to screen human PDLSC response to ECM. The behavior (e.g., cell viability, spreading) of human PDLSCs in GelMA/PEG array were found to be depended on the volume ratios of GelMA/PEG, with cell viability and spreading area decreased along with increasing the ratio of PEG.

We discuss many of the advantages that hydrogels offer as bone repair materials, including their potential for osteoconductivity, biodegradability, controlled growth factor release, and cell encapsulation. We also discuss the use of hydrogels in composite devices with metals, ceramics, or polymers. These composites are useful because of the low mechanical moduli of hydrogels. Finally, the potential for thermosetting and photo-cross-linked hydrogels as three-dimensionally (3D) printed, patient-specific devices is highlighted.

In this study, a new extrusion based bioprinting technique was developed to produce more complex alginate hydrogel structures. This was achieved by dividing the alginate hydrogel cross-linking process into three stages: primary calcium ion cross-linking for printability of the gel, secondary calcium cross-linking for rigidity of the alginate hydrogel immediately after printing and tertiary barium ion cross-linking for long-term stability of the alginate hydrogel in culture medium. Simple 3D structures including tubes were first printed to ensure the feasibility of the bioprinting technique and then complex 3D structures such as branched vascular structures were successfully printed. The static stiffness of the alginate hydrogel after printing was 20.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.62 KPa which was rigid enough to sustain the integrity of the complex 3D alginate hydrogel structure during the printing.

The independent t test showed that no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P>0.05).\n1) The personalized dental implants were manufactured via 3D printing and FDM with a high degree of precision. 2) Errors between the data models of in vitro and in vivo teeth were observed at the same CBCT parameters.\n\u5e94\u75283D\u6253\u5370\u7194\u878d\u6c89\u79ef\uff08FDM\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u79cd\u690d\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u5929\u7136\u7259\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\n\u901a\u8fc7Mimics 15.0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\uff08CBCT\uff09\u626b\u63cf\u76846\u9897\u56e0\u6b63\u7578\u51cf\u6570\u800c\u9700\u62d4\u9664\u7259\uff08\u4f53\u5185\u7259\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u79cd\u690d\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u626b\u63cf\u62d4\u9664\u540e\u7684\u6b63\u7578\u51cf\u6570\u7259\uff08\u4f53\u5916\u7259\uff09\u53ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u79cd\u690d\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Geomagic studio\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6bd4\u8f833\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u504f\u5dee\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\n\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u79cd\u690d\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u4e0e\u4f53\u5185\u7259\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u533a\u57df\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4e3a0.19 mm\u548c\u22120.16 mm\uff0c\u4f53\u5185\u7259\u4e0e\u4f53\u5916\u7259\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u533a\u57df\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4e3a0.14 mm\u548c\u22120.07 mm\uff1b\u4e24\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u72ec\u7acb\u6837\u672c\n1\uff09\u5e94\u75283D\u6253\u5370FDM\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u79cd\u690d\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u826f\u597d\u30022\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570CBCT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u7259\u4e0e\u4f53\u5916\u7259\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "journal": "Hua xi kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Huaxi kouqiang yixue zazhi = West China journal of stomatology", "date": "2015-12-23", "authors": ["NingWang", "JieLi", "XiaolongWang", "GangLiu", "BinLiu"], "doi": "10.7518/hxkq.2015.05.015"}
{"title": "[Application of 3D printing technique in bilateral sagittal split osteotomy].", "abstract": "To investigate the application of osteotomy template manufactured via 3D printing technique in bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO).\nThe patient group consisted of 32 patients (17 males and 15 females) with mandibular hypoplasia who underwent a BSSO setback (Hunsuck modification; 64 splits). The mean age at the time of surgery was 23.5 years (range 1.9-35 years). All patients were scanned using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to create a 3D model of the mandibular, and the osteotomy template of the inner horizontal ramus of mandible bone incision was manufactured via 3D printing technique. All splits underwent operation with or without the osteotomy template by either a young doctor (attending doctor) or a doctor with extensive orthognathic surgery experience (chief doctor). The time it took to perform the mandible bone incision of the inner horizontal ramus of each group was recorded. Postoperative CBCT scan was performed, and the lingual split scale was used to assess the effect of the operation.\nPrimary healing of incisions was observed in all patients, and no serious complications occurred. The time it took to perform the mandible bone incision of the inner horizontal ramus was significantly different in the four groups (F=30.059, P<0.05), and it was longer in the group of the attending doctor without osteotomy template than in the other three groups (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the other groups (P>0.05). Although all splits (n=64) were performed according to the standardized protocol, only 59.38% (38/64) of the fracture lines run according to the Hunsuck's description. By contrast, only 21.88% (14/64) run through the mandibular canal and 18.75% (12/64) was split. The database was analyzed using crosstabs and via Fisher exact test. The split pattern was influenced by the application of an osteotomy template (P<0.05).\nThe application of osteotomy template manufactured via 3D printing technique in BSSO was effective, which enabled the young doctor to complete the operation faster and with good results.\n\u63a2\u8ba83D\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u622a\u9aa8\u5bfc\u677f\u5728\u53cc\u4fa7\u4e0b\u988c\u5347\u652f\u77e2\u72b6\u5288\u5f00\u622a\u9aa8\u672f\uff08BSSO\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002\n\u9009\u62e932\u4f8b\uff08\u753717\u4f8b\uff0c\u597315\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e74\u9f8419~35\u5c81\uff0c\u5e73\u574723.5\u5c81\uff09\u4e0b\u988c\u53d1\u80b2\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cBSSO\uff08Hunsuck\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c64\u4fa7\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u524d\u5747\u8fdb\u884c\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\uff08CBCT\uff09\u626b\u63cf\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa83D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75283D\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa8\u5347\u652f\u5185\u4fa7\u6c34\u5e73\u9aa8\u5207\u53e3\u622a\u9aa8\u5bfc\u677f\u300264\u4fa7\u624b\u672f\u5206\u522b\u7531\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e3b\u6cbb\u533b\u5e08\u6216\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u6b63\u988c\u624b\u672f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u4e3b\u4efb\u533b\u5e08\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u622a\u9aa8\u5bfc\u677f\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u7ec4\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0b\u988c\u5347\u652f\u5185\u4fa7\u6c34\u5e73\u9aa8\u5207\u53e3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u65f6\u3002\u672f\u540e\u590d\u67e5CBCT\u5e76\u6309\u7167LSS\uff08lingual split scale\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u672f\u6548\u679c\u3002\n\u672f\u540e\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u53e3\u5185\u5207\u53e3\u5747\u4e00\u671f\u6108\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u4e25\u91cd\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u3002\u5404\u7ec4\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0b\u988c\u5347\u652f\u5185\u4fa7\u6c34\u5e73\u9aa8\u5207\u53e3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\n3D\u6253\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u622a\u9aa8\u5bfc\u677f\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u5e74\u8f7b\u533b\u5e08\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b8c\u6210BSSO\u3002", "journal": "Hua xi kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Huaxi kouqiang yixue zazhi = West China journal of stomatology", "date": "2015-12-23", "authors": ["ZhenyuQu", "QianWang", "XinFeng", "LanlanSheng", "WeidongMa", "WeiguoQu"], "doi": "10.7518/hxkq.2015.05.014"}

Here, we encountered a patient with PPI in the post-stenotic area of basilar artery (BA) without a plaque, shown by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI). We performed an experiment using a 3D-printed BA model and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) to explore the hemodynamic property of the post-stenotic area and the mechanism of PPI.\n3D-model of a BA stenosis was reconstructed with silicone compound using a 3D-printer based on the source image of HR-MRI. Working fluid seeded with fluorescence particles was used and the velocity of those particles was measured horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, microtubules were inserted into the posterior aspect of the model to measure the flow rates of perforators (pre-and post-stenotic areas). The flow rates were compared between the microtubules.\nA recirculating flow was observed from the post-stenotic area in both directions forming a spiral shape. The velocity of the flow in these regions of recirculation was about one-tenth that of the flow in other regions. The location of recirculating flow well corresponded with the area with low-signal intensity at the time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and the location of PPI. Finally, the flow rate through the microtubule inserted into the post-stenotic area was significantly decreased comparing to others (P<0.001).\nPerforator infarction may be caused by a hemodynamic mechanism altered by stenosis that induces a recirculation flow. 3D-printed modeling and PIV are helpful understanding the hemodynamics of intracranial stenosis.", "journal": "Journal of stroke", "date": "2015-12-22", "authors": ["Bum JoonKim", "HojinHa", "Hyung KyuHuh", "Guk BaeKim", "Jong SKim", "NamkugKim", "Sang-JoonLee", "Dong-WhaKang", "Sun UKwon"], "doi": "10.5853/jos.2015.01445"}
{"title": "Recent and Future Developments in Chest Wall Reconstruction.", "abstract": "Reconstruction following major chest wall resection can be challenging. Conventional methods of using mesh with or without incorporation of methyl methacrylate are slowly being replaced by chest wall reconstruction prosthetic systems that use titanium plates or bars. The most popular systems in use are the titanium STRATOS bars and MatrixRIB plates, which have different systems for securing to the chest wall. In general, these new approaches are user friendly, are more ergonomic, and may avoid certain complications associated with the more conventional methods of reconstruction. However, the successful implantation of these titanium prosthetic systems requires the operator to be familiar with the limitations and potential pitfalls of the process. Follow-up data are only just emerging on the risk factors for implant failure of these prosthetic systems, as well as certain device-specific complications, with fracture failure being increasingly recognized as a significant problem.

{"title": "A novel bioprinting method and system for forming hybrid tissue engineering constructs.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a promising approach to form tissue engineering constructs (TECs) via positioning biomaterials, growth factors, and cells with controlled spatial distribution due to its layer-by-layer manufacturing nature. Hybrid TECs composed of relatively rigid porous scaffolds for structural and mechanical integrity and soft hydrogels for cell- and growth factor-loading have a tremendous potential to tissue regeneration under mechanical loading. However, despite excessive progress in the field, the current 3D bioprinting techniques and systems fall short in integration of such soft and rigid multifunctional components. Here we present a novel 3D hybrid bioprinting technology (Hybprinter) and its capability enabling integration of soft and rigid components for TECs. Hybprinter employs digital light processing-based stereolithography (DLP-SLA) and molten material extrusion techniques for soft and rigid materials, respectively. In this study, poly-ethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly-(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) were used as a model material for soft hydrogel and rigid scaffold, respectively. It was shown that geometrical accuracy, swelling ratio and mechanical properties of the hydrogel component can be tailored by DLP-SLA module. We have demonstrated the printability of variety of complex hybrid construct designs using Hybprinter technology and characterized the mechanical properties and functionality of such constructs. The compressive mechanical stiffness of a hybrid construct (90% hydrogel) was significantly higher than hydrogel itself (\u223c6 MPa versus 100 kPa). In addition, viability of cells incorporated within the bioprinted hybrid constructs was determined approximately 90%. Furthermore, a functionality of a hybrid construct composed of porous scaffold with an embedded hydrogel conduit was characterized for vascularized tissue engineering applications. High material diffusion and high cell viability in about 2.5 mm distance surrounding the conduit indicated that culture media effectively diffused through the conduit and fed the cells. The results suggest that the developed technology is potent to form functional TECs composed of rigid and soft biomaterials.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-12-20", "authors": ["YShanjani", "C CPan", "LElomaa", "YYang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045008"}

Different functional groups can be modified on chitosan surfaces to probe Neuro-2a cell morphology. To prepare chitosan substrates with micro/nano-scaled features, we demonstrated an easy-to-handle method that combined photolithography, inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching, Ag nanoparticle-assisted etching, and solution casting. The results show that Neuro-2a cells preferred to adhere to a flat chitosan surface rather than a nanotextured chitosan surface as evidenced by greater immobilization and differentiation, suggesting that surface topography is crucial for neural patterning. In addition, we developed chitosan substrates with different geometric patterns and flat region depth; this allowed us to re-arrange or re-pattern Neuro-2a cell colonies at desired locations. We found that a polarity-induced micropattern provided the most suitable surface pattern for promoting neural network formation on a chitosan substrate. The cellular polarity of single Neuro-2a cell spreading correlated to a diamond-like geometry and neurite outgrowth was induced from the corners toward the grooves of the structures.

Herein, we assembled function-control modules into cell-laden scaffolds using 3D bioprinting. A customized 3D printer was able to tune the microstructure of printed bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-laden methacrylamide gelatin scaffolds at the micrometer scale. For example, the pore size was adjusted to 282\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032 \u03bcm and 363\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060 \u03bcm. To match the requirements of the printing nozzle, collagen microfibers with a length of 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 \u03bcm were prepared with a high-speed crusher. Collagen microfibers bound bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) with a collagen binding domain (CBD) as differentiation-control module, from which BMP2 was able to be controllably released. The differentiation behaviors of BMSCs in the printed scaffolds were compared in three microenvironments: samples without CBD-BMP2-collagen microfibers in the growth medium, samples without microfibers in the osteogenic medium and samples with microfibers in the growth medium. The results indicated that BMSCs showed high cell viability (>90%) during printing; CBD-BMP2-collagen microfibers induced BMSC differentiation into osteocytes within 14 days more efficiently than the osteogenic medium.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 43 patients receiving posterior lumbar pedicle screw fixation. The experimental group underwent 3D printing guide plate-assisted posterior lumbar pedicle screw fixation, while the control group underwent traditional x-ray-assisted posterior lumbar pedicle screw fixation. After surgery, CT scanning was done to evaluate the accuracy of screw placement according to the Richter standard. RESULTS All patients were followed up for 1 month. The mean time of placement for each screw and the amount of hemorrhage was 4.9\u00b12.1 min and 8.0\u00b111.1 mL in the experimental group while 6.5\u00b12.2 min and 59.9\u00b113.0 mL in the control group, respectively, with significant differences (p<0.05). The fluoroscopy times of each screw placement was 0.5\u00b10.4 in the experimental group, which was significantly lower than that in the control group 1.2\u00b10.7 (p<0.05). The excellent and good screw placement rate was 100% in the experimental group and 98.4% in the control group, without any statistical difference (P>0.05). No obvious complications were reported in either group.

{"title": "A decision-support model for selecting additive manufacturing versus subtractive manufacturing based on energy consumption.", "abstract": "This paper presents a simple computational model for determining whether additive manufacturing or subtractive manufacturing is more energy efficient for production of a given metallic part. The key discriminating variable is the fraction of the bounding envelope that contains material - i.e. the volume fraction of solid material. For both the additive process and the subtractive process, the total energy associated with the production of a part is defined in terms of the volume fraction of that part. The critical volume fraction is that for which the energy consumed by subtractive manufacturing equals the energy consumed by additive manufacturing. For volume fractions less than the critical value, additive manufacturing is more energy efficient. For volume fractions greater than the critical value, subtractive manufacturing is more efficient. The model considers the entire manufacturing lifecycle - from production and transport of feedstock material through processing to return of post-production scrap for recycling. Energy consumed by processing equipment while idle is also accounted for in the model. Although the individual energy components in the model are identified and accounted for in the expressions for additive and subtractive manufacturing, values for many of these components may not be currently available. Energy values for some materials' production and subtractive and additive manufacturing processes can be found in the literature. However, since many of these data are reported for a very specific application, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reliably apply these data to new process-material manufacturing scenarios since, very often, insufficient information is provided to enable extrapolation to broader use. Consequently, this paper also highlights the need to develop improved knowledge of the energy embodied in each phase of the manufacturing process. To be most valuable, users of the model should determine the energy consumed by their manufacturing process equipment on the basis of energy-per-unit-volume of production for each material of interest - considering both alloy composition and form. Energy consumed during machine idle per unit time should also be determined by the user then scaled to specific processing scenarios. Energy required to generate feedstock material (billet, plate, bar, wire, powder) must be obtained from suppliers.", "journal": "Journal of cleaner production", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["J KWatson", "K M BTaminger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.009\n10.1016/j.enpol.2012.02.040\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.109"}

{"title": "Regenerative Approach to Bilateral Rostral Mandibular Reconstruction in a Case Series of Dogs.", "abstract": "Extensive rostral mandibulectomy in dogs typically results in instability of the mandibles that may lead to malocclusion, difficulty in prehension, mastication, and pain of the temporomandibular joint. Large rostral mandibular defects are challenging to reconstruct due to the complex geometry of this region. In order to restore mandibular continuity and stability following extensive rostral mandibulectomy, we developed a surgical technique using a combination of intraoral and extraoral approaches, a locking titanium plate, and a compression resistant matrix (CRM) infused with rhBMP-2. Furthermore, surgical planning that consisted of computed tomographic (CT) scanning and 3D model printing was utilized. We describe a regenerative surgical technique for immediate or delayed reconstruction of critical-size rostral mandibular defects in five dogs. Three dogs had healed with intact gingival covering over the mandibular defect and had immediate return to normal function and occlusion. Two dogs had the complication of focal plate exposure and dehiscence, which was corrected with mucosal flaps and suturing; these dogs have since healed with intact gingival covering over the mandibular defect. Mineralized tissue formation was palpated clinically within 2\u2009weeks and solid bone formation within 3\u2009months. CT findings at 6\u2009months postoperatively demonstrated that the newly regenerated mandibular bone had increased in mineral volume with evidence of integration between the native bone, new bone, and CRM compared to the immediate postoperative CT.

Despite technological advances that have aided planning and execution of these procedures, surgical inaccuracy is not insignificant. One source of error that has not been wholly addressed is that attributable to a human operator. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and accuracy of performing osteotomies robotically in pre-programmed fashion for fibula free flap mandible reconstruction as a method to reduce inaccuracies related to human error. A mandibular defect and corresponding free fibula flap reconstruction requiring six osteotomies were designed on a CAD platform. A methodology was developed to translate this virtual surgical plan data to a robot (KUKA, Augsburgs, Germany), which then executed osteotomies on three-dimensional (3D) printed fibula flaps with the aid of dynamic stereotactic navigation. Using high-resolution computed tomography, the osteotomized segments were compared to the virtually planned segments in order to measure linear and angular accuracy. A total of 18 robotic osteotomies were performed on three 3D printed fibulas. Compared to the virtual preoperative plan, the average linear variation of the osteotomized segments was 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm, and the average angular variation was 4.2 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0.

The use of 3-D printing for generating morphologically biomimetic tissue phantoms based on medical images represents a potentially major advance over existing phantom approaches. Toward the goal of image-defined phantoms, we converted a segmented fundus image of the human retina into a matrix format and edited it to achieve a geometry suitable for printing. Phantoms with vessel-simulating channels were then printed using a photoreactive resin providing biologically relevant turbidity, as determined by spectrophotometry. The morphology of printed vessels was validated by x-ray microcomputed tomography. Channels were filled with hemoglobin (Hb) solutions undergoing desaturation, and phantoms were imaged with a near-infrared hyperspectral reflectance imaging system. Additionally, a phantom was printed incorporating two disjoint vascular networks at different depths, each filled with Hb solutions at different saturation levels. Light propagation effects noted during these measurements\u2014including the influence of vessel density and depth on Hb concentration and saturation estimates, and the effect of wavelength on vessel visualization depth\u2014were evaluated.

The proposed work uses a novel multiresolution topology optimization method to achieve the task. Using a compliance minimization objective, patient-specific bone replacement shapes can be designed for different clinical cases that ensure revival of efficient load transfer mechanisms in the mid-face. In this work, four clinical cases are introduced and their respective patient-specific designs are obtained using the proposed method. The optimized designs are then virtually inserted into the defect to visually inspect the viability of the design . Further, once the design is verified by the reconstructive surgeon, prototypes are fabricated using a 3D printer for validation. The robustness of the designs are mechanically tested by subjecting them to a physiological loading condition which mimics the masticatory activity. The full-field strain result through 3D image correlation and the finite element analysis implies that the solution can survive the maximum mastication of 120 lb. Also, the designs have the potential to restore the buttress system and provide the structural integrity.

In this study, the biosynthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs by both \"conventional heating\" (CH) and \"microwave irradiation\" (MI) methods has been reported. Stable and spherical ZnONPs were produced using zinc nitrate and flesh extract of Rosa canina fruit (rosehip) which was used as a precursor. The flesh extract acts as a reducing and capping agent for generation of ZnONPs. The structural, morphological and colloidal properties of the as-synthesized NPs have been confirmed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). In comparison with the CH method, the MI method has some advantages such as significantly short reaction time (within 8min) owing to the high heating rate and thus the accelerated reaction rate. Both methods led to the synthesis of nearly identical NPs with respect to shape and size according to the results of DLS, XRD and SEM techniques. The possible mechanism for synthesis pathway has been proposed based on FT IR results, XRD patterns, potentiometric data and antioxidant activity. In addition, the antibacterial activity of as-prepared ZnONPs was investigated against several bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. Moreover, the efficacy of ZnONPs to treat cancer cell lines were measured by means of cell viability test via MTT assay in which concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1mg/mL of ZnONPs induced a very low toxicity.

In this study we present the design, modeling, rapid manufacturing and in vitro testing of a composite scaffold aimed at osteochondral repair. The presented composite scaffold stands out for having a functional gradient of density and stiffness in the bony phase, obtained in titanium by means of computer-aided design combined with additive manufacture using selective laser sintering. The chondral phase is obtained by sugar leaching, using a PDMS matrix and sugar as porogen, and is joined to the bony phase during the polymerization of PDMS, therefore avoiding the use of supporting adhesives or additional intermediate layers. The mechanical performance of the construct is biomimetic and the stiffness values of the bony and chondral phases can be tuned to the desired applications, by means of controlled modifications of different parameters.

Hydrogel formulations consisted of a thermoresponsive polymer mixed with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or a hyaluronic acid (HA) cross-linker with a total polymer concentration of 11.3 and 9.1 wt% respectively. These polymer solutions were partially cross-linked before plotting by a chemoselective reaction called oxo-ester mediated native chemical ligation, yielding printable formulations. Deposition on a heated plate of 37 \u00b0C resulted in the stabilization of the construct due to the thermosensitive nature of the hydrogel. Subsequently, further chemical cross-linking of the hydrogel precursors proceeded after extrusion to form mechanically stable hydrogels that exhibited a storage modulus of 9 kPa after 3 hours. Flow and elastic properties of the polymer solutions and hydrogels were analyzed under similar conditions to those used during the 3D-printing process. These experiments showed the ability to extrude the hydrogels, as well as their rapid recovery after applied shear forces.

The microstructure was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and rheological measurement of the PU dispersion. The surface hydrophilicity measurement, infrared spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, mechanical and thermal analyses were conducted in solid state. It was observed that the presence of a small amount of amphiphilic blocks in the soft segment resulted in significant changes in microstructure. When 90 mol % PCL diol and 10 mol % amphiphilic blocks of poly(l-lactide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PLLA-PEO) diol were used as the soft segment, the synthesized PU had a water contact angle of \u223c24\u00b0 and degree of crystallinity of \u223c14%. The dispersion had a low viscosity below room temperature. As the temperature was raised to body temperature (37 \u00b0C), the dispersion rapidly (\u223c170 s) underwent sol-gel transition with excellent gel modulus (G' \u2248 6.5 kPa) in 20 min.

{"title": "Structural and mechanical implications of PMMA implant shape and interface geometry in cranioplasty--A finite element study.", "abstract": "This computational study investigates the effect of shape (defect contour curvature) and bone-implant interface (osteotomy angle) on the stress distribution within PMMA skull implants. Using finite element methodology, 15 configurations--combinations of simplified synthetic geometric shapes (circular, square, triangular, irregular) and interface angulations--were simulated under 50N static loads. Furthermore, the implant fixation devices were modelled and analysed in detail. Negative osteotomy configurations demonstrated the largest stresses in the implant (275 MPa), fixation devices (1258 MPa) and bone strains (0.04). The circular implant with zero and positive osteotomy performed well with maximum observed magnitudes of--implant stress (1.2 MPa and 1.2 MPa), fixation device stress (11.2 MPa and 2.2 MPa), bone strain (0.218e-3 and 0.750e-4). The results suggest that the preparation of defect sites is a critical procedure. Of the greatest importance is the angle at which the edges of the defect are sawed. If under an external load, the implant has no support from the interface and the stresses are transferred to the fixation devices. This can endanger their material integrity and lead to unphysiological strains in the adjacent bone, potentially compromising the bone morphology required for anchoring. These factors can ultimately weaken the stability of the entire implant assembly.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["AngelaRidwan-Pramana", "PetrMarci\u00e1n", "LiborBor\u00e1k", "NathanielNarra", "TimForouzanfar", "JanWolff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2015.10.014"}
{"title": "Mesoscopic Fluorescence Molecular Tomography for Evaluating Engineered Tissues.", "abstract": "Optimization of regenerative medicine strategies includes the design of biomaterials, development of cell-seeding methods, and control of cell-biomaterial interactions within the engineered tissues. Among these steps, one paramount challenge is to non-destructively image the engineered tissues in their entirety to assess structure, function, and molecular expression. It is especially important to be able to enable cell phenotyping and monitor the distribution and migration of cells throughout the bulk scaffold. Advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques are commonly employed to perform such tasks; however, they are limited to superficial examination of tissue constructs. Therefore, the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine would greatly benefit from the development of molecular imaging techniques which are capable of non-destructive imaging of three-dimensional cellular distribution and maturation within a tissue-engineered scaffold beyond the limited depth of current microscopic techniques. In this review, we focus on an emerging depth-resolved optical mesoscopic imaging technique, termed laminar optical tomography (LOT) or mesoscopic fluorescence molecular tomography (MFMT), which enables longitudinal imaging of cellular distribution in thick tissue engineering constructs at depths of a few millimeters and with relatively high resolution. The physical principle, image formation, and instrumentation of LOT/MFMT systems are introduced.

Parameters such as Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), Cerebral Blood volume (CBV) and Mean Transit Time (MTT) are used to distinguish the tissue infarct core and ischemic penumbra. Due to lack of standardization these parameters vary significantly between vendors and software even when provided with the same data set. There is a critical need to standardize the systems and make them more reliable. We have designed a uniform phantom to test and verify the perfusion systems. We implemented a flow loop with different flow rates (250, 300, 350 ml/min) and injected the same amount of contrast. The images of the phantom were acquired using a Digital Angiographic system. Since this phantom is uniform, projection images obtained using DSA is sufficient for initial validation. To validate the phantom we measured the contrast concentration at three regions of interest (arterial input, venous output, perfused area) and derived time density curves (TDC). We then calculated the maximum slope, area under the TDCs and flow. The maximum slope calculations were linearly increasing with increase in flow rate, the area under the curve decreases with increase in flow rate. There was 25% error between the calculated flow and measured flow. The derived TDCs were clinically relevant and the calculated flow, maximum slope and areas under the curve were sensitive to the measured flow.

{"title": "Strength reliability and in vitro degradation of three-dimensional powder printed strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds.", "abstract": "Strontium ions (Sr(2+)) are known to prevent osteoporosis and also encourage bone formation. Such twin requirements have motivated researchers to develop Sr-substituted biomaterials for orthopaedic applications. The present study demonstrates a new concept of developing Sr-substituted Mg3(PO4)2 - based biodegradable scaffolds. In particular, this work reports the fabrication, mechanical properties with an emphasis on strength reliability as well as in vitro degradation of highly biodegradable strontium-incorporated magnesium phosphate cements. These implantable scaffolds were fabricated using three-dimensional powder printing, followed by high temperature sintering and/or chemical conversion, a technique adaptable to develop patient-specific implants. A moderate combination of strength properties of 36.7MPa (compression), 24.2MPa (bending) and 10.7MPa (tension) were measured. A reasonably modest Weibull modulus of up to 8.8 was recorded after uniaxial compression or diametral tensile tests on 3D printed scaffolds. A comparison among scaffolds with varying compositions or among sintered or chemically hardened scaffolds reveals that the strength reliability is not compromised in Sr-substituted scaffolds compared to baseline Mg3(PO4)2. The micro-computed tomography analysis reveals the presence of highly interconnected porous architecture in three-dimension with lognormal pore size distribution having median in the range of 17.74-26.29\u03bcm for the investigated scaffolds. The results of extensive in vitro ion release study revealed passive degradation with a reduced Mg(2+) release and slow but sustained release of Sr(2+) from strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds. Taken together, the present study unequivocally illustrates that the newly designed Sr-substituted magnesium phosphate scaffolds with good strength reliability could be used for biomedical applications requiring consistent Sr(2+)- release, while the scaffold degrades in physiological medium.\nThe study investigates the additive manufacturing of scaffolds based on different strontium-substituted magnesium phosphate bone cements by means of three-dimensional powder printing technique (3DPP). Magnesium phosphates were chosen due to their higher biodegradability compared to calcium phosphates, which is due to both a higher solubility as well as the absence of phase changes (to low soluble hydroxyapatite) in vivo. Since strontium ions are known to promote bone formation by stimulating osteoblast growth, we aimed to establish such a highly degradable magnesium phosphate ceramic with an enhanced bioactivity for new bone ingrowth. After post-processing, mechanical strengths of up to 36.7MPa (compression), 24.2MPa (bending) and 10.7MPa (tension) could be achieved. Simultaneously, the failure reliability of those bioceramic implant materials, measured by Weibull modulus calculations, were in the range of 4.3-8.8. Passive dissolution studies in vitro proved an ion release of Mg(2+) and PO4(3-) as well as Sr(2+), which is fundamental for in vivo degradation and a bone growth promoting effect. In our opinion, this work broadens the range of bioceramic bone replacement materials suitable for additive manufacturing processing. The high biodegradability of MPC ceramics together with the anticipated promoting effect on osseointegration opens up the way for a patient-specific treatment with the prospect of a fast and complete healing of bone fractures.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-12-02", "authors": ["SusanneMeininger", "SouravMandal", "AlokKumar", "J\u00fcrgenGroll", "BikramjitBasu", "UweGbureck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.050"}

By using a computer-aided deposition process, a unique control over pore size and interconnectivity of the resulting scaffolds is achieved, features highly interesting for tissue engineering applications. However, MEW has been mainly used to process low melting point thermoplastics such as poly(\u03b5-caprolactone). Since this polymer exhibits creep and a reduction in modulus upon hydration, we manufactured scaffolds of poly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone-co-acryloyl carbonate) (poly(LLA-\u03b5-CL-AC)), a photo-cross-linkable and biodegradable polymer, for the first time. We show that the stiffness of the scaffolds increases significantly (up to \u223c10-fold) after cross-linking by UV irradiation at room temperature, compared with un-cross-linked microfiber scaffolds. The preservation of stiffness and high average fiber modulus (370 \u00b1 166 MPa) within the cross-linked hydrated scaffolds upon repetitive loading (10% strain at 1 Hz up to 200,000 cycles) suggests that the prepared scaffolds may be of potential interest for soft connective tissue engineering applications.

To illustrate this point, we use large-scale multi-material printing to examine the scaling of the elastic modulus of 2D carbon allotropes at the macroscale and validate our printed model using experimental testing. The resulting hand-held materials can be examined more readily, and yield insights beyond those available in the original digital representations.

{"title": "3D Printing Bioceramic Porous Scaffolds with Good Mechanical Property and Cell Affinity.", "abstract": "Artificial bone grafting is widely used in current orthopedic surgery for bone defect problems. Unfortunately, surgeons remain unsatisfied with the current commercially available products. One of the major complaints is that these products cannot provide sufficient mechanical strength to support the human skeletal structure. In this study, we aimed to develop a bone scaffold with better mechanical property and good cell affinity by 3D printing (3DP) techniques. A self-developed 3D printer with laser-aided gelling (LAG) process was used to fabricate bioceramic scaffolds with inter-porous structures. To improve the mechanical property of the bioceramic parts after heating, CaCO3 was added to the silica ceramic slurry. CaCO3 was blended into a homogenous SiO2-sol dispersion at weight ratios varying from 0/100 to 5/95 to 9/91 (w/w). Bi-component CaCO3/SiO2-sol was prepared as a biocomposite for the 3DP scaffold. The well-mixed biocomposite was used to fabricate the bioceramic green part using the LAG method. The varied scaffolds were sintered at different temperatures ranging from 900 to 1500\u00b0C, and the mechanical property was subsequently analyzed. The scaffolds showed good property with the composite ratio of 5:95 CaCO3:SiO2 at a sintering temperature of 1300\u00b0C. The compressive strength was 47 MPa, and the porosity was 34%.

Quercetin, one of the major phytoestrogens isolated from onions and apples, was directly incorporated into CDHA for local administration in place of bisphosphonates (BPs) (which are recognized as standard treatment in osteoporosis), to avoid drug side effects. The CDHA scaffolds with quercetin (QC-CDHA) showed favorable mechanical properties (compressive strength < 21 MPa) as well as pore morphology. Quercetin was steadily released with the biodegradation of CDHA scaffolds in vitro without any initial burst. The QC-CDHA scaffolds greatly influenced both osteoblast and osteoclast cell activities. The QC-CDHA scaffolds significantly increased pre-osteoblast cell (MC3T3-E1) proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization, whereas osteoclast cell (RANK treated RAW 264.7) proliferation and differentiation were dramatically suppressed. The influence of quercetin on bone tissue regeneration was superior to alendronate, which is one of the most commonly administered BPs. All results indicated that quercetin in CDHA scaffolds plays an important role in both enhancing bone formation and suppressing bone resorption. Consequently, this technology promises great potential in osteoporotic bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "Regenerative Medicine for Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases.", "abstract": "The balance between bone resorption and bone formation is vital for maintenance and regeneration of alveolar bone and supporting structures around teeth and dental implants. Tissue regeneration in the oral cavity is regulated by multiple cell types, signaling mechanisms, and matrix interactions. A goal for periodontal tissue engineering/regenerative medicine is to restore oral soft and hard tissues through cell, scaffold, and/or signaling approaches to functional and aesthetic oral tissues. Bony defects in the oral cavity can vary significantly, ranging from smaller intrabony lesions resulting from periodontal or peri-implant diseases to large osseous defects that extend through the jaws as a result of trauma, tumor resection, or congenital defects. The disparity in size and location of these alveolar defects is compounded further by patient-specific and environmental factors that contribute to the challenges in periodontal regeneration, peri-implant tissue regeneration, and alveolar ridge reconstruction. Efforts have been made over the last few decades to produce reliable and predictable methods to stimulate bone regeneration in alveolar bone defects. Tissue engineering/regenerative medicine provide new avenues to enhance tissue regeneration by introducing bioactive models or constructing patient-specific substitutes. This review presents an overview of therapies (e.g., protein, gene, and cell based) and biomaterials (e.g., resorbable, nonresorbable, and 3-dimensionally printed) used for alveolar bone engineering around teeth and implants and for implant site development, with emphasis on most recent findings and future directions.", "journal": "Journal of dental research", "date": "2015-11-27", "authors": ["LLarsson", "A MDecker", "LNibali", "S PPilipchuk", "TBerglundh", "W VGiannobile"], "doi": "10.1177/0022034515618887\n10.1111/jopr.12316\n10.1155/2015/850340"}
{"title": "Interobserver variability in physician-modified endograft planning by comparison with a three-dimensional printed aortic model.", "abstract": "With the increasing application of fenestrated and physician-modified endografting for aneurysm repair, there is increasing concern about the accuracy of vessel position measurements based on computed tomography scans. Inaccuracies in measurements may result in a \"window-shutter\" or \"eclipsing\" phenomenon whereby the fenestration may not overlie the vessel ostium completely. We hypothesized that vessel position measurements from reconstructed imaging do not represent the true vessel position as obtained from a three-dimensional (3D) printed physical model of the visceral aortic segment.\nMedical 3D modeling software was used to develop the 3D reconstructions, which were then exported to the 3D printing software. This allowed 3D models to be physically generated. The distances to the top and bottom and the angle of each of the celiac, superior mesenteric, right renal, and left renal arteries were recorded. These same measurements were obtained by each of the blinded reviewers in addition to the aortic diameter at the midpoint of each of these vessels. Measurements were compared with intraclass correlation coefficient, nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test, and one-sample t-test to assess accuracy and precision. Statistical significance was set at P\u00a0< .05 for all tests.\nBoth the individual measurements and the average of the measurements were statistically accurate (significant) for the bottom of the superior mesenteric artery and the top and bottom of both the right and left renal arteries. There was variability and inaccuracy in all visceral vessel angles and in the bottom of the celiac artery (the top and the angle of the celiac artery were the arbitrary referents).\nWhereas the visceral vessel orifices are largely accurately assessed and measured, the vessel angles are not. This may lead to an eclipsing phenomenon, which may contribute to branch or fenestrated vessel failure and therefore reintervention. Further efforts should assess the clinical significance of the eclipsing phenomenon and should target accurate and appropriate fenestration construction to prevent long-term morbidity.", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery", "date": "2015-11-27", "authors": ["IssamKoleilat", "MichaelJaeggli", "Joseph AEwing", "MarkAndroes", "Dan TSimionescu", "JohnEidt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jvs.2015.09.044"}

Mechanostabilization of shape of biological structure via morphogenesis has several beautiful examples. With the help of simple mechanics-based modeling and experiments, we show an important causality between natural shape selection as evolutionary outcome and the mechanostabilization of seashells. The effect of biological growth on the mechanostabilization process is identified with examples of two natural shapes of seashells, one having a diametrically converging localization of stresses and the other having a helicoidally concentric localization of stresses. We demonstrate how the evolved shape enables predictable protection of soft body parts of the species. The effect of bioavailability of natural material is found to be a secondary factor compared to shape selectivity, where material microstructure only acts as a constraint to evolutionary optimization. This is confirmed by comparing the mechanostabilization behavior of three-dimensionally printed synthetic polymer structural shapes with that of natural seashells consisting of ceramic and protein.

Although hydroxyapatite is widely being considered for bone tissue engineering applications due to its occurrence in the natural extracellular matrix of this tissue, limited reports are available on additive manufacturing of hydroxyapatite-based materials. In this perspective, hydroxyapatite-based three-dimensional porous scaffolds with two different binders (maltodextrin and sodium alginate) were fabricated using the extrusion method of three-dimensional plotting and the results were compared in reference to the structural properties of scaffolds processed via chemical stabilization and sintering routes, respectively. With the optimal processing conditions regarding to pH and viscosity of binder-loaded hydroxyapatite pastes, scaffolds with parallelepiped porous architecture having up to 74% porosity were fabricated. Interestingly, sintering of the as-plotted hydroxyapatite-sodium alginate (cross-linked with CaCl2 solution) scaffolds led to the formation of chlorapatite (Ca9.54P5.98O23.8Cl1.60(OH)2.74). Both the sintered scaffolds displayed progressive deformation and delayed fracture under compressive loading, with hydroxyapatite-alginate scaffolds exhibiting a higher compressive strength (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009MPa) than hydroxyapatite-maltodextrin scaffolds (7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009MPa).

{"title": "Near-Field Sound Localization Based on the Small Profile Monaural Structure.", "abstract": "The acoustic wave around a sound source in the near-field area presents unconventional properties in the temporal, spectral, and spatial domains due to the propagation mechanism. This paper investigates a near-field sound localizer in a small profile structure with a single microphone. The asymmetric structure around the microphone provides a distinctive spectral variation that can be recognized by the dedicated algorithm for directional localization. The physical structure consists of ten pipes of different lengths in a vertical fashion and rectangular wings positioned between the pipes in radial directions. The sound from an individual direction travels through the nearest open pipe, which generates the particular fundamental frequency according to the acoustic resonance. The Cepstral parameter is modified to evaluate the fundamental frequency. Once the system estimates the fundamental frequency of the received signal, the length of arrival and angle of arrival (AoA) are derived by the designed model. From an azimuthal distance of 3-15 cm from the outer body of the pipes, the extensive acoustic experiments with a 3D-printed structure show that the direct and side directions deliver average hit rates of 89% and 73%, respectively.

{"title": "Hydrodynamic function of biomimetic shark skin: effect of denticle pattern and spacing.", "abstract": "The structure of shark skin has been the subject of numerous studies and recently biomimetic shark skin has been fabricated with rigid denticles (scales) on a flexible substrate. This artificial skin can bend and generate thrust when attached to a mechanical controller. The ability to control the manufacture of biomimetic shark skin facilitates manipulation of surface parameters and understanding the effects of changing denticle patterns on locomotion. In this paper we investigate the effect of changing the spacing and arrangement of denticles on the surface of biomimetic shark skin on both static and dynamic locomotor performance. We designed 3D-printed flexible membranes with different denticle patterns and spacings: (1) staggered-overlapped, (2) linear-overlapped, and (3) linear-non-overlapped, and compared these to a 3D-printed smooth-surfaced control. These 3D printed shark skin models were then tested in a flow tank with a mechanical flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically. We swam the membranes at a frequency of 1 Hz with different heave amplitudes (from \u00b11 cm to \u00b13 cm) while measuring forces, torques, self-propelled swimming speed, and cost of transport (COT). Static tests revealed drag reduction of denticle patterns compared to a smooth control at low speeds, but increased drag at speeds above 25 cm s(-1). However, during dynamic (swimming) tests, the staggered-overlapped pattern produced the fastest swimming speeds with no significant increase in the COT at lower heave values. For instance, at a heave frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of \u00b11 cm, swimming speed of the staggered-overlapped pattern increased by 25.2% over the smooth control. At higher heave amplitudes, significantly faster self-propelled swimming speeds were achieved by the staggered-overlapped pattern, but with higher COT. Only the staggered-overlapped pattern provides a significant swimming performance advantage over the smooth control and the other two denticle patterns. Quantitative hydrodynamic comparisons among skin models where control over manufacture allows alteration of design parameters provides a useful experimental tool for future work on the considerable natural diversity of shark skin denticles both among species and on different body locations.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["LiWen", "James CWeaver", "Patrick J MThornycroft", "George VLauder"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/10/6/066010"}
{"title": "3D printed Ti6Al4V implant surface promotes bone maturation and retains a higher density of less aged osteocytes at the bone-implant interface.", "abstract": "For load-bearing orthopaedic applications, metal implants having an interconnected pore structure exhibit the potential to facilitate bone ingrowth and the possibility for reducing the stiffness mismatch between the implant and bone, thus eliminating stress-shielding effects. 3D printed solid and macro-porous Ti6Al4V implants were evaluated after six-months healing in adult sheep femora. The ultrastructural composition of the bone-implant interface was investigated using Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy, in a correlative manner. The mineral crystallinity and the mineral-to-matrix ratios of the interfacial tissue and the native bone were found to be similar. However, lower Ca/P ratios, lower carbonate content, but higher proline, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels indicated that the interfacial tissue remained less mature. Bone healing was more advanced at the porous implant surface (vs. the solid implant surface) based on the interfacial tissue \u03bd1 CO3(2-)/\u03bd2 PO4(3-) ratio, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels approaching those of the native bone. The mechanosensing infrastructure in bone, the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network, retained \u223c40% more canaliculi per osteocyte lacuna, i.e., a 'less aged' morphology at the interface. The osteocyte density per mineralised surface area was \u223c36-71% higher at the interface after extended healing periods.\nIn osseointegration research, the success of an implant surface or design is commonly determined by quantifying the amount of new bone, rather than its maturation, composition and structure. This work describes a novel correlative methodology to investigate the ultrastructure and composition of bone formed around and within 3D printed Ti6Al4V implants having an interconnected open-pore structure. Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the molecular composition of the interfacial tissue at different implant surfaces may vary, suggesting differences in the extent to which bone maturation occurs even after long-term healing. Bone maturation corresponded well with the structural parameters associated with remodelling kinetics, for example, the osteocyte density and the average number of canaliculi per osteocyte lacuna.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["Furqan AShah", "AndersSnis", "AleksandarMatic", "PeterThomsen", "AndersPalmquist"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.013"}

The benchtop flow-loop consists of a 3D printed aortic bed using Accura 60 polymer driven by a continuous-flow pump. Three hundred spherical particles simulating thrombi of 2, 3.5, and 5 mm diameters were injected at the mock VAD-OG inlet. A water and glycerin mixture (3.8 cP viscosity) synthetically mimicked blood. The flowrate was adjusted to match the CFD Reynolds number. Catch cans were used to capture and count particles reaching cerebral vessels. VAD-OG geometries were evaluated using comparison of means Z-score range of -1.96 \u2264 Z \u2264 1.96 to demonstrate overall agreement between computational and in-vitro techniques. Z-scores were: (i) Z = -1.05 for perpendicular (0\u00b0), (ii) Z = 0.32 for intermediate (30\u00b0), and (iii) Z = -0.52 for shallow (60\u00b0) anastomosis and confirmed agreement for all geometries. This study confirmed added benefits of using a left carotid artery bypass-graft with percent embolization reduction: 22.6% for perpendicular, 21.2% for intermediate, and 11.9% for shallow anastomoses. The shallow anastomosis demonstrated lower degrees of aortic arch flow recirculation, consistent with steady-flow computations.

Acrylic bone cement is a commonly used alternative. However, the manual shaping of the bone cement is difficult and may not lead to a satisfactory implant in some cases. The object of this study was to determine the feasibility of fabricating molds using a commercial low-cost 3D printer for the purpose of producing patient-specific acrylic cranioplasty implants. METHODS Using data from a high-resolution brain CT scan of a patient with a calvarial defect posthemicraniectomy, a skull phantom and a mold were generated with computer software and fabricated with the 3D printer using the fused deposition modeling method. The mold was used as a template to shape the acrylic implant, which was formed via a polymerization reaction. The resulting implant was fitted to the skull phantom and the cranial index of symmetry was determined. RESULTS The skull phantom and mold were successfully fabricated with the 3D printer. The application of acrylic bone cement to the mold was simple and straightforward. The resulting implant did not require further adjustment or drilling prior to being fitted to the skull phantom. The cranial index of symmetry was 96.2% (the cranial index of symmetry is 100% for a perfectly symmetrical skull).

The PCL scaffolds were surface coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) to enable further comparison of the osteoinductive potential of different scaffolds: PCL (control), PCL/CaP-coated, PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds. The PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG composite scaffolds were reproducibly manufactured with a morphology highly resembling that of PCL only scaffolds. However, 50wt% loading of the bioactive glass (BG) particles into the PCL bulk decreased the scaffold's compressive Young's modulus. Coating of PCL scaffolds with CaP had a negligible effect on the scaffold's porosity and compressive Young's modulus. When immersed in culture media, BG dissolution ions (Si and Sr) were detected for up to 10weeks in the immersion media and surface precipitates were formed on both PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds' surfaces, indicating good in vitro bioactivity. In vitro cell studies were conducted using sheep bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) under non-osteogenic or osteogenic conditioned media, and under static or dynamic culture environments. All scaffolds were able to support cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. However, when cultured in non-osteogenic media, only PCL/CaP, PCL/50-45S5 and PCL/50-SrBG scaffolds showed an up-regulation of osteogenic gene expression. Additionally, under a dynamic culture environment, the rate of cell growth, proliferation and osteoblast-related gene expression was enhanced across all scaffold groups.

Additive manufacturing by fused deposition modeling is a widely used technique to produce porous scaffolds with defined pore network, geometry, and therewith defined mechanical properties. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for tissue engineering-based cell therapies due to their multipotent character. One of the hurdles to overcome when combining additive manufactured scaffolds with MSCs is the resulting heterogeneous cell distribution and limited cell proliferation capacity. In this study, we show that the use of a biaxial rotating bioreactor, after static culture of human fetal MSCs (hfMSCs) seeded on synthetic polymeric scaffolds, improved the homogeneity of cell and extracellular matrix distribution and increased the total cell number. Furthermore, we show that the relative mRNA expression levels of indicators for stemness and differentiation are not significantly changed upon this bioreactor culture, whereas static culture shows variations of several indicators for stemness and differentiation. The biaxial rotating bioreactor presented here offers a homogeneous distribution of hfMSCs, enabling studies on MSCs fate in additive manufactured scaffolds without inducing undesired differentiation.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2015-11-12", "authors": ["Anne MLeferink", "Yhee-ChengChng", "Clemens Avan Blitterswijk", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2015.00169\n10.1098/rsif.2012.0068\n10.1007/s10439-006-9244-z\n10.1002/jbm.820280504\n10.1002/jbm.a.33051\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.03.003\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.12.015\n10.1089/scd.2013.0301\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0694\n10.1007/s10856-006-0077-y\n10.1177/08959374990130011801\n10.1016/S0168-3659(01)00497-7\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01715.x\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0255\n10.1002/bit.23024\n10.1002/term.302\n10.1634/stemcells.22-4-487\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00279.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046842\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.044\n10.1002/stem.1309\n10.1007/s00441-008-0696-3\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2011.0722\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/2/025003\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.11.006\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1002/term.1842\n10.1089/ten.1998.4.415\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.12.001\n10.1007/s12015-009-9056-2\n10.1002/jbm.a.30499\n10.1002/adfm.200601158\n10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.003\n10.1002/term.506\n10.4161/cc.6.23.5095\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19991201)75:3<424::AID-JCB8>3.3.CO;2-#\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003720\n10.1002/stem.312\n10.1038/emboj.2011.157\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e318241dc3a\n10.1007/s10856-010-4153-y\n10.1002/jor.20402\n10.1186/1741-7015-11-146\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2005.03.021\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.11.003\n10.1002/jbm.a.31967\n10.1016/j.diff.2013.02.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044561\n10.1002/jbm.a.30232\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.10.056\n10.1002/bit.24497\n10.1007/s00277-012-1438-x\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0456\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.028"}

Therefore, the heat flow directions are examined for various laser beam scanning patterns based on numerical modeling of heat transfer and fluid flow in three dimensions.

One strategy proposed to reverse this trend consists of early exposure of medical students to the field. Against this backdrop, the present study presents an innovative approach for anatomy teaching, integrating a surgically relevant trend: 3D printing.\nWhole-body computed tomography (CT) was made of two cadavers. Twelve students performed measurements and 3D reconstructions of selected anatomical structures (Osirix, Mimics). 3D printed (3DP) models were obtained (ZPrinter 310 Plus), and the students completed the analogous measurements on these replicas. Finally, classical anatomical dissection was performed and the same parameters were measured. The differences between the values obtained by the three modalities were submitted to standard statistical analysis (Wilcoxon two-tail paired test).\nQualitative comparison of the digital 3D reconstructions based on the students' manual CT segmentation and the anatomical reality showed excellent correlation. Quantitatively, the values measured on the CT images and the physical models created by 3D printing differed from those measured on the cadavers by less than 2\u00a0mm. Students were highly appreciative of the approach (CT, 3DP, cadaver). Their average satisfaction score was 5.8 on a 1-6 scale.\nThis study shows that the approach proposed can be achieved. The results obtained also show that CT-based 3D printed models are close to the authentic anatomic reality.

{"title": "Engineering Pre-vascularized Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration.", "abstract": "Survival of functional tissue constructs of clinically relevant size depends on the formation of an organized and uniformly distributed network of blood vessels and capillaries. The lack of such vasculature leads to spatio-temporal gradients in oxygen, nutrients and accumulation of waste products inside engineered tissue constructs resulting in negative biological events at the core of the scaffold. Unavailability of a well-defined vasculature also results in ineffective integration of scaffolds to the host vasculature upon implantation. Arguably, one of the greatest challenges in engineering clinically relevant bone substitutes, therefore, has been the development of vascularized bone scaffolds. Various approaches ranging from peptide and growth factor functionalized biomaterials to hyper-porous scaffolds have been proposed to address this problem with reasonable success. An emerging alternative to address this challenge has been the fabrication of pre-vascularized scaffolds by taking advantage of biomanufacturing techniques, such as soft- and photo-lithography or 3D bioprinting, and cell-based approaches, where functional capillaries are engineered in cell-laden scaffolds prior to implantation. These strategies seek to engineer pre-vascularized tissues in vitro, allowing for improved anastomosis with the host vasculature upon implantation, while also improving cell viability and tissue development in vitro. This book chapter provides an overview of recent methods to engineer pre-vascularized scaffolds for bone regeneration. We first review the development of functional blood capillaries in bony structures and discuss controlled delivery of growth factors, co-culture systems, and on-chip studies to engineer vascularized cell-laden biomaterials.

{"title": "Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) as a new drug carrier for 3D printed medical drug delivery devices.", "abstract": "The main purpose of this work was to investigate the printability of different grades of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers as new feedstock material for fused-deposition modeling (FDM\u2122)-based 3D printing technology in fabrication of custom-made T-shaped intrauterine systems (IUS) and subcutaneous rods (SR). The goal was to select an EVA grade with optimal properties, namely vinyl acetate content, melting index, flexural modulus, for 3D printing of implantable prototypes with the drug incorporated within the entire matrix of the medical devices. Indomethacin was used as a model drug in this study. Out of the twelve tested grades of the EVA five were printable. One of them showed superior print quality and was further investigated by printing drug-loaded filaments, containing 5% and 15% indomethacin. The feedstock filaments were fabricated by hot-melt extrusion (HME) below the melting point of the drug substance and the IUS and SR were successfully printed at the temperature above the melting point of the drug. As a result, the drug substance in the printed prototypes showed to be at least partly amorphous, while the drug in the corresponding HME filaments was crystalline. This difference affected the drug release profiles from the filaments and printed prototype products: faster release from the prototypes over 30days in the in vitro tests.

{"title": "Arrested Phase Separation of Elastin-like Polypeptide Solutions Yields Stiff, Thermoresponsive Gels.", "abstract": "The preparation of new responsive hydrogels is crucial for the development of soft materials for various applications, including additive manufacturing and biomedical implants. Here, we report the discovery of a new mechanism for forming physical hydrogels by the arrested phase separation of a subclass of responsively hydrophobic elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). When moderately concentrated solutions of ELPs with the pentapeptide repeat (XPAVG)n (where X is either 20% or 60% valine with the remainder isoleucine) are warmed above their inverse transition temperature, phase separation becomes arrested, and hydrogels can be formed with shear moduli on the order of 0.1-1 MPa at 20 wt % in water. The longest stress relaxation times are well beyond 10(3) s. This result is surprising because ELPs are classically known for thermoresponsive coacervation that leads to macrophase separation, and solids are typically formed in the bulk or by supplemental cross-linking strategies. This new mechanism can form gels with remarkable mechanical behavior based on simple macromolecules that can be easily engineered. Small angle scattering experiments indicate that phase separation arrests to form a network of nanoscale domains, exhibiting rheological and structural features consistent with an arrested spinodal decomposition mechanism. Gel nanostructure can be modeled as a disordered bicontinuous network with interdomain, intradomain, and curvature length scales that can be controlled by sequence design and assembly conditions.

However, the effects of CS on osteoblast and macrophage cells are not fully understood. This study examines cell proliferation and differentiation of mono- or co-cultured MC3T3-E1 and Raw 264.7 cells on CS cement. Very few studies to date have looked at the effects of osteoblast and macrophages on biomaterial-regulated osteogenesis. In this study the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1, Raw 264.7 and co-cultured MC3T3-E1/Raw 264.7 on CS cements have been analyzed using a PrestoBlue kit and ELISA. In addition, the effect of macrophages on CS-coordinated osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 has been investigated. Results show that MC3T3-E1, Raw 264.7 and co-cultured MC3T3-E1/Raw 264.7 adhere to and proliferate well on the CS cement. In a co-culture, the CS cements inhibit receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand expression of both genes and proteins in Raw 264.7 cells when compared to those grown in mono-cultured system. Ca deposition of MC3T3-E1 in the co-culture is higher than that of cells in a mono-culture. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is also significantly up-regulated by the CS cement stimulation, indicating that macrophages may participate in the CS stimulated osteogenesis. Interestingly, when macrophage are cultured with BMP2 receptor-blocking MC3T3-E1 on the CS cements, the osteogenesis differentiation of the cells is significantly inhibited, indicating the important role of macrophages in biomaterial-induced osteogenesis via BMP2 receptors. It is assumed that it is an increase in the secretion of the BMP2 from the Raw 264.7 cell that is primarily involved in the promotion of the osteogenesis of the MC3T3-E1.

Then its workability time, closely related to the gelling time, was evaluated thanks to rheological analysis: finally, the quantification of static and dynamic diffusion constants of genipin across nonreacting and reacting membranes, made respectively by agarose and gelatin, was performed. It was shown that the colorimetric analysis is a good indicator of the reaction progress.

Post-printing structure formation is an autonomous process governed by fundamental biological organizing principles. As the quantitative formulation of such principles is notoriously difficult, bioprinting remains largely a trial and error approach. To address this problem, specifically in extrusion bioprinting, we have recently developed an effective computational method, the cellular particle dynamics (CPDs). We have demonstrated the predictive power of CPD in cases of simple printed constructs prepared with spherical multicellular bioink units. Here we generalize CPD to the important practical case of tubular grafts printed with cylindrical bioink units by taking into account the realistic experimental situation in which the length and the volume of the cylinders decrease post-printing. Based on our results, we provide a set of instructions for the use of CPD simulations to directly predict tubular graft formation without the need to carry out the corresponding complex and expensive control experiments. Using these instructions allows the efficient and timely biofabrication of tubular organ structures. A particularly instructive outcome of our analysis is that building tubular organ structures, such as vascular grafts by bioprinting can be done considerably faster by using cylindrical rather than spherical bionk units.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["AshkanShafiee", "MatthewMcCune", "GaborForgacs", "IoanKosztin"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045005"}

{"title": "3D printed bioceramics for dual antibiotic delivery to treat implant-associated bone infection.", "abstract": "Surgical implant-associated bone infections (osteomyelitis) have severe clinical and socioeconomic consequences. Treatment of chronic bone infections often involves antibiotics given systemically and locally to the affected site in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement. Given the high antibiotic concentrations required to affect bacteria in biofilm, local delivery is important to achieve high doses at the infection site. PMMA is not suitable to locally-deliver some biofilm-specific antibiotics, including rifampin, due to interference with PMMA polymerisation. To examine the efficacy of localised, combinational antibiotic delivery compared to PMMA standards, we fabricated rifampin- and vancomycin-laden calcium phosphate scaffolds (CPS) by three-dimensional (3D) printing to treat an implant-associated Staphylococcus aureus bone infection in a murine model. All vancomycin- and rifampin-laden CPS treatments significantly reduced the bacterial burden compared with vancomycin-laden PMMA. The bones were bacteria culture negative in 50 % of the mice that received sustained release vancomycin- and rifampin-laden CPS. In contrast, 100 % of the bones treated with vancomycin monotherapy using PMMA or CPS were culture positive. Yet, the monotherapy CPS significantly reduced the bacterial metabolic load following revision compared to PMMA. Biofilm persisted on the fixation hardware, but the infection-induced bone destruction was significantly reduced by local rifampin delivery. These data demonstrate that, despite the challenging implant-retaining infection model, co-delivery of rifampin and vancomycin from 3D printed CPS, which is not possible with PMMA, significantly improved the outcomes of implant-associated osteomyelitis. However, biofilm persistence on the fixation hardware reaffirms the importance of implant exchange or other biofilm eradication strategies to complement local antibiotics.", "journal": "European cells & materials", "date": "2015-11-05", "authors": ["J AInzana", "R PTrombetta", "E MSchwarz", "S LKates", "H AAwad"], "doi": "10.22203/ecm.v030a16"}

In this study, extrusion-based 3D bioprinting technology was utilized for biofabricating ESCs into 3D cell-laden construct. The influence of 3D printing parameters on ESC viability, proliferation, maintenance of pluripotency and the rule of EB formation was systematically studied in this work. Results demonstrated that ESCs were successfully printed with hydrogel into 3D macroporous construct. Upon process optimization, about 90% ESCs remained alive after the process of bioprinting and cell-laden construct formation. ESCs continued proliferating into spheroid EBs in the hydrogel construct, while retaining the protein expression and gene expression of pluripotent markers, like octamer binding transcription factor 4, stage specific embryonic antigen 1 and Nanog.

{"title": "Parallel-hole collimator concept for stationary SPECT imaging.", "abstract": "Parallel-hole SPECT collimators have traditionally been manufactured by stacking sheets of lead foil or by casting. These techniques significantly restrict our options in terms of collimator geometry. However, recent developments in metal additive manufacturing are making novel collimator designs possible, giving rise to new opportunities in SPECT imaging. In this paper we propose an innovative type of collimator for stationary SPECT, using parallel-holes whose collimation direction depends on their axial position. Its main advantage compared to current stationary SPECT systems (which are based on pinholes) is that, using only axial bed translations, we can achieve complete angular sampling of an increased portion of the transaxial area of the collimator bore. This allows the system to be much more compact than current stationary SPECT systems that image objects of the same size. We describe three possible designs, for full-body, brain and small-animal imaging, respectively, and test their feasibility using simulations. The system modeling method is validated against realistic Monte Carlo simulations, and then used in the evaluation of the systems' performances and reconstructions. The simulations show that the system is able to reconstruct objects occupying the predicted field of view ([Formula: see text] of the transaxial area of the bore) without sampling artifacts.

The i3D printing technique includes 3D printing of a mold and a sacrificial molding process. PCL/chloroform and gelatin/water were physically mixed to prepare the blend solution, which was subsequently injected into the cavity of a 3D printed mold. After solvent removal and gelatin cross-linking, the mold was dissolved to obtain a PCL-gelatin (PG) scaffold, with a specific 3D structure. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that PCL masses and gelatin fibers in the PG scaffold homogenously coexisted without chemical bonding. Compression tests confirmed that gelatin incorporation into the PCL enhanced its mechanical flexibility and softness, to the point of being suitable for soft-tissue engineering, as opposed to pure PCL. Human adipose-derived stem cells, cultured on a PG scaffold, exhibited enhanced in vitro chondrogenic differentiation and tissue formation, compared with those on a PCL scaffold.

{"title": "The influence of printing parameters on cell survival rate and printability in microextrusion-based 3D cell printing technology.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell printing technology has provided a versatile methodology to fabricate cell-laden tissue-like constructs and in vitro tissue/pathological models for tissue engineering, drug testing and screening applications. However, it still remains a challenge to print bioinks with high viscoelasticity to achieve long-term stable structure and maintain high cell survival rate after printing at the same time. In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of 3D cell printing parameters, i.e. composition and concentration of bioink, holding temperature and holding time, on the printability and cell survival rate in microextrusion-based 3D cell printing technology. Rheological measurements were utilized to characterize the viscoelasticity of gelatin-based bioinks. Results demonstrated that the bioink viscoelasticity was increased when increasing the bioink concentration, increasing holding time and decreasing holding temperature below gelation temperature. The decline of cell survival rate after 3D cell printing process was observed when increasing the viscoelasticity of the gelatin-based bioinks. However, different process parameter combinations would result in the similar rheological characteristics and thus showed similar cell survival rate after 3D bioprinting process. On the other hand, bioink viscoelasticity should also reach a certain point to ensure good printability and shape fidelity. At last, we proposed a protocol for 3D bioprinting of temperature-sensitive gelatin-based hydrogel bioinks with both high cell survival rate and good printability. This research would be useful for biofabrication researchers to adjust the 3D bioprinting process parameters quickly and as a referable template for designing new bioinks.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-11-03", "authors": ["YuZhao", "YangLi", "ShuangshuangMao", "WeiSun", "RuiYao"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045002"}

While factors controlling their mechanical and biological response have recently been the subject of intense research, the interplay between mechanical properties, bone ingrowth requirements, and manufacturing constraints, is still unclear. In this paper, we present two high-strength stretch-dominated topologies, the Tetrahedron and the Octet truss, as well as an intuitive visualization method to understand the relationship of cell topology, pore size, porosity with constraints imposed by bone ingrowth requirements and additive manufacturing. 40 samples of selected porosities are fabricated using Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and their morphological deviations resulting from SLM are assessed via micro-CT. Mechanical compression testing is used to obtain stiffness and strength properties, whereas bone ingrowth is assessed in a canine in vivo model at four and eight weeks. The results show that the maximum strength and stiffness ranged from 227.86\u00b110.15 to 31.37\u00b12.19MPa and 4.58\u00b10.18 to 1.23\u00b10.40GPa respectively, and the maximum 0.2% offset strength is almost 5 times stronger than that of tantalum foam. For Tetrahedron samples, bone ingrowth after four and eight weeks is 28.6%\u00b111.6%, and 41.3%\u00b14.3%, while for the Octet truss 35.5%\u00b11.9% and 56.9%\u00b14.0% respectively. This research is the first to demonstrate the occurrence of bone ingrowth into high-strength porous biomaterials which have higher structural efficiency than current porous biomaterials in the market.\nWe present two stretch-dominated cell topologies for porous biomaterials that can be used for load-bearing orthopaedic applications, and prove that they encourage bone ingrowth in a canine model. We also introduce an intuitive method to visualize and understand the relationship of cell topology, pore size, porosity with constraints imposed by bone ingrowth requirements and additive manufacturing.

The interdigitated microstructure consisting of poly lactic acid was injected by a 3D printer and coated with silver and aluminum with a series of dip-coatings.

This unique alignment of technology offers an enormous reduction in the number of fabrication steps when compared with more traditional methods of manufacture. The prototype incorporated 2 Adams clasps and a fitted labial bow. The alloy components were built from cobalt-chromium in an initial powdered form using established digital technology methods and then inserted into a build of a resin base plate. This article reports the first known use of computer-aided design and additive manufacture to fabricate a resin and alloy appliance, and constitutes proof of the concept for such manufacturing. The original workflow described could be seen as an example for many other similar appliances, perhaps with active components. The scan data were imported into an appropriate specialized computer-aided design software, which was used in conjunction with a force feedback (haptic) interface. The appliance designs were then exported as stereolithography files and transferred to an additive manufacturing machine for fabrication. The results showed that the applied techniques may provide new manufacturing and design opportunities in orthodontics and highlights the need for intraoral-specific additive manufacture materials to be produced and tested for biocompatibility compliance.

Ten mice received half-brain radiation while positioned in the 3D-printed head holder. Animal placement was achieved using on-board image guidance and computerized asymmetric collimators. To evaluate the precision of beam localization for half-brain irradiation, mice were sacrificed approximately 30 min after treatment and brain sections were stained for \u03b3-H2AX, a marker for DNA breaks. The distance and angle of the \u03b3-H2AX radiation beam border to longitudinal fissure were measured on histological samples. Animals were monitored for any possible trauma from the device.\nVisualization of the radiation beam on ex vivo brain sections with \u03b3-H2AX immunohistochemical staining showed a sharp radiation field within the tissue. Measurements showed a mean irradiation targeting error of 0.14\u00b10.09 mm (standard deviation). Rotation between the beam axis and mouse head was 1.2\u00b0\u00b11.0\u00b0 (standard deviation).

{"title": "Biocompatible Hydrogels for Microarray Cell Printing and Encapsulation.", "abstract": "Conventional drug screening processes are a time-consuming and expensive endeavor, but highly rewarding when they are successful. To identify promising lead compounds, millions of compounds are traditionally screened against therapeutic targets on human cells grown on the surface of 96-wells. These two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayers are physiologically irrelevant, thus, often providing false-positive or false-negative results, when compared to cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) structures such as hydrogel droplets. However, 3D cell culture systems are not easily amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS), thus inherently low throughput, and requiring relatively large volume for cell-based assays. In addition, it is difficult to control cellular microenvironments and hard to obtain reliable cell images due to focus position and transparency issues. To overcome these problems, miniaturized 3D cell cultures in hydrogels were developed via cell printing techniques where cell spots in hydrogels can be arrayed on the surface of glass slides or plastic chips by microarray spotters and cultured in growth media to form cells encapsulated 3D droplets for various cell-based assays. These approaches can dramatically reduce assay volume, provide accurate control over cellular microenvironments, and allow us to obtain clear 3D cell images for high-content imaging (HCI).

Microscale pillars are first produced by the localized femtosecond laser polymerization and are subsequently self-assembled into periodic hierarchical architectures with the assistance of controlled capillary force. Moreover, based on anisotropic assemblies of micropillars, the LPCS method is further developed for the preparation of more complicated and advanced functional microstructures. Pillars cross section, height, and spatial arrangement can be tuned to guide capillary force, and diverse assemblies with different configurations are thus achieved. Finally, we developed a strategy for growing micro/nanoparticles in designed spatial locations through solution-evaporation self-assembly induced by morphology.

When a crack nucleates and reaches the capillary, the internal pressure changes signifying the existence of the flaw. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the crack detection capacity of the eSHM system and crack location accuracy by means of various non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques. During this study, detailed acoustic emission (AE) analysis was applied in AM materials for the first time in order to investigate if phenomena like the Kaiser effect and waveform parameters used in conventional metals can offer valuable insight into the damage accumulation of the AM structure as well. Liquid penetrant inspection, eddy current and radiography were also used in order to confirm the fatigue damage and indicate the damage location on un-notched four-point bending AM metallic specimens with an integrated eSHM system. It is shown that the eSHM system in combination with NDT can provide correct information on the damage condition of additive manufactured metals.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-10-28", "authors": ["MariaStrantza", "Dimitrios GAggelis", "Dieterde Baere", "PatrickGuillaume", "Dannyvan Hemelrijck"], "doi": "10.3390/s151026709\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/5/055020\n10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z\n10.1177/1475921715604389\n10.1016/j.aei.2012.06.006\n10.3390/s110302525\n10.1016/j.measurement.2015.04.007\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/19/195002\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.027\n10.1016/j.msea.2010.12.010\n10.1016/j.measurement.2015.01.024\n10.1016/S0143-974X(02)00064-0\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2011.01.011\n10.1007/s11665-011-0119-6\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.01.014\n10.1016/S0167-6636(01)00081-3\n10.1155/2013/869467\n10.1155/2015/139695\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60206-6\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.11.011"}
{"title": "Micropatch-arrayed pads for non-invasive spatial and temporal profiling of topical drugs on skin surface.", "abstract": "Micropatch-arrayed pads (MAPAs) are presented as a facile and sensitive sampling method for spatial profiling of topical agents adsorbed on the surface of skin. MAPAs are 28\u2009\u00d7\u200928\u2009mm sized pieces of polytetrafluoroethylene containing plurality of cavities filled with agarose hydrogel. They are affixed onto skin for 10\u2009min with the purpose to collect drugs applied topically. Polar compounds are absorbed by the hydrogel micropatches. The probes are subsequently scanned by an automated nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry system operated in the tapping dual-polarity mode. When the liquid junction gets into contact with every micropatch, polar compounds absorbed in the hydrogel matrix are desorbed and transferred to the ion source. A 3D-printed interface prevents evaporation of hydrogel micropatches assuring good reproducibility and sensitivity. MAPAs have been applied to follow dispersion of topical drugs applied to human skin in vivo and to porcine skin ex vivo, in the form of self-adhesive patches. Spatiotemporal characteristics of the drug dispersion process have been revealed using this non-invasive test. Differences between drug dispersion in vivo and ex vivo could be observed. We envision that MAPAs can be used to investigate spatiotemporal kinetics of various topical agents utilized in medical treatment.", "journal": "Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS", "date": "2015-10-28", "authors": ["Ewelina PDutkiewicz", "Hsien-YiChiu", "Pawel LUrban"], "doi": "10.1002/jms.3702"}

These infections generally occur in areas with poor blood flow and pathogens do not always respond to antibiotic treatment. With the latest developments in nanotechnology, the incorporation of antibiotics into prosthetic implants may soon become a standard procedure. The success will, however, depend on the ability to control the release of antibiotics at concentrations high enough to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant strains. Through additive manufacturing, antibiotics can be incorporated into cementless femoral stems to produce prosthetic devices with antimicrobial properties. With the emerging increase in resistance to antibiotics, the incorporation of antimicrobial compounds other than antibiotics, preferably drugs with a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity, will have to be explored.

{"title": "Effect of Ceramic Scaffold Architectural Parameters on Biological Response.", "abstract": "Numerous studies have focused on the optimization of ceramic architectures to fulfill a variety of scaffold functional requirements and improve biological response. Conventional fabrication techniques, however, do not allow for the production of geometrically controlled, reproducible structures and often fail to allow the independent variation of individual geometric parameters. Current developments in additive manufacturing technologies suggest that 3D printing will allow a more controlled and systematic exploration of scaffold architectures. This more direct translation of design into structure requires a pipeline for design-driven optimization. A theoretical framework for systematic design and evaluation of architectural parameters on biological response is presented. Four levels of architecture are considered, namely (1) surface topography, (2) pore size and geometry, (3) porous networks, and (4) macroscopic pore arrangement, including the potential for spatially varied architectures. Studies exploring the effect of various parameters within these levels are reviewed. This framework will hopefully allow uncovering of new relationships between architecture and biological response in a more systematic way as well as inform future refinement of fabrication techniques to fulfill architectural necessities with a consideration of biological implications.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["Maria IsabellaGariboldi", "Serena MBest"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2015.00151\n10.1177/1081286505059739\n10.1007/s00161-007-0052-y\n10.1111/j.0022-2720.2004.01354.x\n10.1002/jbm.10101\n10.1179/1753555714Y.0000000159\n10.1002/adhm.201500197\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2004.08.014\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.021\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036336\n10.1002/adhm.201200159\n10.1080/10255842.2013.774384\n10.1023/B:JMSM.0000004006.90399.b4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.10.032\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.008\n10.1002/jbm.a.10111\n10.1016/0014-4827(86)90217-X\n10.1002/aja.1001860208\n10.1111/clr.12503\n10.1016/j.msec.2008.11.014\n10.1186/s13036-015-0001-4\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00243-5\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1988.tb38515.x\n10.3390/ma2041674\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00174-5\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.01.004\n10.1002/term.1729\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2003.08.003\n10.1016/j.jmps.2010.04.008\n10.1038/nmat2316\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.05.020\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.012\n10.1007/s10856-008-3668-y\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.020\n10.1007/s10237-014-0577-5\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.056\n10.1007/s10856-005-6988-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.019\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00148-5\n10.1529/biophysj.103.039495\n10.1002/jbm.820040309\n10.1163/156856201744489\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199707)36:1<17::AID-JBM3>3.3.CO;2-D\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00672-X\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.11.014\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.002\n10.1007/s10439-013-0748-z\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.052\n10.1016/j.msec.2009.08.010\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00030-9\n10.1007/s10856-005-4716-5\n10.1023/A:1008973120918\n10.1016/S8756-3282(98)00030-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.028\n10.1111/j.1708-8208.2007.00031.x\n10.3390/ma3010026\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.040\n10.1016/S0167-577X(02)01002-9\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02736.x\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03087.x\n10.1073/pnas.0502575102\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.11.024\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.013\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.01.009\n10.1098/rsif.2013.0958\n10.1016/0021-9290(94)00035-2\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.040\n10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.00912.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.01.050\n10.1002/jbm.1286\n10.1016/S0109-5641(03)00024-1\n10.1002/jbm.a.30682\n10.1098/rsif.2008.0064\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.06.033\n10.1111/cid.12033\n10.1002/jbm.b.30291\n10.1002/jbmr.278\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.010\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.250.151\n10.1140/epje/i2002-10161-6\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.04.003\n10.1002/jor.1100170110\n10.1038/nmat3025\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00290-8\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021589\n10.1016/j.bone.2007.10.009\n10.1098/rsif.2013.0263\n10.1016/S0021-9290(02)00233-6\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00191-6\n10.1016/j.msec.2005.01.014\n10.1083/jcb.201210152\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1297\n10.1039/c4bm00291a\n10.1016/j.ces.2004.04.028\n10.1038/nature09765"}

These advantages partially explain the abundance and variety of discontinuous fibre composites that have evolved in the natural world. Many natural structures out-perform the conventional synthetic counterparts due, in part, to the more elaborate reinforcement architectures that occur in natural composites. Here we present an additive manufacturing approach that combines real-time colloidal assembly with existing additive manufacturing technologies to create highly programmable discontinuous fibre composites. This technology, termed as '3D magnetic printing', has enabled us to recreate complex bioinspired reinforcement architectures that deliver enhanced material performance compared with monolithic structures. Further, we demonstrate that we can now design and evolve elaborate reinforcement architectures that are not found in nature, demonstrating a high level of possible customization in discontinuous fibre composites with arbitrary geometries.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["Joshua JMartin", "Brad EFiore", "Randall MErb"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms9641"}
{"title": "3D printing with polymers: Challenges among expanding options and opportunities.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing, which is more colloquially referred to as 3D printing, is quickly approaching mainstream adoption as a highly flexible processing technique that can be applied to plastic, metal, ceramic, concrete and other building materials. However, taking advantage of the tremendous versatility associated with in situ photopolymerization as well as the ability to select from a variety of preformed processible polymers, 3D printing predominantly targets the production of polymeric parts and models. The goal of this review is to connect the various additive manufacturing techniques with the monomeric and polymeric materials they use while highlighting emerging material-based developments.\nModern additive manufacturing technology was introduced approximately three decades ago but this review compiles recent peer-reviewed literature reports to demonstrate the evolution underway with respect to the various building techniques that differ significantly in approach as well as the new variations in polymer-based materials being employed.\nRecent growth of 3D printing has been dramatic and the ability of the various platform technologies to expand from rapid production prototypic models to the greater volume of readily customizable production of working parts is critical for continued high growth rates. This transition to working part production is highly dependent on adapting materials that deliver not only the requisite design accuracy but also the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the application.\nWith the weighty distinction of being called the next industrial revolution, 3D printing technologies is already altering many industrial and academic operations including changing models for future healthcare delivery in medicine and dentistry.", "journal": "Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials", "date": "2015-10-24", "authors": ["Jeffrey WStansbury", "Mike JIdacavage"], "doi": "10.1016/j.dental.2015.09.018"}

However, ubiquitous testing procedures have yet to be implemented in these areas, necessitating a simple, rapid, and accurate testing platform to diagnose sickle cell disease. Here, we present a label-free, sensitive, and specific testing platform using only a small blood sample (<1 \u03bcl) based on the higher density of sickle red blood cells under deoxygenated conditions. Testing is performed with a lightweight and compact 3D-printed attachment installed on a commercial smartphone. This attachment includes an LED to illuminate the sample, an optical lens to magnify the image, and two permanent magnets for magnetic levitation of red blood cells. The sample is suspended in a paramagnetic medium with sodium metabisulfite and loaded in a microcapillary tube that is inserted between the magnets. Red blood cells are levitated in the magnetic field based on equilibrium between the magnetic and buoyancy forces acting on the cells.

{"title": "An accurate projector calibration method based on polynomial distortion representation.", "abstract": "In structure light measurement systems or 3D printing systems, the errors caused by optical distortion of a digital projector always affect the precision performance and cannot be ignored. Existing methods to calibrate the projection distortion rely on calibration plate and photogrammetry, so the calibration performance is largely affected by the quality of the plate and the imaging system. This paper proposes a new projector calibration approach that makes use of photodiodes to directly detect the light emitted from a digital projector. By analyzing the output sequence of the photoelectric module, the pixel coordinates can be accurately obtained by the curve fitting method. A polynomial distortion representation is employed to reduce the residuals of the traditional distortion representation model. Experimental results and performance evaluation show that the proposed calibration method is able to avoid most of the disadvantages in traditional methods and achieves a higher accuracy.

{"title": "Bioprinting of human pluripotent stem cells and their directed differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells for the generation of mini-livers in 3D.", "abstract": "We report the first investigation into the bioprinting of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), their response to a valve-based printing process as well as their post-printing differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). HLCs differentiated from both hiPSCs and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) sources were bioprinted and examined for the presence of hepatic markers to further validate the compatibility of the valve-based bioprinting process with fragile cell transfer. Examined cells were positive for nuclear factor 4 alpha and were demonstrated to secrete albumin and have morphology that was also found to be similar to that of hepatocytes. Both hESC and hiPSC lines were tested for post-printing viability and pluripotency and were found to have negligible difference in terms of viability and pluripotency between the printed and non-printed cells. hESC-derived HLCs were 3D printed using alginate hydrogel matrix and tested for viability and albumin secretion during the remaining differentiation and were found to be hepatic in nature. 3D printed with 40-layer of HLC-containing alginate structures reached peak albumin secretion at day 21 of the differentiation protocol. This work demonstrates that the valve-based printing process is gentle enough to print human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (both hESCs and hiPSCs) while either maintaining their pluripotency or directing their differentiation into specific lineages. The ability to bioprint hPSCs will pave the way for producing organs or tissues on demand from patient specific cells which could be used for animal-free drug development and personalized medicine.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-10-22", "authors": ["AlanFaulkner-Jones", "CatherineFyfe", "Dirk-JanCornelissen", "JohnGardner", "JasonKing", "AidanCourtney", "WenmiaoShu"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/044102"}

The utilization of digital light processing system for additive manufacturing machine in laboratory scale was performed in order to fabricate the hydroxyapatite scaffold, of which biocompatibilities were eventually evaluated by direct contact and cell-culturing tests.

The filaments were engineered into capsule-shaped tablets (caplets) containing 9mg budesonide using a FDM 3D printer; the caplets were then overcoated with a layer of enteric polymer. The final printed formulation was tested in a dynamic dissolution bicarbonate buffer system, and two commercial budesonide products, Cortiment\u00ae (Uceris\u00ae) and Entocort\u00ae, were also investigated for comparison. Budesonide release from the Entocort\u00ae formulation was rapid in conditions of the upper small intestine while release from the Cortiment\u00ae product was more delayed and very slow. In contrast, the new 3D printed caplet formulation started to release in the mid-small intestine but release then continued in a sustained manner throughout the distal intestine and colon.

Generally, those scaffolds with a single type of macropore have relatively low porosity and pore surfaces, limited delivery of oxygen and nutrition to surviving cells, and new bone tissue formation in the center of the scaffolds. Therefore, in this work, we present a useful and facile method for preparing hollow-struts-packed (HSP) bioceramic scaffolds with designed macropores and multioriented hollow channels via a modified coaxial 3D printing strategy. The prepared HSP scaffolds combined high porosity and surface area with impressive mechanical strength. The unique hollow-struts structures of bioceramic scaffolds significantly improved cell attachment and proliferation and further promoted formation of new bone tissue in the center of the scaffolds, indicating that HSP ceramic scaffolds can be used for regeneration of large bone defects.

Each device was loaded with multiple actives, with the intent of applying this process to the production of personalized medicines tailored at the point of dispensing or use. A filament extruder was used to obtain drug-loaded--paracetamol (acetaminophen) or caffeine--filaments of poly(vinyl alcohol) with characteristics suitable for use in fused-deposition modeling 3D printing. A multinozzle 3D printer enabled fabrication of capsule-shaped solid devices containing the drug with different internal structures. The design configurations included a multilayer device, with each layer containing drug, whose identity was different to the drug in the adjacent layers, and a two-compartment device comprising a caplet embedded within a larger caplet (DuoCaplet), with each compartment containing a different drug. Raman spectroscopy was used to collect 2-dimensional hyper spectral arrays across the entire surface of the devices. Processing of the arrays using direct classical least-squares component matching to produce false color representations of distribution of the drugs was used. This clearly showed a definitive separation between the drug layers of paracetamol and caffeine. Drug release tests in biorelevant bicarbonate media showed unique drug release profiles dependent on the macrostructure of the devices. In the case of the multilayer devices, release of both paracetamol and caffeine was simultaneous and independent of drug solubility. With the DuoCaplet design, it was possible to engineer either rapid drug release or delayed release by selecting the site of incorporation of the drug in the device; the lag-time for release from the internal compartment was dependent on the characteristics of the external layer.

A study was performed to assess their effectiveness against cadaveric materials for learning external cardiac anatomy. A double blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken on undergraduate medical students without prior formal cardiac anatomy teaching. Following a pre-test examining baseline external cardiac anatomy knowledge, participants were randomly assigned to three groups who underwent self-directed learning sessions using either cadaveric materials, 3D prints, or a combination of cadaveric materials/3D prints (combined materials). Participants were then subjected to a post-test written by a third party. Fifty-two participants completed the trial; 18 using cadaveric materials, 16 using 3D models, and 18 using combined materials. Age and time since completion of high school were equally distributed between groups. Pre-test scores were not significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.231), however, post-test scores were significantly higher for 3D prints group compared to the cadaveric materials or combined materials groups (mean of 60.83% vs. 44.81% and 44.62%, P\u2009=\u20090.010, adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.012). A significant improvement in test scores was detected for the 3D prints group (P\u2009=\u20090.003) but not for the other two groups. The finding of this pilot study suggests that use of 3D prints do not disadvantage students relative to cadaveric materials; maximally, results suggest that 3D may confer certain benefits to anatomy learning and supports their use and ongoing evaluation as supplements to cadaver-based curriculums.

Therefore, this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review, including vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In addition, the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery, which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly, three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore, bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues.

In this study, mechanical tests including three-point bending and ultimate tensile strength were conducted to evaluate the optimal ratio of iron oxide nanoparticles in the PLLA composite. Both injection molding and 3D printing techniques were used to fabricate the PLLA bone screws with and without the iron oxide nanoparticles. The fabricated screws were implanted into the femoral condyles of New Zealand White rabbits. Bone blocks containing the PLLA screws were resected 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Histologic examination of the surrounding bone and the radiopacity of the iron-oxide-containing PLLA screws were evaluated. Our results indicated that addition of iron oxide nanoparticles at 30% significantly decreased the ultimate tensile stress properties of the PLLA screws. The screws with 20% iron oxide exhibited strong radiopacity compared to the screws fabricated without the iron oxide nanoparticles. Four weeks after surgery, the average bone volume of the iron oxide PLLA composite screws was significantly greater than that of PLLA screws without iron oxide.

The aim of the experiment was studying the interactions between MT and HA-derived peptides.

Using this method, we can effectively control the growth patterns of cells. Compared with these traditional methods which employ digital dynamic mask, polymerization of PEGDA solution can be used to create arbitrary shaped microstructures with high efficiency, flexibility and repeatability. The duration of UV exposure is less than 10\u00a0s through controlling the projected illumination pattern. The ability of patterned PEGDA-coated film to hinder cell adhesion makes it possible to control area over which cells attach. In our experiments, we take advantage of the blank area to pattern cells, which allows cells to grow in various pre-designed shapes and sizes.

At surgery, a huge tumor in the interatrial septum was confirmed. By incision on the atrial roof between the aorta and SVC, tumor enucleation was performed successfully under CPB.

It can be used to fabricate skull models or study models, as well as to make replica teeth in autotransplantation or tooth impaction cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of fabrication of replica teeth made by two types of 3D printing technologies.\nFifty extracted molar teeth were selected as samples. They were scanned to generate high-resolution 3D surface model stereolithography files. These files were converted into physical models using two types of 3D printing technologies: Fused deposition modeling (FDM) and PolyJet technology. All replica teeth were scanned and 3D images generated. Computer software compared the replica teeth to the original teeth with linear measurements, volumetric measurements, and mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment. Paired t-tests were used to statistically analyze the measurements.\nMost measurements of teeth formed using FDM tended to be slightly smaller, while those of the PolyJet replicas tended to be slightly larger, than those of the extracted teeth. Mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment of FDM and PolyJet group were 0.047 mm and 0.038 mm, respectively. Although there were statistically significant differences, they were regarded as clinically insignificant.\nThis study confirms that FDM and PolyJet technologies are accurate enough to be usable in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment.", "journal": "Korean journal of orthodontics", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["Keun-YoungLee", "Jin-WooCho", "Na-YoungChang", "Jong-MoonChae", "Kyung-HwaKang", "Sang-CheolKim", "Jin-HyoungCho"], "doi": "10.4041/kjod.2015.45.5.217"}

Here we report the cell growth and functional behavior of SCs on \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) scaffolds arranged in 3D printed-lattice (P-\u03b2-TCP) and randomly-porous, template-casted (N-\u03b2-TCP) structures. Our results indicate that SCs proliferated well and expressed the phenotypic markers p75LNGFR and the S100-\u03b2 subunit of SCs as well as displayed growth morphology on both scaffolds, but SCs showed spindle-shaped morphology with a significant degree of SCs alignment on the P-\u03b2-TCP scaffolds, seen to a lesser degree in the N-\u03b2-TCP scaffold. The gene expressions of nerve growth factor (\u03b2-ngf), neutrophin-3 (nt-3), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf-bb), and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf-a) were higher at day 7 than at day 14. While no significant differences in protein secretion were measured between these last two time points, the scaffolds promoted the protein secretion at day 3 compared to that on the cell culture plates. These results together imply that the \u03b2-TCP scaffolds can support SC cell growth and that the 3D-printed scaffold appeared to significantly promote the alignment of SCs along the struts.

{"title": "Topological design of all-ceramic dental bridges for enhancing fracture resistance.", "abstract": "Layered all-ceramic systems have been increasingly adopted in major dental prostheses. However, ceramics are inherently brittle, and they often subject to premature failure under high occlusion forces especially in the posterior region. This study aimed to develop mechanically sound novel topological designs for all-ceramic dental bridges by minimizing the fracture incidence under given loading conditions. A bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique is implemented within the extended finite element method (XFEM) framework. Extended finite element method allows modeling crack initiation and propagation inside all-ceramic restoration systems. Following this, BESO searches the optimum distribution of two different ceramic materials, namely porcelain and zirconia, for minimizing fracture incidence. A performance index, as per a ratio of peak tensile stress to material strength, is used as a design objective. In this study, the novel XFEM based BESO topology optimization significantly improved structural strength by minimizing performance index for suppressing fracture incidence in the structures. As expected, the fracture resistance and factor of safety of fixed partial dentures structure increased upon redistributing zirconia and porcelain in the optimal topological configuration. Dental CAD/CAM systems and the emerging 3D printing technology were commercially available to facilitate implementation of such a computational design, exhibiting considerable potential for clinical application in the future.

Various synthetic and natural hydrogels with key characteristics, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, printability and crosslinkability, have been employed as ink materials in bioprinting. Choosing the right cell-containing \"bioink\" material is the most essential step for fabricating 3-D constructs with a controlled mechanical and biochemical microenvironment that can lead to successful tissue regeneration and repair. Here, we demonstrate that the genetically engineered M13 phage holds great potential for use as a versatile nanoink for printing 3-D cell-laden matrices. In particular, M13 phages displaying integrin-binding (GRGDS) and calcium-binding (DDYD) domains on their surface were blended with alginate to successfully form Ca(2+)-crosslinked hydrogels. Furthermore, 3-D cell-laden scaffolds with high cell viability were generated after optimizing the printing process. The MC3T3-E1 cells within these scaffolds showed enhanced proliferation and differentiation rates that increased proportionally with the concentration of phages in the 3-D matrices compared with the rates of cells in pure alginate scaffolds.\nBioprinting is an emerging technology for producing tissue-mimetic 3-D structures using cell-containing hydrogels called bioink. Choosing the right bioink is essential for fabricating 3-D structures with controlled mechanical and biochemical properties which lead to successful tissue regeneration. Therefore, there is a growing demand for a new bioink material that can be designed from molecular level.

A key requirement for the clinical success of the bioactive ceramics is the match of the mechanical behavior of the implants with the specific bone tissue to be filled. This raises the question as to what design strategy might be the best indicators for the balance between mechanical properties and biological performances. Here we go beyond the traditional approaches that use phase conversion or biphasic hybrid; instead, we achieved a simultaneous enhancement of several mechanical parameters and optimalization of biodegradability by using a dilute doping of Mg in a single-phase wollastonite bioceramic. We show that the wollastonite ceramic can be rationally tuned in phase (\u03b1 or \u03b2), mechanical strength (in compression and bending mode), elastic modulus (18-23GPa), and fracture toughness (>3.2MPam(1/2)) through the usage of Mg dopant introduced at precisely defined dilute concentrations (Mg/Ca molar ratio: 1.2-2.1%). Meanwhile, the dilute Mg-doped wollastonite ceramics are shown to exhibit good bioactivity in vitro in SBF but biodegradation in Tris is inversely proportional to Mg content.

Targeted prostate biopsy was performed with the use of prostate 3D reconstruction modeling, computer-simulated biopsy, 3D printing, and cognitive fusion biopsy. All patients had received 3.0\u00a0T multiparametric MRI before biopsy. The DICOM MRI files were imported to medical imaging processing software for 3D reconstruction modeling to generate a printable .stl file for 3D printing with use of transparent resin as raw material. We further performed a targeted 2- to 3-core biopsy at suspected lesions spotted on MRI.\nFor the 16 patients in the present study, 3D modeling with cognitive fusion-based targeted biopsy was successfully performed. For a single patient, 1-2 lesions (average: 1.1 lesions) were discovered, followed by 2-6 cores (average: 2.4 cores) added as targeted biopsy. Systematic biopsies accounted for 192 cores in total, with a positive rate of 22.4%; targeted biopsies accounted for 39 cores in total, with a positive rate of 46.2%. Among these cases, 10 patients (62.5%) were diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma, in which seven were discovered by both systematic and targeted biopsy, one was diagnosed by systematic biopsy only, and two were diagnosed by targeted biopsy only. For systematic biopsy, Gleason score ranged from 6 to 8 (average: 7), while that for targeted biopsy ranged from 6 to 9 (average: 7.67).

To control the viscosity and improve the mechanical properties of the PPF, diethyl fumarate (DEF) was mixed with the polymer.

The present study compares three different blood product supplements for improved cell proliferation and protection against DNA damage in cultured human dental pulp stem cells for tooth TE applications. Human cells from dental pulp were first characterized as adult stem cells (ectomesenchymal mixed origin) by flow cytometry. Next, four different cell culture conditions were tested: I, supplement-free; II, supplemented with fetal bovine serum; III, allogeneic human serum; and IV, autologous human serum. Cultured cells were then characterized for cell proliferation, mineralized nodule formation, and colony-forming units (CFU) capability. After 28 days in culture, the comet assay was performed to assess possible damage in cellular DNA. Our results revealed that Protocol IV achieved higher cell proliferation than Protocol I (p = 0.0112). Protocols II and III resulted in higher cell proliferation than Protocol I, but no statistical differences were found relative to Protocol IV. The comet assay revealed less cell damage in cells cultured using Protocol IV as compared to Protocols II and III. The damage percentage observed on Protocol II was significantly higher than all other protocols. CFUs capability was highest using Protocol IV (p = 0.0018) and III, respectively, and the highest degree of mineralization was observed using Protocol IV as compared to Protocols II and III.

The combination of PA coating and alignment-inducing functionalised substrates provided a template to instruct human corneal stromal fibroblasts to adhere, become aligned and then bio-fabricate a highly-ordered, multi-layered, three-dimensional tissue by depositing an aligned, native-like extracellular matrix. The newly-formed corneal tissue equivalent was subsequently able to eliminate the adhesive properties of the template and govern its own complete release via the action of endogenous proteases. Tissues recovered through this method were structurally stable, easily handled, and carrier-free. Furthermore, topographical and mechanical analysis by atomic force microscopy showed that tissue equivalents formed on the alignment-inducing PA template had highly-ordered, compact collagen deposition, with a two-fold higher elastic modulus compared to the less compact tissues produced on the non-alignment template,\u00a0the PA-coated glass.

Here we describe a cell-printing method to obtain mechanically reinforced multi-layered cell-embedded scaffolds, formed of micron-scale poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)/alginate struts coated with alginate-based bioink. To compare the physical and cellular activities, we used a scaffold composed of pure alginate (without cells) coated PCL/alginate struts as a control. We systematically varied the ratio of alginate cross-linking agent, and determined the optimal cell-coating conditions to form the PCL/alginate struts. Following fabrication of the cell (MG63)-laden PCL/alginate scaffold, the bioactivity was evaluated in vitro. The laden cells exhibited a substantially more developed cytoskeleton compared with those on a control scaffold consisting of the same material composition. Based on these results, the printed cells exhibited a significantly more homogenous distribution within the scaffold compared with the control. Cell proliferation was determined via MTT assays at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of culture, and the proliferation of the cell-printed scaffold was substantially in excess (\u223c2.4-fold) of that on the control.

Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of using cell-free porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) graft implants (PGIs) along with early loading exercise to repair a full-thickness osteochondral defect. Rabbits were randomly allocated to a treadmill exercise (TRE) group or a sedentary (SED) group and were prepared as either a PGI model or an empty defect (ED) model. TRE was performed as a short-term loading exercise; SED was physical inactivity in a free cage. The knees were evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. At the end of testing, none of the knees developed synovitis, formed osteophytes, or became infected. Macroscopically, the PGI-TRE group regenerated a smooth articular surface, with transparent new hyaline-like tissue soundly integrated with the neighboring cartilage, but the other groups remained distinct at the margins with fibrous or opaque tissues. In a micro-CT analysis, the synthesized bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher in the PGI-TRE group, which also had integrating architecture in the regeneration site. The thickness of the trabecular (subchondral) bone was improved in all groups from 6 to 12 weeks. Histologically, remarkable differences in the cartilage regeneration were visible. At week 6, compared with SED groups, the TRE groups manifested modest inflammatory cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), improved collagen alignment and higher glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, particularly in the PGI-TRE group. At week 12, the PGI-TRE group had the best regeneration outcomes, showing the formation of hyaline-like cartilage, the development of columnar rounded chondrocytes that expressed enriched levels of collagen type II and GAG, and functionalized trabecular bone with osteocytes. In summary, the combination of implanting cell-free PLGA and performing an early loading exercise can significantly promote the full-thickness osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knee joint models.\nPromoting effective hyaline cartilage regeneration rather than fibrocartilage scar tissue remains clinically challenging. To address the obstacle, we fabricated a spongy cell-free PLGA scaffold, and designed a reasonable exercise program to generate combined therapeutic effects. First, the implanting scaffold generates an affordable mechanical structure to bear the loading forces and bridge with the host to offer a space in the full-thickness osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knee joint. After implantation, rabbits were performed by an early treadmill exercise 15 min/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks that directly exerts in situ endogenous growth factor and anti-inflammatory effects in the reparative site.

While many studies have investigated local delivery of biologics as a restorative approach, an increasing body of evidence highlights the contribution of the mechanical properties of implanted scaffolds to wound healing. In the present study, we designed poly(ester urethane) scaffolds using a templated-Fused Deposition Modeling (t-FDM) process to test the hypothesis that scaffolds with substrate modulus comparable to that of collagen fibers enhance a regenerative versus a fibrotic response. We fabricated t-FDM scaffolds with substrate moduli varying from 5 to 266 MPa to investigate the effects of substrate modulus on healing in a rat subcutaneous implant model. Angiogenesis, cellular infiltration, collagen deposition, and directional variance of collagen fibers were maximized for wounds treated with scaffolds having a substrate modulus (Ks = 24 MPa) comparable to that of collagen fibers. The enhanced regenerative response in these scaffolds was correlated with down-regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in fibroblasts, as well as increased polarization of macrophages toward the restorative M2 phenotype. These observations highlight the substrate modulus of the scaffold as a key parameter regulating the regenerative versus scarring phenotype in wound healing. Our findings further point to the potential use of scaffolds with substrate moduli tuned to that of the native matrix as a therapeutic approach to improve cutaneous healing.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-09-26", "authors": ["RGuo", "A RMerkel", "J ASterling", "J MDavidson", "S AGuelcher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.09.005"}

The technology combines an aqueous-based slip-casting process with magnetically directed particle assembly to create programmed microstructural designs using anisotropic stiff platelets in a ceramic, metal or polymer functional matrix. Using quantitative tools to control the casting kinetics and the temporal pattern of the applied magnetic fields, we demonstrate that this approach is robust and can be exploited to design and fabricate heterogeneous composites with thus far inaccessible microstructures.

{"title": "Light-Induced Surface Patterning of Silica.", "abstract": "Manipulating the size and shape of silica precursor patterns using simple far-field light irradiation and transforming such reconfigured structures into inorganic silica patterns by pyrolytic conversion are demonstrated. The key concept of our work is the use of an azobenzene incorporated silica precursor (herein, we refer to this material as azo-silane composite) as ink in a micromolding process. The moving direction of azo-silane composite is parallel to light polarization direction; in addition, the amount of azo-silane composite movement can be precisely determined by controlling light irradiation time. By exploiting this peculiar phenomenon, azo-silane composite patterns produced using the micromolding technique are arbitrarily manipulated to obtain various structural features including high-resolution size or sophisticated shape. The photoreconfigured patterns formed with azo-silane composites are then converted into pure silica patterns through pyrolytic conversion. The pyrolytic converted silica patterns are uniformly formed over a large area, ensuring crack-free formation and providing high structural fidelity. Therefore, this optical manipulation technique, in conjunction with the pyrolytic conversion process, opens a promising route to the design of silica patterns with finely tuned structural features in terms of size and shape.

{"title": "Stimulatory effects of the fast setting and suitable degrading Ca-Si-Mg cement on both cementogenesis and angiogenesis differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop a fast setting and suitable degrading Mg-calcium silicate cement (Mg-CS) and a mechanism using Mg ions to stimulate human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). Mechanical strength and stability have been determined by testing the diametral tensile strength; the degradation of cements has been measured by ascertaining the number of ions released in simulated body fluid. Other cell characteristics such as proliferation, differentiation and mineralization, and hPDLCs when cultured on cement surfaces were also examined. The results show that the degradation rate of Mg-CS cements depends on the Mg content in CS. Regarding in vitro bioactivity, the CS cements were covered with clusters of apatite spherulites after immersion for 30 days, while there was less formation of apatite spherulites on the Mg-rich cement surfaces. In addition, researchers also explored the effects of Mg ions on the cementogenesis and angiogenesis differentiation of hPDLCs in comparison with pure CS cement. The proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, cementogenesis-related proteins (CEMP1 and CAP), and angiogenesis-related protein (vWF and ang-1) secretion of hPDLCs were significantly stimulated when the Mg ion concentration of the medium was increased. The research results also suggest that Mg-CS cements with this modified composition stimulate hPDLC behaviour and so may be good biomaterials for bone substitutes and hard tissue regeneration applications as they stimulate cementogenesis/angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

In the future, many items may be manufactured at home, which raises two ethical issues. First, there are questions of safety. Our current safety regulations depend on centralized manufacturing assumptions; they will be difficult to enforce on this new model of manufacturing. Using current US law as an example, I argue that consumers are not capable of fully assessing all relevant risks and thus continue to require protection; any regulation will likely apply to plans, however, not physical objects. Second, there are intellectual property issues. In combination with a 3D scanner, it is now possible to scan items and print copies; many items are not protected from this by current intellectual property laws.

{"title": "A novel tool to standardize rheology testing of molten polymers for pharmaceutical applications.", "abstract": "Melt rheology provides information about material properties that are of great importance for equipment design and simulations, especially for novel pharmaceutical manufacturing operations, including extrusion, injection molding or 3d printing. To that end, homogeneous samples must be prepared, most commonly via compression or injection molding, both of which require costly equipment and might not be applicable for shear- and heat-sensitive pharmaceutical materials. Our study introduces a novel vacuum compression molding (VCM) tool for simple preparation of thermoplastic specimens using standard laboratory equipment: a hot plate and a vacuum source. Sticking is eliminated by applying polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated separation foils. The evacuation of the tool leads to compression of the sample chamber, which is cost-efficient compared to conventional methods, such as compression molding or injection molding that require special equipment. In addition, this compact design reduces the preparation time and the heat load. The VCM tool was used to prepare samples for a rheological study of three pharmaceutical polymers (Soluplus(\u00ae), Eudragit(\u00ae)E, EVA Rowalit(\u00ae) 300-1/28). The prepared samples were without any air inclusions or voids, and the measurements had a high reproducibility. All relative standard deviations were below 3%.

In addition, cells within the osteochondral tissue are in intimate contact with a 3D nanostructured extracellular matrix composed of numerous bioactive organic and inorganic components. As an emerging manufacturing technique, 3D printing offers great precision and control over the microarchitecture, shape and composition of tissue scaffolds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a biomimetic 3D printed nanocomposite scaffold with integrated differentiation cues for improved osteochondral tissue regeneration. Through the combination of novel nano-inks composed of organic and inorganic bioactive factors and advanced 3D printing, we have successfully fabricated a series of novel constructs which closely mimic the native 3D extracellular environment with hierarchical nanoroughness, microstructure and spatiotemporal bioactive cues.

This study addresses that challenge with a novel spheroid assay, wherein spheroids, formed by magnetic 3D bioprinting, contract immediately as cells rearrange and compact the spheroid in relation to viability and cytoskeletal organization. Thus, spheroid size can be used as a simple metric for toxicity. The goal of this study was to validate spheroid contraction as a cytotoxic endpoint using 3T3 fibroblasts in response to 5 toxic compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, 5'-fluorouracil, forskolin), sodium dodecyl sulfate (+control), and penicillin-G (-control). Real-time imaging was performed with a mobile device to increase throughput and efficiency. All compounds but penicillin-G significantly slowed contraction in a dose-dependent manner (Z'\u2009=\u20090.88). Cells in 3D were more resistant to toxicity than cells in 2D, whose toxicity was measured by the MTT assay. Fluorescent staining and gene expression profiling of spheroids confirmed these findings.

{"title": "Nanothin Coculture Membranes with Tunable Pore Architecture and Thermoresponsive Functionality for Transfer-Printable Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Sheets.", "abstract": "Coculturing stem cells with the desired cell type is an effective method to promote the differentiation of stem cells. The features of the membrane used for coculturing are crucial to achieving the best outcome. Not only should the membrane act as a physical barrier that prevents the mixing of the cocultured cell populations, but it should also allow effective interactions between the cells. Unfortunately, conventional membranes used for coculture do not sufficiently meet these requirements. In addition, cell harvesting using proteolytic enzymes following coculture impairs cell viability and the extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by the cultured cells. To overcome these limitations, we developed nanothin and highly porous (NTHP) membranes, which are \u223c20-fold thinner and \u223c25-fold more porous than the conventional coculture membranes. The tunable pore size of NTHP membranes at the nanoscale level was found crucial for the formation of direct gap junctions-mediated contacts between the cocultured cells. Differentiation of the cocultured stem cells was dramatically enhanced with the pore size-customized NTHP membrane system compared to conventional coculture methods. This was likely due to effective physical contacts between the cocultured cells and the fast diffusion of bioactive molecules across the membrane. Also, the thermoresponsive functionality of the NTHP membranes enabled the efficient generation of homogeneous, ECM-preserved, highly viable, and transfer-printable sheets of cardiomyogenically differentiated cells. The coculture platform developed in this study would be effective for producing various types of therapeutic multilayered cell sheets that can be differentiated from stem cells.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2015-09-13", "authors": ["SeungmiRyu", "JinYoo", "YeongseonJang", "JinHan", "Seung JungYu", "JooyeonPark", "Seon YeopJung", "Kyung HyunAhn", "Sung GapIm", "KookheonChar", "Byung-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.5b03823"}

{"title": "Bioactive glass-reinforced bioceramic ink writing scaffolds: sintering, microstructure and mechanical behavior.", "abstract": "The densification of pore struts in bioceramic scaffolds is important for structure stability and strength reliability. An advantage of ceramic ink writing is the precise control over the microstructure and macroarchitecture. However, the use of organic binder in such ink writing process would heavily affect the densification of ceramic struts and sacrifice the mechanical strength of porous scaffolds after sintering. This study presents a low-melt-point bioactive glass (BG)-assisted sintering strategy to overcome the main limitations of direct ink writing (extrusion-based three-dimensional printing) and to produce high-strength calcium silicate (CSi) bioceramic scaffolds. The 1% BG-added CSi (CSi-BG1) scaffolds with rectangular pore morphology sintered at 1080 \u00b0C have a very small BG content, readily induce apatite formation, and show appreciable linear shrinkage (\u223c21%), which is consistent with the composite scaffolds with less or more BG contents sintered at either the same or a higher temperature. These CSi-BG1 scaffolds also possess a high elastic modulus (\u223c350 MPa) and appreciable compressive strength (\u223c48 MPa), and show significant strength enhancement after exposure to simulated body fluid-a performance markedly superior to those of pure CSi scaffolds. Particularly, the honeycomb-pore CSi-BG1 scaffolds show markedly higher compressive strength (\u223c88 MPa) than the scaffolds with rectangular, parallelogram, and Archimedean chord pore structures.

{"title": "Feather roughness reduces flow separation during low Reynolds number glides of swifts.", "abstract": "Swifts are aerodynamically sophisticated birds with a small arm and large hand wing that provides them with exquisite control over their glide performance. However, their hand wings have a seemingly unsophisticated surface roughness that is poised to disturb flow. This roughness of about 2% chord length is formed by the valleys and ridges of overlapping primary feathers with thick protruding rachides, which make the wing stiffer. An earlier flow study of laminar-turbulent boundary layer transition over prepared swift wings suggested that swifts can attain laminar flow at a low angle of attack. In contrast, aerodynamic design theory suggests that airfoils must be extremely smooth to attain such laminar flow. In hummingbirds, which have similarly rough wings, flow measurements on a 3D printed model suggest that the flow separates at the leading edge and becomes turbulent well above the rachis bumps in a detached shear layer. The aerodynamic function of wing roughness in small birds is, therefore, not fully understood. Here, we performed particle image velocimetry and force measurements to compare smooth versus rough 3D-printed models of the swift hand wing. The high-resolution boundary layer measurements show that the flow over rough wings is indeed laminar at a low angle of attack and a low Reynolds number, but becomes turbulent at higher values. In contrast, the boundary layer over the smooth wing forms open laminar separation bubbles that extend beyond the trailing edge. The boundary layer dynamics of the smooth surface varies non-linearly as a function of angle of attack and Reynolds number, whereas the rough surface boasts more consistent turbulent boundary layer dynamics.

{"title": "Sequential Self-Folding Structures by 3D Printed Digital Shape Memory Polymers.", "abstract": "Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological applications including packaging of solar cells and space structures, deployable biomedical devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags. Here we demonstrate sequential self-folding structures realized by thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns that are 3D printed with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials with different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each polymer allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure is subjected to a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series of 3D printed structures that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and self-fold to specified shapes in controlled shape changing sequences. Measurements of the spatial and temporal nature of self-folding structures are in good agreement with the companion finite element simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to rapidly and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important aspect of self-folding is the management of self-collisions, where different portions of the folding structure contact and then block further folding. A metric is developed to predict collisions and is used together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding structures that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-09-09", "authors": ["YiqiMao", "KaiYu", "Michael SIsakov", "JiangtaoWu", "Martin LDunn", "HJerry Qi"], "doi": "10.1038/srep13616\n10.1098/Rspb.1996.0241\n10.1073/Pnas.0907390106\n10.1038/ncomms4140\n10.1098/Rspa.2009.0625\n10.1098/Rspa.2011.0120\n10.1016/J.Tibtech.2011.06.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/094008\n10.1038/nmat4184\n10.1002/adma.201402026\n10.1063/1.4819837\n10.1108/Aa-07-2014-062\n10.1038/srep07422\n10.1002/adfm.200800850\n10.1039/B702524f\n10.1002/Adfm.201000052\n10.1038/Nature08863\n10.1021/Ma102279y\n10.1073/Pnas.0600079103\n10.1109/Tbme.2006.877113\n10.1002/marc.200600225\n10.1002/adma.200502266\n10.1038/Nmat1059\n10.1038/Nature03496\n10.1126/science.1110505\n10.1016/J.Biomaterials.2007.01.030\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2003.08.012\n10.1039/C1sm06564e\n10.1063/1.4880160\n10.1126/science.1252610\n10.1039/C3sm51003d\n10.1038/ncomms4066\n10.1016/J.Ijsolstr.2011.11.019\n10.1177/0021998312447647\n10.1002/adfm.201400665\n10.1007/s11043-010-9109-6\n10.1039/c0sm00487a"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional printing of human skeletal muscle cells: An interdisciplinary approach for studying biological systems.", "abstract": "Interdisciplinary exploration is vital to education in the 21st century. This manuscript outlines an innovative laboratory-based teaching method that combines elements of biochemistry/molecular biology, kinesiology/health science, computer science, and manufacturing engineering to give students the ability to better conceptualize complex biological systems. Here, we utilize technology available at most universities to print three-dimensional (3D) scale models of actual human muscle cells (myofibers) out of bioplastic materials. The same methodological approach could be applied to nearly any cell type or molecular structure. This advancement is significant because historically, two-dimensional (2D) myocellular images have proven insufficient for detailed analysis of organelle organization and morphology. 3D imaging fills this void by providing accurate and quantifiable myofiber structural data. Manipulating tangible 3D models combats 2D limitation and gives students new perspectives and alternative learning experiences that may assist their understanding. This approach also exposes learners to 1) human muscle cell extraction and isolation, 2) targeted fluorescence labeling, 3) confocal microscopy, 4) image processing (via open-source software), and 5) 3D printing bioplastic scale-models (\u00d7500 larger than the actual cells). Creating these physical models may further student's interest in the invisible world of molecular and cellular biology.

{"title": "Mechanics of additively manufactured porous biomaterials based on the rhombicuboctahedron unit cell.", "abstract": "Thanks to recent developments in additive manufacturing techniques, it is now possible to fabricate porous biomaterials with arbitrarily complex micro-architectures. Micro-architectures of such biomaterials determine their physical and biological properties, meaning that one could potentially improve the performance of such biomaterials through rational design of micro-architecture. The relationship between the micro-architecture of porous biomaterials and their physical and biological properties has therefore received increasing attention recently. In this paper, we studied the mechanical properties of porous biomaterials made from a relatively unexplored unit cell, namely rhombicuboctahedron. We derived analytical relationships that relate the micro-architecture of such porous biomaterials, i.e. the dimensions of the rhombicuboctahedron unit cell, to their elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and yield stress. Finite element models were also developed to validate the analytical solutions. Analytical and numerical results were compared with experimental data from one of our recent studies. It was found that analytical solutions and numerical results show a very good agreement particularly for smaller values of apparent density. The elastic moduli predicted by analytical and numerical models were in very good agreement with experimental observations too. While in excellent agreement with each other, analytical and numerical models somewhat over-predicted the yield stress of the porous structures as compared to experimental data. As the ratio of the vertical struts to the inclined struts, \u03b1, approaches zero and infinity, the rhombicuboctahedron unit cell respectively approaches the octahedron (or truncated cube) and cube unit cells. For those limits, the analytical solutions presented here were found to approach the analytic solutions obtained for the octahedron, truncated cube, and cube unit cells, meaning that the presented solutions are generalizations of the analytical solutions obtained for several other types of porous biomaterials.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-09-08", "authors": ["RHedayati", "MSadighi", "MMohammadi-Aghdam", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.07.013"}

{"title": "Three-dimensional printed millifluidic devices for zebrafish embryo tests.", "abstract": "Implementations of Lab-on-a-Chip technologies for in-situ analysis of small model organisms and embryos (both invertebrate and vertebrate) are attracting an increasing interest. A significant hurdle to widespread applications of microfluidic and millifluidic devices for in-situ analysis of small model organisms is the access to expensive clean room facilities and complex microfabrication technologies. Furthermore, these resources require significant investments and engineering know-how. For example, poly(dimethylsiloxane) soft lithography is still largely unattainable to the gross majority of biomedical laboratories willing to pursue development of chip-based platforms. They often turn instead to readily available but inferior classical solutions. We refer to this phenomenon as workshop-to-bench gap of bioengineering science. To tackle the above issues, we examined the capabilities of commercially available Multi-Jet Modelling (MJM) and Stereolithography (SLA) systems for low volume fabrication of optical-grade millifluidic devices designed for culture and biotests performed on millimetre-sized specimens such as zebrafish embryos. The selected 3D printing technologies spanned a range from affordable personal desktop systems to high-end professional printers. The main motivation of our work was to pave the way for off-the-shelf and user-friendly 3D printing methods in order to rapidly and inexpensively build optical-grade millifluidic devices for customized studies on small model organisms. Compared with other rapid prototyping technologies such as soft lithography and infrared laser micromachining in poly(methyl methacrylate), we demonstrate that selected SLA technologies can achieve user-friendly and rapid production of prototypes, superior feature reproduction quality, and comparable levels of optical transparency. A caution need to be, however, exercised as majority of tested SLA and MJM resins were found toxic and caused significant developmental abnormalities in zebrafish embryos. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SLA technologies can be used for rapid and accurate production of devices for biomedical research.

{"title": "Hierarchical scaffolds enhance osteogenic differentiation of human Wharton's jelly derived stem cells.", "abstract": "Hierarchical structures, constituted by polymeric nano and microfibers, have been considered promising scaffolds for tissue engineering strategies, mainly because they mimic, in some way, the complexity and nanoscale detail observed in real organs. The chondrogenic potential of these scaffolds has been previously demonstrated, but their osteogenic potential is not yet corroborated. In order to assess if a hierarchical structure, with nanoscale details incorporated, is an improved scaffold for bone tissue regeneration, we evaluate cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of human Wharton's jelly derived stem cells (hWJSCs), seeded into hierarchical fibrous scaffolds. Biological data corroborates that hierarchical fibrous scaffolds show an enhanced cell entrapment when compared to rapid prototyped scaffolds without nanofibers. Furthermore, upregulation of bone specific genes and calcium phosphate deposition confirms the successful osteogenic differentiation of hWJSCs on these scaffolds. These results support our hypothesis that a scaffold with hierarchical structure, in conjugation with hWJSCs, represents a possible feasible strategy for bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["AnaluceCanha-Gouveia", "AnaRita Costa-Pinto", "Albino MMartins", "Nuno ASilva", "SusanaFaria", "Rui ASousa", "Ant\u00f3nio JSalgado", "NunoSousa", "Rui LReis", "Nuno MNeves"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/3/035009"}
{"title": "Rheology of perfusates and fluid dynamical effects during whole organ decellularization: a perspective to individualize decellularization protocols for single organs.", "abstract": "The approach of whole organ decellularization is rapidly becoming more widespread within the tissue engineering community. Today it is well known that the effects of decellularization protocols may vary with the particular type of treated tissue. However, there are no methods known to individualize decellularization protocols while automatically ensuring a standard level of quality to minimize adverse effects on the resulting extracellular matrix. Here we follow this idea by introducing two novel components into the current practice. First, a non-invasive method for online monitoring of resulting fluid dynamical characteristics of the coronary system is demonstrated for application during the perfusion decellularization of whole hearts. Second, the observation of the underlying rheological characteristics of the perfusates is employed to detect ongoing progress and maturation of the decellularization process. Measured data were contrasted to the respective release of specific cellular components. We demonstrate rheological measurements to be capable of detecting cellular debris along with a discriminative capture of DNA and protein ratios. We demonstrate that this perfusate biomass is well correlated to the biomass loss in the extracellular matrix produced by decellularization. The appearance of biomass components in the perfusates could specifically reflect the appearance of fluid dynamical characteristics that we monitored during the decellularization process. As rheological measuring of perfusate samples can be done within minutes, without any time-consuming preparation steps, we predict this to be a promising novel analytic strategy to control decellularization protocols, in time, by the actual conditions of the processed organ.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["J\u00f6rnH\u00fclsmann", "HugAubin", "Shahbaz TBandesha", "AlexanderKranz", "Volker RStoldt", "ArturLichtenberg", "PayamAkhyari"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/3/035008"}

Many polymers and proteins have been successfully structured and patterned using this method. Type I collagen comprises a large part of the extracellular matrix for most tissue types and is a widely used cellular scaffold material for tissue engineering. Current methods for creating collagen tissue scaffolds do not allow control of local geometry on a cellular scale. This means the environment experienced by cells may be made up of the native material but unrelated to native cellular-scale structure. In this study, we present a novel method to allow multiphoton crosslinking of type I collagen with flavin mononucleotide photosensitizer. The method detailed allows full 3D printing of crosslinked structures made from unmodified type I collagen and uses only demonstrated biocompatible materials. Resolution of 1 \u03bcm for both standing lines and high-aspect ratio gaps between structures is demonstrated and complex 3D structures are fabricated.

Herein, each cell is explicitly incorporated into the geometric model as single compartmentalized metabolic structures.

The prescribed tissue model in this paper is precisely embedded within a DMD by 3D bioprinting hydrogel encapsulated liver cells into a patterned array of microchannels. A perfusing drug substrate is biotransformed by liver cells encapsulated within porous hydrogel walls. Therefore, the free and porous flow regime equations are first solved in tandem to derive the laminar velocity profile and wall shear stresses in the entire shear-mediated flow regime.

This paper is devoted to studying the influence of layer thickness and raster angle on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed PEEK. Samples with three different layer thicknesses (200, 300 and 400 \u03bcm) and raster angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0) were built using a polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) 3D printing system and their tensile, compressive and bending strengths were tested. The optimal mechanical properties of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) samples were found at a layer thickness of 300 \u03bcm and a raster angle of 0\u00b0. To evaluate the printing performance of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) samples, a comparison was made between the mechanical properties of 3D-printed polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) parts.

{"title": "3D bioprinting of neural stem cell-laden thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane hydrogel and potential in central nervous system repair.", "abstract": "The 3D bioprinting technology serves as a powerful tool for building tissue in the field of tissue engineering. Traditional 3D printing methods involve the use of heat, toxic organic solvents, or toxic photoinitiators for fabrication of synthetic scaffolds. In this study, two thermoresponsive water-based biodegradable polyurethane dispersions (PU1 and PU2) were synthesized which may form gel near 37\u00a0\u00b0C without any crosslinker. The stiffness of the hydrogel could be easily fine-tuned by the solid content of the dispersion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) were embedded into the polyurethane dispersions before gelation. The dispersions containing NSCs were subsequently printed and maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The NSCs in 25-30% PU2 hydrogels (\u223c680-2400\u00a0Pa) had excellent proliferation and differentiation but not in 25-30% PU1 hydrogels. Moreover, NSC-laden 25-30% PU2 hydrogels injected into the zebrafish embryo neural injury model could rescue the function of impaired nervous system. However, NSC-laden 25-30% PU1 hydrogels only showed a minor repair effect in the zebrafish model. In addition, the function of adult zebrafish with traumatic brain injury was rescued after implantation of the 3D-printed NSC-laden 25% PU2 constructs. Therefore, the newly developed 3D bioprinting technique involving NSCs embedded in the thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane ink offers new possibilities for future applications of 3D bioprinting in neural tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["Fu-YuHsieh", "Hsin-HuaLin", "Shan-HuiHsu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.028"}
{"title": "Adhesive strength of bone-implant interfaces and in-vivo degradation of PHB composites for load-bearing applications.", "abstract": "Aim of this study was to evaluate the response of bone to novel biodegradable polymeric composite implants in the femora of growing rats. Longitudinal observation of bone reaction at the implant site (BV/TV) as well as resorption of the implanted pins were monitored using in vivo micro-focus computed tomography (\u00b5CT). After 12, 24 and 36 weeks femora containing the implants were explanted, scanned with high resolution ex vivo \u00b5CT, and the surface roughness of the implants was measured to conclude on the ingrowth capability for bone tissue. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to observe changes on the surface of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) during degradation and cell ingrowth. Four different composites with zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and Herafill(\u00ae) were compared. After 36 weeks in vivo, none of the implants did show significant degradation. The PHB composite with ZrO2 and a high percentage (30%) of Herafill\u00ae as well as the Mg-alloy WZ21 showed the highest values of bone accumulation (increased BV/TV) around the implant. The lowest value was measured in PHB with 3% ZrO2 containing no Herafill\u00ae. Roughness measurements as well as EDX and SEM imaging could not reveal any changes on the PHB composites\u05f3 surfaces. Biomechanical parameters, such as the adhesion strength between bone and implant were determined by measuring the shear strength as well as push-out energy of the bone-implant interface. The results showed that improvement of these mechanical properties of the studied PHBs P3Z, P3Z10H and P3Z30H is necessary in order to obtain appropriate load-bearing material. The moduli of elasticity, tensile strength and strain properties of the PHB composites are close to that of bone and thus promising. Compared to clinically used PLGA, PGA and PLA materials, their additional benefit is an unchanged local pH value during degradation, which makes them well tolerated by cells and immune system.

{"title": "3D plotting of growth factor loaded calcium phosphate cement scaffolds.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing allows to widely control the geometrical features of implants. Recently, we described the fabrication of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds by 3D plotting of a storable CPC paste based on water-immiscible carrier liquid. Plotting and hardening is conducted under mild conditions allowing the (precise and local) integration of biological components. In this study, we have developed a procedure for efficient loading of growth factors in the CPC scaffolds during plotting and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), used as model proteins, were encapsulated in chitosan/dextran sulphate microparticles which could be easily mixed into the CPC paste in freeze-dried state. In order to prevent leaching of the proteins during cement setting, usually carried out by immersion in aqueous solutions, the plotted scaffolds were aged in water-saturated atmosphere (humidity). Setting in humidity avoided early loss of loaded proteins but provided sufficient amount of water to allow cement setting, as indicated by XRD analysis and mechanical testing in comparison to scaffolds set in water. Moreover, humidity-set scaffolds were characterised by altered, even improved properties: no swelling or crack formation was observed and accordingly, surface topography, total porosity and compressive modulus of the humidity-set scaffolds differed from those of the water-set counterparts. Direct cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells on the humidity-set scaffolds over 21days revealed their cytocompatibility. Maintenance of the bioactivity of VEGF during the fabrication procedure was proven in indirect and direct culture experiments with endothelial cells.\nAdditive manufacturing techniques allow the fabrication of implants with defined architecture (inner pore structure and outer shape). Especially printing technologies conducted under mild conditions allow additionally the (spatially controlled) integration of biological components such as drugs or growth factors. That enables the generation of individualized implants which can better meet the requirements of a patient and of tissue engineering constructs. To our knowledge, simultaneous printing of biological components was up to now only described for hydrogel/biopolymer-based materials which suffer from poor mechanical properties.

{"title": "A facile and low-cost micro fabrication material: flash foam.", "abstract": "Although many microfabrication methods have been reported, the preliminary replication templates used in most microfabrication still depend on the expensive and long-period photolithography. This paper explores an alternative replication templates based on a daily used material, flash foam (FF), and proposes a facile microfabrication method, flash foam stamp lithography (FFSL). When FF is exposed with a desired pattern mask, the negative of the pattern is transferred to its surface and micro structures are formed due to the shrinkage of the exposed area. As FF is commonly used in personal stamps, FFSL is very simple and cost-effective. In this paper, we demonstrated that FF is a good and low-cost template for many micro fabrication methods, such as micro casting and soft lithography. Thus, designing and fabricating micro structures at personal office immediately become possible with FFSL. Furthermore, we demonstrated that multi-scale micro structures can be easily fabricated by double exposure with FFSL. Skin textures is used as another case to demonstrate that FFSL can fabricate structures with different depth in a single exposure. As a result, FF shows a promising future in biology, and analytical chemistry, such as rapid fabrication of point of care diagnostics and microfluidic analytical devices with low cost.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["YongHe", "XiaoXiao", "YanWu", "Jian-ZhongFu"], "doi": "10.1038/srep13522"}

{"title": "Smart-Phone Based Magnetic Levitation for Measuring Densities.", "abstract": "Magnetic levitation, which uses a magnetic field to suspend objects in a fluid, is a powerful and versatile technology. We develop a compact magnetic levitation platform compatible with a smart-phone to separate micro-objects and estimate the density of the sample based on its levitation height. A 3D printed attachment is mechanically installed over the existing camera unit of a smart-phone. Micro-objects, which may be either spherical or irregular in shape, are suspended in a paramagnetic medium and loaded in a microcapillary tube which is then inserted between two permanent magnets. The micro-objects are levitated and confined in the microcapillary at an equilibrium height dependent on their volumetric mass densities (causing a buoyancy force toward the edge of the microcapillary) and magnetic susceptibilities (causing a magnetic force toward the center of the microcapillary) relative to the suspending medium. The smart-phone camera captures magnified images of the levitating micro-objects through an additional lens positioned between the sample and the camera lens cover. A custom-developed Android application then analyzes these images to determine the levitation height and estimate the density. Using this platform, we were able to separate microspheres with varying densities and calibrate their levitation heights to known densities to develop a technique for precise and accurate density estimation.

{"title": "Calling Biomarkers in Milk Using a Protein Microarray on Your Smartphone.", "abstract": "Here we present the concept of a protein microarray-based fluorescence immunoassay for multiple biomarker detection in milk extracts by an ordinary smartphone. A multiplex immunoassay was designed on a microarray chip, having built-in positive and negative quality controls. After the immunoassay procedure, the 48 microspots were labelled with Quantum Dots (QD) depending on the protein biomarker levels in the sample. QD-fluorescence was subsequently detected by the smartphone camera under UV light excitation from LEDs embedded in a simple 3D-printed opto-mechanical smartphone attachment. The somewhat aberrant images obtained under such conditions, were corrected by newly developed Android-based software on the same smartphone, and protein biomarker profiles were calculated. The indirect detection of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) in milk extracts based on altered biomarker profile of anti-rbST antibodies was selected as a real-life challenge. RbST-treated and untreated cows clearly showed reproducible treatment-dependent biomarker profiles in milk, in excellent agreement with results from a flow cytometer reference method. In a pilot experiment, anti-rbST antibody detection was multiplexed with the detection of another rbST-dependent biomarker, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Milk extract IGF-1 levels were found to be increased after rbST treatment and correlated with the results obtained from the reference method. These data clearly demonstrate the potential of the portable protein microarray concept towards simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers.

Herein we show that this technology is effective for delivery of a non-adjuvanted, inactivated, whole-virus chikungunya virus vaccine in mice, with minimal post-vaccination skin reactions. A single topical Foroderm-based vaccination induced T cell, Th1 cytokine and antibody responses, which provided complete protection against viraemia and disease after challenge with chikungunya virus. Foroderm vaccination was shown to deliver fluorescent, virus-sized beads across the epidermis, with beads subsequently detected in draining lymph nodes. Foroderm vaccination also stimulated the egress of MHC II(+) antigen presenting cells from the skin.

The scaffold design and culture conditions are crucial for the limited diffusion distance of nutrients and oxygen. In static culture, decreased cell activity and irregular distribution occur within the scaffold. Dynamic conditions entail physical stimulation and constant medium perfusion imitating physiological nutrient supply and metabolite disposal. Therefore, we investigated the influence of different scaffold configurations and cultivation methods on human osteoblasts. Cells were seeded on three-dimensional porous Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds manufactured with selective laser melting (SLM) or electron beam melting (EBM) varying in porosity, pore size and basic structure (cubic, diagonal, pyramidal) and cultured under static and dynamic conditions. Cell viability, migration and matrix production were examined via mitochondrial activity assay, fluorescence staining and ELISA. All scaffolds showed an increasing cell activity and matrix production under static conditions over time. Expectations about the dynamic culture were only partially fulfilled, since it enabled proliferation alike the static one and enhanced cell migration. Overall, the SLM manufactured scaffold with the highest porosity, small pore size and pyramidal basic structure proved to be the most suitable structure for cell proliferation and migration.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-08-24", "authors": ["JanaMarkhoff", "JanWieding", "VolkerWeissmann", "JulianePasold", "AnikaJonitz-Heincke", "RainerBader"], "doi": "10.3390/ma8085259\n10.1098/rsta.2005.1692\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00121-6\n10.3390/ma2030790\n10.3390/ma5081336\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.032\n10.2183/pjab.86.884\n10.1073/pnas.2434367100\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.002\n10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0288\n10.1016/S0142-9612(98)00144-6\n10.1016/j.msec.2010.01.005\n10.1155/2012/245727\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.03.013\n10.1002/jor.22293\n10.3390/ma6115398\n10.3390/ma4101776\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.08.006\n10.4161/cam.4.3.11747\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.013\n10.1016/j.ijom.2012.02.020\n10.1002/jbm.b.31682\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.05.046\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00102-2\n10.1089/ten.2006.0417\n10.1155/2009/873816\n10.1089/10763270360728107\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.801\n10.4161/biom.22170\n10.3109/03008207.2010.531801\n10.1073/pnas.202296599\n10.1243/09544119JEIM751\n10.1002/jbm.a.10365\n10.1016/j.tice.2011.06.003\n10.1007/s00776-007-1147-9\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2012.06.006\n10.3892/ijmm.2011.778\n10.1002/jbm.a.31540\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.041\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.05.002\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0231\n10.1002/jbm.a.20010\n10.1002/bit.24424\n10.1002/jbm.b.33146\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0255\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0321\n10.1002/bit.22214\n10.1007/s10856-012-4725-0"}
{"title": "Streamlined, Inexpensive 3D Printing of the Brain and Skull.", "abstract": "Neuroimaging technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) collect three-dimensional data (3D) that is typically viewed on two-dimensional (2D) screens. Actual 3D models, however, allow interaction with real objects such as implantable electrode grids, potentially improving patient specific neurosurgical planning and personalized clinical education. Desktop 3D printers can now produce relatively inexpensive, good quality prints. We describe our process for reliably generating life-sized 3D brain prints from MRIs and 3D skull prints from CTs. We have integrated a standardized, primarily open-source process for 3D printing brains and skulls. We describe how to convert clinical neuroimaging Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images to stereolithography (STL) files, a common 3D object file format that can be sent to 3D printing services. We additionally share how to convert these STL files to machine instruction gcode files, for reliable in-house printing on desktop, open-source 3D printers. We have successfully printed over 19 patient brain hemispheres from 7 patients on two different open-source desktop 3D printers. Each brain hemisphere costs approximately $3-4 in consumable plastic filament as described, and the total process takes 14-17 hours, almost all of which is unsupervised (preprocessing = 4-6 hr; printing = 9-11 hr, post-processing = <30 min). Printing a matching portion of a skull costs $1-5 in consumable plastic filament and takes less than 14 hr, in total. We have developed a streamlined, cost-effective process for 3D printing brain and skull models. We surveyed healthcare providers and patients who confirmed that rapid-prototype patient specific 3D models may help interdisciplinary surgical planning and patient education.

A hollow aneurysm model with connectors for silicone tubes was fabricated by using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Support material was dissolved, and surfaces were finished by using NanoSeal.

A high level of anatomic accuracy was observed, with a mean Dice index of 93.6% \u00b1 2.4%. Obstructions were encountered in vessel segments of <1 mm.\nFused deposition modeling is a promising technique, which allows rapid and precise replication of cerebral aneurysms.

{"title": "One-step reconstruction with a 3D-printed, biomechanically evaluated custom implant after complex pelvic tumor resection.", "abstract": "Resection of a pelvic tumor is challenging because of its complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy and deep-seated location with nearby vital structures. The resection is technically demanding if a custom implant is used for reconstruction of the bone defect as the surgeon needs to ensure the resection margin is sufficiently wide and the orientation of intended resection planes must match that of the custom implant. We describe a novel workflow of performing a partial acetabular resection in a patient with pelvic chondrosarcoma and reconstruction with a custom pelvic implant in a one-step operation. A multi-planar bone resection was virtually planned. A computer-aided design implant that both matched the bone defect and biomechanically evaluated was prefabricated with 3D printing technology. The 3D-printed patient-specific instruments (PSIs) were used to reproduce the same planned resection. The histology of the tumor specimen showed a clear resection margin. The errors of the achieved resection and implant position were deviating (1-4\u2009mm) from the planned. The patient could walk unaided with a good hip function. No tumor recurrence and implant loosening were noted at 11 months after surgery. The use of this novel CT-based method for surgical planning, the engineering software for implant design and validation, together with 3D printing technology for implant and PSI fabrication makes it possible to generate a personalized, biomechanically evaluated implant for accurate reconstruction after a pelvic tumor resection in a one-step operation. Further study in a larger population is needed to assess the clinical efficacy of the workflow in complex bone tumor surgery.", "journal": "Computer aided surgery : official journal of the International Society for Computer Aided Surgery", "date": "2015-08-21", "authors": ["K CWong", "S MKumta", "N VGeel", "JDemol"], "doi": "10.3109/10929088.2015.1076039"}

The materials consist of highly branched poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)s with peptide functionalised end groups in a continuous phase of crosslinked poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). Functionalisation of the end groups of the branched polymer component with the GRGDS peptide produces a hydrogel that supports cell adhesion and proliferation. The materials provide a new synthetic functional biomaterial that has many of the features of extracellular matrix, and as such can be used to support tissue regeneration and cell culture. This class of high water content hydrogel material has important advantages over other functional hydrogels in its synthesis and does not require post-processing modifications nor are functional-monomers, which change the polymerisation process, required.

By mixing acrylated with unmodified Pluronic F127 it was possible to maintain the excellent printing properties of Pluronic and to create stable gels via UV crosslinking. By subsequent elution of the unmodified Pluronic from the crosslinked network we were able to increase the cell viability of encapsulated chondrocytes at day 14 from 62% for a pure acrylated Pluronic hydrogel to 86% for a nanostructured hydrogel. The mixed Pluronic gels also showed good printability when cells where included in the bioink.

Simulated dilation was then performed on the model using a compliant and a noncompliant balloon.\nHuman cricoid fracture occurred at 97.25 N (SD = 8.34), and the synthetic cricoid model fractured at 100.10 N (SD = 7.32). Both balloons fractured the model in every replicate experiment. Mean balloon internal pressure at fracture was 7.67 ATM (SD = 1.21) for the compliant balloon and 11.34 ATM (SD = 1.29) for the noncompliant balloon.\nThese data show that fracture of the cricoid is a valid concern in balloon dilation procedures where the balloon spans the subglottis. Furthermore, the hypothesis was rejected in that the compliant balloon system was at least as likely to fracture the cricoid model as the noncompliant.", "journal": "The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology", "date": "2015-08-11", "authors": ["Christopher MJohnson", "John THowell", "Donald JMettenburg", "Frederick ARueggeberg", "Rebecca JHowell", "Gregory NPostma", "Paul MWeinberger"], "doi": "10.1177/0003489415598999"}
{"title": "Testing of a novel pin array guide for accurate three-dimensional glenoid component positioning.", "abstract": "A substantial challenge in total shoulder replacement is accurate positioning and alignment of the glenoid component. This challenge arises from limited intraoperative exposure and complex arthritic-driven deformity. We describe a novel pin array guide and method for patient-specific guiding of the glenoid central drill hole. We also experimentally tested the hypothesis that this method would reduce errors in version and inclination compared with 2 traditional methods.\nPolymer models of glenoids were created from computed tomography scans from 9 arthritic patients. Each 3-dimensional (3D) printed scapula was shrouded to simulate the operative situation. Three different methods for central drill alignment were tested, all with the target orientation of 5\u00b0 retroversion and 0\u00b0 inclination: no assistance, assistance by preoperative 3D imaging, and assistance by the pin array guide. Version and inclination errors of the drill line were compared.\nVersion errors using the pin array guide (3\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0) were significantly lower than version errors associated with no assistance (9\u00b0 \u00b1 7\u00b0) and preoperative 3D imaging (8\u00b0 \u00b1 6\u00b0). Inclination errors were also significantly lower using the pin array guide compared with no assistance.\nThe new pin array guide substantially reduced errors in orientation of the central drill line. The guide method is patient specific but does not require rapid prototyping and instead uses adjustments to an array of pins based on automated software calculations. This method may ultimately provide a cost-effective solution enabling surgeons to obtain accurate orientation of the glenoid.", "journal": "Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery", "date": "2015-08-11", "authors": ["Gregory SLewis", "Nicole MStevens", "April DArmstrong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jse.2015.06.022"}
{"title": "Bioprinting a cardiac valve.", "abstract": "Heart valve tissue engineering could be a possible solution for the limitations of mechanical and biological prostheses, which are commonly used for heart valve replacement. In tissue engineering, cells are seeded into a 3-dimensional platform, termed the scaffold, to make the engineered tissue construct. However, mimicking the mechanical and spatial heterogeneity of a heart valve structure in a fabricated scaffold with uniform cell distribution is daunting when approached conventionally. Bioprinting is an emerging technique that can produce biological products containing matrix and cells, together or separately with morphological, structural and mechanical diversity. This advance increases the possibility of fabricating the structure of a heart valve in vitro and using it as a functional tissue construct for implantation.

We also sought to correlate measurements from the source cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image dataset and the 3D model. Complicated ventriculo-arterial relationships in patients with complex conotruncal malformations make preoperative assessment of possible repair pathways difficult. Patients were chosen with double outlet right ventricle for the complexity of intracardiac anatomy and potential for better delineation of anatomic spatial relationships. Virtual 3D models were generated from CMR 3D datasets. Measurements were made on the source CMR as well as the 3D model for the following structures: aortic diameter in orthogonal planes, VSD diameter in orthogonal planes and long axis of right ventricle. A total of six patients were identified for inclusion. The path from the ventricles to each respective outflow tract and the location of the VSD with respect to each great vessel was visualized clearly in all patients. Measurements on the virtual model showed excellent correlation with the source CMR when all measurements were included by Pearson coefficient, r\u00a0=\u00a00.99 as well as for each individual structure. Construction of virtual 3D models in patients with complex conotruncal defects from 3D CMR datasets allows for simultaneous visualization of anatomic relationships relevant for surgical repair.

The aim of this study is to develop functionalized 3D printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds and use a mussel-inspired surface coating to regulate cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). We prepared PLA 3D scaffolds coated with polydopamine (PDA). The chemical composition and surface properties of PDA/PLA were characterized by XPS. PDA/PLA modulated hADSCs' responses in several ways. Firstly, adhesion and proliferation, and cell cycle of hADSCs cultured on PDA/PLA were significantly enhanced relative to those on PLA. In addition, the collagen I secreted from cells was increased and promoted cell attachment and cell cycle progression were depended on the PDA content. In osteogenesis assay, the ALP activity and osteocalcin of hADSCs cultured on PDA/PLA were significantly higher than seen in those cultured on pure PLA scaffolds. Moreover, hADSCs cultured on PDA/PLA showed up-regulation of the ang-1 and vWF proteins associated with angiogenic differentiation.

In addition, the noise attenuation performance of single cup pure ABS earmuffs is compared with double cup pure ABS earmuffs.\nABS/nanoclay filament was fabricated using a twin screw extruder. A three dimensional (3D) printing machine and a 3D model of earcup, designed by solid work software, were applied to print single and double cup earmuffs using ABS/nanoclay composite and pure ABS filaments. Finally, using an acoustic test fixture, objective noise attenuation test was performed on three different types of earmuffs, including with and without nano material and a secondary cup. Moreover, earmuffs weight was measured as a comfort component.\nInsertion loss and calculated noise reduction rating (NRR) of single cup ABS/nanoclay earmuffs (NRR=19.4 dB) and double cup pure ABS earmuffs (NRR=18.93 dB) were improved in comparison with single cup pure ABS earmuffs (NRR=15.7 dB).

Although single cup nano and double cup earmuffs had nearly the same attenuation performance, single cup nano earmuffs were 74 gr lighter than double cup earmuffs, so with reference to comfort, single cup nano earmuffs will probably be more acceptable.\nFrom this survey it might be concluded that, even though single cup ABS/nanoclay earmuffs was lighter than double cup pure ABS earmuffs, it had approximately more attenuation performance in comparison with double cup pure ABS earmuffs. Consequently, users are probably more prone to wear light- weight single cup ABS/nanoclay earmuffs as a result of improved comfort. In short, ABS/nanoclay composite can be considered a good choice in products with the necessity of high acoustic performance and low weight.", "journal": "Global journal of health science", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["SaeidAhmadi", "ParvinNassiri", "IsmaeilGhasemi", "Mohammad RMonazzam Ep"], "doi": "10.5539/gjhs.v8n1p180"}

{"title": "Integrating biologically inspired nanomaterials and table-top stereolithography for 3D printed biomimetic osteochondral scaffolds.", "abstract": "The osteochondral interface of an arthritic joint is notoriously difficult to regenerate due to its extremely poor regenerative capacity and complex stratified architecture. Native osteochondral tissue extracellular matrix is composed of numerous nanoscale organic and inorganic constituents. Although various tissue engineering strategies exist in addressing osteochondral defects, limitations persist with regards to tissue scaffolding which exhibit biomimetic cues at the nano to micro scale. In an effort to address this, the current work focused on 3D printing biomimetic nanocomposite scaffolds for improved osteochondral tissue regeneration. For this purpose, two biologically-inspired nanomaterials have been synthesized consisting of (1) osteoconductive nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA) (primary inorganic component of bone) and (2) core-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanospheres encapsulated with chondrogenic transforming growth-factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) for sustained delivery. Then, a novel table-top stereolithography 3D printer and the nano-ink (i.e., nHA + nanosphere + hydrogel) were employed to fabricate a porous and highly interconnected osteochondral scaffold with hierarchical nano-to-micro structure and spatiotemporal bioactive factor gradients. Our results showed that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteochondral differentiation were greatly improved in the biomimetic graded 3D printed osteochondral construct in vitro. The current work served to illustrate the efficacy of the nano-ink and current 3D printing technology for efficient fabrication of a novel nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold. In addition, tissue-specific growth factors illustrated a synergistic effect leading to increased cell adhesion and directed stem cell differentiation.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["Nathan JCastro", "JosephO'Brien", "Lijie GraceZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c5nr03425f"}

This novel phantom permits detection of dose both inside and outside a moving tumor and within the substitute lung tissue material. A 3D printer generated the thorax shell composed of a chest wall, spinal column, and posterior regions of the phantom. Images of a computed tomography scan of the thorax from a patient with lung cancer provided the template for the 3D printing. The plastic phantom is segmented into two materials representing the muscle and bones, and its geometry closely matches a patient. A surrogate spherical plastic tumor controlled by a 3D linear stage simulates a lung tumor's trajectory during normal breathing. Sawdust emulates the lung tissue in terms of average and distribution in Hounsfield numbers. The sawdust also provides a forgiving medium that permits tumor motion and sandwiching of radiochromic film inside the mobile surrogate plastic tumor for dosimetry. A custom cork casing shields the film and tumor and eliminates film bending during extended scans. The phantom, lung tissue surrogate, and radiochromic film are exposed to a seven field plan based on an ECLIPSE plan for 6 MV photons from a Trilogy machine delivering 230 cGy to the isocenter. The dose collected in a sagittal plane is compared to the calculated plan. Gamma analysis finds 8.8% and 5.5% gamma failure rates for measurements of large amplitude trajectory and static measurements relative to the large amplitude plan, respectively. These particular gamma analysis results were achieved using parameters of 3% dose and 3 mm, for regions receiving doses >150 cGy. The plan assumes a stationary detection grid unlike the moving radiochromic film and tissues. This difference was experimentally observed and motivated calculated dose distributions that incorporated the phase of the tumor periodic motion. These calculations modestly improve agreement between the measured and intended doses.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["RulonMayer", "PeterLiacouras", "AndrewThomas", "MingleiKang", "LiyongLin", "Charles BSimone"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4923294"}
{"title": "3D printing of layered brain-like structures using peptide modified gellan gum substrates.", "abstract": "The brain is an enormously complex organ structured into various regions of layered tissue. Researchers have attempted to study the brain by modeling the architecture using two dimensional (2D) in\u00a0vitro cell culturing methods. While those platforms attempt to mimic the in\u00a0vivo environment, they do not truly resemble the three dimensional (3D) microstructure of neuronal tissues. Development of an accurate in\u00a0vitro model of the brain remains a significant obstacle to our understanding of the functioning of the brain at the tissue or organ level. To address these obstacles, we demonstrate a new method to bioprint 3D brain-like structures consisting of discrete layers of primary neural cells encapsulated in hydrogels. Brain-like structures were constructed using a bio-ink consisting of a novel peptide-modified biopolymer, gellan gum-RGD (RGD-GG), combined with primary cortical neurons. The ink was optimized for a modified reactive printing process and developed for use in traditional cell culturing facilities without the need for extensive bioprinting equipment. Furthermore the peptide modification of the gellan gum hydrogel was found to have a profound positive effect on primary cell proliferation and network formation. The neural cell viability combined with the support of neural network formation demonstrated the cell supportive nature of the matrix. The facile ability to form discrete cell-containing layers validates the application of this novel printing technique to form complex, layered and viable 3D cell structures. These brain-like structures offer the opportunity to reproduce more accurate 3D in\u00a0vitro microstructures with applications ranging from cell behavior studies to improving our understanding of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-08-02", "authors": ["RodrigoLozano", "LeoStevens", "Brianna CThompson", "Kerry JGilmore", "RobertGorkin", "Elise MStewart", "Marcin het Panhuis", "MarioRomero-Ortega", "Gordon GWallace"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.022"}

{"title": "Optimizing cerebrovascular surgical and endovascular procedures in children via personalized 3D printing.", "abstract": "OBJECT Despite the availability of multiplanar imaging, understanding relational 3D anatomy for complex cerebrovascular lesions can be difficult. A 3D printed model allows for instantaneous visualization of lesional anatomy from all perspectives, with the added ability to simulate operative approaches with tactile feedback. The authors report their experience with customized 3D printed models of pediatric cerebrovascular lesions as an educational and clinical tool for patients, trainees, and physicians. METHODS Via an \"in-house\" 3D print service, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) studies of pediatric patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were processed with specialized software, and regions of interest were selected by the surgical/endovascular team. Multiple models for each patient were then printed on a 3D printer, with each construct designed to illustrate different aspects of the specific lesion. Intraoperative validation of model fidelity was performed using perioperative imaging, surgical filming, and post hoc analysis of models with intraoperative photography. RESULTS Four cases involving pediatric patients (ages 0-16 years) were studied for initial proof of principle. Three of the patients had AVMs and one had a vein of Galen malformation (VOGM). The VOGM was embolized successfully and the AVMs were resected without complication. In the AVM cases, intraprocedural imaging and photography were performed and verified millimeter-level fidelity of the models (n = 5, 98% concordance, range 94%-100% with average of < 2 mm variation in the largest AVM [6-cm diameter]). The use of 3D models was associated with a 30-minute reduction in operative time (12%) in 2 cases when they were compared with matched controls as a feasibility study. CONCLUSIONS Patient-specific 3D printed models of pediatric cerebrovascular conditions can be constructed with high fidelity.

{"title": "3D-printed dimethyloxallyl glycine delivery scaffolds to improve angiogenesis and osteogenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling processes are vital in bone tissue engineering. Normal biomaterials implanted in bone defects have issues in the sufficient formation of blood vessels, especially in the central part. Single delivery of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) to foci in previous studies did not show satisfactory results due to low loading doses, a short protein half-life and low efficiency. Development of a hypoxia-mimicking microenvironment for cells by local prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor release, which can stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression, is an alternative method. The aim of this study was to design a dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) delivering scaffold composed of mesoporous bioactive glasses and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) polymers (MPHS scaffolds), so as to investigate whether the sustained release of DMOG promotes local angiogenesis and bone healing. The morphology and microstructure of composite scaffolds were characterized. The DMOG release patterns from scaffolds loaded with different DMOG dosages were evaluated, and the effects of DMOG delivery on human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) adhesion, viability, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic-relative gene expressions with scaffolds were also investigated. In vivo studies were carried out to observe vascular formations and new bone ingrowth with DMOG-loaded scaffolds. The results showed that DMOG could be released in a sustained manner over 4 weeks from MPHS scaffolds and obviously enhance the angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the defects. Microfil perfusion showed a significantly increased formation of vessels in the defects with DMOG delivery. Furthermore, micro-CT imaging and fluorescence labeling indicated larger areas of bone formation for DMOG-loaded scaffolds.

{"title": "Bone tissue regeneration: the role of scaffold geometry.", "abstract": "The geometry of porous scaffolds that are used for bone tissue engineering and/or bone substitution has recently been shown to significantly influence the cellular response and the rate of bone tissue regeneration. Most importantly, it has been shown that the rate of tissue generation increases with curvature and is much larger on concave surfaces as compared to convex and planar surfaces. In this work, recent discoveries concerning the effects of geometrical features of porous scaffolds such as surface curvature, pore shape, and pore size on the cellular response and bone tissue regeneration process are reviewed. In addition to reviewing the recent experimental observations, we discuss the mechanisms through which geometry affects the bone tissue regeneration process. Of particular interest are the theoretical models that have been developed to explain the role of geometry in the bone tissue regeneration process. We then follow with a section on the implications of the observed phenomena for geometrical design of porous scaffolds including the application of predictive computational models in geometrical design of porous scaffolds. Moreover, some geometrical concepts in the design of porous scaffolds such as minimal surfaces and porous structures with geometrical gradients that have not been explored before are suggested for future studies. We especially focus on the porous scaffolds manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques where the geometry of the porous scaffolds could be precisely controlled.

The manufacturability, microstructure and mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices were evaluated. Comparison between 3D micro-CT reconstructed models and original CAD models of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices shows excellent reproduction of the designs. The as-built Ti-6Al-4V struts exhibit the microstructure of columnar grains filled with very fine and orthogonally oriented \u03b1' martensitic laths with the width of 100-300 nm and have the microhardness of 4.01 \u00b1 0.34 GPa.

Also, the microhardness is decreased to 3.71 \u00b1 0.35 GPa due to the coarsening of the microstructure. The 80-95% porosity TPMS lattices exhibit a comparable porosity with trabecular bone, and the modulus is in the range of 0.12-1.25 GPa and thus can be adjusted to the modulus of trabecular bone. At the same range of porosity of 5-10%, the moduli of cortical bone and of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices are in a similar range. Therefore, the modulus and porosity of Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices can be tailored to the levels of human bones and thus reduce or avoid \"stress shielding\" and increase longevity of implants.

First, we prepared and characterized several tissue-derived decellularized extracellular matrix-based solutions, which contain complex combinations of growth factors, collagens, glycosaminoglycans, and elastin. These solutions can be incorporated into bioinks to provide the important biochemical cues of different tissue types.

In this study we consider the effects of tensile force on osteoclastogenesis in human monocytes. The cells were treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor\u00a0\u03baB ligand (RANKL) to promote osteoclastogenesis. Then,expression and secretion of cathepsin K were examined. RANKL and the formation of osteoclasts during the osteoclast differentiation process under continual tensile stress were evaluated by Western blot. It was also found that -100\u00a0kPa or lower induces RANKL-enhanced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, an increased tensile force raises the expression and secretion of cathepsin K elevated by RANKL, and is concurrent with the increase of TNF-receptor-associated factor\u00a06 induction and nuclear factor \u03baB activation. Overall, the current report demonstrates that tensile force reinforces RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by retarding osteoclast differentiation. The tensile force is able to modify every cell through dose-dependent in vitro RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, affecting the fusion of preosteoclasts and function of osteoclasts. However, tensile force increased TNF-receptor-associated factor\u00a06 expression. These results are in vitro findings and were obtained under a condition of tensile force.

{"title": "Impact of Particle Size of Ceramic Granule Blends on Mechanical Strength and Porosity of 3D Printed Scaffolds.", "abstract": "3D printing is a promising method for the fabrication of scaffolds in the field of bone tissue engineering. To date, the mechanical strength of 3D printed ceramic scaffolds is not sufficient for a variety of applications in the reconstructive surgery. Mechanical strength is directly in relation with the porosity of the 3D printed scaffolds. The porosity is directly influenced by particle size and particle-size distribution of the raw material. To investigate this impact, a hydroxyapatite granule blend with a wide particle size distribution was fractioned by sieving.

The goal of this study is to develop a series of novel fullerene-type bio-carriers using the three-dimensional printing (3DP) technique. 3DP can fabricate bio-carriers with more specialized structures compared with traditional fabrication processes. In this research, three types of fullerene-type bio-carriers were fabricated using the 3DP technique and then compared with bio-carrier K3 (from AnoxKaldnes) in the areas of physicochemical properties and biofilm growth. Images acquired by 3D profiling and SEM indicated that the surface roughness of the 3DP bio-carrier was greater than that of K3. Furthermore, contact angle data indicated that the 3DP bio-carriers were more hydrophilic than K3. The biofilm on the 3DP bio-carriers exhibited higher microbial activity and stronger adhesion ability. These findings were attributed to excellent mass transfer of the substrate (and oxygen) between the vapour-liquid-solid tri-phase system and to the surface characteristics.

Advances in the field of regenerative medicine and biofabrication provide the possibility to engineer functional cartilage with intricate architectures and complex shapes using patient-derived or donor cells. However, the development of a successful auricular cartilage implant still faces a number of challenges. These challenges include the generation of a functional biochemical matrix, the fabrication of a customized anatomical shape, and maintenance of that shape. Biofabrication technologies may have the potential to overcome these challenges due to their ability to reproducibly deposit multiple materials in complex geometries in a highly controllable manner. This topical review summarizes this potential of biofabrication technologies for the generation of implants for auricular reconstruction. In particular, it aims to discuss how biofabrication technologies, although still in pre-clinical phase, could overcome the challenges of generating and maintaining the desired auricular shapes.

It vastly reduces friction and allows for smooth gliding between contacting surfaces. The structure of articular cartilage matrix and cellular composition is zonal and is important for its mechanical properties. When cartilage becomes injured through trauma or disease, it has poor intrinsic healing capabilities. The spectrum of cartilage injury ranges from isolated areas of the joint to diffuse breakdown and the clinical appearance of osteoarthritis. Current clinical treatment options remain limited in their ability to restore cartilage to its normal functional state. This review focuses on the evolution of biomaterial scaffolds that have been used for functional cartilage tissue engineering. In particular, we highlight recent developments in multiscale biofabrication approaches attempting to recapitulate the complex 3D matrix of native articular cartilage tissue. Additionally, we focus on the application of these methods to engineering each zone of cartilage and engineering full-thickness osteochondral tissues for improved clinical implantation. These methods have shown the potential to control individual cell-to-scaffold interactions and drive progenitor cell differentiation into a chondrocyte lineage. The use of these bioinspired nanoengineered scaffolds hold promise for recreation of structure and function on the whole tissue level and may represent exciting new developments for future clinical applications for cartilage injury and restoration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Computer aided biomanufacturing of mechanically robust pure collagen meshes with controlled macroporosity.", "abstract": "Reconciliation of high strength and high porosity in pure collagen based structures is a major barrier in collagen's use in load-bearing applications. The current study developed a CAD/CAM based electrocompaction method to manufacture highly porous patterned scaffolds using pure collagen. Utilization of computerized scaffold design and fabrication allows the integration of mesh-scaffolds with controlled pore size, shape and spacing. Mechanical properties of fabricated collagen meshes were investigated as a function of number of patterned layers, and with different pore geometries. The tensile stiffness, tensile strength and modulus ranges from 10-50 N cm(-1), 1-6 MPa and 5-40 MPa respectively for all the scaffold groups. These results are within the range of practical usability of different tissue engineering application such as tendon, hernia, stress urinary incontinence or thoracic wall reconstruction. Moreover, 3-fold increase in the layer number resulted in more than 5-fold increases in failure load, toughness and stiffness which suggests that by changing the number of layers and shape of the structure, mechanical properties can be modulated for the aforementioned tissue engineering application. These patterned scaffolds offer a porosity ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mm in size, a range that is commensurate with pore sizes of repair meshes in the market. The connected macroporosity of the scaffolds facilitated cell-seeding such that cells populated the entire scaffold at the time of seeding. After 3 d of culture, cell nuclei became elongated. These results indicate that the patterned electrochemical deposition method in this study was able to develop mechanically robust, highly porous collagen scaffolds with controlled porosity which not only tries to solve one of the major tissue engineering problems at a fundamental level but also has a significant potential to be used in different tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-07-23", "authors": ["AnowarulIslam", "KatherineChapin", "MousaYounesi", "OzanAkkus"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/3/035005"}

The microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Biocompatibility assessment was performed through CCK-8 assay by coculturing with SMSCs at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days. According to the results, SMSCs are similar to other MSCs in their surface epitope expression, which are negative for CD45 and positive for CD44, CD90, and CD105. After incubation in lineage-specific medium, SMSCs could differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes and adipocytes. 3D printed nanocomposite scaffolds exhibited a good biocompatibility in the process of coculturing with SMSCs and had no negative effect on cell behavior.

Our method for generating printable versions of a cell or group of cells is to expand dendrite and axon diameters and then to transform the tracing into a 3D object with a neuronal surface generating algorithm like Constructive Tessellated Neuronal Geometry (CTNG). We show that 3D printed cells can be readily examined, manipulated, and compared with other neurons to gain insight into both the biology and the reconstruction process.

Conventional denture design and fabrication are challenged for its labor and experience intensity, urgently necessitating an automatic procedure. This study aims to develop a fully automatic procedure enabling shape optimization and additive manufacturing of removable partial dentures (RPD), to maximize the uniformity of contact pressure distribution on the mucosa, thereby reducing associated clinical complications. A 3D heterogeneous finite element (FE) model was constructed from CT scan, and the critical tissue of mucosa was modeled as a hyperelastic material from in vivo clinical data. A contact shape optimization algorithm was developed based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. Both initial and optimized dentures were prototyped by 3D printing technology and evaluated with in vitro tests. Through the optimization, the peak contact pressure was reduced by 70%, and the uniformity was improved by 63%. In vitro tests verified the effectiveness of this procedure, and the hydrostatic pressure induced in the mucosa is well below clinical pressure-pain thresholds (PPT), potentially lessening risk of residual ridge resorption. This proposed computational optimization and additive fabrication procedure provides a novel method for fast denture design and adjustment at low cost, with quantitative guidelines and computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) for a specific patient. The integration of digitalized modeling, computational optimization, and free-form fabrication enables more efficient clinical adaptation.

However, their use in resource-limited and field-settings is inhibited by the necessity for relatively large and expensive readout instruments. To mitigate this problem, we created a hand-held and cost-effective cellphone-based colorimetric microplate reader, which uses a 3D-printed opto-mechanical attachment to hold and illuminate a 96-well plate using a light-emitting-diode (LED) array. This LED light is transmitted through each well, and is then collected via 96 individual optical fibers. Captured images of this fiber-bundle are transmitted to our servers through a custom-designed app for processing using a machine learning algorithm, yielding diagnostic results, which are delivered to the user within \u223c1 min per 96-well plate, and are visualized using the same app. We successfully tested this mobile platform in a clinical microbiology laboratory using FDA-approved mumps IgG, measles IgG, and herpes simplex virus IgG (HSV-1 and HSV-2) ELISA tests using a total of 567 and 571 patient samples for training and blind testing, respectively, and achieved an accuracy of 99.6%, 98.6%, 99.4%, and 99.4% for mumps, measles, HSV-1, and HSV-2 tests, respectively.

This method was validated using 3D printed structures, representing intervertebral discs (IVD) at predetermined angles and heights, which were positioned between adjacent cadaveric vertebrae as a gold standard. Excellent agreement between our measurements and the gold standard was found for intervertebral angles in all anatomical planes (ICC > .997) and intervertebral distance measurements (ICC > .949). The proposed endplate-based JCS was compared with the vertebral body-based JCS proposed by the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) using the 3D printed structures placed between 3 adjacent vertebrae from a cadaver with scoliosis. The endplate-based method was found to have better agreement with angles in the sagittal plane (ICC = 0.985) compared with the vertebral body-based method (ICC = .280).

{"title": "Quantification of loading in biomechanical testing: the influence of dissection sequence.", "abstract": "Sequential dissection is a technique used to investigate loads experienced by articular tissues. When the joint of interest is tested in an unconstrained manner, its kinematics change with each tissue removal. To address this limitation, sufficiently rigid robots are used to constrain joint kinematics. While this approach can quantify loads experienced by each tissue, it does not assure similar results when removal order is changed. Specifically, structure loading is assumed to be independent of removal order if the structure behaves linearly (i.e. principle of superposition applies), but dependent on removal order when response is affected by material and/or geometry nonlinearities and/or viscoelasticiy (e.g. biological tissues). Therefore, this experiment was conducted to evaluate if structure loading created through robotic testing is dependent on the order in which connectors are removed. Six identical models were 3D printed. Each model was composed of 2 rigid bodies and 3 connecting structures with nonlinear time-dependent behavior. To these models, pure rotations were applied about a predefined static center of rotation using a parallel robot. A unique dissection sequence was used for each of the six models and the same movements applied robotically after each dissection. When comparing the moments experienced by each structure between different removal sequences, a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) was observed. These results suggest that even in an optimized environment, the sequence in which nonlinear viscoelastic structures are removed influence model loading.

{"title": "Poly(Dopamine)-Assisted Immobilization of Xu Duan on 3D Printed Poly(Lactic Acid) Scaffolds to Up-Regulate Osteogenic and Angiogenic Markers of Bone Marrow Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing is a versatile technique to generate large quantities of a wide variety of shapes and sizes of polymer. The aim of this study is to develop functionalized 3D printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds and use a mussel-inspired surface coating and Xu Duan (XD) immobilization to regulate cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). We prepared PLA scaffolds and coated with polydopamine (PDA). The chemical composition and surface properties of PLA/PDA/XD were characterized by XPS. PLA/PDA/XD controlled hBMSCs' responses in several ways. Firstly, adhesion and proliferation of hBMSCs cultured on PLA/PDA/XD were significantly enhanced relative to those on PLA. In addition, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression of cells was increased and promoted cell attachment depended on the XD content. In osteogenesis assay, the osteogenesis markers of hBMSCs cultured on PLA/PDA/XD were significantly higher than seen in those cultured on a pure PLA/PDA scaffolds. Moreover, hBMSCs cultured on PLA/PDA/XD showed up-regulation of the ang-1 and vWF proteins associated with angiogenic differentiation. Our results demonstrate that the bio-inspired coating synthetic PLA polymer can be used as a simple technique to render the surfaces of synthetic scaffolds active, thus enabling them to direct the specific responses of hBMSCs.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2015-07-14", "authors": ["Chia-HungYeh", "Yi-WenChen", "Ming-YouShie", "Hsin-YuanFang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma8074299\n10.1089/ten.teb.2014.0168\n10.1002/jbm.a.35107\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.3307\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.04.039\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.01.020\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.03.009\n10.1002/pola.10807\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.064\n10.1016/j.dental.2011.09.010\n10.3390/ma8052174\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.04.051\n10.1016/j.msec.2015.06.028\n10.1126/science.1147241\n10.1021/cr400407a\n10.1021/am503925r\n10.1002/smll.201201064\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.013\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.07.063\n10.1021/am5029236\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.01.010\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.06.025\n10.1002/jbm.a.31261\n10.1016/S0163-7258(00)00039-5\n10.1016/j.clpt.2005.03.010\n10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.025\n10.1002/ptr.2126\n10.1002/jbm.b.30294\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.09.015\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.02.023\n10.1007/s00774-013-0549-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.020\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.10.057\n10.1021/am302439g\n10.1039/c3tb21814g\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.06.030\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.05.038\n10.1111/iej.12227\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.10.019\n10.1021/am401071f\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.03.009\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.10.020\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.075\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.12.019\n10.1002/jcp.22840\n10.1021/cr8005125\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051670\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031682\n10.1242/jcs.053124"}

Tissue engineering aims to provide biomimetics recapitulating native tissues. Biocompatible thermoplastics for 3D printing can generate high-resolution structures resembling tissue extracellular matrix. Large-pore 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds were compared for cell ingrowth, viability, and tissue generation. Primary articular chondrocytes and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured on ABS and PLA scaffolds for three weeks. Both cell types proliferated well, showed high viability, and produced ample amounts of proteoglycan and collagen type II on both scaffolds. NP generated more matrix than chondrocytes; however, no difference was observed between scaffold types. Mechanical testing revealed sustained scaffold stability. This study demonstrates that chondrocytes and NP cells can proliferate on both ABS and PLA scaffolds printed with a simplistic, inexpensive desktop 3D printer. Moreover, NP cells produced more proteoglycan than chondrocytes, irrespective of thermoplastic type, indicating that cells maintain individual phenotype over the three-week culture period. Future scaffold designs covering larger pore sizes and better mimicking native tissue structure combined with more flexible or resorbable materials may provide implantable constructs with the proper structure, function, and cellularity necessary for potential cartilage and disc tissue repair in vivo.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["Derek HRosenzweig", "EricCarelli", "ThomasSteffen", "PeterJarzem", "LisbetHaglund"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms160715118\n10.1002/bip.21701\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00030-9\n10.1002/jbm.b.32863\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00232-0\n10.1007/s10856-013-5129-5\n10.1186/ar991\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.03.017\n10.1097/01.BRS.0000128264.46510.27\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.06.042\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.015\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0241\n10.1155/2012/698709\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.03.023\n10.1007/s00586-013-2767-8\n10.1002/jor.1100070502\n10.1016/j.berh.2011.11.013\n10.1016/j.spinee.2012.12.002\n10.1055/s-0033-1347299\n10.2217/imt.09.14\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.038\n10.1038/nmat1421\n10.1016/j.copbio.2013.04.012\n10.5435/JAAOS-21-05-303\n10.1016/j.ocl.2011.07.003\n10.1002/jbm.820040309\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.046\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.002\n10.1002/term.422\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.01.004\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0480\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.073\n10.1002/jbm.a.33216\n10.1002/mabi.201000352\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/024103\n10.1111/aor.12310\n10.1002/jbm.a.35091\n10.1007/s10561-014-9457-6\n10.1002/jor.1100120306\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.4.110701.120309\n10.1093/rheumatology/38.2.124\n10.1016/S0021-9290(97)00069-9\n10.1097/01.brs.0000192236.92867.15\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.024\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.032\n10.1186/ar4449\n10.1371/journal.pone.0101233"}
{"title": "Imaging Endogenous Bilirubins with Two-Photon Fluorescence of Bilirubin Dimers.", "abstract": "On the basis of an infrared femtosecond Cr:forsterite laser, we developed a semiquantitative method to analyze the microscopic distribution of bilirubins. Using 1230 nm femtosecond pulses, we selectively excited the two-photon red fluorescence of bilirubin dimers around 660 nm. Autofluorescences from other endogenous fluorophores were greatly suppressed. Using this distinct fluorescence measure, we found that poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues on average showed 3.7 times lower concentration of bilirubins than the corresponding nontumor parts. The corresponding fluorescence lifetime measurements indicated that HCC tissues exhibited a longer lifetime (500 ps) than that of nontumor parts (300 ps). Similarly, oral cancer cell lines had longer lifetimes (>330 ps) than those of nontumor ones (250 ps).

{"title": "Failure mechanisms of additively manufactured porous biomaterials: Effects of porosity and type of unit cell.", "abstract": "Since the advent of additive manufacturing techniques, regular porous biomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for tissue engineering scaffolds owing to their controllable pore architecture and feasibility in producing scaffolds from a variety of biomaterials. The architecture of scaffolds could be designed to achieve similar mechanical properties as in the host bone tissue, thereby avoiding issues such as stress shielding in bone replacement procedure. In this paper, the deformation and failure mechanisms of porous titanium (Ti6Al4V) biomaterials manufactured by selective laser melting from two different types of repeating unit cells, namely cubic and diamond lattice structures, with four different porosities are studied. The mechanical behavior of the above-mentioned porous biomaterials was studied using finite element models. The computational results were compared with the experimental findings from a previous study of ours. The Johnson-Cook plasticity and damage model was implemented in the finite element models to simulate the failure of the additively manufactured scaffolds under compression. The computationally predicted stress-strain curves were compared with the experimental ones. The computational models incorporating the Johnson-Cook damage model could predict the plateau stress and maximum stress at the first peak with less than 18% error. Moreover, the computationally predicted deformation modes were in good agreement with the results of scaling law analysis. A layer-by-layer failure mechanism was found for the stretch-dominated structures, i.e. structures made from the cubic unit cell, while the failure of the bending-dominated structures, i.e. structures made from the diamond unit cells, was accompanied by the shearing bands of 45\u00b0.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-07-06", "authors": ["JKadkhodapour", "HMontazerian", "A ChDarabi", "A PAnaraki", "S MAhmadi", "A AZadpoor", "SSchmauder"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.06.012"}

We embarked in a pilot study to assess the value of patient-specific 3-D physical manufacturing of spleno-pancreatic anatomy in helping during patient's counseling and for preoperative planning.\nTwelve patients scheduled for a laparoscopic splenectomy underwent contrast CT and subsequent post-processing to create virtual 3-D models of the target anatomy, and 3-D printing of the relative solid objects. The printing process, its cost and encountered problems were monitored and recorded. Patients were asked to rate the value of 3-D objects on a 1-5 scale in facilitating their understanding of the proposed procedure. Also 10 surgical residents were required to evaluate the perceived extra value of 3-D printing in the preoperative planning process.\nThe post-processing analysis required an average of 2; 20\u00a0h was needed to physically print each model and 4 additional hours to finalize each object. The cost for the material employed for each object was around 300 euros. Ten patients gave a score of 5, two a score of 4. Six residents gave a score of 5, four a score of 4.\nThree-dimensional printing is helpful in understanding complex anatomy for educational purposes at all levels.

{"title": "Emerging Applications of Bedside 3D Printing in Plastic Surgery.", "abstract": "Modern imaging techniques are an essential component of preoperative planning in plastic and reconstructive surgery. However, conventional modalities, including three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, are limited by their representation on 2D workstations. 3D printing, also known as rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing, was once the province of industry to fabricate models from a computer-aided design (CAD) in a layer-by-layer manner. The early adopters in clinical practice have embraced the medical imaging-guided 3D-printed biomodels for their ability to provide tactile feedback and a superior appreciation of visuospatial relationship between anatomical structures. With increasing accessibility, investigators are able to convert standard imaging data into a CAD file using various 3D reconstruction softwares and ultimately fabricate 3D models using 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography, multijet modeling, selective laser sintering, binder jet technique, and fused deposition modeling. However, many clinicians have questioned whether the cost-to-benefit ratio justifies its ongoing use. The cost and size of 3D printers have rapidly decreased over the past decade in parallel with the expiration of key 3D printing patents. Significant improvements in clinical imaging and user-friendly 3D software have permitted computer-aided 3D modeling of anatomical structures and implants without outsourcing in many cases. These developments offer immense potential for the application of 3D printing at the bedside for a variety of clinical applications. In this review, existing uses of 3D printing in plastic surgery practice spanning the spectrum from templates for facial transplantation surgery through to the formation of bespoke craniofacial implants to optimize post-operative esthetics are described. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of 3D printing to become an essential office-based tool in plastic surgery to assist in preoperative planning, developing intraoperative guidance tools, teaching patients and surgical trainees, and producing patient-specific prosthetics in everyday surgical practice.", "journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "date": "2015-07-03", "authors": ["Michael PChae", "Warren MRozen", "Paul GMcMenamin", "Michael WFindlay", "Robert TSpychal", "David JHunter-Smith"], "doi": "10.3389/fsurg.2015.00025\n10.1002/micr.20526\n10.1002/micr.20496\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181845994\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31826d9c5e\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31827c6e49\n10.1097/01.prs.0000436844.92623.d3\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e31820f7f90\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60206-6\n10.3727/19482413X3608676060655\n10.1080/02763869.2013.749139\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-304446\n10.1016/j.wneu.2013.07.009\n10.1016/j.ijom.2005.07.012\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31825903d1\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318255028e\n10.1097/00006534-199406000-00005\n10.1016/j.jcms.2010.07.003\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.05.023\n10.1126/science.aaa2397\n10.1007/s11548-010-0476-x\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.06.001\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.10.012\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.07.002\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000000391\n10.1109/86.559354\n10.1016/S1010-5182(99)80007-9\n10.1097/bpo.0b013e3181594ced\n10.1186/1475-925X-13-63\n10.1186/1475-925X-13-57\n10.1055/s-0034-1371080\n10.1007/s10006-014-0466-1\n10.1186/1746-160X-10-45\n10.1007/s00402-014-2075-8\n10.3941/jrcr.v6i1.889\n10.1093/ejcts/ezu310\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.04.094\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.12.030\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.09.031\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.03.055\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.12.033\n10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353332\n10.1093/icvts/ivu174\n10.5761/atcs.cr.13-00189\n10.1583/13-4450MR.1\n10.1024/0301-1526/a000148\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.03.014\n10.1016/j.urology.2014.03.042\n10.1017/S0022215110001799\n10.1080/00016480410016478\n10.1007/s00268-014-2740-7\n10.1038/nrgastro.2013.195\n10.1002/lt.23729\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2014.01.023\n10.3109/10929088.2014.887778\n10.1179/1465313313Y.0000000075\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.04.038\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.03.007\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2007.07.040\n10.1097/01.brs.0000190886.56895.3d\n10.1159/000345264\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2014.06.009\n10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.020\n10.3171/2013.11.JNS131066\n10.1016/j.wneu.2014.01.015\n10.1016/j.wneu.2013.10.032\n10.3171/jns.2004.100.1.0139\n10.1177/1553350610395031\n10.1097/SIH.0000000000000060\n10.1111/chd.12238\n10.1186/1532-429X-15-2\n10.1053/j.jvca.2013.08.015\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.03.001\n10.1007/s00266-010-9602-y\n10.1016/j.jcms.2010.01.009\n10.1007/s10047-009-0462-7\n10.1016/j.surneu.2004.01.025\n10.1054/bjps.1999.3268\n10.5312/wjo.v5.i4.412\n10.1016/j.arth.2007.09.013\n10.1056/NEJMc1206319\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.06.012\n10.1002/ase.1475\n10.1053/j.jfas.2012.01.014\n10.1016/j.prosdent.2014.04.026\n10.1016/j.joms.2013.04.010\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2014.12.003\n10.1016/j.ejps.2014.11.009\n10.1093/ejcts/ezt510\n10.1111/aor.12310\n10.1038/nbt.3056\n10.1108/01445150510626415\n10.1007/s10278-004-1014-6\n10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001\n10.1002/jmri.1139\n10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182061ebb\n10.1007/s10549-014-3028-1\n10.1002/micr.22293\n10.1016/j.jcms.2008.10.008\n10.1016/j.jcms.2008.04.003\n10.2460/ajvr.72.9.1178\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.12.016\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000000263\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000000856\n10.1111/ans.13168\n10.1097/01.prs.0000436523.79293.64\n10.1055/s-0035-1549006\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.06.002\n10.1080/10255840903251304\n10.1080/10255840903251304\n10.1016/j.cps.2011.03.007\n10.1016/j.bjps.2008.10.007\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182a014cb\n10.1111/j.1445-2197.2009.05013.x\n10.1002/micr.20684\n10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60247-3\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181cfe9bc\n10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.010\n10.1097/TA.0b013e3181ca0834\n10.3109/10929088.2011.621214\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.05.018\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.02.024\n10.1016/S1350-4533(03)00050-X\n10.1016/j.media.2008.03.007\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.01.022\n10.4172/2161-1076.S1-002\n10.3171/2013.4.SPINE121059\n10.1007/s11548-008-0275-9\n10.1227/01.NEU.0000354350.88899.07\n10.3174/ajnr.A1543\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.10.016\n10.1510/icvts.2008.194134\n10.1243/09544119JEIM83\n10.1089/end.2007.0025\n10.1097/01.prs.0000304593.74672.b8\n10.1186/1746-160X-10-14\n10.1055/s-0031-1300964\n10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60138-9\n10.1016/j.ijom.2007.07.013\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181acdb95\n10.1243/09544119JEIM856\n10.1177/0309364613512368\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109373\n10.1111/j.1532-849X.2004.04029.x\n10.1007/s12008-012-0159-7\n10.1097/00001665-200209000-00011\n10.1097/01.ID.0000127526.36938.4C"}

In this report, we describe the application of 3D printing to the design and construction of supersonic nozzles. Nozzles can be created for $0.50 or less, and the ease and low cost can facilitate the optimization of nozzle performance for the needs of any particular experiment. The efficacy of a variety of designs is assessed by examining rotational spectra of OCS (carbonyl sulfide) and Ar-OCS using a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer with tandem cavity and chirped-pulse capabilities. A slit geometry which, to the best of our knowledge has not been used in conjunction with Fourier transform microwave spectrometers, was found to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for the J = 1\u21900 transition of OCS, by a factor of three to four compared with that obtained using our standard circular nozzle. Corresponding gains for the Ar-OCS complex were marginal, at best, but further optimization of nozzle geometry should be possible. The spectrometer itself is designed to allow rapid switching between cavity and chirped-pulse modes of operation without the need to break vacuum. This feature, as well as the newly incorporated chirped-pulse capability, is described in detail.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-07-03", "authors": ["Christopher TDewberry", "Rebecca BMackenzie", "SusanGreen", "Kenneth RLeopold"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4922852"}
{"title": "Development of realistic physical breast phantoms matched to virtual breast phantoms based on human subject data.", "abstract": "Physical phantoms are essential for the development, optimization, and evaluation of x-ray breast imaging systems. Recognizing the major effect of anatomy on image quality and clinical performance, such phantoms should ideally reflect the three-dimensional structure of the human breast. Currently, there is no commercially available three-dimensional physical breast phantom that is anthropomorphic. The authors present the development of a new suite of physical breast phantoms based on human data.\nThe phantoms were designed to match the extended cardiac-torso virtual breast phantoms that were based on dedicated breast computed tomography images of human subjects. The phantoms were fabricated by high-resolution multimaterial additive manufacturing (3D printing) technology. The glandular equivalency of the photopolymer materials was measured relative to breast tissue-equivalent plastic materials. Based on the current state-of-the-art in the technology and available materials, two variations were fabricated. The first was a dual-material phantom, the Doublet. Fibroglandular tissue and skin were represented by the most radiographically dense material available; adipose tissue was represented by the least radiographically dense material. The second variation, the Singlet, was fabricated with a single material to represent fibroglandular tissue and skin. It was subsequently filled with adipose-equivalent materials including oil, beeswax, and permanent urethane-based polymer. Simulated microcalcification clusters were further included in the phantoms via crushed eggshells. The phantoms were imaged and characterized visually and quantitatively.\nThe mammographic projections and tomosynthesis reconstructed images of the fabricated phantoms yielded realistic breast background. The mammograms of the phantoms demonstrated close correlation with simulated mammographic projection images of the corresponding virtual phantoms. Furthermore, power-law descriptions of the phantom images were in general agreement with real human images. The Singlet approach offered more realistic contrast as compared to the Doublet approach, but at the expense of air bubbles and air pockets that formed during the filling process.\nThe presented physical breast phantoms and their matching virtual breast phantoms offer realistic breast anatomy, patient variability, and ease of use, making them a potential candidate for performing both system quality control testing and virtual clinical trials.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2015-07-03", "authors": ["NooshinKiarashi", "Adam CNolte", "Gregory MSturgeon", "William PSegars", "Sujata VGhate", "Loren WNolte", "EhsanSamei", "Joseph YLo"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4919771"}

These harsh conditions may prevent the incorporation of cells and therapeutic proteins in the fabrication processes. Here we developed a method for using bioprinting to produce constructs from a thermoresponsive microparticulate material based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) at ambient conditions. These constructs could be engineered with yield stresses of up to 1.22 MPa and Young's moduli of up to 57.3 MPa which are within the range of properties of human cancellous bone. Further study showed that protein-releasing microspheres could be incorporated into the bioprinted constructs. The release of the model protein lysozyme from bioprinted constructs was sustainted for a period of 15 days and a high degree of protein activity could be measured up to day 9.

However, limitations in the speed and scalability of such devices in a well-mixed setting can significantly affect their performance. In this article, we propose designs for localized circuits involving DNA molecules that are arranged on addressable substrates and interact via hybridization reactions. We propose designs for localized elementary logic circuits, which we compose to produce more complex devices, including a circuit for computing the square root of a four bit number. We develop an efficient method for probabilistic model checking of localized circuits, which we implement within the Visual DSD design tool. We use this method to prove the correctness of our circuits with respect to their functional specifications and to analyze their performance over a broad range of local rate parameters. Specifically, we analyze the extent to which our localized designs can overcome the limitations of well-mixed circuits, with respect to speed and scalability. To provide an estimate of local rate parameters, we propose a biophysical model of localized hybridization.

In this work, we present an innovative design of a high-throughput three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic chip-based device for automated immobilization and culture and time-lapse imaging of developing zebrafish embryos under continuous microperfusion. The 3D Lab-on-a-Chip array was fabricated in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) transparent thermoplastic using infrared laser micromachining, while the off-chip interfaces were fabricated using additive manufacturing processes (fused deposition modelling and stereolithography). The system's design facilitated rapid loading and immobilization of a large number of embryos in predefined clusters of traps during continuous microperfusion of drugs/toxins. It was conceptually designed to seamlessly interface with both upright and inverted fluorescent imaging systems and also to directly interface with conventional microtiter plate readers that accept 96-well plates. Compared with the conventional Petri dish assays, the chip-based bioassay was much more convenient and efficient as only small amounts of drug solutions were required for the whole perfusion system running continuously over 72 h.

This is particularly useful in maxillofacial surgery in which restoring the complex three-dimensional (3D) contour can be quite challenging. In certain situations, the best results can only be achieved with implants custom-made to fit a particular need. Significant progress has been made over the past decade in the design and manufacture of maxillofacial PSIs.\nComputer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology is rapidly advancing and has provided new options for fabrication of PSIs with better precision. Maxillofacial PSIs can now be designed using preoperative imaging data as input into CAD software. The designed implant is then fabricated using a CAM technique such as 3D printing. This approach increases precision and decreases or completely eliminates the need for intraoperative modification of implants. The use of CAD/CAM-produced PSIs for maxillofacial reconstruction and augmentation can significantly improve contour outcomes and decrease operating time.\nCAD/CAM technology allows timely and precise fabrication of maxillofacial PSIs.

{"title": "Fabrication of scalable and structured tissue engineering scaffolds using water dissolvable sacrificial 3D printed moulds.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in producing large scale engineered tissue is the lack of ability to create large highly perfused scaffolds in which cells can grow at a high cell density and viability. Here, we explore 3D printed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a sacrificial mould in a polymer casting process. The PVA mould network defines the channels and is dissolved after curing the polymer casted around it. The printing parameters determined the PVA filament density in the sacrificial structure and this density resulted in different stiffness of the corresponding elastomer replica. It was possible to achieve 80% porosity corresponding to about 150 cm(2)/cm(3) surface to volume ratio. The process is easily scalable as demonstrated by fabricating a 75 cm(3) scaffold with about 16,000 interconnected channels (about 1m(2) surface area) and with a channel to channel distance of only 78 \u03bcm. To our knowledge this is the largest scaffold ever to be produced with such small feature sizes and with so many structured channels. The fabricated scaffolds were applied for in-vitro culturing of hepatocytes over a 12-day culture period. Smaller scaffolds (6\u00d74 mm) were tested for cell culturing and could support homogeneous cell growth throughout the scaffold. Presumably, the diffusion of oxygen and nutrient throughout the channel network is rapid enough to support cell growth. In conclusion, the described process is scalable, compatible with cell culture, rapid, and inexpensive.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

Insertion of an EVD via ventriculostomy is a common neurosurgical procedure used to monitor intracranial pressures and/or drain CSF. Currently, realistic training tools are scarce and mainly limited to virtual reality simulation systems. The use of 3D printing technology enables the development of realistic anatomical structures and customized design for physical simulators. In this study, the authors used the advantages of 3D printing to directly build the model geometry from stealth head CT scans and build a phantom brain mold based on 3D scans of a plastinated human brain. The resultant simulator provides realistic haptic feedback during a procedure, with visualization of catheter trajectory and fluid drainage. A multiinstitutional survey was also used to prove content validity of the simulator.

{"title": "Fabrication and assessment of 3D printed anatomical models of the lower limb for anatomical teaching and femoral vessel access training in medicine.", "abstract": "For centuries, cadaveric dissection has been the touchstone of anatomy education. It offers a medical student intimate access to his or her first patient. In contrast to idealized artisan anatomical models, it presents the natural variation of anatomy in fine detail. However, a new teaching construct has appeared recently in which artificial cadavers are manufactured through three-dimensional (3D) printing of patient specific radiological data sets. In this article, a simple powder based printer is made more versatile to manufacture hard bones, silicone muscles and perfusable blood vessels. The approach involves blending modern approaches (3D printing) with more ancient ones (casting and lost-wax techniques). These anatomically accurate models can augment the approach to anatomy teaching from dissection to synthesis of 3D-printed parts held together with embedded rare earth magnets. Vascular simulation is possible through application of pumps and artificial blood. The resulting arteries and veins can be cannulated and imaged with Doppler ultrasound. In some respects, 3D-printed anatomy is superior to older teaching methods because the parts are cheap, scalable, they can cover the entire age span, they can be both dissected and reassembled and the data files can be printed anywhere in the world and mass produced. Anatomical diversity can be collated as a digital repository and reprinted rather than waiting for the rare variant to appear in the dissection room.

Printer accuracy was evaluated through physical measurement, and print quality was investigated by adjusting print parameters (print speed, layer thickness, percentage infill). Catheter positioning and reproducibility were measured over repeated insertions. ABS plastic water equivalency was investigated by comparing Ir-192 HDR source dose distributions, measured with radiochromic film, in ABS plastic and in water. Structures and catheter channels were printed accurately to within 0.5\u00a0mm laterally and 1\u00a0mm in the vertical print direction. Adjusting print parameters could reduce print time, albeit with reduced print quality. 3.5\u00a0mm channel diameters allowed for easy catheter insertion. Catheter positioning was reproducible to within 0.5\u00a0mm but, because of catheter flex within the channel, was on average 1\u00a0mm offset from defined TPS positions. This offset could be accounted for by repeating the treatment planning CT scan with the printed mould positioned on the patient. Dose attenuation in ABS plastic and in water was equivalent to within the measurement limitations.

The material is strong, allows for production of transparent films, provides a moist wound healing environment, and can form elastic gels with bioresponsive characteristics. In this study, we explore the application of nanocellulose as a bioink for modifying film surfaces by a bioprinting process. Two different nanocelluloses were used, prepared with TEMPO mediated oxidation and a combination of carboxymethylation and periodate oxidation. The combination of carboxymethylation and periodate oxidation produced a homogeneous material with short nanofibrils, having widths <20\u2009nm and lengths <200\u2009nm. The small dimensions of the nanofibrils reduced the viscosity of the nanocellulose, thus yielding a material with good rheological properties for use as a bioink. The nanocellulose bioink was thus used for printing 3D porous structures, which is exemplified in this study. We also demonstrated that both nanocelluloses did not support bacterial growth, which is an interesting property of these novel materials.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-06-20", "authors": ["AdamRees", "Lydia CPowell", "GaryChinga-Carrasco", "David TGethin", "KristinSyverud", "Katja EHill", "David WThomas"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/925757\n10.1021/bm060154s\n10.1021/bm061215p\n10.1021/la702481v\n10.1021/bm900414t\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.12.066\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.03.018\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.04.028\n10.1021/bm800038n\n10.1021/bm801065u\n10.1007/s11051-012-1213-x\n10.1007/s13758-012-0061-7\n10.1021/mz3003006\n10.1177/0885328214531511\n10.1007/s10570-011-9501-7\n10.1007/s10570-013-9948-9\n10.1142/S1793984412410061\n10.1016/S0928-4931(02)00010-3\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00139-4\n10.1007/s11706-013-0211-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.078\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.064\n10.1021/bm0497769\n10.1016/j.micron.2013.09.002\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.04.069\n10.1007/s10924-010-0248-2\n10.1039/b806789a\n10.1002/jps.21210\n10.1371/journal.pone.0027106\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199612)32:4<561::AID-JBM9>3.0.CO;2-P"}

{"title": "3D-Printed Atsttrin-Incorporated Alginate/Hydroxyapatite Scaffold Promotes Bone Defect Regeneration with TNF/TNFR Signaling Involvement.", "abstract": "High expression levels of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 within bone defects can decelerate and impair bone regeneration. However, there are few available bone scaffolds with anti-inflammatory function. The progranulin (PGRN)-derived engineered protein, Atsttrin, is known to exert antagonistic effects on the TNF-\u03b1 function. Hence, this study investigates whether 3D-printed Atsttrin-incorporated alginate(Alg)/hydroxyapatite(nHAp) scaffolds can facilitate bone healing through affecting the TNF/TNFR signaling. A 3D bioprinting system is used to fabricate Atsttrin-Alg/nHAp composite scaffolds, and the Atsttrin release from this scaffold is characterized, followed by evaluation of its efficacy on bone regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. The 3D-printed Atsttrin-Alg/nHAp scaffold exhibits a precisely defined structure, can sustain Atsttrin release for at least 5 days, has negligible cytotoxicity, and supports cell adhesion. Atsttrin can also attenuate the suppressive effects of TNF-\u03b1 on BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. The 3D-printed Atsttrin-Alg/nHAp scaffold significantly reduces the number of TNF-\u03b1 positive cells within wound sites, 7 days after post-calvarial defect surgery. Additionally, histological staining and X-ray scanning results also show that the 3D-printed Atsttrin-Alg/nHAp scaffold enhances the regeneration of mice calvarial bone defects. These findings thus demonstrate that the precise structure and anti-inflammatory properties of 3D-printed Atsttrin-Alg/nHAp scaffolds may promote bone defect repair.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2015-06-19", "authors": ["QuanWang", "QingqingXia", "YanWu", "XiaoleiZhang", "FeiqiuWen", "XiaowenChen", "ShufangZhang", "Boon ChinHeng", "YongHe", "Hong-WeiOuyang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500211"}
{"title": "Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning.", "abstract": "Early diagnosis or detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the normal elder control (NC) is very important. However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions.\nFirst, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects.

Unfortunately, current ASTM testing standards used to determine these properties were designed prior to the advent of bioresorbable materials for cages. Therefore, the applicability of these standards for bioresorbable materials is unknown. In this study, an image-based topology and a conventional 3D printed bioresorbable poly(\u03b5)-caprolactone (PCL) cervical cage design were tested in compression, compression-shear, and torsion, to establish their static and fatigue properties. Difficulties were in fact identified in establishing failure criteria and in particular determining compressive failure load. Given these limitations, under static loads, both designs withstood loads of over 650 N in compression, 395 N in compression-shear, and 0.25 Nm in torsion, prior to yielding. Under dynamic testing, both designs withstood 5 million (5M) cycles of compression at 125% of their respective yield forces. Geometry significantly affected both the static and fatigue properties of the cages. The measured compressive yield loads fall within the reported physiological ranges; consequently, these PCL bioresorbable cages would likely require supplemental fixation.

Out-of-plane compression tests showed a 27-fold increase in compressive stress and a 46-fold increase in compressive modulus compared to uncompacted collagen sheets.

A computed tomography (CT) scan is taken of both clavicles in patients with a unilateral displaced comminuted midshaft clavicle fracture. Both clavicles are 3D printed into a real-size clavicle model. Using the mirror imaging technique, the uninjured side clavicle is 3D printed into the opposite side model to produce a suitable replica of the fractured side clavicle pre-injury.\nThe 3D-printed fractured clavicle model allows the surgeon to observe and manipulate accurate anatomical replicas of the fractured bone to assist in fracture reduction prior to surgery. The 3D-printed uninjured clavicle model can be utilized as a template to select the anatomically precontoured locking plate which best fits the model.

It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development.

{"title": "Vascularisation in regenerative therapeutics and surgery.", "abstract": "Vascularisation is often deemed the holy grail of tissue engineering because it is one of the key preconditions that determine the in vivo viability of tissue constructs. Given that a well-developed vascular network allows greater complexity in tissue design and helps regulate tissue metabolism, it appears that the overall outcome of engineered tissue implants depends on the success of microvessel formation, maturation and patterning. Current approaches to vascularising tissue include both in vivo and ex vivo techniques, where blood vessel formation is either spontaneous or guided by physical or biochemical factors. The success of these strategies can then be monitored and evaluated for clinical benefit through numerous standard and novel strategies. Despite the impressive progress in the field of tissue engineering in recent times, there are still numerous technical, immunological, surgical and ethical challenges to overcome. Future prospects in this field are likely to depend on the adoption of a wide-ranging approach incorporating a combination of salient themes such as genetic manipulation, modular assembly and bioreactor coupling.

Today, Ti6Al4V ELI is still the most widely used material for porous implants, and none or little interest goes to pure titanium for use in orthopedic or load-bearing implants. Given the special mechanical behavior of cellular structures and the material properties inherent to the additive manufacturing of metals, the aim of this study is to investigate the properties of selective laser melted pure unalloyed titanium porous structures. Therefore, the static and dynamic compressive properties of pure titanium structures are determined and compared to previously reported results for identical structures made from Ti6Al4V ELI and tantalum. The results show that porous Ti6Al4V ELI still remains the strongest material for statically loaded applications, whereas pure titanium has a mechanical behavior similar to tantalum and is the material of choice for cyclically loaded porous implants. These findings are considered to be important for future implant developments since it announces a potential revival of the use of pure titanium for additively manufactured porous implants.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Porous niobium coatings fabricated with selective laser melting on titanium substrates: Preparation, characterization, and cell behavior.", "abstract": "Nb, an expensive and refractory element with good wear resistance and biocompatibility, is gaining more attention as a new metallic biomaterial. However, the high price of the raw material, as well as the high manufacturing costs because of Nb's strong oxygen affinity and high melting point have limited the widespread use of Nb and its compounds. To overcome these disadvantages, porous Nb coatings of various thicknesses were fabricated on Ti substrate via selective laser melting (SLM), which is a 3D printing technique that uses computer-controlled high-power laser to melt the metal. The morphology and microstructure of the porous Nb coatings, which had pores ranging from 15 to 50 \u03bcm in size, were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average hardness of the coating, which was measured with the linear intercept method, was 392\u00b137 HV. In vitro tests of the porous Nb coating which was monitored with SEM, immunofluorescence, and CCK-8 counts of cells, exhibited excellent cell morphology, attachment, and growth. The simulated body fluid test also proved the bioactivity of the Nb coating. Therefore, these new porous Nb coatings could potentially be used for enhanced early biological fixation to bone tissue.

{"title": "3D Printed Programmable Release Capsules.", "abstract": "The development of methods for achieving precise spatiotemporal control over chemical and biomolecular gradients could enable significant advances in areas such as synthetic tissue engineering, biotic-abiotic interfaces, and bionanotechnology. Living organisms guide tissue development through highly orchestrated gradients of biomolecules that direct cell growth, migration, and differentiation. While numerous methods have been developed to manipulate and implement biomolecular gradients, integrating gradients into multiplexed, three-dimensional (3D) matrices remains a critical challenge. Here we present a method to 3D print stimuli-responsive core/shell capsules for programmable release of multiplexed gradients within hydrogel matrices. These capsules are composed of an aqueous core, which can be formulated to maintain the activity of payload biomolecules, and a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA, an FDA approved polymer) shell. Importantly, the shell can be loaded with plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs), which permits selective rupturing of the capsule when irradiated with a laser wavelength specifically determined by the lengths of the nanorods. This precise control over space, time, and selectivity allows for the ability to pattern 2D and 3D multiplexed arrays of enzyme-loaded capsules along with tunable laser-triggered rupture and release of active enzymes into a hydrogel ambient. The advantages of this 3D printing-based method include (1) highly monodisperse capsules, (2) efficient encapsulation of biomolecular payloads, (3) precise spatial patterning of capsule arrays, (4) \"on the fly\" programmable reconfiguration of gradients, and (5) versatility for incorporation in hierarchical architectures.

This is achieved by translating deformation normal to the sliding plane into a tangential force in a manner that is akin to a toothbrush with inclined bristles. Friction asymmetry is attained by employing a layered material or a structure with parallel 'ribs' inclined to the direction of sliding. A theory of directionally asymmetric friction is presented, along with prototype IAMs designed, fabricated and tested. The friction anisotropy (the \u03be-coefficient) is characterised by the ratio of the friction forces for two opposite directions of sliding. It is further demonstrated that IAM can possess very high levels of friction anisotropy, with \u03be of the order of 10. Further increase in \u03be is attained by modifying the shape of the ribs to provide them with directionally dependent bending stiffness. Prototype IAMs produced by 3D printing exhibit truly giant friction asymmetry, with \u03be in excess of 20. A novel mechanical rectifier, which can convert oscillatory movement into unidirectional movement by virtue of directionally asymmetric friction, is proposed.

{"title": "Using 3D printed eggs to examine the egg-rejection behaviour of wild birds.", "abstract": "The coevolutionary relationships between brood parasites and their hosts are often studied by examining the egg rejection behaviour of host species using artificial eggs. However, the traditional methods for producing artificial eggs out of plasticine, plastic, wood, or plaster-of-Paris are laborious, imprecise, and prone to human error. As an alternative, 3D printing may reduce human error, enable more precise manipulation of egg size and shape, and provide a more accurate and replicable protocol for generating artificial stimuli than traditional methods. However, the usefulness of 3D printing technology for egg rejection research remains to be tested. Here, we applied 3D printing technology to the extensively studied egg rejection behaviour of American robins, Turdus migratorius. Eggs of the robin's brood parasites, brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, vary greatly in size and shape, but it is unknown whether host egg rejection decisions differ across this gradient of natural variation. We printed artificial eggs that encompass the natural range of shapes and sizes of cowbird eggs, painted them to resemble either robin or cowbird egg colour, and used them to artificially parasitize nests of breeding wild robins. In line with previous studies, we show that robins accept mimetically coloured and reject non-mimetically coloured artificial eggs. Although we found no evidence that subtle differences in parasitic egg size or shape affect robins' rejection decisions, 3D printing will provide an opportunity for more extensive experimentation on the potential biological or evolutionary significance of size and shape variation of foreign eggs in rejection decisions. We provide a detailed protocol for generating 3D printed eggs using either personal 3D printers or commercial printing services, and highlight additional potential future applications for this technology in the study of egg rejection.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2015-06-04", "authors": ["BranislavIgic", "ValerieNunez", "Henning UVoss", "RebeccaCroston", "ZacharyAidala", "Anal\u00eda VL\u00f3pez", "AimeeVan Tatenhove", "Mand\u00eb EHolford", "Matthew DShawkey", "Mark EHauber"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.965\n10.2307/1366903\n10.1007/s00265-005-0132-6\n10.1098/rsbl.2008.0645\n10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[419:ERIMWA]2.0.CO;2\n10.2307/2409854\n10.1007/s00265-013-1541-6\n10.1007/s00265-013-1649-8\n10.2307/4995\n10.1098/rspb.1979.0081\n10.1642/AUK-14-36.1\n10.1038/srep09060\n10.1111/eth.12359\n10.1002/sim.1047\n10.2307/1942661\n10.1098/rspb.2011.1718\n10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.007\n10.1111/eth.12361\n10.1006/anbe.2002.3009\n10.1642/AUK-14-28.1\n10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0851:DBEOBB]2.0.CO;2\n10.1034/j.1600-048X.2002.330311.x\n10.2307/2408948\n10.1007/s10682-014-9748-1\n10.1636/Hi09-35.1\n10.2307/40166816\n10.1676/06-123.1\n10.2307/4081145\n10.1525/cond.2009.090019\n10.1007/BF02071586\n10.1086/282984\n10.1007/BF00299299\n10.1186/1742-9994-11-34\n10.1111/jav.00571\n10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02010.x\n10.1098/rspb.2009.2018\n10.3161/000164510X516137\n10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x\n10.1111/ibi.12177\n10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01143.x\n10.1163/156853912X638445"}

This study aims to demonstrate the technical and cell biological feasibility of using scaffold-based tissue engineering in ACO.\nPre-existing cone-beam computed tomography scans were used for 3D printing of custom-made scaffolds (tricalcium phosphate-polyhydroxybutyrate (TCP-PHB)) according to the individual geometry of the alveolar bone in patients with clefts. The scaffolds were seeded with commercially available human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Cell survival and cell proliferation was monitored by live-dead assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and WST-1 assay. The osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs on the scaffolds was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay.\nThe custom-made scaffolds were nearly identical to the size and shape of the digital master. Approximately 91% of the subsequently applied mesenchymal stem cells could be seeded on the rails. We could demonstrate successful cell proliferation by a factor of 5-7 over the first 3 weeks. SEM showed a pore-border growth of the hMSCs on the scaffolds after 3 weeks of cell proliferation. The successful osteogenic differentiation of the scaffold-seeded cells could be demonstrated.\nThe concept of scaffold-based tissue engineering provides great potential as an alternative for the present gold standard of autologous bone grafts in ACO. The treatment causes less morbidity and is less invasive for managing young patients with cleft alveolar bone defects. Further in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the advantages of this novel treatment for ACO in the clinical setting.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2015-06-02", "authors": ["MoritzBerger", "FlorianProbst", "ChristinaSchwartz", "MatthiasCornelsen", "HermannSeitz", "MichaelEhrenfeld", "SvenOtto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2015.04.023"}

It is not known whether patient-specific, hollow, small-caliber vascular models can be manufactured with 3D printing, and used for small vessel endoluminal testing of devices. Manufacture of anatomically accurate, patient-specific, small-caliber arterial models was attempted using data from a patient's CT scan, free open-source software, and low-cost Internet 3D printing services. Prior to endovascular treatment of a patient with multiple splenic artery aneurysms, a 3D printed model was used preoperatively to test catheter equipment and practice the procedure. A second model was used intraoperatively as a reference. Full-scale plastic models were successfully produced. Testing determined the optimal puncture site for catheter positioning. A guide catheter, base catheter, and microcatheter combination selected during testing was used intraoperatively with success, and the need for repeat angiograms to optimize image orientation was minimized. A difficult and unconventional procedure was successful in treating the aneurysms while preserving splenic function. We conclude that creation of small-caliber vascular models with 3D printing is possible. Free software and low-cost printing services make creation of these models affordable and practical.

There are no clinically effective biological diagnostics or treatment strategies. The only recourse available is replacement with a prosthetic valve, but the inability of these devices to grow or respond biologically to their environments necessitates multiple resizing surgeries and life-long coagulation treatment, especially in children. Tissue engineering has a unique opportunity to impact heart valve disease by providing a living valve conduit, capable of growth and biological integration.\nThis review will cover current tissue engineering strategies in fabricating heart valves and their progress towards the clinic, including molded scaffolds using naturally derived or synthetic polymers, decellularization, electrospinning, 3D bioprinting, hybrid techniques, and in vivo engineering.\nWhereas much progress has been made to create functional living heart valves, a clinically viable product is not yet realized. The next leap in engineered living heart valves will require a deeper understanding of how the natural multi-scale structural and biological heterogeneity of the tissue ensures its efficient function.

The growing incidence of liver diseases worldwide requires increased numbers of liver transplant and leads to an ongoing shortage of donor livers. To meet the huge demand, various alternative approaches are being investigated including, hepatic cell transplantation, artificial devices and bioprinting of the organ itself. Adult hepatocytes are the preferred cell sources, but they have limited availability, are difficult to isolate, propagate poor and undergo rapid functional deterioration in vitro. There have been efforts to overcome these drawbacks; by improving culture condition for hepatocytes, providing adequate extracellular matrix, co-culturing with extra-parenchymal cells and identifying other cell sources. Differentiation of human stem cells to hepatocytes has become a major interest in the field of stem cell research and has progressed greatly.

{"title": "Fabrication of three-dimensional bioplotted hydrogel scaffolds for islets of Langerhans transplantation.", "abstract": "In clinical islet transplantation, allogeneic islets of Langerhans are transplanted into the portal vein of patients with type 1 diabetes, enabling the restoration of normoglycemia. After intra-hepatic transplantation several factors are involved in the decay in islet mass and function mainly caused by an immediate blood mediated inflammatory response, lack of vascularization, and allo- and autoimmunity. Bioengineered scaffolds can potentially provide an alternative extra-hepatic transplantation site for islets by improving nutrient diffusion and blood supply to the scaffold. This would ultimately result in enhanced islet viability and functionality compared to conventional intra portal transplantation. In this regard, the biomaterial choice, the three-dimensional (3D) shape and scaffold porosity are key parameters for an optimal construct design and, ultimately, transplantation outcome. We used 3D bioplotting for the fabrication of a 3D alginate-based porous scaffold as an extra-hepatic islet delivery system. In 3D-plotted alginate scaffolds the surface to volume ratio, and thus oxygen and nutrient transport, is increased compared to conventional bulk hydrogels. Several alginate mixtures have been tested for INS1E \u03b2-cell viability. Alginate/gelatin mixtures resulted in high plotting performances, and satisfactory handling properties. INS1E \u03b2-cells, human and mouse islets were successfully embedded in 3D-plotted constructs without affecting their morphology and viability, while preventing their aggregation. 3D plotted scaffolds could help in creating an alternative extra-hepatic transplantation site. In contrast to microcapsule embedding, in 3D plotted scaffold islets are confined in one location and blood vessels can grow into the pores of the construct, in closer contact to the embedded tissue.

In this study, MAPLE DW was implemented to study the jetting dynamics during the laser printing of representative viscoelastic alginate bioinks and evaluate the effects of operating conditions (e.g., laser fluence) and material properties (e.g., alginate concentration) on the jet formation performance. Through a time-resolved imaging approach, it is found that when the laser fluence increases or the alginate concentration decreases, the jetting behavior changes from no material transferring to well-defined jetting to well-defined jetting with an initial bulgy shape to jetting with a bulgy shape to pluming/splashing. For the desirable well-defined jetting regimes, as the laser fluence increases, the jet velocity and breakup length increase while the breakup time and primary droplet size decrease. As the alginate concentration increases, the jet velocity and breakup length decrease while the breakup time and primary droplet size increase.

A 3D bioprinting system with a Z-shape platform was used to realize layer-by-layer fabrication of cell-laden hydrogel structures. Curving, straight, stretched or fractured filaments can be formed by changes to the filament extrusion speed or the platform movement speed. To print a 3D structure, we first adjusted the concentration and flow rate of the sodium alginate and calcium chloride solution in the crosslinking process to get partially crosslinked filaments. Next, a motorized XY stages with the coaxial nozzle attached was used to control adjacent hollow filament deposition in the precise location for fusion. Then the Z stage attached with a Z-shape platform moved down sequentially to print layers of structure. And the printing process always kept the top two layers fusing and the below layers solidifying. Finally, the Z stage moved down to keep the printed structure immersed in the CaCl2 solution for complete crosslinking. The mechanical properties of the resulting fused structures were investigated. High-strength structures can be formed using higher concentrations of sodium alginate solution with smaller distance between adjacent hollow filaments. In addition, cell viability of this method was investigated, and the findings show that the viability of L929 mouse fibroblasts in the hollow constructs was higher than that in alginate structures without built-in microchannels.

{"title": "Pressure- and flow-controlled media perfusion differently modify vascular mechanics in lung decellularization.", "abstract": "Organ biofabrication is a potential future alternative for obtaining viable organs for transplantation. Achieving intact scaffolds to be recellularized is a key step in lung bioengineering. Perfusion of decellularizing media through the pulmonary artery has shown to be effective. How vascular perfusion pressure and flow vary throughout lung decellularization, which is not well known, is important for optimizing the process (minimizing time) while ensuring scaffold integrity (no barotrauma). This work was aimed at characterizing the pressure/flow relationship at the pulmonary vasculature and at how effective vascular resistance depends on pressure- and flow-controlled variables when applying different methods of media perfusion for lung decellularization. Lungs from 43 healthy mice (C57BL/6; 7-8 weeks old) were investigated. After excision and tracheal cannulation, lungs were inflated at 10 cmH2O airway pressure and subjected to conventional decellularization with a solution of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Pressure (PPA) and flow (V'PA) at the pulmonary artery were continuously measured. Decellularization media was perfused through the pulmonary artery: (a) at constant PPA=20 cmH2O or (b) at constant V'PA=0.5 and 0.2 ml/min. Effective vascular resistance was computed as Rv=PPA/V'PA. Rv (in cmH2O/(ml/min)); mean\u00b1SE) considerably varied throughout lung decellularization, particularly for pressure-controlled perfusion (from 29.1\u00b13.0 in baseline to a maximum of 664.1\u00b1164.3 (p<0.05), as compared with flow-controlled perfusion (from 49.9\u00b13.3 and 79.5\u00b15.1 in baseline to a maximum of 114.4\u00b113.9 and 211.7\u00b170.5 (p<0.05, both), for V'PA of 0.5 and 0.2 ml/min respectively. Most of the media infused to the pulmonary artery throughout decellularization circulated to the airways compartment across the alveolar-capillary membrane. This study shows that monitoring perfusion mechanics throughout decellularization provides information relevant for optimizing the process time while ensuring that vascular pressure is kept within a safety range to preserve the organ scaffold integrity.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-05-24", "authors": ["Renata Kda Palma", "NoeliaCampillo", "Juan JUriarte", "Luis V FOliveira", "DanielNavajas", "RamonFarr\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.04.024"}
{"title": "3D-printed silicate porous bioceramics using a non-sacrificial preceramic polymer binder.", "abstract": "Silicate bioceramics possess an excellent bioactivity; however, shaping them into complex geometries is still challenging. Therefore, this paper aims to present a new strategy for the shaping of a bioglass-ceramic with controlled geometry and properties starting from a glass powder combined with a preceramic polymer, i.e. a silicon resin, and reactive fillers. The powder-based three-dimensional (3D)-printing of wollastonite (CaSiO3)-based silicate bioceramic parts was demonstrated in this work. The resin plays a dual role, as it not only acts as a non-sacrificial binder for the filler powders in the printing process but it also reacts with the fillers to generate the desired bioceramic phases. The mechanical and physical properties, i.e. ball-on-three-balls test, density, porosity and morphology, were evaluated in 3D-printed discs. These samples possessed a total porosity around 64 vol% and a biaxial flexural strength around 6 MPa. The raw materials used in this work also enabled the 3D-printing of scaffolds possessing a designed multi-scale porosity, suitable bioceramic phase assemblage and a compressive strength of 1 MPa (for cylindrical scaffolds with total porosity ~80 vol%). Solubility in TRIS/HCl and in vitro assays, i.e. viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, were also performed. In vitro tests indicated good cell viability and no cytotoxicity effect on the cells.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-05-23", "authors": ["AZocca", "HElsayed", "EBernardo", "C MGomes", "M ALopez-Heredia", "CKnabe", "PColombo", "JG\u00fcnster"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025008"}
{"title": "Self-driven filter-based blood plasma separator microfluidic chip for point-of-care testing.", "abstract": "There is currently a growing need for lab-on-a-chip devices for use in clinical analysis and diagnostics, especially in the area of patient care. The first step in most blood assays is plasma extraction from whole blood. This paper presents a novel, self-driven blood plasma separation microfluidic chip, which can extract more than 0.1 \u03bcl plasma from a single droplet of undiluted fresh human blood (~5 \u03bcl). This volume of blood plasma is extracted from whole blood with high purity (more than 98%) in a reasonable time frame (3 to 5 min), and without the need for any external force. This would be the first step towards the realization of a single-use, self-blood test that does not require any external force or power source to deliver and analyze a fresh whole-blood sample, in contrast to the existing time-consuming conventional blood analysis. The prototypes are manufactured in polydimethylsiloxane that has been modified with a strong nonionic surfactant (Silwet L-77) to achieve hydrophilic behavior. The main advantage of this microfluidic chip design is the clogging delay in the filtration area, which results in an increased amount of extracted plasma (0.1 \u03bcl). Moreover, the plasma can be collected in one or more 10 \u03bcm-deep channels to facilitate the detection and readout of multiple blood assays. This high volume of extracted plasma is achieved thanks to a novel design that combines maximum pumping efficiency without disturbing the red blood cells' trajectory through the use of different hydrodynamic principles, such as a constriction effect and a symmetrical filtration mode. To demonstrate the microfluidic chip's functionality, we designed and fabricated a novel hybrid microdevice that exhibits the benefits of both microfluidics and lateral flow immunochromatographic tests. The performance of the presented hybrid microdevice is validated using rapid detection of thyroid stimulating hormone within a single droplet of whole blood.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-05-23", "authors": ["HojjatMadadi", "JasminaCasals-Terr\u00e9", "MahdiMohammadi"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025007"}

In this investigation, two experiments were carried out with a single professional high soprano subject. First, using two dimensional (2D) dynamic real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (24 fps) midsagittal and coronal vocal tract shapes were analyzed while the subject sang a scale from Bb5 (932\u2009Hz) to G6 (1568\u2009Hz). In a second experiment, volumetric vocal tract MRI data were recorded from sustained phonations (13\u2009s) for the pitches C6 (1047\u2009Hz) and G6 (1568\u2009Hz). Formant frequencies were measured in physical models created by 3D printing, and calculated from area functions obtained from the 3D vocal tract shapes. The data showed that there were only minor modifications of the vocal tract shape. These changes involved a decrease of the piriform sinus as well as small changes of tongue position. Formant frequencies did not exhibit major differences between C6 and G6 for F1 and F3, respectively. Only F2 was slightly raised for G6. For G6, however, F2 is not excited by any voice source partial.

{"title": "Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopic identification of dispersant/particle bonding mechanisms in functional inks.", "abstract": "In additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, material is deposited drop by drop, to create micron to macroscale layers. A typical inkjet ink is a colloidal dispersion containing approximately ten components including solvent, the nano to micron scale particles which will comprise the printed layer, polymeric dispersants to stabilize the particles, and polymers to tune layer strength, surface tension and viscosity. To rationally and efficiently formulate such an ink, it is crucial to know how the components interact. Specifically, which polymers bond to the particle surfaces and how are they attached? Answering this question requires an experimental procedure that discriminates between polymer adsorbed on the particles and free polymer. Further, the method must provide details about how the functional groups of the polymer interact with the particle. In this protocol, we show how to employ centrifugation to separate particles with adsorbed polymer from the rest of the ink, prepare the separated samples for spectroscopic measurement, and use Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) for accurate determination of dispersant/particle bonding mechanisms. A significant advantage of this methodology is that it provides high level mechanistic detail using only simple, commonly available laboratory equipment. This makes crucial data available to almost any formulation laboratory. The method is most useful for inks composed of metal, ceramic, and metal oxide particles in the range of 100 nm or greater. Because of the density and particle size of these inks, they are readily separable with centrifugation. Further, the spectroscopic signatures of such particles are easy to distinguish from absorbed polymer. The primary limitation of this technique is that the spectroscopy is performed ex-situ on the separated and dried particles as opposed to the particles in dispersion. However, results from attenuated total reflectance spectra of the wet separated particles provide evidence for the validity of the DRIFTS measurement.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-05-21", "authors": ["L JayDeiner", "ElahehFarjami"], "doi": "10.3791/52744"}
{"title": "Two-photon polymerization microfabrication of hydrogels: an advanced 3D printing technology for tissue engineering and drug delivery.", "abstract": "3D printing technology has attracted much attention due to its high potential in scientific and industrial applications. As an outstanding 3D printing technology, two-photon polymerization (TPP) microfabrication has been applied in the fields of micro/nanophotonics, micro-electromechanical systems, microfluidics, biomedical implants and microdevices. In particular, TPP microfabrication is very useful in tissue engineering and drug delivery due to its powerful fabrication capability for precise microstructures with high spatial resolution on both the microscopic and the nanometric scale. The design and fabrication of 3D hydrogels widely used in tissue engineering and drug delivery has been an important research area of TPP microfabrication. The resolution is a key parameter for 3D hydrogels to simulate the native 3D environment in which the cells reside and the drug is controlled to release with optimal temporal and spatial distribution in vitro and in vivo. The resolution of 3D hydrogels largely depends on the efficiency of TPP initiators.

In this paper, a novel millimeter-wave dual OAM mode antenna is cleverly designed, using which a 60\u2009GHz wireless communication link with two separate OAM channels is experimentally demonstrated. The main body of the dual OAM antenna is a traveling-wave ring resonator using two feeding ports fed by a 90\u00b0 hybrid coupler. A parabolic reflector is used to focus the beams. All the antenna components are fabricated by 3D printing technique and the electro-less copper plating surface treatment process. The performances of the antenna, such as S-parameters, near-fields, directivity, and isolation between the two OAM modes are measured. Experimental results show that this antenna can radiate two coaxially propagating OAM modes beams simultaneously. The multiplexing and de-multiplexing are easily realized in the antennas themselves.

{"title": "Fabrication of continuous electrospun filaments with potential for use as medical fibres.", "abstract": "Soft tissue injuries represent a substantial and growing social and economic burden. Medical fibres are commonly used to repair these injuries during surgery. Patient's outcomes are, however, not promising with around 40% of surgical repairs failing within the first few months after surgery due to poor tissue regeneration. The application of nanofibrous filaments and yarns as medical fibres and scaffolds has been suggested to improve soft tissue regeneration and enhance the quality of the repair. However, due to a lack of robustness and reliability of the current fabrication methods, continuous nanofibrous filaments cannot be manufactured and scaled up in industrial settings and are not currently available for clinical use. We have developed a robust and automated method that enables the manufacture of continuous electrospun filaments and which has the potential to be integrated into existing textile production lines. The technology uses a wire guide to form submicrofibres in a dense, narrow mesh which can be detached as a long and continuous thread. The thread can then be stretched and used to create multifilament yarns which can imitate the hierarchical architecture of tissues such as tendons and ligaments. Electrospun polydioxanone yarns produced by this method showed improved cellular proliferation and adhesion when compared to medical monofilament fibres in current clinical use. In vivo, the electrospun yarns showed a good safety profile with mild foreign body reaction and complete degradation within 5 months after implantation. These results suggest that this filament collection method has the potential to become a useful platform for the fabrication of future medical textiles.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-05-20", "authors": ["Pierre-AlexisMouthuy", "NasimZargar", "OsnatHakimi", "EmilieLostis", "AndrewCarr"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025006"}

In this work, we compare the dimensional accuracy of 3-D printed constructs of an L1 vertebra derived from CT data for an ex vivo cadaver T-L spine with the original vertebra. Processing of segmented structures using binary median filters and various surface extraction algorithms is evaluated for the effect on model dimensions.

Optimal lysis potentials were obtained for the two fabricated device geometries, and selective cell clearance was achieved with cell lysis efficiencies of 94 and 96%.

{"title": "Application of Additive Manufacturing in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is the process of joining materials to create objects from digital 3-dimensional (3D) model data, which is a promising technology in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The management of lost craniofacial tissues owing to congenital abnormalities, trauma, or cancer treatment poses a challenge to oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Many strategies have been proposed for the management of such defects, but autogenous bone grafts remain the gold standard for reconstructive bone surgery. Nevertheless, cell-based treatments using adipose stem cells combined with osteoconductive biomaterials or scaffolds have become a promising alternative to autogenous bone grafts. Such treatment protocols often require customized 3D scaffolds that fulfill functional and esthetic requirements, provide adequate blood supply, and meet the load-bearing requirements of the head. Currently, such customized 3D scaffolds are being manufactured using additive manufacturing technology. In this review, 2 of the current and emerging modalities for reconstruction of oral and maxillofacial bone defects are highlighted and discussed, namely human maxillary sinus floor elevation as a valid model to test bone tissue-engineering approaches enabling the application of 1-step surgical procedures and seeding of Good Manufacturing Practice-level adipose stem cells on computer-aided manufactured scaffolds to reconstruct large bone defects in a 2-step surgical procedure, in which cells are expanded ex\u00a0vivo and seeded on resorbable scaffolds before implantation. Furthermore, imaging-guided tissue-engineering technologies to predetermine the surgical location and to facilitate the manufacturing of custom-made implants that meet the specific patient's demands are discussed. The potential of tissue-engineered constructs designed for the repair of large oral and maxillofacial bone\u00a0defects in load-bearing situations in a 1-step surgical procedure combining these 2 innovative approaches is particularly emphasized.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2015-05-13", "authors": ["ElisabetFarr\u00e9-Guasch", "JanWolff", "Marco NHelder", "Engelbert A J MSchulten", "TimForouzanfar", "JennekeKlein-Nulend"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2015.04.019"}

While the copper electroplating process results in accurate models, it is relatively time consuming, uses caustic chemicals, and the models are often anatomically imprecise. Although the decreasing cost of 3D printing can potentially allow the reproduction of highly accurate models, the thermal performance of 3D printed models has not been evaluated. We compared the cost, accuracy, and performance of both copper and 3D printed lizard models and found that the performance of the models were statistically identical in both open and closed habitats. We also find that 3D models are more standard, lighter, durable, and inexpensive, than the copper electroformed models.", "journal": "Journal of thermal biology", "date": "2015-05-13", "authors": ["Charles MWatson", "Gamal RFrancis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtherbio.2015.03.004"}
{"title": "Low cost production of 3D-printed devices and electrostimulation chambers for the culture of primary neurons.", "abstract": "The analysis of primary neurons is a basic requirement for many areas of neurobiology. However, the range of commercial systems available for culturing primary neurons is functionally limiting, and the expense of these devices is a barrier to both exploratory and large-scale studies. This is especially relevant as primary neurons often require unusual geometries and specialised coatings for optimum growth. Fortunately, the recent revolution in 3D printing offers the possibility to generate customised devices, which can support neuronal growth and constrain neurons in defined paths, thereby enabling many aspects of neuronal physiology to be studied with relative ease. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the system hardware and software required to produce affordable 3D-printed culture devices, which are also compatible with live-cell imaging. In addition, we also describe how to use these devices to grow and stimulate neurons within geometrically constrained compartments and provide examples to illustrate the practical utility and potential that these protocols offer for many aspects of experimental neurobiology.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2015-05-13", "authors": ["Joanna DWardyn", "ChrisSanderson", "Laura ESwan", "MassimilianoStagi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.05.001"}
{"title": "Defect-Tolerant Bioinspired Hierarchical Composites: Simulation and Experiment.", "abstract": "Defect tolerance, the capacity of a material to maintain strength even under the presence of cracks or flaws, is one of the essential demands in the design of composite materials, as manufacturing induced defects, or those generated during operation, can lead to catastrophic failure and dramatically reduce the mechanical performance. In this paper, we combine computational modeling and advanced multimaterial 3D printing to examine the mechanics of several different classes of defect-tolerant bioinspired hierarchical composites, built from two base materials with contrasting mechanical properties (stiff and soft). We find that in contrast to the brittle base constituents of the composites, the existence of a hierarchical architecture leads to superior defect-tolerant properties. We show that composites with more hierarchical levels dramatically improve the defect tolerance of the material. We also examine the effect of adding both self-similar and dissimilar hierarchical levels to the materials architecture, and show that the geometries with multiple hierarchical levels can retain a significant portion of their fracture strength in the presence of either large edge cracklike flaws or multiple small distributed defects in the material. We compare the stress distributions in materials with different numbers of hierarchies in both simulation and experiment and find a more uniform stress distribution in the uncracked region of materials with higher hierarchy levels. These results provide micromechanical insights into the origin of the higher defect tolerance observed in simulation and experiment.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2015-05-11", "authors": ["RezaMirzaeifar", "Leon SDimas", "ZhaoQin", "Markus JBuehler"], "doi": "10.1021/ab500120f"}
{"title": "Multiscale fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds for tympanic membrane tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The tympanic membrane (TM) is a thin tissue able to efficiently collect and transmit sound vibrations across the middle ear thanks to the particular orientation of its collagen fibers, radiate on one side and circular on the opposite side. Through the combination of advanced scaffolds and autologous cells, tissue engineering (TE) could offer valuable alternatives to autografting in major TM lesions. In this study, a multiscale approach based on electrospinning (ES) and additive manufacturing (AM) was investigated to fabricate scaffolds, based on FDA approved copolymers, resembling the anatomic features and collagen fiber arrangement of the human TM. A single scale TM scaffold was manufactured using a custom-made collector designed to confer a radial macro-arrangement to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) electrospun fibers during their deposition. Dual and triple scale scaffolds were fabricated combining conventional ES with AM to produce poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate) block copolymer scaffolds with anatomic-like architecture. The processing parameters were optimized for each manufacturing method and copolymer. TM scaffolds were cultured in vitro with human mesenchymal stromal cells, which were viable, metabolically active and organized following the anisotropic character of the scaffolds. The highest viability, cell density and protein content were detected in dual and triple scale scaffolds. Our findings showed that these biomimetic micro-patterned substrates enabled cell disposal along architectural directions, thus appearing as promising substrates for developing functional TM replacements via TE.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-05-08", "authors": ["CarlosMota", "SerenaDanti", "DelfoD'Alessandro", "LuisaTrombi", "ClaudioRicci", "DarioPuppi", "DinuccioDinucci", "MarioMilazzo", "CesareStefanini", "FedericaChiellini", "LorenzoMoroni", "StefanoBerrettini"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025005"}

{"title": "Visualization of high speed liquid jet impaction on a moving surface.", "abstract": "Two apparatuses for examining liquid jet impingement on a high-speed moving surface are described: an air cannon device (for examining surface speeds between 0 and 25 m/sec) and a spinning disk device (for examining surface speeds between 15 and 100 m/sec). The air cannon linear traverse is a pneumatic energy-powered system that is designed to accelerate a metal rail surface mounted on top of a wooden projectile. A pressurized cylinder fitted with a solenoid valve rapidly releases pressurized air into the barrel, forcing the projectile down the cannon barrel. The projectile travels beneath a spray nozzle, which impinges a liquid jet onto its metal upper surface, and the projectile then hits a stopping mechanism. A camera records the jet impingement, and a pressure transducer records the spray nozzle backpressure. The spinning disk set-up consists of a steel disk that reaches speeds of 500 to 3,000 rpm via a variable frequency drive (VFD) motor. A spray system similar to that of the air cannon generates a liquid jet that impinges onto the spinning disc, and cameras placed at several optical access points record the jet impingement. Video recordings of jet impingement processes are recorded and examined to determine whether the outcome of impingement is splash, splatter, or deposition. The apparatuses are the first that involve the high speed impingement of low-Reynolds-number liquid jets on high speed moving surfaces. In addition to its rail industry applications, the described technique may be used for technical and industrial purposes such as steelmaking and may be relevant to high-speed 3D printing.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-05-06", "authors": ["YuchenGuo", "SheldonGreen"], "doi": "10.3791/52603"}
{"title": "A review on powder-based additive manufacturing for tissue engineering: selective laser sintering and inkjet 3D printing.", "abstract": "Since most starting materials for tissue engineering are in powder form, using powder-based additive manufacturing methods is attractive and practical. The principal point of employing additive manufacturing (AM) systems is to fabricate parts with arbitrary geometrical complexity with relatively minimal tooling cost and time. Selective laser sintering (SLS) and inkjet 3D printing (3DP) are two powerful and versatile AM techniques which are applicable to powder-based material systems. Hence, the latest state of knowledge available on the use of AM powder-based techniques in tissue engineering and their effect on mechanical and biological properties of fabricated tissues and scaffolds must be updated. Determining the effective setup of parameters, developing improved biocompatible/bioactive materials, and improving the mechanical/biological properties of laser sintered and 3D printed tissues are the three main concerns which have been investigated in this article.", "journal": "Science and technology of advanced materials", "date": "2015-05-05", "authors": ["Seyed Farid SeyedShirazi", "SamiraGharehkhani", "MehdiMehrali", "HoomanYarmand", "Hendrik Simon CornelisMetselaar", "NahrizulAdib Kadri", "Noor Azuan AbuOsman"], "doi": "10.1088/1468-6996/16/3/033502\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.05.005\n10.1016/S0890-6955(97)00137-5\n10.1002/mame.200800121\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.050\n10.1023/A:1008956126775\n10.1002/jbm.b.31577\n10.1108/13552541211250382\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.03.026\n10.1088/0957-4484/18/34/345202\n10.1016/j.jcms.2008.04.003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.002\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.05.011\n10.1007/s00170-012-4605-2\n10.1108/RPJ-03-2013-0037\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2012.04.001\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2009.05.008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.06.024\n10.1108/13552541211193467\n10.1108/RPJ-04-2012-0035\n10.1016/j.msea.2007.12.008\n10.1038/srep05599\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00131-5\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.11.057\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2011.04.001\n10.1007/s00170-012-4118-z\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.05.065\n10.1557/jmr.2014.194\n10.1080/10407782.2014.923231\n10.1016/j.msea.2005.05.017\n10.1007/BF02735019\n10.1108/13552540510623594\n10.1108/13552549810222939\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.05.019\n10.1002/app.1990.070411129\n10.1016/j.cirp.2007.10.004\n10.1016/j.cirp.2007.05.097\n10.1108/13552540210441148\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.08.047\n10.1007/s10853-009-3770-7\n10.1166/jnn.2014.9055\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.12.033\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.08.085\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.02.020\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2013.03.014\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.12.130\n10.1016/j.biopha.2008.07.051\n10.1111/ijac.12337\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.12.013\n10.1002/jbm.a.35074\n10.1142/S0219519414500493\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00131-5\n10.1016/j.actbio.2006.07.008\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.07.023\n10.1016/j.phpro.2010.08.081\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.07.005\n10.1038/srep04712\n10.1007/s002230001134\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.06.002\n10.1002/1097-4636(20010615)55:4<603::AID-JBM1054>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.01.187\n10.1016/j.dental.2014.02.008\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.10.015\n10.1111/ijac.12151\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.08.018\n10.1016/j.msec.2012.06.011\n10.1023/B:JMSM.0000046393.81449.a5\n10.3390/ijms15045426\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.01.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.030\n10.1016/j.matchar.2012.12.009\n10.1007/s12257-012-0508-1\n10.1177/0883911514522570\n10.1016/j.matchar.2014.08.017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0106802\n10.1039/b715313a\n10.1557/mrs.2011.270\n10.1108/13552541011083371\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.07.022\n10.1002/jbm.a.32298\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.04.029\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015004\n10.1080/17452759.2011.559742\n10.1108/13552540310455656\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.018\n10.1002/adhm.201400424\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.09.024\n10.1080/10426914.2014.921712\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/5/055022\n10.1108/13552540410512480\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.03.223\n10.1007/s10047-009-0462-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108252\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1108/13552540910960280\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.011\n10.1016/j.polymer.2010.03.038\n10.1021/cm0101632\n10.1002/adma.200803256\n10.1016/S1007-0214(09)70062-8\n10.1002/mawe.200600019\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015006\n10.1039/c2jm30566f\n10.1002/adem.200800179\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015001\n10.1108/13552540310477463\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.01.016\n10.1002/cite.200406161\n10.1006/jcis.2002.8527\n10.1163/156856297X00588\n10.1016/S0020-1383(00)80022-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.03.049\n10.1016/j.dental.2011.09.010\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.08.027\n10.1002/mawe.200600033\n10.1002/jbm.b.30291\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.09.039\n10.1098/rsif.2009.0379\n10.1002/pi.3006\n10.1002/jbm.b.30469\n10.1016/S0928-4931(02)00012-7\n10.1002/adma.200601370\n10.1089/107632702753503009\n10.1007/s10047-006-0347-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.064\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.01.027\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.012\n10.1002/term.555\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.01.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2007.08.010\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.11.024\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.10.024\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01206.x\n10.1007/s10856-009-3878-y\n10.1007/BF01075720\n10.1016/0006-2952(86)90245-5\n10.1002/adma.200601370\n10.1039/c3bm60132c\n10.1016/j.mattod.2013.11.017\n10.1016/j.dental.2008.03.029\n10.1007/s10103-012-1205-1"}

A filament extruder was used to obtain approx. 4% paracetamol loaded filaments of polyvinyl alcohol with characteristics suitable for use in fused-deposition modelling 3DP. Five different tablet geometries were successfully 3D-printed-cube, pyramid, cylinder, sphere and torus. The printing process did not affect the stability of the drug. Drug release from the tablets was not dependent on the surface area but instead on surface area to volume ratio, indicating the influence that geometrical shape has on drug release. An erosion-mediated process controlled drug release.

It is shoulder-controlled and externally powered with an anthropomorphic terminal device. The user can open and close all five fingers, and move the thumb independently. The estimated cost is US$300.\nAfter testing on a patient with a traumatic transradial amputation, several advantages were noted. The independent thumb movement facilitated object grasp, the device weighed less than most externally powered prostheses, and the size was easily scalable. Limitations of the new prosthetic include low grip strength and decreased durability compared to passive prosthetics.\nMost children with a transradial congenital or traumatic amputation do not use a prosthetic.

Carbon-11 is widely used in clinical PET studies due to the prevalence of facile techniques enabling the incorporation of [(11)C]CO2 and [(11)C]CH3 into molecules and a short half-life (20.4 min) that translates into low patient dose. However, the short half-life considerably limits the time for radiosynthesis. Furthermore, the majority of the syntheses of [(11)C]palmitic acid in common use employ high starting [(11)C]CO2 activities and/or expensive equipment.\n[(11)C]CO2 was trapped with greater than 99.99% efficiency by a three stage cartridge packed with molecular sieve 13X, 100-120 mesh. The labeling of n-pentadecylmagnesium bromide took place in 5 min in the cartridge, and the [(11)C]palmitic acid product was selectively eluted in ethanol following alkaline and acidic washes of the column.\nThe system reliably produced more than 925 MBq (25 mCi) of [(11)C]palmitic acid suitable for human use from 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) of [(11)C]CO2 in 8 min from end-of-bombardment.\nWe have exploited the properties of the inexpensive molecular sieve 13X to develop a miniature, disposable and leak tight \"gas capture\" system for the rapid labeling and purification of [(11)C]fatty acids in good yield and >99% radiochemical purity. The rapidity of the synthesis and purification allows small [(11)C]CO2 starting activities to be used, and with no requirement for expensive synthesis equipment or facilities, the system can be implemented in any radiopharmaceutical center.", "journal": "Nuclear medicine and biology", "date": "2015-05-03", "authors": ["AlejandroAmor-Coarasa", "James MKelly", "John WBabich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2015.03.008"}

The double compound notch type flexure stage was designed to utilize the elastic deformation of two symmetrical four-bar mechanisms to provide a millimeter-level working range. Additive manufacturing (AM) process, stereolithography, was used to fabricate the flexure stage. The AM stage was inspected by using 3D X-ray computerized tomography scanner: air-voids and shape irregularity. The compliance, open-loop resonance peak, and damping ratio of the AM stage were measured 0.317 mm/N, 80 Hz, and 0.19, respectively. The AM stage was proportional-integral-derivative positioning feedback-controlled and the capacitive type sensor was used to measure the displacement. As a result, the AM flexure mechanism was successfully 25 nm positioning controlled within 500 \u03bcm range. The resonance peak was found approximately at 280 Hz in closed-loop. This research showed that the AM flexure mechanism and the VCM can provide millimeter range with high precision and can be a good alternative to an expensive metal-based flexure mechanism and piezoelectric transducer.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2015-05-03", "authors": ["ChaBumLee", "Joshua ATarbutton"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4918982"}

METHODS Two patients underwent frontoorbital advancement surgery for unilateral coronal synostosis. Virtual surgical planning (SurgiCase-CMF, version 5.0, Materialise) was done by virtual mirroring techniques and superposition of an age-matched normative 3D pediatric skull model. Based on these measurements, surgical templates were fabricated using a 3D printer. Bifrontal craniotomy and the osteotomies for the orbital bandeau were performed based on the sterilized 3D templates. The remodeling was then done placing the bone plates within the negative 3D templates and fixing them using absorbable poly-dl-lactic acid plates and screws. RESULTS Both patients exhibited a satisfying head shape postoperatively and at follow-up. No surgery-related complications occurred. The cutting and positioning of the 3D surgical templates proved to be very accurate and easy to use as well as reproducible and efficient. CONCLUSIONS Computer-assisted virtual planning and 3D template fabrication for frontoorbital advancement surgery leads to reconstructions based on standardizedmeasurements, precludes subjective remodeling, and seems to be overall safe and feasible.

Even though traditional micro/nanofabrication technologies expedited the emergence of the microfluidics field, recent advances in advanced additive manufacturing hold significant potential for single-step, stand-alone microfluidic device fabrication. One such technology, which holds a significant promise for next generation microsystem fabrication is three-dimensional (3D) printing. Presently, building 3D printed stand-alone microfluidic devices with fully embedded microchannels for applications in biology and medicine has the following challenges: (i) limitations in achievable design complexity, (ii) need for a wider variety of transparent materials, (iii) limited z-resolution, (iv) absence of extremely smooth surface finish, and (v) limitations in precision fabrication of hollow and void sections with extremely high surface area to volume ratio. We developed a new way to fabricate stand-alone microfluidic devices with integrated manifolds and embedded microchannels by utilizing a 3D printing and laser micromachined lamination based hybrid manufacturing approach. In this new fabrication method, we exploit the minimized fabrication steps enabled by 3D printing, and reduced assembly complexities facilitated by laser micromachined lamination method. The new hybrid fabrication method enables key features for advanced microfluidic system architecture: (i) increased design complexity in 3D, (ii) improved control over microflow behavior in all three directions and in multiple layers, (iii) transverse multilayer flow and precisely integrated flow distribution, and (iv) enhanced transparency for high resolution imaging and analysis.

In modular tissue-like construction, a scaffold with an appropriate mechanical rigidity for assembling fabrication and high biocompatibility for cell survival is the key to the successful bioconstruction. In this work, a series of composite hydrogels (GH0, GH1, GH2, and GH3) based on a combination of methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) was exploited to enhance hydrogel mechanical rigidity and promote cell functional expression for osteon biofabrication. These composite hydrogels presented a lower swelling ratio, higher mechanical moduli, and better biocompatibility when compared to the pure GelMA hydrogel. Furthermore, on the basis of the composite hydrogel and photolithograph technology, we successfully constructed an osteon-like concentric double-ring structure in which the inner ring encapsulating human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) was designed to imitate blood vessel tubule while the outer ring encapsulating human osteoblast-like cells (MG63s) acts as part of bone. During the coculture period, MG63s and HUVECs exhibited not only satisfying growth status but also the enhanced genic expression of osteogenesis-related and angiogenesis-related differentiations.

However, in most countries, the number of people willing to donate their body is low. A 3D printed model could be an alternative method for morphology research, but the accuracy of the morphology of a 3D printed model has not been determined.\nForty-five computed tomography (CT) scans of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines were obtained, and 44 parameters of the cervical spine, 120 parameters of the thoracic spine, and 50 parameters of the lumbar spine were measured. The CT scan data in DICOM format were imported into Mimics software v10.01 for 3D reconstruction, and the data were saved in .STL format and imported to Cura software. After a 3D digital model was formed, it was saved in Gcode format and exported to a 3D printer for printing. After the 3D printed models were obtained, the above-referenced parameters were measured again.\nPaired t-tests were used to determine the significance, set to P<0.05, of all parameter data from the radiographic images and 3D printed models. Furthermore, 88.6% of all parameters of the cervical spine, 90% of all parameters of the thoracic spine, and 94% of all parameters of the lumbar spine had Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values >0.800.

{"title": "Analysis of the mechanical response of biomimetic materials with highly oriented microstructures through 3D printing, mechanical testing and modeling.", "abstract": "Many biomineralized organisms have evolved highly oriented nanostructures to perform specific functions. One key example is the abrasion-resistant rod-like microstructure found in the radular teeth of Chitons (Cryptochiton stelleri), a large mollusk. The teeth consist of a soft core and a hard shell that is abrasion resistant under extreme mechanical loads with which they are subjected during the scraping process. Such remarkable mechanical properties are achieved through a hierarchical arrangement of nanostructured magnetite rods surrounded with \u03b1-chitin. We present a combined biomimetic approach in which designs were analyzed with additive manufacturing, experiments, analytical and computational models to gain insights into the abrasion resistance and toughness of rod-like microstructures. Staggered configurations of hard hexagonal rods surrounded by thin weak interfacial material were printed, and mechanically characterized with a cube-corner indenter. Experimental results demonstrate a higher contact resistance and stiffness for the staggered alignments compared to randomly distributed fibrous materials. Moreover, we reveal an optimal rod aspect ratio that lead to an increase in the site-specific properties measured by indentation. Anisotropy has a significant effect (up to 50%) on the Young's modulus in directions parallel and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rods, and 30% on hardness and fracture toughness. Optical microscopy suggests that energy is dissipated in the form of median cracks when the load is parallel to the rods and lateral cracks when the load is perpendicular to the rods. Computational models suggest that inelastic deformation of the rods at early stages of indentation can vary the resistance to penetration. As such, we found that the mechanical behavior of the system is influenced by interfacial shear strain which influences the lateral load transfer and therefore the spread of damage. This new methodology can help to elucidate the evolutionary designs of biomineralized microstructures and understand the tolerance to fracture and damage of chiton radular teeth.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-04-29", "authors": ["Enrique Escobarde Obaldia", "ChanhueJeong", "Lessa KayGrunenfelder", "DavidKisailus", "PabloZavattieri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.03.026"}

A second digital impression (STL2) with the provisional retained restoration in\u00a0situ was performed in two steps: the first part of the scan captured all details of the vestibular and palatal sides of the provisional retained restoration and the adjacent teeth. The provisional retained restoration was then unscrewed, and the subgingival part of the restoration was scanned directly out of the mouth to determine its subgingival shape. STL1 and STL2 were imported into imaging software and superimposed using the \"best fit\" algorithm to achieve a new merged file (STL3) with the 3D implant position, the peri-implant mucosa, and emergence profile. The merged file was used to design the CAD/CAM customized abutment and to realize a stereolithographic model by 3D printing.\nThe STL superimposition of digital impressions of the implant position and the provisional retained restoration constitute a novel technique to obtain a single STL file with the implant position and its peri-implant mucosal architecture.\nFDT is a rapid digital approach for achieving all information of the peri-implant soft tissue and emergence profile directly from the provisional retained restoration.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2015-04-25", "authors": ["CarloMonaco", "EdoardoEvangelisti", "RobertoScotti", "GiuseppeMignani", "GiovanniZucchelli"], "doi": "10.1111/clr.12599"}

The fundamental advantages of optofluidic fabrication include high-resolution, multi-scalability, dynamic tunability, simple operation and great potential for bulk fabrication with full automation.

In this study, we used a simple device composed of a pneumatic membrane that generates a tunable vibration frequency to apply physical stimulation to fabricate a 3D, aligned collagen fibril matrix with the characteristic D-period structure of collagen in one step. Using second harmonic images, we demonstrated that the aligned, reconstituted collagen fibrils preserve the native collagen D-period structure.

In contrast to earlier RP techniques such as stereolithography, 3D printing has introduced fast, affordable office-based manufacturing. We introduce the concept of 4D printing for the first time by introducing time as the fourth dimension to 3D printing.\nThe bones of the thumb ray are 3D printed during various movements to demonstrate four-dimensional (4D) printing.

{"title": "Recent advances in 3D printing of biomaterials.", "abstract": "3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed. In this review, the major materials and technology advances within the last five years for each of the common 3D Printing technologies (Three Dimensional Printing, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and 3D Plotting/Direct-Write/Bioprinting) are described.

{"title": "Antibacterial and Odontogenesis Efficacy of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate Combined with CO2 Laser Treatment.", "abstract": "Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been successfully used in clinical applications in endodontics. Studies show that the antibacterial effects of CO2 laser irradiation are highly efficient when bacteria are embedded in biofilm because of a photothermal mechanism. The aim of this study was to confirm the effects of CO2 laser irradiation on MTA with regard to both material characterization and cell viability.\nMTA was irradiated with a dental CO2 laser using directly mounted fiber optics in the wound healing mode with a spot area of 0.25 cm(2) and then stored in an incubator at 100% relative humidity and 37\u00b0C for 1 day to set. The human dental pulp cells cultured on MTA were analyzed along with their proliferation and odontogenic differentiation behaviors.\nThe results indicate that the setting time of MTA after irradiation by the CO2 laser was significantly reduced to 118 minutes rather than the usual 143 minutes. The maximum diametral tensile strength and x-ray diffraction patterns were similar to those obtained without CO2 laser irradiation. However, the CO2 laser irradiation increased the amount of Ca and Si ions released from the MTA and regulated cell behavior. CO2 laser-irradiated MTA promoted odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs, with the increased formation of mineralized nodules on the substrate's surface. It also up-regulated the protein expression of multiple markers of odontogenic and the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein protein.\nThe current study provides new and important data about the effects of CO2 laser irradiation on MTA with regard to the decreased setting time and increased ion release. Taking cell functions into account, the Si concentration released from MTA with laser irradiation may be lower than a critical value, and this information could lead to the development of new regenerative therapies for dentin and periodontal tissue.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2015-04-13", "authors": ["Tuan-TiHsu", "Chia-HungYeh", "Chia-TzeKao", "Yi-WenChen", "Tsui-HsienHuang", "Jaw-JiYang", "Ming-YouShie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2015.02.031"}

From these, polylactic acid and MakerBot Flexible Filament replicas of each aneurysm were created by means of fused deposition modeling. The accuracy of the replicas was assessed by quantifying statistical significance in the variations of their inner dimensions relative to 3D DSA images. Feasibility for using these replicas as flow phantoms in combination with phase contrast MRI was demonstrated.\n3D printed aneurysm models were created for all 10 subjects.

Here we demonstrate a 3D printable graphene (3DG) composite consisting of majority graphene and minority polylactide-co-glycolide, a biocompatible elastomer, 3D-printed from a liquid ink. This ink can be utilized under ambient conditions via extrusion-based 3D printing to create graphene structures with features as small as 100 \u03bcm composed of as few as two layers (<300 \u03bcm thick object) or many hundreds of layers (>10 cm thick object). The resulting 3DG material is mechanically robust and flexible while retaining electrical conductivities greater than 800 S/m, an order of magnitude increase over previously reported 3D-printed carbon materials. In vitro experiments in simple growth medium, in the absence of neurogenic stimuli, reveal that 3DG supports human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion, viability, proliferation, and neurogenic differentiation with significant upregulation of glial and neuronal genes. This coincides with hMSCs adopting highly elongated morphologies with features similar to axons and presynaptic terminals. In vivo experiments indicate that 3DG has promising biocompatibility over the course of at least 30 days. Surgical tests using a human cadaver nerve model also illustrate that 3DG has exceptional handling characteristics and can be intraoperatively manipulated and applied to fine surgical procedures.

However, for orthopaedic applications, such as joint prostheses or bone substitution, the surface must also be bio-functionalized to promote bone growth. In the current work, EBM porous Ti6Al4V alloy was exposed to an alkali acid heat (AlAcH) treatment to bio-functionalize the surface of the porous structure. Various molar concentrations (3, 5, 10M) and immersion times (6, 24 h) of the alkali treatment were used to determine optimal parameters. The apatite forming ability of the samples was evaluated using simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion testing. The micro-topography and surface chemistry of AlAcH treated samples were evaluated before and after SBF testing using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The AlAcH treatment successfully modified the topographical and chemical characteristics of EBM porous titanium surface creating nano-topographical features ranging from 200-300 nm in size with a titania layer ideal for apatite formation. After 1 and 3 week immersion in SBF, there was no Ca or P present on the surface of as manufactured porous titanium while both elements were present on all AlAcH treated samples except those exposed to 3M, 6 h alkali treatment.

The ability to control the location of immune cells during or following activation would represent a powerful new technique for this field. Targeted magnetic delivery is emerging as a technique for controlling cell movement and localization. Here we show that this technique can be extended to microglia, the primary phagocytic immune cells in the central nervous system. The magnetized microglia were generated by loading the cells with iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with CpG oligonucleotides, serving as a proof of principle that nanoparticles can be used to both deliver an immunostimulatory cargo to cells and to control the movement of the cells. The nanoparticle-oligonucleotide conjugates are efficiently internalized, non-toxic, and immunostimulatory. We demonstrate that the in vitro migration of the adherent, loaded microglia can be controlled by an external magnetic field and that magnetically-induced migration is non-cytotoxic. In order to capture video of this magnetically-induced migration of loaded cells, a novel 3D-printed \"cell box\" was designed to facilitate our imaging application.

{"title": "Mechanical cloak design by direct lattice transformation.", "abstract": "Spatial coordinate transformations have helped simplifying mathematical issues and solving complex boundary-value problems in physics for decades already. More recently, material-parameter transformations have also become an intuitive and powerful engineering tool for designing inhomogeneous and anisotropic material distributions that perform wanted functions, e.g., invisibility cloaking. A necessary mathematical prerequisite for this approach to work is that the underlying equations are form invariant with respect to general coordinate transformations. Unfortunately, this condition is not fulfilled in elastic-solid mechanics for materials that can be described by ordinary elasticity tensors. Here, we introduce a different and simpler approach. We directly transform the lattice points of a 2D discrete lattice composed of a single constituent material, while keeping the properties of the elements connecting the lattice points the same. After showing that the approach works in various areas, we focus on elastic-solid mechanics. As a demanding example, we cloak a void in an effective elastic material with respect to static uniaxial compression. Corresponding numerical calculations and experiments on polymer structures made by 3D printing are presented. The cloaking quality is quantified by comparing the average relative SD of the strain vectors outside of the cloaked void with respect to the homogeneous reference lattice.

Improving the design of the prosthetic socket has been proposed as a means of reestablishing a normal thermal environment around the residual limb. In this study, a prosthetic socket was modified by incorporating a helical cooling channel within the socket wall using additive manufacturing techniques. Two sockets were modeled: a control socket, and a modified socket containing a 0.48 cm diameter cooling channel. Computer simulations and bench-top testing were used to assess the design's ability to create a greater temperature differential across the socket wall. A greater temperature drop across the socket wall suggested that the socket could provide cooling benefits to the residual limb by allowing for heat to be drawn away from the limb. The temperature difference across the socket wall was calculated for both sockets in each aspect of the study. Both socket type (p=0.002) and location on the socket (p=0.014) were statistically significant factors affecting the temperature difference between inner and outer socket walls.

{"title": "Optimization of sampling pattern and the design of Fourier ptychographic illuminator.", "abstract": "Fourier ptychography (FP) is a recently developed imaging approach that facilitates high-resolution imaging beyond the cutoff frequency of the employed optics. In the original FP approach, a periodic LED array is used for sample illumination, and therefore, the scanning pattern is a uniform grid in the Fourier space. Such a uniform sampling scheme leads to 3 major problems for FP, namely: 1) it requires a large number of raw images, 2) it introduces the raster grid artefacts in the reconstruction process, and 3) it requires a high-dynamic-range detector. Here, we investigate scanning sequences and sampling patterns to optimize the FP approach. For most biological samples, signal energy is concentrated at low-frequency region, and as such, we can perform non-uniform Fourier sampling in FP by considering the signal structure. In contrast, conventional ptychography perform uniform sampling over the entire real space. To implement the non-uniform Fourier sampling scheme in FP, we have designed and built an illuminator using LEDs mounted on a 3D-printed plastic case. The advantages of this illuminator are threefold in that: 1) it reduces the number of image acquisitions by at least 50% (68 raw images versus 137 in the original FP setup), 2) it departs from the translational symmetry of sampling to solve the raster grid artifact problem, and 3) it reduces the dynamic range of the captured images 6 fold. The results reported in this paper significantly shortened acquisition time and improved quality of FP reconstructions. It may provide new insights for developing Fourier ptychographic imaging platforms and find important applications in digital pathology.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2015-04-04", "authors": ["KaikaiGuo", "SiyuanDong", "PariksheetNanda", "GuoanZheng"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.23.006171"}

However, limb-salvage surgery for foot sarcomas including the calcaneus remains challenging.\nA 71-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of right heel persistent pain. Imaging studies revealed an osteolytic, destructive and highly metabolic lesion in the right calcaneus. Computed tomography guided core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of grade 2 chondrosarcoma. A total calcanectomy was performed, and the defect was reconstructed with a patient matched three-dimensional printed titanium calcaneal prosthesis. Intra-operatively, ligaments including the Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia were reattached. The post-operative course was uneventful, and at the 5-month clinical follow-up, the patient was fully weightbearing, with a mobile ankle without pain.\nThis case is the first to use additive manufacturing to create a prosthetic calcaneus.

{"title": "Skull Reconstruction with Custom Made Three-Dimensional Titanium Implant.", "abstract": "Source material used to fill calvarial defects includes autologous bones and synthetic alternatives. While autologous bone is preferable to synthetic material, autologous reconstruction is not always feasible due to defect size, unacceptable donor-site morbidity, and other issues. Today, advanced three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques allow for fabrication of titanium implants customized to the exact need of individual patients with calvarial defects. In this report, we present three cases of calvarial reconstructions using 3D-printed porous titanium implants.\nFrom 2013 through 2014, three calvarial defects were repaired using custommade 3D porous titanium implants. The defects were due either to traumatic subdural hematoma or to meningioma and were located in parieto-occipital, fronto-temporo-parietal, and parieto-temporal areas. The implants were prepared using individual 3D computed tomography (CT) data, Mimics software, and an electron beam melting machine. For each patient, several designs of the implant were evaluated against 3D-printed skull models. All three cases had a custom-made 3D porous titanium implant laid on the defect and rigid fixation was done with 8 mm screws.\nThe custom-made 3D implants fit each patient's skull defect precisely without any dead space. The operative site healed without any specific complications. Postoperative CTs revealed the implants to be in correct position.\nAn autologous graft is not a feasible option in the reconstruction of large calvarial defects. Ideally, synthetic materials for calvarial reconstruction should be easily applicable, durable, and strong. In these aspects, a 3D titanium implant can be an optimal source material in calvarial reconstruction.", "journal": "Archives of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["Hyung RokCho", "Tae SukRoh", "Kyu WonShim", "Yong OockKim", "Dae HyunLew", "In SikYun"], "doi": "10.7181/acfs.2015.16.1.11"}

Endogenous insulin is stored in \u03b2-cell granules along with C-peptide, a 31 amino acid peptide that is secreted from these granules in amounts equal to insulin. Exogenous co-administration of C-peptide with insulin has proven to reduce diabetes-associated complications in animals and humans. The exact mechanism of C-peptide's beneficial effects after secretion from the \u03b2-cell granules is not completely understood, thus hindering its development as an exogenously administered hormone. Monitoring tissue-to-tissue communication using a 3D-printed microfluidic device revealed that zinc and C-peptide are being delivered to erythrocytes by albumin. Upon delivery, erythrocyte-derived ATP increased by >50%, as did endothelium-derived NO, which was measured downstream in the 3D-printed device.

The early developmental origin as well as the anatomical complexity of the head and face render these tissues prone to genetic and environmental insult. The establishment of craniofacial clinics offering comprehensive care for craniofacial patients at a single site together with international research networks focused on the origins and treatment of craniofacial disorders has led to tremendous advances in our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of congenital craniofacial anomalies. However, the genetic, environmental, and developmental sources of many craniofacial disorders remain unknown. To overcome this problem and further advance craniofacial research, we must recognize current challenges in the field and establish priority areas for study. We still need (i) a deeper understanding of variation during normal development and within the context of any disorder, (ii) improved genotyping and phenotyping and understanding of the impact of epigenetics, (iii) continued development of animal models and functional analyses of genes and variants, and (iv) integration of patient derived cells and tissues together with 3D printing and quantitative assessment of surgical outcomes for improved practice.

With recent advances in three-dimensional computer-aided designs and additive manufacturing technology, various PST designs have been reported, although the template designs were not optimized. We have developed a novel PST design that reduces the contact area without sacrificing stability. It avoids susceptibility to intervening soft tissue, template geometric inaccuracy, and difficulty during template fitting.\nFourteen candidate locations on the posterior aspect of the vertebra were evaluated. Among them, locations that had high reproducibility on computed tomography (CT) images and facilitated accurate PS placement were selected for the final PST design. An additive manufacturing machine (EOSINT M270) fabricated the PSTs using commercially pure titanium powder. For the clinical study, 36 scoliosis patients and 4 patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) were treated with thoracic PSs using our newly developed PSTs. We intraoperatively and postoperatively evaluated the accuracy of the PS hole created by the PST.\nBased on the segmentation reproducibility and stability analyses, we selected seven small, round contact points for our PST: bilateral superior and inferior points on the transverse process base, bilateral inferior points on the laminar, and a superior point on the spinous process. Clinically, the success rates of PS placement using this PST design were 98.6\u00a0% (414/420) for scoliosis patients and 100\u00a0% (46/46) for OPLL patients.\nThis study provides a useful design concept for the development and introduction of patient-specific navigational templates for placing PSs.", "journal": "European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["MitsuruTakemoto", "ShunsukeFujibayashi", "EigoOta", "BungoOtsuki", "HiroakiKimura", "TakeshiSakamoto", "ToshiyukiKawai", "TohruFutami", "KiyoyukiSasaki", "TomiharuMatsushita", "TakashiNakamura", "MasashiNeo", "ShuichMatsuda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00586-015-3908-z"}

The created 2.1 \u00d7 2.1 \u00d7 0.21 mm(3) membrane constructs are tested both in vitro by growing isolated allogeneic rabbit chondrocytes (Cho) and in vivo by implanting them into rabbit organisms for one, three and six months. An ex vivo histological examination shows that certain pore geometry and the pre-growing of Cho prior to implantation significantly improves the performance of the created 3D scaffolds.

However, little information is available on the congruency between the computer-aided design parameters for die spacer thickness and the actual printout.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the die spacer thickness achieved by combining computer-aided design and 3-dimensional printing technology.\nAn ivorine maxillary central incisor was prepared for a ceramic crown. The prepared tooth was duplicated by using polyvinyl siloxane duplicating silicone, and 80 die-stone models were produced from Type IV dental stone. The dies were randomly divided into 5 groups with assigned die spacer thicknesses of 25 \u03bcm, 45 \u03bcm, 65 \u03bcm, 85 \u03bcm, and 105 \u03bcm (n=16). The printed resin copings, obtained from a printer (ProJet DP 3000; 3D Systems), were cemented onto their respective die-stone models with self-adhesive resin cement and stored at room temperature until sectioning into halves in a buccolingual direction. The internal gap was measured at 5 defined locations per side of the sectioned die. Images of the printed resin coping/die-stone model internal gap dimensions were obtained with an inverted bright field metallurgical microscope at \u00d7100 magnification. The acquired digital image was calibrated, and measurements were made using image analysis software. Mixed models (\u03b1=.05) were used to evaluate accuracy. A false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple testing. Coefficient of variation was used to determine the precision for each group and was evaluated statistically with the Wald test (\u03b1=.05).\nThe accuracy, expressed in terms of the mean differences between the prescribed die spacer thickness and the measured internal gap (standard deviation), was 50 \u03bcm (11) for the 25 \u03bcm group simulated die spacer thickness, 30 \u03bcm (10) for the 45 \u03bcm group, 15 \u03bcm (14) for the 65 \u03bcm group, 3 \u03bcm (23) for the 85 \u03bcm group, and -10 \u03bcm (32) for the 105 \u03bcm group. The precision mean of the measurements, expressed as a coefficient of variation, ranged between 14% and 33% for the 5 groups.\nFor the accuracy evaluation, statistically significant differences were found for all the groups, except the group of 85 \u03bcm.

Having previously developed a model for temporal bone surgical training using 3D printing, we sought to produce a patient-specific model for pre-operative simulation in pediatric otologic surgery. Our hypothesis was that the creation and pre-operative dissection of such a model was possible, and would demonstrate potential benefits in cases of abnormal temporal bone anatomy.\nIn the case presented, an 11-year-old boy underwent a planned canal-wall-down (CWD) tympano-mastoidectomy for recurrent cholesteatoma preceded by a pre-operative surgical simulation using 3D-printed models of the temporal bone. The models were based on the child's pre-operative clinical CT scan and printed using multiple materials to simulate both bone and soft tissue structures. To help confirm the models as accurate representations of the child's anatomy, distances between various anatomic landmarks were measured and compared to the temporal bone CT scan and the 3D model.\nThe simulation allowed the surgical team to appreciate the child's unusual temporal bone anatomy as well as any challenges that might arise in the safety of the temporal bone laboratory, prior to actual surgery in the operating room (OR). There was minimal variability, in terms of absolute distance (mm) and relative distance (%), in measurements between anatomic landmarks obtained from the patient intra-operatively, the pre-operative CT scan and the 3D-printed models.\nAccurate 3D temporal bone models can be rapidly produced based on clinical CT scans for pre-operative simulation of specific challenging otologic cases in children, potentially reducing medical errors and improving patient safety.", "journal": "International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology", "date": "2015-03-22", "authors": ["Austin SRose", "Caroline EWebster", "Ola L AHarrysson", "Eric JFormeister", "Rounak BRawal", "Claire EIseli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.03.004"}

The ability of such pores to coordinate multiphase transport, in a highly selective and subtly triggered fashion and without clogging, has inspired interest in synthetic gated pores for applications ranging from fluid processing to 3D printing and lab-on-chip systems. But although specific gating and transport behaviours have been realized by precisely tailoring pore surface chemistries and pore geometries, a single system capable of controlling complex, selective multiphase transport has remained a distant prospect, and fouling is nearly inevitable. Here we introduce a gating mechanism that uses a capillary-stabilized liquid as a reversible, reconfigurable gate that fills and seals pores in the closed state, and creates a non-fouling, liquid-lined pore in the open state. Theoretical modelling and experiments demonstrate that for each transport substance, the gating threshold-the pressure needed to open the pores-can be rationally tuned over a wide pressure range. This enables us to realize in one system differential response profiles for a variety of liquids and gases, even letting liquids flow through the pore while preventing gas from escaping. These capabilities allow us to dynamically modulate gas-liquid sorting in a microfluidic flow and to separate a three-phase air-water-oil mixture, with the liquid lining ensuring sustained antifouling behaviour. Because the liquid gating strategy enables efficient long-term operation and can be applied to a variety of pore structures and membrane materials, and to micro- as well as macroscale fluid systems, we expect it to prove useful in a wide range of applications.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2015-03-06", "authors": ["XuHou", "YuhangHu", "AlisonGrinthal", "MugheesKhan", "JoannaAizenberg"], "doi": "10.1038/nature14253"}

Biosensor was crafted from PDMS combined with technology of 3D printing and contained reservoir with volume of 50 \u03bcL linked to input (sample/detection components and washing/immunobuffer) and output (waste). For the immunolabeling of immobilized MT anti-MT antibodies conjugated to CdTe quantum dots through synthetic heptapeptide were employed. After optimization of fundamental conditions of the immunolabeling (120 min, 20\u00b0C, and 1250 rpm) we performed it on a surface of paramagnetic nanoparticles in the biosensor reservoir, with evaluation of fluorescence of quantum dots (\u03bbexc 400 nm, and \u03bbem 555 nm). The developed biosensor was applied for quantification of MT in cell lines derived from spinocellular carcinoma (cell line 122P-N) and fibroblasts (122P-F) and levels of the biomarker were found to be about 90 nM in tumor cells and 37 nM in fibroblasts. The proposed system is able to work with low volumes (< 100 \u03bcL), with low acquisition costs and high portability.", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "date": "2015-03-05", "authors": ["ZbynekHeger", "JanZitka", "NataliaCernei", "SonaKrizkova", "MarketaSztalmachova", "PavelKopel", "MichalMasarik", "PetrHodek", "OndrejZitka", "VojtechAdam", "ReneKizek"], "doi": "10.1002/elps.201400559"}

Here, we report the use of a 3-dimensional (3D) printed physical tooth model including internal root canal structures for the endodontic treatment of a challenging tooth anomaly. A 12-year-old boy was referred for endodontic treatment of tooth #8. The tooth showed class II mobility with swelling and a sinus tract in the buccal mucosa and periapical radiolucency. The tooth presented a very narrow structure between the crown and root by distal concavity and a severely dilacerated root. Moreover, a perforation site with bleeding and another ditching site were identified around the cervical area in the access cavity. A translucent physical tooth model carrying the information on internal root canal structures was built through a 3-step process: data acquisition by cone-beam computed tomographic scanning, virtual modeling by image processing, and manufacturing by 3D printing. A custom-made guide jig was then fabricated to achieve a safe and precise working path to the root canal. Endodontic procedures including access cavity preparation were performed using the physical tooth model and the guide jig. At the 7-month follow-up, the endodontically treated tooth showed complete periapical healing with no clinical signs and symptoms.

{"title": "Microfluidically supported biochip design for culture of endothelial cell layers with improved perfusion conditions.", "abstract": "Hemodynamic forces generated by the blood flow are of central importance for the function of endothelial cells (ECs), which form a biologically active cellular monolayer in blood vessels and serve as a selective barrier for macromolecular permeability. Mechanical stimulation of the endothelial monolayer induces morphological remodeling in its cytoskeleton. For in vitro studies on EC biology culture devices are desirable that simulate conditions of flow in blood vessels and allow flow-based adhesion/permeability assays under optimal perfusion conditions. With this aim we designed a biochip comprising a perfusable membrane that serves as cell culture platform multi-organ-tissue-flow (MOTiF biochip). This biochip allows an effective supply with nutrition medium, discharge of catabolic cell metabolites and defined application of shear stress to ECs under laminar flow conditions. To characterize EC layers cultured in the MOTiF biochip we investigated cell viability, expression of EC marker proteins and cell adhesion molecules of ECs dynamically cultured under low and high shear stress, and compared them with an endothelial culture in established two-dimensionally perfused flow chambers and under static conditions. We show that ECs cultured in the MOTiF biochip form a tight EC monolayer with increased cellular density, enhanced cell layer thickness, presumably as the result of a rapid and effective adaption to shear stress by remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, endothelial layers in the MOTiF biochip express higher amounts of EC marker proteins von-Willebrand-factor and PECAM-1. EC layers were highly responsive to stimulation with TNF\u03b1 as detected at the level of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression and modulation of endothelial permeability in response to TNF\u03b1/IFN\u03b3 treatment under flow conditions.

Presented in this paper is a fabrication approach in which popular fabrication methods and techniques are coupled together to develop an integrated system that aids in the fabrication of cell-laden microfluidic systems. This system aims to reduce the uses of harsh chemicals and decreases the lengthy fabrication time. Additionally, this integrated system will enable the printing of cells as the microfluidic chip is being fabricated. To demonstrate the unique capabilities of the integrated system, an advanced microfluidic chip is being fabricated and investigated.

{"title": "Biocompatibility of electrospun human albumin: a pilot study.", "abstract": "Albumin is rarely used for electrospinning because it does not form fibres in its native globular form. This paper presents a novel method for electrospinning human albumin from a solution containing pharmaceutical grade protein and 25% polyethylene oxide (PEO) used as the fibre-forming agent. After spontaneous cross-linking at body temperature, with no further chemicals added, the fibres become insoluble and the excess PEO can be washed out. Albumin deposited along the fibres retains its native characteristics, such as its non-adhesiveness to cells and its susceptibility for degradation by macrophages. To demonstrate this we evaluated the mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability of this novel product. After subcutaneous implantation in mice, albumin mats were completely resorbable within six days and elicited only a limited local inflammatory response. In vitro, the mats suppressed cell attachment and migration. As this product is inexpensive, produced from human pharmaceutical grade albumin without chemical modifications, retains its native protein properties and fulfils the specific requirements for anti-adhesive dressings, its clinical use can be expedited.

Lenke 1 AIS patients who were preparing to undergo posterior corrective surgery from a single center between January 2010 and January 2012 were included in this analysis. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In group A, 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology was used to create subject-specific spine models in the preoperative planning process. Group B underwent posterior corrective surgery as usual (by free hand without image guidance). Perioperative and postoperative clinical outcomes were compared between 2 groups, including operation time, perioperative blood loss, transfusion volume, postoperative hemoglobin (Hb), postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. Radiological outcomes were also compared, including the assessment of screw placement, postoperative Cobb angle, coronal balance, sagittal vertical axis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis. Subgroup was also performed according to the preoperative Cobb angle: mean Cobb angle <50\u00b0 and mean Cobb angle >50\u00b0. Besides, economic evaluation was also compared between 2 groups. A total of 126 patients were included in this study (group A, 50 and group B, 76). Group A had significantly shorter operation time, significantly less blood loss and transfusion volume, and higher postoperative Hb (all, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). However, no significant differences were observed in complication rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative radiological outcomes between 2 groups (all, P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in misplacement of screws in total populations (16.90% vs 18.82%, P\u200a=\u200a0.305), whereas a low misplacement rate of pedicle screws was observed in patients whose mean Cobb angle was >50\u00b0 (9.15% vs 13.03%, P\u200a=\u200a0.02).

{"title": "Application of 3D printed customized external fixator in fracture reduction.", "abstract": "Long bone fracture is common in traumatic osteopathic patients. Good reduction is beneficial for bone healing, preventing the complications such as delayed union, nonunion, malunion, but is hard to achieve. Repeated attempts during the surgery would increase the operation time, cause new damage to the fracture site and excessive exposure to radiation. Robotic and navigation techniques can help improve the reduction accuracy, however, the high cost and complexity of operation have limited their clinical application.\nWe combined 3D printing with computer-assisted reduction technique to develop a customised external fixator with the function of fracture reduction. The original CT data obtained by scanning the fracture was imported to computer for reconstructing and reducing the 3D image of the fracture, based on which the external fixator (named as Q-Fixator) was designed and then fabricated by 3D printing techniques. The fracture reduction and fixation was achieved by connecting the pins inserted in the bones with the customised Q-Fixator. Experiments were conducted on three fracture models to demonstrate the reduction results.\nGood reduction results were obtained on all three fractured bone models, with an average rotation of 1.21\u00b0(\u00b1 0.24), angulation of 1.84\u00b0(\u00b1 0.28), and lateral displacement of 2.22 mm(\u00b1 0.62).\nA novel customised external fixator for long bone fracture reduction was readily developed using 3D printing technique.

Future application of the customised external fixator can be extended to include the fixation function with stress adjustment and potentially optimise the fracture healing process.", "journal": "Injury", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["FengQiao", "DichenLi", "ZhongminJin", "YongchangGao", "TaoZhou", "JinlongHe", "LiCheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.injury.2015.01.020"}

In the present study, a metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was used to explore the biofabrication of ZnS nanocrystals from the artificial wastewater. The biogenic H2S produced via the reduction of thiosulfate precipitated the Zn(II) as sulfide extracellularly. Characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) confirmed the precipitates as ZnS nanocrystals. The biogenic ZnS nanocrystals appeared spherical in shape with an average diameter of 5 nm and mainly aggregated in the medium and cell surface of S. oneidensis MR-1. UV-vis DRS spectra showed ZnS nanoparticles appeared a strong absorption below 360 nm. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of ZnS was evaluated by the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under UV irradiation. The biogenic ZnS nanocrystals showed a high level of photodegradation efficiency to RhB coupled with a significant blue-shift of maximum adsorption peak. A detailed analysis indicated the photogenerated holes, rather than hydroxyl radicals, contributed to the photocatalytic decolorization of RhB. This approach of coupling biosynthesis of nanoparticles with heavy metal removal may offer a potential avenue for efficient bioremediation of heavy metal wastewater.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["XiangXiao", "Xiao-BoMa", "HangYuan", "Peng-ChengLiu", "Yu-BinLei", "HuiXu", "Dao-LinDu", "Jian-FanSun", "Yu-JieFeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.02.009"}
{"title": "Articulated minimally invasive surgical instrument based on compliant mechanism.", "abstract": "In minimally invasive surgery, instruments are inserted from the exterior of the patient's body into the surgical field inside the body through the minimum incision, resulting in limited visibility, accessibility, and dexterity. To address this problem, surgical instruments with articulated joints and multiple degrees of freedom have been developed. The articulations in currently available surgical instruments use mainly wire or link mechanisms. These mechanisms are generally robust and reliable, but the miniaturization of the mechanical parts required often results in problems with size, weight, durability, mechanical play, sterilization, and assembly costs.\nWe thus introduced a compliant mechanism to a laparoscopic surgical instrument with multiple degrees of freedom at the tip. To show the feasibility of the concept, we developed a prototype with two degrees of freedom articulated surgical instruments that can perform the grasping and bending movements. The developed prototype is roughly the same size of the conventional laparoscopic instrument, within the diameter of 4 mm. The elastic parts were fabricated by Ni-Ti alloy and SK-85M, rigid parts ware fabricated by stainless steel, covered by 3D- printed ABS resin. The prototype was designed using iterative finite element method analysis, and has a minimal number of mechanical parts.\nThe prototype showed hysteresis in grasping movement presumably due to the friction; however, the prototype showed promising mechanical characteristics and was fully functional in two degrees of freedom. In addition, the prototype was capable to exert over 15 N grasping that is sufficient for the general laparoscopic procedure. The evaluation tests thus positively showed the concept of the proposed mechanism.\nThe prototype showed promising characteristics in the given mechanical evaluation experiments.

Oxide semiconductors can often fulfill all the above criteria, sometimes even with better promise than their organic counterparts, except for their high process temperature requirement. The need for high annealing/curing temperatures renders oxide FETs rather incompatible to inexpensive, flexible substrates, which are commonly used for high-throughput and roll-to-roll additive manufacturing techniques, such as printing. To overcome this serious limitation, here we demonstrate an alternative approach that enables completely room-temperature processing of printed oxide FETs with device mobility as large as 12.5 cm(2)/(V s). The key aspect of the present concept is a chemically controlled curing process of the printed nanoparticle ink that provides surprisingly dense thin films and excellent interparticle electrical contacts.

In this paper, human cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (CB-hMSCs) were differentiated to skeletal muscle cells (hSkMCs) on spin coated thin GO sheets composed of GOnPs and on electrospun fibrous meshes of GO-PCL (poly-caprolactone) composite.

Significantly enhanced values of both \u03c3 and \u03f5 of the GO-PCL composite were considered to provide favourable cues for the formation of superior multinucleated myotubes on the electrospun meshes compared to those on thin GO sheets.

In order to realize suitable osteoblast carriers, methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin was introduced into 3D printed poly-\u03b5-caprolactone scaffolds created using the Bioplotter technology, followed by performing a cryogenic treatment which was concomitant with the redox-initiated, covalent crosslinking of the gelatin derivative (i.e. cryogelation). In a first part, the efficiency of the cryogelation process was determined using gel fraction experiments and by correlating the results with conventional hydrogel formation at room temperature. Next, the optimal cryogelation parameters were fed into the combinatory approach and the scaffolds developed were characterized for their structural and mechanical properties using scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography and compression tests respectively. In a final part, in vitro biocompatibility assays indicated a good colonization of the pre-osteoblasts and the attachment of viable cells onto the cryogenic network.

Recapitulating the human gut microbiome \"on chip\" holds promise to revolutionize therapeutic strategies for a variety of diseases, as well as for maintaining homeostasis in healthy individuals. A more refined understanding of bacterial-bacterial and bacterial-epithelial cell signalling is envisioned and such a device is a key enabler. Indeed, significant advances in the study of bacterial cell-cell signalling have been reported, including at length and time scales of the cells and their responses. Few reports exist, however, where signalling events that span physiologically relevant time scales are monitored and coordinated. Here, we employ principles of biofabrication to assemble, in situ, cell communities that are (i) spatially adjacent within partitioned microchannels for studying near communication and (ii) distally connected within longitudinal microfluidic networks so as to mimic long distance signalling among intestinal flora. We observed native signalling processes of the bacterial quorum sensing autoinducer-2 (AI-2) system among and between these communities. Cells in an upstream device successfully self-reported their activities and also secreted autoinducers that were carried downstream to the assembled networks of bacteria that reported on their presence. Furthermore, active signal modulation of among distal populations was demonstrated in a \"programmed\" manner where \"enhancer\" and \"reducer\" communities were assembled adjacent to the test population or \"reporter\" cells. The modulator cells either amplified or attenuated the cell-cell signalling between the distal, already communicating cell populations. Modulation was quantified with a bioassay, and the reaction rates of signal production and consumption were further characterized using a first principles mathematical model. Simulated distribution profiles of signalling molecules in the cell-gel composites agreed well with the observed cellular responses.

IRE uses electrical pulses to increase membrane permeability by altering the transmembrane potential; past a threshold, damage to the cell becomes too great and leads to cell death. We hypothesized that using IRE to kill the bacteria at specific locations and particular times, we could introduce conduits in the overall scaffold by preventing cellulose biosynthesis locally. Through mathematical modeling and experimental techniques, electrical effects were investigated and the parameters for IRE of G. xylinus were determined. We found that for a specific set of parameters, an applied electric field of 8 to 12.5\u00a0kV/cm, producing a local field of 3 kV/cm, was sufficient to kill most of\u00a0the bacteria and create a localized pore. However,\u00a0an applied electric field of 17.5\u00a0kV/cm was required to kill all.

While still largely grounded in cadaveric dissection, this method of instruction is constrained in some countries and regional areas by access to real human cadavers, costs of cadaver bequest programmes, health and safety of students and staff and the shortage of adequate time in modern curricula. Many candidates choosing a postgraduate pathway in ophthalmological training, such as those accepted into the Royal Colleges of Ophthalmology in the UK, Australia and New Zealand programmes and the American Academy of Ophthalmologists in the USA, are compelled as adult learners to revise or revisit human orbital anatomy, ocular anatomy and select areas of head and neck anatomy.

A custom radiochromic film dosimetry apparatus was 3D-printed in PC-ISO with a single catheter channel and a slit to hold a film segment. The apparatus was designed specifically to test geometry pertinent for use of this material in a clinical setting. A brachytherapy dose plan was computed to deliver a cylindrical dose distribution to the film. The dose plan used an 192Ir source and was normalized to 1500 cGy at 1 cm from the channel. The material was evaluated by comparing the film exposure to an identical test done in water. The Hounsfield unit (HU) distributions were computed from a CT scan of the apparatus and compared to the HU distribution of water and the HU distribution of a commercial GYN cylinder applicator. The dose depth curve of PC-ISO as measured by the radiochromic film was within 1% of water between 1 cm and 6 cm from the channel. The mean HU was -10 for PC-ISO and -1 for water. As expected, the honeycombed structure of the PC-ISO 3D printing process created a moderate spread of HU values, but the mean was comparable to water.

Proper evaluation and surgical planning are necessary to achieve the pelvic ring symmetry and stable fixation of the fracture. The goal of this study was to assess the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques for surgical management of old pelvic fractures.\nFirst, 16 dried human cadaveric pelvises were used to confirm the anatomical accuracy of the 3D models printed based on radiographic data. Next, nine clinical cases between January 2009 and April 2013 were used to evaluate the surgical reconstruction based on the 3D printed models. The pelvic injuries were all type C, and the average time from injury to reconstruction was 11 weeks (range: 8-17 weeks). The workflow consisted of: (1) Printing patient-specific bone models based on preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, (2) virtual fracture reduction using the printed 3D anatomic template, (3) virtual fracture fixation using Kirschner wires, and (4) preoperatively measuring the osteotomy and implant position relative to landmarks using the virtually defined deformation. These models aided communication between surgical team members during the procedure. This technique was validated by comparing the preoperative planning to the intraoperative procedure.\nThe accuracy of the 3D printed models was within specification. Production of a model from standard CT DICOM data took 7 hours (range: 6-9 hours). Preoperative planning using the 3D printed models was feasible in all cases. Good correlation was found between the preoperative planning and postoperative follow-up X-ray in all nine cases. The patients were followed for 3-29 months (median: 5 months). The fracture healing time was 9-17 weeks (mean: 10 weeks). No delayed incision healing, wound infection, or nonunions occurred. The results were excellent in two cases, good in five, and poor in two based on the Majeed score.\nThe 3D printing planning technique for pelvic surgery was successfully integrated into a clinical workflow to improve patient-specific preoperative planning by providing a visual and haptic model of the injury and allowing patient-specific adaptation of each osteosynthesis implant to the virtually reduced pelvis.", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "date": "2015-02-13", "authors": ["Xin-BaoWu", "Jun-QiangWang", "Chun-PengZhao", "XuSun", "YinShi", "Zi-AnZhang", "Yu-NengLi", "Man-YiWang"], "doi": "10.4103/0366-6999.151088"}

{"title": "Design control for clinical translation of 3D printed modular scaffolds.", "abstract": "The primary thrust of tissue engineering is the clinical translation of scaffolds and/or biologics to reconstruct tissue defects. Despite this thrust, clinical translation of tissue engineering therapies from academic research has been minimal in the 27 year history of tissue engineering. Academic research by its nature focuses on, and rewards, initial discovery of new phenomena and technologies in the basic research model, with a view towards generality. Translation, however, by its nature must be directed at specific clinical targets, also denoted as indications, with associated regulatory requirements. These regulatory requirements, especially design control, require that the clinical indication be precisely defined a priori, unlike most academic basic tissue engineering research where the research target is typically open-ended, and furthermore requires that the tissue engineering therapy be constructed according to design inputs that ensure it treats or mitigates the clinical indication. Finally, regulatory approval dictates that the constructed system be verified, i.e., proven that it meets the design inputs, and validated, i.e., that by meeting the design inputs the therapy will address the clinical indication. Satisfying design control requires (1) a system of integrated technologies (scaffolds, materials, biologics), ideally based on a fundamental platform, as compared to focus on a single technology, (2) testing of design hypotheses to validate system performance as opposed to mechanistic hypotheses of natural phenomena, and (3) sequential testing using in vitro, in vivo, large preclinical and eventually clinical tests against competing therapies, as compared to single experiments to test new technologies or test mechanistic hypotheses. Our goal in this paper is to illustrate how design control may be implemented in academic translation of scaffold based tissue engineering therapies. Specifically, we propose to (1) demonstrate a modular platform approach founded on 3D printing for developing tissue engineering therapies and (2) illustrate the design control process for modular implementation of two scaffold based tissue engineering therapies: airway reconstruction and bone tissue engineering based spine fusion.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-02-11", "authors": ["Scott JHollister", "Colleen LFlanagan", "David AZopf", "Robert JMorrison", "HassanNasser", "Janki JPatel", "EdwardEbramzadeh", "Sophia NSangiorgio", "Matthew BWheeler", "Glenn EGreen"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1270-2"}
{"title": "Rheology as a tool for evaluation of melt processability of innovative dosage forms.", "abstract": "Future manufacturing of pharmaceuticals will involve innovative use of polymeric excipients. Hot melt extrusion (HME) is an already established manufacturing technique and several products based on HME are on the market. Additionally, processing based on, e.g., HME or three dimensional (3D) printing, will have an increasingly important role when designing products for flexible dosing, since dosage forms based on compacting of a given powder mixture do not enable manufacturing of optimal pharmaceutical products for personalized treatments. The melt processability of polymers and API-polymer mixtures is highly dependent on the rheological properties of these systems, and rheological measurements should be considered as a more central part of the material characterization tool box when selecting suitable candidates for melt processing by, e.g., HME or 3D printing. The polymer processing industry offers established platforms, methods, and models for rheological characterization, and they can often be readily applied in the field of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Thoroughly measured and calculated rheological parameters together with thermal and mechanical material data are needed for the process simulations which are also becoming increasingly important. The authors aim to give an overview to the basics of rheology and summarize examples of the studies where rheology has been utilized in setting up or evaluating extrusion processes.

{"title": "Tissue Engineering Applications of Three-Dimensional Bioprinting.", "abstract": "Recent advances in tissue engineering have adapted the additive manufacturing technology, also known as three-dimensional printing, which is used in several industrial applications, for the fabrication of bioscaffolds and viable tissue and/or organs to overcome the limitations of other in vitro conventional methods. 3D bioprinting technology has gained enormous attention as it enabled 3D printing of a multitude of biocompatible materials, different types of cells and other supporting growth factors into complex functional living tissues in a 3D format. A major advantage of this technology is its ability for simultaneously 3D printing various cell types in defined spatial locations, which makes this technology applicable to regenerative medicine to meet the need for suitable for transplantation suitable organs and tissues. 3D bioprinting is yet to successfully overcome the many challenges related to building 3D structures that closely resemble native organs and tissues, which are complex structures with defined microarchitecture and a variety of cell types in a confined area. An integrated approach with a combination of technologies from the fields of engineering, biomaterials science, cell biology, physics, and medicine is required to address these complexities. Meeting this challenge is being made possible by directing the 3D bioprinting to manufacture biomimetic-shaped 3D structures, using organ/tissue images, obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography, and employing computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies. Applications of 3D bioprinting include the generation of multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, heart valves, etc. The current 3D bioprinting technologies need to be improved with respect to the mechanical strength and integrity in the manufactured constructs as the presently used biomaterials are not of optimal viscosity.

The preoperative planning of anatomic matching plate with appropriate screw trajectories was performed with the help of the library of 3D models of implants. According to the optimal planning, patient-specific navigational templates produced by 3D printer were used to accurately guide the real surgical implantation. The fixation outcomes in term of the deviations of screw placement between preoperative and postoperative screw trajectories were measured and compared, including the screw lengths, entry point locations and screw directions. With virtual preoperative planning, we have achieved optimal and accurate fixation outcomes in the real clinical surgeries. The deviations of screw length was 1.57 \u00b1 5.77 mm, P > 0.05. The displacements of the entry points in the x-, y-, and z-axis were 0.23 \u00b1 0.62, 0.83 \u00b1 1.91, and 0.46 \u00b1 0.67 mm, respectively, P > 0.05.

{"title": "Use of the polycation polyethyleneimine to improve the physical properties of alginate-hyaluronic acid hydrogel during fabrication of tissue repair scaffolds.", "abstract": "Recently alginate-based tissue repair scaffolds fabricated using 3D printing techniques have been extensively examined for use in tissue engineering applications. However, their physical and mechanical properties are unfavorable for many tissue engineering applications because these properties are poorly controlled during the fabrication process. Some improvement of alginate gel properties can be realized by addition of hyaluronic acid (HA), and this may also improve the ability of cells to interact with the gel. Here, we report improvement of the physical properties of alginate-HA gel scaffolds by the addition of the polycation polyethyleneimine (PEI) during the fabrication process in order to stabilize alginate molecular structure through the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex. We find that PEI has a significant beneficial influence on alginate-HA scaffold physical properties, including a reduction in the degree of gel swelling, a reduction in scaffold degradation rate, and an increase in the Young's modulus of the gel. Further study shows that fabrication of alginate-HA gels with PEI increases the encapsulation efficiency of bovine serum albumin, a model protein, and reduces the subsequent initial protein release rate. However, it was also found that survival of Schwann cells or ATDC-5 chondrogenic cells encapsulated during the scaffold fabrication process was modestly reduced with increasing PEI concentration. This study illustrates that the use of PEI during scaffold fabrication by plotting can provide an effective means to control alginate-based scaffold properties for tissue engineering applications, but that the many effects of PEI must be balanced for optimal outcomes in different situations.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

{"title": "Investigating the accuracy of microstereotactic-body-radiotherapy utilizing anatomically accurate 3D printed rodent-morphic dosimeters.", "abstract": "Sophisticated small animal irradiators, incorporating cone-beam-CT image-guidance, have recently been developed which enable exploration of the efficacy of advanced radiation treatments in the preclinical setting. Microstereotactic-body-radiation-therapy (microSBRT) is one technique of interest, utilizing field sizes in the range of 1-15 mm. Verification of the accuracy of microSBRT treatment delivery is challenging due to the lack of available methods to comprehensively measure dose distributions in representative phantoms with sufficiently high spatial resolution and in 3 dimensions (3D). This work introduces a potential solution in the form of anatomically accurate rodent-morphic 3D dosimeters compatible with ultrahigh resolution (0.3 mm(3)) optical computed tomography (optical-CT) dose read-out.\nRodent-morphic dosimeters were produced by 3D-printing molds of rodent anatomy directly from contours defined on x-ray CT data sets of rats and mice, and using these molds to create tissue-equivalent radiochromic 3D dosimeters from Presage. Anatomically accurate spines were incorporated into some dosimeters, by first 3D printing the spine mold, then forming a high-Z bone equivalent spine insert. This spine insert was then set inside the tissue equivalent body mold. The high-Z spinal insert enabled representative cone-beam CT IGRT targeting. On irradiation, a linear radiochromic change in optical-density occurs in the dosimeter, which is proportional to absorbed dose, and was read out using optical-CT in high-resolution (0.5 mm isotropic voxels). Optical-CT data were converted to absolute dose in two ways: (i) using a calibration curve derived from other Presage dosimeters from the same batch, and (ii) by independent measurement of calibrated dose at a point using a novel detector comprised of a yttrium oxide based nanocrystalline scintillator, with a submillimeter active length. A microSBRT spinal treatment was delivered consisting of a 180\u00b0 continuous arc at 225 kVp with a 20 \u00d7 10 mm field size. Dose response was evaluated using both the Presage/optical-CT 3D dosimetry system described above, and independent verification in select planes using EBT2 radiochromic film placed inside rodent-morphic dosimeters that had been sectioned in half.\nRodent-morphic 3D dosimeters were successfully produced from Presage radiochromic material by utilizing 3D printed molds of rat CT contours. The dosimeters were found to be compatible with optical-CT dose readout in high-resolution 3D (0.5 mm isotropic voxels) with minimal artifacts or noise. Cone-beam CT image guidance was possible with these dosimeters due to sufficient contrast between high-Z spinal inserts and tissue equivalent Presage material (CNR \u223c10 on CBCT images). Dose at isocenter measured with optical-CT was found to agree with nanoscintillator measurement to within 2.8%. Maximum dose in line profiles taken through Presage and film dose slices agreed within 3%, with FWHM measurements through each profile found to agree within 2%.\nThis work demonstrates the feasibility of using 3D printing technology to make anatomically accurate Presage rodent-morphic dosimeters incorporating spinal-mimicking inserts. High quality optical-CT 3D dosimetry is feasible on these dosimeters, despite the irregular surfaces and implanted inserts. The ability to measure dose distributions in anatomically accurate phantoms represents a powerful useful additional verification tool for preclinical microSBRT.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2015-02-06", "authors": ["Steven TBache", "TitaniaJuang", "Matthew DBelley", "Bridget FKoontz", "JohnAdamovics", "Terry TYoshizumi", "David GKirsch", "MarkOldham"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4905489\n10.1088/0031-9155/56/12/R01\n10.1088/0031-9155/53/11/013\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.04.025\n10.1088/0031-9155/55/23/011\n10.1118/1.4866215\n10.1118/1.3533947\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042133\n10.1118/1.3663675\n10.1088/0031-9155/56/8/016\n10.1088/0031-9155/58/10/3377\n10.1016/j.radonc.2013.10.003\n10.1016/j.zemedi.2014.02.004\n10.1118/1.1776415\n10.1093/rpd/nci555\n10.1118/1.2804616\n10.1118/1.3561509\n10.1088/0031-9155/58/21/7791\n10.3791/50250\n10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001\n10.1118/1.3611042\n10.1039/c4nr00497c\n10.1118/1.3373523\n10.1088/0031-9155/56/11/014\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.12.015\n10.1118/1.4884018"}

For these applications, the accuracy of the AM models is essential. Unfortunately, this accuracy is compromised due to errors introduced by each of the building steps: image acquisition, segmentation, triangulation, printing and infiltration. However, the contribution of each step to the final error remains unclear. We performed a sensitivity analysis comparing errors obtained from a reference with those obtained modifying parameters of each building step. Our analysis considered global indexes to evaluate the overall error, and local indexes to show how this error is distributed along the surface of the AM models. Our results show that the standard building process tends to overestimate the AM models, i.e. models are larger than the original structures. They also show that the triangulation resolution and the segmentation threshold are critical factors, and that the errors are concentrated at regions with high curvatures.

{"title": "Synchronicity in composite hydrogels: Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) active nodes in gelatin.", "abstract": "Synchronization of motion, task, or communication is responsible for the successful function of many living systems. Composite Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) self-oscillating hydrogels exhibit a sufficiently complex chemical-mechanical feedback to develop synchrony and other dynamical behaviors. In the context of BZ gels, synchrony is the sustained, oscillating oxidation with constant phase of two or more catalyst-immobilized gel segments. However, design criteria to control chemical-mechanical synchronization through patterning of the reaction catalyst are lacking. To characterize the fundamental units of composite device design, the periodic oxidation behavior of isolated nodes, node pairs, and multinode systems were investigated. Isolated nodes of Ru-immobilized gelatin exhibited three distinct, volume-dependent, regimes of oscillation: (i) long period (10-40 min), (ii) biperiod (mix of long and short), and (iii) short period (2.5 min). Node pairs and multinode grids of Ru gelatin were embedded in plain gelatin through a film stacking or 3D printing technique. The fraction of synchronized node pairs decreased with increasing interspace distance. Embedment increased the probability of synchronization, with 100% synchronization for interspace distances of less than 10 times the characteristic length of the reaction-diffusion process. The phase difference between synchronized node pairs transitioned from in-phase at small interspace distances to antiphase at large distances, providing the first experimental verification of antiphase synchrony in composite BZ gels. From these design criteria and fabrication techniques, the chemical-mechanical feedback of BZ composites can be programmed through strategic patterning of the catalyst to build BZ devices for sensor, trigger, or chemical computing applications.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Results show that a limited number of unit-cells (3-5 repeated on a side) introduce some scale-effects but the discrepancies are below 10%.

Since recombinant spider silk proteins are non-immunogenic, cytocompatible, and exhibit physical crosslinking, their potential as a new bioink system was evaluated. Cell-loaded spider silk constructs can be printed by robotic dispensing without the need for crosslinking additives or thickeners for mechanical stabilization. Cells are able to adhere and proliferate with good viability over at least one week in such spider silk scaffolds. Introduction of a cell-binding motif to the spider silk protein further enables fine-tuned control over cell-material interactions. Spider silk hydrogels are thus a highly attractive novel bioink for biofabrication.", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["KristinSchacht", "TomaszJ\u00fcngst", "MatthiasSchweinlin", "AndreaEwald", "J\u00fcrgenGroll", "ThomasScheibel"], "doi": "10.1002/anie.201409846"}

Nitrofurantoin (NF) and hydroxyapatite (HA) were successfully mixed and extruded with up to 30% drug load with and without addition of 5% HA in polylactide strands, which were subsequently 3D-printed into model disc geometries (10 \u00d7 2 mm). X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that NF maintained its anhydrate solid form during the processing. Release of NF from the disks was dependent on the drug loading in a concentration-dependent manner as a higher level of released drug was observed from disks with higher drug loads. Disks with 30% drug loading were able to prevent surface-associated and planktonic growth of Staphylococcus aureus over a period of 7 days. At 10% drug loading, the disks did not inhibit planktonic growth, but still inhibited surface-associated growth. Elemental analysis indicated the presence of microdomains of solid drug supporting the observed slow and partial drug release.

{"title": "Prospect for kidney bioengineering: shortcomings of the status quo.", "abstract": "Dialysis and renal transplantation are the only two therapeutic options offered to patients affected by end-stage kidney disease; however, neither treatment can be considered definitive. In fact, dialysis is able to replace only the filtration function of the kidney without substituting its endocrine and metabolic roles, and dramatically impacts on patient's quality of life. On the other hand, kidney transplantation is severely limited by the shortage of transplantable organs, the need for immunosuppressive therapies and a narrow half-life. Regenerative medicine approaches are promising tools aiming to improve this condition.\nCell therapies, bioartificial kidney, organ bioengineering, 3D printer and kidney-on-chip represent the most appealing areas of research for the treatment of end-stage kidney failure. The scope of this review is to summarize the state of the art, limits and directions of each branch.\nIn the future, these emerging technologies could provide definitive, curative and theoretically infinite options for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease. Progress in stem cells-based therapies, decellularization techniques and the more recent scientific know-how for the use of the 3D printer and kidney-on-chip could lead to a perfect cellular-based therapy, the futuristic creation of a bioengineered kidney in the lab or to a valid bioartificial alternative.", "journal": "Expert opinion on biological therapy", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["AndreaPeloso", "RaviKatari", "Sean VMurphy", "Joao PZambon", "AnnaDeFrancesco", "Alan CFarney", "JeffreyRogers", "Robert JStratta", "Tommaso MManzia", "GiuseppeOrlando"], "doi": "10.1517/14712598.2015.993376"}

As part of this renewed emphasis on the improvement of manufacturing, the pharmaceutical industry has begun to develop more efficient production processes with more intensive use of online measurement and sensing, real-time quality control, and process control tools. Here, we present dropwise additive manufacturing of pharmaceutical products (DAMPP) as an alternative to conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing methods. This mini-manufacturing process for the production of pharmaceuticals utilizes drop on demand printing technology for automated and controlled deposition of melt-based formulations onto edible substrates. The advantages of drop-on-demand technology, including reproducible production of small droplets, adjustable drop sizing, high placement accuracy, and flexible use of different formulations, enable production of individualized dosing even for low-dose and high-potency drugs.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold seeded with fibrin/chondrocytes as a new dorsal augmentation material for rhinoplasty. The construct was surgically implanted on the nasal dorsum in the subperiosteal plane of six rabbits. The implants were harvested 4 and 12\u00a0weeks after implantation and evaluated by gross morphological assessment, radiographic imaging, and histologic examination. The initial shape of the implant was unchanged in all cases, and no definite post-operative complications were seen over the 3-month period. Radiologic evaluation confirmed that implants remained in the initial location without migration or extrusion. Histologic evaluations showed that the scaffold architectures were maintained with minimal inflammatory reactions; however, expected neo-chondrogenesis was not definite in the constructs.

With an increase in the demand for devices to perform in fragile and confined biological environments, it is crucial to develop new miniaturized, biocompatible 3D systems. Fabrication of materials at different scales with different properties makes 3D printing an ideal system for creating frameworks for small-scale robotics. 3D printing has been applied for the design of externally powered, artificial microswimmers and studying their locomotive capabilities in different fluids. Printed materials have also been incorporated with motile cells for bio-hybrid robots capable of functioning by cell contraction and swimming.

{"title": "Evaluating changes in structure and cytotoxicity during in vitro degradation of three-dimensional printed scaffolds.", "abstract": "This study evaluated the structural, mechanical, and cytocompatibility changes of three-dimensional (3D) printed porous polymer scaffolds during degradation. Three porous scaffold designs were fabricated from a poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) resin. PPF is a hydrolytically degradable polymer that has been well characterized for applications in bone tissue engineering. Over a 224 day period, scaffolds were hydrolytically degraded and changes in scaffold parameters, such as porosity and pore size, were measured nondestructively using micro-computed tomography. In addition, changes in scaffold mechanical properties were also measured during degradation. Scaffold degradation was verified through decreasing pH and increasing mass loss as well as the formation of micropores and surface channels. Current methods to evaluate polymer cytotoxicity have been well established; however, the ability to evaluate toxicity of an absorbable polymer as it degrades has not been well explored. This study, therefore, also proposes a novel method to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the absorbable scaffolds using a combination of degradation extract, phosphate-buffered saline, and cell culture media. Fibroblasts were incubated with this combination media, and cytotoxicity was evaluated using XTT assay and fluorescence imaging. Cell culture testing demonstrated that the 3D-printed scaffold extracts did not induce significant cell death. In addition, results showed that over a 224 day time period, porous PPF scaffolds provided mechanical stability while degrading. Overall, these results show that degradable, 3D-printed PPF scaffolds are suitable for bone tissue engineering through the use of a novel toxicity during degradation assay.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Preliminary results demonstrate that combining gentamicin and methotrexate with polylactic acid forms a composite possessing a superior combination of strength, versatility, and enhanced drug delivery. Antibacterial effects and a reduction in proliferation of osteosarcoma cells were observed with all constructs, attesting to the technical and clinical viability of our composites.

{"title": "Excitability Modulation of Oscillating Media in 3D-Printed Structures.", "abstract": "Excitation and oscillation are central to living systems. For excitable systems, which can be brought into oscillation by an external stimulus, the excitation threshold is a crucial parameter. This is evident for neurons, which only generate an action potential when exposed to a sufficiently high concentration of excitatory neurotransmitters, which may only be achieved when multiple presynaptic axons deliver their action potential simultaneously to the synaptic cleft. Dynamic systems composed of relatively simple chemicals are of interest because they can serve as a model for physiological processes or can be exploited to implement chemical computing. With these applications in mind, we have studied the properties of the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction in 3D-printed reaction vessels with open channels of different dimensions. It is demonstrated that the channel geometry can be used to modulate the excitability of the BZ medium, switching a continuously oscillating medium to an excitable medium. Because large networks of channel-connected reaction wells of different depth can easily be fabricated by 3D printing, local excitability modulation could be built into the structure of the reaction vessel itself, opening the way to more extensive experimentation with networks of chemical oscillators.", "journal": "Artificial life", "date": "2015-01-27", "authors": ["Philip HKing", "Chinnu HAbraham", "Klaus-PeterZauner", "Maurits R Rde Planque"], "doi": "10.1162/ARTL_a_00158"}

Local delivery is a possible solution to this problem. We used 3D printing to develop a CsA-loaded 3D drug carrier for the purpose of local and sustained delivery of CsA. The carrier is a hybrid of CsA-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microsphere-loaded hydrogel and a polymeric framework so that external force can be endured under physiological conditions. The expression of cytokines, which are secreted by spleen cells activated by Con A, and which are related to immune rejection, was significantly decreased in vitro by the released CsA from the drug carrier. Drug carriers seeded with xenogeneic cells (human lung fibroblast) were subcutaneously implanted into the BALB/c mouse. As a result, T-cell-mediated rejection was also significantly suppressed for 4 weeks.

However, as yet, this regime has hardly been addressed. Here we present the first time-resolved experimental investigation of microdroplet impact at velocities up to V0 = 50 m s(-1), on hydrophilic and -phobic surfaces at frame rates exceeding 10(7) frames per second. A novel method to determine the 3D-droplet profile at sub-micron resolution at the same frame rates is presented, using the fringe pattern observed from a bottom view. A numerical model, which is validated by the side- and bottom-view measurements, is employed to study the viscous boundary layer inside the droplet and the development of the rim. The spreading dynamics, the maximal spreading diameter, the boundary layer thickness, the rim formation, and the air bubble entrainment are compared to theory and previous experiments. In general, the impact dynamics are equal to millimeter-sized droplet impact for equal Reynolds-, Weber- and Stokes numbers (Re, We, and St, respectively). Using our numerical model, effective scaling laws for the progression of the boundary layer thickness and the rim diameter are provided. The dimensionless boundary layer thickness develops in time (t) according to \u03b4BL ~ D0/\u221aRe(t/\u03c4)0.45, and the diameter of the rim develops as DRim ~ D0/\u221aWe(t/\u03c4)0.68, with drop diameter D0 and inertial time scale \u03c4 = D0/V0.

{"title": "Custom-tailored tissue engineered polycaprolactone scaffolds for total disc replacement.", "abstract": "Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) represents a significant musculoskeletal disease burden. Tissue engineering has proposed several strategies comprising the use of biodegradable materials to prepare scaffolds that can present mechanical properties similar to those of native IVD tissues. However, this might be insufficient, since the patient's intervertebral space geometry must be replicated to allow for appropriate implant fixation and integration. Herein, we propose the use of reverse engineering and rapid prototyping techniques with the goal of preparing custom-tailored annulus fibrosus scaffolds; these techniques have previously been applied to rabbit models. The IVD reverse-engineered architecture was obtained by means of microcomputed tomography acquisition and three-dimensional modelling, resulting in a computer-aided design (CAD) that replicates the original rabbit IVD. Later, a fused deposition-modelling three-dimensional printer was used to produce the scaffolds with different geometries provided by the CAD, using polycaprolactone (PCL) with 100% infill density. The microstructure of the PCL scaffolds was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which allowed us to observe an adequate fusion adhesion between the layers. The SEM images revealed that, up to the point of moderate resolution, the porosities manually designed in the CAD model were successfully replicated. The PCL scaffolds' three-dimensional architecture was also assessed by means of microcomputed tomography analysis. Compressive stiffness was determined using a mechanical testing system. Results showed higher values than those of human IVDs (5.9-6.7 kN mm(-1) versus 1.2 kN mm(-1), respectively). In vitro studies were performed to investigate the possible cytotoxicity of the polycaprolactone scaffolds' leachables. The results showed that the custom-tailored PCL scaffolds do not have any deleterious cytotoxic effect over annulus fibrosus cells or the mouse lung fibroblast's cell line. This study proposed a simple, rapid, and low-cost strategy to fabricate custom-tailored annulus fibrosus scaffolds. In the future, this strategy might be used in association with nucleus pulposus regeneration strategies to facilitate the development of tissue-engineered total disc replacement implants specific to each patient, with a goal of full IVD regeneration.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-01-22", "authors": ["Svan Uden", "JSilva-Correia", "V MCorrelo", "J MOliveira", "R LReis"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015008"}

{"title": "A low-molecular-weight oil cleaner for removal of leftover silicone oil intraocular tamponade.", "abstract": "Silicone oil (SO) has been used as a long-term intraocular tamponade in treating retinal diseases for more than half a decade. However, its propensity to form tiny SO droplets is associated with a number of complications. Currently there is no effective way to remove such droplets from the eye cavity. In this work, a novel cleaner was developed for effective removal of these droplets.\nThe cleaner promotes the formation of an oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) double-emulsion that consists of the unwanted droplets as the innermost oil phase. The cleaner's ability to encapsulate SO droplets was tested using both in vitro microdevices and ex vivo porcine eye models. The efficiency of the cleaner in removing the SO droplets was quantified using the three-dimensional (3D) printed eye model. Both the volatility and in vitro cytotoxicity of the cleaner were evaluated on three retinal cell lines.\nCleaner 1.0 is volatile and has an evaporation rate of 0.14 mL/h at room temperature. The formation of O/W/O double-emulsion indicates the encapsulation of SO droplets by the cleaner. In the 3D printed eye model, rinsing with cleaner 1.0 led to a significant reduction of leftover SO droplets compared with 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; P < 0.05; n = 6). Cleaner 1.0 did not cause significant cell death (3%-6%) compared with balance salt solution (BSS; 1%-3%) in all three cell lines. The reduction in the cell viability due to cleaner 1.0, relative to that of BSS, was significant only in ARPE-19 cells (27%; P < 0.05) but not in the other two cell lines (8% and 17%, respectively; P > 0.05).\nThe double-emulsification approach was effective in removing remnant droplets from the eye cavities, and the cleaner was compatible with common cell types encountered in human eyes.

{"title": "Cyborg beast: a low-cost 3d-printed prosthetic hand for children with upper-limb differences.", "abstract": "There is an increasing number of children with traumatic and congenital hand amputations or reductions. Children's prosthetic needs are complex due to their small size, constant growth, and psychosocial development. Families' financial resources play a crucial role in the prescription of prostheses for their children, especially when private insurance and public funding are insufficient. Electric-powered (i.e., myoelectric) and body-powered (i.e., mechanical) devices have been developed to accommodate children's needs, but the cost of maintenance and replacement represents an obstacle for many families. Due to the complexity and high cost of these prosthetic hands, they are not accessible to children from low-income, uninsured families or to children from developing countries. Advancements in computer-aided design (CAD) programs, additive manufacturing, and image editing software offer the possibility of designing, printing, and fitting prosthetic hands devices at a distance and at very low cost. The purpose of this preliminary investigation was to describe a low-cost three-dimensional (3D)-printed prosthetic hand for children with upper-limb reductions and to propose a prosthesis fitting methodology that can be performed at a distance.\nNo significant mean differences were found between the anthropometric and range of motion measurements taken directly from the upper limbs of subjects versus those extracted from photographs. The Bland and Altman plots show no major bias and narrow limits of agreements for lengths and widths and small bias and wider limits of agreements for the range of motion measurements. The main finding of the survey was that our prosthetic device may have a significant potential to positively impact quality of life and daily usage, and can be incorporated in several activities at home and in school.\nThis investigation describes a low-cost 3D-printed prosthetic hand for children and proposes a distance fitting procedure. The Cyborg Beast prosthetic hand and the proposed distance-fitting procedures may represent a possible low-cost alternative for children in developing countries and those who have limited access to health care providers.

{"title": "In vivo endothelization of tubular vascular grafts through in situ recruitment of endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells by RGD-fused mussel adhesive proteins.", "abstract": "The use of tissue mimics in vivo, including patterned vascular networks, is expected to facilitate the regeneration of functional tissues and organs with large volumes. Maintaining patency of channels in contact with blood is an important issue in the development of a functional vascular network. Endothelium is the only known completely non-thrombogenic material; however, results from treatments to induce endothelialization are inconclusive. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical applicability of in situ recruitment of endothelial cells/endothelial progenitor cells (EC/EPC) and pre-endothelization using a recombinant mussel adhesive protein fused with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide (MAP-RGD) coating in a model of vascular graft implantation. Microporous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were fabricated with salt leaching methods and their surfaces were modified with collagen and MAP-RGD. We then evaluated their anti-thrombogenicity with an in vitro hemocompatibility assessment and a 4-week implantation in the rabbit carotid artery. We observed that MAP-RGD coating reduced the possibility of early in vivo graft failure and enhanced re-endothelization by in situ recruitment of EC/EPC (patency rate: 2/3), while endothelization prior to implantation aggravated the formation of thrombosis and/or IH (patency rate: 0/3). The results demonstrated that in situ recruitment of EC/EPC by MAP-RGD could be a promising strategy for vascular applications. In addition, it rules out several issues associated with pre-endothelization, such as cell source, purity, functional modulation and contamination. Further evaluation of long term performance and angiogenesis from the luminal surface may lead to the clinical use of MAP-RGD for tubular vascular grafts and regeneration of large-volume tissues with functional vascular networks.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-01-21", "authors": ["Tae-YunKang", "Jung HoLee", "Bum JinKim", "Jo-AKang", "Jung MinHong", "Byoung SooKim", "Hyung JoonCha", "Jong-WonRhie", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015007"}
{"title": "Metal ion-assisted self-assembly of complexes for controlled and sustained release of minocycline for biomedical applications.", "abstract": "This study reports the development of novel drug delivery complexes self-assembled by divalent metal ion-assisted coacervation for controlled and sustained release of a hydrophilic small drug molecule minocycline hydrochloride (MH). MH is a multifaceted agent that has demonstrated therapeutic effects in infection, inflammation, tumor, as well as cardiovascular, renal, and neurological disorders due to its anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties. However, the inability to translate the high doses used in experimental animals to tolerable doses in human patients limits its clinical application. Localized delivery can potentially expose the diseased tissue to high concentrations of MH that systemic delivery cannot achieve, while minimizing the side effects from systemic exposure. The strong metal ion binding-assisted interaction enabled high drug entrapment and loading efficiency, and stable long term release for more than 71 d. Released MH demonstrated potent anti-biofilm, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. Furthermore, MH release from the complexes is pH-sensitive as the chelation between minocycline and metal ions decreases with pH, allowing 'smart' drug release in response to the severity of pathology-induced tissue acidosis. This novel metal ion binding-mediated drug delivery mechanism can potentially be applied to other drugs that have high binding affinity for metal ions and may lead to the development of new delivery systems for a variety of drugs.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-01-21", "authors": ["ZhilingZhang", "ZhichengWang", "JiaNong", "Camilla ANix", "Hai-FengJi", "YinghuiZhong"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015006"}

{"title": "3D Printing technology over a drug delivery for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Many researchers have attempted to use computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) to realize a scaffold that provides a three-dimensional (3D) environment for regeneration of tissues and organs. As a result, several 3D printing technologies, including stereolithography, deposition modeling, inkjet-based printing and selective laser sintering have been developed. Because these 3D printing technologies use computers for design and fabrication, and they can fabricate 3D scaffolds as designed; as a consequence, they can be standardized. Growth of target tissues and organs requires the presence of appropriate growth factors, so fabrication of 3Dscaffold systems that release these biomolecules has been explored. A drug delivery system (DDS) that administrates a pharmaceutical compound to achieve a therapeutic effect in cells, animals and humans is a key technology that delivers biomolecules without side effects caused by excessive doses. 3D printing technologies and DDSs have been assembled successfully, so new possibilities for improved tissue regeneration have been suggested.

{"title": "Relationship between unit cell type and porosity and the fatigue behavior of selective laser melted meta-biomaterials.", "abstract": "Meta-materials are structures when their small-scale properties are considered, but behave as materials when their homogenized macroscopic properties are studied. There is an intimate relationship between the design of the small-scale structure and the homogenized properties of such materials. In this article, we studied that relationship for meta-biomaterials that are aimed for biomedical applications, otherwise known as meta-biomaterials. Selective laser melted porous titanium (Ti6Al4V ELI) structures were manufactured based on three different types of repeating unit cells, namely cube, diamond, and truncated cuboctahedron, and with different porosities. The morphological features, static mechanical properties, and fatigue behavior of the porous biomaterials were studied with a focus on their fatigue behavior. It was observed that, in addition to static mechanical properties, the fatigue properties of the porous biomaterials are highly dependent on the type of unit cell as well as on porosity. None of the porous structures based on the cube unit cell failed after 10(6) loading cycles even when the applied stress reached 80% of their yield strengths. For both other unit cells, higher porosities resulted in shorter fatigue lives for the same level of applied stress. When normalized with respect to their yield stresses, the S-N data points of structures with different porosities very well (R(2)>0.8) conformed to one single power law specific to the type of the unit cell. For the same level of normalized applied stress, the truncated cuboctahedron unit cell resulted in a longer fatigue life as compared to the diamond unit cell. In a similar comparison, the fatigue lives of the porous structures based on both truncated cuboctahedron and diamond unit cells were longer than that of the porous structures based on the rhombic dodecahedron unit cell (determined in a previous study).

The 3D geometry of scapula, skin, and surrounding soft tissues in the shoulder was reconstructed based on the anonymous CT data of a human subject in a prone posture (without loading on the shoulder) for FEM analysis of the contact stress. FEM analysis results show that the maximum stress is located at the prominence of the scapula with sharp bone geometry. This demonstrates that stress concentration at the bone prominence is a significant factor to cause the high contact stress, which is a source for pressure ulcers. For experimental validation, a physical shoulder model manufactured by 3D printing of the bone geometry and the mold for molding of tissue-mimicking silicone was developed. Compression tests of the mattress foam and silicone were conducted to find the nonlinear stress-strain relations as inputs for FEM. Experiments of compressing the shoulder model against the foam were carried out. Three flexible force sensors were embedded inside the model to measure the contact forces and compared to the FEM predictions.

Technical challenges are remaining as how to fabricate such 3D scaffolds with controlled surface topography from a range of biodegradable and biocompatible materials.

For this purpose, two strategies, namely, direct printing of a powder composition consisting of a 60:40 mixture of \u03b1/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) powder and alginate powder or vacuum infiltration of printed TCP scaffolds with an alginate solution, were tracked. Results of structural characterization revealed that the scaffolds printed with 2.5 wt% alginate-modified TCP powders presented a uniformly distributed and interfusing alginate TCP network. Mechanical results indicated a significant increase in strength, energy to failure and reliability of powder-modified scaffolds with an alginate content in the educts of 2.5 wt% when compared to pure TCP, as well as to TCP scaffolds containing 5 wt% or 7.5 wt% in the educts, in both dry and wet states. Culture of human osteoblast cells on these scaffolds also demonstrated a great improvement of cell proliferation and cell viability. While in the case of powder-mixed alginate TCP scaffolds, isolated alginate gels were formed between the calcium phosphate crystals, the vacuum-infiltration strategy resulted in the covering of the surface and internal pores of the TCP scaffold with a thin alginate film. Furthermore, the prediction of the scaffolds' critical fracture conditions under more complex stress states by the applied Mohr fracture criterion confirmed the potential of the powder-modified scaffolds with 2.5 wt% alginate in the educts as structural biomaterial for bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-01-07", "authors": ["MiguelCastilho", "JorgeRodrigues", "In\u00easPires", "BarbaraGouveia", "ManuelPereira", "ClausMoseke", "J\u00fcrgenGroll", "AndreaEwald", "ElkeVorndran"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015004"}

Understanding of the precise surgical anatomy is often challenging and can be inadequate or wrong. Modern high resolution imaging techniques and 3D printing technology allow 3D printing of the replicas of the patient's heart for precise understanding of the complex anatomy, hands-on simulation of surgical and interventional procedures, and morphology teaching of the medical professionals and patients. CT or MR images obtained with ECG-gating and breath-holding or respiration navigation are best suited for 3D printing. 3D echocardiograms are not ideal but can be used for printing limited areas of interest such as cardiac valves and ventricular septum. Although the print materials still require optimization for representation of cardiovascular tissues and valves, the surgeons find the models suitable for practicing closure of the septal defects, application of the baffles within the ventricles, reconstructing the aortic arch, and arterial switch procedure. Hands-on surgical training (HOST) on models may soon become a mandatory component of congenital heart disease surgery program. 3D printing will expand its utilization with further improvement of the use of echocardiographic data and image fusion algorithm across multiple imaging modalities and development of new printing materials.

This conversion, and the subsequent 3D printing of the STL file, requires a series of steps. Initial post-processing involves the segmentation-demarcation of the desired for 3D printing parts and creating of an initial STL file.

Images of two full-face transplantation patients scanned with non-contrast 320-detector row CT were reconstructed at fractions of the acquisition radiation dose using noise simulation software and both filtered back-projection (FBP) and Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D (AIDR3D). The maxillofacial bone STL model segmented with thresholding from AIDR3D images at 100 % dose was considered the reference. For all other dose/reconstruction method combinations, a \"residual STL volume\" was calculated as the topologic subtraction of the STL model derived from that dataset from the reference and correlated to radiation dose.\nThe residual volume decreased with increasing radiation dose and was lower for AIDR3D compared to FBP reconstructions at all doses. As a fraction of the reference STL volume, the residual volume decreased from 2.9 % (20 % dose) to 1.4 % (50 % dose) in patient 1, and from 4.1 % to 1.9 %, respectively in patient 2 for AIDR3D reconstructions.

Patient CT images were segmented into liver tissues, contrast-enhanced vessels, and liver lesions using commercial software, based on which stereolithography (STL) files were created and sent to a commercial 3D printer. A 3D liver phantom was printed after assigning different printing materials to each object to simulate appropriate attenuation of each segmented object. As high opacity materials are not available for the printer, we printed hollow vessels and filled them with iodine solutions of adjusted concentration to represent enhance levels in contrast-enhanced liver scans. The printed phantom was then placed in a 35\u00d726 cm oblong-shaped water phantom and scanned repeatedly at 4 dose levels. Images were reconstructed using standard filtered backprojection and an iterative reconstruction algorithm with 3 different strength settings. Heterogeneous liver background were observed from the CT images and the difference in CT numbers between lesions and background were representative for low contrast lesions in liver CT studies. CT numbers in vessels filled with iodine solutions represented the enhancement of liver arteries and veins. Images were run through a Channelized Hotelling model observer with Garbor channels and ROC analysis was performed.

{"title": "Microintaglio Printing for Soft Lithography-Based in Situ Microarrays.", "abstract": "Advances in lithographic approaches to fabricating bio-microarrays have been extensively explored over the last two decades. However, the need for pattern flexibility, a high density, a high resolution, affordability and on-demand fabrication is promoting the development of unconventional routes for microarray fabrication. This review highlights the development and uses of a new molecular lithography approach, called \"microintaglio printing technology\", for large-scale bio-microarray fabrication using a microreactor array (\u00b5RA)-based chip consisting of uniformly-arranged, femtoliter-size \u00b5RA molds. In this method, a single-molecule-amplified DNA microarray pattern is self-assembled onto a \u00b5RA mold and subsequently converted into a messenger RNA or protein microarray pattern by simultaneously producing and transferring (immobilizing) a messenger RNA or a protein from a \u00b5RA mold to a glass surface. Microintaglio printing allows the self-assembly and patterning of in situ-synthesized biomolecules into high-density (kilo-giga-density), ordered arrays on a chip surface with \u00b5m-order precision. This holistic aim, which is difficult to achieve using conventional printing and microarray approaches, is expected to revolutionize and reshape proteomics.

{"title": "3D Cell Culture in Alginate Hydrogels.", "abstract": "This review compiles information regarding the use of alginate, and in particular alginate hydrogels, in culturing cells in 3D. Knowledge of alginate chemical structure and functionality are shown to be important parameters in design of alginate-based matrices for cell culture. Gel elasticity as well as hydrogel stability can be impacted by the type of alginate used, its concentration, the choice of gelation technique (ionic or covalent), and divalent cation chosen as the gel inducing ion. The use of peptide-coupled alginate can control cell-matrix interactions. Gelation of alginate with concomitant immobilization of cells can take various forms. Droplets or beads have been utilized since the 1980s for immobilizing cells. Newer matrices such as macroporous scaffolds are now entering the\u00a03D cell culture product market. Finally, delayed gelling, injectable, alginate systems show utility in the translation of in vitro cell culture to in vivo tissue engineering applications. Alginate has a history and a future in 3D cell culture. Historically, cells were encapsulated in alginate droplets cross-linked with calcium for the development of artificial organs.

{"title": "The Use of a 3D Printer in Pre-operative Planning for a Patient Requiring Acetabular Reconstructive Surgery.", "abstract": "Surgical management of acetabular fractures is often highly complex, and a successful outcome depends upon an appreciation of the fracture pattern and the most appropriate approach to reduce and hold it. Currently, computed tomography (CT) images are used in conjunction with plain x-rays to identify the main fracture components and their spatial relationship to one another, and as such surgeons still have to make decisions based upon their ability to visualise the fracture from the images available. 3D printers have now become widely available and inexpensive, and can be used to rapidly produce life-size models based on CT scans of an individual patient. The availability of patient specific, accurate and detailed models of complex acetabular fractures can aid planning of surgical management on a patient specific basis.\nThis report describes the use of a 3D printer to create a life-size model reconstruction of the pelvis of a 48 year old male patient who sustained a left sided associated both column acetabular fracture following a motorbike accident in the Sahara Desert. The model allowed visualisation of the multiple fracture fragments and their relative displacements. The tactile feedback allowed assessment of the different fracture fragments. The relative displacement of the quadrilateral plate and posterior column fragments could be assessed and the surgeon felt that these would be amenable to reduction from an ilioinguinal approach. An anatomic reduction was achieved and was held with the application of a pelvic brim plate with 2 screws lagging the posterior column/quadrilateral plate fragment.\nThere are previous examples of 3D models being used in orthopaedic surgery through the use of rapid prototyping, however this method is usually expensive and time consuming. Advances in 3D printer technology offer surgeons a number of advantages when treating these complex fractures. With the ever-increasing economy, ease of use and speed of additive processing, the possible applications of this technology within orthopaedic surgery are numerous. Given the possible applications of this technology, and its ever increasing availability, we feel that its use can only improve patient outcomes and so should be explored further for use in orthopaedic surgery.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic case reports", "date": "2015-01-01", "authors": ["James MDuncan", "SamuelNahas", "KashifAkhtar", "JasvinderDaurka"], "doi": "10.13107/jocr.2250-0685.247"}

The ear is highly flexible yet tough, and has a very complex three-dimensional shape. Reconstruction of a patient's burned ear is even more complex due to surrounding tissue damage.

In such cases, rib cartilage is the preferred option, but this tissue has practical limitations too. For these reasons, tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting may have the potential to create personalized cartilage implants for burns patients.

However, limited vision in the operative site may lead to difficulties or complications during surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method for helping surgeons to perform MAO more precisely and safely.\nIn this study, we report a novel method of a computer image-guided surgical template for navigation of MAO, and evaluate its accuracy and clinical outcomes. Nine patients with a prominent mandibular angle were enrolled in this study. A pair of stereolithographic templates was fabricated by computer-aided image design and 3D printing. In all cases, bilateral MAO was performed under the guide of these templates.

{"title": "Bio-Pick, Place, and Perfuse: A New Instrument for Three-Dimensional Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "A grand challenge of tissue engineering is the fabrication of large constructs with a high density of living cells. By adapting the principles of pick-and-place machines used in the high-speed assembly of electronics, we have developed an innovative instrument, the Bio-Pick, Place, and Perfuse (Bio-P3), which picks up large complex multicellular building parts, transports them to a build area, and precisely places the parts at desired locations while perfusing the parts. These assembled parts subsequently fuse to form a larger contiguous tissue construct. Multicellular microtissues were formed by seeding cells into nonadhesive micro-molds, wherein cells self-assembled scaffold-free parts in the shape of spheroids, toroids, and honeycombs. After removal from the molds, the parts were gripped, transported (using an x, y, z controller), and released using the Bio-P3 with little to no effect on cell viability or part structure. As many as 16 toroids were stacked over a 170 \u03bcm diameter post where they fused over the course of 48 h to form a single tissue. Larger honeycomb parts were also gripped and stacked onto a build head that, like the gripper head, provided fluid suction to hold and perfuse the parts during assembly. Scaffold-free building parts help to address several of the engineering and biological challenges to large tissue biofabrication, and the Bio-P3 described in this article is a novel instrument for the controlled gripping, placing, stacking, and perfusing of living building parts for solid organ fabrication.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Channels can serve as vasculature enhancing medium perfusion or as conduits for nerve regeneration. The 3D biofabrication seems to be a promising method to generate these structures within 3D constructs layer-by-layer. In this study, geometry and interface of bioprinted channels were investigated with micro-computed tomography and fluorescent imaging. In filament printing, size and shape of printed channels are influenced by their orientation, which was analyzed by printing horizontally and vertically aligned channels, and by the ink, which was evaluated by comparing channels printed with an alginate-gelatin hydrogel or with an emulsion. The influence of geometry and cell-embedding in the hydrogel on feature size and shape was investigated by printing more complex channels. The generation of hollow channels, induced through leaching of a support phase, was monitored over time. Horizontally aligned channels provided 16\u00d7 smaller cross-sectional areas than channels in vertical orientation. The smallest feature size of hydrogel filaments was twice as large compared to emulsion filaments. Feature size and shape depended on the geometry but did not alter when living cells were embedded.

{"title": "Laser 3D printing with sub-microscale resolution of porous elastomeric scaffolds for supporting human bone stem cells.", "abstract": "A reproducible method is needed to fabricate 3D scaffold constructs that results in periodic and uniform structures with precise control at sub-micrometer and micrometer length scales. In this study, fabrication of scaffolds by two-photon polymerization (2PP) of a biodegradable urethane and acrylate-based photoelastomer is demonstrated. This material supports 2PP processing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. The high photoreactivity of the biophotoelastomer permits 2PP processing at a scanning speed of 1000 mm s(-1), facilitating rapid fabrication of relatively large structures (>5 mm(3)). These structures are custom printed for in vitro assay screening in 96-well plates and are sufficiently flexible to enable facile handling and transplantation. These results indicate that stable scaffolds with porosities of greater than 60% can be produced using 2PP. Human bone marrow stromal cells grown on 3D scaffolds exhibit increased growth and proliferation compared to smooth 2D scaffold controls. 3D scaffolds adsorb larger amounts of protein than smooth 2D scaffolds due to their larger surface area; the scaffolds also allow cells to attach in multiple planes and to completely infiltrate the porous scaffolds.

{"title": "Neurosurgical endoscopic training via a realistic 3-dimensional model with pathology.", "abstract": "Training in intraventricular endoscopy is particularly challenging because the volume of cases is relatively small and the techniques involved are unlike those usually used in conventional neurosurgery. Present training models are inadequate for various reasons. Using 3-dimensional (3D) printing techniques, models with pathology can be created using actual patient's imaging data. This technical article introduces a new training model based on a patient with hydrocephalus secondary to a pineal tumour, enabling the models to be used to simulate third ventriculostomies and pineal biopsies.\nMultiple models of the head of a patient with hydrocephalus were created using 3D rapid prototyping technique. These models were modified to allow for a fluid-filled ventricular system under appropriate tension. The models were qualitatively assessed in the various steps involved in an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and intraventricular biopsy procedure, initially by 3 independent neurosurgeons and subsequently by 12 participants of an intraventricular endoscopy workshop.\nAll 3 surgeons agreed on the ease and usefulness of these models in the teaching of endoscopic third ventriculostomy, performing endoscopic biopsies, and the integration of navigation to ventriculoscopy. Their overall score for the ventricular model realism was above average. The 12 participants of the intraventricular endoscopy workshop averaged between a score of 4.0 to 4.6 of 5 for every individual step of the procedure.\nNeurosurgical endoscopic training currently is a long process of stepwise training.

{"title": "Additively manufactured porous tantalum implants.", "abstract": "The medical device industry's interest in open porous, metallic biomaterials has increased in response to additive manufacturing techniques enabling the production of complex shapes that cannot be produced with conventional techniques. Tantalum is an important metal for medical devices because of its good biocompatibility. In this study selective laser melting technology was used for the first time to manufacture highly porous pure tantalum implants with fully interconnected open pores. The architecture of the porous structure in combination with the material properties of tantalum result in mechanical properties close to those of human bone and allow for bone ingrowth. The bone regeneration performance of the porous tantalum was evaluated in vivo using an orthotopic load-bearing bone defect model in the rat femur. After 12 weeks, substantial bone ingrowth, good quality of the regenerated bone and a strong, functional implant-bone interface connection were observed. Compared to identical porous Ti-6Al-4V structures, laser-melted tantalum shows excellent osteoconductive properties, has a higher normalized fatigue strength and allows for more plastic deformation due to its high ductility. It is therefore concluded that this is a first step towards a new generation of open porous tantalum implants manufactured using selective laser melting.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["RubenWauthle", "Johanvan der Stok", "SaberAmin Yavari", "JanVan Humbeeck", "Jean-PierreKruth", "Amir AbbasZadpoor", "HarrieWeinans", "MichielMulier", "JanSchrooten"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.003"}

Two aminosalicylate isomers used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine) and 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA), were selected as model drugs. Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments were loaded with the drugs in an ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.06% w/w and 0.25% w/w was achieved for the 5-ASA and 4-ASA strands, respectively. 10.5mm diameter tablets of both PVA/4-ASA and PVA/5-ASA were subsequently printed using an FDM 3D printer, and varying the weight and densities of the printed tablets was achieved by selecting the infill percentage in the printer software. The tablets were mechanically strong, and the FDM 3D printing was shown to be an effective process for the manufacture of the drug, 5-ASA. Significant thermal degradation of the active 4-ASA (50%) occurred during printing, however, indicating that the method may not be appropriate for drugs when printing at high temperatures exceeding those of the degradation point. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the formulated blends confirmed these findings while highlighting the potential of thermal analytical techniques to anticipate drug degradation issues in the 3D printing process. The results of the dissolution tests conducted in modified Hank's bicarbonate buffer showed that release profiles for both drugs were dependent on both the drug itself and on the infill percentage of the tablet.

The ultimate compressive strength of 55% porous green scaffolds printed along the Y-axis and dried in a vacuum oven for 6h was 0.88 \u00b1 0.02 MPa. Critically, the pores of 3D printed constructs could be user designed, ensuring bulk interconnectivity, and the imperfect packing of powder particles created an inherent surface roughness and non-designed porosity within the scaffold. These features are considered promising since they are known to facilitate osteoconduction and osteointegration in-vivo.

The attachment, stability of the monolayers on the SLM fabricated surface and functionalisation of SAMs with Paracetamol were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface wettability measurements. The obtained results confirmed that SAMs were stable on the Ti6Al4V surface for over four weeks and then began to desorb from the surface. The reaction used to functionalise the phosphonic acid monolayers with Paracetamol was noted to be successful.

However, the integration was poorly understood and commonly failed to meet the need of osteochondral scaffolds. In this paper, a biphasic polyethylene glycol (PEG)/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) scaffold with enhanced interfacial integration was developed. The chondral phase was a PEG hydrogel. The osseous phase was a \u03b2-TCP ceramic scaffold. The PEG hydrogel was directly cured on the ceramic interface layer by layer to fabricate osteochondral scaffolds by 3D printing technology. Meanwhile, a series of interface structure were designed with different interface pore area percentages (0/10/20/30/40/50/60%), and interfacial shear test was applied for interface structure optimization (n=6 samples/group). The interfacial shear strength of 30% pore area group was nearly three folds improved compared with that of 0% pore area percentage group, and more than fifty folds improved compared with that of traditional integration (5.91\u00b10.59 kPa).

The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using a fused deposition modelling (FDM) based 3D printer to fabricate extended release tablet using prednisolone loaded poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) filaments and to control its dose. Prednisolone was loaded into a PVA-based (1.75 mm) filament at approximately 1.9% w/w via incubation in a saturated methanolic solution of prednisolone. The physical form of the drug was assessed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Dose accuracy and in vitro drug release patterns were assessed using HPLC and pH change flow-through dissolution test. Prednisolone loaded PVA filament demonstrated an ability to be fabricated into regular ellipse-shaped solid tablets using the FDM-based 3D printer. It was possible to control the mass of printed tablet through manipulating the volume of the design (R(2) = 0.9983). On printing tablets with target drug contents of 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5 and 10mg, a good correlation between target and achieved dose was obtained (R(2) = 0.9904) with a dose accuracy range of 88.7-107%. Thermal analysis and XRPD indicated that the majority of prednisolone existed in amorphous form within the tablets. In vitro drug release from 3D printed tablets was extended up to 24h.

{"title": "Ornamenting 3D printed scaffolds with cell-laid extracellular matrix for bone tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "3D printing technique is the most sophisticated technique to produce scaffolds with tailorable physical properties. But, these scaffolds often suffer from limited biological functionality as they are typically made from synthetic materials. Cell-laid mineralized ECM was shown to be potential for improving the cellular responses and drive osteogenesis of stem cells. Here, we intend to improve the biological functionality of 3D-printed synthetic scaffolds by ornamenting them with cell-laid mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) that mimics a bony microenvironment. We developed bone graft substitutes by using 3D printed scaffolds made from a composite of polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) and mineralized ECM laid by human nasal inferior turbinate tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hTMSCs). A rotary flask bioreactor was used to culture hTMSCs on the scaffolds to foster formation of mineralized ECM. A freeze/thaw cycle in hypotonic buffer was used to efficiently decellularize (97% DNA reduction) the ECM-ornamented scaffolds while preserving its main organic and inorganic components. The ECM-ornamented 3D printed scaffolds supported osteoblastic differentiation of newly-seeded hTMSCs by upregulating four typical osteoblastic genes (4-fold higher RUNX2; 3-fold higher ALP; 4-fold higher osteocalcin; and 4-fold higher osteopontin) and increasing calcium deposition compared to bare 3D printed scaffolds. In vivo, in ectopic and orthotopic models in rats, ECM-ornamented scaffolds induced greater bone formation than that of bare scaffolds.

{"title": "Method for minimising rolling joint play in the steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex.", "abstract": "The steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex was recently developed with the vision of a minimalistic fully functional design, readily produced by additive manufacturing and requiring little assembly. Steering functionality is provided by rolling joints that, besides simplifying the assembly, help minimise cable fatigue and equalise force requirements on steering cables. However, the perfectly circular rolling joint design introduced some mechanism play, undermining the joint's bending stiffness. Hence, the aim of this paper is to present an innovative solution for play reduction in rolling joints.\nThe original play-compensating mechanism, a shaft-embedded compression spring, proved unsatisfactory for play reduction. Therefore, a new non-circular rolling joint curvature was designed with the objective to compensate for any cable slack and thus minimise the joint play. The new rolling joint design was evaluated in several tip deflection experiments and compared to the original one.\nThe experimental results proved that the optimised rolling joint curvature significantly minimises play, thus being a major improvement compared to the original design. The optimised rolling joint was implemented in a new real-scale DragonFlex prototype. The presented optimisation method enables elimination of a conventionally used cable tensioning device and it is generally applicable to steerable minimally invasive instruments that use a rolling joint.", "journal": "Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy", "date": "2014-11-20", "authors": ["FilipJel\u00ednek", "TomDiepens", "SanderDobbenga", "Geertvan der Jagt", "DaveyKreeft", "AnnemijnSmid", "RobPessers", "PaulBreedveld"], "doi": "10.3109/13645706.2014.968170"}
{"title": "Improved resolution of 3D printed scaffolds by shrinking.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing (3DP) uses inkjet printheads to selectively deposit liquid binder to adjoin powder particles in a layer-by-layer fashion to create a computer-modeled 3D object. Two general approaches for 3DP have been described for biomedical applications (direct and indirect 3DP). The two approaches offer competing advantages, and both are limited by print resolution. This study describes a materials processing strategy to enhance 3DP resolution by controlled shrinking net-shape scaffolds. Briefly, porogen preforms are printed and infused with the desired monomer or polymer solution. After solidification or polymerization, the porogen is leached and the polymer is allowed to shrink by controlled drying. Heat treatment is performed to retain the dimensions against swelling forces. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of polymer content and post-processing on dimension, microstructure, and thermomechanical properties of the scaffold. For polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA), reducing polymer content corresponded with greater shrinkage with maximum shrinkage of \u223c80 vol% at 20% vol% PEG-DA. The secondary heat treatment retains the microarchitecture and new dimensions of the scaffolds, even when the heat-treated scaffolds are immersed into water. To demonstrate shrinkage predictability, 3D components with interlocking positive and negative features were printed, processed, and fitted. This material processing strategy provides an alternative method to enhance the resolution of 3D scaffolds, for a wide range of polymers, without optimizing the binder-powder interaction physics to print each material combination.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The surgeons were given a list of key steps to achieve in exposing and drilling the skull base using the simulation model. They were then asked to list the level of difficulty of learning these steps using the model. The participants found the models suitable for learning registration, navigation and skull base drilling techniques.

{"title": "A versatile bioink for three-dimensional printing of cellular scaffolds based on thermally and photo-triggered tandem gelation.", "abstract": "Layer-by-layer bioprinting is a logical choice for the fabrication of stratified tissues like articular cartilage. Printing of viable organ replacements, however, is dependent on bioinks with appropriate rheological and cytocompatible properties. In cartilage engineering, photocrosslinkable glycosaminoglycan-based hydrogels are chondrogenic, but alone have generally poor printing properties. By blending the thermoresponsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) grafted hyaluronan (HA-pNIPAAM) with methacrylated hyaluronan (HAMA), high-resolution scaffolds with good viability were printed. HA-pNIPAAM provided fast gelation and immediate post-printing structural fidelity, while HAMA ensured long-term mechanical stability upon photocrosslinking. The bioink was evaluated for rheological properties, swelling behavior, printability and biocompatibility of encapsulated bovine chondrocytes. Elution of HA-pNIPAAM from the scaffold was necessary to obtain good viability. HA-pNIPAAM can therefore be used to support extrusion of a range of biopolymers which undergo tandem gelation, thereby facilitating the printing of cell-laden, stratified cartilage constructs with zonally varying composition and stiffness.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-09-28", "authors": ["MattiKesti", "MichaelM\u00fcller", "JanaBecher", "MatthiasSchnabelrauch", "MatteoD'Este", "DavidEglin", "MarcyZenobi-Wong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.033"}

However, progress in this field is currently extremely slow due to limited choices of bioink for cell encapsulation and cytocompatible gelation mechanisms. Here we report the development of clinically relevant sized tissue analogs by 3-D bioprinting, delivering human nasal inferior turbinate tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells encapsulated in silk fibroin-gelatin (SF-G) bioink. Gelation in this bioink was induced via in situ cytocompatible gelation mechanisms, namely enzymatic crosslinking by mushroom tyrosinase and physical crosslinking via sonication. Mechanistically, tyrosinases oxidize the accessible tyrosine residues of silk and/or gelatin into reactive o-quinone moieties that can either condense with each other or undergo nonenzymatic reactions with available amines of both silk and gelatin. Sonication alters the hydrophobic interaction and accelerates self-assembly of silk fibroin macromolecules to form \u03b2-sheet crystals, which physically crosslink the hydrogel. However, sonication has no effect on the conformation of gelatin. The effect of optimized rheology, secondary conformations of silk-gelatin bioink, temporally controllable gelation strategies and printing parameters were assessed to achieve maximum cell viability and multilineage differentiation of the encapsulated human nasal inferior turbinate tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells.

We hypothesize that besides good printability and cytocompatibility of a supporting hydrogel for the manufacture of individual tissues, it is equally essential to consider beforehand the desired tissue (bone, cartilage, fat). In light of its application, the structure and stiffness of printable hydrogel matrices influence cell geometry, which in turn impacts the differentiation fate. Embedded human mesenchymal stromal cells in printable type I collagen- and chitosan-agarose blends were induced to differentiate toward osteoblasts and adipocytes. Hydrogels' printability in air versus submerged printing in perfluorocarbon was evaluated according to the height, diameter, uniformity, and stability of 3D printed vertical cylinders. Bipotent differentiation within hydrogels was assessed histologically (morphology, cellularity), by immunohistochemistry (vimentin, smooth muscle actin), two-photon microscopy (spatial distribution), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (ALP, BGLAP, OPN, RUNX2, COL 1, aP2, PPAR\u03b3-2). Agarose and agarose blends revealed the most valid printability properties by generating uniform cylinders with an average height of 4\u2009mm. Osteogenic differentiation was preferably achieved in anisotropic soft collagen-rich substrates, whereas adipogenic differentiation mostly occurred in isotropic stiff agarose-rich matrices.

We developed a titanium template that fits exactly to the surfaces of the proximal and distal scaphoid poles to define their position relative to each other after resection of the non-union. The templates were designed on three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions and manufactured using selective laser melting technology. Ten conserved human wrists were used to simulate the reconstruction.

However, it is still very challenging to cure the osteochondral defects due to their poor inherent regenerative capacity, complex stratified architecture, and disparate biomechanical properties. The objective of this study is to create novel three-dimensional (3D) printed osteochondral scaffolds with both excellent interfacial mechanical properties and biocompatibility for facilitating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) growth and chondrogenic differentiation. For this purpose, we designed and 3D printed a series of innovative bi-phasic 3D models that mimic the osteochondral region of articulate joints. Our mechanical testing results showed that our bi-phasic scaffolds with key structures have enhanced mechanical characteristics in compression (a maximum Young's modulus of 31\u2009MPa) and shear (a maximum fracture strength of 5768\u2009N/mm(2)) when compared with homogenous designs. These results are also correlated with numerical simulation. In order to improve their biocompatibility, the scaffolds' surfaces were further modified with acetylated collagen (one of the main components in osteochondral extracellular matrix). MSC proliferation results demonstrated that incorporation of a collagen, along with biomimetically designed micro-features, can greatly enhance MSC growth after 5 days in vitro. Two weeks' chondrogenic differentiation results showed that our novel scaffolds (dubbed \"key\" scaffolds), both with and without surface collagen modification, displayed enhanced chondrogenesis (e.g., 130%, 114%, and 236% increases in glycosaminoglycan, type II collagen deposition, and total protein content on collagen-modified key scaffolds when compared with homogeneous controls).", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

For this purpose, we fabricated 3D-printed chip that was suitable for bacterial cultivation, DNA isolation, PCR, and detection of amplified gene using gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probes as an indicator of MRSA. Confirmation of the MRSA presence in the samples was based on a specific interaction between mecA gene with the AuNP probes and a colorimetric detection, which utilized the noncross-linking aggregation phenomenon of DNA-functionalized AuNPs. To test the whole system, we analyzed several real refractive indexes, in which two of them were positively scanned to find the presence of mecA gene.

In this report, we present a case in which a reproducible method for producing a 3D-printed \"reverse model\" representing a skin wound defect was used for flap design and harvesting. This comprised a 82-year-old man with an exposed ankle prosthesis after serial soft tissue debridements for wound infection. Soft tissue coverage and dead-space filling were planned with a composite radial forearm free flap (RFFF). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the donor site (left forearm), recipient site (right ankle), and the left ankle was performed. 2D data from the CTA was 3D-reconstructed using computer software, with a 3D image of the left ankle used as a \"control.\" A 3D model was created by superimposing the left and right ankle images, to create a \"reverse image\" of the defect, and printed using a 3D printer. The RFFF was thus planned and executed effectively, without complication.

In conclusion, we present an innovative cell-printed scaffold for cartilage regeneration fabricated by an advanced bioprinting technology.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2013-01-26", "authors": ["JoydipKundu", "Jin-HyungShim", "JinahJang", "Sung-WonKim", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1682"}
{"title": "Biofabrication of a PLGA-TCP-based porous bioactive bone substitute with sustained release of icaritin.", "abstract": "A phytomolecule, icaritin, has been identified and shown to be osteopromotive for the prevention of osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. This study aimed to produce a bioactive poly (l-lactide-co-glycolide)-tricalcium phosphate (PLGA-TCP)-based porous scaffold incorporating the osteopromotive phytomolecule icaritin, using a fine spinning technology. Both the structure and the composition of icaritin-releasing PLGA-TCP-based scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity was quantified by both water absorption and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The mechanical properties were evaluated using a compression test. In vitro release of icaritin from the PLGA-TCP scaffold was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the composite scaffold were evaluated. Both an in vitro cytotoxicity test and an in vivo test via muscular implantation were conducted to confirm the scaffold's biocompatibility. The results showed that the PLGA-TCP-icaritin composite scaffold was porous, with interconnected macro- (about 480\u2009\u00b5m) and micropores (2-15\u2009\u00b5m). The mechanical properties of the PLGA-TCP-icaritin scaffold were comparable with those of the pure PLGA-TCP scaffold, yet was spinning direction-dependent. Icaritin content was detected in the medium and increased with time. The PLGA-TCP-icaritin scaffold facilitated the attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vitro cytotoxicity test and in vivo intramuscular implantation showed that the composite scaffold had no toxicity with good biocompatibility. In conclusion, an osteopromotive phytomolecule, icaritin, was successfully incorporated into PLGA-TCP to form an innovative porous composite scaffold with sustained release of osteopromotive icaritin, and this scaffold had good biocompatibility and osteopromotion, suggesting its potential for orthopaedic applications.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-12-21", "authors": ["Xin-HuiXie", "Xin-LuanWang", "GeZhang", "Yi-XinHe", "YangLeng", "Ting-TingTang", "XiaohuaPan", "LingQin"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1679"}
{"title": "Additive manufacturing techniques for the production of tissue engineering constructs.", "abstract": "'Additive manufacturing' (AM) refers to a class of manufacturing processes based on the building of a solid object from three-dimensional (3D) model data by joining materials, usually layer upon layer. Among the vast array of techniques developed for the production of tissue-engineering (TE) scaffolds, AM techniques are gaining great interest for their suitability in achieving complex shapes and microstructures with a high degree of automation, good accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, the possibility of rapidly producing tissue-engineered constructs meeting patient's specific requirements, in terms of tissue defect size and geometry as well as autologous biological features, makes them a powerful way of enhancing clinical routine procedures. This paper gives an extensive overview of different AM techniques classes (i.e. stereolithography, selective laser sintering, 3D printing, melt-extrusion-based techniques, solution/slurry extrusion-based techniques, and tissue and organ printing) employed for the development of tissue-engineered constructs made of different materials (i.e. polymeric, ceramic and composite, alone or in combination with bioactive agents), by highlighting their principles and technological solutions.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-11-23", "authors": ["CarlosMota", "DarioPuppi", "FedericaChiellini", "EmoChiellini"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1635"}
{"title": "Cartilage regeneration using zonal chondrocyte subpopulations: a promising approach or an overcomplicated strategy?", "abstract": "Cartilage defects heal imperfectly and osteoarthritic changes develop frequently as a result. Although the existence of specific behaviours of chondrocytes derived from various depth-related zones in vitro has been known for over 20\u2009years, only a relatively small body of in vitro studies has been performed with zonal chondrocytes and current clinical treatment strategies do not reflect these native depth-dependent (zonal) differences. This is surprising since mimicking the zonal organization of articular cartilage in neo-tissue by the use of zonal chondrocyte subpopulations could enhance the functionality of the graft. Although some research groups including our own have made considerable progress in tailoring culture conditions using specific growth factors and biomechanical loading protocols, we conclude that an optimal regime has not yet been determined. Other unmet challenges include the lack of specific zonal cell sorting protocols and limited amounts of cells harvested per zone. As a result, the engineering of functional tissue has not yet been realized and no long-term in vivo studies using zonal chondrocytes have been described. This paper critically reviews the research performed to date and outlines our view of the potential future significance of zonal chondrocyte populations in regenerative approaches for the treatment of cartilage defects. Secondly, we briefly discuss the capabilities of additive manufacturing technologies that can not only create patient-specific grafts directly from medical imaging data sets but could also more accurately reproduce the complex 3D zonal extracellular matrix architecture using techniques such as hydrogel-based cell printing.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-11-09", "authors": ["WSchuurman", "T JKlein", "W J ADhert", "P Rvan Weeren", "D WHutmacher", "JMalda"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1638"}
