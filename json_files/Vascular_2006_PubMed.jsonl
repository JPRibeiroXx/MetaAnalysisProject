{"title": "In vitro reconstruction of a tissue-engineered endothelialized bladder from a single porcine biopsy.", "abstract": "Augmentation of the urinary bladder using a tissue-engineered approach with autologous cells is a very promising technique. To prevent risks of necrosis after transplantation, the graft vascularization process could be markedly enhanced by incorporation of autologous endothelial cells in the tissue-engineered organ. The purpose of this study was to develop a separation technique to extract four bladder cell types from the same biopsy, and to prepare an endothelialized reconstructed bladder.\nFibroblasts, smooth muscle cells (SMC), urothelial cells (UC) and endothelial cells (EC) were extracted from a small porcine bladder biopsy. The SMC, fibroblasts and EC were seeded on the top of the sponge and cultured for 10 days. Then, the UC were seeded on top of these cells for 15 additional days to produce a three-dimensional bladder wall.\nThe UC and EC extracts from a single porcine biopsy were 97.2+/-0.6% keratin 8/18-positive and 97.7+/-0.3% PECAM-1-positive pure cells, respectively, as assessed by flow cytometry. The SMC could not be dissociated from fibroblasts, and were present as 37+/-0.5% desmin-positive cells. UC differentiated into a urothelium characterized by umbrella cells and a laminin-positive basal membrane. The EC reorganized in the matrix to form PECAM-1-positive capillary-like tubes.\nThis new model of tissue-engineered bladder has the main advantages of being at least 2mm thick, autologous, and able to promote the formation of capillary-like tubes. It could be a promising alternative to the use of gastrointestinal segments to improve bladder capacity.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric urology", "date": "2008-10-25", "authors": ["MartineMagnan", "Fran\u00e7oisBerthod", "Marie-FranceChampigny", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricSoucy", "St\u00e9phaneBolduc"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jpurol.2005.11.019"}

At CT assisted myelography, an entirely extradurally situated meningioma was detected and totally removed. Two years later increasing right-sided exophthalmos, without visual impairment was observed. The CT scan revealed thickening and abnormal shape of the sphenoid and the bony structures of the orbit. The retrobulbar space was narrowed and the optic nerve was shifted. At operation, ala parva of the sphenoid bone, the roof and the lateral orbital wall appeared thickened, laminated, fragile and exceedingly vascularized. The subdural space was found intact. The histopathological study revealed primary intraosseous meningioma of the sphenoid. There was no family history for neurofibromatosis (NF). The clinical findings at this time could not fulfil the criteria for NF2 and the case was considered as \"true\" multiple meningiomas occurring in different compartments of the neuraxis.

The first is how to harvest, handle, and multiply them non-invasively, easily, and effectively. From this standpoint, adipose-derived stem cells are considered to be the best to work with among mesenchymal stem cells; since they were first reported in 2001, their pluripotency, proliferative efficiency, and low donor morbidity have been amply confirmed. The second factor is how to differentiate stem cells into the required cells and use them effectively to construct three-dimensional tissues; here, tissue-specific scaffolds and signaling systems are essential. The third factor is how to ensure survival of the differentiated cells and regenerated tissues. Regenerated tissues need to contain vascular systems to allow both the tissues themselves and the differentiated cells to survive. Thus, we believe that the vascularization of regenerated tissues will be an important field of research in the near future.

The SFCS repair sites remained intact, and their mechanical strength was similar to that of the native abdominal wall despite greater degradation and remodeling of SFCS than of HADM. The deposition of new extracellular matrix consisting of collagen and ground substance, uniform vascularization, and cellular infiltration in SFCS repair sites contributed to the increase in mechanical strength of the regenerated tissue.

In the context of tissue engineering, one potential solution to the diffusion limitation is to create a vascular network in vitro that can subsequently anastomose with the host after implantation, allowing the implantation of thicker, more complex tissues. In this study, the ability of endothelial cells to sprout and form stable vascular networks in 3-dimensional (3D) fibrin matrices was investigated as a function of matrix density in a prevascularized tissue model. The results demonstrate that while increasing matrix density leads to a nearly 7-fold increase in compressive stiffness, vascular sprouting is virtually eliminated in the most dense matrix condition. However, the addition of human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) to the denser matrices reverses this effect, resulting in an up to a 7-fold increase in network formation. Although the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP are all upregulated early on with the addition of HMSCs, MT1-MMP appears to play a particularly important role in the observed angiogenic response among these proteases.

The increasing disparity between the demand and availability of adequate substitutes for small-diameter human blood vessels has prompted an intensive search for artificial materials or biological allograft tissues, both of which usually fail in the long term. The objective of this study was to pioneer a novel model for in vivo guided angiogenesis based on a specific design process of a filamentous polymeric scaffold with endothelial cells in a 3-dimensional culture system. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an in vivo guided angiogenesis approach based on a 2-step model, composed of endothelial cells and a filamentous polymeric scaffold framework. Endothelial cells that had been cultured on a specifically designed filamentous polymeric scaffold within a regulated dynamic tissue culture system were shown in vivo to induce guided angiogenesis. Cells seeded on a biodegradable polymeric scaffold were implanted into mice. On day 28 after implantation, analysis revealed a guided angiogenic process along the path of the implanted polymeric scaffold as well as initial evidence for early maturation of engineered vessels, allowing red blood cells to flow through the forming lumina of new vessels as the polymer degraded.

The current need for tissue replacements has necessitated the development of a new science termed 'bone tissue engineering'. The basic organization of bone tissue requires the design and fabrication of a porous 3D structure or 'scaffold' to contain the bone-forming cells. This scaffold should be formulated from biocompatible, osteoconductive materials that are not immunoreactive. 3D scaffolds provide the necessary support for cells to proliferate and maintain their capacity to differentiate and scaffolds containing bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitors can be employed within implants to enhance bone repair. The complex construct is intended to mimic the native in vivo microenvironment and this demands construction of bioactive scaffolds that are also capable of supporting vascularization as well as cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. 3D bioactive scaffolds containing committed osteoprogenitors can provide a promising surgical tool for bone tissue engineering directed at orthopedic and cranio-maxillofacial clinical applications.", "journal": "Regenerative medicine", "date": "2007-05-01", "authors": ["SamerSrouji", "TaliKizhner", "ErellaLivne"], "doi": "10.2217/17460751.1.4.519"}

{"title": "To give or not to give recombinant EPO to anemia endangered cancer patients.", "abstract": "EPO is known as an inducer of maturation and proliferation of erythrocytes. Moreover, it favours angiogenesis. In several studies it was encountered that EPO is a trophic agent that mediates survival and inhibits apoptosis of hypoxia affected cells, particularly those which build masses of irregularly vascularized cancers. The main task concerning EPO for oncologists is the choice to give or not to give recombinant EPO to anemia endangered cancer patients. EPO can do the quality of life better and cause recovery from anemia post chemotherapy and radiation of cancer patients. Nevertheless, EPO therapy shortens survival of patients in some cancers, in which antiapoptotic effect of EPO predominates directly in malignant cells. Thus, separately in every type of cancer, therapeutic use of recombinant EPO calls for prior investigations, if EPO signaling causes proliferation of cancer cells by direct stimulation of EPOR positive malignant cells. Unless the proliferative effect of EPO on cancer cells is excluded, its use in the therapy of anemia in cancer patients is not quite safe.", "journal": "Prague medical report", "date": "2007-03-28", "authors": ["MSulkowska", "AWincewicz", "AChabowska", "LKanczuga-Koda", "MSzymanska", "MKoda", "EWitkowska", "SSulkowski"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of vascular permeability and extracellular volume fraction of breast tumors by dynamic Gd-DTPA-enhanced relaxometry.", "abstract": "Vascular permeability (k(ep), min(-1)) and extracellular volume fraction (v(e)) are tissue parameters of great interest to characterize malignant tumor lesions. Indeed, it is well known that tumors with high blood supply better respond to therapy than poorly vascularized tumors, and tumors with large extracellular volume tend to be more malignant than tumors showing lower extracellular volume. Furthermore, the transport of therapeutic agents depends on both extracellular volume fraction and vessel permeability. Thus, before treatment, these tissue parameters may prove useful to evaluate tumor aggressiveness and to predict responsiveness to therapy and variations during cytotoxic therapies could allow to assess treatment efficacy and early modified therapy schedules in case of poor responsiveness. As a consequence, there is a need to develop methods that could be routinely used to determine these tissue parameters. In this work, blood-tissue permeability and extracellular volume fraction information were derived from magnetic resonance imaging dynamic longitudinal relaxation rate (R(1)) mapping obtained after an intravenous bolus injection of Gd-DTPA in a group of 92 female patients with breast lesions, 68 of these being histologically proven to be with carcinoma. For the sake of comparison, 24 benign lesions were studied. The measurement protocol based on two-dimensional gradient echo sequences and a monoexponential plasma kinetic model was that validated in the occasion of previous animal experiments. As a consequence of neoangiogenesis, results showed a higher permeability in malignant than in benign lesions, whereas the extracellular volume fraction value did not allow any discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. The method, which can be easily implemented whatever the imaging system used, could advantageously be used to quantify lesion parameters (k(ep) and v(e)) in routine clinical imaging.

SD rats were divided into 4 groups: the rats were treated by 0.9 % NS (n=24, control group), inosine+vitamin C (n=40, InV group), Danshen (n=40, DS group) and 5-FU (n=40, 5-FU group), respectively. The liver function, morphological changes and the expressions of PCNA, VEGF and ICAM-1 in carcinoma foci, peri-carcinoma tissues, adjacent lobe (left-internal lobe) and lung tissues were observed after the treatment with the 4 agents. Our results showed that the protective effect of Danshen on liver function was significantly better than that of NS and 5-FU (P<0.01). No significant difference in protective effect was observed between DS group and InV group (P>0.05). Danshen also provided protective effect on the morphological damage of liver caused by obstructive jaundice.

{"title": "The role of the electron transport SDHC gene on lifespan and cancer.", "abstract": "Much attention has been focused on the hypothesis that oxidative damage plays in cellular and organismal aging. It is known that oxygen is initially converted to superoxide anion (O2-), one of reactive oxygen species (ROS), by electron leaked from mainly complex III in the electron transport system present in mitochondria, where it is the major endogenous source of ROS. We have shown that a mutation in a subunit, cytochrome b large subunit (SDHC), of complex II, also results in increasing O2- production and therefore lead to apoptosis and precocious aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recently, individuals with an inherited propensity for vascularized head and neck tumors (i.e., paragangliomas) have been demonstrated to contain one of several mutations in complex II. To further explore the role of oxidative stress from mitochondria on apoptosis and cancer, we established a transgenic cell line with a point mutation at the ubiquinone binding region in the SDHC gene. As expected, this mutation increased O2- production from complex II and led to excess apoptosis. Moreover, a significant fraction of the surviving cells from the apoptosis were transformed, as evidenced by increased tumor formation after injection into mice. Oxidative stress results in the damage to the cellular components including mitochondria and, therefore leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress must cause mutations in DNA and leads to cancer.

It may involve the pleura, less frequently the peritoneum rarely, the pericardium, the tunica vaginalis testis and ovarian epithelium. Asbestos has been widely used in industry. A causal relationship between asbestos exposure and pleural, peritoneal and pericardial malign mesothelioma was suggested, the risk of cancer being correlated to cumulate exposure. Studies from National Cancer Institute, USA, show that the malignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive asbestos related malignancy. The symptomatology is insidious and poses difficult problems in diagnosis and treatment.

The reconstruction of defects resulting from radical excisions, trauma, or hereditary diseases has seen the use of combined grafts and flaps. With the aim of minimizing donor site morbidity, new methods have been evaluated. Because of a low rate of vascularization, with artificial dermal templates the take has only been poor. As shown in previous studies, improved angiogenetic potency and epidermal formation has been obtained in modified, cell-seeded collagen matrices. We have now investigated the suitability of adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) for soft tissue engineering. In this study, hMSC were isolated and expanded. Cells (10(6)) were seeded onto EDC cross-linked collagen sponges and implanted in 30 immunodeficient mice. Collagen sponges without cells were used as controls. The grafts were evaluated after 2 and 6 weeks. After explantation, macroscopic appearance, weights, and histology (scaffold degradation, cellularity, and invasion depth of the seeded cells) were all assessed. After 2 and 6 weeks in vivo, new vessels were found macroscopically on all cell-seeded collagen grafts. The control grafts appeared to be degraded with a lower rate of vessel ingrowth. In the experimental group, weight gain was significant after 2 and 6 weeks in vivo compared to the same grafts after 72 h in vitro, while weight increased only slightly in the control group. Histologically, populated scaffolds showed a high density of vascularization under a capsule. The control sponges showed single capillaries and a thicker capsule. Compared to the controls, cellularity (cells/field) was greater in cell-containing collagen grafts after 2 and 6 weeks.

Exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used for both sterilization and bleaching of bone, the latter primarily for cosmetic reasons. We investigated the effect of H2O2, on the osteoinductive capacity of DBM. Cortical bone implants prepared from rat femurs were placed into 3% H2O2 solution. Control specimens were not exposed to H2O2. Bones were then lipid-extracted, demineralized, sterilized with ethylene oxide, and freeze-dried in an identical manner. Allografts were implanted into rat hosts for 1 to 3 weeks. Osteoinduction proceeded rapidly in implants not exposed to H2O2, with chondrocytes and new bone appearing in the implant. After 3 weeks, perforations in the implant were largely replaced with new bone. In contrast, osteoinduction did not occur in implants treated with H2O2. Perforations in H2O2-treated implants were filled with vascularized fibrous tissue, but no cartilage or bone. These findings reveal that H2O2 used for disinfection or bleaching of DBM can abolish its osteoinductive capacity in rats.", "journal": "American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)", "date": "2007-01-25", "authors": ["Ellen MCarpenter", "ElGendler", "Theodore IMalinin", "H ThomasTemple"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Enhanced dermal regeneration using modified collagen scaffolds: experimental porcine study.", "abstract": "Ongoing research has achieved much progress towards the development of new artificial skin substitute products. However, effective implant material for correcting full-thickness defects (such as those arising from extensive burns, tumor resection, hereditary or congenital defects and chronic wounds) has not yet become available. Following split-thickness skin grafting, contraction and scar formation are unavoidable. These phenomena are believed to be due to poor dermis regeneration. Collagen dermis substitute has been developed for the treatment of deep, poorly vascularized tissue defects. However, their application is problematic, because scaffolds of this kind fail to adequately induce the neoangiogenesis needed for regeneration. To overcome these shortcomings a number of matrices have been chemically modified. Furthermore, these matrices first require implantation and follow-up by skin grafting 3 to 5 weeks later. In this article we describe new materials made of modified collagen which enhance dermal regeneration and neoangiogenesis. The procedure was applied in successfully dealing with full-thickness defects in pigs, with subsequent split-thickness skin grafting being performed immediately afterwards. Histological findings revealed that the neodermis obtained resembles a normal dermis structure.

Here, we investigated whether this subfertility is due to a defect in the ovary itself or to more general endocrine changes in ERbeta-/- mice. We transplanted ERbeta-/- ovaries into WT mice and WT ovaries into ERbeta-/- mice. Upon mating with ERbeta-/- males, fertility increased from 20% in control intact ERbeta-/- group to 40% in the WT recipients with ERbeta-/- ovaries. The transplantation procedure was not efficient, and when WT ovaries were transplanted into WT mice, fertility was only 36%. Surgical ovarian wedge resection, a procedure which induces ovulation in anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, resulted in 100% fertility of ERbeta-/- mice. In ERbeta-/- mice, as the follicles enlarged, the thecal layer remained very compact (revealed by H&E and collagen staining), and there was no increase in vascularization (measured as smooth muscle actin). In addition, there was an increase in PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and a decrease in PDGFbeta expression in the granulosa cells, similar to what has been found in follitropin receptor knockout mice. After wedge resection, expression of both smooth muscle actin and PDGFRs was normalized. During normal follicular development, increased vascularization of the thecal layer is a prerequisite for further follicular growth. We suggest that the defect in ERbeta-/- mouse ovaries is a failure of communication between the granulosa and thecal layers. The follicles do not mature because of insufficient blood supply.

To test this hypothesis, we silenced MTf in human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and examined the plasmin activity and invasiveness of MTf-silenced melanoma. In vitro, the siRNA-mediated MTf knockdown inhibited by 58% the cell surface activation of plasminogen into plasmin. In addition, decreased expression of MTf in melanoma cells reduced cell migration. In vivo, we used a nude mice invasion model in which tissue factor (TF) induces vascular [125I]-fibrin deposition following injection. Using this metastasis model, the invasive potential of MTf-silenced cells into the lungs was reduced by fivefold. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that MTf overexpression in melanoma cells contributes to tumor progression by stimulating plasmin generation as well as cell migration and invasion.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2007-01-02", "authors": ["YanickBertrand", "MichelDemeule", "JonathanMichaud-Levesque", "RichardB\u00e9liveau"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.034"}

Bisphosphonates are prescribed for the treatment of malignant hypercalcemia, osteolysis associated with metastatic bone disease, Paget's disease and osteoporosis. Maxillomandibular osteonecrosis with bisphosphonates can be observed in 1/10000 patients, but is probably underestimated due to lack of dental examination.\nWe describe six cases of mandibular necrosis associated with bisphosphonates: five of them as part of their treatment regimen for a neoplastic condition and one for osteoporosis.\nTwo patients developed spontaneous bone necrosis. In two others, tooth extraction preceded the onset of osteonecrosis. In the last two patients, we noted a preexisting dental infection. All the histopathological examinations showed necrotic bone colonized by Actinomyces.\nBisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis is only found in the maxillomandibular area because the jaws are the only bone in the skeleton exposed to the external environment.

{"title": "Relationship between angiogenesis and inflammation in experimental arthritis.", "abstract": "Background. Angiogenesis is involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leading to leucocyte recruitment and inflammation in the synovium. Furthermore, synovial inflammation itself further potentiates endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the reciprocical relationship between synovial inflammation and angiogenesis in a RA model, namely collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods. CIA was induced by immunization of DBA/1 mice with collagen type II in adjuvant. Endothelial cells were detected using a GSL-1 lectin-specific immunohistochemical staining on knee joint sections. Angiogenesis, clinical scores and histological signs of arthritis were evaluated from the induction of CIA until the end of the experiment. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting both the isolated endothelial cells and vessels stained on each section. To evaluate the effect of increased angiogenesis on CIA, VEGF gene transfer was performed using an adeno-associated virus encoding VEGF (AAV-VEGF), by intra-muscular or intra-articular injection in mice with CIA. Results. We showed an increase in synovial angiogenesis from day 6 to day 55 after CIA induction, and, moreover, joint vascularization and clinical scores of arthritis were correlated (p < 0.0001, r = 0.61). Vascularization and histological scores were also correlated (p = 0.0006, r = 0.51). Systemic VEGF overexpression in mice with CIA was followed by an aggravation of arthritis as compared to AAV-lacZ control group (p < 0.0001). In contrast, there was no difference in clinical scores between control mice and mice injected within the knee with AAV-VEGF, even if joint vascularization was higher in this group than in all other groups (p = 0,05 versus non-injected group). Intra-articular AAV-VEGF injections induced more severe signs of histological inflammation and bone destruction than AAV-Lac Z or no injection. Conclusion. Angiogenesis and joint inflammation evolve in parallel during collagen-induced arthritis. Furthermore, this work shows that exogenous VEGF can aggravate CIA. It is direct evidence that the increase in joint vascularization leads to an exacerbation of arthritis. Taken together, these results emphasize the role of angiogenesis in inflammatory arthritis. It also suggests an early involvement of angiogenesis in joint inflammation.", "journal": "European cytokine network", "date": "2006-12-30", "authors": ["GaelleClavel", "ChiaraValvason", "KunioYamaoka", "DelphineLemeiter", "LilianeLaroche", "Marie-ChristopheBoissier", "NatachaBessis"], "doi": null}

Both statin (S) and resveratrol (R) demonstrated cardioprotection through nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine whether combination therapy with statin and resveratrol is more cardioprotective than individual treatment groups in ischemic rat heart model. The rats were fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and after 8 weeks of high cholesterol diet the animals were treated with statin (1 mg/kg bw/day) and resveratrol (20 mg/kg bw/day) for 2 weeks. The rats were assigned to: (1) Control (C), (2) HC, (3) HCR, (4) HCS and (5) HCRS. The hearts, subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion were used as experimental model. The left ventricular functional recovery (+dp/dt(max)) was found to be significantly better in the HCRS (1926+/-43), HCR (1556+/-65) and HCS (1635+/-40) compared to HC group (1127+/-16). The infarct sizes in the HCRS, HCS and HCR groups were 37+/-3.6, 43+/-3.3 and 44+/-4.2 respectively compared to 53+/-4.6 in HC. The lipid level was found to be decreased in all the treatment groups when compared to HC more significantly in HCS and HCRS groups when compared to HCR. Increased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS was also observed in all the treatment groups resulting in decreased extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis but the extent of reduction in apoptosis was more significant in HCRS group compared to all other groups. In vivo rat myocardial infarction (MI) model subjected to 1 week of permanent left descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion documented increased capillary density in HCR and HCRS treated group when compared to HCS treatment group. We also documented increased beta-catenin translocation and increased VEGF mRNA expression in all treatment groups. Thus, we conclude that the acute as well as chronic protection afforded by combination treatment with statin and resveratrol may be due to pro-angiogenic, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-apoptotic effects and long-term effects may be caused by increased neo-vascularization of the MI zone leading to less ventricular remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2006-12-26", "authors": ["Suresh VarmaPenumathsa", "MaheshThirunavukkarasu", "SrikanthKoneru", "BelaJuhasz", "LijunZhan", "RimaPant", "Venugopal PMenon", "HajimeOtani", "NilanjanaMaulik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.10.018"}
{"title": "Angiogenic factors stimulate tubular branching morphogenesis of sonic hedgehog-deficient lungs.", "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-deficient mice have a severe lung branching defect. Recent studies have shown that hedgehog signaling is involved in vascular development and it is possible that the diminished airway branching in Shh-deficient mice is due to abnormal pulmonary vasculature formation. Therefore, we investigated the role of Shh in pulmonary vascular development using Shh/Tie2lacZ compound mice, which exhibit endothelial cell-specific LacZ expression, and Pecam-1 immunohistochemistry. In E11.5-13.5 Shh-deficient mice, the pulmonary vascular bed is decreased, but appropriate to the decrease in airway branching. However, when E12.5 Shh-deficient lungs were cultured for 4-6 days, the vascular network deteriorated compared to wild-type lungs. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) or its receptor Vegfr2 (KDR/Flk-1) was not different between E12.5-13.5 Shh-deficient and wild-type lungs. In contrast, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), but not Ang2 or the angiopoietin receptor Tie2, mRNA expression was downregulated in E12.5-E13.5 lungs of Shh null mutants. Recombinant Ang1 alone was unable to restore in vitro branching morphogenesis in Shh-deficient lungs. Conversely, the angiogenic factor fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-2 alone or in combination with Ang1, increased vascularization and tubular growth and branching of Shh-deficient lungs in vitro. The angiogenic factors did not overcome the reduced smooth muscle cell differentiation in the Shh null lungs. These data indicate that early vascular development, mediated by Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling proceeds normally in Shh-deficient mice, while later vascular development and stabilization of the primitive network mediated by the Ang/Tie2 signaling pathway are defective, resulting in an abnormal vascular network. Stimulation of vascularization with angiogenic factors such as Fgf2 and Ang1 partially restored tubular growth and branching in Shh-deficient lungs, suggesting that vascularization is required for branching morphogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-12-26", "authors": ["Minkevan Tuyl", "FreekGroenman", "JinxiaWang", "MaciekKuliszewski", "JasonLiu", "DickTibboel", "MartinPost"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.11.029"}

It has a complex architecture, and distinct geographic regions within the ligament have different functional roles depending on the angle and loading conditions. Collagen type I is the main component of the extracellular matrix; the fibrils have a crimped structure. The cruciate ligaments are almost completely covered by synovium, protecting them from synovial fluid. Cruciate blood supply is mainly of soft tissue origin. The intraligamentous network is relatively limited whereas the core of the middle third of the CCL is even less well vascularized. Neurohistologic studies are very limited in the dog. Various mechanoreceptors and proprioceptive receptors have been identified within the substance of the cruciate ligaments.\nCCL structural characteristics play an important part in its complex behaviour with the crimped pattern of the collagen fibrils being an important determinant of its biomechanical properties. In contrast to reports of managing CCL rupture, there are few reports describing the microanatomy and neurovascular morphology of the cruciate ligaments.\nCruciate disease is likely multi-factorial. Improved understanding of CCL degradation leading to CCL rupture is critical to development of new diagnostic tests for cruciate disease in dogs. Appropriate intervention during the early stages of disease process might preserve CCL structural properties by preventing further collagen degradation. Accurate knowledge of functional and fiber bundle anatomy is imperative for reconstruction and restoration of normal stifle joint physiology. Reconstructive goals should alleviate existing instability and mimic normal kinematics.

Neutralizing Dll4 with a Dll4-selective antibody rendered endothelial cells hyperproliferative, and caused defective cell fate specification or differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, blocking Dll4 inhibited tumour growth in several tumour models. Remarkably, antibodies against Dll4 and antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) had paradoxically distinct effects on tumour vasculature. Our data also indicate that Dll4-mediated Notch signalling is crucial during active vascularization, but less important for normal vessel maintenance. Furthermore, unlike blocking Notch signalling globally, neutralizing Dll4 had no discernable impact on intestinal goblet cell differentiation, supporting the idea that Dll4-mediated Notch signalling is largely restricted to the vascular compartment.

{"title": "Preconditioning of the tumor vasculature and tumor cells by intermittent hypoxia: implications for anticancer therapies.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common feature in tumors associated with an increased resistance of tumor cells to therapies. In addition to O(2) diffusion-limited hypoxia, another form of tumor hypoxia characterized by fluctuating changes in pO(2) within the disorganized tumor vascular network is described. Here, we postulated that this form of intermittent hypoxia promotes endothelial cell survival, thereby extending the concept of hypoxia-driven resistance to the tumor vasculature. We found that endothelial cell exposure to cycles of hypoxia reoxygenation not only rendered them resistant to proapoptotic stresses, including serum deprivation and radiotherapy, but also increased their capacity to migrate and organize in tubes. By contrast, prolonged hypoxia failed to exert protective effects and even seemed deleterious when combined with radiotherapy. The use of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha)-targeting small interfering RNA led us to document that the accumulation of HIF-1alpha during intermittent hypoxia accounted for the higher resistance of endothelial cells. We also used an in vivo approach to enforce intermittent hypoxia in tumor-bearing mice and found that it was associated with less radiation-induced apoptosis within both the vascular and the tumor cell compartments (versus normoxia or prolonged hypoxia). Radioresistance was further ascertained by an increased rate of tumor regrowth in irradiated mice preexposed to intermittent hypoxia and confirmed in vitro using distinctly radiosensitive tumor cell lines. In conclusion, we have documented that intermittent hypoxia may condition endothelial cells and tumor cells in such a way that they are more resistant to apoptosis and more prone to participate in tumor progression.

Hyperlipidemic patients show alterations in ocular vascularization. However, it is not known whether these alterations are reversible after the lipid profile returns to normal. This study evaluates a rabbit model of hypercholesterolemia, examining the ultrastructural changes in the choroid, and the changes in it after a period of normal blood-cholesterol values induced by a standard diet. Rabbits were divided into three groups: G0, fed a standard diet; G1A, fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months; and G1B, fed a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet for 8 months followed by a standard diet for a further 6 months. Eyes were processed for transmission electron microscopy. G1A had a buildup of lipids at the suprachoroidea that compressed the vascular layers, and hypertrophy of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. In G1B there was less lipid accumulation than in G1A, but this was not followed by reversal of the choroidal damage. The suprachoroidea thickness of G1B was still greater than in G0 due to abundant collagen fibers. The intervascular spaces of the choroid had fewer lipids than G1A but more collagen fibers than G0. The large- and medium-sized vessel layers and choriocapillaris were less compressed than in G1A but exhibited basal membrane and endothelial changes similar to those in G1A. Normalization of serum cholesterol levels is not enough to reverse cholesterol-induced vascular damage to the choroid.

Although VEGF gene therapy can improve angiogenesis, uncontrolled VEGF secretion can lead to vascular tumor formation. Here we have explored the role of temporal VEGF expression, controlled by a tetracycline (TC)-regulated promoter, on revascularization and engraftment of genetically modified beta cells following transplantation. To this end, we modified the CDM3D beta cell line using a lentiviral vector to promote secretion of VEGF-A either in a TC-regulated (TET cells) or a constitutive (PGK cells) manner. VEGF secretion, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and stimulated insulin secretion were assessed in vitro. VEGF secretion was increased in TET and PGK cells, and VEGF delivery resulted in angiogenesis, whereas addition of TC inhibited these processes. Insulin secretion by the three cell types was similar. We used a syngeneic mouse model of transplantation to assess the effects of this controlled VEGF expression in vivo. Time to normoglycemia, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, graft vascular density, and cellular mass were evaluated. Increased expression of VEGF resulted in significantly better revascularization and engraftment after transplantation when compared to control cells. In vivo, there was a significant increase in vascular density in grafted TET and PGK cells versus control cells. Moreover, the time for diabetic mice to return to normoglycemia and the stimulated plasma glucose clearance were also significantly accelerated in mice transplanted with TET and PGK cells when compared to control cells. VEGF was only needed during the first 2-3 weeks after transplantation; when removed, normoglycemia and graft vascularization were maintained. TC-treated mice grafted with TC-treated cells failed to restore normoglycemia. This approach allowed us to switch off VEGF secretion when the desired effects had been achieved.

{"title": "The universal NF-kappaB inhibitor a20 protects from transplant vasculopathy by differentially affecting apoptosis in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.", "abstract": "Transplant vasculopathy (TV) is an accelerated form of atherosclerosis resulting in chronic rejection of vascularized allografts. The causes of TV are multifactorial and integrate at the level of the vascular wall, leading to a phenotypic switch of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). A20 is a NF-kappaB-dependent stress response gene in ECs and SMCs with potent anti-inflammatory effect in both cell types through blockade of NF-kappaB. A20 expression in ECs and SMCs correlates with the absence of TV in rat kidney allografts and long-term functioning human kidney allografts. We demonstrate that A20 protects ECs from tumor necrosis factor, Fas, and natural killer cell-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting proteolytic cleavage of caspase 8. A20 also safeguards ECs from complement-mediated necrosis. Hence, effectively shutting down cell death pathways initiated by inflammatory and immune offenders associated with TV. In contrast, A20 sensitizes SMCs to cytokine and Fas-mediated apoptosis through a novel nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. The unexpected proapoptotic effect of A20 in SMCs translates in vivo by the regression of established neointimal carotid lesions following balloon angioplasty in rats. Antedating apoptosis of SMCs, expression of the inducible NO synthase increases in A20-expressing neointimal SMCs, corroborating the involvement of NO in causing the proapoptotic effect of A20 in SMCs. Combined anti-inflammatory and anti- or proapoptotic functions of A20 in ECs and SMCs respectively qualify the positive effect of A20 upon vascular remodeling and healing.

We investigated aspects of osseointegration ranging from vascularization, cell proliferation, differentiation, and bone remodeling. In doing so, we gained an understanding of the healing mechanisms of different skeletal tissues during unloaded implant osseointegration.

We generated HAI-1 deficient mice, which died in utero due to placental defects. The HAI-1(-/-) placental labyrinth exhibited a complete failure of vascularization and a compact morphology of the trophoblast layer. Immunofluorescent staining of collagen IV and laminin and electron microscopy analysis revealed that this aberrant labyrinth architecture was associated with disrupted basement membranes located at the interface of chorionic trophoblasts and allantoic mesoderm. Unlike the placental labyrinth, basement membranes and vasculogenesis were normal in embryo and yolk sac. Therefore, basement membrane defects appear to be the underlying cause for the greatly impaired vascularization and trophoblast branching in HAI-1(-/-) placentas. In wild-type placentas, the expression of matriptase and prostasin co-localized with their physiological inhibitor HAI-1 to the labyrinthine trophoblast cells in proximity to basement membranes. In HAI-1(-/-) placentas, both the localization and expression of the two proteases remained unchanged, implying uncontrolled proteolytic activities of the two enzymes.

We address the epigenetic commitment of ASCs to the endothelial lineage. We report a bisulfite sequencing analysis of CpG methylation in the promoters of two endothelial-cell-specific genes, CD31 and CD144, in freshly isolated and in cultures of ASCs before and after induction of endothelial differentiation. In contrast to adipose tissue-derived endothelial (CD31(+)) cells, freshly isolated ASCs display a heavily methylated CD31 promoter and a mosaically methylated CD144 promoter despite basal transcription of both genes. Methylation state of both promoters remains globally stable upon culture. Endothelial stimulation of ASCs in methylcellulose elicits phenotypic changes, marginal upregulation of CD31, and CD144 expression and restrictive induction of a CD31(+)CD144(+) immunophenotype. These events are accompanied by discrete changes in CpG methylation in CD31 and CD144 promoters; however, no global demethylation that marks CD31(+) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells occurs. Immunoselection of CD31(+) cells after endothelial stimulation reveals consistent demethylation of one CpG immediately 3' of the transcription start site of the CD31 promoter. Adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation maintains CD31 and CD144 methylation patterns of undifferentiated cells. Methylation profiles of CD31 and CD144 promoters suggest a limited commitment of ASCs to the endothelial lineage. This contrasts with the reported hypomethylation of adipogenic promoters, which reflects a propensity of ASCs toward adipogenic differentiation.

In this work, a combination of dexamethasone and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated for concurrent localized delivery using PLGA microsphere/PVA hydrogel composites. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated by histopathological examination of subcutaneous tissue surrounding implanted composites using a rat model. The hydrogel composites were capable of simultaneously releasing VEGF and dexamethasone with approximately zero order kinetics. Composites were successful in controlling the implant/tissue interface by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis as well as facilitating neo-angiogenesis at a fraction of their typical oral or i.v. bolus doses. Implants containing VEGF showed a significantly higher number of mature blood vessels at the end of the 4 week study irrespective of the presence of dexamethasone. Thus, localized concurrent elution of VEGF and dexamethasone can overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of the corticosteroid and can be used to engineer inflammation-free and well-vascularized tissue in the vicinity of the implant.

{"title": "Glucose-deprived HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells are sensitive to verrucosidin as a GRP78 down-regulator.", "abstract": "Glucose deprivation, a feature of poorly vascularized solid tumors, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is a stress-signaling pathway in tumor cells that is associated with the molecular chaperone GRP78 and induction of GRP78 has been shown to protect them against programmed cell death. Thus, targeting glucose-deprived conditions may be a novel strategy in anticancer drug development. Based on that, we established a novel screening program for chaperone modulators that preferentially cytotoxic activity in cancer cells under glucose-deprived conditions. During the course of our screening system, we recently isolated an active compound, 326-2, from Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium and identified it as a down-regulator of the grp78 gene. As expected, 326-2 inhibited the expression of the GRP78 promoter under glucose-deprived conditions in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 50nM. Furthermore, 326-2 was identified as verrucosidin, a pyrone-type polyketide, by ESI-MS analyses and various NMR spectroscopic methods. We found that verrucosidin prevents UPR-induced expression of protein, such as GRP78, whose expression is induced by glucose-deprived or by 2-deoxyglucose; this effect is not seen under normal growth conditions. The GRP78-inhibitory action of verrucosidin was dependent on strict hypoglycemic conditions and resulted in selective cell death of glucose-deprived HT-29 human colon cancer cells.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2006-12-13", "authors": ["Hae-RyongPark", "In-JaRyoo", "Soo-JinChoo", "Ji-HwanHwang", "Ju-YoungKim", "Mi-RanCha", "KazuoShin-Ya", "Ick-DongYoo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2006.11.049"}

Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) is a multi-kinase inhibitor which targets receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases involved in tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis. The effect of sorafenib on tumor growth and tumor histology was assessed in both ectopic and orthotopic mouse models of RCC.\nSorafenib was administered orally to mice bearing subcutaneous (SC, ectopic) or sub-renal capsule (SRC, orthotopic) tumors of murine (Renca) or human (786-O) RCC. Treatment efficacy was determined by measurements of tumor volume and tumor growth delay. In mechanism of action studies, using the 786-O and Renca RCC tumor models, the effect of sorafenib was assessed after dosing for 3 or 5 days in the SC models and 21 days in the SRC models. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis was assessed by measuring level of CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effect of sorafenib on MAPK signaling, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation was also assessed by IHC by measuring levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-histone H3 and Ki-67 staining, respectively. The extent of tumor apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Finally, the effects of sorafenib on tumor hypoxia was assessed in 786-O SC model by injecting mice intravenously with pimonidazole hydrochloride 1 h before tumor collection and tumor sections were stained with a FITC-conjugated Hypoxyprobe antibody.\nSorafenib produced significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and a reduction in tumor vasculature of both ectopic and orthotopic Renca and 786-O tumors, at a dose as low as 15 mg/kg when administered daily. Inhibition of tumor vasculature was observed as early as 3 days post-treatment, and this inhibition of angiogenesis correlated with increased level of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL-positive) and central necrosis. Consistent with these results, a significant increase in tumor hypoxia was also observed 3 days post-treatment in 786-O SC model. However, no significant effect of sorafenib on phospho-ERK, phospho-histone H3 or Ki-67 levels in either RCC tumor model was observed.\nOur results show the ability of sorafenib to potently inhibit the growth of both ectopically- and orthotopically-implanted Renca and 786-O tumors. The observed tumor growth inhibition and tumor stasis or stabilization correlated strongly with decreased tumor angiogenesis, which was due, at least in part, to inhibition of VEGF and PDGF-mediated endothelial cell and pericyte survival. Finally, sorafenib-mediated inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis occurred at concentrations equivalent to those achieved in patients in the clinic.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2006-12-13", "authors": ["Yong SChang", "JalilaAdnane", "Pamela ATrail", "JoanLevy", "ArrisHenderson", "DahaiXue", "ElizabethBortolon", "MarinaIchetovkin", "CharlesChen", "AngelaMcNabola", "DeanWilkie", "Christopher ACarter", "Ian C ATaylor", "MarkLynch", "ScottWilhelm"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-006-0393-4"}

{"title": "A novel role for cyclooxygenase-2 in regulating vascular channel formation by human breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 expression correlates directly with highly aggressive and metastatic breast cancer, but the mechanism underlying this correlation remains obscure. We hypothesized that invasive human breast cancer cells that over-express COX-2 have the unique ability to differentiate into extracellular-matrix-rich vascular channels, also known as vasculogenic mimicry. Vascular channels have been associated with angiogenesis without involvement of endothelial cells, and may serve as another mechanism by which tumor cells obtain nutrients to survive, especially in less vascularized regions of the tumor.\nTo determine whether COX-2 regulates vascular channel formation, we assessed whether treatment with celecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) or silencing COX-2 synthesis by siRNA inhibits vascular channel formation by breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines were selected based on their invasive potential and COX-2 expression. Additionally, gene expression analysis was performed to identify candidate genes involved in COX-2-induced vascular channel formation. Finally, vascular channels were analyzed in surgically resected human breast cancer specimens that expressed varying levels of COX-2.\nWe found that invasive human breast cancer cells that over-express COX-2 develop vascular channels when plated on three-dimensional matigel cultures, whereas non-invasive cell lines that express low levels of COX-2 did not develop such channels. Similarly, we identified vascular channels in high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast over-expressing COX-2, but not in low-grade breast tumors. Vascular channel formation was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with celecoxib or COX-2 siRNA. Inhibition of channel formation was abrogated by addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2. In vitro results were corroborated in vivo in tumor-bearing mice treated with celecoxib. Using gene expression profiling, we identified several genes in the angiogenic and survival pathways that are engaged in vascular channel formation.\nAntivascular therapies targeting tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry may be an effective approach to the treatment of patients with highly metastatic breast cancer.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2006-12-13", "authors": ["Gargi DBasu", "Winnie SLiang", "Dietrich AStephan", "Lee TWegener", "Christopher RConley", "Barbara APockaj", "PinkuMukherjee"], "doi": "10.1186/bcr1626\n10.1126/science.2432664\n10.1002/ijc.10336\n10.1038/nrc1092\n10.1002/ijc.10423\n10.1073/pnas.131209798\n10.1002/ijc.1376\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81433-6\n10.1038/70995\n10.1186/bcr1019\n10.1074/jbc.275.15.11397\n10.1038/ng1296-457\n10.1038/288551a0\n10.1083/jcb.109.1.317\n10.1073/pnas.98.3.992\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690063\n10.1074/jbc.274.43.30896\n10.1074/jbc.274.34.23969\n10.1073/pnas.2535911100\n10.1016/0014-5793(95)00956-A\n10.1186/bcr585\n10.1126/science.1659742\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.06.036\n10.1200/JCO.2005.09.112\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00310-6"}

{"title": "CD133+ renal progenitor cells contribute to tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that resident progenitor cells may contribute to tumor vascularization and growth. CD133+ cells were isolated from 30 human renal carcinomas and characterized as renal resident progenitor cells on the basis of the expression of renal embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell markers. CD133+ progenitors differentiated into endothelial and epithelial cells as the normal CD133+ counterpart present in renal tissue. In the presence of tumor-derived growth factors, these cells were committed to differentiate into endothelial cells able to form vessels in vivo in SCID mice. Undifferentiated CD133+ progenitors were unable to form tumors when transplanted alone in SCID mice. When co-transplanted with renal carcinoma cells, CD133+ progenitors significantly enhanced tumor development and growth. This effect was not attributable to the tumorigenic nature of CD133+ progenitor cells because the same results were obtained with CD133+ cells from normal kidney. CD133+ progenitors contributed to tumor vascularization as the majority of neoformed vessels present within the transplanted tumors were of human origin and derived from the co-transplanted CD133+ progenitors. In conclusion, these results indicate the presence of a renal progenitor cell population in renal carcinomas that may differentiate in endothelial cells and favor vascularization and tumor growth.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2006-12-07", "authors": ["StefaniaBruno", "BenedettaBussolati", "CristinaGrange", "FedericaCollino", "Manuela EfremGraziano", "UgoFerrando", "GiovanniCamussi"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2006.060498"}

Overexpression of HO-1 after transduction with adenoviral vectors increased cell proliferation, resistance to oxidative stress generated by H2O2, and angiogenic potential as determined by induction of endothelial cell divisions. Likewise, cells stably transfected with HO-1 cDNA (B16-HO-1) showed higher proliferation, stress resistance, and angiogenic activity than the wild-type line (B16-WT). HO-1 overexpression in tumors significantly shortened survival of mice after subcutaneous injection of cancer cells (38 and 22 days for B16-WT and B16-HO-1, respectively; P=0.017). This also resulted in development of more packed tumors, with more melanoma cells, and reduced inflammatory edemas. Mice injected with B16-HO-1 had lower levels of tumor necrosis factor and higher serum concentrations of its soluble receptor tumor necrosis factor-RI, whereas tumors overexpressing HO-1 displayed augmented vascularization and stronger production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Finally, B16-HO-1 cells injected intravenously formed more metastases in lungs. Thus, HO-1 overexpression increased viability, proliferation, and angiogenic potential of melanoma cells, augmented metastasis, and decreased survival of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that induction of HO-1 may be detrimental in anti-cancer therapy of melanoma.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2006-12-07", "authors": ["HalinaWas", "TomaszCichon", "RyszardSmolarczyk", "DominikaRudnicka", "MagdalenaStopa", "CatherineChevalier", "Jean JLeger", "BozenaLackowska", "AnnaGrochot", "KarolinaBojkowska", "AnnaRatajska", "ClaudineKieda", "StanislawSzala", "JozefDulak", "AlicjaJozkowicz"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2006.051365"}

Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for the thymus not only in central deletional tolerance, but also in the induction of peripheral tolerance by vascularized renal allografts in juvenile miniature swine recipients. The same protocol did not induce tolerance in thymectomized recipients nor in recipients beyond the age of thymic involution. We subsequently reported that vascularized thymic lobe grafts from juvenile donors were capable of inducing tolerance in thymectomized juvenile hosts. However, the important question remained whether aged, involuted thymus could also induce tolerance if transplanted into thymectomized hosts, which, if true, would imply that thymic involution is not an intrinsic property of thymic tissue but is rather determined by host factors extrinsic to the thymus. We report here that aged, involuted thymus transplanted as a vascularized graft into juvenile recipients leads to rejuvenation of both thymic structure and function, suggesting that factors extrinsic to the thymus are capable of restoring juvenile thymic function to aged recipients. We show furthermore that rejuvenated aged thymus has the ability to induce transplant tolerance across class I MHC barriers.

Pegaptanib, a 28-nucleotide RNA aptamer specific for the VEGF(165) isoform, binds to it in the extracellular space, leaving other isoforms unaffected, and inhibits such key VEGF actions as promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival, and vascular permeability. Pegaptanib already has been examined as a treatment for two diseases associated with ocular neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Preclinical studies have shown that VEGF(165) alone mediates pathological ocular neovascularization and that its inactivation by pegaptanib inhibits the choroidal neovascularization observed in patients with neovascular AMD. In contrast, physiological vascularization, which is supported by the VEGF(121) isoform, is unaffected by this inactivation of VEGF(165). In addition, animal model studies have shown that intravitreous injection of pegaptanib can inhibit the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier characteristic of diabetes and even can reverse this damage to some degree. These preclinical findings formed the basis for randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of pegaptanib as a therapy for AMD and DME. The VEGF Inhibition Study in Ocular Neovascularization (VISION) trial comprising two replicate, pivotal phase 3 studies, demonstrated that intravitreous injection of pegaptanib resulted in significant clinical benefit, compared with sham injection, for all prespecified clinical end points, irrespective of patient demographics or angiographic subtype, and led to pegaptanib's approval as a treatment for AMD.

{"title": "Thrombospondins deployed by thrombopoietic cells determine angiogenic switch and extent of revascularization.", "abstract": "Thrombopoietic cells may differentially promote or inhibit tissue vascularization by releasing both pro- and antiangiogenic factors. However, the molecular determinants controlling the angiogenic phenotype of thrombopoietic cells remain unknown. Here, we show that expression and release of thrombospondins (TSPs) by megakaryocytes and platelets function as a major antiangiogenic switch. TSPs inhibited thrombopoiesis, diminished bone marrow microvascular reconstruction following myelosuppression, and limited the extent of revascularization in a model of hind limb ischemia. We demonstrate that thrombopoietic recovery following myelosuppression was significantly enhanced in mice deficient in both TSP1 and TSP2 (TSP-DKO mice) in comparison with WT mice. Megakaryocyte and platelet levels in TSP-DKO mice were rapidly restored, thereby accelerating revascularization of myelosuppressed bone marrow and ischemic hind limbs. In addition, thrombopoietic cells derived from TSP-DKO mice were more effective in supporting neoangiogenesis in Matrigel plugs. The proangiogenic activity of TSP-DKO thrombopoietic cells was mediated through activation of MMP-9 and enhanced release of stromal cell-derived factor 1. Thus, TSP-deficient thrombopoietic cells function as proangiogenic agents, accelerating hemangiogenesis within the marrow and revascularization of ischemic hind limbs. As such, interference with the release of cellular stores of TSPs may be clinically effective in augmenting neoangiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2006-12-05", "authors": ["Hans-GeorgKopp", "Andrea THooper", "M JohanBroekman", "Scott TAvecilla", "IsabellePetit", "MinLuo", "TillMilde", "Carlos ARamos", "FanZhang", "TabithaKopp", "PaulBornstein", "David KJin", "Aaron JMarcus", "ShahinRafii"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI29314\n10.1172/JCI24586"}

The 2D and 3D data sets were stored digitally. The vascular tree was stored separately using 3D fusion. In addition, a power Doppler (PD) examination was performed. A total of 644 individual images were evaluated by two independent readers. The lesions were evaluated using established criteria (BI-RADS classification). For statistical evaluation, the individual US measurements were classified according to the following two groups: those suggesting malignant lesions and those suggestive of benign lesions. Pearsons's chi-square test was performed for both groups. The 2D and 3D techniques were compared directly using kappa (kappa) statistics. Odds ratios (OR) were determined for the purpose of weighting the individual criteria. The sensitivities and specificities of 2D and 3D US were calculated.\nThe diagnostic value of 3D US was comparable to that of 2D US, with only slight differences observed for specific measurements. Analysis of 2D US data indicated that there was a strong correlation between malignant tumor growth and two specific 2D criteria: lesion margin and effect of the lesion on adjacent breast tissue (r (2) = 0.632, p < 0.001). Analysis of 3D images indicated that the significant measurements for tumor malignancy were shape and lesion margin in sagittal, transverse (r (2) = 0741, p < 0.001), and frontal views (r (2) = 0.592, p < 0.001) as well as retraction and lesion demarcation in the frontal views (r (2) = 0.649, p < 0.001). The comparison of 2D and 3D yielded primarily moderate (kappa = 0.412) to good (kappa = 0.789) agreement between the individual criteria. Crucial criteria for lesion characterization were the effect of the lesion on adjacent breast tissue (OR 47.8 [16.0-143.3]) in 2D US and the lesion margin (OR 36.4 [15.3-86.6]) and the 3 additional criteria of the frontal plane (OR 21.9-32.9) in 3D US.

Herein, we examined the role of host MMP-9 in subcutaneous and intraosseous growth of the human androgen independent prostate cancer cell line PC3 in MMP-9 deficient mice. In the subcutaneous model, the tumor incidence in the control (RAG-1(ko/ko)) and experimental (RAG-1(ko/ko) /MMP-9(ko/ko)) group was 100%, with similar tumor growth kinetics and microvascular densities. In the intraosseous tumor model, the tumor incidence was higher in RAG-1(ko/ko) /MMP-9(ko/ko mice than in RAG-1(ko/ko) mice (67% and 39%, respectively), though no statistical differences were found. The intraosseous tumor areas were similar in both groups, and the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts did not differ significantly. However, the microvascular density of intraosseous tumors was higher in RAG-1(ko/ko) than in RAG-1(ko/ko)/MMP-9(ko/ko) mice, though no changes in tumor growth could be detected. In an in vitro assay, we found that bone marrow (BM) cells increased the invasiveness of PC3 cells, and that this enhancement was independent of MMP-9 expression by marrow cells.

One dimensional (1D) mathematical models, based on systems of two partial differential equations for each arterial segment suitably matched at bifurcations, can be simulated with low computational costs and provide useful insights into the role of wave reflections. Some recent works have indeed moved in this direction. The specific contribution of the present paper is to illustrate a 1D numerical model numerically coupled with a model for the heart action. Typically, the action of the heart on the arterial system is modelled as a boundary condition at the entrance of the aorta. However, the left ventricle (LV) and the vascular network are a strongly coupled single mechanical system. This coupling can be relevant in the numerical description of pressure waves propagation, particularly when dealing with pathological situations.

We sought to resolve some of the recent discrepancies in the rat-to-mouse xenograft model where different recipient strains are used and investigated the TH1/TH2 influence on rejection.\nLewis rat heart xenograft survival was compared between BALB/c and C57BL/6 recipients. Antigraft antibody deposition, serum anti-rat antibody levels and B-cell deficient recipients were used to examine the contribution of antibody to rejection. To further investigate a TH1 or TH2 bias effect in vivo, we used BALB/c STAT4 knockout (KO) and STAT6 KO recipient mice. Experiments were repeated with rat skin xenografts to examine TH1/TH2 influences on cell-mediated rejection.\nThe median survival (MS) of rat heart xenografts in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice was five and eight days, respectively (P = 0.002). The MS in B-cell deficient mice was 16 days (P < 0.001). The MS in STAT4 KO and STAT6 KO mice was six and seven days respectively (P = 0.009). All non-B-cell deficient recipients showed strong IgM deposition and histological features of both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection. There was no correlation between serum anti-rat antibody levels and graft outcome or graft deposition. There was no survival difference of skin xenografts in BALB/c, C57BL/6, B-cell deficient, STAT6 KO, or STAT4 KO mice (8-9 days).\nBoth humoral and cell-mediated immunity have significant roles in vascularized heart xenograft rejection.

Two issues that must be addressed before cell therapy could be used routinely in medicine are improved efficacy of the transplanted cells and demonstrated long-term safety. Desirable genetic modifications that could be made to cells to be used for cell therapy include immortalization with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). We have used a model for cell therapy in which transplantation of adrenocortical cells restores glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone levels in adrenalectomized immunodeficient mice. In this model, clones of cells that had been immortalized with hTERT were shown to be able to replace the function of the animals' adrenal glands by forming vascularized tissue structures when cells were transplanted beneath the capsule of the kidney. hTERT-modified cells showed no tendency for neoplastic changes. Moreover, a series of experiments showed that hTERT does not cooperate with known oncoproteins in tumorigenesis either in adrenocortical cells or in human fibroblasts. Nevertheless, hTERT was required for tumorigenesis when cells were implanted subcutaneously rather than in the subrenal capsule space. Changes in gene expression make hTERT-modified cells more robust. Understanding these changes is important so as to be able to separately control immortalization and other desirable properties of cells that could be used in cell therapy. Alternatively, desirable properties of transplants might be provided by co-transplanted mesenchymal cells: mesenchymal cell-assisted cell therapy.

Retinas were also examined at the end of 12-hour dark or light periods, and a separate group was treated with l-cis-diltiazem at the beginning of a 12-hour dark period. Hypoxia was assessed by deposition of hypoxyprobe (HP) and HP-protein adducts were localized by immunohistochemistry and quantified using ELISA. Also, hypoxia-regulated gene expression and transcriptional activity were assessed alongside vascular density.\nHypoxia was observed in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers in WT retina and was significantly reduced in Rho-/- mice (P < 0.05). Retinal hypoxia was significantly increased during dark adaptation in WT mice (P < 0.05), whereas no change was observed in Rho-/- or with l-cis-diltiazem-treated WT mice.

{"title": "Functional corpora lutea are formed in matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-treated plasminogen-deficient mice.", "abstract": "Corpus luteum (CL) formation involves dramatic tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. To determine the functional roles of the plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems in these processes, we have studied CL formation and function in plasminogen (plg)-deficient mice, with or without treatment with the broad-spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitor galardin. Both the adult pseudopregnant CL model and the gonadotropin-primed immature mouse model were used. We found that CL formed normally not only in plasminogen-deficient mice and in galardin-treated wild-type mice, but also in galardin-treated plg-deficient mice, suggesting that neither of the plasminogen activator and MMP systems is essential for CL formation. Nevertheless, in plg-deficient mice, serum progesterone levels were reduced by approximately 50%, and the progesterone levels were not reduced further by galardin treatment. When CL from plg-deficient mice were stained for several molecular markers for CL development and regression, they appeared healthy and vascularized, and were indistinguishable from CL from wild-type mice. This implies that the reduced progesterone levels were not caused by impaired CL formation. Taken together, our data suggest that neither plasmin nor MMPs, alone or in combination, are required for CL formation. Therefore, the tissue remodeling and angiogenesis processes during CL formation may be mediated by redundant protease systems. However, the reduced serum progesterone levels in plg-deficient mice suggest that plasmin, but not MMPs, plays a role in maintenance of luteal function.

Genetic prespecification vs. hemodynamics.", "abstract": "Vascular network remodeling, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis play an important role in the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Based on recent studies of vascular network development in the embryo, several novel aspects to angiogenesis have been identified as crucial to generate a functional vascular network. These aspects include specification of arterial and venous identity in vessels and network patterning. In early embryogenesis, vessel identity and positioning are genetically hardwired and involve neural guidance genes expressed in the vascular system. We demonstrated that, during later stages of embryogenesis, blood flow plays a crucial role in regulating vessel identity and network remodeling. The flow-evoked remodeling process is dynamic and involves a high degree of vessel plasticity. The open question in the field is how genetically predetermined processes in vessel identity and patterning balance with the contribution of blood flow in shaping a functional vascular architecture. Although blood flow is essential, it remains unclear to what extent flow is able to act on the developing cardiovascular system. There is significant evidence that mechanical forces created by flowing blood are biologically active within the embryo and that the level of mechanical forces and the type of flow patterns present in the embryo are able to affect gene expression.

{"title": "Regulation of angiogenesis by hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors.", "abstract": "Maintenance of oxygen homeostasis is critical for the survival of multicellular organs. As a result, both invertebrates and vertebrates have developed highly specialized mechanisms to sense changes in oxygen levels and to mount adequate cellular and systemic responses to these changes. Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, occurs in physiological situations such as during embryonic development, as well as in pathological conditions such as ischemia, wound healing, and cancer. A primary effector of the adaptive response to hypoxia in mammals is the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription regulators. These proteins activate the expression of a broad range of genes that mediate many of the responses to decreased oxygen concentration, including enhanced glucose uptake, increased red blood cell production, and the formation of new blood vessels via angiogenesis. This latter process is dynamic and results in the establishment of a mature vascular system that is indispensable for proper delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all cells in both normal tissue and hypoxic regions. Angiogenesis is essential for normal development and neoplastic disease as tumors must develop mechanisms to stimulate vascularization to meet increasing metabolic demands. The link between hypoxia and the regulation of angiogenesis is an area of intense research and the molecular details of this connection are still being elaborated.

The purpose of this study was to find explanations for these processes by searching for alternative pathways regulating glioma angiogenesis and reveal a correlation with tumor grade. Thus, VEGFR3, which is not expressed in normal brain, and its ligands VEGF-C and -D, were assessed in high grade (WHO degrees IV, glioblastomas, GBM) and low grade gliomas [WHO degrees II astrocytomas (AII)]. In all GBM, a strong protein expression of VEGFR3 was found on tumor endothelium, VEGF-C and -D expression was found on numerous cells in areas of high vascularization. On RNA level, a significant up-regulation of VEGFR3 was detected in GBM compared to AII and non-neoplastic brain. In AII, only very moderate VEGFR3, VEGF-C and -D expression was found on protein and RNA level indicating a correlation of VEGFR3 expression with tumor grade. VEGFR3 signal in both grades was found predominantly on endothelial cells, confirmed by VEGFR3 expression on isolated CD31 positive cells and the expression of various endothelial markers on VEGFR3-positive cells isolated from GBM.

Myeloid-specific hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression was required for this function, and we also demonstrate that endogenous microglia participated in retinal vascularization. These findings suggest what we believe to be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic retinopathies that promotes vascular repair rather than destruction.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2006-11-18", "authors": ["Matthew RRitter", "EyalBanin", "Stacey KMoreno", "EdithAguilar", "Michael IDorrell", "MartinFriedlander"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI29683\n10.1172/JCI200421686\n10.1172/JCI200420465"}

The three other species of the genus have each been shown to encode homologs of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We report here that PVNZ strain RD86 also encodes a VEGF and that the predicted PVNZ protein shows only 37-54% amino acid identity to VEGFs encoded by the other species of the genus. Despite this extensive sequence divergence, assays of purified PVNZ VEGF (PVNZ(RD86)VEGF) demonstrated that it shares the unique VEGF receptor (VEGFR) binding profile of the other parapoxvirus VEGFs, in that it binds VEGFR-2 and induces VEGFR-2-mediated proliferation of Ba/F3-derived cells, but does not bind VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3. In contrast to some other viral VEGFs, it does not bind neuropilin-1. Our results indicate that PVNZ(RD86)VEGF is a biologically active member of the VEGF family and is likely to contribute to the proliferative and highly vascularized nature of PVNZ lesions. Our data also reveal that all members of the genus encode a VEGF and that an extraordinary degree of inter-species sequence variation is a general feature of the parapoxvirus VEGFs.", "journal": "Virus research", "date": "2006-11-18", "authors": ["NorihitoUeda", "Marie KInder", "Lyn MWise", "Stephen BFleming", "Andrew AMercer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.virusres.2006.09.012"}

To study the role of endoglin in tumor growth and angiogenesis we induced a highly vascularized tumor in mice heterozygous for endoglin (Eng+/-) and in their control littermates (Eng+/+) by injecting 10(6) Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) cells subcutaneously. Nine days after injection, the tumor was removed and weighed. Capillary density (CD31 immunohistochemistry), hemoglobin content and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression were used to assess tumor vascularization. Tumor perfusion rate was measured by laser-Doppler technique. Expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by Western blot analysis. The aerobic metabolism and oxygen dependency were inferred from the measurement of ATP in tumoral tissue. Tumor weight, capillary density, hemoglobin and VCAM-1 were reduced by about 30% in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+ littermates. The protein levels of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS were significantly reduced in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+ mice. HIF expression was slightly reduced whereas VEGF level was slightly increased in Eng+/- compared to Eng+/+. Tumor tissue levels of ATP and ADP were similar in both types of mice.

Although acute ultraviolet-induced skin angiogenesis has been investigated, little is known about the distinct effects of acute infrared (IR) radiation on angiogenesis in human skin.\nTo elucidate the molecular regulation of the angiogenic switch by acute near-IR radiation or by a single heat treatment in human skin in vivo.\nWe subjected 16 healthy volunteers to near-IR irradiation (six minimal heating doses) and 14 healthy volunteers to heat treatment (43 degrees C for 90 min), and skin specimens were obtained by punch biopsy for immunohistochemical, Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses.\nWe observed that CD31-stained vessels in the upper dermis were increased after acute near-IR exposure, and that this was associated with the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the downregulation of thrombospondin (TSP)-2. During the application of near-IR to buttock skin, skin temperatures immediately increased from 32 degrees C up to 42 degrees C, as measured using a digital thermometer. Moreover, the expression of inducible heat shock protein 70 was increased after near-IR irradiation in human skin. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a single heat treatment on angiogenesis and on the expression of VEGF and TSP-2 in skin, and found that vascularization and VEGF expression were increased, whereas TSP-2 expression was reduced.\nOur results suggest that IR radiation plays an important role in skin angiogenesis via regulation of the balance between the angiogenic inducer VEGF and the angiogenic inhibitor TSP-2, and that IR-induced skin angiogenesis might be partially caused by the effects of heat in human skin in vivo.", "journal": "The British journal of dermatology", "date": "2006-11-17", "authors": ["M-SKim", "Y KKim", "K HCho", "J HChung"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07510.x"}

In the patients who were followed-up during several or many years (in one, during 33 years and, in two, during 25 years), neuroimaging studies were done by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). One patient also had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\nAll patients showed bilateral occlusion of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid arteries. The basilar artery was markedly narrowed in one patient. One patient with very early onset of symptoms also showed collateral vascularization through the Bernasconi- Cassinari artery. Cerebral multifocal cortical and subcortical lesions were seen in the patients who had very long follow-up, although these already had appeared in the first MR studies. One patient showed arterial moyamoya 31 images and fibromuscular dysplasia. She was the only patient treated surgically during childhood with death after a short time. Another patient had a pregnancy and vaginal delivery at 26 years of age without complications. Images of moyamoya did not disappear in any of the patients in this series.

The insufficient vascularization of this tissue prevents it from healing completely after extreme tearing or rupture, creating a need for ACL grafts for reconstruction. The limitations of existing grafts have motivated the investigation of tissue-engineered ACL grafts. A successful tissue-engineered graft must possess mechanical properties similar to the ACL; to date no commercially available synthetic graft has achieved this. To accomplish this goal we have combined the techniques of polymer fiber braiding and twisting to design a novel poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) braid-twist scaffold for ACL tissue engineering. The scaffold is designed to accurately mimic the biomechanical profile and mechanical properties of the ACL. In this study, braid-twist scaffolds were constructed and compared to braided scaffolds and twisted fiber scaffolds. The addition of fiber twisting to the braided scaffold resulted in a significant increase in the ultimate tensile strength, an increase in ultimate strain, and an increase in the length of the toe region in these constructs over scaffolds that were braided.

{"title": "Three-dimensional ultrasound assessment of endometrial receptivity: a review.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) is a new imaging modality, which is being introduced into clinical practice. Although this technique will not probably replace two-dimensional ultrasound, it is being increasingly used. It has been reported that 3D US is a very high reproducible technique.

The aim of this paper is to address some technical aspects of 3D US and to review critically its current status in evaluating endometrial function with special focus in its role in predicting pregnancy in assisted reproductive techniques. In spontaneous cycles endometrial volume grows during follicular phase remaining constant through the luteal phase.

{"title": "The tumour-Clostridium phenomenon: 50 years of developmental research (Review).", "abstract": "The tumour-Clostridium phenomenon describes the specific affinity of spore forming anaerobes to tumour growth. The discovery of strictly intratumoral tetanus toxic infections in tumour-bearing mice after intravenous spore administration gave the impulse to search for non-toxic clostridial isolates with tumour-selective properties for clostridial biotherapy, i.e. oncolysis, as well as serologic tumour diagnostics without any toxic side-effects. Systematic studies of the oncolytic process and its variables on diverse experimental tumours and laboratory animals revealed that tumour liquefaction, converting necrotic tumour parts to putrid abscesses filled with masses of clostridial forms, stops sharply at the viable rim of the blood-supplied tumour tissue. Similar results were observed in clinical trials, particular of gliomas. Before oncolysis is initiated, the first stage of clostridial multi-plication in the vascularized tissue is inducing a humoral immune response, preceded by phagocytic activity. The majority of tumour-bearing laboratory and domestic animals, so far tested serologically, clinical cancer patients as well, responded with anti-rod antibodies and, independently, anti-spore antibodies. Oncolytic and non-oncolytic Clostridia were equally immunogenic. During the early, immunizing period of clostridial proliferation, analytical tumour-tetanus experiments were focused on potential relations between tumour growth kinetics and rod proliferation. Based on realistic growth models and target principles, computer simulations could reproduce the results, i.e. cumulative curves of tetanus lethality in groups of mice. Thus, crucial assumptions of the mathematical model were ex post confirmed by further experiments. Our working hypothesis concentrates on temporally hypoxic micro-niches close to a pre-mitotic cell with enhanced oxygen demand which can be utilized by anaerobes (randomly) located there. As early immune reactions to clostridial antigens via phagocytosis and humoral immune response will do without invasion in necrobiotic avascular tumour areas, the pacemaker model of tumour-Clostridium interplay extends the scope of genetically engineered Clostridia to early treatment of metastases. Thus, novel concepts, such as 'Clostridia-directed enzyme prodrug-therapy' and 'Combined bacteriolytic therapy', together with immune activation, can come into play.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2006-11-08", "authors": ["WilliSchmidt", "Eva-MariaFabricius", "UlrichSchneeweiss"], "doi": null}

D93 recognized dn-collagen but not native (nat) collagen of different species, including mouse, chicken, and human, indicating that its cryptic binding site(s) is conserved across species. In immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, D93 stained the basement membrane of blood vessels in several xenograft human tumors or in surgically removed tumor tissues from patients with different types of malignancies. D93 staining was rarely or not present in normal blood vessels of healthy tissues. In in vivo experiments, D93 significantly inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the tumor growth of pre-established orthotopic human breast (MDA-MB-435) tumors in mice. D93 i.v. administered in mice was subsequently detected in the subendothelial basement membrane of tumor blood vessels but not blood vessels of normal tissues. Inhibition of growth of pre-established orthotopic human breast MDA-MB-435 tumors was more effective when D93 was combined with Taxol, than either treatment alone. In addition, tumors from animals treated with D93 and/or Taxol showed significantly reduced levels of the endothelial cell-marker CD31.

{"title": "[Adult lateral meniscus].", "abstract": "Meniscal lesion does not mean meniscectomy and this is particularly true for the lateral meniscus. The reputation of mildness of the meniscectomy is usurped. The rate of joint space narrowing after lateral meniscectomy is of 40% at a follow-up of 13 years compared to 28% for the medial meniscus (symposium SFA 1996). Several arguments explain those results: biomechanical: the lateral meniscus contributes to the congruence; particularly the lateral meniscus is the zone where antero-posterior translational during knee flexion is 12 mm. The pejorative effects of lateral meniscectomy have conducted, more though to the medial meniscus, to the concept of meniscal economy. Lateral meniscectomy must be as partial as possible. Particularly, a discoid meniscus presenting a complete tear should be treated by a meniscoplasty in order to shape the meniscus in a more anatomic form than a total meniscectomy. Lateral meniscectomy is indicated in complex or horizontal cleavage, symptomatic, on stable knees. A particular case is the cyst of the lateral meniscus. It is a cystic subcutaneous formation, usual consequence of a horizontal cleaved meniscus of which the particularity is that it opens besides the articulation. The strategy must not consist in the isolated treatment of the cyst. This pathology should be addressed by an arthroscopic meniscectomy reaching the meniscosynovial junction at the level of the cyst. Meniscal repair must be proposed every time if possible. Criteria of reparability are better studied on MRI. Preoperatively MRI is the first choice radiological exam. Two essential indications can be held back: the vertical peripheral longitudinal lesion is on the non-vascularized area, and the horizontal cleaving of the junior athlete (if the cleaving remains purely intra meniscal). Meniscal repair is highly performed when the meniscal tear is associated to a rupture of the ACL (simultaneous reconstruction of the LCA). Postoperative outcome is different of that of a \"simple\" arthroscopic meniscectomy. The healing process being slow, it suits to protect the suture by a splint in the first month, and with an exclusion of sports with knee torsion during 6 months. Functional results (absence of secondary meniscectomy) and anatomical results (reality of the cicatrisation) are good in 77% of cases (symposium of the French Society of Arthroscopy 2003) at a follow-up of 55 months. Survivorship analysis indicates that majority of the failures occur within two years: this testifies a default of primary cicatrisation. At the studied follow-up, meniscal repair was efficient to protect the cartilage. Lateral meniscus results are better that medial meniscus one. Those data support indications: All suspicion of meniscal lesion must have an MRI preoperatively to confirm the lesion, to localize her and to search criteria of reparability; All vertical longitudinal peripheral lesions can and must be repaired especially in young patients and children; All horizontal cleaving of the junior athletes should be treated by open repair; surgical abstention must be proposed when the lesion is non symptomatic, or when lesion is limited and associated to an ACL tear (in that case isolated ACL reconstruction is proposed), or when clinical symptoms are minimal; Meniscectomy, always arthroscopic, is proposed for a symptomatic lesion in the avascular zone or for a deep horizontal cleavage or a complex tear; Tear of the discoid meniscus should be treated by meniscoplasty. A painful knee after lateral meniscectomy might be due to a too limited initial meniscectomy: an iterative meniscectomy may be indicated or lateral femorotibial arthritis, especially after subtotal or total meniscectomy. In this last case and after failure of usual medical treatment such as viscosupplementation surgery may be indicated. Osteotomy in order to unload the lateral femorotibial compartment gives a partial response as the shearing forces remain. This osteotomy is indicated only if the lower limb axis is normal or in valgus. Meniscal allograft is an option in young patients in grade I or II arthritis. Results are promising. Rene Verdonk's series show a survivorship analysis of 75% at 7 years. Early diagnosis of a postmeniscectomy syndrome before cartilaginous lesions occur is essential for an adapted treatment. In conclusion, lateral meniscectomy are less frequent than those of the medial meniscus but their prognosis is less favorable. They should be early diagnosed (MRI). Treatment options are various: abstention, meniscectomy, and repair. Painful post lateral meniscectomy syndrome may be treated by a new surgical option: meniscal allograft.", "journal": "Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur", "date": "2006-11-08", "authors": ["PBeaufils", "PHardy", "PChambat", "PClavert", "PDjian", "AFrank", "CHulet", "J-FPotel", "RVerdonk", "NoneNone"], "doi": null}

The floral anatomy of Actinocephalus polyanthus, Leiothrix fluitans, Paepalanthus chlorocephalus, P. flaccidus and Rondonanthus roraimae was studied here. The flowers of these species of Paepalanthoideae are unisexual, and form capitulum-type inflorescences. Staminate and pistillate flowers are randomly distributed in the capitulum and develop centripetally. This work aims to establish a floral nomenclature for the Eriocaulaceae to provide more information about the taxonomy and phylogeny of the family.\nLight microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and chemical tests were used to investigate the floral structures.\nStaminate and pistillate flowers are trimerous (except in P. flaccidus, which presents dimerous flowers), and the perianth of all species is differentiated into sepals and petals. Staminate flowers present an androecium with scale-like staminodes (not in R. roraimae) and fertile stamens, and nectariferous pistillodes. Pistillate flowers present scale-like staminodes (except for R. roraimae, which presents elongated and vascularized staminodes), and a gynoecium with a hollow style, ramified in stigmatic and nectariferous portions.\nThe scale-like staminodes present in the species of Paepalanthoideae indicate a probable reduction of the outer whorl of stamens present in species of Eriocauloideae. Among the Paepalanthoideae genera, Rondonanthus, which is probably basal, shows vascularized staminodes in their pistillate flowers. The occurrence of nectariferous pistillodes in staminate flowers and that of nectariferous portions of the style in pistillate flowers of Paepalanthoideae are emphasized as nectariferous structures in Eriocaulaceae.", "journal": "Annals of botany", "date": "2006-11-07", "authors": ["Michele MarcelinoRosa", "Vera LuciaScatena"], "doi": "10.1093/aob/mcl231"}

{"title": "Ephrin-A1 facilitates mammary tumor metastasis through an angiogenesis-dependent mechanism mediated by EphA receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor in mice.", "abstract": "Ephrin-A1, the prototypic ligand for EphA receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in vascularized tumors relative to normal tissue. Moreover, ephrin-A1-Fc fusion proteins induce endothelial cell sprouting, migration, and assembly in vitro, and s.c. vascular remodeling in vivo. Based on these data, we hypothesized that native, membrane-bound ephrin-A1 regulates tumor angiogenesis and progression. We tested this hypothesis using a transplantable mouse mammary tumor model. Small interfering RNA-mediated ephrin-A1 knockdown in metastatic mammary tumor cells significantly diminishes lung metastasis without affecting tumor volume, invasion, intravasation, or lung colonization upon i.v. injection in vivo. Ephrin-A1 knockdown reduced tumor-induced endothelial cell migration in vitro and microvascular density in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of ephrin-A1 in nonmetastatic mammary tumor cells elevated microvascular density and vascular recruitment. Overexpression of ephrin-A1 elevated wild-type but not EphA2-deficient endothelial cell migration toward tumor cells, suggesting that activation of EphA2 on endothelial cells is one mechanism by which ephrin-A1 regulates angiogenesis. Furthermore, ephrin-A1 knockdown diminished, whereas overexpression of ephrin-A1 elevated, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in tumor cell-conditioned medium, suggesting that ephrin-A1-mediated modulation of the VEGF pathway is another mechanism by which membrane-tethered ephrin-A1 regulates angiogenic responses from initially distant host endothelium.

The purpose of this study was to document the clinical and radiographic results of total hip arthroplasty performed following failure of a free vascularized fibular grafting procedure.\nTwenty total hip arthroplasties in eighteen patients who had previously undergone a free vascularized fibular grafting procedure for the treatment of osteonecrosis were retrospectively reviewed. A straight-stem femoral component was used in twelve hips, a tapered femoral component with removal of residual fibular graft was used in five hips, and a tapered stem without graft removal was used in three hips. The twelve hips with a straight-stem femoral component and previous vascularized fibular grafting were compared with thirty-six osteonecrotic hips in thirty other patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty but had not had previous free vascularized fibular grafting. The radiographic outcomes with respect to initial femoral component alignment and subsequent migration and the clinical outcomes were compared.\nAnalysis of the immediate postoperative radiographs demonstrated significantly improved alignment of the femoral component when a high-speed burr had been used to remove residual fibular graft (p = 0.001), although doing so did significantly increase both the intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.017) and the operative time (p = 0.0002). There was no significant difference in the amount of migration of either the acetabular or the femoral component between the control and study groups at the time of the most recent follow-up. When comparing patients with or without a previous free vascularized fibular graft, the mean postoperative scores at three years were significantly worse in patients who had undergone a previous free vascularized fibular graft (p = 0.03). One revision occurred in the study group at seventy-two months due to acetabular wear, and one revision occurred in the control group at 108 months due to aseptic loosening.\nThis study raises concern that the outcome of total hip arthroplasty in patients who previously underwent a free vascularized fibular graft for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head may be worse than that in patients without previous free vascularized fibular grafting. The intraoperative use of a high-speed burr can improve the alignment of the femoral component by removing more of the residual graft.

Core decompression alone is associated with a lack of structural support with inconsistent outcomes, whereas vascularized fibular grafting requires an extensive surgical procedure with high donor-site morbidity and prolonged rehabilitation. The adjunctive use of a porous tantalum implant offers the advantages of core decompression, structural support, minimally invasive surgery, and no donor-site morbidity. The purpose of this study was to assess the survivorship and to evaluate the clinical results and radiographic outcomes of hips in which osteonecrosis of the femoral head was treated with core decompression and a porous tantalum implant.\nWe evaluated fifty-four patients (sixty consecutive hips) in whom osteonecrosis of the femoral head was treated with core decompression and insertion of a porous tantalum implant. Fifty-two patients (fifty-eight hips) were available for follow-up at a mean of twenty-four months. All patients were sixty-five years of age or younger (mean age, thirty-five years). According to the classification system of Steinberg et al., one hip (2%) had stage-I disease, forty-nine hips (84%) had stage-II disease, and eight hips (14%) had stage-III disease. Outcome measures that were used included a limb-specific score (Harris hip score), radiographic outcome measures, and survivorship analysis with revision to total hip arthroplasty as the end point.\nOverall, nine hips (15.5%) were converted to total hip arthroplasty, including six with stage-II disease and three with stage-III disease.

The alpha-gal epitope, present in all mammals except humans, apes and Old World monkeys, is a decisive obstruction to successful xenotransplantation of vascularized organs as the reaction of alpha-gal-bearing endothelia with natural alpha-gal antibodies in the human blood mediates hyperacute rejection of the xenograft. Alpha-galactosyl transferase knockout mice (alpha-GT KO) develop cataract, but no other lesions have been established in these mice. Here we report for the first time that alpha-GT KO mice have impaired glucose tolerance (p<0.001) and decreased insulin sensitivity (p<0.0001). Homeostasis model assessment shows impaired beta-cell function (p<0.05). Similar physiological changes have not been examined in the alpha-galactosyl transferase pig.

The photocrosslinked chitosan hydrogel showed strong sealing strength and potential use as a new tissue adhesive in surgical application. Paclitaxel, which is an anti-tumor reagent and a vascularization-inhibitor, retained in the photocrosslinked chitosan hydrogel, and were gradually released from the photocrosslinked chitosan hydrogel in vivo upon the degradation of the hydrogel. The paclitaxel-incorporated photocrosslinked chitosan hydrogels effectively inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice. On the other hand, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 molecules also retained in both the photocrosslinked chitosan and an injectable chitosan/IO(4)-heparin hydrogels, and were gradually released from the hydrogels upon their in vivo biodegradations. The activity of FGF-2 in the hydrogels was stable for long time (more than 14 days). The controlled release of biologically active FGF-2 molecules from the hydrogels caused an induction of the angiogenesis and, possibly, collateral circulation occurred in the healing-impaired diabetic (db/db) mice and the ischemic limbs of rats. The purpose of this review is to describe the effectiveness of the chitosan hydrogels (photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel and chitosan/IO(4)-heparin hydrogel) as a local drug delivery carrier for FGF-2 and paclitaxel to control wound repair, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. It is thus proposed that the chitosan hydrogels may be a promising new local carrier for drugs such as FGF-2 and paclitaxel.", "journal": "Current drug delivery", "date": "2006-11-02", "authors": ["MasayukiIshihara", "MasanoriFujita", "KiyohayaObara", "HidemiHattori", "ShingoNakamura", "MasakiNambu", "TomoharuKiyosawa", "YasuhiroKanatani", "BonpeiTakase", "MakotoKikuchi", "TadaakiMaehara"], "doi": "10.2174/156720106778559047"}

{"title": "Muscle blood flow and oxygenation measured by NMR imaging and spectroscopy.", "abstract": "Tissue perfusion and oxygenation in many organs can be evaluated by various NMR techniques. This review focuses on the specificities, limitations and adaptations of the NMR tools available to investigate perfusion and oxygenation in the skeletal muscle of humans and animal models. A description of how they may be used simultaneously is provided as well. 1H NMR spectroscopy of myoglobin (Mb) monitors intramyocytic oxygenation. It measures the level of deoxy-Mb, from which Mb concentration, Mb desaturation/resaturation rates, muscle oxygenation changes and intracellular partial oxygen pressure (pO2) can be calculated. Positive and negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrasts exist in skeletal muscle. BOLD contrasts primarily reflect changes in capillary-venous oxygenation, but are also directly or indirectly dependent on muscle blood volume, perfusion, vascular network architecture and angulation, relative to the main magnetic field. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) techniques, having high spatial and temporal resolution, are the methods of choice to quantify and map skeletal muscle perfusion non-invasively. Limitations of ASL are poor contrast-to-noise ratio and sensitivity to movement; however, with the introduction of specific adaptations, it has been proven possible to measure skeletal muscle perfusion at both rest and during exercise. The possibility of combining these NMR measurements with others into a single dynamic protocol is most interesting. The 'multiparametric functional (mpf) NMR' concept can be extended to include the evaluation of muscle energy metabolism simultaneously with 31P NMR or with lactate double quantum filtered 1H NMR spectroscopy, an approach which would make NMR an exceptional tool for non-invasive investigations of integrative physiology and biochemistry in skeletal muscle in vivo.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2006-11-01", "authors": ["P GCarlier", "DBertoldi", "CBaligand", "CWary", "YFromes"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1081"}

{"title": "Techniques for restoring bowel continuity and function after rectal cancer surgery.", "abstract": "A very low local recurrence rate of 3%-6% (associated with improved 5 year survival) is possible when proper oncological surgery is performed of mid and distal rectal adenocarcinoma. Restoration of bowel continuity is possible in most cases, without compromise of cancer clearance. Re-anastomosis can be performed with stapled, transabdominal hand-sewn or coloanal pull-through techniques. However after a direct (straight) anastomosis of the colon to the distal rectum/anus, up to 33% of patients have 3 or more bowel movements/d; some can be troubled with up to 14 stools a day. Construction of a 6-cm colonic J-pouch is likely to cause some reversed peristalsis which improves postoperative bowel frequency without causing neo-rectum evacuation problems. Colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis patients have a median of 3 bowel movements a day compared with a median of 6 a day for straight anastomoses, at 1 year after surgery. In the longer term, bowel adaptation may enable the function after a straight anastomosis to approximate that of a colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis. This probably depends in the former, upon whether the more rigid sigmoid colon or more distensible descending colon is used. An additional advantage of the colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis is the lower risk of anastomotic complications. A more vascularized side-to-end (colonic J-pouch-anal) anastomosis is likely to heal better than an end-to-end (straight) anastomosis. Where the pelvis is too narrow for a bulky colonic J-pouch anal anastomosis, a coloplasty-anal-anastomosis is an option. The latter results in postoperative bowel function comparable with the colonic J-pouch. However, the risk of anastomotic complications is higher possibly related to its end-to-end anastomotic configuration. Laparoscopic techniques for accomplishing all the above are being proven to be effective. Restorative surgery for rectal cancer can be safely and effectively performed with methods to improve bowel function very acceptably; the future advances are likely in laparoscopy.", "journal": "World journal of gastroenterology", "date": "2006-10-31", "authors": ["Yik-HongHo"], "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v12.i39.6252"}

We report here that ablation of the gene leads to early embryonic lethality, correlating well with the high expression of the protein during embryonic development. We observed an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas protein in E9.5 PTP-PEST(-/-) embryos, a first evidence of biochemical defect leading to abnormal growth and development. Analysis of null mutant embryos revealed that they reach gastrulation, initiate yolk sac formation, but fail to progress through normal subsequent developmental events. E9.5-10.5 PTP-PEST(-/-) embryos had morphological abnormalities such as defective embryo turning, improper somitogenesis and vasculogenesis, impaired liver development, accompanied by degeneration in both neuroepithelium and somatic epithelia. Moreover, in embryos surviving until E10.5, the caudal region was truncated, with severe mesenchyme deficiency and no successful liver formation.

High density DNA microarray analysis has identified direct and indirect targets of Pgr action. One of the targets of Pgr action is a member of the Hedgehog morphogen Indian Hedgehog, Ihh. Ihh and members of the Hh signaling cascade show a coordinate expression pattern in the mouse uterus during the preimplantation period of pregnancy. The expression of Ihh and its receptor Patched-1, Ptc1, as well as, down stream targets of Ihh-Ptch1 signaling, such as the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF II show that this morphogen pathway mediates communication between the uterine epithelial and stromal compartments.

In fact, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is one for the major building structures of membrane phospholipids of brain and absolute necessary of neuronal function. It was first demonstrated that the differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires not only ALA, but also the very long polyunsaturated omega-3 (DHA) and omega-6 carbon chains. Then, it was found that ALA acid deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the composition of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as sub cellular particles such as myelin, nerve endings (synaptosomes) and mitochondria. These alterations induce physicochemical modifications in membranes, lead to biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and behavioural upset. Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3, ALA and DHA) present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) conditions the visual, neurological and cerebral abilities, including intellectual. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are involved in the prevention of some aspects of ischemic cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The implication of omega-3 fatty acids in major depression and bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) is under evaluation. Their dietary deficiency (and altered hepatic metabolism) can prevent the renewal of membranes and consequently accelerate cerebral ageing; nonetheless, the respective roles of the vascular component on one hand and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other have not yet been clearly elucidated. Low fat diet may have adverse effects on mood. The nature of the amino acid composition of dietary proteins contributes to cerebral function; taking into account that tryptophan plays a special role. In fact, some indispensable amino acids present in dietary proteins participate to elaborate neurotransmitters (and neuromodulators). The regulation of glycaemia (thanks to the ingestion of food with a low glycaemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves the quality and duration of intellectual performance, if only because at rest the brain consumes more than 50% of dietary carbohydrates, approximately 80% of which are used only for energy purpose. In infants, adults and aged, as well as in diabetes, poorer glycaemic control is associated with lower performances, for instance on tests of memory. At all ages, and more specifically in aged people, some cognitive functions appear sensitive to short term variations in glucose availability. The presence of dietary fibbers is associated with higher alertness ratings and ensures less perceived stress. Although an increasing number of genetic factors that may affect the risk of neurodegenerative disorders are being identified, number of findings show that dietary factors play major roles in determining whether the brain age successfully of experiences neurodegenerative disorders.

Retinal mRNA expression of VEGF, angiopoietin-1 and -2, and PDGF was examined at days P14 and P20.\nTNF-Rp55- and TNF-Rp75-deficient mice demonstrated similar retinal development and vascularization under normoxic conditions. In comparison to wild-type mice, the vascularized area remained stable during the observation time, although the gene expression of VEGF, angiopoietin (ang)-1 and -2, and PDGFb changed. Compared with that in the wild type mice, the relative expression of VEGF, ang-1, ang-2, and PDGFb changed 5.14-, 1.7-, 0.39-, and 0.36-fold in Rp55(-/-) mice and 4.1-, 9.5 x 10(-5)-, 0.12-, and 2975-fold in Rp75(-/-) mice, respectively. Treatment with oxygen resulted in a significantly reduced vascularization in Rp55(-/-) but not Rp75(-/-) mice on postnatal day (P)20.\nInhibition of TNFalpha via TNF-Rp55 can alter retinal development and angiogenesis in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.

Using intravital lectin labeling, we demonstrated that development of islet microvasculature and establishment of islet blood flow occur concomitantly with islet morphogenesis. Our genetic data indicate that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a major regulator of islet vascularization and revascularization of transplanted islets. In spite of normal pancreatic insulin content and beta-cell mass, mice with beta-cell-reduced VEGF-A expression had impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. By vascular or diffusion delivery of beta-cell secretagogues to islets, we showed that reduced insulin output is not a result of beta-cell dysfunction but rather caused by vascular alterations in islets. Taken together, our data indicate that the microvasculature plays an integral role in islet function.

Although there has been ample evidence supporting a role for endothelial cell-derived soluble factors as modulators of neural stem cell self-renewal and neuronal differentiation there is a paucity of data reported on neural stem cell modulation of endothelial cell behavior. We show that co-culture of NSCs with brain-derived endothelial cells (BECs) either in direct contact or separated by a porous membrane elicited robust vascular tube formation and maintenance, mediated by induction of vascular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of vascular VEGFR2 and TrkB by NSC NO. Nitric oxide (NO) scavengers and sequestration of VEGF and BDNF blunted this induction of tube formation, whereas addition of exogenous NO donor, rBDNF and rVEGF rescued the induction of tube formation. Further, rBDNF enhanced NSC eNOS activation and NO generation, suggesting an inducible positive feed-back signaling loop between NSCs and BECs, providing for homeostasis and responsiveness of the resident NSCs and BECs comprising the neurovascular niche.

{"title": "Reversion of tumor phenotype in surface transplants of skin SCC cells by scaffold-induced stroma modulation.", "abstract": "Interactions between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment play an essential role in controlling tumor development and progression. Here, we report that stromal modulation induced by a biodegradable meshwork (Hyalograft 3D) inhibited tumor vascularization and invasion of the locally invasive low-grade malignant human HaCaT-ras II-4 keratinocytes in a surface xenotransplantation assay. The scaffold caused formation of an active granulation tissue that shifted to a fibrotic-type connective tissue with accumulation of myofibroblasts and collagen bundles. Most importantly, in transplants with scaffolds, the epithelial-stromal border was normalized developing an ultrastructurally complete basement membrane (BM) including hemidesmosomes. The observed reversion of the tumor phenotype was not due to decreased tumor cell proliferation but correlated with (i) normalization of epidermal differentiation, (ii) condensation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and (iii) reduction of peritumoral protease activity Furthermore, inhibited invasion was paralleled by eliminated tumor vascularization. This was substantiated by a diminished endothelial VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) expression and, in turn, by a concomitant increase in the ECM components thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and endostatin, known to impair angiogenesis. Even in transplants of the metastatic high-grade malignant HaCaT-ras A-5RT3 keratinocytes the anti-invasive effect of the scaffold-modulated stroma prevailed. Tumor vascularization and invasion was reduced and the epithelial tissue partially normalized including formation of stretches of BM. This clearly demonstrates that the scaffold-modulated connective tissue not only blocks tumor invasion but reverts the tumor phenotype.

These \"alternatively activated\" (AA) DC expressed lower TLR4 transcripts than LPS-stimulated control DC and were resistant to maturation. They expressed comparatively low levels of surface MHC class II, CD40, CD80, CD86, and programmed death-ligand 2 (B7-DC; CD273), whereas programmed death-ligand 1 (B7-H1; CD274) and inducible costimulatory ligand expression were unaffected. AADC secreted much higher levels of IL-10, but lower levels of IL-12p70 compared with activated control DC. Their poor allogeneic (C57BL/10; B10) T cell stimulatory activity and ability to induce alloantigen-specific, hyporesponsive T cell proliferation was not associated with enhanced T cell apoptosis. Increased IL-10 production was induced in the alloreactive T cell population, wherein CD4+Foxp3+ cells were expanded. The AADC-expanded allogeneic CD4+CD25+ T cells showed enhanced suppressive activity for T cell proliferative responses compared with freshly isolated T regulatory cells. In vivo migration of AADC to secondary lymphoid tissue was not impaired. A single infusion of BALB/c AADC to quiescent B10 recipients induced alloantigen-specific hyporesponsive T cell proliferation and prolonged subsequent heart graft survival. This effect was potentiated markedly by CTLA4-Ig, administered 1 day after the AADC. Transfer of CD4+ T cells from recipients of long-surviving grafts (>100 days) that were infiltrated with CD4+Foxp3+ cells, prolonged the survival of donor-strain hearts in naive recipients.

The overall incidence of poststernotomy mediastinitis is relatively low, between 1% and 3%, however, this complication is associated with a significant mortality, usually reported to vary between 10% and 25%. At the present time, there is no general consensus regarding the appropriate surgical approach to mediastinitis following open-heart surgery and a wide range of wound-healing strategies have been established for the treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis during the era of modern cardiac surgery. Conventional forms of treatment usually involve surgical revision with open dressings or closed irrigation, or reconstruction with vascularized soft tissue flaps such as omentum or pectoral muscle. Unfortunately, procedure-related morbidity is relatively frequent when using conventional treatments and the long-term clinical outcome has been unsatisfying. Vacuum-assisted closure is a novel treatment with an ingenious mechanism. This wound-healing technique is based on the application of local negative pressure to a wound. During the application of negative pressure to a sternal wound several advantageous features from conventional surgical treatment are combined. Recent publications have demonstrated encouraging clinical results, however, observations are still rather limited and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This review provides an overview of the etiology and common risk factors for deep sternal wound infections and presents the historical development of conventional therapies.

{"title": "Hyaluronan-mediated angiogenesis in vascular disease: uncovering RHAMM and CD44 receptor signaling pathways.", "abstract": "The correct formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature (angiogenesis) is essential for embryogenesis and the effective repair of damaged or wounded tissues. However, excessive and detrimental vascularization also occurs in neoplasia, promoting tumour growth and metastasis, as well as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and atherosclerosis. Greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling the angiogenic process will allow optimization of wound healing, and provide mechanisms to inhibit vascularization in tumours and other diseases. Evidence supports a cascade of events in which the perturbation of one of the steps is sufficient to significantly inhibit neovascularization. The extracellular macromolecules, notably glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are important mediators of angiogenesis. Hyaluronan (HA), a large, non-sulphated GAG, was first discovered in the vitreous of the eye [.], and is ubiquitously expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues. Native high molecular weight HA (n-HA) is anti-angiogenic, whereas HA degradation products (o-HA; 3-10 disaccharides) stimulate endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration and tube formation following activation of specific HA receptors in particular, CD44 and Receptor for HA-Mediated Motility (RHAMM, CD168).

{"title": "Expression of VEGF and pleiotrophin in deer antler.", "abstract": "Deer antlers represent a unique model of mammalian regeneration in that they cast and fully regenerate every year. The deer antler thus provides a fascinating model of both rapid angiogenesis and chondrogenesis and the opportunity to investigate unique growth regulatory processes. One such phenomenon is the presence of vascularized cartilage in the growing antler tip-unlike other cartilage, which is typically avascular. The mechanisms by which blood vessels grow in the cartilage as well as the factors that drive antler extension at approximately 1 cm a day have been hitherto largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of VEGF and pleiotrophin within the growing antler tip. We isolated cervine VEGF121 and VEGF165 from deer antler and found that mRNA is produced for VEGF in the precartilage and cartilage regions. By in situ hybridization, we examined whether the VEGF receptors Flt-1 and KDR are present in deer antler and found only KDR mRNA within the endothelial cells of the precartilage region. This finding is compatible with VEGF having an angiogenic effect within antler. Pleiotrophin mRNA was found in the vascular smooth muscle cells of the dermis, thus supporting a possible role in vascular growth.

Evidence for the hypothesis is based on the indication obtained from our previous muscle xenograft study into athymic nude mice, and the indications proposed by other investigators. (1) The transplanted human muscle xenografts contained the highly vascularized peripheral portions where the active regenerating myotubes were observed; while the central portions of the transplanted xenografts contained few capillaries and scarce regenerating myotubes. (2) Capillary endothelial cells in endomysium contained aquaporin 1 molecule at their cell membranes. (3) Aquaporin 1 molecule is proposed to function in cell migration, which is central to diverse biological phenomena including angiogenesis, wound healing, organ regeneration and tumor growth and spread. Based on these indications the skeletal muscle regeneration may be enhanced by aquaporin 1 of intramuscular capillary endothelial cells.

{"title": "Corneal avascularity is due to soluble VEGF receptor-1.", "abstract": "Corneal avascularity-the absence of blood vessels in the cornea-is required for optical clarity and optimal vision, and has led to the cornea being widely used for validating pro- and anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies for many disorders. But the molecular underpinnings of the avascular phenotype have until now remained obscure and are all the more remarkable given the presence in the cornea of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, and the proximity of the cornea to vascularized tissues. Here we show that the cornea expresses soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1; also known as sflt-1) and that suppression of this endogenous VEGF-A trap by neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference or Cre-lox-mediated gene disruption abolishes corneal avascularity in mice. The spontaneously vascularized corneas of corn1 and Pax6+/- mice and Pax6+/- patients with aniridia are deficient in sflt-1, and recombinant sflt-1 administration restores corneal avascularity in corn1 and Pax6+/- mice. Manatees, the only known creatures uniformly to have vascularized corneas, do not express sflt-1, whereas the avascular corneas of dugongs, also members of the order Sirenia, elephants, the closest extant terrestrial phylogenetic relatives of manatees, and other marine mammals (dolphins and whales) contain sflt-1, indicating that it has a crucial, evolutionarily conserved role. The recognition that sflt-1 is essential for preserving the avascular ambit of the cornea can rationally guide its use as a platform for angiogenic modulators, supports its use in treating neovascular diseases, and might provide insight into the immunological privilege of the cornea.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2006-10-20", "authors": ["Balamurali KAmbati", "MihoNozaki", "NirbhaiSingh", "AtsunobuTakeda", "Pooja DJani", "TusharSuthar", "Romulo J CAlbuquerque", "ElizabethRichter", "EijiSakurai", "Michael TNewcomb", "Mark EKleinman", "Ruth BCaldwell", "QingLin", "YuichiroOgura", "AngelaOrecchia", "Don ASamuelson", "Dalen WAgnew", "JudySt Leger", "W RichardGreen", "Parameshwar JMahasreshti", "David TCuriel", "DonnaKwan", "HeleneMarsh", "SakaeIkeda", "Lucy JLeiper", "J MartinCollinson", "SashaBogdanovich", "Tejvir SKhurana", "MasabumiShibuya", "Megan EBaldwin", "NapoleoneFerrara", "Hans-PeterGerber", "SandroDe Falco", "JassirWitta", "Judit ZBaffi", "Brian JRaisler", "JayakrishnaAmbati"], "doi": "10.1038/nature05249"}

In a single stage, debridement followed by reconstruction using either a muscle flap (n = 13) or a fasciocutaneous flap (n = 13) was performed. Flap donor sites were closed primarily and antibiotics were given for 5 days postoperatively.

{"title": "Non-invasive vascular impedance measures demonstrate ocular vasoconstriction during isometric exercise.", "abstract": "The calculation of impedance for a vascular network is a common method used in circulation studies. Impedance indices (the ratios of the harmonics of pressure to the harmonics of flow) provide the investigator with a measure of the opposition to blood flow in a pulsatile system and are a proven indicator for vasculopathy. Previous studies investigating the eye's opposition to blood flow have concentrated on simple measures of resistance (the ratio of mean pressure difference to mean flow) which are more appropriate to a steady state or non-pulsatile system. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a new, non-invasive, method to determine the vascular impedance of the eye during the known physiologic stress of sustained isometric exercise.\nWaveforms of ocular blood flow and carotid arterial blood pressure were measured non-invasively. Ocular blood flow waveforms were calculated using the Langham-Silver method by measuring the small fluctuations in intraocular pressure intraocular pressure over time with a high fidelity pneumatonometer. Carotid arterial blood pressure waveforms were determined using a SphygmoCor electronic tonometer held over the common carotid artery of the neck. Both waveforms were recorded simultaneously in normal volunteers under two conditions: (1) a baseline resting state and (2) during sustained isometric exercise. The components of the two waveforms (the harmonics) were calculated using a Fast Fourier transform and expressed as a ratio in order to determine a set of impedance values for each condition. The first four impedance values were calculated.\n12 volunteers (six male: six female) with a mean age of 27 years (range 22-32 years) were recruited to the study. In comparison to baseline resting conditions, mean carotid blood pressure and heart rate both increased significantly during exercise: baseline mean carotid blood pressure, 82.6+/-8.2 mm Hg vs exercise mean carotid blood pressure, 93.8+/-12.8 mm Hg (p<0.001); baseline pulse rate, 64.6+/-9.1 BP(m) vs exercise pulse rate, 71.8+/-9.7 BP(m) (p<0.001). Compared to resting conditions, the first and third impedance values demonstrated significant change during exercise: the first impedance value rose (83.9+/-25.6 mm Hg-s/microl to 117.1 +/- 40.9 mm Hg-s/microl, p = 0.01) and the third impedance value fell (487.9 +/- 294.7 mm Hg-s/microl to 248.3+/-206.8 mm Hg-s/microl, p = 0.01).\nThe present study demonstrates, for the first time, a practical non-invasive method of calculating an index of impedance moduli for the pulsatile quotient of blood flow to the eye. Furthermore, during controlled isometric exercise, the impedance moduli displayed changes consistent with that known for a vascular system during vasoconstriction. The calculation of impedance moduli for the eye therefore shows promise for future investigations into ocular conditions where vascular obstruction is an aetiological factor.", "journal": "The British journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2006-10-20", "authors": ["Andrew JMorgan", "Sarah LHosking"], "doi": "10.1136/bjo.2006.098574"}

These data were further supported by the detection of low vessel density in EGFP-positive regions, as determined by the distribution of intravascularly administered, fluorescence-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum lectin in frozen tumor sections.

Cellular mediators as a supplement to bone grafting and decompression is an attractive approach to this problem because it combines the desirable features of other procedures, each of which has shown a certain degree of effectiveness in stimulating bone growth and repair. Basic and clinical researches have shown the efficacy of various cellular mediators (bone morphogenetic proteins, interleukins, angiogenic growth factors, etc.) in healing bone defects. The potential application of these cellular mediators to other musculoskeletal conditions, including osteonecrosis of the femoral head, only recently has been explored. The surgical alternatives may include core decompression, osteotomy, nonvascularized, and vascularized bone grafting, which might be enhanced with the use of cellular mediators. At least three of these factors are potential candidates as therapeutic modalities: cytokines, bone morphogenetic proteins, and angiogenic factors.

Thus, we investigated the effects of hmw-FGF-2 on acute as well as chronic responses to myocardial infarction (MI) induced by irreversible coronary occlusion in the rat. Hmw- or lmw-FGF-2 was injected into the ischemic zone during acute evolving MI. Both isoforms were equally effective in reducing infarct size (at 24 h post-MI) and improving heart function up to 6 weeks post-MI, compared to a vehicle-treated infarcted group. Lmw-FGF-2 alone upregulated vascularization in the infarct. Hmw-FGF-2 elicited significant hypertrophy, compared to the vehicle-treated group, at 4-8 weeks post-MI, assessed by ultrasound, heart morphometry and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. In addition, hmw- (but not lmw-) FGF-2-treated hearts displayed increased accumulation of the cytokine cardiotrophin-1 and its signal transducer gp130. In culture, hmw- (but not lmw-) FGF-2 increased cardiomyocyte protein synthesis and cell size as well as upregulated cardiotrophin-1 released by cardiac fibroblasts, pointing to similar activities in vivo. Thus, hmw- and lmw-FGF-2 exert isoform-specific effects in the heart and only hmw-FGF-2 triggers cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth.

A case report of an 8-year old boy with central hemangioma of the left mandibular body with vague clinical features but a characteristic radiographic and histological picture of central hemangioma is presented here. Also presented is a literature review that includes: (1) clinical features; (2) radiographic appearance; (3) histology; and (4) possible treatment modalities. Enbloc resection of the mandible was performed, followed by the insertion of a reconstruction plate, which will later be replaced by an autogenous graft.", "journal": "Pediatric dentistry", "date": "2006-10-14", "authors": ["NikhilMarwah", "ArchnaAgnihotri", "SamirDutta"], "doi": null}

It also involves angiogenesis inhibition in-vivo in addition to in-vitro human cancer cell growth inhibition study of quercetin and its cyclodextrin complex. Drug-cyclodextrin solid inclusion complexes were prepared and characterized in solution and in the solid state. An in-vitro anti-proliferation study using plain drug and its solubilized form was carried out on human cancer cell lines of different origin. Further, an in-vivo tumour growth inhibition study was carried out using a mouse melanoma model. Histological sections of tumours were examined for the evaluation of tumour microvessel density. Significant enhancement of the solubility and dissolution rate of the quercetin, which occurred after complexation, might be attributed to the decrease in crystallinity of drug. SBE7betaCD complex of quercetin was more potent for inhibiting cell proliferation in human erythroleukaemia and cervix cancer cells. Decreased tumour microvessel density in mouse melanoma after oral quercetin administration led to diminished tumour cell proliferation. Quercetin-SBE7betaCD complex showed significantly improved anti-cancer activity at much lower concentration than the plain drug, providing evidence for dose reduction without affecting therapeutic efficacy when using cyclodextrin carriers.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology", "date": "2006-10-13", "authors": ["RajendrakumarKale", "MadhusudanSaraf", "AartiJuvekar", "PralhadTayade"], "doi": "10.1211/jpp.58.10.0008"}
{"title": "Hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression in bladder cancer and their associations with other angiogenesis-related proteins.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) are closely related protein complexes that activate transcription of target genes in response to hypoxia. The immunohistochemical expression of these two proteins was investigated in 144 bladder cancer tissue samples and correlated with standard clinicopathological features, in order to elucidate their prognostic significance. We also evaluated their possible associations with other angiogenesis related markers such as microvessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factor, thymidine phosphorylase, tenascin, fibronectin, p53 and bcl-2 to further clarify their implication in tumor stroma vascularization. Nuclear HIF-1alpha expression in tumor cells was detected in 57.1% of the cases. A trend of correlation of this expression with poorly differentiated tumors was observed. In addition, HIF-1alpha expression was positively correlated with stromal cells thymidine phosphorylase expression. Tumors that were progressed in muscle-infiltrating disease showed a higher HIF-1alpha expression. A higher HIF-1alpha expression was also observed in tumors with an in situ component. In tumor cells, low HIF-2alpha expression was observed in 6.3%, moderate in 31.9% and high in 61.8% of the cases. A trend of correlation of this expression with MVD was observed. In addition, HIF-2alpha expression was positively correlated with thymidine phosphorylase and fibronectin expression. A lower HIF-2alpha expression was detected in tumors that recurred earlier in univariate methods of analysis. HIF-2alpha was expressed in tumor stroma associated cells in 53.5% of specimens and was correlated with advance tumor stage, thymidine phosphorylase and tenascin expression. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha between primary and recurrent tumors. In multivariate analysis including T stage, T grade, multifocality and T size, both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression were not considered dependent in the prediction of recurrence or progression. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression may help to predict recurrence or progression to muscle invasive disease but not as independent prognostic factors.

To create a new active targeting drug that inhibits the tumor angiogenic process without toxicities to normal cells, human basic FGF (h-bFGF) was inserted genetically into the Gly89 position of cross-linked RNase1 (the ribonuclease inhibitor protein [RI] binding site of cross-linked human pancreatic RNase) to prevent stereospecific binding to RI. The resultant insertional-fusion protein (CL-RFN89) was active both as h-bFGF and as RNase1. Furthermore, it acquired an additional ability of evading RI through steric blockade of RI binding caused by the fused h-bFGF domain. In the present study, the effect of the resultant protein, CL-RFN89, on the antitumor response though its antiangiogenic properties was investigated in an in vivo model. Continuous systemic treatment with CL-RFN89 significantly inhibited the growth of human A431 squamous cell carcinomas in vivo. Seven days of treatment with CL-RFN89 resulted in a 58.2% inhibition of tumor growth compared with control mice (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry using a rat antimouse CD31 antibody showed that treatment with CL-RFN89 reduced tumor vascularization. These findings identify CL-RFN89 as a potent systemic inhibitor of tumor growth as a result of its antiangiogenic properties.

Key to the development of tumors in this model, and in many examples of human tumor development, is hyperactivation of the transcription factor STAT3. This study addressed the requirement for STAT3 activation in tumor initiation and characterized some of the genes downstream of STAT3 required for tumor development. Furthermore, the interaction among STAT3, the microbial environment, and tumorigenesis was evaluated.\nThe role of STAT3 in gastric tumor development was assessed in detail in gp130(757F/Y757F):STAT3(+/-) mice displaying reduced STAT3 activity. Tumor size was quantified morphologically, and the effects on endocrine cell populations, neovascularization, and inflammatory cell infiltration as well as the outcome of STAT3 activation on transcription of a number of genes relevant in growth and inflammation were quantified.\nLoss of one STAT3 allele in gp130(757F/F) mice reduced the frequency and rate of tumor development because of inhibition of proliferation-induced glandular hyperplasia. There was also a concomitant reduction in the degree of inflammatory infiltration and cytokine and chemokine expression, angiogenesis, and expression of metalloproteinases and growth factors. Antimicrobial treatment of gp130(757F/F) mice slowed tumor growth coincident with reduced macrophage and neutrophil infiltration.\nActivation of STAT3 and the microbial environment are pivotal for gastric tumor initiation and development in the gp130(757F/F) mouse, thus supporting the notion that STAT3 activation may play a role in human gastric cancer development.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "date": "2006-10-13", "authors": ["Louise MJudd", "KarinBredin", "AnastasiaKalantzis", "Brendan JJenkins", "MatthiasErnst", "Andrew SGiraud"], "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2006.07.018"}

In this study, we investigated a potential role for PTTG mRNA expression as a marker to evaluate the future clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with primary cancer of the head and neck.\nTumor samples derived from primary tumors of 89 patients suffering from a squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed for PTTG mRNA-expression and compared to corresponding unaffected tissue. Expression levels were correlated to standard clinico-pathological parameters based on a five year observation period.\nIn almost all 89 tumor samples PTTG was found to be overexpressed (median fold increase: 2.1) when compared to the unaffected tissue specimens derived from the same patient. The nodal stage correlated with PTTG transcript levels with significant differences between pN0 (median expression: 1.32) and pN+ (median expression: 2.12; P = 0.016). In patients who developed a tumor recurrence we detected a significantly higher PTTG expression in primary tumors (median expression: 2.63) when compared to patients who did not develop a tumor recurrence (median expression: 1.29; P = 0.009).

Endothelial cells of the pituitary showed the existence of endothelial cell marker, CD31, and of von Willebrand factor protein. These cells in cultures also showed immunoreactivity of estrogen receptors alpha and beta. The angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, significantly increased proliferation and migration of the pituitary-derived endothelial cells in primary cultures.

To directly address the role of host alphaVbeta3 expression in GBM growth and behavior, we intracranially implanted integrin beta3-expressing GBM cells into beta3 wild type (WT) or beta3 knock out (KO) mice and monitored angiogenesis and growth. GBM in beta3 WT animals had a vessel density greater than that in beta3 KO animals, consistent with a pro-angiogenic, pro-tumorigenic view of host integrin function. GBM in beta3 WT animals, however, were no larger than those in beta3 KO animals, because GBM in beta3WT animals were infiltrated with a higher number of tumor necrosis factor alpha-secreting, apoptosis-inducing macrophages than the tumors in the corresponding beta3 KO animals. The tumor-suppressive effects of host beta3 expression could be reversed by macrophage depletion or by transplantation of bone marrow from beta3 KO animals into beta3 WT animals, both of which significantly increased tumor growth independently of tumor vessel density. Taken together, these results show that host alphaVbeta3 integrin expression has opposing actions in the intracranial setting, enhancing tumor vascularization and growth while independently enhancing macrophage-mediated tumor elimination.

{"title": "Analysis of Nsdhl-deficient embryos reveals a role for Hedgehog signaling in early placental development.", "abstract": "The X-linked Nsdhl gene encodes a sterol dehydrogenase involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene cause the male lethal phenotypes in human CHILD syndrome and bare patches (Bpa) mice. Affected male embryos for several mutant Nsdhl alleles die in mid-gestation with a thin and poorly vascularized placental labyrinth. The timing and specific abnormalities noted suggest a defect in one or more developmental signaling pathways as a possible mechanism. Here, we examined the possible involvement of the hedgehog signaling pathway in the placental pathology of Nsdhl mutants using a transgenic mouse line (Ptch1(tm1Mps)) that contains a lacZ reporter under the control of the promoter for Ptch1, the gene that encodes the major hedgehog receptor. We demonstrate expression of Ptch1 in allantoic mesoderm of the placenta from wild-type mid-gestation embryos. The evidence suggests that the signaling is induced by Indian hedgehog that is produced by distal (ectoplacental) visceral endoderm cells that migrate into the allantoic mesoderm before embryonic day 10.0. Using a ubiquitously expressed, X-linked lacZ transgene that undergoes normal X-inactivation, we demonstrate that the placental defects in Nsdhl/+ female embryos are non-cell autonomous. Further, affected placentas from mutant Nsdhl(Bpa-8H) male embryos demonstrate markedly decreased or no Ptch1-lacZ staining and no migration of Ihh expressing cells into the developing placenta. These data strongly implicate the hedgehog signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of the placental defects in NSDHL deficiency and provide evidence for a role for the hedgehog pathway in the development of a functional mammalian placenta.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2006-10-10", "authors": ["FengleiJiang", "Gail EHerman"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddl405"}

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor promoter-based conditionally replicative adenoviruses for pan-carcinoma application.", "abstract": "Treatment of advanced lung cancer is one of the major challenges in current medicine because of the high morbidity and mortality of the disease. Advanced stage lung cancer is refractory to conventional therapies and has an extremely poor prognosis. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Lung tumor formation depends on angiogenesis in which the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by cancer cells plays a pivotal role. Neutralizing VEGF with a soluble VEGF receptor suppresses tumor growth; however, the anticancer effect with this therapy is weakened after the intratumoral vascular network is completed. In this study, we turned the expression of VEGF by tumors to therapeutic advantage using a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus (CRAd) in which the expression of E1 is controlled by the human VEGF promoter. This virus achieved good levels of viral replication in lung cancer cells and induced a substantial anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. As a further enhancement, the cancer cell killing effect was improved with tropism modification of the virus to express the knob domain of Ad3, which improved infectivity for cancer cells. These VEGF promoter-based CRAds also showed a significant cell killing effect for various types of cancer lines other than lung cancer. Conversely, the VEGF promoter has low activity in normal tissues, and the CRAd caused no damage to normal bronchial epithelial cells. Since tumor-associated angiogenesis via VEGF signalling is common in many types of cancers, these CRAds may be applicable to a wide range of tumors. We concluded that VEGF promoter-based CRAds have the potential to be an effective strategy for cancer treatment.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2006-10-07", "authors": ["KTakayama", "P NReynolds", "YAdachi", "LKaliberova", "JUchino", "YNakanishi", "D TCuriel"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.cgt.7700991"}

After visualization of placental surface arteries by a milk injection method, network indices including the number of nodes, network density, network diameter, average distance of nodes, and the degree centralization were determined. These network indices and placental weights were compared with neonatal birth weights.\nThe number of nodes, network density, network diameter, average distance of nodes, and the degree centralization were found to be as follows (Mean +/- SD); 84.7 +/- 29.3, 0.0262 +/- 0.0088, 15.8 +/- 2.77, 7.83 +/- 1.13, 0.0263 +/- 0.0091, respectively. We found that neonatal birth weights correlated with the number of nodes of placental surface arteries (correlation coefficient R = 0.40) and placental weights (R = 0.52) both. However, the number of nodes of placental surface arteries was not associated with the placental weights or the gestational age.\nWe for the first time found that a topological factor, i.e., the number of nodes of placental surface arteries correlated with neonatal growth. There was no correlation between numbers of nodes and placental weights. This suggests that the number of nodes affects fetal growth independent of placental weights. A topological factor of placental vascularization might significantly affect fetal growth in utero and determine risks of vascular diseases in their future lives.", "journal": "[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science", "date": "2006-10-06", "authors": ["HidetoYamada", "ShigekiShimada", "RyutaroNishida", "KousukeYakubo"], "doi": null}
{"title": "HOXB7, a homeodomain protein, is overexpressed in breast cancer and confers epithelial-mesenchymal transition.", "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is increasingly recognized as a mechanism whereby cells in primary noninvasive tumors acquire properties essential for migration and invasion. Microarray analyses of microdissected epithelial cells from bone metastasis revealed a HOXB7 overexpression that was 3-fold higher than in primary breast carcinomas and 18-fold higher compared with normal breast. This led us to investigate the role of HOXB7 in neoplastic transformation of breast cells. Expression of HOXB7 in both MCF10A and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells resulted in the acquisition of both phenotypic and molecular attributes typical of EMT. Loss of epithelial proteins, claudin 1 and claudin 7, mislocalization of claudin 4 and E-cadherin, and the expression of mesenchymal proteins, vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin, were observed. MDCK cells expressing HOXB7 exhibited properties of migration and invasion. Unlike MDCK vector-transfected cells, MDCK-HOXB7 cells formed highly vascularized tumors in mice. MDCK-HOXB7 cells overexpressed basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), had more active forms of both Ras and RhoA proteins, and displayed higher levels of phosphorylation of p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2). Effects initiated by HOXB7 were reversed by specific inhibitors of FGF receptor and the Ras-MAPK pathways. These data provide support for a function for HOXB7 in promoting tumor invasion through activation of Ras/Rho pathway by up-regulating bFGF, a known transcriptional target of HOXB7. Reversal of these effects by HOXB7-specific siRNA further suggested that these effects were mediated by HOXB7. Thus, HOXB7 overexpression caused EMT in epithelial cells, accompanied by acquisition of aggressive properties of tumorigenicity, migration, and invasion.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2006-10-05", "authors": ["XinyanWu", "HexinChen", "BelindaParker", "EthelRubin", "TaoZhu", "Ji ShinLee", "PedramArgani", "SaraswatiSukumar"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4470"}
{"title": "Drug targets to pro-angiogenetic factors with special reference to primary peritoneal mesothelioma.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is necessary for growth and the spread of human tumors. Animal studies also suggest that angiogenesis is an important interspecies biological mechanism of tumor development. Angiogenesis is a complex multistep cascade modulated by both positive soluble factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, thymidine phosphorylase, basic-fibroblast growth factor and negative soluble factors such as angiostatin and endostatin. From the imbalance of the above angiogenesis regulators, tumor endothelial cells may divide up to 50 times more frequently than endothelial cells of normal tissue. Published studies have suggested that the assessment of microvessel density (MVD) or endothelial area (EA) can be considered as surrogate markers of angiogenesis with biological and prognostic relevance. Literature data on angiogenesis of mesothelioma are inconclusive, with only a few studies performed in primary peritoneal mesothelioma (PPM) due to the rarity of the disease. We assessed immunohistochemically MVD and EA and their biological and clinical significance in a consecutive series of 23 PPM cases. MVD and EA were detected in \"hot spots\" by a computerized image analyzer. The mean value of MVD and EA was 27 +/- 14 and 26.04 +/- 8.35 x10(-2) micro(2) per field (400x), respectively. Patients with a high MVD or EA tumors showed a more clinical aggressiveness due to the presence of ascites and a shorter overall survival. Our results suggest that PPM is an angiogenesis-dependent neoplasia. Therefore, antiangiogenic compounds should be tested particularly in those patients with highly vascularized PPM.", "journal": "Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets", "date": "2006-10-05", "authors": ["GirolamoRanieri", "EustachioRuggieri", "GaetanoFalco", "NicolaZizzo", "EliseoMattioli", "Alfredo FrancescoZito", "RosaPatruno", "GiampietroGasparini"], "doi": "10.2174/187153006778250028"}

{"title": "Tumour-stroma interactions between metastatic prostate cancer cells and fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Previous work has shown the importance of tumour-stroma interactions for prostate cancer development at the primary site. The aim of the present study was to find out whether evidence can be found for a tumour-stroma cross- talk also between metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and non-prostatic stromal fibroblasts which are encountered by metastatic cells at most sites. We addressed this issue in cell culture systems using 3 metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines (LnCaP, PC-3 and DU-145) on the one hand, and a human fibroblast line (HFF, human foreskin fibroblasts) on the other. We incubated fibroblasts with tumour cell- and tumour cells with fibroblast-conditioned media and evaluated several parameters important for the establishment of metastases such as cell proliferation, migration and expression of matrix degrading proteases. We also determined in the conditioned media the concentrations of several growth factors and cytokines which might be responsible for the observed effects. We found that media conditioned by all 3 metastatic prostate cancer cell lines stimulated fibroblast proliferation which corresponds to fibrous stroma induction in vivo. DU-145 cell conditioned media induced in fibroblasts expression of mmp-1 mRNA known to be important for tumour invasion. ELISA assays revealed that tumour cells secrete bFGF, PDGF and TNFalpha known to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and/or MMP-1 expression. Cultivation of DU-145 carcinoma cells in fibroblast conditioned medium resulted in an enhanced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of this cell line in soft agar. Fibroblast conditioned medium also increased migration of PC-3 cells in the wound assay and slightly augmented mmp-1 expression. KGF (able to stimulate proliferation of normal and neoplastic prostate epithelial cells) was secreted by fibroblasts at higher concentrations than by all 3 tumour cell lines. In addition, fibroblasts secreted TNFalpha, bFGF, PDGF, HGF and also VEGF, the most important factor for tumour vascularization. Our results provide evidence that tumour-stroma interactions do not only exist at the primary site but also between metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and their fibroblastic microenvironment. These interactions, which are mediated through secreted factors, affect several steps of the metastatic cascade including proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration and the secretion of matrix-degrading proteases.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2006-10-04", "authors": ["AnnetteKaminski", "Jens ClausHahne", "El-MustaphaHaddouti", "AlexandraFlorin", "AxelWellmann", "NicolasWernert"], "doi": null}

Surgical treatment has been based entirely on the evaluation of the femoral side of the hip joint, with little consideration given to the possible influence on outcome of the orientation of the acetabulum.\nWe retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 200 hips in 160 patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head who had undergone free vascularized fibular grafting between 1997 and 1998. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 7.5 years. Ninety-one hips in seventy-one patients were evaluated radiographically for evidence of progression of femoral head collapse at a minimum of two years, and a mean of three years, postoperatively. We defined conversion to a total hip arthroplasty and progression of femoral head collapse as the failure end points, and we analyzed the association of the acetabular center-edge angle of Wiberg, the area and laterality of the lesion, the amount of preoperative collapse of the femoral head, and the etiology of the osteonecrosis with the likelihood of failure.\nForty-eight (24%) of the 200 hips had undergone conversion to a total hip arthroplasty at the time of the final clinical follow-up. In addition, 15% (fourteen) of the ninety-one hips with sufficient radiographic follow-up demonstrated progression of femoral head collapse at the time of the final radiographic examination. Of the hips with a center-edge angle of </=30 degrees , 55% (of those with sufficient radiographic follow-up) demonstrated progressive collapse and 45% were converted to a total hip arthroplasty. In contrast, of the hips with a center-edge angle of >30 degrees , 10% had progressive collapse (p = 0.002) and 6% were converted to a total hip arthroplasty (p < 0.001).

Fgf18(-/-) mice have an apparent delay in skeletal mineralization that is not seen in Fgfr3(-/-) mice. However, this delay in mineralization could not be simply explained by FGF18 signaling to osteoblasts. Here we show that delayed mineralization in Fgf18(-/-) mice was closely associated with delayed initiation of chondrocyte hypertrophy, decreased proliferation at early stages of chondrogenesis, delayed skeletal vascularization and delayed osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment to the growth plate. We further show that FGF18 is necessary for Vegf expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and the perichondrium and is sufficient to induce Vegf expression in skeletal explants. These findings support a model in which FGF18 regulates skeletal vascularization and subsequent recruitment of osteoblasts/osteoclasts through regulation of early stages of chondrogenesis and VEGF expression.

A retrospective review of patients undergoing endonasal skull base surgery at the University of Rosario, Argentina, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was performed to identify patients who were reconstructed with a vascularized septal mucosal flap.\nForty-three patients undergoing endonasal cranial base surgery were repaired with the septal mucosal flap.

It results in severe complications if the orbital content is not supported. We would like to introduce a new technique using free rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) flap with anterior rectus sheath to support the orbital content in a patient who underwent globe-sparing total maxillectomy. The large resection of the recurrent maxillary peripheral nerve sheath tumor was performed in a 34-year-old male patient. Right free RAM flap was harvested simultaneously with the tumor resection. The anterior sheath of upper portion of the rectus muscle was also incorporated into the flap. The free edge of the upper anterior rectus sheath was anchored to three different points: Lateral rim, medial rim and the posterior remnant of the bony orbital floor with non-absorbable suture. Consequently, orbital support was achieved with well-vascularized, thin, strong fascia with smooth surface. Right facial artery and vein were chosen as recipient vessel. Duration of the operation was 5.5 hours. Postoperative period was uneventful. Six months after the surgery, the right eye was in good position without inferior dystopia. Eyeball movement could be done without restriction. The patient also denied diplopia. Reconstruction of globe-sparing total maxillectomy defects with free RAM flap with anterior rectus sheath has several advantages that enable the reconstructive surgeon to solve the multiple complex reconstructive task with one flap: 1) elimination of the secondary donor site morbidity; 2) more simply addressing the challenging task of the eye support than the other techniques; 3) obliterating the maxillectomy defect and closing the palate; 4) restoring the large skin defect; and 5) reducing the operation time. It is difficult to conclude that this technique is the best choice in such cases based on a report of the single case.

Therefore, we performed a series of experiments to test our hypothesis that functional fracture healing is supported by vasculogenesis and osteogenesis via regenerative plasticity of CD34+ cells. Peripheral blood CD34+ cells, isolated from total mononuclear cells of adult human volunteers, showed gene expression of osteocalcin in 4 of 20 freshly isolated cells by single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Phosphate-buffered saline, mononuclear cells, or CD34+ cells were intravenously transplanted after producing nonhealing femoral fractures in nude rats. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining at the peri-fracture site demonstrated molecular and histological expression of human-specific markers for endothelial cells and osteoblasts at week 2. Functional bone healing assessed by biomechanical as well as radiological and histological examinations was significantly enhanced by CD34+ cell transplantation compared with the other groups.

Placenta growth factor (PlGF), an angiogenic mediator promoting pathophysiological neovascularization, is expressed during cutaneous wound healing and improves wound closure by enhancing angiogenesis. By using streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, we here demonstrate that PlGF induction is strongly reduced in diabetic wounds. Diabetic transgenic mice overexpressing PlGF in the skin displayed accelerated wound closure compared with diabetic wild-type littermates. Moreover, diabetic wound treatment with an adenovirus vector expressing the human PlGF gene (AdCMV.PlGF) significantly accelerated the healing process compared with wounds treated with a control vector. The analysis of treated wounds showed that PlGF gene transfer improved granulation tissue formation, maturation, and vascularization, as well as monocytes/macrophages local recruitment. Platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels were increased in AdCMV.PlGF-treated wounds, possibly enhancing PlGF-mediated effects. Finally, PlGF treatment stimulated cultured dermal fibroblast migration, pointing to a direct role of PlGF in accelerating granulation tissue maturation. In conclusion, our data indicate that reduced PlGF expression contributes to impaired wound healing in diabetes and that PlGF gene transfer to diabetic wounds exerts therapeutic activity by promoting different aspects of the repair process.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2006-09-28", "authors": ["FrancescaCianfarani", "GiovannaZambruno", "LauraBrogelli", "FrancescoSera", "Pedro MiguelLacal", "MaurizioPesce", "Maurizio CCapogrossi", "Cristina MariaFailla", "MonicaNapolitano", "TeresaOdorisio"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2006.051314"}

Also, combining the Ilizarov method with microsurgical techniques for limb salvage provides a new use for flaps. A further development in the use of flaps is the application of free-tissue transfers to preserve amputation levels in the war-injured. So-called fillet flaps serve as \"spare parts\" and can be customized for specific recipient sites. The so-called perforator flap makes use of feeder vessels, thus providing cutaneous and other composite flaps without sacrificing major vessels.

Proper regulation of transcription, innervation, vascularization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition is essential for complete fin regeneration. Previous microarray studies suggest that genes involved in ECM regulation are misexpressed following activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. To investigate whether TCDD blocks regeneration by impairing ECM remodeling, male zebra fish were i.p. injected with 50 ng/g TCDD or vehicle, and caudal fins were amputated. By 3 days postamputation (dpa), the vascular network in the regenerating fin of TCDD-exposed fish was disorganized compared to vehicle-exposed animals. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining revealed that axonal outgrowth was impacted by TCDD as early as 3 dpa. Histological analysis demonstrated that TCDD exposure leads to an accumulation of collagen at the end of the fin ray just distal to the amputation site by 3 dpa. Mature lepidotrichial-forming cells (fin ray-forming cells) were not observed in the fins of TCDD-treated fish. The capacity to metabolize ECM was also altered by TCDD exposure.

Many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association of estrogens with breast cancer risk; however, the well-documented immune modulatory properties of estrogen have received little attention. In part, this is due to a lack of suitable models for studying this relationship.\nWe have developed an animal model using estrogen receptor (ER)-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, xenografted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We also generated the ER-alpha knockout (ER-alphaKO) mice on the SCID background and then tested the ability of 17beta-estradiol to stimulate growth of xenografted ER-negative human breast cancer tumors in wild-type and ER-alphaKO SCID mice. We quantified vascularization of tumors, macrophage recruitment to the tumor site by immunocytochemistry, and inflammatory cytokine production.\nWe show that estrogen treatment of C57BL/6/SCID mice promotes the growth of xenografted ER-negative tumors in wild-type mice and this estrogen-induced tumor growth is abrogated in ER-alphaKO mice. Tumor neovascularization of estrogen-treated mice was unchanged versus control; however, estrogen treatment of the C57BL/6/SCID host suppressed macrophage recruitment to and inflammatory cytokine production at the tumor site.\nThese data are consistent with estrogen modulation of the inflammatory response as a contributing factor in estrogen-stimulated growth of an ER-negative tumor.

Since the year 1986, with the creation of the Bone Bank in the University Clinic of Navarra, more than 3,000 grafts have been used for very different types of surgery. Bone grafts can be classified into cortical and spongy; the former are principally used in surgery to save tumour patients, in large post-traumatic reconstructions and in replacement surgery where there are massive bone defects and a structural support is required. The spongy grafts are the most used due to their numerous indications; they are especially useful in filling cavities that require a significant quantity of graft when the autograft is insufficient, or as a complement. They are also of special help in treating fractures when there is bone loss and in the treatment of delays in consolidation and pseudoarthrosis in little vascularized and atrophic zones. They are also used in prosthetic surgery against the presence of cavity type defects. Allografts of soft tissues are specially recognised in multiple ligament injuries that require reconstructions. Nowadays, the most utilised are those employed in surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament although they can be used for filling any ligament or tendon defect. The principal difficulties of the cortical allografts are in the consolidation of the ends with the bone itself and in tumour surgery, given that these are patients immunodepressed by the treatment, the incidence of infection is increased with respect to spongy grafts and soft tissues, which is irrelevant. In short, the increasingly widespread use of allografts is an essential therapeutic weapon in orthopaedic surgery and traumatology.

In vitro, Tca8113 cells secreted soluble FLT-1 (sFLT-1) after infection with AdsFLT-1, and the conditioned medium from AdsFLT-1-treated Tca8113 cells seemed to inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The combined effects of sFLT-1 gene therapy and DDP chemotherapy was then studied in well-established Tca8113 xenografts. The concentration of sFLT-1 in serum reached a peak 8 days after intratumoral injection of AdsFLT-1. In these tumors, AdsFLT-1 intratumoral injections had only a small effect. Interestingly, when the cells were also exposed to DDP chemotherapy, significantly higher (P<0.05), and possibly synergistic, anti-tumoral effects were observed that were highly correlated to a marked reduction in intratumoral vascularization and an increase in tumor-cell apoptosis. Together, these data emphasize the potential of combining an anti-angiogenic gene therapy strategy with a destructive approach directed against the tumor cells to fight human tongue carcinoma.", "journal": "Oral oncology", "date": "2006-09-26", "authors": ["Zhen-NanGao", "Yu-QuanWei", "Pi-ShanYang", "XinXu", "Hua-QiangZhao", "XinHuan", "BingKang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oraloncology.2006.05.009"}
{"title": "Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli induces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor via toll-like receptor 4 in human limbal fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Corneal neovascularization can be induced by a severe ocular infection, injury or immunological diseases. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main cytokine involved in this phenomenon, inducing angiogenesis from the vascularized ocular tissues. As the limbal tissue is located between conjunctival and corneal tissues, we suggest that the limbal cells are participating in the production of VEGF induced by bacterial components as LPS. In this work, RT-PCRs and immunoblots were used to investigate the expression of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic genes in primary cultures of human limbal fibroblasts (PCHLF) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. We found that the expression of VEGF was initiated at 6 h and reaches its highest expression at 72 h after stimulation with LPS. Up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) after 3 h of treatment was also observed. LPS-induced the expression of VEGF in a dose-dependent manner, and the blocking of TLR4 with an anti-TLR4 antibody prevented VEGF expression. We also analyzed the molecules that modulate VEGF expression. LPS did not induce the up-regulation of LL-37 nor the hypoxia induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) mRNA expression, however, an up-regulation of interleukin 13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Ralpha1) and interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) were observed after 3 and 12 h of stimulation, respectively. The expression of interleukin 13 did not change throughout the treatment. These results suggest that TLR4, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-4Ralpha induced by LPS in PCHLF could be playing an important role in the corneal neovascularization.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2006-09-26", "authors": ["SandraRodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez", "Mario ECancino-Diaz", "Pedroza-SeresMiguel", "Juan CCancino-Diaz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exer.2006.07.015"}

However, the deposition behaviour of aerosol particles in the respiratory tract depends on a number of physical (e.g. properties of the particle), chemical (e.g. properties of the drug) and physiological (e.g. breathing pattern, pulmonary diseases) factors. If these are not considered, it will not be possible to deposit a reproducible and sufficient amount of drug in a predefined lung region by means of aerosol inhalation. The lack of consideration of such issues led to many problems in inhalation drug therapy for many years mainly because physiological background of aerosol inhalation was not fully understood. However, over the last 20 years, there has been considerable progress in aerosol research and in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of particle inhalation and pulmonary particle deposition. As a consequence, an increasing number of studies have been performed for the lung administration of drugs using a variety of different inhalation techniques.

{"title": "Endothelial cells assemble into a 3-dimensional prevascular network in a bone tissue engineering construct.", "abstract": "To engineer tissues with clinically relevant dimensions, one must overcome the challenge of rapidly creating functional blood vessels to supply cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products. We tested the hypothesis that endothelial cells, cocultured with osteoprogenitor cells, can organize into a prevascular network in vitro. When cultured in a spheroid coculture model with human mesenchymal stem cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) form a 3-dimensional prevascular network within 10 days of in vitro culture. The formation of the prevascular network was promoted by seeding 2% or fewer HUVECs. Moreover, the addition of endothelial cells resulted in a 4-fold upregulation of the osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase. The addition of mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not result in stabilization of the prevascular network. Upon implantation, the prevascular network developed further and structures including lumen could be seen regularly. However, anastomosis with the host vasculature was limited. We conclude that endothelial cells are able to form a 3-dimensional (3D) prevascular network in vitro in a bone tissue engineering setting. This finding is a strong indication that in vitro prevascularization is a promising strategy to improve implant vascularization in bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2006-09-26", "authors": ["JeroenRouwkema", "Jande Boer", "Clemens AVan Blitterswijk"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.12.2685"}

However, its application has been limited because of its short-term success only. Here we report a new approach to hepatocyte transplantation resulting in the generation of an auxiliary liver in vivo. Isolated primary hepatocytes were encapsulated in isolated spleens and then transplanted by attaching the spleens to the livers of recipient animals (mice or rats) using biodegradable adhesive. A vascular network was rapidly established, and protein molecules circulated freely between the transplanted spleen and the liver, to which they adhered. In contrast, the spleen, which did not adhere to the liver or adhered elsewhere (adipose tissue or peritoneum), did not become vascularized but shrank and died. Encapsulation of hepatocytes in an isolated spleen enhanced their survival significantly, and co-encapsulation of Engelbreth- Holm-Swarm gel together with the hepatocytes further enhanced it. The encapsulated hepatocytes expressed liver-specific differentiation genes for more than 3 weeks. Plasma albumin concentrations in Nagase analbuminemic rats began to increase 3 days after transplantation. The transplanted hepatic cells migrated into the liver parenchyma, whereas the spleen was absorbed.

By using gravity-enforced self-assembly of monodispersed primary cells, we have produced adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocyte-based myocardial microtissues that could optionally be vascularized following coating with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Within myocardial microtissues, individual cardiomyocytes showed native-like cell shape and structure, and established electrochemical coupling via intercalated disks. This resulted in the coordinated beating of microtissues, which was recorded by means of a multi-electrode complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor microchip. Myocardial microtissues (microm3 scale), coated with HUVECs and cast in a custom-shaped agarose mold, assembled to coherent macrotissues (mm3 scale), characterized by an extensive capillary network with typical vessel ultrastructures. Following implantation into chicken embryos, myocardial microtissues recruited the embryo's capillaries to functionally vascularize the rat-derived tissue implant. Similarly, transplantation of rat myocardial microtissues into the pericardium of adult rats resulted in time-dependent integration of myocardial microtissues and co-alignment of implanted and host cardiomyocytes within 7 days.

However, relying purely on random capillary ingrowth into the porous scaffolds from the host may compromise vascularization of a scaffold. One solution is to transplant cells capable of differentiating into new blood vessels into the scaffolds to accelerate the creation of a vascularized scaffold. Because endothelial cells are the key cells involved in blood vessel formation, the present study was designed to investigate the development of a biomaterial surface that supports endothelial cell attachment and proliferation. The subsequent effects of the material surface modifications on the differentiation and proliferation of human bone marrow-derived fibroblasts (HBMFs) when grown in co-culture with a human bone marrow endothelial cell line (HBMEC-60) were studied. Endothelialization studies showed that the gelatin-coated and hydroxyapatite-coated substrates were superior for HBMEC-60 attachment and proliferation to hydrolyzed-only or untreated polycaprolactone substrates. Co-culture studies showed that the presence of the HBMEC-60 specifically enhanced HBMF cell proliferation and differentiation and that this effect was not observed with co-culture with skin fibroblasts.

{"title": "Acellular biological tissues containing inherent glycosaminoglycans for loading basic fibroblast growth factor promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "It was found in our previous study that acellular tissues derived from bovine pericardia consist primarily of insoluble collagen, elastin, and tightly bound glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). It is speculated that the inherent GAGs in acellular tissues may serve as a reservoir for loading basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. This study was therefore designed to investigate effects of the content of GAGs in acellular bovine pericardia on the binding of bFGF and its release profile in vitro while its stimulation in angiogenesis and tissue regeneration in vivo were evaluated subcutaneously in a rat model. To control the content of GAGs, acellular tissues were treated additionally with hyaluronidase for 1 (Hase-D1), 3 (Hase-D3), or 5 days (Hase-D5). The in vitro results indicated that a higher content of GAGs in the acellular tissue resulted in an increase in bFGF binding and in a more gradual and sustained release of the growth factor. The in vivo results obtained at 1 week postoperatively showed that the density and the depth of neo-vessels infiltrated into the acellular tissue loaded with bFGF (acellular/bFGF) were significantly greater than the other test samples. At 1 month postoperatively, vascularized neo-connective tissues were found to fill the pores within each test sample, particularly for the acellular/bFGF tissue. These results suggested that the sustained release of bFGF from the acellular/ bFGF tissue continued to be effective in enhancing angiogenesis and generation of new tissues.

Every neo-tissue construct of clinically relevant dimensions is highly dependent on an intrinsic vascularisation overcoming the limitations of diffusion conditioned survival.

In this study 12 syngeneic rats received transplantaion of carboxy-fluorescine diacetate-succinimidyl ester (CFDA)-labelled, expanded primary myoblasts into a previously vascularised fibrin matrix, containing a microsurgically created AV loop. As control cells were injected into fibrin-matrices without AV-loops. Intra-arterial ink injection followed by explantation was performed 2, 4 and 8 weeks after cell implantation. Specimens were evaluated for CFDA, MyoD and DAPI staining, as well as for mRNA expression of muscle specific genes. Results showed enhanced fibrin resorption in dependence of AV loop presence. Transplanted myoblasts could be detected in the AV loop group even after 8 weeks by CFDA-fluorescence, still showing positive MyoD staining. RT-PCR revealed gene expression of MEF-2 and desmin after 4 weeks on the AVloop side, whereas expression analysis of myogenin and MHC(embryo) was negative. So far myoblast injection in the microsurgical rat AV loop model enhances survival of the cells, keeping their myogenic phenotype, within pre-vascularised fibrin matrices. Probably due to the lack of potent myogenic stimuli and additionally the rapid resorption of the fibrin matrix, no formation of skeletal muscle-like tissue could be observed.

Additionally, we used a fibroblast growth factor-enriched matrigel-plug assay and chick allantoic membrane assays to show that IGFBP-3 has potent antiangiogenic actions in vivo. Finally, overexpression of IGFBP-3 or the non-IGF-binding GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant in Zebrafish embryos confirmed that both IGFBP-3 and the non-IGF-binding mutant inhibited vessel formation in vivo, indicating that the antiangiogenic effect of IGFBP-3 is an IGF-independent phenomenon. Together, these studies provide the first evidence that IGFBP-3 has direct, IGF-independent inhibitory effects on angiogenesis providing an additional mechanism by which it exerts its tumor suppressive effects and further supporting its development for clinical use in the therapy of patients with prostate cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2006-09-20", "authors": ["BLiu", "K-WLee", "MAnzo", "BZhang", "XZi", "YTao", "LShiry", "MPollak", "SLin", "PCohen"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1209977"}
{"title": "Agrin, a novel basement membrane component in human and rat liver, accumulates in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Agrin is a multifunctional heparan sulfate proteoglycan originally discovered in the neuromuscular junctions and later observed in numerous other localizations. The presence of agrin in the liver, either healthy or diseased, has formerly not been reported. We detected agrin in minor amounts in the basement membranes of blood vessels and bile ducts in the healthy liver. The proliferation of bile ductules and the formation of new septal blood vessels in liver cirrhosis, as well as neoangiogenesis in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) result in a dramatic increase in the quantity of agrin. Vascular and peribiliary basement membranes were strongly immunopositive for agrin in 29/29 human liver specimens with cirrhosis and HCC. However, sinusoidal walls of regenerative nodules in the cirrhotic liver consistently remained negative. Given the selectivity of agrin for tumor microvessels, agrin immunohistochemistry may prove helpful in recognizing malignant transformation in cirrhotic livers. Similar immunohistochemical observations were made on the liver of rats exposed to a combined cirrhosis/HCC induction treatment. In both human and rats, agrin probably originates from activated myofibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and biliary epithelial cells. Increased agrin expression in human specimens, in the liver of 4/4 treated rats, as well as in isolated rat liver mesenchymal cells was verified by quantitative RT-PCR. Considering that agrin binds various growth factors, and it directly interacts with cell membrane receptors such as alphav-integrins, we hypothesize a stimulatory role for agrin in neoangiogenic processes such as tumor vascularization, and a supportive role in bile ductule proliferation.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2006-09-20", "authors": ["P\u00e9terT\u00e1trai", "J\u00f3zsefDud\u00e1s", "EnkhjargalBatmunkh", "Mikl\u00f3sM\u00e1th\u00e9", "AttilaZalatnai", "ZsuzsaSchaff", "GiulianoRamadori", "IlonaKovalszky"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.3700475"}

An adolescent with spontaneous hemopneumothorax and shock managed by tube thorascostomy is described here. We compared our case with published data of spontaneous hemopneumothorax in the pediatric age group. Spontaneous hemopneumothorax involves the accumulation of air and blood in the pleural space in the absence of trauma or other obvious causes. Spontaneous hemopneumothorax is usually seen in adolescents, more common in males than females. The common clinical features of spontaneous hemopneumothorax include dyspnoea and chest pain, and 30% present with hypovolemic shock. The bleeding can result from a torn adhesion between the parietal and visceral pleurae, from a rupture of vascularized bullae, or from torn congenital aberrant vessels. Over the last 6 decades, the treatment has progressed from the thoracotomy to minimally invasive techniques such as video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with great reduction in mortality and recurrence rates.

One of the most popular assays to study angiogenic activity is the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Although CAM assay is a vital technique used to study normal and putative angiogenesis, a serious drawback in its utilization is the lack of quantitative assessment of vascularization. In this study, we proposed a new 3-D model of the developing CAM for precise quantification of normal vasculature of CAM from Day 4 to Day 13 of incubation. Image probing technique was used to quantify different 3-D parameters of vascular microarchitecture. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in surface roughness (Sa) was observed at Day 5 of incubation, while highly significant increase (P < 0.01) in Sa values was observed at Day 6 of incubation. Maximum increase (P < 0.001) in Sa values was observed from Day 7 to Day 9 of incubation and slight decrease in Sa values was observed in successive days. Similar results were observed for root mean square values (Sq), absolute heights of the surface (Sz), and amount of lowest valleys (Sy) on CAM. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in developed surface area (Sdr) from Day 5 of incubation, reaching to its maximum (P < 0.01) at Day 9 also was noted. Similarly, significant increase (P < 0.05) in fluid core retention (Sci) illustrates presence of copious fluid in blood vessels. Image probing technique offers a useful modality for visualizing 3-D microvascular architecture of CAM to exaggerate the fine details and reveal the hidden information that can be helpful for precise quantification of angiogenesis.

The amount and efficacy of BM-MNC purified either by an automated method or by a manual procedure were compared. Twelve patients with severe unilateral lower limb ischaemia were entered into this study.

Inflammation-stimulated angiogenesis plays an important role in many pathological diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the suppressive effect of wogonin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced angiogenesis in human umbilical endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures. By cell differentiation assays, migration and tube formation activity under LPS treatment were evaluated. Besides, IL-6 neutralizing antibody was added to test the inhibitory effect in the phenotypic alteration. Western blot analysis, ELISA cytokine assay, and quantitative real time-PCR were performed for VEGF, IL-6, VEGF receptors, and IL-6 receptor gene expressions on HUVEC with wogonin treatment. Furthermore, in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was applied to evaluate the percentage of new vessels formation. The results revealed that wogonin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) inhibited LPS-induced angiogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein expressions of VEGF, VEGFR-2, IL-6, and sIL-6Ralpha were attenuated (P<0.05), but not VEGFR-1. In the LPS-induced CAM model, our data suggested that wogonin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) significantly decreased new vessel formation and vascular network (P<0.05).

This event has coincided with the emergence of a transient and pluripotent structure, the neural crest (NC), which is absent in protochordates. In vertebrates, NC provides the rostral cephalic vesicles with skeletal protection and functional vascularization. The surgical extirpation of the cephalic NC, which is responsible for building up the craniofacial skeleton, results in the absence of facial skeleton together with severe defects of preotic brain development, leading to exencephaly. Here, we have analyzed the role of the NC in forebrain and midbrain development. We show that (i) NC cells (NCC) control Fgf8 expression in the anterior neural ridge, which is considered the prosencephalic organizer; (ii) the cephalic NCC are necessary for the closure of the neural tube; and (iii) NCC contribute to the proper patterning of genes that are expressed in the prosencephalic and mesencephalic alar plate. Along with the development of the roof plate, NCC also concur to the patterning of the pallial and subpallial structures. We show that the NC-dependent production of FGF8 in anterior neural ridge is able to restrict Shh expression to the ventral prosencephalon.

To address this issue, spleen cells from Rag-1-deficient TCR transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a receptor for ovalbumin (OVA) in the context of MHC class I (OT1) were activated with OVA expressing antigen-presenting cell (APC) in the presence or absence of exogenous transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). TGFbeta inhibited the expression of IFN-gamma, granzyme B and the lytic activity of the OT1 T cells while inducing FoxP3 expression in 5-15% of the cells. By contrast, FoxP3 expression was not detected in naive OT-1 T cells or OT-1 T cells activated without exogenous TGFbeta. TGFbeta-activated OT1 cells inhibited the activation of Kd-specific CD8+ CTL responses by normal B6 T cells and the proliferation by Kd-specific CD4+ TCR Tg T cells, but only if the OVA epitope was co-expressed by Kd+ APC. This antigen-specific inhibitory activity, referred to as linked suppression, was neither mediated by residual lytic activity within the activated OT1 T cells nor did it depend upon IL-10 or TGFbeta. Suppression correlated with inhibition of CD86 expression on CD11c+ APC. TGFbeta-activated OT1 T cells also delayed the rejection of heterotopic, vascularized cardiac allografts mediated by anti-Kd-specific CD4+ TCR Tg T cells, but only if the cardiac allograft expressed both OVA and Kd as transgenes. Prolonged survival of allografts was associated with rapid migration of the FoxP3+ OT1 T cells into the donor heart raising the possibility that suppression may be mediated within the allograft.

We have recently demonstrated the prognostic value of cellular proliferation markers in canine STS. Another method of predicting the behavior of neoplasms is intratumoral microvessel density (IMD), which is a measure of tumor angiogenesis. The prognostic significance of IMD has been documented in many human neoplasms and in a limited number of canine and feline neoplasms. To evaluate the prognostic value of IMD in canine STS, we studied 57 STS and compared IMD with histologic features, histologic grade, cellular proliferation, metastatic propensity, and survival. Using immunohistochemistry, the STS were labeled with anti-factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA) and anti-CD31 antibodies to determine 3 IMD parameters: mean microvessel density, high microvessel density, and microvessel area. Using FVIII-RA and CD31, increasing IMD was statistically associated with increasing histologic grade, necrosis scores, and mitotic scores. Higher FVIII-RA IMD values were significantly associated with higher median argyrophilic nucleolar organizing region (AgNOR) values (as previously investigated) and increased metastatic propensity. Fibrosarcomas appear to be the least vascularized of STS. There is no correlation between IMD and survival. Our results indicate that IMD is of prognostic value for histologic grade, histologic features, cellular proliferation (based on AgNOR), and metastatic propensity of canine STS, specifically when using FVIII-RA as the endothelial marker.

Enucleated eyes were analyzed with light and transmission electron microscopies, and measurements of CNV size were done on histologic sections and on isolectin B4-stained choroidal flat mounts.\nPDT induced a light dose-dependent damage to the surrounding neural retina in normal eyes. At a light dose of 32 s, minimal damage was detected in the neural retina, whereas higher light doses caused distortion and disruption of the outer and inner nuclear layers and of the retinal pigment epithelium. When PDT was applied over laser-induced CNV lesions, the relative height of the lesions was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) using all light doses. Transmission electron microscopy 1 day after PDT treatment revealed occlusion of many of the CNV vessels. One week after PDT treatment, the CNV lesions contained patent vessels irrespective of light dose applied. Accordingly, PDT treatment inhibited (p < 0.05) but did not halt CNV lesion growth.\nPDT treatment of laser-induced CNV may create an acute occlusion of neovessels and an inhibition of CNV lesion growth without apparent injury to the surrounding neural retina. However, PDT-treated areas will remain vascularized with continued growth of the CNV lesion, which in turn may explain the often limited effect of PDT in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Elevating the PDT light dose will not increase the treatment effect substantially but may lead to increased collateral injury.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2006-09-13", "authors": ["AnneOdergren", "YueMing", "AndersKvanta"], "doi": "10.1080/02713680600865045"}

Particularly, cells located centrally within the transplanted cell-matrix-construct represent a population with a blood supply questionable for survival. We demonstrated that under in vivo conditions preadipocytes possess the ability to induce and support the vascularization of the implant presumably by expression of several growth factors, such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor). Fertilized White-Leghorn eggs were incubated under standardized conditions. Opening was performed at day three of incubation and preadipocytes with and without recombinant growth factors were transferred into a fibrin matrix and subsequently placed on the Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM), respectively. Eight days later, the implanted constructs were explanted, histologically processed and vascularization evaluated by means of a computer-assisted image analysis program. Matrices containing preadipocytes displayed a significantly higher density of vascularization, whereas in the control group (fibrin without preadipocytes) no vessel ingrowth was observed. Daily application of recombinant growth factors added to the medium did not positively influence vascularization of the implant. Our investigations demonstrate that preadipocytes possess a strong angiogenic potential to induce and support neovascularization of 3D-fibrin matrices under in vivo conditions. Addition of recombinant growth factors did not result in any stimulatory effect.

Only small quantities of low-density vascularized bone tissue have been formed using this method. The authors of the present study combined beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), a biodegradable ceramic, with a prefabricated vascularized bone graft to augment osteogenesis. A saphenous vessel bundle from a rat was wrapped in a biodegradable membrane. Then, autologous PCBM was mixed with beta-TCP granules and packed into the rolled membrane. In the control group, beta-TCP was omitted. Bone formation was histologically assessed 6 and 9 weeks after implantation. The volume of newly formed bone tissue in the rolled membrane was greater in the presence of beta-TCP granules than in the control. Microvessels had formed throughout the new bone tissue. When a prefabricated vascularized bone graft was onlay-grafted to the femur of the same rat, the prefabricated vascularized bone graft directly fused to the cortical surface of the femur, with no intervening fibrous tissue.

Sixteen patients with HNT underwent 3D-TREAT during the CA administration on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Using a parallel imaging acceleration factor of 2, 20 3D data sets at a temporal resolution of 2.3 s/frame were acquired. The quality of tumor delineation, vascularization type, and enhancement pattern were evaluated. Quantitative assessment included measurement of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), determination of signal-intensity-over-time (SIT) curves, time-to-peak enhancement within the carotid arteries and the tumor, and the delay between both. TREAT was compared to conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in six patients. Tumor delineation with TREAT was very good or good in 11/16 patients, and better with TREAT than with DSA in 3/6 cases. The CNR was significantly different for glomus tumors versus hypovascularized malignant tumors with TREAT (p=0.0001), but not on T1-weighted gradient echo (T1w GE) images. Qualitative assessment of tumor vascularization on dynamic TREAT shows good correlation (r=0.75) to quantitative SIT curves.

The activation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents a crucial factor in the process of postnatal neovascularization. BMP-2 protein expression has been detected in several tumor tissues and BMP receptors are expressed in EPCs and MSCs. We therefore analysed the influence of recombinant human (rh) BMP-2 on the function of human EPCs and human bone marrow derived MSCs. Treatment of EPCs isolated from peripheral blood with rhBMP-2 did not induce any significant changes in EPC viability but induced a dose-dependent activation of chemotaxis. Incubation of human MSCs isolated from bone marrow aspirates with rhBMP-2 revealed no significant effect on MSC proliferation. Incubation of EPCs with supernatants of MSCs significantly increased the cell viability compared to controls cultivated with endothelial cell medium. Protein and mRNA expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family member, placental growth factor (PlGF), which is known to be involved in the expansion and recruitment of EPCs, was induced in MSCs after treatment with rhBMP-2. We conclude that tumor- associated BMP-2 secretion might promote tumor angiogenesis by chemotactic effects on EPCs circulating in the peripheral blood and by increased secretion of paracrine angiogenic growth factors including PlGF in MSCs of the tumor stroma.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2006-09-12", "authors": ["MRaida", "A CHeymann", "CG\u00fcnther", "DNiederwieser"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.18.4.735"}
{"title": "Risk factors for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.", "abstract": "Although there is increasing awareness of the important disease burden associated with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the pathogenesis of the disease has not been fully elucidated, and factors contributing to its development remain poorly defined. Although current data suggest that CTEPH does not result from traditional, known thrombophilia or defective plasma fibrinolysis, it has been suggested that levels of Factor VIII and antiphospholipid antibodies (alongside increased lupus anticoagulant), two thrombophilic factors associated with recurrent thrombosis, are elevated in association with CTEPH. Differences in the expression of type-1 plasminogen activator-inhibitor in CTEPH thrombi (compared with thrombi seen in acute pulmonary embolism) suggest that in situ thrombosis within vascularized fibromuscular obstructions may favor the persistence of thrombi, contributing to disease progression. Additional risk factors have been evaluated in patients with CTEPH, including blood groups (which reflect genetically determined erythrocyte-bound oligosaccharide structures) and lipoprotein (a). Certain medical conditions (splenectomy, ventriculo-atrial shunt/(infected) intravenous lines, acute pulmonary embolism, and chronic inflammatory states) have been established as independent risk factors for CTEPH. In particular, the link between splenectomy and CTEPH has gained considerable attention, with speculation that abnormal post-splenectomy erythrocyte activities or abnormal platelet activation may be involved. Although some patients may be genetically susceptible to pulmonary arterial hypertension, genetic variants linked with CTEPH have yet to be determined. Improved understanding of risk factors for CTEPH is an important goal, allowing better targeting of at-risk groups, facilitation of appropriate intervention, and potential limitation of disease progression.", "journal": "Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society", "date": "2006-09-12", "authors": ["IreneLang", "KimKerr"], "doi": "10.1513/pats.200605-108LR"}

After being treated at different temperatures, pHs, and solvent species for distinct durations, the remaining activities of Rg(1) and Re on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation were examined in vitro. Additionally, the remaining activity of each treated test agent, mixed in a growth factor-reduced Matrigel, in stimulating angiogenesis was evaluated subcutaneously in a mouse model. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was used as a control. It was found in vitro that HUVEC proliferation, migration in a Transwell plate, and tube formation on Matrigel were all significantly enhanced in the presence of bFGF, Rg(1), or Re. However, after being treated at different temperatures, pHs, or solvent species, the remaining activity of bFGF on HUVEC behaviors reduced significantly. This observation was more significant with increasing the duration of treatment. In contrast, the activities of Rg(1) and Re remained unchanged throughout the entire course of the study. The in vivo results observed on day 7 after implantation showed that the blank control (Matrigel alone) was slightly vascularized. In contrast, the density of neo-vessels in the Matrigel plug mixed with bFGF, Rg(1), or Re was significantly enhanced. However, after being treated, the density of neo-vessels was significantly reduced in the Matrigel plug mixed with bFGF, while those of Rg(1) and Re remained unchanged.

Interestingly, it appears that not only decidual NK cell/trophoblast interactions are not harmful for the fetus but are beneficial for the placental vascularization and its subsequent development. A recent report has indeed demonstrated that during pregnancy most of the combinations of uterine KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor) NK cell receptors and fetal HLA-C molecules expressed by trophoblast led to normal pregnancies, whereas mothers lacking activating KIR of the AA genotype when the fetus possessed HLA-C of the C2 group were at a greatly increased risk of severe preeclampsia pathology.", "journal": "Medecine sciences : M/S", "date": "2006-09-12", "authors": ["PhilippeLe Bouteiller", "JulieTabiasco"], "doi": "10.1051/medsci/20062289745"}

{"title": "Glucocorticoids prevent the normal increase in placental vascular endothelial growth factor expression and placental vascularity during late pregnancy in the rat.", "abstract": "Increased glucocorticoid exposure reduces fetal growth and predisposes to an increased risk of disease in later life. In addition to direct effects on fetal growth, glucocorticoids also compromise fetal growth indirectly via detrimental effects on placental growth and function. The current study investigated the effects of dexamethasone-induced intrauterine growth restriction on placental vascular development and expression of the endothelial cell-specific mitogen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Separate analyses were conducted for the three main VEGF isoforms (VEGF120, VEGF164, and VEGF188) in the two functionally and morphologically distinct regions of the rat placenta, the basal and labyrinth zones. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that expression of VEGF was markedly up-regulated specifically in the rapidly growing labyrinth zone over the final third of normal pregnancy. Unbiased stereological analyses showed an associated increase in the volume and surface area of maternal and fetal blood spaces, including vascular remodeling of the fetal capillary network near term. In contrast, dexamethasone-induced fetal and placental growth restriction reduced expression of the Vegf120 and Vegf188 isoforms and prevented normal labyrinthine vascular development near term. Most notably, dexamethasone impaired the normal increase in fetal vessel density over the final third of pregnancy, with no effect on the density of maternal blood spaces. Overall, this study quantifies the labyrinth zone-specific increases in placental VEGF expression and vascular development during normal pregnancy, and shows that these increases are prevented by maternal dexamethasone treatment. Our data suggest that glucocorticoid-induced restriction of fetal and placental growth is mediated, in part, via inhibition of placental VEGF expression and an associated reduction in placental vascularization.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2006-09-09", "authors": ["Damien PHewitt", "Peter JMark", "Brendan JWaddell"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2006-0825"}

We will discuss the new techniques available to predict and evaluate treatment response in oncology. The method of reference to evaluate treatment response is based on the measure of lesion size. Functional imaging doesn't evaluate size, but rather a physiological or molecular feature, which is probably modified earlier in response to treatment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced functional imaging of microcirculation follows the biodistribution of a contrast agent and analyses tumour vascularization. Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging differentiates free and restrained water molecules in tissues, reflecting tumor cellularity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is an application of MRI that yields information on the metabolic content of a tissue. It detects relative quantities of various molecules which differ in tumour compared to normal tissue. Positon-emission tomography using (18)FDG is a nuclear medicine technique which gives information on tissue metabolism.

A direct role for KSHV-mediated induction of angiogenesis has been proposed based upon the nature of the neoplasia and various KSHV gene overexpression and infection model systems. We have found that KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces mRNA of hypoxia-induced factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and HIF2alpha, two homologous alpha subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF. HIF is a master regulator of both developmental and pathological angiogenesis, composed of an oxygen-sensitive alpha subunit and a constitutively expressed beta subunit. HIF is classically activated posttranscriptionally with hypoxia, leading to increased protein stability of HIF1alpha and/or HIF2alpha. However, we demonstrate that both alpha subunits are up-regulated at the transcript level by KSHV infection. The transcriptional activation of HIF leads to a functional increase in HIF activity under normoxic conditions, as demonstrated by both luciferase reporter assay and the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), an HIF-responsive gene. KSHV infection synergizes with hypoxia mimics and induces higher expression levels of HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha protein, and HIF1alpha is increased in a significant proportion of the latently infected endothelial cells. Src family kinases are required for the activation of HIF and the downstream gene VEGFR1 by KSHV. We also show that KS lesions, in vivo, express elevated levels of HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha proteins. Thus, KSHV stimulates the HIF pathway via transcriptional up-regulation of both HIF alphas, and this activation may play a role in KS formation, localization, and progression.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2006-09-08", "authors": ["Patrick ACarroll", "Heidi LKenerson", "Raymond SYeung", "MichaelLagunoff"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.00673-06"}

Furthermore, TnI-expressing hepatomas demonstrated changes in the expression of genes related to angiogenesis, apoptosis, signal transduction, or stress.\nTnI regulates tumor growth by modulating vascularization including apoptosis induction and decrease of proliferation. In addition, changes in expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, apoptosis, signal transduction, or stress were found. The upregulation of angiogenesis and stress-related genes indicates a cross-talk of different mechanisms as part of the tumor's reaction to TnI. Because the decrease of vascularization led to lower perfusion values as measured by PET and MRI, these noninvasive methods are promising tools for the monitoring of antiangiogenic gene therapy.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2006-09-07", "authors": ["KerstinSchmidt", "JohannesHoffend", "AnnetteAltmann", "FabianKiessling", "LudwigStrauss", "DirkKoczan", "WalterMier", "MichaelEisenhut", "RalfKinscherf", "UweHaberkorn"], "doi": null}

Subsequently, structural changes lead to left ventricular remodeling finally resulting in the development of heart failure. In addition to an optimal reperfusion and pharmacologinal post-infarction therapy, increased neovascularization and regeneration of cardiomyocytes could reduce or even abolish the ongoing left ventricular remodeling processes within the infarct area. Experimental studies have demonstrated that transplantation of adult progenitor cells leads to increased neovascularization, reduced fibrosis and, therefore, increased left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. In contrast to current treatment strategies, progenitor cell therapy offers a new regenerative approach for myocardial tissue. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated, apart from safety and feasibility of intracoronary infusion of adult autologous progenitor cells, a significant improvement of left ventricular function, geometry and vascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving intracoronary infusion of progenitor cells. However, in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, the improvement in contractility is less pronounced. Finally, whether intracoronary infusion of adult progenitor cells can also reduce morbidity and mortality due to heart failure, remains to be investigated.", "journal": "Der Internist", "date": "2006-09-06", "authors": ["BAssmus", "VSch\u00e4chinger", "A MZeiher"], "doi": "10.1007/s00108-006-1707-7"}

BHMTs were diagnosed by MRI based on the association of a displaced meniscal fragment on coronal images and one of the following three signs on sagittal slices: flipped meniscus sign, double posterior cruciate ligament, and meniscal fragment within the intercondylar notch. BHMT patients' MRIs were retrospectively reviewed independently to search for criteria of reparability by 2 observers with different degrees of experience in musculoskeletal radiology, and disagreements were arbitrated to consensus. The criteria for BHMT reparability were as follows: (1) rim width of less than 4 mm; (2) tear length of 1 cm or greater, regardless of total lesion length; and (3) generation of isosignals by the inner meniscal fragment and peripheral rim compared with the normal contralateral meniscus of the same knee. The first 2 criteria indicate an adequate meniscal lesion length in the vascularized zone (only the peripheral third), enabling meniscal healing after repair; the third criterion guarantees that the meniscus is nondegenerative.\nOf the BHMTs, 5 (17.9%) were arthroscopically reparable and 23 (82.1%) were not. Interpretation of magnetic resonance images correctly predicted reparability in 4 of 5 reparable BHMTs and irreparability in 22 of 23 irreparable BHMTs (26/28 lesions). Interobserver agreement was good for the prediction of reparability (kappa = 0.7).\nThese results suggest that knee BHMTs that are predicted to be reparable by MRI would have a high likelihood of actually being reparable.\nLevel II, development of diagnostic criteria on basis of consecutive patients and gold standard.", "journal": "Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association", "date": "2006-09-06", "authors": ["PatriciaThoreux", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9riqueR\u00e9ty", "GeoffroyNourissat", "XavierRivi\u00e8re", "PatrickSafa", "S\u00e9bastienDurand", "Alain-CharlesMasquelet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.arthro.2006.04.111"}

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways: therapeutic perspective.", "abstract": "The establishment of a vascular supply is one of the earliest and most important events occurring during embryonic development. Growth and maturation of a functional vascular network are complex and still incompletely understood processes involving orchestrated activation of vascular progenitors in the early stages of embryonic development followed by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These processes require a tightly regulated activation of several growth factors and their receptors. The role of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and their receptors has been studied extensively due to their prominent role during blood vessel formation. Mice deficient in various VEGF ligands or receptors show serious defects in vascular formation and maturation. Moreover, members of the VEGF family are involved in other significant biological processes, including lymphangiogenesis, vascular permeability, and hematopoiesis. Importantly, VEGF is released by tumor cells and induces tumor neovascularization. It is now well established that the VEGF axis represents an important target for antitumor therapy.

HA hydrogel film samples were surgically implanted in the ear pinnae of mice, and the ears were harvested at 7 or 14 days post-implantation. Analysis of neovascularization showed that each of the treatment groups receiving an implant, except for HA/Hp at day 14, demonstrated significantly more microvessel density than control ears undergoing surgery but receiving no implant (p<0.015). Treatment groups receiving either Ang-1 alone, or aqueous co-delivery of both Ang-1 and VEGF, were statistically unchanged with time. In contrast, film delivery of both growth factors produced continuing increases in vascularization from day 7 to day 14 in the absence of Hp, but decreases in its presence. However, presentation of both VEGF and Ang-1 in crosslinked HA gels containing Hp generated intact microvessel beds with well-defined borders. The HA hydrogels containing Ang-1+VEGF produced the greatest angiogenic response of any treatment group tested at day 14 (NI=7.44 in the absence of Hp and 4.67 in its presence, where NI is a neovascularization index). Even in the presence of Hp, this had 29% greater vessel density than the next largest treatment group receiving HA/Hp+VEGF (NI=3.61, p=0.04).

We further used a chondrosarcoma cell line to study the effect of interleukin (IL)-1beta and hypoxia on the regulation of ADAMTS1 and VEGF-A expression. ADAMTS1 was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in all analyzed samples from enchondromas, conventional chondrosacromas, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas without exception. In contrast to previous reports on other cancers, we did not detect a consistent decrease in ADAMTS1 expression in chondrosarcomas. Interleukin-1beta stimulation, not hypoxia, transcriptionally downregulated ADAMTS1 in chondrosarcoma cells, whereas VEGF-A expression was upregulated either by hypoxia or IL-1beta. We conclude that ADAMTS1 and VEGF-A in chondrosarcoma cells are regulated independently from each other.

Using anti-claudin-5 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunostaining techniques on brain sections, blood vessels were quantified and VEGF expression was verified to appraise the level of neo-angiogenesis induced in damaged brain areas. Furthermore, glial scar formation and neuropathology were estimated over time in the same injured brain regions by anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry and hemalun-phloxin (H&P) dye staining, respectively. VEGF over-expression was noticed on post-soman day 3 in lesioned areas such as the hippocampal CA1 field and amygdala.

All women underwent estradiol measurements, urinalysis, pelvic examination, introital color Doppler ultrasonographies, and personal interviews for sexual symptoms using a validated questionnaire before and 3 months after ET.\nA higher serum level of estradiol was noted in the oral group compared with the topical group after 3 months of ET.

Regarding the systolic peak, we found a significant decrease only in the topical group (P < 0.05). Although the post-ET prevalence of anorgasmia decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.05), changes in other domains, including the rates of low libido and coital frequency, were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

In addition, ECs growing on the SPCL fibers exhibited a typical morphology, maintained important functional properties, such as the expression of the intercellular junction proteins, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin, the expression of the most typical endothelial marker vWF and sensitivity to pro-inflammatory stimuli, as shown by induction of the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

{"title": "Extracellular matrix of the corpus luteum.", "abstract": "The potential importance of the extracellular matrix to luteal formation and development, additional development in response to pregnancy hormones in some species, and luteal function and regression is possibly under-appreciated. Collagens I and III and fibronectin change dynamically during the formation of the corpus luteum and probably reflect the necessity for directional migration of cells in the establishment of a vascularized corpus luteum. Extracellular proteins may also be essential for the maintenance of luteal cell phenotype. Laminins, collagens type IV, and nidogen-1 have been localized to varying degrees of completeness in different species. Each capillary has a subendothelial basal lamina that changes in composition during luteal formation. These subendothelial basal laminas are often adjacent to luteal cells. The high vascularity of corpora lutea may have led to the assumption that luteal cells are surrounded by basal laminas. However, in rat, bovine, and human corpora lutea, there is no evidence of basal laminas surrounding luteal cells. Instead there are fibers or aggregates of basal lamina material rich in laminins interspersed throughout the luteal tissue.

These processes are dependent upon the precise remodeling of the ovarian extracellular matrix (ECM). Such remodeling occurs both at the level of synthesis and/or proteolytic degradation of ECM proteins. Enzymes known to have important roles in ovarian ECM remodeling include matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activators/plasmin, and ADAMTS ( ADisintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombo Spondin-like motifs). Each of the preceding proteases has corresponding inhibitors capable of regulating proteolytic activity temporally and spatially.

The internal structure of the malleus was examined by high-resolution computed tomography, and solid-state NMR was used to determine relative phosphorus content. The malleus density of the desert golden mole Eremitalpa granti (2.44 g/cm3) was found to be higher than that reported in the literature for any other terrestrial mammal, whereas the ossicles of other golden mole species are not unusually dense. The increased density in Eremitalpa mallei is apparently related both to a relative paucity of internal vascularization and to a high level of mineralization. This high density is expected to augment inertial bone conduction, used for the detection of seismic vibrations, while limiting the skull modifications needed to accommodate the disproportionately large malleus.

The aim of this study was to investigate dynamically whether changes in tumor vasculature implicate tumor tissue degeneration during antiangiogenic therapies. In order to quantify intra-tumor vascularization and necrosis, we have used ultrasound technology. This study has identified essential parameters needed to quantify specifically and sensitively the number of microvessels and the extent of necrosis in xenografted human carcinomas during natural tumor evolution, using contrast-enhanced high-frequency ultrasonography with (HFCDUS) or without (HFUS) color Doppler. We showed that quantification of intra-tumor microvessels between HFCDUS and immunohistochemistry is correlated using an anti-CD31 antibody. Furthermore, quantification of tumor necrosis with HFUS was confirmed by histological examination of hematoxylin-eosin-saffranin-stained sections over the observation period. Subsequently, for the assessment of novel angiogenic inhibitors, HFCDUS and HFUS were used to elucidate the underlying dynamics linking vessel inhibition and tumor eradication. We describe a novel application for HFCDUS/HFUS that constitutes an effective, convenient, and non-invasive method for clinical assessment of angiogenic inhibitors.

{"title": "Modeling the effects of vasculature evolution on early brain tumor growth.", "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of both tumor growth and angiogenesis have been active areas of research for the past several decades. Such models can be classified into one of two categories: those that analyze the remodeling of the vasculature while ignoring changes in the tumor mass, and those that predict tumor expansion in the presence of a non-evolving vasculature. However, it is well accepted that vasculature remodeling and tumor growth strongly depend on one another. For this reason, we have developed a two-dimensional hybrid cellular automaton model of early brain tumor growth that couples the remodeling of the microvasculature with the evolution of the tumor mass. A system of reaction-diffusion equations has been developed to track the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Ang-1, Ang-2, their receptors and their complexes in space and time. The properties of the vasculature and hence of each cell are determined by the relative concentrations of these key angiogenic factors. The model exhibits an angiogenic switch consistent with experimental observations on the upregulation of angiogenesis. Particularly, we show that if the pathways that produce and respond to VEGF and the angiopoietins are properly functioning, angiogenesis is initiated and a tumor can grow to a macroscopic size. However, if the VEGF pathway is inhibited, angiogenesis does not occur and tumor growth is thwarted beyond 1-2mm in size. Furthermore, we show that tumor expansion can occur in well-vascularized environments even when angiogenesis is inhibited, suggesting that anti-angiogenic therapies may not be sufficient to eliminate a population of actively dividing malignant cells.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2006-08-30", "authors": ["Jana LGevertz", "SalvatoreTorquato"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.07.002"}

The PPG probe was applied on the skin over the patella. The probe uses near-infrared (804 nm) and green (560 nm) light sources and the AC component of the PPG signals of the two wavelengths was used to monitor pulsatile blood flow in the patellar bone and the overlying skin, respectively. Twenty healthy subjects were studied and arterial occlusion resulted in elimination of PPG signals at both wavelengths, whereas occlusion of skin blood flow by local surface pressure eliminated only the PPG signal at 560 nm. In a parallel study on a physical model with a rigid tube we showed that the AC component of the PPG signal originates from pulsations of blood flow in a rigid structure and not necessarily from volume pulsations.

Endothelial cells in the adrenal vasculature are therefore a major cellular component of adrenocortical tissue. The aim of the study was to analyze the cellular interaction between endothelial and steroid producing cells, focusing on endothelial cell-factor-mediated activation of aldosterone synthesis. The interaction between human endothelial (HUVECs) cell-conditioned medium and human adrenocortical (NCI-H295R) cells IN VITRO induced a significant surge in aldosterone secretion. The endothelial cell-conditioned medium together with angiotensin II and forskolin also potentiated aldosterone release by 1.5-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively, while preincubation of NCI-H295R cells for 24 h with endothelial cell-conditioned medium enhanced and sensitized the response of NCI-H295R to subsequent angiotensin II and forskolin stimuli by 2.5-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively. The increase in aldosterone release after preincubation with endothelial cell-conditioned medium was sensitive to cycloheximide and KN-93.

Perivascular fibers surrounded all arteries forming a network that was more developed in the rabbit. In humans, intervascular fibers were mainly concentrated at the posterior pole where they formed a denser and more highly organized plexus than in the rabbit, which did not exhibit a preferential location for these fibers.

In the rabbit, these cells were restricted to the peripheral choroid.\nSome differences were observed between human and rabbit choroidal innervation. The abundance of ganglion cells and their preferential distribution could be necessary to maintain a constant blood flow in the central area of the human choroid.

In patients who have it, all local flap solutions to provide skin coverage to the cartilage frame are precluded because of loss and/or severe scarring of the regional skin in association with loss of the axial vascularity of the region. In the current literature, all available techniques for these patients are lengthy and risky free flap procedures that can provide a poor quality of skin coverage with no aesthetic harmony at best. In this article, the authors describe the use of the bilobed cervical flap as a new technique for providing skin coverage in total ear reconstruction for patients with an unfavorable temporoauriculomastoid region.\nOver a period of 6 years, the technique was used in seven patients between the ages of 19 and 52 years. In all patients, the entire skin of the temporoauriculomastoid region was either lost or badly scarred. Moreover, use of the ipsilateral temporoparietal fascia was not possible because of impaired axial vascularity of the region.\nExcept for mild venous congestion at the distal part of the primary flap, the flaps healed uneventfully in all patients. The patients were followed up for 1 to 4 years.

These two groups differ in their direct physiological target, the type or extent of disease that is likely to be susceptible, and the treatment schedule. VDAs target the established tumor blood vessels, resulting in tumor ischemia and necrosis. These agents show more immediate effects compared to antiangiogenic agents and may have more efficacy against advanced bulky disease. VDAs can be divided into two groups--ligand-bound and small molecule agents.

A history of menses abnormalities, miscarriage, or assisted delivery was found in 89% of FD women. Asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia, or both were found in all FD men through seminal fluid analysis. FD patients had significantly higher circulating ACTH and lower cortisol levels than controls (P < 0.05). In patients under ERT, a suboptimal cortisol response to the 250-microg ACTH test was found in 10%, and the ACTH-stimulated cortisol peak was significantly correlated to the health status profile (P < 0.05).\nA variety of latent endocrine dysfunctions, including life-threatening conditions, occur in patients with FD. Endocrine dysfunctions are also present in patients already receiving ERT and are in part related to their persistent poor quality of life. An endocrine work-up should be recommended in all FD patients. Adequate monitoring and hormonal therapy, when required, have to be performed in cases of subclinical endocrine dysfunction to avoid life-threatening events.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2006-08-24", "authors": ["AFaggiano", "APisani", "FMilone", "MGaccione", "MFilippella", "ASantoro", "GVallone", "FTortora", "MSabbatini", "LSpinelli", "GLombardi", "BCianciaruso", "AColao"], "doi": "10.1210/jc.2006-0858"}
{"title": "Allometric scaling law questions the traditional mechanical model for axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer.", "abstract": "To find a quantitative relationship between tumor size and frequency of axillary lymph node involvement.\nThe frequency of axillary node involvement versus primary tumor volume was analyzed in 10 selected series of patients incorporating a total of 57,244 women with resectable breast cancer. The average number of events per unit volume resulting in tumor spread to axillary lymph nodes before tumor surgical removal Theta(V)/V, was estimated under simple probabilistic assumptions.\nThe allometric scaling law Theta(V)/V = 0.0586V(-0.7457) was estimated on the data, fitting the proportion of lymph node involvement on tumor volume V (in microliters). The estimate 0.7457 (95% CI, 0.7200 to 0.7713) suggests that the true scaling exponent, under the assumed model, may be the fractional value, which characterizes scaling relationships for a wide variety of biologic variables at both the whole organism level and organ level.\nResults suggest that the phenomenon should be related to some internal structural trait of the tumor. The vascular network seems to be the best candidate. This result does not support a mere mechanical model of lymphatic tumor spread. A more complex biology-based model of lymphohematogenous spread is suggested, in which the axillary nodes draining the lymph from the primary tumor may become activated by factors produced by both tumor cells and tumor stroma, thus favoring cell-selective homing of otherwise circulating tumor cells. The success of fractal features related to the internal architecture brings additional support to the consideration of primary breast cancer as an organ-like structure.", "journal": "Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology", "date": "2006-08-24", "authors": ["RomanoDemicheli", "EliaBiganzoli", "PatriziaBoracchi", "MarcoGreco", "William J MHrushesky", "Michael WRetsky"], "doi": "10.1200/JCO.2006.05.5988"}

This activity appears to be mediated through the SWI/SNF proteins BRG1 and INI1 and the histone acetyl transferase p300. Here, we report that disruption of the mouse Ss18 gene results in a recessive embryonic lethal phenotype, due to placental failure caused by impairment of placental vascularization and/or chorio-allantoic fusion. This phenotype resembles the p300 knockout phenotype, but is distinct from the Brg1 and Ini1 knockout phenotypes. Through expression profiling of knockout embryos, we observed altered expression of genes known to affect placental development, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein (Pparbp). Since Pparbp null mutant embryos display a similar, lethal phenotype with placental failure, we suggest that the functional and phenotypic co-linearities between Ss18 and p300 may also include the transcriptional co-activator Pparbp. Additional interbreeding of Ss18 and Ss18l1 (Crest) mutant mice indicates that these two functionally and structurally related genes may act synergistically during critical stages of embryonic development.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2006-08-24", "authors": ["D R Hde Bruijn", "W J MPeters", "S MChuva de Sousa Lopes", "A H Avan Dijk", "M PWillemse", "RPfundt", "Pde Boer", "AGeurts van Kessel"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddl235"}

In this study, we verified the proportional contribution of recipient BMSC in the repair process and identified their specific surface markers. Wild-type (WT) donor female heart was transplanted into abdominal cavity of male rat (Group I). In some of recipient animals, infarction was created by LAD occlusion (Group II). Two weeks later, transplanted female hearts were harvested for histological analysis of the mobilized cells. C-kit, CD31, Ki67 and Y-chromosome were used as markers to identify mobilized cells in the female hearts. Y-chromosome positive cells were found in the donor female cardiac allografts. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) of recipient heart induced migration of progenitor cells into the lesions of chronic rejection in the allograft. Donor ventricular mass reduction was more pronounced in Group I. Endothelial progenitor cells induced by AMI from male recipient extensively migrated into the cardiac allograft. SDF-1 mRNA levels significantly increased (peak level at 24 h after AMI) in recipient heart. CXCR4 was strongly expressed in the transplanted hearts around the perivascular area. Spontaneous mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) occurred in cardiac allografts after creating recipient heart AMI and was detectable until 2 weeks. These data suggests that CXCR4 overexpression enhances vascularization in the damaged myocardium and SDF-1/CXCR4 axis seems particularly important in progenitor cell chemotaxis, homing, engraftment and retention in damaged myocardium.

{"title": "Ubiquitin pathway in VHL cancer syndrome.", "abstract": "The physiologic response to changes in cellular oxygen tension is ultimately governed by a heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which, in adaptation to compromised oxygen availability, transactivates a myriad of genes, including those responsible for de novo vascularization, production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and anaerobic metabolism. Accumulation of HIF is observed in most types of solid tumors and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and disease progression, underscoring the importance and relevance of HIF in cancer. The protein stability and, thereby, the activity of HIF are principally regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (ECV) that targets the catalytic subunit HIFalpha for oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Individuals who inherit germline VHL mutation develop VHL disease, which is characterized by the development of hypervascular tumors in multiple yet specific organs.

Therefore, preclinical animal models are essential to help CTA transplantation advance into clinical reality. Evidence has shown that small-animal model (rodents) immunotherapy protocols cannot be directly applied to humans. This study investigated whether a miniature porcine model is reproducible for preclinical studies.\nBased on the concept of vascularized skeletal tissue allograft transplantation, limb heterotopic allograft tissue from a mismatched donor miniature pig consisting of the distal femur, knee joint, tibia, fibula, and surrounding muscle with a vascularized skin paddle model supplied by the superficial femoral vessels was transplanted into recipient pigs. Swine viability and rejection signs of the allograft were monitored postoperatively. Histopathological changes in the allograft tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining if the allo-skin flap was rejected.\nThe recipient pigs were ambulatory immediately following surgery. The flaps showed no visible signs of rejection over the first 4 days of observation. The skin flaps appeared bluish-purple and edematous on postoperative days 5 approximately 7, and progressed to tissue necrosis and rejection on postoperative days 8 approximately 13. Histological examination revealed marked mononuclear cell infiltration and necrotic changes in the all rejected tissues, especial in the allograft skin tissues (skin > muscle > bone > cartilage).\nThe results showed this the porcine CTA model is reproducible and suitable for preclinical training for human CTA transplantation.

Paraffin sections, stained with an antibody directed at vascular endothelium, were analyzed stereologically. The degree of inflammation and the surface of microvascular endothelium per volume (microm2/microm3) were assessed in 4 different layers of the arterial wall.\nThe degree of inflammation and of vascularization was greatest in the adventitia, smaller in the media, and smallest in the intima. A significant positive relationship was observed between the degree of inflammation and the degree of vascularization in the media and in the outer and inner layers of the intima. In 8 biopsies, the microvessels formed a prominent plexus in the intima without apparent connection with microvessels in the adventitia/media, and there were no signs of endothelial budding from the arterial lumen.\nOur results confirm that inflammation is a major determinant in neovascularization in GCA. Some new microvessels are formed by the budding of the adventitial vasa vasorum.

Recirculation and the condition of the nutritive flow is studied. Three hours ischaemia at 36 degrees C will produce only a slight immediate reaction. Microbleedings, thrombus formation and oedema are recorded later. The nutritive blood flow is unevenly distributed. Eight hours ischaemia at 22 degrees C will produce less disturbed microcirculation than a shorter period at body temperature. Tissue viability after an ischaemic insult is dependent on mainly two factors. First, the ability of parenchymal cells to withstand hypoxic injury and secondly the ability of the microvasculature to resume blood flow. Tissue temperature has been found to be a major determinant of the balance between metabolic rate and nutritive blood flow. Studies in the past have utilised the skin of the rat and the ear of the rabbit as tissue models for ischaemic injury (Lindan, 1961; Willms-Kretschmer and Majno, 1969). The aim of our studies is to elucidate the early phase of recovery after an ischaemic insult in the cheek pouch. This tissue is thin and well suited for vital microscopic studies. and pressure may be applied with little shear stress.

A large surface area is created by extensive branching morphogenesis of the trophoblast-derived epithelium to create a villous network, called the labyrinth in rodents. These villi are subsequently vascularized with an elaborate capillary network. Morphogenesis begins with selection of a subset of trophoblast cells in the basal layer of the chorion that express the Gcm1 transcription factor. These cells leave the cell cycle and undergo cell shape changes that initiate a process of involution to create primary villi into which fetal blood vessels grow. Much less is known about the regulation of subsequent events in branching, certainly compared with other organs. However, over 60 different mouse mutants have defects during later labyrinth development. Some of these mutant genes encode components of signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways that play evolutionarily conserved roles in other branched organs, These mutants represent a still largely untapped resource as most of them have not been studied in detail in relation to placental morphogenesis.", "journal": "Differentiation; research in biological diversity", "date": "2006-08-19", "authors": ["James CCross", "HaruoNakano", "David R CNatale", "David GSimmons", "Erica DWatson"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00103.x"}

In twelve patients, the finger injury occurred when working with wood. For ten of the thirteen patients, the injury occurred during recreational activity. The index was involved when only one ray was injured. The thumb was spared in all patients. Joint tissue was lost in all patients. The head of P1 was injured in all cases creating a situation incompatible with fusion without loss of finger length. All patients underwent an emergency surgery for complete reconstruction of the PIP joint with Swanson implant, tendon reconstruction or suture, and skin cover performed during the same procedure.\nTen patients, 16 implants, were reviewed at mean 2.7 years (range 1-6 years). Mean flexion reached 41.8 degrees (range 20-80 degrees). Maximal amplitude of flexion was achieved at one year and remained unchanged thereafter. There were no cases of infection, or secondary amputation. Two implant fractures were noted with no functional impact at six years. There were four cases of instability.\nMost reports in the literature concern composite blast or firearm injuries. Ours appears to be the first series involving injuries occurring while working with wood. Most of the lesions caused by the circular saw were tangential, damaging the dorsal aspect of several PIP joints. Classically, it would be logical to propose arthrodesis if the bone and cartilage loss is not excessive, but with the loss of joint motion provided by implants. Like Nagle, we propose emergency implantation of a Swanson prosthesis if soft tissue and tendon reconstruction can be achieved, avoiding amputation.

Upon perfusion, this lattice is remodeled into branched arteries and veins. Adaptation to mechanical forces is implied to play a major role in arterial patterning. However, numerical simulations of vessel adaptation to haemodynamics has so far failed to predict any realistic vascular pattern. We present in this article a theoretical modeling of vascular development in the yolk sac based on three features of vascular morphogenesis: the disconnection of side branches from main branches, the reconnection of dangling sprouts (\"dead ends\"), and the plastic extension of interstitial tissue, which we have observed in vascular morphogenesis. We show that the effect of Poiseuille flow in the vessels can be modeled by aggregation of random walkers. Solid tissue expansion can be modeled by a Poiseuille (parabolic) deformation, hence by deformation under hits of random walkers. Incorporation of these features, which are of a mechanical nature, leads to realistic modeling of vessels, with important biological consequences. The model also predicts the outcome of simple mechanical actions, such as clamping of vessels or deformation of tissue by the presence of obstacles.

We determined whether there is an additive effect of hVEGF and human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (hIL-1Ra) gene expression in human islets.\nHuman islets were co-infected with adenoviral vectors encoding hVEGF and hIL-1Ra.

Moreover, co-expression of hVEGF and hIL-1Ra reduced the blood glucose level of mice, and increased the level of blood insulin and c-peptide upon glucose challenge.\nOur results indicated that co-expression of genes that target different insults to transplanted islets can improve the outcome of islet transplantation better than either gene alone.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["Ajit SNarang", "OmaimaSabek", "Ahmed OGaber", "Ram IMahato"], "doi": "10.1007/s11095-006-9065-7"}

Four weeks later, abdominal heterotopic DA-heart transplantation was performed on the same recipients. The time-to-heart graft rejection was assessed by the cessation of heart contractions. Rejection was confirmed by histological examinations. Antidonor antibodies were determined by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis.\nThe control animals had a mean heart graft survival of 6.4 days. The free islet groups had significantly shorter heart graft survivals-i.e., 4.8 days (200 islets) and 1.0 day (1000 islets) (P < 0.001)-while those of the encapsulated islet groups were about the same as that of the control group-i.e., 6.4 days (200 islets) and 6.0 days (1000 islets). In the free islet groups, anti-DA antibodies developed in 7/10 (200 islets) and 8/8 (1000 islets) animals after the islet transplantation. In the encapsulated groups, 1/10 (200 islets) and 3/8 (1000 islets) animals developed anti-DA antibodies after these transplantations. All animals had anti-DA antibodies at the time of heart graft rejection. On histological examination all grafts showed various features of rejection.\nThe bilaminar membrane protects against sensitization and prevents accelerated rejection of a subsequent vascularized graft, at least during the first month after the islet transplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["Anne KS\u00f6renby", "Guosheng SWu", "ShunshengZhu", "Annika MWernerson", "SuchitraSumitran-Holgersson", "Annika B HTibell"], "doi": "10.1097/01.tp.0000228912.62374.44"}

Despite the achievements in reconstructive surgery, the failure incidence is high. Infection in the chronic defect region plays the leading role in the pathogenesis. Therefore the outcome of the disease highly depends on the study of the microflora of chronic defects and the choice of optimal methods of infection control. There are data testifying to the fact that the schemes of empirical antibiotherapy which have proved their effectiveness in one country, may turn out to be ineffective in another country. 176 cases of chronic tissue defects of various duration (up to 4 and more years) were analyzed. Changes of the microflora and microbe resistance were traced. High incidence of strains resistant to most antibiotics is observed in chronic defects. The microflora formation is in many respects associated with an inadequate administration of antibiotics. On the basis of the obtained results, practical recommendations are given on the use of antibacterial preparations. One-stage operations and the transplantation of well-vascularized tissues are the principal methods of treatment against the infection in a tissue defect, which are no less important than the methods of choice in treating large infected chronic defects of the body.", "journal": "Georgian medical news", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["IPeradze", "TPeradze", "TNuralova", "ZGoginashvili", "TMosiava"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Down-regulation of the 26S proteasome subunit RPN9 inhibits viral systemic transport and alters plant vascular development.", "abstract": "Plant viruses utilize the vascular system for systemic movement. The plant vascular network also transports water, photosynthates, and signaling molecules and is essential for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms governing vascular development and patterning are still largely unknown. From viral transport suppressor screening using virus-induced gene silencing, we identified a 26S proteasome subunit, RPN9, which is required for broad-spectrum viral systemic transport. Silencing of RPN9 in Nicotiana benthamiana inhibits systemic spread of two taxonomically distinct viruses, Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip mosaic virus. The 26S proteasome is a highly conserved eukaryotic protease complex controlling many fundamental biochemical processes, but the functions of many 26S proteasome regulatory subunits, especially in plants, are still poorly understood. We demonstrate that the inhibition of viral systemic transport after RPN9 silencing is largely due to alterations in the vascular tissue. RPN9-silenced plants display extra leaf vein formation with increased xylem and decreased phloem. We further illustrate that RPN9 functions at least in part through regulation of auxin transport and brassinosteroid signaling, two processes that are crucial for vascular formation. We propose that RPN9 regulates vascular formation by targeting a subset of regulatory proteins for degradation. The brassinosteroid-signaling protein BZR1 is one of the targets.", "journal": "Plant physiology", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["HailingJin", "SongtaoLi", "AndyVillegas"], "doi": "10.1104/pp.106.083519"}

Khaw protocol. NPDS procedures were done according to Kozlov's and Mermoud's technique with SKGEL implant in 18/22 eyes. Intraoperative antimetabolites (AMETAB) were given in 25 eyes (58%) in the mTRAB and 17 (77%) in the NPDS (p>0.05).\nMean follow-up was longer in NPDS (10.7+/-5.5 months) than in mTRAB (8.5+/-3.4 months) (p<0.05). Preoperatively, the two groups were comparable in respect of age, type of glaucoma, mean IOP, severity of VF defects and bleb failure risk factors (p>0.05). Peroperatively, mTRAB were uneventful in 86% vs 90% of NPDS. 1st month postop complications occurred in 60.4% in mTRAB and 77.2% in NPDS (P>0.05). Most of them were minor and transient in both surgeries. Postop early anterior chamber inflammation was mild to moderate in all cases. The incidence of wound leaks (21% in the mTRAB group and 18% in the NPDS group) and hyperfiltration related complications (14% and 13.6% respectively in the mTRAB and NPDS group) were comparable between the two procedures (p > 0.05). Intraoperative antimetabolite application was not associated with an increased rate of postoperative hyperfiltration related complications. Scarring of filtration blebs had concerned a lower percentage of mTRAB eyes (19%) than the NPDS (36%). The number for 5-FU injections was less - although not significantly - in the mTRAB than in the other group (18.6% in mTRAB versus 41% in NPDS (p=0.05). Late complications were not observed in the mTRAB group. Iris prolapse associated with increased IOP occurred in 3 of the 22 NPDS procedures (13.6%). Final mean visual acuity was unchanged compared with preop value and was similar between the 2 groups (p>0.05). Diffuse, mildly vascularized filtration blebs were observed in 84% in mTRAB and 64% in DS (p>0.05).

{"title": "Regulation, function and clinical significance of heparanase in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Heparanase is an endoglycosidase which cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) and hence participates in degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparanase is preferentially expressed in human tumors and its over-expression in tumor cells confers an invasive phenotype in experimental animals. The enzyme also releases angiogenic factors from the ECM and thereby induces an angiogenic response in vivo. Heparanase upregulation correlates with increased tumor vascularity and poor post-operative survival of cancer patients. Heparanase is synthesized as a 65 kDa inactive precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage, yielding 8 and 50 kDa protein subunits that heterodimerize to form an active enzyme. Human heparanase is localized primarily within late endosomes and lysosomes and occasionally on the cell surface and within the cell nucleus. Transcriptional activity of the heparanase promoter is stimulated by demethylation, early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor, estrogen, inflammatory cytokines and inactivation of p53. N-acetylated glycol-split species of heparin as well as siRNA heparanase gene silencing inhibit tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in experimental models. These observations and the unexpected identification of a single functional heparanase, suggest that the enzyme is a promising target for anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug development. Heparanase exhibits also non-enzymatic activities, independent of its involvement in ECM degradation and changes in the extracellular microenvironment. For example, cell surface expression of heparanase elicits a firm cell adhesion, reflecting an involvement in cell-ECM interaction. Heparanase enhances Akt signaling and stimulates PI3K- and p38-dependent endothelial cell migration and invasion. It also promotes VEGF expression via the Src pathway. The enzyme may thus activate endothelial cells and elicits angiogenic and survival responses. Studies with heparanase over-expressing transgenic mice revealed that the enzyme functions in normal processes involving cell mobilization, HS turnover, tissue vascularization and remodeling. In this review, we summarize the current status of heparanase research, emphasizing molecular and cellular aspects of the enzyme, including its mode of processing and activation, control of heparanase gene expression, enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions, and causal involvement in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. We also discuss clinical aspects and strategies for the development of heparanase inhibitors.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2006-08-12", "authors": ["NetaIlan", "MichaelElkin", "IsraelVlodavsky"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2006.06.004"}

In our study, in vitro activity assay showed that the CBD-fused PDGF (CBD-PDGF) and native PDGF (NAT-PDGF) possessed similar activity to stimulate the human fibroblast proliferation. As expected, this peptide promoted the binding of PDGF to collagen scaffolds, and CBD-PDGF caused more cells to proliferate on the collagen gel than NAT-PDGF when the same amounts of PDGF were added. In the in vivo experiment, CBD-PDGF-loaded collagen scaffolds were uniformly cellularized and vascularized compared to that of NAT-PDGF-loaded scaffolds.

{"title": "Islet cell transplantation.", "abstract": "Islet cell transplantation is an attractive alternative therapy to conventional insulin treatment or vascularized whole pancreas transplantation for type 1 diabetic patients. It represents a successful example of somatic cell therapy in humans based on complex procedures for islet isolation from whole pancreas. The islets, that are only 1% of the total pancreas tissue, are isolated by two steps method starting with collagenase digestion that operates a rapid dissociation of the stromal component of the gland, while preserving islet anatomical integrity. After digestion, islets are then separated from exocrine tissue by centrifugation in density gradients. Transplantation consists of a simple injection of few milliliter-purified tissue in the portal vein through a percutaneous trans-hepatic approach performed in local anesthesia. Several studies have now demonstrated that islet transplant can replace pancreatic endocrine function without major side effects and with liver viability preservation in selected patients affected by long-term type 1 diabetes. It can restore endogenous insulin secretion, achieve insulin independence in more than 80% of patients, and recover the metabolism of glucose, protein and lipids. Improved control of glycated HbA1c, reduced risk of recurrent hypoglycemia and of diabetic complications are also seen as important benefits of islet cell transplantation, irrespective of the status of insulin independence.

Small interfering RNA against cyclin D1 was also used to analyze cyclin D1 inhibition-associated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulation.\nThe xenografts treated with adenoviral AS CyD1 showed less vessel density and displayed smaller tumor size in colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and DLD1. In vitro studies indicated that AS CyD1 decreased VEGF protein expression in DLD1 but not in HCT116. Cyclin D1 small interfering RNA caused a decrease in VEGF expression at protein and RNA levels in DLD1. A modest decrease was noted in the VEGF promoter activity, with inactivation of the STAT3 transcription factor through dephosphorylation. On the hand, the cyclin D1 inhibition plus STAT3 inhibitor markedly decreased VEGF expression in HCT116, although VEGF did not change by the STAT3 inhibitor alone. In cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), VEGF augmented cyclin D1 expression and cell growth. AS CyD1 significantly inhibited HUVEC growth even in the presence of VEGF. AS CyD1 also significantly suppressed in vitro tube formation in VEGF-treated HUVEC and in vivo macroaneurysm formation in VEGF-treated Matrigel plug.\nOur results suggest that cyclin D1 may play a role in the maintenance of VEGF expression and that AS CyD1 could be potentially useful for targeting both cancer cells and their microenvironment of tumor vessels.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2006-08-11", "authors": ["MasayoshiYasui", "HirofumiYamamoto", "Chew YeeNgan", "BazarragchaaDamdinsuren", "YurikaSugita", "HirokiFukunaga", "JinyuGu", "MakikoMaeda", "IchiroTakemasa", "MasatakaIkeda", "YasushiFujio", "MitsuguSekimoto", "NariakiMatsuura", "I BernardWeinstein", "MoritoMonden"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1213"}

{"title": "Estrogen induces angiogenesis of the female rabbit bladder.", "abstract": "Postmenopausal bladder dysfunction has been speculated to involve decreased circulating estrogen levels. It is our hypothesis that estrogen induces bladder dysfunctions by modulating blood flow to the bladder, i.e. low estrogen reduces blood flow to the bladder, whereas high estrogen increases blood flow. Our previous studies have demonstrated that estrogen administration in female rabbits induces a 'functional hypertrophy' of the urinary bladder smooth muscle represented by increased smooth muscle mass, which corresponds to increased contractile responses to all forms of stimulation. The present study investigates the effect of estrogen on vasculature density and distribution. Twenty-four female New Zealand white rabbits were separated into six groups of four rabbits each. Group 1 served as controls. Groups 2-6 were ovariectomized. Two weeks after ovariectomy (Ovx), groups 3-6 were given 17-beta estradiol (1 mg/kg per day) by s.c. implant for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days respectively. Blood vessel density and distribution were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analyses. Ovx resulted in significant vascular degeneration and decreased density, whereas estradiol administration mediated a significant angiogenic effect characterized by increased vascular density, and distribution of new vasculature within the smooth muscle bundles of the detrusor. Estradiol-induced vasculogenesis corresponds with our previously demonstrated increase in blood flow to the bladder and increased contractility. The most interesting aspect of these studies is the increased vascularization localized within the muscle bundles rather than between the muscle bundles, which may be important in the link between estrogen and increased incidence of cancers.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2006-08-11", "authors": ["Alpha Dian-YuLin", "AnitaMannikarottu", "Barry AKogan", "CatherineWhitbeck", "PaulChichester", "Robert ELeggett", "Robert MLevin"], "doi": "10.1677/joe.1.06701"}

Islets were isolated from 6-8-week-old prediabetic male NOD mice and microencapsulated in 5% agarose hydrogel. Microencapsulated or nonencapsulated islets were transplanted into the omental pouch of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Although the diabetic NOD mice that received nonencapsulated islets experienced a temporary reversal of their hyperglycemic condition, all 10 of these mice returned to hyperglycemia within 3 weeks. In contrast, 9 of 10 mice transplanted with microencapsulated islets maintained normoglycemia for more than 100 days. Islet grafts were removed at 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 days posttransplantation. A prompt return to hyperglycemia was observed in the mice after graft removal, indicating that the encapsulated islet grafts were responsible for maintaining euglycemia. Histological examination revealed viable islets in the capsules at all time points of graft removal. In addition, beta-cells within the capsules remained well granulated as revealed by the immunohistochemical detection of insulin. No immune cells were detected inside the microcapsules and no morphological irregularities of the microcapsules were observed at any time point, suggesting that the microcapsules successfully protected the islets from cellular immunity. Sufficient vascularization was evident close to the microcapsules. Considerable numbers of islets showed central necrosis at 400 days posttransplantation, although the necrotic islets made up only a small percentage of the islet grafts. Islets with central necrosis also showed abundant insulin production throughout the entire islets, except for the necrotic part.

Current models of islet cell transplantation (release into the portal venous system, placement under the renal capsule, and microencapsulation) lack these qualities. We have developed a model of angiogenesis and spontaneous tissue generation in the rat that lends itself as a potential platform for tissue engineering. In this experiment, we examined the effectiveness of such a model in addressing some of the shortcomings of endocrine pancreatic transplantation. An arteriovenous loop was created in the groins of five adult inbred Sprague-Dawley rats, and placed within polycarbonate chambers. Isolated pancreatic islet cell clusters were placed within the chambers, suspended in a matrix of Matrigel. The chambers were recovered at 3 weeks, and the newly generated tissue was processed for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. By 3 weeks, spontaneous generation of angiogenesis and collagen matrix and deposition of a collagen matrix was observed. Surviving islet cells were identified by histology and their viability was confirmed via immunohistochemistry for insulin and glucagon. This study demonstrates the ability to maintain viability and functionality of transplanted islet cells on a tissue-engineered platform with an independent vascular supply. The model provides the ability to alter the graft environment via matrix substitution, cellular coculture, and administration of growth factors.

Correct management of the internal carotid artery, including preoperative stent insertion or permanent preoperative balloon occlusion, is usually a fundamental step when dealing with these highly vascularized lesions. Because of the tumor tendency to infiltrate the bony structures, aggressive drilling of the temporal bone is also advised, especially at the level of the petrous apex.

The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize chitosan-GP/blood clots in vitro, and (2) to develop a rabbit marrow stimulation model in order to determine the effects of the chitosan-GP/blood implant and of debridement on the formation of incipient cartilage repair tissue.\nBlood clots were characterized by histology and in vitro clot retraction tests. Bilateral 3.5 x 4 mm trochlear defects debrided into the calcified layer were pierced with four microdrill holes and filled with a chitosan-GP/blood implant or allowed to bleed freely as a control. At 1 day post-surgery, initial defects were characterized by histomorphometry (n=3). After 8 weeks of repair, osteochondral repair tissues between or through the drill holes were evaluated by histology, histomorphometry, collagen type II expression, and stereology (n=16).\nChitosan-GP solutions structurally stabilized the blood clots by inhibiting clot retraction. Treatment of drilled defects with chitosan-GP/blood clots led to the formation of a more integrated and hyaline repair tissue above a more porous and vascularized subchondral bone plate compared to drilling alone. Correlation analysis of repair tissue between the drill holes revealed that the absence of calcified cartilage and the presence of a porous subchondral bone plate were predictors of greater repair tissue integration with subchondral bone (P<0.005), and of a higher total O'Driscoll score (P<0.005 and P<0.01, respectively).\nChitosan-GP/blood implants applied in conjunction with drilling, compared to drilling alone, elicited a more hyaline and integrated repair tissue associated with a porous subchondral bone replete with blood vessels. Concomitant regeneration of a vascularized bone plate during cartilage repair could provide progenitors, anabolic factors and nutrients that aid in the formation of hyaline cartilage.", "journal": "Osteoarthritis and cartilage", "date": "2006-08-10", "authors": ["C DHoemann", "JSun", "M DMcKee", "AChevrier", "ERossomacha", "G-ERivard", "MHurtig", "M DBuschmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joca.2006.06.015"}

The authors hypothesize that nerve growth factor (NGF), a well known neurotrophin, may play a direct angiogenic role. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured the effects of NGF on the natural vascularization of the quail chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The angiogenic effect of NGF was compared to that of human recombinant VEGF165 (rhVEGF) and basic FGF (rhbFGF). In comparison to phosphate-buffered saline-treated controls, NGFs from different biological sources (mouse, viper, and cobra) increased the rate of angiogenesis in a dose-dependent fashion from 0.5 to 5 microg. For quantitative morphometry, grayscale images of the blood vessels end points of the CAM arteries were binarized for visualization and skeletonized for quantization by fractal analysis. In mouse NGF-treated embryos the fractal dimension (Df), indicative of arterial vessel length and density, increased to 1.266 +/- 0.021 compared to 1.131 +/- 0.018 (p < .001) for control embryos. This effect was similar to that of 0.5 microg rhVEGF (1.290 +/- 0.021, p < .001) and 1.5 microg rhbFGF (1.264 +/- 0.028, p < .001). The mouse NGF-induced angiogenic effect was blocked by 1 microM K252a (1.149 +/- 0.018, p < .001), an antagonist of the NGF/trkA receptor, but not by 1 microM SU-5416 (1.263 +/- 0.029, p < .001), the VEGF/Flk1 receptor antagonist, indicating a direct, selective angiogenic effect of NGF via quail embryo trkA receptor activation. These results confirm previous observations that NGF has angiogenic activity and suggest that this neurotrophin may also play an important role in the cardiovascular system, besides its well-known effects in the nervous system.

Our previous studies support the notion that there is angiogenesis in ADPKD. We report here results from resin casting of ADPKD kidneys vasculature. In this study, the corrosion-casting method was used in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy to study the vascular architecture and the evidence for angiogenesis in ADPKD kidneys. We found a well-defined vascular network around the cysts forming a 'vascular capsule' somewhat similar to that described in avascular leiomyomata. We also found that the normal vascular architecture is lost and replaced by an assortment of capillaries of larger size than those in the normal kidney, mixed with flattened and spiral arterioles, damaged glomeruli, and atresic venules, indicative of regression of the microvasculature. In the same areas, there was capillary sprouting, considered the hallmark of angiogenesis.

Vascularization of tumor tissue by the host is a prerequisite for tumor growth, which has led to the development of antiangiogenic therapy. This promising anti-cancer therapy intends to reduce, halt, or even regress tumor growth by deprivation from blood, oxygen, and nutrient supply. Confrontation cultures of human embryonic stem cells with multicellular tumor spheroids allow the investigation of the time course of endothelial cell invasion into the tumor tissue, the concomitant analysis of changes in angiogenesis-related gene expression, and analysis of the cellular microenvironment (i.e., pericellular oxygen pressure, tissue pH, and levels of tissue reactive oxygen species). The in vitro model of confrontation cultures is suitable for routine screening of antiangiogenic agents in pre-clinical trials and may be used to replace animal experiments applied in antiangiogenesis research.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2006-08-03", "authors": ["MariaWartenberg", "AndreasFinkensieper", "J\u00fcrgenHescheler", "HeinrichSauer"], "doi": "10.1385/1-59745-046-4:313"}
{"title": "Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by primary human fibroblasts at senescence.", "abstract": "Cellular senescence prevents the proliferation of cells at risk for neoplastic transformation. Nonetheless, the senescence response is thought to be antagonistically pleiotropic and thus contribute to aging phenotypes, including, ironically, late life cancers. The cancer-promoting activity of senescent cells is likely due to secreted molecules, the identity of which remains largely unknown. Here, we have shown that senescent fibroblasts, much more than presenescent fibroblasts, stimulate tumor vascularization in mice. Weakly malignant epithelial cells co-injected with senescent fibroblasts had larger and greater numbers of blood vessels compared with controls. Accordingly, increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was a frequent characteristic of senescent human and mouse fibroblasts in culture. Importantly, conditioned medium from senescent fibroblasts, more than medium from presenescent cells, stimulates cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to invade a basement membrane, a hallmark of angiogenesis. Increased VEGF expression was specific to the senescent phenotype and increased whether senescence was induced by replicative exhaustion, overexpression of p16(Ink4a), or overexpression of oncogenic RAS. The senescence-dependent increase in VEGF production was accompanied by very little increase in hypoxic-inducible (transcription) factor 1 alpha protein levels, and hypoxia further induced VEGF in senescent cells. This result suggests the rise in VEGF expression at senescence is not a hypoxic response. Our findings may in part explain why senescent cells stimulate tumorigenesis in vivo and support the idea that senescent cells may facilitate age-associated cancer development by secreting factors that promote malignant progression.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2006-08-02", "authors": ["Jean-PhilippeCopp\u00e9", "KatalinKauser", "JudithCampisi", "Christian MBeaus\u00e9jour"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M603307200"}

All three genetic lesions are potentially pro-angiogenic, as they sustain production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Yet Kras-transformed mouse colonocytes lacking p53 formed indolent, poorly vascularized tumors, whereas additional transduction with a Myc-encoding retrovirus promoted vigorous vascularization and growth. In addition, VEGF levels were unaffected by Myc, but enhanced neovascularization correlated with downregulation of anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (Tsp1) and related proteins, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Both Tsp1 and CTGF are predicted targets for repression by the miR-17-92 microRNA cluster, which was upregulated in colonocytes coexpressing K-Ras and c-Myc. Indeed, miR-17-92 knockdown with antisense 2'-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides partly restored Tsp1 and CTGF expression; in addition, transduction of Ras-only cells with a miR-17-92-encoding retrovirus reduced Tsp1 and CTGF levels.

The authors investigated whether microglia are implicated in retinal blood vessel formation.\nThe microglia and vasculature of developing human fetal and rodent retinas were examined by labeling the endothelial cells with lectin and the microglia with CD18 antibody or green fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of the chemokine receptor CX(3)CR1. Rodent ischemic proliferative retinopathy induced by hyperoxia or hypercapnia, which model retinopathy of prematurity, and ex vivo retinal explants were used to assess microglial involvement in vascular pathology. Microglial participation in developmental retinal vessel formation was further studied in neonatal rats after pharmacologic macrophage depletion with the use of clodronate liposomes and subsequent intravitreal injection of microglia.\nMicroglia intimately appose developing vessels of human and murine retinas. Ischemic retinopathy models exhibit decreased microglia concomitant with the characteristic reductions in vasculature observed in these retinopathies. Retinal explants exposed to conditions resulting in ischemic retinopathies (in vivo) reveal that antioxidants protect against microglial loss. Depletion of resident retinal microglia, but not systemic macrophages, reduced developmental vessel growth and density, which were restored by intravitreal microglial injection.\nThese observations suggest that proper retinal blood vessel formation requires an adequate resident microglial population because diminished microglia are associated with decreased vascularity in models of ischemic retinopathy and retinal vascular development.

Tumor vessel area was increased in transgenic mice as compared to controls. Augmented mobilization of endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow was observed in transgenic animals, possibly contributing to tumor vascularization. The number and size of pulmonary metastases were significantly higher in transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates.

We apply this idea at the avascular level to develop a model for the remote suppression of secondary avascular tumors via the secretion of primary avascular tumor inhibitors. The model gives good agreement with the observations of [De Giorgi et al., 2003, Derm. Surgery 29, 664-667]. These authors reported on the emergence of a polypoid melanoma at a site remote from a primary polypoid melanoma after excision of the latter. The authors observed no recurrence of the melanoma at the primary site, but did observe secondary tumors at secondary sites 5-7 cm from the primary site within a period of 1 month after the excision of the primary site. We attempt to provide a reasonable biochemical/cell biological model for this phenomenon. We show that when the tumors are sufficiently remote, the primary tumor will not influence the secondary tumor while, if they are too close together, the primary tumor can effectively prevent the growth of the secondary tumor, even after it is removed.

One of these reticulate mutants was named reticulata (re) by R\u00e9dei in 1964 and has been used for years as a classical genetic marker for linkage analysis. Seven recessive alleles of the RE gene were studied, at least four of which seem to be null. Contrary to many other leaf mutants studied in Arabidopsis, very little pleiotropy was observed in the external morphology of the re mutants, whose only aberration obvious at first sight is the reticulation exhibited by cotyledons and leaves. The re alleles caused a marked reduction in the density of mesophyll cells in interveinal regions of the leaf, which does not result from perturbed plastid development in specific cells, but rather from a dramatic change in internal leaf architecture. Loss of function of the RE gene seems to specifically perturb mesophyll cell division in the early stages of leaf organogenesis. The leaves of re mutants were nearly normal in shape in spite of their extremely reduced mesophyll cell density, suggesting that the epidermis plays a major role in regulating leaf shape in Arabidopsis. The RE gene was positionally cloned and found to be expressed in all the major organs studied. RE encodes a protein of unknown function and is identical to the LCD1 gene, which was identified based on the increased sensitivity to ozone caused by its mutant allele lcd1-1.

In this study, we used a gene therapy approach to investigate the role of IL-4 in angiogenesis in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), a model for rheumatoid arthritis.\nRats received an adenovirus producing IL-4 (AxCAIL-4), a control virus without insert, or control vehicle (phosphate buffered saline) intraarticularly before arthritis onset. At peak onset of arthritis, rats were killed. Vascularization was determined in the synovial tissue, and correlations with inflammation were assessed. Ankle homogenates were used in angiogenesis assays in vitro and in vivo, and protein levels of cytokines and growth factors were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synovial tissue expression of alphav integrins was determined by immunohistochemistry.\nIL-4 induced a reduction in synovial tissue vessel density, which was paralleled by a decrease in inflammation. AxCAIL-4 joint homogenates significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited both endothelial cell (EC) migration and tube formation in vitro. Similarly, AxCAIL-4 inhibited capillary sprouting in the rat aortic ring assay, and vessel growth in the in vivo Matrigel plug assay. The angiostatic effect occurred despite high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and was associated with down-regulation of the proangiogenic cytokines IL-18, CXCL16, and CXCL5 and up-regulation of the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin. Of interest, AxCAIL-4 also resulted in decreased EC expression of the alphav and beta3 integrin chains.\nIn rat AIA, IL-4 reduces synovial tissue vascularization via angiostatic effects, mediates inhibition of angiogenesis via an association with altered pro- and antiangiogenic cytokines, and may inhibit VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and exert its angiostatic role in part via alphavbeta3 integrin.

Additionally, anatomical properties of the ear canal may increase the difficulty of aiming the thermometer at the eardrum. Furthermore, the rich vascularization, innervation and variations in skin properties (thickness, oil secretion and hair) along the length of the ear canal affect the black body-like nature of the structure. It is concluded that such factors are more likely underlying reasons for the difficulties in reliably reproducing temperatures from this site.

{"title": "Chronic stress promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model of ovarian carcinoma.", "abstract": "Stress can alter immunological, neurochemical and endocrinological functions, but its role in cancer progression is not well understood. Here, we show that chronic behavioral stress results in higher levels of tissue catecholamines, greater tumor burden and more invasive growth of ovarian carcinoma cells in an orthotopic mouse model. These effects are mediated primarily through activation of the tumor cell cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway by the beta(2) adrenergic receptor (encoded by ADRB2). Tumors in stressed animals showed markedly increased vascularization and enhanced expression of VEGF, MMP2 and MMP9, and we found that angiogenic processes mediated the effects of stress on tumor growth in vivo. These data identify beta-adrenergic activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway as a major mechanism by which behavioral stress can enhance tumor angiogenesis in vivo and thereby promote malignant cell growth.

{"title": "UPR activation alters chemosensitivity of tumor cells.", "abstract": "A growing body of literature demonstrates that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in a number of tumors. Recent data suggests that the UPR may play a role in protecting transformed cells from the inadequate environment that exists prior to vascularization and therefore contribute to tumor growth and survival. In addition, data from cell culture based studies demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the UPR can alter the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic agents, making them either more sensitive in some cases or more resistant in others. Thus, it will be important to understand and integrate data on the role of the UPR in tumor growth and survival with studies on the effects of UPR activation on chemosensitivity before considering therapeutic interventions into this signaling pathway.", "journal": "Cancer biology & therapy", "date": "2006-07-25", "authors": ["Melissa JMann", "Linda MHendershot"], "doi": "10.4161/cbt.5.7.2969"}

Thus, alternative therapy strategies are needed. Malignant gliomas are upon the best vascularized tumors in humans and their proliferation is hallmarked by a distinct proliferative vascular component. Hence it seems to be a logical consequence to apply anti-angiogenic treatment strategies to malignant gliomas. These treatment strategies have shown promising effects in animal models and some experimental clinical studies. This review gives a short introduction into the molecules involved in angiogenesis of malignant gliomas, it provides an overview of the latest experimental developments of glioma angiogenesis inhibition and discusses the results of clinical anti-angiogenic trials in patients with high grade glioma.

{"title": "The genetics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.", "abstract": "Over the last 15 years, neonatal morbidity and mortality has changed little for very low birth weight babies despite significant technological and therapeutic advances. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a major problem despite antenatal steroid use, surfactant replacement therapy, gentle noninvasive ventilation techniques, permissive hypercarbia, and judicious use of oxygen. Current evidence supports multiple contributing factors. Prematurity is the cardinal factor; others include pulmonary baro/volutrauma, hyperoxia, and inflammation. BPD is an end product of pulmonary inflammatory response and lung repair with impaired alveolarization and vascularization in response to lung injury. These sequences involve multiple morphoregulatory molecules, which have a range of activities largely determined by genetic variability. A clearer understanding of genetic susceptibility for BPD has recently emerged. Twin studies have shown that the BPD status of one twin, even after correcting for contributing factors, is a highly significant predictor of BPD in the second twin. After controlling for covariates, genetic factors account for 53% (P = 0.004, 95% CI = 16%-89%) of the variance in liability for BPD. Incremental improvements will likely depend on identification of these genetic components for targeting specific therapies.", "journal": "Seminars in perinatology", "date": "2006-07-25", "authors": ["VineetBhandari", "Jeffrey RGruen"], "doi": "10.1053/j.semperi.2006.05.005"}

The relationship between endochondral ossification and vascularization is important in bone formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered to play an important role in this process. In this study, the immunohistological localization of VEGF was investigated in rhBMP-2-induced ectopic endochondral ossification in the calf muscle of rats. In addition, the characteristics of anti-VEGF antibody-reactive cells were histologically investigated using electron microscopy to examine the cause of endochondral ossification induced by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. The role of VEGF in rhBMP-2-induced osteoinduction and vascular induction was studied by observing the relationship between the localizations of anti-VEGF antibody-reactive cells and vascularization. During the process of rhBMP-2-induced ectopic endochondral ossification, fibroblast-like cells, which were located at the margin of the implant and reactive to BMP-2 at 5 days, were positive for VEGF immunostaining. Hypertrophic chondrocytes appeared 9 days and osteoblasts appeared 14 to 21 days after implantation, and all these cells were reactive with anti-VEGF antibody. Bony trabeculae subsequently appeared in the muscle, and new blood vessels were formed alongside the trabeculae. When VEGF was added to rhBMP, more new blood vessels and bone were formed in the induced bone. These findings suggested that rhBMP-2 induced the differentiation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and these differentiated cells expressed VEGF, creating an advantageous environment for vascularization in bony tissue.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2006-07-22", "authors": ["NatsukoKakudo", "KenjiKusumoto", "Yi BiaoWang", "YukoIguchi", "YutakaOgawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2006.06.033"}

For this purpose the functional anatomy and origin of the notochord turgor was analysed in 10 species macroscopically and using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The notochord consists of the fibrous notochord sheath, which surrounds the notochord cells. Within the sheath these cells form a net-like unit. The inner cells are derived from the marginal notochord cells (chordoblasts). They are protected from mechanical overload by intracellular filaments and desmosomes. Due to their vacuoles, which are filled with a hyaline liquid, they have a constant volume but are deformable. Dissolved substances may pass from the vascularized fin to the notochord cells. The transport from marginal to inner cells occurs via cytopempsis and micropinocytosis. The morphological correlation of this process consists of multiple membrane invaginations and intracellular vesicles. Within the notochord cells a high turgor pressure has been observed. During metamorphosis the membrane vesiculation persists and the notochord cells degenerate. Due to the loss of turgor pressure the tight consistency of the notochord is lost. The collagen filaments and the elastic membrane of the notochord sheath dissolve. Notochord cells with their filaments, high turgor pressure and their central vacuole can function as a combined mechanical and physiological system, which is adaptable to the needs of pressure, compression, tensile and bending forces.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2006-07-22", "authors": ["FranzPlatz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2006.01.009"}
{"title": "The fate of folded and unfolded dermal grafts: a histopathologic and structural study of rabbits.", "abstract": "Currently, both autogenous and nonautogenous materials are used to treat contour deformities. Autogenous grafts are preferable to nonautogenous grafts because they cause less reaction and are both inexpensive and easy to obtain. Currently, however, no consensus exists on an ideal autogenous graft. As autogenous materials, dermal grafts can be obtained from scar tissue, allowing simultaneous revision of scars, quicker vascularization than with other autogenous tissues, and a very short immobilization for their stabilization (i.e., they interact with surrounding tissues). The operation can be performed with the patient under local anesthesia, providing regular contours easily. Alternative techniques are needed to increase the viability and mass effects of autogenous grafts in the long term. With this as the objective, folded dermal grafts were used to increase the mass effects of dermal grafts. The current study compared long-term histopathologic and structural changes in unfolded and folded dermal autogenous grafts used for correction of soft tissue contour deformities. Thicknesses and histopathologic changes of the unfolded and folded dermal autogenous grafts were evaluated 6 and 12 months after placement of the grafts in the abdomens of 10 rabbits. Both the authors' observations and histopathologic examinations showed that the folded dermis caused a more severe granulomatous reaction and fibrosis. Graft thicknesses considerably increased in the first 6 months, but then almost leveled off in the following months. Increased fibrosis in the folded grafts had a masslike effect, which was preserved in the long term, suggesting that folded dermal grafts can be used clinically.", "journal": "Aesthetic plastic surgery", "date": "2006-07-21", "authors": ["B AsumanSevin", "GokhanAdanali", "MacideYakut", "OrgunDeren", "DilekSenen", "BulentErdogan", "KutluSevin"], "doi": "10.1007/s00266-005-0211-0"}

EPCs in tumor samples were identified by confocal microscopy using CD31, CD34, CD133, and VEGFR2 antibodies. Although immunofluorescent labeling of microvessels made clear that incorporation of EPCs is a rare phenomenon in NSCLC tissue (9 of 22 cases), circulating EPC levels before therapeutic intervention were increased in NSCLC patients (P < 0.002, versus healthy controls), and high pretreatment circulating EPC numbers correlated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). Furthermore, in the subgroup of responders to treatment, the posttreatment EPC numbers in the peripheral blood were significantly lower compared with nonresponding patients. Interestingly, pretreatment mRNA levels of CD133, VE-cadherin, and CD34 were not significantly increased in NSCLC patients, whereas VEGFR2 expression was increased by 80-fold.

The presence of versican in the extracellular matrix plays a role in tumor cell growth, adhesion and migration, which could be altered by altering the ratio between versican isoforms. We have previously shown that overexpression of the V3 isoform of versican in human melanoma cell lines markedly reduces cell growth in vitro and in vivo, since V3-overexpressing (LV3SN) cultured cells as well as primary tumors arising from these cells grow slower than their vector-only counterparts (LXSN). In the present work, we have extended these observations to demonstrate that the delayed cell growth is due to multiple events since differences in proliferative index as well as in apoptosis are observed in LV3SN cells and tumors compared to LXSN. For example, LV3SN melanoma cells exhibit delayed activation of MAPK in response to EGF, we have also characterized further the primary tumors originated in nude mice from V3-transduced melanoma cells to determine if other events affect the V3 tumor phenotype. For example, hyaluronan content of LV3SN tumors was higher than in LXSN tumors, whereas other related matrix components and vascularization were unaffected.

Consistently, Brca1-deficient mouse mammary tumors exhibit accelerated growth, pronounced vascularization, and overexpressed ANG1.

{"title": "Hypoxia: targeting the tumour.", "abstract": "Solid tumours contain regions of very low oxygen concentrations that are said to be hypoxic. Hypoxia is a natural phenotype of solid tumours resulting from an imperfect vascular network. There are a number of consequences associated with tumour hypoxia including: resistance to ionising radiation, resistance to chemotherapy and the magnification of mutated p53. In addition tissue hypoxia has been regarded as a key factor for tumour aggressiveness and metastasis by activation of signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory mechanisms. It is clear that hypoxia in solid tumours promotes a strong oncogenic phenotype and is a phenomenon that occurs in all solid tumours. As such this provides a significant target for drug discovery particularly for tumour-targeting agents. A range of chemical classes (N-oxides, quinones, nitro-aromatics) have been explored as bioreductive agents that target tumour hypoxia. The most advanced agent, tirapazamine, is in phase III clinical trials in combination with cis-platin.

Doxorubicin, a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, induces disruption of the hair cycle and subsequent alopecia. We show in this report that doxorubicin causes disruption of the hair-follicle-associated blood vessel network resulting in a greatly reduced density of these blood vessels. Dystrophic hair follicles were also observed with abnormal melanogenesis in the mice treated with doxorubicin. Visualization of the effect of doxorubicin on hair-follicle angiogenesis was made possible by the use of transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein was driven by regulatory elements of the nestin gene (ND-GFP). In these transgenic mice, the hair-follicle stem cells and the follicle structure as well as the blood vessels associated with the hair follicles express ND-GFP. The hair-follicle stem cells did not appear to be affected by doxorubicin, which may explain why hair regrows after chemotherapy. These results suggest that inhibition of hair-follicle-associated angiogenesis by doxorubicin may be an important factor in hair-follicle dystrophy associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia.

This morphological relationship is reflected by a multitude of functional interactions between neurons and M\u00fcller cells, including a 'metabolic symbiosis' and the processing of visual information. M\u00fcller cells are also responsible for the maintenance of the homeostasis of the retinal extracellular milieu (ions, water, neurotransmitter molecules, and pH). In vascularized retinae, M\u00fcller cells may also be involved in the control of angiogenesis, and the regulation of retinal blood flow. Virtually every disease of the retina is associated with a reactive M\u00fcller cell gliosis which, on the one hand, supports the survival of retinal neurons but, on the other hand, may accelerate the progress of neuronal degeneration: M\u00fcller cells protect neurons via a release of neurotrophic factors, the uptake and degradation of the excitotoxin, glutamate, and the secretion of the antioxidant, glutathione. However, gliotic M\u00fcller cells display a dysregulation of various neuron-supportive functions. This contributes to a disturbance of retinal glutamate metabolism and ion homeostasis, and causes the development of retinal edema and neuronal cell death. Moreover, there are diseases evoking a primary M\u00fcller cell insufficiency, such as hepatic retinopathy and certain forms of glaucoma. Any impairment of supportive functions of M\u00fcller cells, primary or secondary, must cause and/or aggravate a dysfunction and loss of neurons, by increasing the susceptibility of neurons to stressful stimuli in the diseased retina. On the contrary, M\u00fcller cells may be used in the future for novel therapeutic strategies to protect neurons against apoptosis (somatic gene therapy), or to differentiate retinal neurons from M\u00fcller/stem cells. Meanwhile, a proper understanding of the gliotic responses of M\u00fcller cells in the diseased retina, and of their protective vs. detrimental effects, is essential for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies that use and stimulate the neuron-supportive/protective-and prevent the destructive-mechanisms of gliosis.", "journal": "Progress in retinal and eye research", "date": "2006-07-15", "authors": ["AndreasBringmann", "ThomasPannicke", "JensGrosche", "MikeFrancke", "PeterWiedemann", "Serguei NSkatchkov", "Neville NOsborne", "AndreasReichenbach"], "doi": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2006.05.003"}

Mast cells were demonstrated by histochemical staining with toluidine blue, alcian blue and safranin O. Microvessel counts were demonstrated by immunohistochemical labelling with an antibody against the endothelial cell marker factor VIII. Mitotic cells, apoptotic cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were counted from haematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Tumour fibrosis was evaluated on Masson's trichome-stained sections. The results showed that progressing tumours had significantly higher mast cell counts and microvessel counts at the invasive edges of the tumours than did regressing tumours. In both the progressing and regressing tumours, microvessel counts were significantly positively correlated with mast cell counts. Regressing tumours had significantly higher mast cell counts of the whole tumour than progressing tumours. The results also showed that progressing tumours had significantly higher mitotic rate than regressing tumours, and fibrosis and apoptosis were significantly higher in regressing tumours than progressing tumours. There were no significant differences between the biochemical and haematological values of dogs with progressing and regressing tumours.

The exact topography of the nutrient foramina of the humerus, radius, and ulna has been specified on 102 dry bones. The osseous resection at the recipient will have to be carried out on these aspects: nutrient foramina of the three bones of the elbow (at 9 cm from medial epicondyle for the humerus; at 8 cm for the two bones of forearm) in order to preserve diaphysary vascularization of the recipient. A study of arterial and venous vascularization carried out on 18 anatomic specimens showed that the osseous ends were irrigated by a periosteal arterial network and were drained in the centromedullary cavities. Systematization of the arteriovenous blood supply of the distal end of the humerus and proximal ends of the two forearm bones is proposed after dissection of 18 anatomic specimens. Arterial periosteal territories are defined. The importance of each peri articular arteriole is estimated according to the surface of its respective section. A radial, constant, and musculoperiosteal collateral artery from the brachial artery is described. It accounts for 12% (+/- 3%) of the total contribution.

OEC reveal a highly differentiated endothelial phenotype as well as a high phenotypic stability during their expansion. Furthermore, OEC showed very promising results in the endothelialization of fibroin silk fiber meshes, maintaining their endothelial characteristics and functions. On the fibroin fiber meshes OECs formed differentiated endothelial cell layers covering the single fibers as shown by data from scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and gene expression analysis. After embedding in a wound-healing matrix, mimicked by fibrin gels, OEC migrated from the fibroin scaffolds into the fibrin and formed a microvessel-like network.

The OFT of modern teleosts is considered to be formed by a single component, the bulbus, the conus having been lost through evolution. This article challenges the concept of the disappearance of the conus arteriosus in the teleost heart. A total of 28 teleost species belonging to 19 families and 10 orders were analyzed. The hearts were divided into two large groups: those having entirely trabeculated ventricles, and those possessing a compacta. In the hearts having entirely trabeculated ventricles, the conus arteriosus appears as a distinct segment interposed between the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus, being formed by compact vascularized myocardium. However, the conus of several species lacks vessels. In these cases, the conus presents large intercellular spaces bounded by collagen. In the hearts possessing a ventricular compacta, the conus either appears as a muscular ring of variable length connecting the ventricle and the bulbus or forms a crown or ring of myocardium apposed to the ventricular base. In all the teleosts studied, the conus can be recognized as an anatomic entity different from the ventricle. Furthermore, the conus appears as a distinct heart segment in the developing fish. Therefore, the conus arteriosus has not been lost in evolution and constitutes a fundamental part of the teleost OFT.

Ultimately, mutant embryos die during mid-gestation. In the 60 years since this discovery, the role of T in allantoic development has remained obscure. T protein was recently identified in several new sites during mouse gastrulation, including the core of the allantois, where its function is not known. Here, using molecular, genetic and classical techniques of embryology, we have investigated the role of T in allantoic development. Conceptuses homozygous for the T(Curtailed) (T(C)) mutation (T(C)/T(C)) exhibited allantoic dysmorphogenesis shortly after the allantoic bud formed. Diminution in allantoic cell number and proliferation was followed by cell death within the core. Fetal liver kinase (Flk1)-positive angioblasts were significantly decreased in T(C)/T(C) allantoises and did not coalesce into endothelial tubules, possibly as a result of the absence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1), whose spatiotemporal relationship to Flk1 suggested a role in patterning the umbilical vasculature. Remarkably, microsurgical perturbation of the wild-type allantoic core phenocopied the T(C)/T(C) vascularization defect, providing further support that an intact core is essential for vascularization. Last, abnormalities were observed in the T(C)/T(C) heart and yolk sac, recently reported sites of T localization. Our findings reveal that T is required to maintain the allantoic core, which is essential for allantoic elongation and vascular patterning.

The A12 was also evaluated in a disseminated xenograft MM.1S NOD/SCID model as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs (bortezomib, melphalan) currently in clinical use. The tumor burden, as determined by luciferase bioimaging, was sharply decreased, and overall survival significantly prolonged when the therapies were combined.

However, the main impediment for the oral delivery of these drugs as potential therapeutic agents is their extensive presystemic metabolism, instability in acidic environment resulting into inadequate and erratic oral absorption. Parenteral route of administration is the only established route that overcomes all these drawbacks associated with these orally less/inefficient drugs. But, these formulations are costly, have least patient compliance, require repeated administration, in addition to the other hazardous effects associated with this route. Over the last few decades' pharmaceutical scientists throughout the world are trying to explore transdermal and transmucosal routes as an alternative to injections. Among the various transmucosal sites available, mucosa of the buccal cavity was found to be the most convenient and easily accessible site for the delivery of therapeutic agents for both local and systemic delivery as retentive dosage forms, because it has expanse of smooth muscle which is relatively immobile, abundant vascularization, rapid recovery time after exposure to stress and the near absence of langerhans cells. Direct access to the systemic circulation through the internal jugular vein bypasses drugs from the hepatic first pass metabolism leading to high bioavailability. Further, these dosage forms are self-administrable, cheap and have superior patient compliance. Developing a dosage form with the optimum pharmacokinetics is a promising area for continued research as it is enormously important and intellectually challenging. With the right dosage form design, local environment of the mucosa can be controlled and manipulated in order to optimize the rate of drug dissolution and permeation. A rational approach to dosage form design requires a complete understanding of the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of the drug and excipients.

We investigated the impact of ET-1 on the development of bone metastases in an immunocompetent murine skin-fold chamber model. Murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 was injected in a skin-fold chamber implanted on CB6 mice along with bone explants. Furthermore, mice were treated with or without a dual selective antagonist of both ET-1 receptors. The progression of the vascularization within the chamber was monitored over time by intravital microscopy (IVM). The tumor growth and the development of bone metastases were assessed by cytokeratin-19 gene expression and histological studies. Results indicate that this new model associated with IVM allows for the continuous monitoring of the change in vascularization associated with the development of bone metastases. Additionally, treatment with an antagonist of both ET-1 receptors was associated with the presence of significantly less vessels near the tumor mass compared to control mice. These changes were correlated with smaller tumor masses and reduced bone invasion (P < 0.05). Thus, in an immunocompetent murine model of breast carcinoma metastases to bone, our data support the hypothesis that vascularization plays a role in tumor development and progression and that ET-1 specifically modulates the angiogenesis associated with breast metastases to the bone.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2006-07-11", "authors": ["DidierDr\u00e9au", "AmelKaraa", "CathyCulberson", "HeatherWyan", "Iain HMcKillop", "Mark GClemens"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-006-9016-z"}

Acute shortening with an Ilizarov frame has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of open tibia fractures with simultaneous bone and soft-tissue loss. Cases in which the soft-tissue defect considerably exceeds bone loss may require an Ilizarov frame along with a concomitant soft-tissue procedure; however, there are a number of potential difficulties with vascularized pedicle flaps and free tissue flaps, including anastomotic complications, partial flap necrosis, and flap failure. The technique described in this report involves acute shortening and temporary bony deformation with the Ilizarov apparatus to facilitate wound closure and does not require a concomitant soft-tissue reconstructive procedure.

{"title": "Sequential changes in vessel formation and micro-vascular function during bone repair.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the process of new vessel formation from a pre-existing vascular network, is essential for bone development and repair. New vessel formation and microvascular functions are crucial during bone repair, not only for sufficient nutrient supply, transport of macromolecules and invading cells, but also because they govern the metabolic microenvironment. Despite its central role, very little is known about the initial processes of vessel formation and microvascular function during bone repair.\nTo visualize and quantify the process of vessel formation and microvascular function during bone repair, we transplanted neonatal femora with a substantial defect into dorsal skin-fold chambers in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice for continuous noninvasive in-vivo evaluation. We employed intravital microscopic techniques to monitor effective microvascular permeability, functional vascular density, blood flow rate and leukocyte flux repeatedly over 16 days. Oxytetracyclin and v. Kossa/v. Giesson staining was performed to quantify the calcification process in vivo and in vitro.\nDevelopment of a hematoma surrounding the defect area was the initial event, which was accompanied by a significant increase in microvascular permeability and blood flow rate. With absorption of the hematoma and vessel maturation, permeability decreased continuously, while vascular density and tissue perfusion increased. Histological evaluation revealed that the remodeling of the substantial defect prolonged the in-vivo monitored calcification process.\nThe size of the initial substantial defect correlated positively with increased permeability, suggesting improved release of permeability-inducing cytokines. The unchanged permeability in the control group with boiled bones and a substantial defect corroborated these findings. The adaptation to increasing metabolic demands was initially mediated by increased blood flow rate, later with increasing vascular density through increased tissue perfusion rate.

Cells expressing myeloid markers are present within the choroidal stroma. However, the exact identity, maturation state, and functions of these CP-associated myeloid cells are not fully clarified. We show here that this cell population contains immature myeloid progenitors displaying a high proliferative potential. Thus, in neonate rats and, to a lesser extent, in adult rats, cultured CP stroma cells form large colonies of macrophages, in response to M-CSF or GM-CSF, while, under the same conditions, peripheral blood monocytes do not. In addition, under GM-CSF treatment, free-floating colonies of CD11c(+) monocytic cells are generated which, when restimulated with GM-CSF and IL-4, differentiate into OX62(+)/MHC class II(+) dendritic cells. Interestingly, in CP stroma cultures, myeloid cells are found in close association with fibroblastic-like cells expressing the neural stem-cell marker nestin. Similarly, in the developing brain, macrophages and nestin(+) fibroblastic cells accumulate in vivo within the choroidal stroma. Taken together, these results suggest that the CP stroma represents a niche for myeloid progenitors and may serve as a reservoir for brain macrophages.", "journal": "Glia", "date": "2006-07-04", "authors": ["SergeNataf", "NathalieStrazielle", "EricHatterer", "GuyMouchiroud", "Marie-Fran\u00e7oiseBelin", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisGhersi-Egea"], "doi": "10.1002/glia.20373"}

Leukocyte accumulation during tumor growth and wound healing in wild-type and CD44-null mice were comparable, and reconstitution of CD44-null mice with wild-type bone marrow did not restore the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that impairments in angiogenesis in CD44-deficient mice are due to the loss of endothelial CD44.

Nascent vessels in Matrigel implants from CD44-null mice demonstrated irregular luminal surfaces characterized by retracted cells and thinned endothelia. Further, an anti-CD44 antibody that disrupted in vitro tube formation induced hemorrhage around Matrigel implants, suggesting that antagonism of endothelial CD44 undermined the integrity of the endothelium of nascent vessels.

We investigated the respective roles of HAS2 and Hyal1 using 22Rv1 human prostate tumor cells that lack both enzyme activities. Stable transfectants were selected for overexpression of Hyal1 or HAS2 and for coexpression of Hyal1 and HAS2. HAS2 overexpression elevated HA production and excess pericellular HA retention. However, HAS2-transfected tumor cell growth in culture was dramatically slowed. Coexpression of Hyal1 with HAS2 diminished HA retention but restored growth kinetics, supporting a possible combined role for excess HA synthesis and processing in maximizing unrestricted growth of prostate cancer cells. In mice, overexpression of HAS2 increased subcutaneous tumor size. Excess activity of either Hyal1 or HAS2 enhanced angiogenesis, but the most significant tumorigenic potential was realized by coexpression of both Hyal1 and HAS2 enzymes.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particle-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and expression of RANK/RANKL and VEGF/VEGF receptors (Flt-1 and Flk-1) using a mouse osteolysis model. UHMWPE particles were introduced into established air pouches on BALB/c mice, followed by implantation of calvaria bone from syngeneic littermates. Mice were injected with either recombinant VEGF or VEGF inhibitor (VEGF R2/F(c) Chimera). Mice without drug treatment, as well as mice injected with saline alone were included. Each group contains 10 mice. Pouch tissues were harvested 2 weeks after bone implantation for histological and molecular analysis. UHMWPE stimulation significantly increased VEGF gene expression, and exerted a lower enhancement effect on the gene expression of Flt-1 and Flk-1. UHMWPE-stimulated VEGF production was markedly reduced by VEGF inhibitor treatment. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that pouch tissue macrophages were the main source of both VEGF and Flt-1 production. A positive association was observed between tissue inflammation and the levels of VEGF and Flt-1 gene transcripts. Both RANK and RANKL gene transcripts were significantly increased by UHMWPE stimulation, which was subsequently reduced by VEGF inhibitor treatment (p<0.05). VEGF treatment increased TRAP(+) cells in pouches either with or without UHMWPE particle stimulation, and VEGF inhibitor treatment caused a significant reduction in the number of TRAP(+) cells in UHMWPE-containing pouches. This study suggests that VEGF has a role in the regulation of RANK/RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, and warrant future investigations to elucidate the role of VEGF signaling in the pathogenesis of prosthetic loosening.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2006-07-04", "authors": ["Wei PingRen", "David CMarkel", "RenwenZhang", "XinPeng", "BinWu", "HawkinsMonica", "Paul HWooley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.004"}

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells: from bench to bedside.", "abstract": "Strong evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived cells play a role in physiological and pathological blood vessel growth in the adult, both by augmenting angiogenesis through the secretion of angiogenic growth factors and by providing a rich source of progenitor cells that can differentiate into mature vascular endothelial cells. This is a true paradigm shift, since adult neovascularization processes were thought to be limited to angiogenesis. The cells that are critical to postnatal blood vessel growth - endothelial progenitor cells - may be analogous to the embryonic angioblast, in that they can circulate, proliferate and participate in the development of vascular networks by differentiating in situ, probably via the formation of cell clusters into mature endothelial cells. Therefore, initial reports have seen analogs to the process of vasculogenesis in the embryo, where the de novo synthesis of vessels occurs through the formation of blood island-like clusters, which subsequently connect and eventually form systemic vasculature. Recent work implicates precursors of endothelial cells in such processes as myocardial ischemia and infarction, limb ischemia, wound healing, atherosclerosis, endogenous endothelial repair and tumor vascularization.

However, the molecular basis of UV-induced angiogenesis in skin remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the roles of UV exposure on cutaneous angiogenesis, its associated signaling mechanisms, and the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) on UV-induced vascularization, and VEGF expression. Using a human epidermal cell line, HaCaT, we found that UV induces VEGF mRNA and protein expression via the MAPK/ERK kinase-ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathway but not via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and that tRA pretreatment significantly inhibits UV-induced VEGF overexpression and ERK1/2 activation. In human skin in vivo, we confirmed that skin vascularization significantly increased after a single exposure to UV, as was evidenced by a prominent increase in vessel size, vascular density, and in the cutaneous area occupied by vessels, and we found that these events are associated with VEGF upregulation. Topical pretreatment with tRA under occlusion inhibited not only UV-induced VEGF upregulation and angiogenesis with a significant reduction of vessel density but also UV-induced ERK1/2 activation in human skin. Collectively, our data demonstrate that tRA inhibits the UV-induced angiogenic switch via downmodulation of ERK1/2 activation and consecutive VEGF overexpression. These findings may help us understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate skin angiogenesis due to UV exposure, and provide evidence of the potential of tRA in terms of preventing angiogenesis-associated skin damage following exposure to UV irradiation.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2006-07-01", "authors": ["Mi-SunKim", "Yeon KKim", "Hee CEun", "Kwang HCho", "Jin HChung"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.jid.5700463"}

They are also growth retarded evidencing an alteration in the GH-IGF-I axis. In D2R KO, lactotropes do not show dense secretory granules but degranulated cells and fewer somatotropes, gonadotropes and thyrotropes. Prolactin levels are always higher in female than in male knockouts, and in accordance, pituitary hyperplasia is observed at 8 months only in females. After 16 months of age, highly vascularized adenomas develop, especially in females. Prominent vascular channels in the hyperplastic and adenomatous pituitaries, as well as extravasated red blood cells not contained in capillaries is also a common finding. Prolactin is not the factor that enhances the hyperplastic phenotype in females while estrogen is a permissive factor. VEGF-A expression is increased in pituitaries from D2R KO. VEGF-A is expressed in follicle stellate cells. Because D2R receptors are found in lactotropes and not in follicle stellate cells, it may be inferred that a paracrine-derived factor from lactotropes is acting on follicle stellate cells to increase VEGF-A expression. VEGF-A does not induce pituitary cell proliferation, even though it enhances prolactin secretion. But it may act on adjacent endothelial cells and participate in the angiogenic process that increases the availability of different growth factors and mitogens.

CB-EC and Bcl-2-HUVEC formed more human EC-lined vessels than AB-EC or control HUVEC; CB-EC, Bcl-2-HUVEC, and AB-EC but not control HUVEC promoted ingrowth of mouse EC-lined vessels. Bcl-2 transduction increased the number of human and mouse EC-lined vessels in grafts seeded with HUVEC but not with CB-EC or AB-EC. Both CB-EC and AB-EC-induced microvessels became invested by smooth muscle cell-specific alpha-actin-positive mural cells, indicative of maturation.

We hypothesized that inclusion of small quantities of heparin (Hp) in these gels would regulate growth factor (GF) release over an extended period, while still maintaining the in vivo bioactivity of released GFs. To test this hypothesis, HA, Gtn, and Hp (15 kDa) were modified with thiol groups, then co-crosslinked with poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). Either VEGF or bFGF was incorporated into the gels before crosslinking with PEGDA. Release of these GFs in vitro could be sustained over 42 days by less than 1% Hp content, and was found to decrease monotonically with increasing Hp concentration. As little as 0.03% Hp in the gels reduced the released VEGF fraction from 30% to 21%, while 3% Hp reduced it to 19%. Since the minimum Hp concentration capable of effective controlled GF release in vitro was found to be 0.3% (w/w), this concentration was selected for subsequent in vivo experiments. To evaluate the bioactivity of released GFs in vivo, gel samples were implanted into the ear pinnas of Balb/c mice and the resulting neovascularization response measured. In the presence of Hp, vascularization was sustained over 28 days. GF release was more rapid in vitro from gels containing Gtn than from gels lacking Gtn, though unexpectedly, the in vivo neovascularization response to Gtn-containing gels was decreased.

{"title": "Lymphangiogenesis in the developing lung promoted by VEGF-A.", "abstract": "Understanding the basic processes of late-stage pulmonary vascular development is essential as this period corresponds to the stage when preterm infants have increased chance of survival. During this period, refinement of the gas exchange unit leads to close apposition of the capillary vasculature and airway epithelium through thinning of the mesenchyme, formation of alveolar septae and functional adaptation of endothelial cells into vessels including pulmonary lymphatics. The pulmonary lymphatic network promotes efficient gas exchange through maintaining interstitial fluid balance. Through conditional transgene regulation, we found that a modest, pathologically relevant increase in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in distal lung during only the perinatal period adversely affected final refinement of the gas exchange unit. VEGF-A induction disrupted the established vascular network, increased endothelial cell number, altered endothelial ultrastructure and reduced mesenchymal thinning. In addition, VEGF-A induction caused a 3-fold increase in small vessels identified as lymphatics in distal lung. mRNA levels of lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-D/-C were unchanged, while levels of the cognate receptor VEGFR-3 increased. The responses to VEGF-A induction in the perinatal period differ from those during early lung development when endothelial migration, but not proliferation altered initial vascular patterning (Akeson, A.L., Greenberg, J.M., Cameron, J.E., Thompson, F.Y., Brooks, S.K., Wiginton, D., Whitsett, J.A., 2003.

Comparative quantitative microscopy showed that both VD and CD do not exhibit significant interareal differences in the adult rat brain.

However, VEGF-A can also be constitutively expressed as a result of genetic events. VEGF-A is alternatively spliced to yield at least 6 different isoforms. Of these, VEGF-A(121) is freely diffusible whereas basically charged domains in the larger isoforms confer affinity for cell surface or extracellular matrix components. We previously reported that in a mouse brain metastasis model of human melanoma, VEGF-A(121) induced a qualitatively different tumor vascular phenotype than VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(189): in contrast to the latter ones, and VEGF-A(121) did not induce a neovascular bed but rather led to leakage and dilatation of preexistent brain vessels. Here, we correlate vascular phenotypes with spatial VEGF-A expression profiles in clinical brain tumors (low grade gliomas; n = 6, melanoma metastases; n = 4, adenocarcinoma metastases; n = 4, glioblastoma multiforme; n = 3, sarcoma metastasis; n = 1, renal cell carcinoma metastasis; n = 1). We show that tumors that constitutively express VEGF-A present with different vascular beds than tumors in which VEGF-A is expressed as a response to central hypoxia. This phenotypic difference is consistent with a model where in tumors with constitutive VEGF-A expression, all isoforms exert their effects on vasculature, resulting in a classical angiogenic phenotype.

{"title": "A molecular dynamics study of human endostatin and its synthetic fragments with antiangiogenic properties.", "abstract": "Human endostatin is one of the better characterized endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, and its ability to modulate vascularization of tumours could be of great therapeutic interest. These properties are not exclusive to the full-length protein, but are shared by some of its synthetic fragments. A number of research groups have partitioned human endostatin in different peptides and have investigated their activity, in order to collect a body of experimental data which could be important in shedding new light on their structure-activity relationships. It was also reported that a small active fragment can become inactive when contained in a larger fragment, revealing an apparent discrepancy in the experimental results. Very few studies have been devoted to the computational analysis of these systems and to the rationalization of their properties using molecular modelling. Through molecular dynamics simulations of human endostatin and of four synthetic fragments, we have been able to rationalize the experimental findings. In particular, we have identified a pattern consisting of six amino acids, namely R-R(G)-A-D-R-A, which appears to be an active epitope if it is properly exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, this pattern can be already present in sequential order in the primary structure, or it can be generated by the spatial approach of two groups of residues, far apart in the primary structure, as an effect of the peptide folding.

In 2 female patients, ages 35 and 44, with symptomatic tumors of that entity (10 and 14 cm, respectively, in size) we performed a laparoscopic liver resection. Directly before undergoing this operation they underwent a selective angiographic embolization of the arterial inflow for control of hemorrhage by application of polyvinyl alcohol particles to the afferent arteries. This procedure led to a complete interruption in arterial inflow and the subsequent laparoscopic resection itself could be carried out as planned with minimal blood loss as well an uncomplicated postoperative course. The patients demonstrated a high degree of subjective satisfaction with the procedure. A reduction in arterial inflow through selective embolization is a useful tool in the preparation for laparoscopic resection of large, well-vascularized liver tumors.", "journal": "Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques", "date": "2006-06-29", "authors": ["LutzWilhelm", "LotharAlbrecht", "MichaelKirsch", "Claus DieterHeidecke"], "doi": "10.1097/00129689-200606000-00014"}
{"title": "[Mobilization of stem cells in cardiovascular disease. Improvement of vascularization, cardiac function and arrhythmias].", "abstract": "Besides re-injecting mostly autologous stem cells also the mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow is increasingly evaluated. Mobilization of bone marrow cells can be induced by drugs, e.g., growth factors, or by physical exercise. Exercise leads to a number of physiological cardiopulmonary changes, and an improved vascularization of the heart and skeletal muscle, initiated by endothelial progenitor cells derived from the bone marrow. Particularly, duration exercise activates not only the release of CD34-positive cells, it also leads to increased pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) being one of them. Originally, it was believed that therapeutic effects following bone marrow mobilization were based on the homing and transdifferentiation of bone marrow cells into cardiomyocytes, new data support the notion that the most important mechanism might be via paracrine and/or direct effects of G-CSF.", "journal": "Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)", "date": "2006-06-29", "authors": ["SigridNikol", "MichaelKuhlmann"], "doi": null}

Sonographic examination revealed an intrauterine gestational sac and ovarian endometrial cyst. At 21 weeks of gestation, characteristic findings associated with malignant transformation of ovarian endometriosis were seen on color-flow Doppler sonography and contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Under the diagnosis of malignant transformation of ovarian endometriosis, right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed at 22 weeks' gestation. However, histopathologic examination revealed ovarian endometriosis with marked decidual changes but no evidence of malignancy.\nDuring pregnancy, intracystic vascularized excrescences of an endometrial cyst indicate not only malignant transformation but also decidualization. Thus, the preoperative differential diagnosis is reportedly difficult. However, the present findings of decidualization on magnetic resonance imaging seemed to be slightly different from those of malignant transformation, and therefore, might help distinguish decidualized endometriosis from malignant transformation preoperatively.", "journal": "European journal of gynaecological oncology", "date": "2006-06-28", "authors": ["HIwamoto", "MSuzuki", "NWatanabe", "MMinai", "SHirata", "KHoshi"], "doi": null}

Since 1988, Wiltse recommends to practice a single median incision because of aesthetic arguments and because it avoids potential difficulties in case of iterative surgery. In this paper, the goal of authors was to determine the advantages of two lateral incisions, particularly in term of cutaneous vascularization. This cadaveric study concerned ten specimens. Colored latex was injected into the lumbar segmentary arteries before taking a cutaneous flap. We calculated the mean of the number of vessels injected and cut on the midline, then all the 10 mm on both sides. The goal was to establish a cutaneous cartography, and to determine a zone of less vascular sacrifice. The lumbar skin was vascularized by an arteriolar network which spreads out from the midline. At 30 mm from the midline, the number of cut vessels is statistically less than in the others areas (P < 0.05). At this distance, the small arteries are superficial, fine, and the subcutaneous tissue appears poorly vascularized. The two lateral incisions have the advantage compared to a single median incision of being short, and of allowing a direct access to the muscular plan of cleavage without subcutaneous detachment, with a less pressure retraction. We think that an incision at 30 mm from spinous processes is less noxious for the skin because it is located at the border of two vascular territories, which depend of a median network for one, and a lateral network for the other. These incisions generate technical difficulties, however, when the approach is prolonged with the top of L2/L3, when a lateral and/or central canalar decompression is considered, and finally, in the event of iterative surgery.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2006-06-27", "authors": ["EricOlivier", "JulienBeldame", "MouradOuld Slimane", "ThomasDefives", "FabriceDuparc"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-006-0123-y"}

Wound healing comprises cleansing, granulation/vascularization, and epithelialization phases. An optimum microenvironment and the absence of cytotoxic factors are essential for epithelialization. This study examines the effect of extracts of different wound dressings on keratinocyte survival and proliferation.\nKeratinocyte cultures were exposed for 40 hours to at least three extracts of each of the following wound dressings, which were tested in octuplicate: Acticoat, Aquacel-Ag, Aquacel, Algisite M, Avance, Comfeel Plus transparent, Contreet-H, Hydrasorb, and SeaSorb. Silicone extract provided the reference material. Controls were included of cells cultured in medium that had been incubated under conditions identical to those used with the extracts. Cell survival (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction) and proliferation (5-bromo-2':-deoxyuridine incorporation) were measured.\nExtracts of silver-containing dressings (Acticoat, Aquacel-Ag, Contreet-H, and Avance) were most cytotoxic. Extracts of Hydrasorb were less cytotoxic but markedly affected keratinocyte proliferation and morphology. Extracts of alginate-containing dressings (Algisite M, SeaSorb, and Contreet-H) demonstrated high calcium concentrations, markedly reduced keratinocyte proliferation, and affected keratinocyte morphology. Extracts of Aquacel and Comfeel Plus transparent induced small but significant inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation.\nThe principle of minimizing harm should be applied to the choice of wound dressing. Silver-based dressings are cytotoxic and should not be used in the absence of infection. Alginate dressings with high calcium content affect keratinocyte proliferation probably by triggering terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Such dressings should be used with caution in cases in which keratinocyte proliferation is essential.

{"title": "A true one-stage nonmicrosurgical technique for total phallic reconstruction.", "abstract": "A new nonmicrosurgical technique for one-stage total phallic reconstruction is presented. In this procedure, an innervated anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap including the medial half of the fascia latae is combined with a sartorius perforator flap. Both flaps are elevated together as an island chimeric flap based on the lateral circumflex femoral vessels and tunneled to the recipient area. The neourethra is created with thin and hairless skin of the sartorius perforator flap, while the ALT flap is used to construct the shaft and glans of the neophallus. The rigidity was provided with a penile prosthesis covered with a neotunica albuginea created with vascularized fascia latae for the first time in the literature. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the ALT flap is coapted to the pudendal nerve to provide erogenous sensibility. Here, a 15-year-old male in whom this new procedure was used for one-stage total phallic reconstruction is presented. Two years of follow-up revealed that an esthetically acceptable and functional neopenis with a nonhairy competent urethra, erogenous sensitivity, and a proper rigidity was achieved with no complication. This new technique, namely, the \"Istanbul on the thigh\" flap, is a one-stage, safe, and timesaving technique which fulfills all essential goals of phallic reconstruction but does not require microsurgical equipment and expertise.

A staged approach to ridge splitting in the mandible to decrease the risk of malfracture during osteotomy is presented.\nFive consecutive patients with 6 long-span edentulous areas of the mandibular ridge were included in this study. After corticotomy of a rectangular buccal segment and a 40-day healing period, the mandibular ridge was split, leaving the buccal periosteum attached to the lateralized segment. Seventeen dental implants were placed, and the gap between the implants and the bone filled with a mixture of venous blood and a porous algae-derived hydroxyapatite.\nAll buccal segments fractured as planned at the basal corticotomy during ridge splitting. After 6 months, all implants were stable and surrounded by bone; prosthetic loading with fixed partial dentures was successful in all cases.\nIn the mandible, greenstick fracture during widening with osteotomes has not been controllable to date because of cortical thickness of the bone; the risk of malfracture during single-stage ridge splitting was high. With this approach, the location of the greenstick fracture is predetermined, and the perfusion for the buccal segment remains intact, although vascularization shifts from internal perfusion from spongy bone after the first intervention to external perfusion from the periosteum after the second intervention. The buccal cortical segment remains a pedicled graft after ridge splitting.\nThe preliminary results of this report indicate that staged ridge splitting can be a safe technique which overcomes the problems associated with single-stage ridge expansion/ridge splitting procedures without causing significant delay in treatment.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2006-06-27", "authors": ["GeorgEnislidis", "GerdWittwer", "RolfEwers"], "doi": null}

In organotypic cultured mouse embryonic metatarsals isolated before vascularization, the chondral mineralization was significantly decreased in the presence of Glu at a high concentration. Apoptotic cells were detected within the late proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytic layers in metatarsals cultured in the presence of Glu. A group III metabotropic GluR (mGluR) antagonist partially, but significantly, prevented the inhibition of mineralization by Glu in metatarsals without affecting the number of apoptotic cells. Both decreased mineralization and apoptosis by Glu were significantly prevented by the addition of the cystine/Glu antiporter inhibitor homocysteic acid, as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) and cystine. Expression of mRNA for xCT and 4F2hc subunits, which are components of the cystine/Glu antiporter, was seen in both cultured mouse metatarsals and rat costal chondrocytes. In chondrocytes cultured with Glu, a significant decrease was seen in intracellular GSH levels, together with increases in the number of apoptotic cells and the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that Glu could regulate chondrogenic differentiation toward mineralization through a mechanism associated with apoptosis mediated by the depletion of intracellular GSH after the retrograde operation of the cystine/Glu antiporter, in addition to the activation of group III mGluR, in chondrocytes.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2006-06-23", "authors": ["LiyangWang", "EiichiHinoi", "AkihiroTakemori", "NoritakaNakamichi", "YukioYoneda"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M600939200"}

In this study, we analyzed tumor growth, vascularization, and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) expression during the development of U-87 MG xenografts. We found that tumoral angiogenesis in this model follows a multistage process characterized by avascular, prolific peripheral angiogenesis, and late vascular phases. On day 4, we observed an area of central necrosis, a peripheral ring of Ang2-positive glioma cells, and reactive Ang2-positive vascular structures in the tumor/brain interface. When the tumor had developed a vascular network, Ang2 was expressed only in peripheral vascular structures. Because Ang2 expression was downmodulated in the late stages of development, probably to maintain a stable tumoral vasculature, we next studied whether sustained Ang2 expression might impair vascular development and, ultimately, tumor growth. Ang2 prevented the formation of capillary-like structures by and impaired angiogenesis in a chorioallantoic membrane chicken model. Finally, we tested the effect of sustained Ang2 expression on U-87 MG xenograft development. Ang2 significantly prolonged the survival of intracranial U-87 MG tumor-bearing animals. Examination of Ang2-treated xenografts revealed areas of tumor necrosis and vascular damage.

Angiogenesis is a complex process involving a variety of growth factors and several cell types. The mechanism regulating angiogenesis during fracture repair is not well understood, and the relationships between angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis are also undefined. In vivo animal models have been useful for determining angiogenic mechanisms. In particular, a murine model has been developed that offers the advantages of easy animal handling, low cost, reliable healing, and the availability of molecular and genetic techniques for research. However, the small size of mice provides challenges, including the inability to assess vascularization using techniques that have been employed in larger animals. Therefore, we developed and optimized techniques specifically for studying angiogenesis during mouse fracture repair. These techniques include blood vessel casting, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and genetic labeling of endothelial cells. Blood vessel casting and micro-CT are useful for visualization of small blood vessels. Immunohistochemistry using anti-PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) or CD34 antibodies and genetic approaches using Tie2-cre transgenic mice can be used to label endothelial cells, visualize blood vessels including capillaries, and provide structural information about the vascularization of the fracture callous.

The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of ZD6474 in the control of established experimental lung metastasis and pleural effusions produced by human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. PC14PE6 (adenocarcinoma) and H226 (squamous cell carcinoma) cells express high levels of EGFR and only PC14PE6 cells overexpress VEGF. Neither ZD6474 nor the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib inhibit proliferation of PC14PE6 or H226 cells in vitro. Both PC14PE6 and H226 cells inoculated intravenously into nude mice induced multiple lung nodules after 5-7 weeks. In addition, PC14PE6 cells produced bloody pleural effusions. Daily oral treatment with ZD6474 did not reduce the number of lung nodules produced by PC14PE6 or H226 cells, but did reduce the lung weight and the size of lung nodules. ZD6474 also inhibited the production of pleural effusions by PC14PE6 cells. Histological analyses of lung lesions revealed that ZD6474 treatment inhibited activation of VEGFR-2 and reduced tumor vascularization and tumor cell proliferation. Therapeutic effects of ZD6474 were considered likely to be due to inhibition of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase because gefitinib was inactive in this model. These results indicate that ZD6474, an inhibitor of VEGFR-2, may be useful in controlling the growth of established lung metastasis and pleural effusions by NSCLC.", "journal": "Oncology research", "date": "2006-06-21", "authors": ["YukaMatsumori", "SeijiYano", "HisatsuguGoto", "EmikoNakataki", "Stephen RWedge", "Anderson JRyan", "SaburoSone"], "doi": "10.3727/000000006783981260"}
{"title": "Impact of radiation therapy on healing and stability of vascularized bone grafts in a dog model.", "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to observe the impact of radiation therapy on healing and biomechanical properties of vascularized bone grafts, and thus to establish an appropriate large animal model. Ten male beagles were divided into two experimental groups: radiation (R) and control (C). The left 5th to 7th ribs of the animals of group R were irradiated 3 and 2 weeks preoperatively, using a dose of 8 Gy each time. Each animal of both groups underwent the following operative procedures. The 5th and 7th ribs were removed, and the 5th rib was replaced by a vascularized pedicle transfer of the 4th rib. The 7th rib was reconstructed using a pedicle transplant of the 8th rib. The 5th and 7th ribs were used as nonvascularized bone grafts to replace the donor sites of the 4th and 8th ribs, respectively. Group R received two further irradiation cycles 2 and 3 weeks postoperatively. The vascularized rib grafts of group R demonstrated a higher number of delayed unions in plain x-rays and avascular bone segments in microangiography than the control group. The presence of vital osteocytes in histology was not significantly different between groups. Biomechanical tests focusing on the durability of vascularized ribs against bending and torsion forces demonstrated a reduction of average maximum bending moments by 56.6% after radiation compared to controls (P < 0.05). Twisting moments were reduced by 47.6% (P < 0.05). The data demonstrate a significant worsening in bone healing and stability after pre- and postoperative radiation therapy to the wound bed and bone grafts.

In mammals, lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells possibly sprouting from embryonic veins, and their development appears to be critically dependent on the function of PROX1 and VEGFC signaling . The existence of a lymphatic system in teleosts has been a matter of debate for decades.

We demonstrate the existence of vessels that are molecularly and functionally distinct from blood vessels and show that the development of these vessels depends on Vegfc and VEGFR-3/Flt4 signaling.

Patient ages ranged from 3 to 19 years (mean: 10.8 years). Four donor sites were used: gracilis muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, iliac crest osteocutaneous, and vascularized fibula. Fourteen patients had tissue defects related to trauma: nine received a gracilis flap; five received a latissimus dorsi flap. Five patients had tissue defects related to malignant tumor resection: three patients with Ewing's sarcoma received free fibulae; one patient with an osteogenic sarcoma received a gracilis flap, and another received an iliac crest osteocutaneous flap. Fifteen patients had congenital anomaly-related tissue defects: five with talipes equinovarus received gracilis flaps; ten with congenital tibial pseudoarthrosis received free fibulae. Vascular outcome was assessed based on the achievement of flap perfusion and post-surgical vascular revisions. Complete flap survival was achieved in 32 cases (85.3 percent); partial flap loss in three cases (8.82 percent); and complete flap loss in two cases (5.9 percent). Early revision surgery for the five partial or failed flaps consisted of debridement and split-thickness skin graft or flap removal. No patients required vascular take-backs or experienced vascular spasm. There were no systemic problems associated with the long and complex surgeries. Functional outcome was assessed based on ambulation, post-surgical complications, and whether the flap served its intended purpose. Ambulation was achieved in all cases. Functional surgical revisions were required in 32.4 percent of cases, and included scar revisions, flap debulking, bone grafts, and pin insertion. The most prevalent morbidity was persistent leg-length discrepancy (35.3 percent of cases). Only one successful flap was unable to meet its intended purpose, as a tibial pseudoarthrosis persisted, despite initial excision and a well-perfused reconstruction. Results show that free tissue transfer is safe and dependable for tissue defects of the lower extremity in children. From the authors' experience, free flaps used for the repair of defects from congenital tibial pseudoarthrosis have a high vascular success, but also require an extensive rehabilitation course, with only moderate functional success. There was no significant difference between flap surgeries performed immediately, intermediately, or late after trauma.

{"title": "Cholangiocytes and blood supply.", "abstract": "The microvascular supply of the biliary tree, the peribiliary plexus (PBP), stems from the hepatic artery branches and flows into the hepatic sinusoids. A detailed three-dimensional study of the PBP has been performed by using the Scanning Electron Microscopy vascular corrosion casts (SEMvcc) technique. Considering that the PBP plays a fundamental role in supporting the secretory and absorptive functions of the biliary epithelium, their organization in either normalcy and pathology is explored. The normal liver shows the PBP arranged around extra- and intrahepatic biliary tree. In the small portal tract PBP was characterized by a single layer of capillaries which progressively continued with the extrahepatic PBP where it showed a more complex vascular network. After common duct ligation (BDL), progressive modifications of bile duct and PBP proliferation are observed. The PBP presents a three-dimensional network arranged around many bile ducts and appears as bundles of vessels, composed by capillaries of homogeneous diameter with a typical round mesh structure. The PBP network is easily distinguishable from the sinusoidal network which appears normal. Considering the enormous extension of the PBP during BDL, the possible role played by the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is evaluated. VEGF-A, VEGF-C and their related receptors appeared highly immunopositive in proliferating cholangiocytes of BDL rats. The administration of anti-VEGF-A or anti-VEGF-C antibodies to BDL rats as well as hepatic artery ligation induced a reduced bile duct mass. The administration of rVEGF-A to BDL hepatic artery ligated rats prevented the decrease of cholangiocyte proliferation and VEGF-A expression as compared to BDL control rats. These data suggest the role of arterial blood supply of the biliary tree in conditions of cholangiocyte proliferation, such as it occurs during chronic cholestasis. On the other hand, the role played by VEGF as a tool of cross-talk between cholangiocytes and PBP endothelial cells suggests that manipulation of VEGF release and function could represent a therapeutic strategy for human pathological conditions characterized by damage of hepatic artery or the biliary tree.", "journal": "World journal of gastroenterology", "date": "2006-06-15", "authors": ["EugenioGaudio", "AntonioFranchitto", "LuigiPannarale", "GuidoCarpino", "GianfrancoAlpini", "HeatherFrancis", "ShannonGlaser", "DomenicoAlvaro", "PaoloOnori"], "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v12.i22.3546"}

The knowledge of biliary function is rapidly increasing because of the recognition that biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) are the targets of human cholangiopathies, which are characterized by proliferation/damage of bile ducts within a small range of sizes. The unique anatomy, morphology, innervation and vascularization of the biliary epithelium are consistent with function of cholangiocytes within different regions of the biliary tree. The in vivo models [e.g., bile duct ligation (BDL), partial hepatectomy, feeding of bile acids, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)] and the in vivo experimental tools [e.g., freshly isolated small and large cholangiocytes or intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDU) and primary cultures of small and large murine cholangiocytes] have allowed us to demonstrate the morphological and functional heterogeneity of the intrahepatic biliary epithelium. These models demonstrated the differential secretory activities and the heterogeneous apoptotic and proliferative responses of different sized ducts. Similar to animal models of cholangiocyte proliferation/injury restricted to specific sized ducts, in human liver diseases bile duct damage predominates specific sized bile ducts.

The aim of the present anatomical work was to study it in a more systematic way and find clinical applications.\nThe study was carried on 40 fingers from 10 fresh cadaver hands. Two catheters (16 gauge) were introduced into the radial and ulnar arteries on the volar side of the wrist. Acetone was used for arterial cleaning and color latex for the arterial system coloration. The authors proceeded with the dissections, always in the same manner: they first made the longitudinal dorsal incisions from the metacarpophalangeal to distal interphalangeal joints. Raising the skin, they identified the thin subcutaneous branches into the hypodermal plane; they followed their course until their origin, which allowed identification of the arterial branches of the extensor apparatus. For measurements, they used as a point of reference the emergence distance of those dorsal branches from the metacarpophalangeal and proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.\nThe extensor apparatus vascularization was segmental, realized through the paratenon from the branches of a vascular cutano-tendino-osseous complex through a common trunk, issued from the propria digital artery. This complex nourished not only the extensor apparatus but also the dorsal digital skin and periosteum. Its location was consistent at the level of both proximal and middle phalanges.\nThis consistency explains the anatomical basis for the realization of composite-free tissue transfer in cases of banked fingers.

In this work, the authors demonstrate a method of producing three-dimensional contractile skeletal muscles in vivo by incorporating an axial vascular pedicle.\nPrimary myoblast cultures were generated from adult F344 rat soleus muscle. The cells were suspended in a fibrinogen hydrogel contained within cylindrical silicone chambers, and situated around the femoral vessels in isogeneic adult recipient rats. The constructs were allowed to incubate in vivo for 3 weeks, at which point they were explanted and subjected to isometric force measurements and histologic evaluation.\nThe resulting three-dimensional engineered skeletal muscle constructs produced longitudinal contractile force when electrically stimulated. Length-tension, force-voltage, and force-frequency relationships were similar to those found in developing skeletal muscle. Desmin staining demonstrated that individual myoblasts had undergone fusion to form multinucleated myotubes. Von Willebrand staining showed that the local environment within the chamber was richly angiogenic, and capillaries had grown into and throughout the constructs from the femoral artery and vein.\nThree-dimensional, vascularized skeletal muscle can be engineered in vivo.

{"title": "Further clarification of the nomenclature for compound flaps.", "abstract": "After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the attributes and unique niche for compound flaps and their limitations. 2. Comprehend a proposed schema for further clarifying the classification of all types of compound flaps that is differentiated on the basis of the distinct vascular supply to each flap subtype. 3. Appreciate that minor technical modifications of known flaps of any type in general do not necessarily create a new category of flap.\nA unique niche exists for compound flaps because of their extraordinary capability to allow repair of massive defects where the simultaneous restoration of multiple missing tissue components is demanded. The guidelines from the previous \"simplified\" classification schema need to be updated to allow a more complete clarification and further standardization of this concept.\nCompound flaps can be partitioned into two major classes that in turn are further differentiated into various subtypes according to their inherent pattern of circulation.\nThe subdivisions of compound flaps are those with a solitary source of vascularization and those with combinations of sources of vascularization. Those with a solitary source include composite flaps, defined as multiple tissue components all served by the same single vascular supply, and thereby consisting of dependent parts. Those flaps with combinations of sources of vascularization include (1) conjoined flaps, defined as multiple flap territories, dependent because of some common physical junction, yet each retaining its independent vascular supply; and (2) chimeric flaps, defined as multiple flap territories, each with an independent vascular supply, and independent of any physical interconnection except where linked by a common source vessel.\nAlthough many technical modifications have improved and will improve the reliability and versatility of compound flaps, these maneuvers alone should not be confused with creating distinct flap types but rather acknowledged to be only important variations. With this understanding, this revised nomenclature system for compound flaps is intended to be a means of standardizing communication and to facilitate research agendas on a common ground, fully realizing its primary role still only to serve as a convenient guideline.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2006-06-15", "authors": ["Geoffrey GHallock"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000219178.20541.7f"}

For the prefabricated patch group (PFP; n=10), collagen sponge was inserted into the omentum. After 1 week, the pigs underwent a hemicystectomy and the sponge with an attached omental flap was brought to close the defect. For the non-prefabricated patch group (NPFP; n=6), pigs received hemicystectomy and closure with a collagen sponge without prefabricating in the omentum. Four other pigs received hemicystectomy alone as a control (C; n=4). All animals in the NPFP and C groups, and 7 of 10 in the PFP group were sacrificed at 4 or 8 weeks.

By use of a signal transduction antibody array representing 400 different signal transduction molecules, we now show that HRGP and the synthetic peptide HRGP330 specifically induce tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and its downstream substrate paxillin in endothelial cells. HRGP/HRGP330 treatment of endothelial cells induced disruption of actin stress fibers, a process reversed by treatment of cells with the FAK inhibitor geldanamycin. In addition, VEGF-mediated endothelial cell tubular morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen matrix was inhibited by HRGP and HRGP330. In contrast, VEGF-induced proliferation was not affected by HRGP or HRGP330, demonstrating the central role of cell migration during tube formation.

The most common type is hemiballism, and bilateral ballism is extremely rare. In contrast to hemiballism with preferential involvement of the contralateral subthalamic nucleus, bilateral ballism results from diffuse lesions on both sides of the basal ganglia. Here, we present a patient in whom bilateral ballism occurred as a result of hypoglycemia. A 75-year-old man with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had suffered recurrent episodes of paroxysmal and transient involuntary movements of all 4 limbs over a 6-week period. When he visited our hospital first, he was alert and well-oriented. Neurological examination revealed no deficits except right hemianopsia. Violent involuntary movements suddenly manifested 10 days later during MRI scans. Involuntary movements occurred in all 4 limbs, more prominently on the left side, lasted over 15 min in total, and ceased spontaneously. These movements were considered as bilateral ballism. The patient was awake, but rather confused. Serum glucose level during this attack was 25 mg/dl. Intravenous glucose was administered, and he became aware. Brain CT and MRI showed no evilence of ischemic or other basal ganglia pathology and no significant vascular lesions were detected by MR angiograhy. EEG revealed no epileptic discharges. He was admitted to our hospital and insulin dosage was adjusted. No further episodes occurred during a 6-month follow up. Our patient experienced an episode of bilateral ballism associated with documented hypoglycemia. In addition, good control of serum glucose with an appropriate insulin treatment has abolished the involuntary movement episodes described above. Conversely, the basal ganglia is known to be vulnerable to hypoglycemia, due to large metabolic demand and poor vascularization. Recurrent episodes of bilateral ballism in this case may thus have been caused by transient dysfunction of the basal ganglia due to hypoglycemia.

Solutes permeating this barrier exhibit concentration gradients along the capillary. This paper introduces a generic model, GENTEX, to characterize blood-tissue exchanges. GENTEX is a whole organ model of the vascular network providing intraorgan flow heterogeneity and accounts for substrate transmembrane transport, binding and metabolism in erythrocytes, plasma, endothelial cells, interstitial space and cardiomyocytes. The model is tested here for the analysis of multiple tracer indicator dilution data on purine nucleoside metabolism in the isolated Krebs-Henseleit-perfused non-working hearts. It has been also used for analysing NMR contrast data for regional myocardial flows and for positron emission tomographic studies of cardiac receptor kinetics. The facilitating transporters, binding sites and enzymatic reactions are nonlinear elements and allow competition between substrates and a reaction sequence of up to five substrate-product reactions in a metabolic network. Strategies for application start with experiment designs incorporating inert reference tracers. For the estimation of endothelial and sarcolemmal permeability-surface area products and metabolism of the substrates and products, model solutions were optimized to fit the data from pairs of tracer injections (of either inosine or adenosine, plus the reference tracers) injected under the same circumstances a few minutes later.

{"title": "Cholesteryl oligoarginine delivering vascular endothelial growth factor siRNA effectively inhibits tumor growth in colon adenocarcinoma.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a multifunctional angiogenic growth factor that is a primary stimulant of the development and maintenance of a vascular network in the vascularization of solid tumors. It has been reported that a blockade of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis is a powerful method for tumor regression. RNA interference represents a naturally occurring biological strategy for inhibition of gene expression. In mammalian systems, however, the in vivo application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is severely limited by the instability and poor bioavailability of unmodified siRNA molecules. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a hydrophobically modified protein transduction domain, cholesteryl oligo-d-arginine (Chol-R9), may stabilize and enhance tumor regression efficacy of the VEGF-targeting siRNA.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-8, and bFGF levels were measured in mucosal extracts and cells and angiogenic bioactivity shown by induction of HIMEC migration and the corneal and chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assays.\nMicrovessel density was increased in IBD mucosa. Endothelial alphaVbeta3 was strongly expressed in IBD but only sporadically in normal mucosa and was up-regulated in HIMECs by VEGF, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and bFGF. IBD mucosal extracts induced a significantly higher degree of HIMEC migration than control mucosa, and this response was mostly dependent on IL-8 and less on basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor. Compared with normal mucosa, IBD mucosal extracts induced a potent angiogenic response in both the corneal and chorioallantoic membrane assays.\nThese results provide morphological, phenotypic and functional evidence of potent angiogenic activity in both CD and UC mucosa, indicating that the local microvasculature undergoes an intense process of inflammation-dependent angiogenesis.

A preliminary in vivo study.", "abstract": "According to the type of sequences used, either morphological or dynamic functional study can be performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study is to find out if vascular information found, in dynamic MR sequences, already exists in anatomical MR sequences in the particular case of Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (LCPD). LCPD is due to a loss of circulation to the femoral head in a growing child resulting in avascular necrosis and leading to possible distortion of size and shape of the proximal femur. MRI acquisitions consist in performing two anatomical sequences and one dynamic sequence with a gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) injection. Five new parametric images characterizing hyper- and hypo-vascularized areas are computed from the dynamic MR sequence. For each new image, the two corresponding anatomical images are found and registered. Then, four types of regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted: healthy hyper- and hypo-vascularized areas and pathological hyper- and hypo-vascularized areas. First-order statistical parameters and texture parameters (Haralick's method, run length method, fractal parameters, autoregressive factors and Laws' texture energy method) are computed in each ROI. Then, a statistical study based on a T test is performed. Results show that some parameters could discriminate the four ROI types. Hence, dynamic vascular image and intrinsic anatomical image characteristics seem to be correlated.

In vivo coronary vasculogenesis, which is a fast-occurring event, can be mimicked in vitro by culturing proepicardial tissue in different ways.

The main aim of this study is to study the triggering signals and the cellular dynamics that regulate the differentiation of proepicardial cells into the angioblastic/endothelial lineage and their in vitro vasculogenic potential. Our results indicate that hanging drop-cultured proepicardia, which have an intrinsic vascular potential, behave like self-assembling cell aggregates or spheroids that can fuse to give rise to complex vascularized 3D structures.

The respective buffers (40 mmol/l) were adjusted to pH 7.2, and sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium were present at standard concentrations. The mesenteric window model, based on observation of the translucent peritoneal sections of the small intestine mesentery, was used for immunohistochemical imaging of microvessels (RECA-1 antigen) and macrophages (ED1 and ED2 antigens). All fluids induced angiogenesis as compared with untreated controls. The lactate-buffered fluids induced larger vascularized zones than did their bicarbonate- and pyruvate-buffered counterparts. Angiogenesis was accompanied by a local recruitment of ED1 macrophages from blood.

This involves a dual mechanism of control through both stabilization and transactivation, regulated via prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. Despite high similarity with respect to protein sequence and activation pathway, a growing number of physiological and mechanistic differences between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are being reported. To further characterize this nonredundancy, the stabilization of endogenous proteins and regulation of the transactivation domains were compared in a graded oxygen environment across a series of cell lines. Although generally similar results were found, interesting and specific differences between the HIF-alpha proteins were observed within certain cell lines, such as rat adrenal PC12s, emphasizing the cell-specific nature of HIF-alpha regulation. We characterize a conserved amino acid substitution between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha that contributes to the intrinsically higher FIH-1-mediated asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha and, hence, lower HIF-1alpha activity. In addition, our data demonstrate that the different cell lines can be classified into two distinct groups: those in which stabilization and transactivation proceed in conjunction (HeLa, 293T, and COS-1) and those cells in which HIF-alpha is stabilized prior to transactivation (PC12, HepG2, and CACO2).

We have focused on the laminin alpha1 and alpha5 chains, the ancestral laminin alpha chains required for development. To elucidate the unique functions of laminin alpha1 and alpha5 and their COOH-terminal LG domains, we have produced a collection of laminin knockout and transgenic mice expressing full length and chimeric laminin alpha5/alpha1 chains. Crossing the transgenes onto the Lama5-/- background generates \"pseudo-knockins\", so called because endogenous laminin alpha5 is replaced by transgene-encoded proteins. Expression of a chimera with the entire alpha5LG domain replaced by alpha1LG had minimal ameliorative effects on the defects observed in Lama5-/- embryos.

{"title": "[Stem cells after myocardial infarction].", "abstract": "Loss of contractile myocardial tissue after myocardial infarction is followed by a remodeling of the left ventricle and clinical manifestation of heart failure, associated with a reduced life expectancy. One possibility to counteract the remodeling process would be to regenerate cardiomyocytes and to improve neovascularization in the infarct area. Indeed, experimental studies demonstrate that transplantation of adult stem or progenitor cells such as circulating, endothelial progenitor cells (CPCs) or progenitor cells derived from the bone marrow, is a therapeutic strategy to improve neovascularization and left ventricular (LV) function after myocardial infarction. First clinical trials in patients after an acute myocardial infarction indicate that intracoronary transplantation of adult progenitor cells is feasible and safe. Furthermore, patients treated with progenitor cells experienced an unexpectedly large improvement of LV function and geometry as well as vascularization, indicating a beneficial effect of the progenitor cell treatment on the postinfarction course. Randomized trials have obtained mixed results with respect to improvement of LV function after intracoronary infusion of progenitor cells, which may be due to methodological differences.

However, complications with catheter patency during the postoperative and/or experimental period often arise. In order to identify physiological occurrences common with such complications, 10 multicatheterized sheep (61.8 +/- 7.8 kg BW), obtained from a previous nutrient flux study were used for gross and histopathological investigation. Catheters had been surgically placed in a hepatic portal vein (PVC), a hepatic vein (HVC), a distal mesenteric vein (MVC) and a mesenteric artery (MAC). In the previous study, catheters (PVC, HVC and MAC) were used to collect blood samples or infuse (MVC) p-aminohippurate. Catheters were maintained for a total of 58 days prior to necropsy. Histopathological findings indicated that catheter failures were associated with the following tissue responses: (i) thromboses with frequent focal vasculitis; (ii) euplastic tissues associated with extensive fibrosis; (iii) granulomas; (iv) neo-vascularization of the media; (v) calcification processes; and (vi) micro-abscesses.

We have expanded outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from human peripheral blood and investigated their phenotypic stability in long-term cultures. Our goal has been to obtain suitable numbers of autologous endothelial cells for pro-angiogenic cell therapies. Mononuclear cells were isolated from human peripheral blood. During culture, cells were characterized for several endothelial and stem cell markers in mono- or in co-culture with mature endothelial cells. In cultures from peripheral blood, we observed cells with a variable ability to assume a differentiated endothelial phenotype. Most of the cells showed markers reported for endothelial progenitor cells or hemangioblasts (CD31, KDR, VE-cadherin, CD34, CD117, CD45) but failed to develop a differentiated phenotype. Caveolin-1 was not detectable in these cells by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunofluorescence. Another cell type arising from the same cultures expressed a differentiated phenotype and was designated as an OEC. This subset as an OEC was expanded in long-term cultures and analyzed by immunofluorescence, flow-cytometry, and RT-PCR for a stable endothelial phenotype. OEC showed several markers of a differentiated endothelium, such as high levels of caveolin-1 throughout all tested passages, and the ability to form angiogenic sprouts in vitro. Thus, OEC in long-term expansion cultures from blood mononuclear cells are phenotypically highly stable, a feature that is an important prerequisite for using OEC from peripheral blood for autologous endothelial cell therapies.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2006-06-01", "authors": ["SabineFuchs", "Maria IrisHermanns", "Charles JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-006-0222-4"}

The structural properties of the vascular networks were investigated by several multiscale methods such as fractal and power-spectrum analysis. These investigations gave a new coherent picture of normal and pathological complex vascular structures. They showed that normal cortical vascular networks have scale-invariant fractal properties on a small scale from 1.4 mum up to 40 to 65 mum. Above this threshold, vascular networks can be considered as homogeneous. Tumor vascular networks show similar characteristics, but the validity range of the fractal regime extend to much larger spatial dimensions.

{"title": "Microvascular system of anterior cruciate ligament in dogs.", "abstract": "This study was done to investigate the microvascular system of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using dogs. The objective was to study the microvascular architecture and the status of the barrier function of the capillary wall in the ACL by using microangiogram, scanning (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The vascular system in the ACL has been intensively studied by a number of researchers, using several microangiographic techniques in dogs, rabbits, and humans. However, most of these microangiographic studies had significant shortcomings, including the lack of three-dimensional observations and function of the blood-joint barrier in the ACL. In this study, the microstructure of the ACL was examined using microangiogram, SEM, and TEM. We investigated the vasculature of the ACL with SEM of vascular corrosion casts. In addition, we examined the status of the barrier function of the capillary wall in the ACL using the protein tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Feeding vessels of the ligament were predominantly coming from the synovial-derived vessels originating from the synovium attached to the ligament near the tibial and femoral bone insertions of the ACL. The anterior cruciate ligament was surrounded by synovium, which had abundant vessels. The branches of these synovial vessels were penetrating into the ligament and making the intrinsic vascular network. It was also ascertained under SEM that the perivascular space around the intrinsic vessels were communicating through the intrinsic ligament fiber bundles and the mesh-like synovial membrane. The capillaries in the ACL were all of the continuous type under TEM. The protein tracer that was injected into the joint space passed through the synovial membrane and entered into the capillary lumen in the ACL, but the tracer that was injected intravenously did not appear in the perivascular space. The existence of a blood-ACL barrier does not necessarily imply the existence of an ACL-blood barrier. We think that the blood flow in the ACL is definitely affected by the status of joint fluid and these barriers of endothelium.

The purpose of this study was to establish the role of the cellular fraction versus the microenvironment of LNs in the development of GVHD in this model.\nA rat model for vascularized LN transplantation was developed and graft-versus-host responses were compared after: 1) naive ACI LN cells were infused into Wistar-Furth (WF) rats as chimeric recipients (e.g. [ACI-->WF]); 2) vascularized WF lymph nodes were transplanted to syngeneic WF recipients; 3) nonvascularized ACI lymph nodes were transplanted to [ACI-->WF] chimeric recipients; 4) vascularized ACI lymph nodes were transplanted to [ACI-->WF] chimeric recipients.\nTransplantation of vascularized ACI lymph nodes to [ACI-->WF] chimeric recipient rats resulted in severe and sometimes lethal GVHD. In contrast, neither the infusion of purified ACI LN cells nor the transplantation of nonvascularized LNs led to GVHD in chimeric recipients.\nWhen introducing allogeneic cells into chimeric recipients, concomitant transplantation of the vascularized LN microenvironment makes a manifest difference between induction and absence of GVHD.

What is still not clear is how the system develops in the first place, and this limits its effective manipulation for the management of disease states. The aim of the current article is to summarize advances that have been made via genetic approaches using transgenic and knockout mice. It should be noted that studies of lymphatic vessel growth utilizing protein reagents or transgenic technology alone, in a tissue/cell culture environment, during tumor metastasis, in a lymphatic disease paradigm, or during tissue repair, have shown that various growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor BB (1), hepatocyte growth factor (2), fibroblast growth factor (3), and VEGF-A (4) appear to play a role.

Perhaps in part, because the smooth muscle band in the EBD wall is not well formed throughout the length of these structures, a previous definition of the outer portion of the bile duct wall included \"loose, richly vascularized connective tissue, interlaced with large nerve fibers.\" We have experienced difficulty in the application of these criteria in staging EBD carcinomas, which requires the histologic determination of the extent of the EBD wall. To systematically study the histologic features of EBD tissue boundaries, 34 EBD specimens obtained from autopsy were analyzed with attention to the distribution of blood vessels and nerve fibers along the length of this system. The EBD specimens were divided into lower, middle, and upper portions, and the locations of blood vessels and nerve fibers were then analyzed separately at each location. We defined the fibromuscular wall as the dense concentric arrangement of collagen and smooth muscle fibers surrounding the EBD mucosa. The location of blood vessels and nerve fibers was categorized as either (1) within, (2) junctional to, or (3) outside of the fibromuscular wall.

{"title": "Loss of tumor necrosis factor alpha potentiates transforming growth factor beta-mediated pathogenic tissue response during wound healing.", "abstract": "Animal cornea is an avascular transparent tissue that is suitable for research on wound healing-related scarring and neovascularization. Here we show that loss of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) potentiates the undesirable, pathogenic response of wound healing in an alkali-burned cornea in mice. Excessive invasion of macrophages and subsequent formation of a vascularized scar tissue were much more marked in TNFalpha-null knockout (KO) mice than in wild-type mice. Such an unfavorable outcome in KO mice was abolished by Smad7 gene introduction, indicating the involvement of transforming growth factor beta or activin/Smad signaling. Bone marrow transplantation from wild-type mice normalized healing of the KO mice, suggesting the involvement of bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells in this phenomenon. Co-culture experiments showed that loss of TNFalpha in macrophages, but not in fibroblasts, augmented the fibroblast activation as determined by detection of alpha-smooth muscle actin, the hallmark of myofibroblast generation, mRNA expression of collagen Ialpha2 and connective tissue growth factor, and detection of collagen protein. TNFalpha in macrophages may be required to suppress undesirable excessive inflammation and scarring, both of which are promoted by transforming growth factor beta, and for restoration of tissue architecture in a healing alkali-burned cornea in mice.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2006-05-26", "authors": ["ShizuyaSaika", "KazuoIkeda", "OsamuYamanaka", "Kathleen CFlanders", "YukaOkada", "TakeshiMiyamoto", "AiKitano", "AkiraOoshima", "YujiNakajima", "YoshitakaOhnishi", "Winston W-YKao"], "doi": "10.2353/ajpath.2006.050980"}
{"title": "Soluble multimer of recombinant endostatin expressed in E. coli has anti-angiogenesis activity.", "abstract": "The bioactivity, refolding, and multimer formation of endostatin, particularly of recombinant endostatin produced from bacteria, are proved challenging for clinical application. In order to determine the biological activity of recombinant endostatin multimer, first, we expressed endostatin in Escherichia coli and purified it with ion-exchange chromatography. The purified active protein could elicit multimer formation spontaneously, but still has comparable activity. Aim to determine the anti-angiogenic activity of multimer endostatin, by use of RP-HPLC, we then successfully separated endostatin monomer and multimer for subjecting to anti-angiogenesis assay. The results from CAM (chorioallantoic membrane) inhibition assay showed that both monomer and multimer suppressed CAM vascularization significantly. At the dosage of 0.8 microg, inhibition rates of multimeric and monomeric proteins were about 58% and 38%, respectively. Multimeric endostatin exerted a higher activity than monomeric endostatin (p < 0.05). However, when the protein dosage is less than 0.4 microg/ml, there is no significance between their inhibition rates (p > 0.05), although both of them show a high inhibition effect in contrast to control. The results from HUVEC proliferation assay also showed similar effects at dosages of 0.6 and 1.6 microg/ml, multimer exerted a higher activity on inhibition of HUVEC proliferation comparing with monomer (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that endostatin multimer has a comparable or higher bioactivity and multimerization will not affect its bioactivity, implying that endostatin activity is insensitive to structure conformation contributed by disulfide bonds.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2006-05-26", "authors": ["Dong-meiWei", "YanGao", "Xiang-rongCao", "Nian-chunZhu", "Jian-fuLiang", "Wei-pingXie", "Ming-yingZhen", "Min-shengZhu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.05.031"}

To investigate clinical utility, the authors systematically studied observer agreement on MVD and vascular patterns and the influence of repeatedly assessed data on patient outcomes in 2 independent glioblastoma series.\nMVD and vascular patterns were assessed retrospectively by 5 observers in 1) a retrospectively compiled glioblastoma series that included 110 patients and 2) a glioblastoma series that included 233 patients who were treated within a randomized trial. MVD was determined in the field of greatest density (\"hot-spot\"). Predominantly classic or bizarre vascular patterns were determined by using a previously defined algorithm.\nObserver agreement on MVD was highly variable (range of kappa values, 0.464-0.901). The worst observer agreement was achieved when both the selection of hot-spots and MVD counts were performed independently. Survival analysis did not show a consistent association between repeatedly assessed MVD and patient outcome. Observer agreement on vascular patterns was poor (kappa = 0.297). Survival analysis did not show a consistent association between repeatedly assessed vascular patterns and patient outcome.\nObserver agreement on hot-spot MVD and vascular patterns in patients with glioblastoma was poor in independent assessments. MVD and vascular patterns were not associated consistently with patient outcome.

Our strategy to acquire this bone substitute is using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 with beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) as carrier to induce bone tissue in muscle and grafting as a muscle-pedicled bone flap. In our previous studies, morphologically controlled living bone was successfully induced in a rat muscular pedicle. Moreover, concurrent administration of bisphosphonate controlled the subsequent resorption of the induced bone. This study was conducted (1) to confirm that when the size of carrier is increased, the induced bone can form the same in the center as well as on the periphery of the carrier, and (2) to simulate in vivo banking for vascularized autograft bone.\nIn experiment 1200 microg rhBMP-2 and 10(-5) M bisphosphonate (Minodronate) were applied to a 1-cm-diameter sphere of beta-TCP. This sphere was then inoculated into rabbit quadriceps and harvested 5 weeks later (n = 3). In experiment 2, beta-TCP was generated as a one-third hollow cylinder with 4-mm outer radius, 2-mm inner radius, and 10-mm length. After 50 microg rhBMP-2 and 10(-5) M Minodronate were applied, this structure was then inoculated into rat quadriceps.

{"title": "[Response to hypoxia. A systemic mechanism based on the control of gene expression].", "abstract": "New, critically important data have been recently generated about the response to hypoxia. This response can be schematized in three main systems or functions, ie, detectional or oxygen sensing, regulatory, which controls gene expression and effector. The principal organizer of the regulatory branch is a specific transcription factor, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). In the presence of oxygen, the alpha subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) is modified by hydroxylases, that represent the central point of the oxygen sensing mechanism. This type of hydroxylation induces HIF-1alpha catabolism by the proteosome. On the contrary, in hypoxia, or in the presence of certain growth factors that increase HIF-1alpha synthesis, HIF-1alpha translocates to the nucleus, where it binds HIF-1beta, and thence acts on transcription of genes carrying hypoxia responsive elements (HRE) on their promoters. These genes regulate the synthesis of an ample series of proteins, which span from respiratory enzymes and transporters to hormones regulating circulation and erythropoiesis. The role of HIF-1alpha is not restricted to the mere induction of adaptation to decreased oxygen: instead, it significantly participates in cell repairing mechanisms. A simple list of some of the stimulatory or inhibitory alterations of pathophysiological importance involving the HIF-1 system, would include: chronic lung disease, smoking adaptation, anemia/hemorrhage, ischemia/reperfusion, growth, vascularization and cell resistance of tumors, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation, retinal hyper o hypovascularization, drug intoxications, bowel inflammatory disease and wound repair.

The primary receptors for semaphorins are members of the plexin family. In particular, plexin-A1, together with ligand-binding neuropilins, transduces repulsive axon guidance signals for soluble class III semaphorins, whereas plexin-A1 has multiple functions in chick cardiogenesis as a receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6D, independent of neuropilins. Additionally, plexin-A1 has been implicated in dendritic cell function in the immune system. However, the role of plexin-A1 in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying its pleiotropic functions, remain unclear. Here, we generated plexin-A1-deficient (plexin-A1(-/-)) mice and identified its important roles, not only in immune responses, but also in bone homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that plexin-A1 associates with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (Trem-2), linking semaphorin-signalling to the immuno-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor protein, DAP12.

Quantitative fluorescence microscopy was done to morphometrically characterize lymphatic vessels in these tumors. Significant differences in vascular and extravascular transport variables as well as in lymphatic vessel morphology were detected between the two breast cancer models, which also exhibited significant differences in lymph node and lung metastasis. These data are consistent with a role of lymphatic drain in lymph node metastasis and suggest that increased lymph node metastasis may occur due to a combination of increased invasiveness, and reduced extracellular matrix integrity allowing increased pathways of least resistance for the transport of extravascular fluid, as well as tumor cells.

A foveal pit begins to form at Fd 135 in the center of the foveal avascular zone which is surrounded by a ring of blood vessels (BV) and astrocytes. At birth (Fd 144) the fovea has a single layer of cones over the pit center where the inner retinal layers are thinned but still separated. After birth the fovea rapidly matures so that foveal cone and pit morphology are similar to adult by 4 months. Five distinct layers and the BV plexus in the nerve fiber layer are present to the retinal edge in neonatal marmosets. Near the optic disc BV are sprouting into outer retinal layers at birth and vascularization of the outer retina is completed by 2 to 3 months. Retinal length increases sharply up to Fd 135, but undergoes a quiescent period around birth during which pit formation begins. Length then increases again up to 4mo, followed by a slow increase into adulthood. The postnatal increase is accompanied by a marked thinning of the peripheral retina. The pars plana appears after birth and its length increases at least until 2 years of age.

Perfusion bioreactors: a review.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering is a fast-evolving field of biomedical science and technology with future promise to manufacture living tissues and organs for replacement, repair, and regeneration of diseased organs. Owing to the specific role of hemodynamics in the development, maintenance, and functioning of the cardiovascular system, bioreactors are a fundamental of cardiovascular tissue engineering. The development of perfusion bioreactor technology for cardiovascular tissue engineering is a direct sequence of previous historic successes in extracorporeal circulation techniques. Bioreactors provide a fluidic environment for tissue engineered tissue and organs, and guarantee their viability, maturation, biomonitoring, testing, storage, and transportation. There are different types of bioreactors and they vary greatly in their size, complexity, and functional capabilities. Although progress in design and functional properties of perfusion bioreactors for tissue engineered blood vessels, heart valves, and myocardial patches is obvious, there are some challenges and insufficiently addressed issues, and room for bioreactor design improvement and performance optimization. These challenges include creating a triple perfusion bioreactor for vascularized tubular tissue engineered cardiac construct; designing and manufacturing fluidics-based perfused minibioreactors; incorporation of systematic mathematical modeling and computer simulation based on computational fluid dynamics into the bioreactor designing process; and development of automatic systems of hydrodynamic regime control. Designing and engineering of built-in noninvasive biomonitoring systems is another important challenge. The optimal and most efficient perfusion and conditioning regime, which accelerates tissue maturation of tissue-engineered constructs also remains to be determined.

{"title": "Reversal of diabetes by pancreatic islet transplantation into a subcutaneous, neovascularized device.", "abstract": "Transplantation of pancreatic islets for the treatment of type 1 diabetes allows for physiologic glycemic control and insulin-independence when sufficient islets are implanted via the portal vein into the liver. Intrahepatic islet implantation requires specific infrastructure and expertise, and risks inherent to the procedure include bleeding, thrombosis, and elevation of portal pressure. Additionally, the relatively higher drug metabolite concentrations in the liver may contribute to the delayed loss of graft function of recent clinical trials. Identification of alternative implantation sites using biocompatible devices may be of assistance improving graft outcome. A desirable bioartificial pancreas should be easy to implant, biopsy, and retrieve, while allowing for sustained graft function. The subcutaneous (SC) site may require a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthesia, but its use has been hampered so far by lack of early vascularization, induction of local inflammation, and mechanical stress on the graft.\nChemically diabetic rats received syngeneic islets into the liver or SC into a novel biocompatible device consisting of a cylindrical stainless-steel mesh. The device was implanted 40 days prior to islet transplantation to allow embedding by connective tissue and neovascularization.

Sequential images with an imaging time of 14.4s per dynamic image were acquired before and after injection of a contrast bolus at 30s and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. On postprocessing examination the following measurements were obtained for ovarian and muscle tissue: the signal intensity value per dynamic study, early phase enhancement rate, time to peak enhancement (Tp), and percentage of wash-out at the fifth minute were determined. Data of the ovaries and skeletal muscle were compared using Wilcoxon's rank sum test.\nMost of the mean values of the postcontrast signal intensity measurements, the mean values of the early phase enhancement rate, and the percentage of wash-out at the fifth minute were found to be significantly higher in ovary than in muscle (p<0.05). The mean values of Tp, on the other hand, were nonsignificantly lower in ovary than in muscle (p>0.05). On the examination of the mean signal intensity-time data graphics the ovary showed a tendency toward greater and quicker enhancement and wash-out.\nIn our opinion, DCE-MR imaging, which determines contrast enhancement such as wash-in and wash-out kinetics, can provide knowledge of ovarian vascularization. Thus, by using DCE-MR imaging, determination of these vascularization changes in various ovarian diseases may provide us with additional parameters in the diagnosis of and treatment strategies for ovarian diseases.", "journal": "European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology", "date": "2006-05-16", "authors": ["SadiGundogdu", "C ZuhalErdem", "L OktayErdem", "UlkuBayar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.03.017"}

There was a dramatic decrease in the density of superficial and deep vascular plexuses of the retina in transgenic mice. The retinal vessels in TSP1 transgenic mice also appeared nonuniform and abnormal in maturation. We detected an increase in the number of EC undergoing apoptosis, which was compensated, in part, by an increase in cell proliferation in retinal vasculature of TSP1 transgenic mice. The TSP1 transgenic mice also exhibited increased levels of vessel obliteration and a limited preretinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR).

We performed a qualitative analysis for abnormalities in collagen orientation, degree of vascularization, tenocyte cellularity, mucinous change, and chondroid metaplasia. Tendons were divided into three zones: tenosynovial lining cell layer, subtenosynovial lining cell layer, and tendon proper. All tendons showed neovascular infiltration causing collagen fibril disruption; 50% of specimens had diffuse involvement. Increased mucin content and chondroid metaplasia occurred in 28% and 36% of specimens, respectively. The tenosynovial lining cell layer showed hyperplasia in 28% of specimens. The subtenosynovial lining cell layer showed thickening and neovascularization in 79% of specimens, which appeared to be the source for the diffuse neovascular infiltrative process. There is little histopathologic evidence to support an inflammatory etiology to the posterior tibial tendons in acquired-adult flatfoot deformity.

However, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from diabetes are dysfunctional and impaired in ischemia-induced neovascularization.\nThis study aimed to confirm the compromised efficiency of diabetic M-PBMNCs in therapeutic neovascularization, and to determine the underlying mechanisms of this impairment.\nDiabetic M-PBMNCs from 17 diabetic patients or healthy controls, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the ischemic limbs of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nude mice. The limb blood perfusion, ambulatory score, ischemia damage, capillary/fiber ratio, arteriole density, collateral vessel formation, and pericytes recruitment were evaluated between these three groups. Non-invasive real time image and histopathology were used to detect the in vivo role of transplanted M-PBMNCs. Proliferation and adhesion of EPCs were assayed. In vitro vascular network incorporation and matrigel plug assay were used to test the pro-neovascularization role of M-PBMNCs.\nTransplantation of diabetic M-PBMNCs also improved neovascularization, but to a lesser extent from that observed with non-diabetic ones. This was associated with the impairment of diabetic M-PBMNCs capacity to differentiate into EPCs, to incorporate into vessel-like tubules in vitro, to participate in vascular-like structure formation in a subcutaneous matrigel plug, and to stimulate the recruitment of pericytes/smooth muscle cells. In addition, there was impairment in vasculogenesis, which was related to the reduced adhesion ability of EPCs from diabetic M-PBMNCs.\nDiabetes reduced the capacity of M-PBMNCs to augment neovascularization in ischemia.", "journal": "Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH", "date": "2006-05-13", "authors": ["BZhou", "Y YBi", "Z BHan", "HRen", "Z HFang", "X FYu", "M-CPoon", "Z CHan"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.01906.x"}

We determined the optimal dose and schedule of pegylated IFN-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) against U-87MG human glioblastoma cells growing orthotopically in nude mice, since several clinical trials reported that PEG-IFN-alpha administered at higher or lower doses was less effective. The group treated two times per week with injections of 10 KU of PEG-IFN-alpha for 4 weeks showed significant decreases in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Moreover, the optimal dose and schedule of PEG-IFN-alpha determined in this study and combined with paclitaxel treatment potently inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The mechanisms of the significant therapeutic effects were most likely caused by directly inhibiting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and rendering apoptosis increased. Specifically PEG-IFN-alpha/paclitaxel combination induced apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells more than that of tumor cells.

Consequently, isthmus-preserving total bilateral lobectomy (IPTB) may be regarded as an adequate surgical procedure for C-cell hyperplasia (CCH).\nIPTB was performed from October 2001 to December 2004 in 64 patients, 59 patients with nodular goiter and slightly to moderately elevated serum calcitonin (stimulated under 500 pg/ml) (group A, apparently sporadic cases) and in 5 patients undergoing prophylactic surgery for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with intermediate- or low-risk RET mutations (non-634) (group B). The surgical procedure focused on meticulous total extracapsular resection of both thyroid lobes, preservation of an isthmus remnant of about 3 ml (smaller in children), and histologic workup of the border zones of resection in addition to that of the completely removed lobes. When malignancy could be proven intraoperatively (7 patients) or when the isthmus turned out to contain nodular lesions (4 patients), completion total thyroidectomy (plus lymphadenectomy) was performed as a one-stage procedure. Second-stage total thyroidectomy was performed in 3 cases. Thus, IPTB was the definitive surgical procedure in 50 patients (45 of group A and all 5 of group B).\nIn all of the 50 definite IPTB cases, postoperative serum calcitonin was below the measurable limit (2 pg/ml); stimulated calcitonin was below the measurable limit in 47 (including all of group B) and was measurable in 3 sporadic cases in a lower-normal range between 2.4 and 3.5 pg/ml. Genetic screening of the apparently sporadic cases with CCH was positive in one (codon 791). The risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis seems not to be elevated (0% permanent); permanent hypocalcemia occurred in 1 patient (2%). Follow-up data of 37 patients, median 18 (6-36) months, showed continuously nonmeasurable serum calcitonin with one exception, where it was in the normal range after 18 months. All IPTB patients are still under substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (median 125 mug/day) with decreasing tendency in all 3 children after prophylactic operation, the latter also showing an increasing volume of well-vascularized isthmi (from 1.5 to 2.5 ml).\nIPTB reliably removes all C cells. There may not be need for total thyroidectomy (TTx) in cases with CCH. When necessary, completion TTx can be performed easily without additional risk. IPTB leaves a functionally relevant remnant, corresponding to that of a subtotal resection. This might be of importance especially for prophylactic surgery in children where the isthmus can compensate for the loss of thyroid function with time.", "journal": "World journal of surgery", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["Robert ArnulfWahl", "ChristianVorl\u00e4nder", "SusanneKriener", "JohannaPedall", "MartinSpitza", "Martin-LeoHansmann"], "doi": "10.1007/s00268-005-0424-z"}

In vitro, CEACAM1 regulates proliferation, migration, and differentiation of murine endothelial cells. To prove that CEACAM1 is functionally involved in the regulation of vascular remodeling in vivo, we analyzed 2 different genetic models: in Ceacam1-/- mice, the Ceacam1 gene was deleted systemically, and in CEACAM1(endo+) mice, CEACAM1 was overexpressed under the control of the endothelial cell-specific promoter of the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase. In Matrigel plug assays, Ceacam1-/- mice failed to establish new capillaries whereas in CEACAM1(endo+) mice the implants were vascularized extensively. After induction of hind limb ischemia by femoral artery ligation, Ceacam1-/- mice showed significantly reduced growth of arterioles and collateral blood flow compared with their WT littermates. In agreement with a causal role of CEACAM1 in vascular remodeling, CEACAM1(endo+) mice exhibited an increase in revascularization and collateral blood flow after arterial occlusion.

Forty-three patients received intensive medical therapy (conservative group) and 95 patients were treated aggressively (aggressive group).

Recently, the pineal secretory product melatonin was shown to stimulate the regeneration process. In this study, we carried out an experimental investigation of tail regeneration in young adult lizards, Ophisops elegans macrodactylus Berthold, 1842, addressing the role of melatonin on the regeneration process. Lizards were divided into three groups: constant light-exposed control group (n = 13), constant dark-exposed group (n = 15) and parachlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) treatment group exposed to constant light (n = 15). Using a tail autotomy procedure, the effects of p-CPA treatment on connective tissue together with neural tissue and vascular tissue in regenerating tail in lizards were investigated. p-CPA (400 microg/kg body mass) was injected from day 0 to 30 days after autotomy. p-CPA treatment produced a significant increase in the length of the regenerated tail compared with light-exposed control and dark-exposed lizards. Total collagen content was found to be higher in p-CPA-treated animals in comparison with other groups. Histologically, a higher percentage of connective tissue and vascular tissue and a lower percentage of neural tissue were found in the regenerated tails of the p-CPA-treated lizards. Importantly, the percentage of neural tissue in lizards in the dark-exposed animals was higher than that in animals of both light-exposed and p-CPA treatment groups. Thus, it is clear that p-CPA has a stimulatory influence on fibroblast collagen production and vascularization of the regenerated tail in the lizards. Furthermore, it seems that the neural regeneration process was markedly enhanced in lizards exposed to continuous darkness. Based on the results of our study, it is suggested that melatonin may be an active factor that speeds up the rate of tail regeneration in lacertilians.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["MTurgut", "SKaplan", "KMetin", "Y BKoca", "ESoylu", "BSahin", "Z B BAte\u015flier", "H KBa\u015falo\u011flu"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0264.2005.00653.x"}

(Vitaceae) has long been used in Chinese/Oriental herbal medicine for the treatment of cancer, but its active compounds and mechanisms of action have not been well studied. To this end, we isolated from its root heyneanol A (HA), which is a tetramer of resveratrol (RES), and established the in vivo antitumor activity of HA using the mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model. We administered HA and RES by daily intraperitonial injection to C57BL/6 mice that were subcutaneously inoculated with LLC cells. HA dose-dependently decreased tumor growth without any adverse effect on body weight and seemed more potent than RES. The tumor inhibitory effects were accompanied by a marked increase in tumor cell apoptosis detected by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL assays and decreased tumor cell proliferation index and tumor microvessel density, supporting the involvement of apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activities in the anticancer effects. We next investigated the cellular and molecular processes that mediate the apoptosis and anti-angiogenesis effects using cell culture models. Mechanistically, treatment of LLC cells in vitro with HA or RES significantly increased apoptotic cells. Both HA- and RES-induced cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and PARP were completely blocked by a pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In addition, HA and RES suppressed the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced proliferation and capillary differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and inhibited the binding of bFGF to its receptor in a test tube assay and the bFGF-induced vascularization of Matrigel plugs in vivo. Remarkably, HA was fairly stable in cell culture medium and did not undergo intracellular conversion to RES.

Their loss of hemoglobin (Hb) expression, and in some cases, loss of myoglobin (Mb) expression, has taught us much about the function of these proteins. Although absences of the proteins are fixed traits in icefishes, the losses do not appear to be of adaptive value. Contrary to some suggestions, loss of Hb has led to higher energetic costs for circulating blood, and losses of Mb have reduced cardiac performance. Moreover, losses of Hb and Mb have resulted in extensive modifications to the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to working muscles. Recent studies suggest that losses of Hb and Mb, and their associated nitric oxide (NO)-oxygenase activities, may have accelerated the development and evolution of these cardiovascular modifications. The high levels of NO that should occur in the absence of Hb and Mb have been shown in other animal groups to lead to an increase in tissue vascularization, an increase in the lumenal diameter of blood vessels, and an increase in mitochondrial densities. These characteristics are all hallmark traits of Antarctic icefishes.

{"title": "Estradiol and tamoxifen regulate endostatin generation via matrix metalloproteinase activity in breast cancer in vivo.", "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are important regulators of tumor progression and angiogenesis. MMPs generate both proangiogenic and antiangiogenic fragments, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and endostatin. The in vivo activation of MMPs and endostatin generation occur mainly in the extracellular environment by interactions of different cell types. Therefore, these processes are necessary to study in the extracellular space in vivo. Sex steroids play a dominant role in breast carcinogenesis, by largely unknown mechanisms. In the present study, we used in vivo microdialysis to directly quantify MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and sample endostatin from both stroma (murine) and tumor (human) cells in vivo in solid MCF-7 tumors in nude mice. We found that tamoxifen in combination with estradiol increased tumor MMP-2/MMP-9 in vivo activity, endostatin levels, and decreased tumor vascularization compared with estradiol treatment only. The stroma-derived endostatin was three to five times higher than cancer cell-generated endostatin. After inhibition of MMP-2/MMP-9, endostatin levels decreased, providing evidence that these proteases are highly involved in the generation of endostatin. Our results support the previously reported concept that MMPs may serve as negative regulators of angiogenesis.

In contrast, neurofibromas occur with high penetrance in mice in which Nf1 is ablated in Schwann cells in the context of a heterozygous mutant (Nf1+/-) microenvironment. Neurofibromas are highly vascularized, and recent studies suggest that Nf1+/- mice have increased angiogenesis in vivo.

In most cases this complication may be treated by simple debridement and antibiotic therapy, but sometimes it is necessary to fill the sternal defect with viable tissue. The greater omentum seems to be the ideal tissue to be transposed because of its malleability, good vascularization, and high lymphatic tissue content. The transposition of the greater omentum usually requires a midline laparotomy for the preparation of the flap, with significant laparotomy-related morbidity.

LIF injected either IP or IV had no effect on body weight or total retina area, but significantly increased the peripheral retinal avascular area. In both IP and IV injected groups there was no difference in the number of apoptotic cells between PBS- or LIF-injected groups; although in the p7/9 retinas, both injected groups had significantly more apoptotic cells than the non-injected group. In vitro, there was no effect of LIF on RMVEC apoptosis; however, cell counts were significantly lower in the LIF-treated group. Antibody to LIF restored the cell counts to untreated levels.

{"title": "Lysyl oxidase is essential for hypoxia-induced metastasis.", "abstract": "Metastasis is a multistep process responsible for most cancer deaths, and it can be influenced by both the immediate microenvironment (cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions) and the extended tumour microenvironment (for example vascularization). Hypoxia (low oxygen) is clinically associated with metastasis and poor patient outcome, although the underlying processes remain unclear. Microarray studies have shown the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) to be elevated in hypoxic human tumour cells. Paradoxically, LOX expression is associated with both tumour suppression and tumour progression, and its role in tumorigenesis seems dependent on cellular location, cell type and transformation status. Here we show that LOX expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and is associated with hypoxia in human breast and head and neck tumours. Patients with high LOX-expressing tumours have poor distant metastasis-free and overall survivals. Inhibition of LOX eliminates metastasis in mice with orthotopically grown breast cancer tumours. Mechanistically, secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic human cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and cell to matrix adhesion. Furthermore, LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth. Our findings indicate that LOX is essential for hypoxia-induced metastasis and is a good therapeutic target for preventing and treating metastases.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2006-04-28", "authors": ["Janine TErler", "Kevin LBennewith", "MonicaNicolau", "NadjaDornh\u00f6fer", "ChristinaKong", "Quynh-ThuLe", "Jen-Tsan AshleyChi", "Stefanie SJeffrey", "Amato JGiaccia"], "doi": "10.1038/nature04695"}

The soluble form of the VEGF receptor-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)) is known to regulate VEGF activity by binding VEGF in the circulation. We hypothesized that VEGF may be beneficial for maintaining glomerular filtration barrier and vascular network in rats with progressive glomerulonephritis (GN). For blockade of VEGF activity in vivo, rats were transfected twice with plasmid DNA encoding the murine sFlt-1 gene into femoral muscle 3 days before and 2 weeks after the induction of antiglomerular basement membrane antibody-induced GN. Inhibition of VEGF with sFlt-1 resulted in massive urinary protein excretion, concomitantly with downregulated expression of nephrin in nephritic rats. Further, blockade of VEGF induced mild proteinuria in normal rats. Administration of sFlt-1 affected neither the infiltration of macrophages nor crescentic formation. In contrast, treatment of sFlt-1 accelerated the progression of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis accompanied with renal dysfunction and PTC loss at day 56.

Radical resection of such axillary recurrences with concomitant reconstruction may not only yield significant palliation of symptoms but also improve disease-free survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of this radical surgical approach and help determine the risks and benefits for this patient population.\nA retrospective review of all patients who underwent axillary reexcision and reconstruction for metastatic melanoma between 1990 and 2000 was conducted at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Nine patients were identified who underwent flap reconstruction following radical excision of axillary recurrence after a previous lymphadenectomy.\nA total of 14 flaps were performed on the nine patients (five free flaps and nine pedicled muscle or myocutaneous flaps). Indications for surgery included pain, bleeding, and infection. Seven of the nine patients received perioperative radiation therapy. Palliation of symptoms was achieved in all patients. Free flap survival was 100 percent. Complications occurred in four of nine patients and included seroma, lymphedema, and wound dehiscence. Three patients had second local recurrences necessitating reresection and reconstruction; the mean time to rerecurrence was 6.7 months (range, 2 to 12 months). Four of nine patients were alive with no evidence of disease at the end of the follow-up period, with a mean disease-free interval of 41 months (range, 5 to 77 months). One patient was alive with distant metastasis, and four patients had died of distant metastases. The mean disease-free interval following original lymphedema for the nine patients was 11 months (range, 2 to 40 months).\nAggressive resection of axillary recurrence following lymphadenectomy can palliate symptoms in select individuals and may result in long-term disease-free survival.

Vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor were expressed in the graft mainly in the perinecrotic areas. Several capillaries inside the grafts were lined by continuous unfenestrated epithelium, while others were lined by fenestrated endothelium, suggesting that neovascularization is the result of two processes: ingrowths of capillaries from the renal capsule to the graft, and neoformation of capillaries from pre-existing adenohypophysial vessels.

Slit-lamp examination showed a central defect in the right corneal epithelium with underlying stromal opacification, only mild conjunctival inflammation with slight decreased tear production, and otherwise apparently normal eyes. Initially this was investigated as an infected ulcer and treated for several weeks as herpetic ulceration with no beneficial effect. Further clinical examination demonstrated bilateral decreased corneal sensation along with decreased facial sensation in keeping with congenital trigeminal nerve insufficiency. Investigation with magnetic resonance imaging showed no obvious abnormality. Conservative treatment with lubricants resulted in progressive right corneal stromal loss, and no healing occurred in the left corneal ulcer. Bilateral large lateral tarsorrhaphies were performed. Despite this, the left corneal ulcer demonstrated no improvement and increasing stromal opacification was noted. Topical nerve growth factor (NGF) was then used to treat the left cornea and resulted in epithelial healing within 1 week. Treatment was continued for a further 10 days after epithelial healing. Despite conventional treatment on 3 separate occasions, further epithelial breakdown occurred. Topical NGF treatment resulted in a rapid improvement and healing of the epithelial defect.'At present, the patient is receiving a 6-month continuous treatment plan of NGF.\nPersistent epithelial defects (PED) secondary to neurotrophic ulceration have responded to topical NGF on 3 separate occasions during a 2-year period. The corneal epithelium now remains intact, and the cornea has no vascularization; however, mild anterior stromal opacification has gradually increased despite prolonged NGF treatment.\nNGF seems to represent a safe and efficacious treatment option to restore the integrity of corneal epithelium in which there is congenital corneal anesthesia because of trigeminal insufficiency.

{"title": "[Salvage of digits replantations by direct arterial antithrombotic infusion].", "abstract": "At the end of the seventy, we saw the reconstructive microsurgery developed to such an extent that it became a new and an independent surgical specialty. The development of the microsurgical instrumentation and the description of the surgical anatomy allowed the application of this technology to the most complex plastic reconstructions and particularly to the replantation of the amputated digits, especially the very distal digital amputations. Nowadays, the indications of digital replantation are well-defined according to numerous parameters conditioning the anatomical result and the functional outcome. It is well-known that the replantation of the amputated digit should be realized as soon as possible with optimal conditions of digital hibernation during the patient transport. In spite of that technical progress, the failure rate is still relatively important. The causes are sometimes recognizable and connected to technical defection, such as a non permeable vascular anastomosis, bad hemodynamics conditions or an insufficient anticoagulation, while in certain cases, the digital ischemia occurs in spite of permeable and technically successful arterial anastomosis. We then consider a \"no reflow phenomenon\". It corresponds to the constitution of vascular microthrombi which will block the arteriolar network. Those microthrombi are inaccessible to the microsurgical techniques and their treatment remains medical by intra-arterial infusion of antithrombotic agents. Through our series of fifteen digital replantations, having suffered a \"no reflow phenomenon\", we are going to present the fibrinolytic protocol we used and the promising results we obtained. All our patients were victims of traumatisms associating avulsions and crush injuries mechanisms. The conditions of preservation of the amputated digits were all quite unfavourable: 1) the amputated digit soaked in water in 5 cases; 2) the amputated fingers underwent a long-term \"warm ischemia\" in three cases, going up to 13 hours for one of them; 3) the amputated digits were completely frozen in six cases; 4) and one amputated finger was correctly hibernated but for too long a period (8 hours). The signs of ischemia appeared very prematurely in the first minutes after the microvascular revascularisation in ten cases, and in average within three hours postoperatively in the other five cases, with extreme cases going from 2 up to 6 hours. As soon as the diagnosis of \"no reflow phenomenon\" was confirmed, an intra-arterial catheter was fixed. The radial axis was chosen as the arterial infusion way and approached at the level of the pulse groove. The antithrombotic protocol included a flash of 50,000 UI of urokinase, 36 ml of lidoca\u00efne 1% and 40 mg of enoxaparine, followed by an electric syringe infusion the first six hours with 150,000 UI of urokinase, 36 ml of lidoca\u00efne 1% and 40 mg of enoxaparine at 6 cc/h speed. The urokinase was then interrupted but the intra-arterial infusion maintained with 72 ml of lidoca\u00efne 1% and 80 mg of enoxaparine for 24 hours, at a 3 cc/h speed, and this for ten days. In 12 cases, the \"no reflow phenomenon\" was able to be raised and the digital vascularization restored. The success rate is very encouraging (80%) and it turns this protocol into a precious ally of the digit replantation microsurgery and an effective therapeutic means way against the \"no reflow phenomenon\".", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2006-04-22", "authors": ["AOufquir", "JBakhach", "BPanconi", "J-CGuimberteau", "JBaudet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anplas.2005.12.017"}

Morphology, signal intensities, and contrast-enhancement of the femoral head were assessed by two radiologists in consensus. Morphologic distortion of the physis, bone marrow edema within the metaphysis and epiphysis, and joint effusion were the preoperative MRI findings of SCFE in each child. In nine children, the vascularization of the femoral head before and after surgery was normal. In one child, a preoperative avascular zone in the superolateral aspect of the epiphysis revascularized completely after surgery.

{"title": "Hormonal regulation of placental nitric oxide and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.", "abstract": "The placenta is central to foetal growth and development in mammalian pregnancy. Compromised placental function (as found in pre-eclampsia) often results in life-threatening situations for both mother and foetus. The nitric-oxide (NO) signalling cascade is important for placental function, in particular for the development of the vascular network and for maintaining vascular tone.

Whether NH-induced leukocyte activation and sequestration can affect extrapulmonary organs or blood cellular profile has not been systematically investigated. We studied simultaneous changes in blood cellular profile and pulmonary, renal, and intestinal histology during NH and after return to air breathing (\"weaning\").\nOne-day-old rats were exposed to 2 to 4 days of NH (FiO2 >0.98) or normoxia (FiO2 = 0.21), with or without weaning. Pups were then euthanized and 100 microL of blood was collected (cardiac puncture) for differential white blood cells analysis (n = 12 per group). The lungs, a piece of distal ileum, and the left kidney were removed for histologic evaluation.\nBoth NH and weaning generated significant increases in blood neutrophil count, whereas lymphocyte population was significantly increased only after weaning (P < .05; analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Normobaric hyperoxia created mild increases in the renal tubular necrosis, dilation, regeneration, and interstitial inflammation. A significant increase in the intestinal serosal and submucosal vasodialation and vascularization occurred 1 day after weaning from 4 days of NH (P < .001). These extrapulmonary events coincided with the development of histologic manifestations of pulmonary oxygen toxicity.\nDevelopment of pulmonary oxygen toxicity in neonatal rats is associated with significant changes in differential leukocyte counts and histologic alterations in the kidney and ileum.

For the follow up of all these patients, Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy was performed between 2-10 days postoperatively. SPECT study was included in 5 patients. For the evaluation of the grafts, a six-grade scoring system was used. The grading system was based on a comparison of tracer uptake between graft and the cranium. The uptake was defined as increasing from grade 6 to grade 1.\nThirteen of the 16 grafts had an uncomplicated clinical course. Complications in the graft occurred in three patients. In the analysis of planar scintigrams, patients with uncomplicated healing showed increased uptake in 12 of the 13 grafts (grade 1-3) and 1 showed the same level tracer uptake compared to cranium (grade 4). In the failed 3 grafts, decreased uptake was observed (grade 5 and 6). In 5 patients, SPECT was performed in addition to planar imaging. In these patients, 4 of the 5 grafts had an uncomplicated clinical course and 1 had a complicated one. In the analysis of SPECT images, while all the grafts with an uncomplicated clinical course exhibited increased uptake (grade 1-3), the failed graft showed decreased uptake (grade 6).\nThree-phase bone scintigraphy performed within 10 days after the mandibular reconstruction is a useful tool to monitor the viability and early complications of vascularized mandibular bone grafts.

Interference with N-glycosylation has been shown both to reduce the membrane expression of MHC class I and to increase the in vitro sensitivity of tumor cells to NK cell killing. We investigated the effect of O-glycosylation inhibition on the in vivo growth, phenotype and NK sensitivity of RMA lymphoma cells using benzyl N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamide (BAG). BAG-treated cells were found to have a strongly reduced local growth potential in vivo. However, inhibition of O-glycosylation caused this effect without any significant downregulation of MHC-I and increase in sensitivity to NK killing as seen after inhibition of N-glycosylation using Castanospermine. BAG treatment of RMA cells resulted in the removal of larger O-linked glycans and a high expression of the T-antigen (GalGalNAc), a target for natural antibodies (NAs) induced by the gastrointestinal bacterial flora. Whether the loss of larger O-linked glycans, and associated functions, or of biological effects of NA contributed to the antitumor effect remains to be established.

The in vitro study showed bioactivity when the glass-coated samples were left in SBF for 5 days. This was confirmed by FTIR results, which presented P--O vibration bands characteristic of hydroxyapatite close to 1060 cm(-1) and 600 cm(-1).

Angiogenesis, as determined by hemoglobin content extracted from implants 7 and 14 days after implantation, increased progressively in both glass-coated and glass-free collagen implants. However, vascularization was higher in the glass-coated collagen implants 14 days after implantation (mug Hb per mg wet tissue 6.0 +/- 0.3) compared with the glass-free group (1.6 +/- 0.1).

Previous studies indicated that the VEGF homolog placental growth factor (PlGF) has a more significant role in disease than in health. Therefore we investigated the role of PlGF in a model of semi-stabilized bone fracture healing. Fracture repair in mice lacking PlGF was impaired and characterized by a massive accumulation of cartilage in the callus, reminiscent of delayed- or nonunion fractures. PlGF was required for the early recruitment of inflammatory cells and the vascularization of the fracture wound. Interestingly, however, PlGF also played a role in the subsequent stages of the repair process. Indeed in vivo and in vitro findings indicated that PlGF induced the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors and stimulated cartilage turnover by particular MMPs. Later in the process, PlGF was required for the remodeling of the newly formed bone by stimulating osteoclast differentiation. As PlGF expression was increased throughout the process of bone repair and all the important cell types involved expressed its receptor VEGFR-1, the present data suggest that PlGF is required for mediating and coordinating the key aspects of fracture repair.

In two patients, the vascularized graft transfer was preceded by other operations. All patients but one had Crawford type IV pseudarthrosis. The signs of peripheral neurofibromatosis were found in four of the five patients.\nThe operation was carried out by two surgical teams, i. e., orthopedic and microsurgery (plastic surgery) specialists. Deep dissection of the pseudarthrosis was performed down to healthy, well vascularized tissue; a vascularized pedicle bone graft was harvested from the contralateral fibula. The graft was inserted and anchored intramedullarily in both tibial fragments, and stability was provided with a K-wire introduced through the calcaneus. Subsequently, the vascular pedicle of the fibular graft was joined to the surrounding vessels (anterior tibial artery and anterior tibial vein). The extremity was immobilized in plaster cast and later a KAFO brace was applied.\nGraft union partially failed in the proximal end of the graft due to bone resorption of both the graft and the proximal tibial fragment in two patients. This was successfully treated by additional spongioplasty. In all patients bony union was achieved at an average time of 9.8 months (range, 6 to 21 months). An increase by more than 100 % in the diameter of the transplanted fibula was recorded in four patients. The increase, which was of course related to follow-up time, was a clear proof of primary graft vascularization.\nThe use of vascularized fibular graft harvested from the contralateral extremity showed high effectiveness in comparison with other methods.

Exposure of mature aortic endothelial cells to netrin-1 resulted in a potent, dose-dependent increase in NO* production, detected by electron spin resonance. Scavenging NO* with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) abolished netrin-1 stimulated angiogenesis. Netrin-1-stimulated NO* production or angiogenesis was inhibited by DCC antibody, DCC small interfering RNA (siRNA), specific inhibitors (PD98059, U0126), or siRNAs for MEK1/2. PTIO attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating a feed-forward mechanism. Netrin-1 induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS(s1179, s116) and a rapid dephosphorylation of eNOS(t497).

{"title": "Pharmaceutical interventions to influence arteriogenesis: new concepts to treat ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Despite the technical progress in interventional techniques to overcome the harmful effects of ischemic heart disease there is still an urgent need for alternative, pharmaceutical treatment modalities. Exogenous stimulation of vessel growth, i.e. vasculogenesis, angiogenesis or arteriogenesis serves as a promising strategy to restore blood flow to the jeopardized tissue regions downstream of arterial stenosis or occlusion. While vasculogenesis is defined as the arrangement of angioblasts during prenatal development creating the first vascular network, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis refer to important adaptive mechanisms in the adult organism. Angiogenesis, neo-formation of capillaries, is a key process in many different physiological and pathophysiological events where improvement of microvascular function and tissue nutrition is needed (e.g. wound healing, tumor growth). In contrast to this capillary sprouting, the term arteriogenesis refers to the development of large caliber collateral arteries. Under conditions of increasing shear stress, anastomoses between interconnected perfusion territories can undergo adaptive enlargement, developing into a functional network of collateral arteries, natural bypasses able to maintain sufficient blood flow and compensating for the gradual occlusion of a large artery (e.g. in the coronary circulation). However, in most cases arteriogenesis does not proceed as fast as the stenosis progresses and infarction and tissue necrosis results. A well-developed collateral network is an important protective factor for the occurrence of ischemic events and therefore pharmaceutical acceleration and stimulation of arteriogenesis in patients represents an eminent aim for the future.

The surgical specimen was processed for routine histology and immunohistochemical studies. The cytologic smears were adequately cellular, showing spindly cells with uniform, elongated nuclei; small, inconspicuous nucleoli; and scanty, wispy cytoplasm associated with myxoid material. No significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitoses were noted. The excised tumor was well circumscribed, focally infiltrating the surrounding muscles. The cut surface was variable, featuring fibrous, solid, fleshy and myxoid areas. Microscopically, the solid, fibrous areas displayed increased cellularity with storiform, intersecting and parallel patterns. In the myxoid areas the cells grew in a haphazard fashion and appeared floating in abundant mucoid matrix associated with a capillary vascular network similar to the chicken-wire pattern seen in cases of myxoid liposarcoma.

This likely reflects the requirements of the organ for a rich supply of nutrients and oxygen to the tissue, as well as the need for rapid disposal of metabolites and secreted hormones. The islet endothelium is richly fenestrated to facilitate trans-endothelial transport of secreted hormones, has a unique expression of surface markers, and produces a number of vasoactive substances and growth factors. The islet endothelial cells play a critical role in the early phase of type 1 diabetes mellitus by increasing the expression of surface leucocyte-homing receptors, thereby enabling immune cells to enter the endocrine tissue and cause beta-cell destruction. Following transplantation, pancreatic islets lack a functional capillary system and need to be properly revascularized.

To be successful, the embolization of arteriovenous malformations and fistulas must achieve obliteration of the arteriovenous shunts themselves rather than simply occlude the feeders proximal to the lesion. However, the feeders cannot always be negotiated over their entire length. This is often the case with dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF), which are usually vascularized by long and intricate meningeal networks. In such situations, NBCA may not be able to reach the lesion itself, rendering the embolization ineffective. We present a new technique that improves distal distribution of NBCA glue.\nThe technique described in this report consists of injecting dextrose 5% through the guiding catheter simultaneously with the superselective injection of NBCA glue into the targeted feeding branch. The technique is illustrated with three cases of posterior fossa DAVF.\nIn the reported cases, flooding the territory of the targeted vessel with non-ionic dextrose 5% allowed deep progression of the glue by delaying contact with ionic substances. Excellent distribution of the NBCA glue reaching the site of the arteriovenous shunts was thus obtained despite suboptimal proximal microcatheter tip positions.\nSimultaneous perfusion of dextrose 5% through the guiding catheter during NBCA injection dramatically improves the distal progression of glue through small, tortuous arterial feeders. This technique has the potential to increase the therapeutic value of transarterial embolization for DAVFs.", "journal": "Neuroradiology", "date": "2006-04-12", "authors": ["CarolynMoore", "KieranMurphy", "PhilippeGailloud"], "doi": "10.1007/s00234-006-0059-2"}

We addressed these issues by studying systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and VEGF expression in rats with different degrees of portal hypertension. Portal vein ligation (PVL) performed over needles of three different calibers (16-, 18-, and 20-gauge) yielded different degrees of PHT and portosystemic shunting. Compared with sham rats, all three groups of PVL rats exhibited features of hyperdynamic circulation. Rats with minimal portal hypertension (PVL with a 16-gauge needle) showed an early increase in VEGF and eNOS expression selectively at the jejunum. Immunofluorescence showed that VEGF expression was located in highly vascularized areas of the mucosa. Inhibition of VEGF signaling markedly attenuated the increase in eNOS expression. In conclusion, mild increases in portal pressure are enough to upregulate eNOS at the intestinal microcirculation, and this occurs, at least in part, through VEGF upregulation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Our study analyzed the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and its functional receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1, in the cochlear structures of noise-exposed and unexposed guinea pigs. VEGF is a prototypical angiogenic agent, with multiple functions on vascular biology, ranging from vascular permeability to endothelial cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Acoustic trauma was induced by a continuous pure tone of 6 kHz, at 120 dB SPL for 30 min. Auditory function was evaluated by electrocochleographic recordings at 2-20 kHz for 7 days. Noise-induced cochlear morphological changes were studied by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. The expression of VEGF and its receptors was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis. The hearing threshold shift reached a level of 60 dB SPL on day 1 after trauma and underwent a partial recovery over time, reaching a value of about 20 dB SPL on day 7. Outer hair cell loss was more prominent in the area located 14-16 mm from the apex. Increased cochlear VEGF expression was observed in noise-exposed animals, in particular at the level of stria vascularis, spiral ligament, and spiral ganglion cells.

To test these hypotheses, we obtained human atrial appendage tissue at the time of cardiac bypass. Fragments of atrial tissue were then incorporated into fibrin thrombin clots. Tissue fragments were observed, and the percent of wells that developed neovessel invasion into the clot was calculated (%I).

To determine whether AGT can exert an antitumoral effect through its antiangiogenic properties, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus carrying the human angiotensinogen gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (AdAGT). In vitro studies showed that AdAGT selectively inhibited endothelial cell proliferation. In vivo, injections of AdAGT into preestablished human MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinomas in nude mice inhibited tumor growth by 70% compared to controls, with 21% total regression. This effect was associated with the suppression of intratumoral vascularization and marked necrosis. Furthermore, in vitroAdAGT infection of MDA-MB-231 and murine melanoma B16F10 cells strongly blocked their in vivo tumorigenicity. Then, in mice expressing high levels of AGT (i.e., either iv injected with AdAGT or HuAGT transgenic mice), the number of B16F10 pulmonary metastases was 85% lower than in control C57BL/6 mice.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of bFGF in developing rodent kidneys induces cyst formation in vivo. We used two different adenoviral-mediated gene-transferring approaches to overexpress bFGF in developing rodent kidneys. Initially, metanephric kidney (MK) explants harvested from embryonic day 15 Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with adenoviral vectors (rAd) encoding human bFGF or LacZ genes and transplanted under the renal capsule of adult female rats. Subsequently, to determine whether bFGF could induce renal cysts in developing kidneys with an intact renal collecting system, we injected rAd-bFGF or LacZ vectors in the retroorbital plexus of newborn mice. Basic FGF induced a more efficient integration of the MK explants into the host kidneys and increased the vascularization and proliferation of developing tubules, leading to tubular dilatation and rapid formation of renal cysts. In addition, we successfully expressed human bFGF in the kidney of newborn mice in vivo and induced tubular dilatation and renal cysts. In contrast, mice injected with rAd-lacZ did not develop tubular dilatation or renal cysts.

Pathologic angiogenesis takes place in chronic arthritis, collagen diseases, arteriosclerosis, retinopathy associated with diabetes, and particularly in cancers. However, angiogenesis as a physiological process regularly occurs in the ovary. After ovulation the corpus luteum is formed by rapid vascularization of initially avascular granulosa lutein cell tissue. This process is regulated by gonadotropic hormones. In order to gain further insights in the regulatory mechanisms of angiogenesis in the ovary, we investigated these mechanisms in cell culture of human granulosa lutein cells. In particular, we determined the expression and production of several angiogenic factors including tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), Leptin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), meningioma-associated complimentary DNA (Mac25), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and Midkine. In addition, we showed that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has distinct effects on their expression and production. hCG enhances the expression and production of TIMP-1, whereas it downregulates the expression of CTGF and Mac25. Furthermore it decreases the expression of Leptin. Our results provide evidence that hCG determines growth and development of the corpus luteum by mediating angiogenic pathways in human granulosa lutein cells.

Since increased HIF-1 expression correlates with advanced disease stage, increased angiogenesis and poor prognosis, HIF-1 and its signaling pathway have become targets for cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we identified noscapine to be a novel small molecule inhibitor of the HIF-1 pathway based on its structure-function relation-ships with HIF-1 pathway inhibitors belonging to the benzylisoquinoline class of plant metabolites and/or to microtubule binding agents. We demonstrate that noscapine treatment of human glioma U87MG and T98G cell lines exposed to the hypoxic mimetic agent, CoCl2, inhibits hypoxia-mediated HIF-1alpha expression and transcriptional activity as measured by decreased secretion of VEGF, a HIF-1 target gene. Inhibition of hypoxia-mediated HIF-1alpha expression was due, in part, to its ability to inhibit accumulation of HIF-1alpha in the nucleus and target it for degradation via the proteasome. One mechanism of action of microtubule binding agents is their antiangiogenic activity associated with disruption of endothelial tubule formation. We show that noscapine has similar properties in vitro. Thus, noscapine may possess novel antiangiogenic activity associated with two broad mechanisms of action: first, by decreasing HIF-1alpha expression in hypoxic tumor cells, upregulation of target genes, such as VEGF, would be decreased concomitant with its associated angiogenic activity; second, by inhibiting endothelial cells from forming blood vessels in response to VEGF stimulation, it may limit the process of neo-vascularization, correlating with antitumor activity in vivo. For more than 75 years, noscapine has traditionally been used as an oral cough suppressant with no known toxic side effects in man. Thus, the studies reported here have found a novel function for an old drug.

Unfortunately, a large gap still exists in the medical knowledge base that serves to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic degeneration. Because disc degeneration per se is not a basis for clinical intervention, identification of specific features underlying discogenic pain is of the utmost importance to advance the current level of care and identify novel therapeutic targets. This article presents animal-model evidence that pathologic, or painful, degeneration is characterized by ineffective injury-healing of peripheral tissue. Because the disc is only vascularized at the vertebral end plate and the outer part of the anulus, these are the likely sites for focal damage, inflammation, neoinnervation, and nociceptor sensitization.

Archival tissues included perithymic, periadrenal, axillary, and neck adipose tissue in which were embedded nests of brown fat (n = 15), hibernoma (n = 3), lipoma (n = 6), well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 4), and myxoid liposarcoma (n = 4).\nInvariably, multivacuolated and univacuolated adipocytes of normal brown fat and hibernomas were intensely positive for the CD31 antigen.

No expression of CD31 was found in normal adipocytes of white fat, in neoplastic cells of lipomas, or in multivacuolated lipoblasts of well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas.\nThe spectrum of cell types that express CD31 is expanded to include normal and neoplastic brown fat cells. We speculate that the expression of CD31 may play a role in the development and maintenance of the vascular network characterizing this specialized adipose tissue. Moreover, CD31 may inhibit the Bax-mediated apoptosis of brown fat cells.

Microvascular free-tissue transfer increases the ability to close wounds, transfer vascularized bone, and prevent amputation, yet remains a complex, invasive procedure with significant complication rates, donor-site morbidity, and failure rates. This review documents the changing treatment protocol in the authors' institution for these injuries.\nTwo hundred ninety consecutive open tibia-fibula fractures over a 12-year period (1992 to 2003) were retrospectively reviewed and methods and outcomes were compared by grouping the fractures into 4-year intervals.\nThe number of open lower extremity fractures increased, whereas the distribution of Gustilo grade I to III fractures remained unchanged. Overall, free-tissue transfer was performed less frequently and constituted 20 percent of reconstructions in period 1 (1992 to 1995), 11 percent in period 2 (1996 to 1999), and 5 percent in period 3 (2000 to 2003). For the most severe fractures, Gustilo grade III, free-flap reconstruction has decreased significantly, constituting 42 percent, 26 percent, and 11 percent of procedures in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Local flaps for grade III fractures have remained relatively constant throughout the study. In contrast, local wound care for grade III fractures, including skin grafts, delayed primary closures, and secondary intention closures has significantly increased from 22 percent to 49 percent of reconstructions from periods 1 through 3. In 1997, the authors began to use the vacuum-assisted closure device and now use it in nearly half of all open fractures. Despite this trend, there has been no change in infection, amputation, or malunion/nonunion rates and a decrease in reoperation rate with at least 1-year follow-up.\nThese results demonstrate a change in practice, with a trend down the reconstructive ladder, currently using fewer free flaps and more delayed closures and skin grafts with frequent use of the vacuum-assisted closure sponge. Possible reasons for this change are a better understanding of lower leg vascular anatomy and better use of improved wound care technology.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2006-04-04", "authors": ["Brian MParrett", "EvanMatros", "Julian JPribaz", "Dennis POrgill"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000204959.18136.36"}

To date, functional testicular tissue has not yet been generated in vitro. The objective of this study was to explore the de novo morphogenesis of testicular tissue from isolated postnatal rat testicular cells using a combination of in vitro culture and ectopic xenografting. Immature rat testicular cells were cultured in either a 2-dimensional (laminin-coated coverglass) or a 3-dimensional (extracellular matrix gel) culture system. Whereas testicular cells cultured on laminin showed a slow morphogenetic cascade resulting in cord formation after about 10 days of culture, cells cultured on extracellular matrix gel assembled to a network of cordlike structures within several hours after plating and formed spherical cell aggregates at day 3. Further progression of the morphogenetic cascade was not obtained in either the 2- or the 3-dimensional culture system. In contrast, structures resembling immature testicular tissue were obtained after xenografting of extracellular matrix gel-enclosed spherical testicular cell aggregates. The grafts were vascularized and contained elongated seminiferous tubules. Histologic analysis revealed the presence of a basement membrane, a histologically normal interstitium containing putative Leydig cells, the establishment of tubule lumen, and the integration of few putative spermatogonia into the seminiferous epithelium. We conclude that immature rat testicular cells carry the full potential to generate all somatic components of a testis in xenografts, thus opening fascinating pathways to study testicular organogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of andrology", "date": "2006-04-04", "authors": ["KathrinGassei", "StefanSchlatt", "JensEhmcke"], "doi": "10.2164/jandrol.05207"}

{"title": "Aquaporin-1 in the peritoneal membrane: Implications for water transport across capillaries and peritoneal dialysis.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established mode of renal replacement therapy, based on the exchange of fluid and solutes between blood in peritoneal capillaries and a dialysate that has been introduced in the peritoneal cavity. The dialysis involves diffusive and convective transports and osmosis through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. Computer simulations predicted that the membrane contains ultrasmall pores (radius < 3 A) responsible for the transport of solute-free water across the capillary endothelium during crystalloid osmosis. The distribution of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1), as well as its molecular structure ensuring an exquisite selectivity for water perfectly fit with the characteristics of the ultrasmall pore. Treatment with corticosteroids induces the expression of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries and increases water permeability and ultrafiltration in rats, without affecting the osmotic gradient and the permeability for small solutes. Studies in knockout mice provided further evidence that osmotically-driven water transport across the peritoneal membrane is mediated by AQP1. AQP1 and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) show a distinct regulation within the endothelium lining peritoneal capillaries. In acute peritonitis, the upregulation of eNOS and increased release of NO dissipate the osmotic gradient and result in ultrafiltration failure, despite the unchanged expression of AQP1. These data illustrate the potential of the peritoneal membrane to investigate the role and regulation of AQP1 in the endothelium. They also emphasize the critical role of AQP1 during peritoneal dialysis and suggest that manipulating AQP1 expression may be used to increase water permeability across the peritoneal membrane.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2006-04-04", "authors": ["OlivierDevuyst", "JieNi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.02.025"}
{"title": "Loss of Cited2 affects trophoblast formation and vascularization of the mouse placenta.", "abstract": "Cited2 is widely expressed in the developing embryo and in extraembryonic tissues including the placenta. Gene expression can be induced by a number of factors; most notably by the hypoxia inducible transcription factor, HIF1, under low oxygen conditions. Cited2 encodes for a transcriptional co-factor that in vitro can act as both a positive and negative regulator of transcription. This function is due to its interaction with CBP/p300 and appears to depend on whether Cited2 enables CBP/p300 to interact with the basic transcriptional machinery, or if its binding prevents such an interaction from occurring. Here, we report a novel function for Cited2 in placenta formation, following gene deletion in mouse. In the absence of Cited2 the placenta and embryo are significantly small from 12.5 and 14.5 dpc respectively, and death occurs in utero. Cited2 null placentas have fewer differentiated trophoblast cell types; specifically there is a reduction in trophoblast giant cells, spongiotrophoblasts and glycogen cells. In addition, the fetal vasculature of the placenta is disorganised and there are fewer anastomosing capillaries. Given that Cited2 is expressed in both trophoblasts and the fetal vasculature, the observed defects fit well with the sites of gene expression.

Current models of islet cell transplantation (release into the portal venous system, placement under the renal capsule, and microencapsulation) lack these qualities. We have developed a model of angiogenesis and spontaneous tissue generation in the rat that lends itself as a potential platform for tissue engineering. In this experiment, we examined the effectiveness of such a model in addressing some of the shortcomings of endocrine pancreatic transplantation. An arteriovenous loop was created in the groins of five adult inbred Sprague-Dawley rats, and placed within polycarbonate chambers. Isolated pancreatic islet cell clusters were placed within the chambers, suspended in a matrix of Matrigel\u00ae. The chambers were recovered at 3 weeks, and the newly generated tissue was processed for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. By 3 weeks, spontaneous generation of angiogenesis and collagen matrix and deposition of a collagen matrix was observed. Surviving islet cells were identified by histology and their viability was confirmed via immunohistochemistry for insulin and glucagon. This study demonstrates the ability to maintain viability and functionality of transplanted islet cells on a tissue-engineered platform with an independent vascular supply. The model provides the ability to alter the graft environment via matrix substitution, cellular coculture, and administration of growth factors.

Livers, bone marrow, and peripheral blood from rats at 24 h to 14 days after an injection of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) were examined by light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural methods. Numerous ED-1 (a marker for rat monocytes/macrophages)-positive round mononuclear cells infiltrated in the necrotic areas at 36 h after DMN treatment. On day 5, when necrotic tissues were removed, some of the cells were transformed from round to spindle in shape. On day 7, these cells were contacted with residual reticulin fibers and became positive for SE-1, a marker of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and Tie-1, an endothelial cell-specific surface receptor, associated with frequent occurrence of ED-1/SE-1 and ED-1/Tie-1 double-positive spindle cells. Ultrastructurally, the spindle cells simultaneously showed phagocytosis and endothelial cell-like morphology. With time necrotic areas diminished, and on day 14, the necrotic tissues were almost replaced by regenerated liver tissues and thin bundles of central-to-central bridging fibrosis. Bone marrow from 12 h to day 2 showed an increase of BrdU-positive mononuclear cells. Some of them were positive for ED-1. The BrdU-labeled and ED-1-positive cells appeared as early as 12 h after DMN injection and reached a peak in number at 36 h. They were similar in structure to ED-1-positive cells in necrotic liver tissues. These findings suggest that round mononuclear ED-1-positive cells proliferate first in bone marrow after DMN treatment, reach necrotic areas of the liver through the circulation, and differentiate to sinusoidal endothelial cells.

The thinner slices allow a better spatial resolution, and slice fusion allows improved contrast resolution. The isotropic voxel has been realized in the latest 64-channel scanners. The image quality of arbitrarily reconstructed planes has arrived at the image quality of the scan plane. Faster scanning allows studies in different contrast phases, which is helpful for better discrimination of benign or malignant lesions especially in the highly vascularized kidney. Different phases of contrast uptake can be differentiated (arterial, cortico-medullary, nephrographic, and excretory phase). Multidetector CT brings along the risk of increased dose due to thinner slice collimation and overranging phenomena. Indications for CT investigation of the kidney include urolithiasis, tumor diagnosis and staging, renal trauma, and vascular disease. Even in children, special indications for CT of the kidney remain in polytrauma and tumor staging.

CEACAM1 silencing in prostate cancer cell line DU-145 via small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) increased but its overexpression suppressed the expression of angiogenic/lymphangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, -C and -D, and angiogenic inhibitor collagen 18/endostatin. Furthermore, CEACAM1 overexpression in DU-145 cells increased but CEACAM1 silencing reduced angiopoietin-1 expression. Inverse relation was found for angiopoietin-2. Supernatant of CEACAM1-overexpressing DU-145 suppressed but that of CEACAM1-silenced increased the VEGF-induced endothelial tubes. Electron microscopically the majority of PIN-associated blood vessels was structurally destabilized exhibiting endothelial fenestration, trans- and inter-endothelial gaps. In some PIN areas, invasion of single tumor cells into the destabilized blood vessels was observed. These data show that disappearance of epithelial CEACAM1 in PIN is accompanied by its upregulation in adjacent vasculature which apparently correlates with vascular destabilization and increased vascularization of prostate cancer. Strategies to either conserve the epithelial CEACAM1 or to target endothelial CEACAM1 might be useful for an anti-angiogenic therapy of prostate cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2006-03-29", "authors": ["DTilki", "SIrmak", "LOliveira-Ferrer", "JHauschild", "KMiethe", "HAtakaya", "PHammerer", "M GFriedrich", "GSchuch", "RGalalae", "C GStief", "EKilic", "HHuland", "SErgun"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1209514"}

Parathyroid adenomas are the most important cause of primary hyperparathyroidism (80-85%). A case of parathyroid adenoma observed in a patient aged 47, admitted to the Emergency Medicine Department of our Hospital with a diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, cephalea, vomiting, and a clinical history of recurrent episodes of severe abdominal and renal pain, is presented. Lab data showed severe hypercalcemia and a progressive worsening of the renal function. A severe neurological involvement with stupor, derangement of mind, the arising of acute respiratory depression, lethargy compelled the colleagues to transfer him to the Intensive Care Unit; a neck ultrasonography showed a poor-echogenous area under the right thyroid inferior pole, with signs of vascularization. The suspect of a primary hyperparathyroidism related to a single adenoma of the parathyroid gland suggested a surgical treatment. A ''concise parathyroidectomy'' was performed. Our surgical approach was confirmed by the comparison of the preintervention and the post-intervention iPTH values: 2080 pg/mL (normal range: 12-65 pg/mL) before excision vs 101 pg/mL after the removal. The histologycal exam reported a parathyroid adenoma with large areas with haemorrage. Three days after surgery the patient was in good general conditions.

In the light of recent findings, we may have to redefine our thinking of endothelial cells as well as of perivascular mural cells.\nInflammatory hematopoietic cells, such as macrophages, have been shown to promote neoangiogenesis during tumor growth and wound healing. Dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, monocytes, and other immune cells have also been found to be recruited to neoangiogenic niches and to support neovessel formation. These findings have led to the concept that subsets of hematopoietic cells comprise proangiogenic cells that drive adult revascularization processes. While evidence of the importance of endothelial progenitor cells in adult vasculogenesis increased further, the role of these comobilized hematopoietic cells has been intensely studied in the last few years.\nAngiogenic factors promote mobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-positive hematopoietic cells through matrix metalloproteinase-9 mediated release of soluble kit-ligand and recruit these proangiogenic cells to areas of hypoxia, where perivascular mural cells present stromal-derived factor 1 (CXCL-12) as an important retention signal. The same factors are possibly involved in mobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive endothelial precursors that may participate in neovessel formation.

The relationship between the branching coefficient (BC; quotient of the area of the branch and trunk vessels) and the asymmetry index (AI) of the vessel branches was explored. The result was used to formulate a new BC. To test the new BC, a second group of young, healthy individuals also underwent retinal photography.

We also characterized insulin signaling pathways believed to promote myocyte growth and interact with proliferative responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, and we assessed myocardial insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and p110 alpha catalytic and p85 regulatory subunits of phospatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, MEK, ERK1/2, and S6 kinase-1 (S6K1). Left ventricular (LV) geometry and performance were evaluated echocardiographically. Insulin decreased AT1a-R mRNA expression but increased protein levels and increased AT2-R mRNA and protein levels and phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser374/Tyr989), MEK1/2 (Ser218/Ser222), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424/Thr389), Akt (Thr308/Thr308), and PI3K p110 alpha but not of p85 (Tyr508). Insulin increased LV mass and relative wall thickness and reduced stroke volume and cardiac output. Histochemical examination demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy and increases in interstitial fibrosis. Metoprolol plus insulin prevented the increase in relative wall thickness, decreased fibrosis, increased LV mass, and improved function seen with insulin alone.

Angiomyolipoma is a well-known common benign tumor. The occurrence of RCC in association with angiomyolipoma is a rare event, with only approximately 50 cases reported in the nontransplantation setting. In transplant recipients, RCC can develop in native kidneys, but its occurrence \"de novo\" in the renal allograft is very rare with an estimated incidence of less than 0.5%. We report here the case of a 39-year-old woman who underwent cadaveric renal transplantation in 1990. No lesion was observed in the allograft during the pre- and perioperative period or on early postoperative ultrasounds. No graft rejection occurred under a standard triple immunosuppressive therapy. Thirteen years later, during a routine ultrasonography, 2 solid masses were discovered in the allograft, both of them richly vascularized. She underwent allograft nephrectomy and the histologic findings revealed that one of the tumors was a chromophilic (type 1) papillary RCC (2.5 cm in diameter) and the other, an angiomyolipoma (1.5 cm).

Different types of biomaterials are applied for reconstructive indications and receive rising interest. However, autologous bone grafts are still considered as the gold standard for reconstruction of extended bone defects. The generation of bioartificial bone tissues may help to overcome the problems related to donor site morbidity and size limitations. Tissue engineering is, according to its historic definition, an \"interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function\". It is based on the understanding of tissue formation and regeneration and aims to rather grow new functional tissues than to build new spare parts. While reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects using engineered bone tissues is technically feasible, and some of the currently developed concepts may represent alternatives to autologous bone grafts for certain clinical conditions, the reconstruction of large-volume defects remains challenging. Therefore vascularization concepts gain on interest and the combination of tissue engineering approaches with flap prefabrication techniques may eventually allow application of bone-tissue substitutes grown in vivo with the advantage of minimal donor site morbidity as compared to conventional vascularized bone grafts.

Tumor tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically, and microvessel density was evaluated. Clinically, 134 patients with ESCC who underwent esophagectomy were studied. In vitro, CDCA induced the production of PGE2 and VEGF in dose- and time-dependent manners, and these effects were attenuated by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibitor, or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. CDCA-induced COX-2 in the cell lysate increased the secretion of VEGF into the culture medium. In vivo, CDCA markedly enhanced tumor growth and increased vascularization.

Pit1-deficient mice first exhibit pituitary hypoplasia after birth, primarily caused by reduced cell proliferation, although there is some apoptosis. To determine whether altered development of the vascular system contributes to hypopituitarism, we examined vascularization from embryonic d 14.5 and throughout development. No obvious differences in vascularization are evident in developing Pit1-deficient pituitaries. In contrast, the Prop1-deficient mouse pituitaries are poorly vascularized and dysmorphic, with a striking elevation in apoptosis. At postnatal d 11, apoptosis-independent caspase-3 activation occurs in thyrotropes and somatotropes of normal but not mutant pituitaries.

{"title": "Office hysteroscopy and adenomyosis.", "abstract": "Adenomyosis, the heterotopic presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, has traditionally been diagnosed by the pathologist in hysterectomy specimens. However, the recent development of high-quality non-invasive techniques such as transvaginal sonography (TVS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hysteroscopy has renewed interest in diagnosing adenomyosis in the office prior to any treatment. Hysteroscopy offers the advantage of direct visualization of the uterine cavity, and since nowadays it is performed in the office, it can be offered as a first-line diagnostic tool for evaluation of uterine abnormalities in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding and/or infertility. The available data clearly indicate that high-quality mini-hysteroscopes, saline as a distension medium, and atraumatic insertion technique are essential for the success of office hysteroscopy. The procedure is indicated in any situation in which an intrauterine anomaly is suspected; it is immediately preceded by a physical exam and a TVS to evaluate uterine characteristics, and it is followed by a second TVS to take advantage of the intracavitary fluid for a contrast image of the uterus. Although diagnostic hysteroscopy does not provide pathognomonic signs for adenomyosis, some evidence suggests that irregular endometrium with endometrial defects, altered vascularization, and cystic haemorrhagic lesion are possibly associated with the entity. In addition to the direct visualization of the uterine cavity, the hysteroscopic approach offers the possibility of obtaining endometrial/myometrial biopsies under visual control. Since they can be performed in the office, the combination of TVS, fluid hysteroscopy and contrast sonography is therefore a powerful screening tool for detecting endometrial and myometrial abnormalities in association with adenomyosis.", "journal": "Best practice & research.

Here, we summarize recent findings from mouse models of multistage carcinogenesis, which reveal distinct phases of angiogenic activity. Only advanced tumors with a highly heterogeneous, sprouting vasculature recruite endothelial progenitors into neovessels. Surprisingly, during progressive tumor growth endothelial cells acquire new characteristics and secrete CC chemokines, a group of chemoattractants with adjacent cysteins, which play a dual role by enhancing neovascularization in an autocrine and endocrine fashion. Locally, chemokines stimulate endothelial proliferation; systemically, they guide chemokine receptor-positive circulating progenitors into the tumor bed. Subsequently, endothelial progenitors are truly integrated into the network of pre-existing vessels.

{"title": "Hypoxia, HIF and the placenta.", "abstract": "Early in mammalian development the placenta, a highly vascularized organ, develops to facilitate exchange of oxygen (O2), nutrients and waste between mother and offspring. This process is intricately regulated by O2 tension and the hypoxic (low O2) uterine environment. Consequently, the placenta provides an excellent model for understanding the relationship between hypoxia (low O2 tension), organogenesis (organ development)and angiogenesis (blood vessel development). Herein we describe recent research on Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), a heterodimeric transcription factor regulated by hypoxia that is crucial for proper placental development. Complete disruption of HIF signaling through loss of the HIFbeta (ARNT) or HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha subunits results in improper placental development, characterized by a diminished spongiotrophoblast layer and insufficient chorio/allantoic fusion. Experiments using placental stem cells (TS cells) derived from Hif1alpha-/- Hif2alpha-/- (Hifalpha-/-) and Arnt-/- mice indicate that there is increased expression of the labyrinthine specific transcription factors GCM and TFEB and a deficiency in the spongiotrophoblast transcription factor Mash2. Furthermore Hifalpha-/- and Arnt-/- TS cells subjected to differentiating conditions tend to adopt a labyrinthine like syncytial fate, and do not form giant cells or spongiotrophoblasts. These observations demonstrate a crucial role for HIF in the formation of the spongiotrophoblast that is probably regulated by Mash2, and suggest a complex interaction between hypoxia, HIF and Mash2 in the formation of the spongiotrophoblast.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2006-03-23", "authors": ["Benjamin HFryer", "M CelesteSimon"], "doi": "10.4161/cc.5.5.2497"}

The chemotactic response of ECs to the VEGF-producing cells was explored in two in vitro systems, the modified Boyden chamber assay and a 2-D fence-style migration assay, and both demonstrated increased migration of ECs in response to VEGF-transfected cells. Furthermore, endothelial cells seeded on top of the VEGF-transfected SMCs formed capillary-like structures. These results suggest that VSMCs genetically modified to produce VEGF could be a potential delivery mechanism to enhance endothelial cell migration and subsequent capillary formation, which in turn could improve vascularization of ischemic or regenerating tissue. Furthermore, this system could potentially be used as an in vitro test bed for evaluation of novel angiogenic and anti-angiogenic compounds.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2006-03-22", "authors": ["Wafa MElbjeirami", "Jennifer LWest"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.12.381"}
{"title": "Delivery of hepatotrophic factors fails to enhance longer-term survival of subcutaneously transplanted hepatocytes.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering approaches have been investigated as a strategy for hepatocyte transplantation; however the death of a majority of transplanted cells critically limits success of these approaches. In a previous study, a transient increase in hepatocyte survival was achieved through delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from the porous polymer scaffold utilized for cell delivery. To enhance longer-term survival of the hepatocytes, this delivery system was modified to additionally deliver epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a sustained manner. Hepatocytes were subcutaneously implanted in SCID mice on scaffolds containing EGF and/or HGF, in addition to VEGF, and survival was monitored for two weeks. A short-term enhancement of hepatocyte survival was observed after one week and is attributed to VEGF-enhanced vascularization, which was not altered by EGF or HGF. Surprisingly, long-term hepatocyte engraftment was not improved, as survival declined to the level of control conditions for all growth factor combinations after two weeks. This investigation indicates that the survival of hepatocytes transplanted into heterotopic locations is dependent on multiple signals. The delivery system developed for the current study may be useful in elucidating the specific factors controlling this process, and bring therapeutic transplantation of hepatocytes closer to implementation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2006-03-22", "authors": ["Molly KSmith", "Kathryn WRiddle", "David JMooney"], "doi": "10.1089/ten.2006.12.235"}

{"title": "Clinical interest of digestive arterial trunk anastomoses.", "abstract": "Arterial vascularization of the gastrointestinal tract is a three-level system composed of the coeliac trunk, and both superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The three levels are joined together via arterial trunk anastomoses such as the so-called and well-known Riolan arcade or supramarginal arcade. The aim of this study was to review the embryology of the digestive arteries in order to understand the anatomic variations, the development of the arterial trunk anastomoses and the potential collateral circulation in the case of obstruction of one or several arterial trunks. The arch theory by Mac Kay and Tandler longitudinal arterial anastomosis account for the genesis of the arterial trunk anastomoses and the main anatomic variations. The coeliac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery are joined together via the pancreaticoduodenal arcades and the B\u00fchler arcade. These anastomoses are divided during pancreatic resections but developed in the case of coeliac trunk stenosis. The mesenteric arteries are joined together by the Riolan, Villemin arcades and by the marginal artery of Drummond. This collateral circulation and the Riolan arcade in particular, is utilized during left colonic resection. In the case of this collateral circulation insufficiency, inferior mesenteric artery reimplantation is necessary during abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Arteriopathy, more and more frequent due to population ageing is responsible for frequent obliteration of one or several digestive arterial trunks with subsequent development of collateral circulation. For such reasons, a sound knowledge of digestive arterial anatomy is an absolute prerequisite for surgical practice.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2006-03-21", "authors": ["RichardDouard", "Jean-MarcChevallier", "VincentDelmas", "Paul-HenriCugnenc"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-006-0098-8"}

The current study demonstrates that a population of intermediate-stage precursors, which possesses primitive endothelial properties during hESC differentiation, is capable of giving rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Single cell analysis reveals that these primitive endothelial-like precursors contain rare bipotent cells with hemangioblast properties, responsible for both endothelial and hematopoietic cell fates.

To simulate microvascular responses to blood flow, the following three types of responses to wall shear stress were considered; non-reactive (solid-like), cerebral arteriole, and skeletal muscle arteriole-like responses. The numerical calculation was carried out in the condition where a feeding arteriole was occlused. Flow changes in efferent vessels were evaluated for assessment of blood supply to the local area of cerebral tissue. The present simulation has demonstrated that blood flow in efferent vessels was influenced by the topology of the vascular network and the response pattern in single vessels.

Results revealed that the degradation rate increased in the order of PHB < PHBHHx < PLA. During the implantation period, crystallinity of PHBHHx increased from 19% to 22% and then dropped to 14%. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) displayed increasing polydispersity and typical bimodal distribution from 3 to 6 months. The above results suggested that rapid PHBHHx degradation occurred in amorphous region rather than in crystalline region. While the in vivo hydrolysis of PHB was found to start from a random chain scission both in amorphous and crystalline regions of the polymer matrix, as demonstrated by its hydrolysis process accompanied by a decrease in molecular weight with unimodal distribution and relatively narrow polydispersity. Compared to pure PHBHHx, PHBHHx-PEG blends showed accelerated weight loss of PHBHHx with weak molecular weight reduction. In general, PHBHHx elicited a very mild tissue response during implantation lasting 6 months compared with relative acute immunological reactions observed among PHB and PLA objects, respectively.

Among chemokines, Regulated on Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) CC chemokine ligand (CCL5) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (CCL2) are upregulated in rejecting cardiac allografts. To antagonize these chemokines, we constructed adenoviral vectors expressing NH(2)-terminal deletion (8ND) mutants of the respective genes. Using the F344-to-LEW rat model, intragraft gene transfer of chemokine analogs prolonged cardiac allograft survival from 10.1+/-0.7 and 10.4+/-0.7 days using non-coding adenovirus and vehicle alone, respectively, to 17.0+/-0.7 days for 8ND-RANTES (P<0.001) and 14.2+/-0.8 days for 8ND-MCP-1 (P<0.01). 8ND-RANTES reduced graft infiltration by monocytes/macrophages, cluster of differentiation (CD) 8alpha(+) and T-cell receptor alphabeta(+) cells, while 8ND-MCP-1 reduced monocytes/macrophages. In mixed leukocyte reactions in vitro, proliferation of host lymphocytes from regional lymph nodes in response to donor splenocytes was unaffected by 8ND-RANTES gene transfer. Using a two-gene approach, the contribution of 8ND-MCP-1 was negligible, consistent with available evidence that 8ND-RANTES inhibits both RANTES and MCP-1 activities. 8ND-RANTES gene transfer and a short course of low-dose cyclosporine A synergistically prolonged graft survival to 37.8+/-5.5 vs 15.4+/-0.5 days with cyclosporine alone (P<0.001).

CD8+ and CD8 T cells were collected following graft rejection and adoptively transferred to SCID mice, which were then challenged with BALB/c corneal allografts. In every case, CD8 T cells could mediate graft rejection when adoptively transferred to SCID mice that received BALB/c corneal allografts. Although CD8+ T cells also mediated graft rejection, the tempo was slower. Moreover, CD8+ T cells collected FasL-defective donors that had rejected corneal allografts, mediated corneal allograft rejection in only 50% of the SCID mice that received the adoptively transferred cells. In some cases, CD8+ T-cell-mediated rejection occurred in the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, but was associated with CD8+ T-cell-mediated apoptosis of BALB/c corneal cells in vitro.

High vascularization and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy are two well-established features of phaeochromocytomas (PCCs).

This study therefore evaluated whether inactivation of PTEN may be involved in the tumourigenesis of PCC in man and whether PTEN abnormalities may help to define the malignant potential of these tumours. Tumour and germline DNA was analysed from 31 patients with apparently sporadic PCC, including 14 clinically benign and 17 malignant tumours, for loss of the PTEN gene locus, mutations in the PTEN gene, and for PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis showed loss of PTEN in four malignant tumours (40%) and in one benign tumour (14%). However, no mutations of PTEN were observed.

PMMTI occurred in 6 infants, 3 of whom had a congenital presentation of a soft tissue mass. All patients were otherwise healthy. The tumors occurred on the trunk, extremities, and head and neck. Grossly, the tumors were nonencapsulated and had a multinodular appearance with focal infiltrative growth, a white fleshy cut surface, and a tumor diameter ranging from 2 to 15 cm. Histologically, a diffuse growth of primitive spindle, polygonal, and round cells occurred in a myxoid background. The tumor cells were arranged in a vaguely nodular pattern with peripheral collagenized stroma, higher cellularity at the periphery, and a delicate vascular network in the background. Immunohistochemically, the tumors displayed diffuse reactivity for vimentin and no reactivity for smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, desmin, S-100 protein, or myogenin.

Here, we re-evaluate the clinical anatomy of the region to challenge the view that the ITB moves antero-posteriorly over the epicondyle. Gross anatomical and microscopical studies were conducted on the distal portion of the ITB in 15 cadavers. This was complemented by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of six asymptomatic volunteers and studies of two athletes with acute ITB syndrome. In all cadavers, the ITB was anchored to the distal femur by fibrous strands, associated with a layer of richly innervated and vascularized fat. In no cadaver, volunteer or patient was a bursa seen. The MR scans showed that the ITB was compressed against the epicondyle at 30 degrees of knee flexion as a consequence of tibial internal rotation, but moved laterally in extension. MR signal changes in the patients with ITB syndrome were present in the region occupied by fat, deep to the ITB. The ITB is prevented from rolling over the epicondyle by its femoral anchorage and because it is a part of the fascia lata. We suggest that it creates the illusion of movement, because of changing tension in its anterior and posterior fibres during knee flexion. Thus, on anatomical grounds, ITB overuse injuries may be more likely to be associated with fat compression beneath the tract, rather than with repetitive friction as the knee flexes and extends.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2006-03-15", "authors": ["JohnFairclough", "KojiHayashi", "HechmiToumi", "KathleenLyons", "GraemeBydder", "NicolaPhillips", "Thomas MBest", "MikeBenjamin"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00531.x"}

This study determines the presence of osteoblasts (cola(1)(I) mRNA), osteoclasts (TRAP), and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs; GrA mRNA) within pretreated bone grafts 12 days after transplantation. The grafts were transplanted either as isografts, allografts, or allografts in presensitized recipients. In fresh isografts, serving as control, well-formed blood vessels and the highest numbers of viable osteoblasts and osteoclasts were found. In fresh allografts, blood vessels were observed within the marrow cavity and the bone was partially covered by osteoblasts and osteoclasts accompanied by CTLs. In DMSO-pretreated frozen allografts, blood vessels together with osteoblasts were observed in three of five, but in none of five grafts frozen without DMSO. However, infiltration with CTLs was higher in DMSO-pretreated frozen allografts when compared to grafts frozen without DMSO. In presensitized allograft recipients, independent of the pretreatment, in none of the grafts were either blood vessels or osteoblasts found. Thus, fast cryopreservation of bone using DMSO improves vascularization and expression of cola(1)(I) mRNA (osteoblasts) after allografting when compared to cryopreservation alone, potentially improving graft incorporation. As these grafts were still invaded by CTLs, the long-term effect of DMSO pretreatment needs to be defined.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2006-03-15", "authors": ["R JEgli", "CWingenfeld", "MH\u00f6lzle", "AHempfing", "C RFraitzl", "RGanz", "MLeunig"], "doi": "10.1080/08941930600569050"}
{"title": "Prolactin and breast cancer risk.", "abstract": "Prolactin, a hormone involved in normal breast development and lactation, has been hypothesized to be important in the etiology of breast cancer. This review summarizes in vitro, animal, and epidemiologic data supporting this hypothesis. Experimental evidence indicates that prolactin can promote cell proliferation and survival, increase cell motility, and support tumor vascularization. Animal data suggest that prolactin can increase tumor growth rates and the number of metastases, as well as induce both estrogen receptor +(ER) and ER--tumors in a transgenic mouse model in which ER+ tumors are very rare. Epidemiologic data for premenopausal women are sparse; however a recent study with 235 cases reported a significant positive association between plasma prolactin levels and breast cancer risk. Studies in postmenopausal women have reported a positive association as well, and in the largest study (n=851 cases) the association was strongest for ER+ tumors. Overall, the available data support the hypothesis that prolactin increases risk of breast cancer. Future research directions include better characterizing the potential interplay between prolactin and estrogen and determining whether genetic variability in prolactin-related genes is associated with breast cancer risk.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2006-03-15", "authors": ["Shelley STworoger", "Susan EHankinson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.032"}

A standardized examination technique and predefined definitions of ultrasound characteristics were used. On the basis of subjective evaluation of ultrasound findings, the examiner classified each mass as being certainly benign, probably benign, unclassifiable, probably malignant or certainly malignant. Even when the examiner found the mass unclassifiable (i.e. difficult mass) he or she was obliged to state whether the mass was more likely to be benign or malignant. Borderline tumors were classified as malignant.\nThere were 90 (8%) unclassifiable masses. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed papillary projections, >10 locules in a cyst without solid components, low-level echogenicity of cyst fluid, and moderate vascularization as assessed subjectively at color Doppler examination to be ultrasound variables independently associated with unclassifiable mass. Borderline malignant tumors (n = 55) proved to be most difficult to assess with only 47% being correctly classified (i.e. classified as malignant), 29% being incorrectly classified (i.e. classified as benign) and 24% being unclassifiable vs. 90% of non-borderline tumors being correctly classified, 3% being incorrectly classified and 8% being unclassifiable (P < 0.0001). Papillary cystadeno(fibro)mas, myomas and cases of struma ovarii were also more common among the unclassifiable masses than among the classifiable ones (5.6% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.008; 4.4% vs. 0.9%, P = 0.02; 4.4% vs. 0.2%, P = 0.0006). No ultrasound variable or clinical variable (including CA 125) entered a logistic regression model to predict malignancy in difficult masses. A model could be constructed for difficult masses containing papillary projections but this model performed no better than subjective evaluation of the ultrasound image. Sensitivity and specificity of subjective evaluation with regard to malignancy in the group of unclassifiable masses were 56% (14/25) and 77% (50/65) vs. 91% (220/241) and 97% (712/735) in the classifiable masses.\nBorderline tumors cause great diagnostic difficulties, but so do papillary cystadeno(fibro)mas, struma ovarii and some myomas.

The main perforators were strategically located in the flap center to keep the peripheral area within the vascular territory. The flaps were larger than needed, initially elevated subfascially, and then thinned to the suitable thickness while the pedicle was still attached. The dissection of perforators in the adipose layer close to the dermis entry was carried out microscopically. Flap sizes ranged from 3 x 3 to 16 x 8 cm.\nSeventeen flaps survived completely and one had distal superficial necrosis of 1 x 2 cm. No debulking procedures were necessary.

Surgical treatment includes the use of local, reverse flow, and free flaps. The authors describe a new reverse homodigital flap to repair distal defects of the thumb. This flap is raised from the dorsal radial side of the first metacarpal area. It is pedicled on the dorsal radial collateral artery, which is constant for course, caliber, and communication with the palmar circuit.\nThe flap is raised by means of distal to proximal dissection, the skin island is incised at the periphery, and the subcutaneous pedicle is separated from superficial and deep tissues, leaving a certain quantity of loose tissue to protect the vascular axis. The digital sensory radial nerve is enclosed in the pedicle. The dissection must stop near the middle point of the proximal phalanx, which constitutes the pivot point of the flap. The flap is distally transposed and sutured on the deficit site.\nThe homodigital dorsal radial flap was used on 16 patients to repair distal losses of substance of the thumb. The final results were good for reliability and coverage and from the aesthetic point of view for both the reconstructed area and the donor site. In pulp reconstruction, there was a good recovery of sensitivity, without a neural anastomosis being performed (the mean value of static two-point discrimination was 9 cm in this series).\nWider use of this flap has helped to improve knowledge of dorsal vascularization of the thumb and to give another option for the repair of distal losses of substance of the thumb.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2006-03-10", "authors": ["FrancescoMoschella", "AdrianaCordova"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000200665.73624.6d"}

The authors' aim in the present study was to determine whether skin graft vascularization occurs by (1) simple reconnection of vessels, (2) ingrowth of recipient vasculature, (3) outgrowth of donor-derived vessels, and/or (4) recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells.\nFull-thickness skin grafts (1 x 1 cm) were transferred between wild-type FVB/N mice (n = 20) and transgenic tie2/lacZ mice (n = 20), where lacZ expression is controlled by the endothelial specific tie2 promoter, allowing differentiation of recipient and donor endothelial cells. The contribution of endothelial progenitor cells to skin graft neovascularization was determined using a bone marrow transplant model where tie2/lacZ bone marrow was transplanted into wild-type mice (n = 20).\nVascular regression in the graft was observed at the periphery starting on day 3 and moving centrally through day 21, sparing graft vessels in the absolute center of the graft. At the same time, vascular ingrowth occurred from the wound bed to replace the regressing vessels. Furthermore, bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells contributed to these new vessels starting as early as day 7. Surprisingly, the contribution of bone marrow-derived vessels to the overall process was approximately 15 to 20 percent of new endothelial cells.\nReplacement of the donor graft vasculature by endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells from the recipient along preexisting channels is the predominant mechanism for skin graft revascularization. This mechanism is likely similar for all nonvascularized free grafts and suggests novel strategies for optimizing the vascularization of tissue constructs engineered in vitro.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2006-03-10", "authors": ["Jennifer MCapla", "Daniel JCeradini", "Oren MTepper", "Matthew JCallaghan", "Kirit ABhatt", "Robert DGaliano", "Jamie PLevine", "Geoffrey CGurtner"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000201459.91559.7f"}

The treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine has only modest activity with a small survival benefit, and toxicity continues to be a major obstacle. New therapeutic strategies that notably lack cross resistance with established treatment regimens are much needed in pancreatic cancer. One such approach is the pharmacological control of angiogenesis that represents a novel approach to the management of pancreas cancer, since the pathological development of vascular supply is a critical step for tumor growth and may affect its prognosis. Since pancreatic carcinoma show strong tumor neoangiogenesis, overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key mediator of angiogenesis, in pancreatic cancer and consequently are highly vascularized, the role of anti-angiogenic therapies is under exploration at present. Hence, this review covers the summary of the development of anti-angiogenesis as anti-antitumor therapy in pancreatic carcinoma, including matrix-metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs), such as marimastat and BAY 12-9566, anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA), celecoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor), thalidomide and others.

This zone has been identified to be localized between smooth muscle and adventitial layer of human adult vascular wall. It predominantly contains CD34-positive (+) but CD31-negative (-) cells, which also express VEGFR2 and TIE2. Only few cells in this zone of the vascular wall are positive for CD45. In a ring assay using the fragments of human internal thoracic artery (HITA), we show here that the CD34+ cells of the HITA-wall form capillary sprouts ex vivo and are apparently recruited for capillary formation by tumor cells. New vessels formed by these vascular wall resident EPCs express markers for angiogenically activated endothelial cells, such as CEACAM1, and also for mature endothelial cells, such as VE-cadherin or occludin. Vascular wall areas containing EPCs are found in large and middle sized arteries and veins of all organs studied here.

Endoglin has been associated with angiogenesis and prognosis in several malignancies. Although microvascular structure has been characterized by a variety of different other endothelial markers so far, there is no consensus on the prognostic value of microvessel quantification in uveal melanoma due to differences in tissue pretreatment, variability in the reactivity of endothelial cell markers, blood vessel counting methods, and vasculogenic mimicry by melanoma cells expressing endothelial cell markers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of endoglin and to evaluate whether proliferative activity of ECs determines the clinical prognosis of uveal melanoma.\nParaffin sections from 35 clinicopathologically well-characterized cases of primary uveal melanomas were stained for Ki-67, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and endoglin. In 16 cases, metastatic disease led to death. The mean follow-up of the nonmetastasized cases was 10.6 (9-13) years. The immunohistological specimens were evaluated by three independent observers who were masked to the follow-up of patients. Statistical analyzes included Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the fitting of log-rank and Wilcoxon test models.\nImmunohistochemistry with vWF confirmed that all examined specimens were vascularized. Expression of Ki-67 could be found in 26 (74%) of the samples. Moderate to high expression of endoglin was found in 13 cases (37%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association (p<0.001) between an enhanced endoglin expression and death due to metastatic uveal melanoma.\nThe study demonstrates for the first time that the expression of endoglin can be used as a specific marker for angiogenesis in uveal melanomas. Thus, differentiation between the quiescent and proliferating ECs enables the location and characterization of hot spots of angiogenesis in melanomas.

Rarely, arthrodesis is done to stabilize the glenohumeral joint after many failed attempts at shoulder reconstruction. Arthrodesis for failed prosthetic arthroplasty or tumor resection presents additional challenges because of the associated bone loss on the humeral and/or glenoid side of the joint. Primary arthrodesis requires rigid internal plate fixation and both an extra- and an intra-articular site of fusion. Depending on bone volume and quality needed, the patient may require bracing for 8 to 10 weeks, autogenous or allograft bone grafting, or a vascularized fibular bone graft to reconstruct the bone deficiency, along with prolonged spica cast immobilization.

Standard therapies fail in 31% of cases, and lower extremity amputation and loss of independent functional status are common. Innovative therapies are desperately needed, particularly in diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease at high risk for bad outcomes. Angiogenic gene therapy is a novel, logical and promising approach in these patients. Adult bone is not well vascularized. Host inflammation and bacterial toxin production result in further loss of vascularity, and produce bone necrosis. Dead bone acts as a foreign body, and is permissive for persistent infection. Poor blood supply prevents remodeling of dead bone, delivery of antibiotics, and phagocytosis of bacteria. Therefore, angiogenic gene therapy may be a useful therapeutic agent in osteomyelitis. It is reasonable to pursue studies of angiogenic agents in established animal models of chronic osteomyelitis, not only with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but also with the powerful bone angiogenic agent, placental growth factor, as well as other agents with tissue regenerative and angiogenic potential, such as sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic proteins, matrix metalloproteinase-9, secretoneurin, and perhaps pluripotent stem cells.

The union rate (after imaging evaluation including magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional outcome of using vascularized bone grafts pedicled on the palmar carpal epiphyseal artery for waist nonunions of the scaphoid are reported in this prospective case series.\nThe technique was applied to 9 waist nonunions resulting from fractures. The mean time elapsed from the initial injury to the procedure was 22 months and the mean follow-up time was 24 months. The graft was pedicled on the artery running at the distal edge of the pronator quadratus and was inserted in the nonunion as an intercalary graft. Six patients had postoperative MRIs to evaluate fracture healing and graft incorporation.\nUnion was accomplished in all cases between 6 and 12 weeks. Postoperative MRI showed the viability of the graft (contrast-enhanced images) and confirmed union and graft incorporation. Complete absence of pain was noted in all patients. The Mayo modified wrist score increased from 63 to 92 after surgery and according to this score results were excellent in 5 patients and good in 4.\nVascularized bone grafts from the anterior radius lead to rapid union and consolidation in cases of waist nonunion. Postoperative MRI confirms viability of the graft, union, and graft incorporation. The approach is limited to the distal radius and wrist and lacks donor site morbidity.

This neoangiogenesis provides sufficient nourishment of the tumor when it exceeds a certain size. Recently, a similar mechanism has been postulated for the development of new lymph vessels in tumors, termed lymphangiogenesis. Thus, tumors get access to the circulation and lymph drainage like any other growing or regenerating tissue. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis support metastasis development. Elaborating on this model, we herein present strong arguments for the new theory that tumors initiate their own innervation by the release of neurotrophic factors in analogy to lymphangiogenesis and neoangiogenesis. For this process, we coin the term neoneurogenesis. It is likely that neoneurogenesis further supports the formation of metastases, since the ingrown nerve endings can release neurotransmitters which enhance the metastasis development. Strikingly, the presence of nerve cell markers in tumor tissues has been shown to be a prognostic marker for the course of a cancer disease, and we have recently reported on the metastasis-increasing function of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in a mouse model.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2006-03-07", "authors": ["FrankEntschladen", "DanielPalm", "KerstinLang", "Theodore LDrell", "Kurt SZaenker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.015"}
{"title": "Do dogs harbour risk factors for human breast cancer?", "abstract": "We ask consulting patients regularly whether they keep pets in order to identify zoonotic factors. It became apparent that patients with breast carcinoma (N=69) owned significantly more often dogs but not cats compared to age matched female controls. We compared the frequencies of dog and pet ownership with data from public available statistics on women (N=1320) of the same age group in Bavaria. The most striking result was that more than twice the number of patients kept dogs permanently in the last 10 years and at the time of interrogation as compared to control individuals at the time of interrogation (p=0.0000003, relative risk 3.5). Further internet search on the morbidity of breast carcinoma showed in dogs a protracted course of disease and metastases into lung, liver and bones, resembling the course of disease in human breast cancer. In contrast with this, breast cancer presented in cats a dramatically short course and the main but unusual location of metastasis presents in the hind legs. A recent publication in Norway reported on a high frequency (53.3%) of breast carcinomas in 14,401 investigated dogs. Which transmissible factor or factors come into question? Variants of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) can productively replicate in human cells and in different animals, including dogs. Many investigators, but not all, could identify MMTV-like sequences in sporadic human breast cancer. MMTV or MMTV-like sequences have not been investigated in canine breast carcinomas until now. It is also conceivable that other microbes from the dog, for example bacteria, could participate in the first steps of carcinogenesis in human. It was recently shown that bartonella species promote vascularization and prevent apoptosis of infected cells with the same methods as helicobacter pylori. Our considerations require further research.

The loss of these guidance mechanisms can lead to abnormal vascularization and a number of pathological conditions. The molecular basis of endothelial cell guidance and subsequent tissue specific vascular patterning remains largely unknown in spite of its clinical relevance and biological importance. In this regard, retinal vascular development offers many advantages for studying endothelial cell guidance and the mechanisms by which characteristic vascular patterns are formed. In this review, we will provide an overview of the known mechanisms that mediate vascular patterning during mouse retinal development, synthesizing these data to formulate a model of how growth factors, cellular adhesion molecules, and vascular-associated cells mediate directed endothelial cell migration and appropriate vascular remodeling.

In bone, they are associated with cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix (ECM).

The HS-degrading endoglycosidase, heparanase, has been implicated in processes such as inflammation, vascularization associated with wound healing and malignancies, and cancer metastasis. Here we show progressive mRNA expression of the hpa gene (encoding heparanase) in murine bone marrow stromal cells undergoing osteoblastic (bone forming) differentiation and in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Bone marrow stromal cells derived from transgenic mice expressing recombinant human heparanase (rh-heparanase) and MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells exposed to soluble rh-heparanase spontaneously undergo osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the transgenic bone marrow stromal cells degrade HS chains. In wild-type (WT) and hpa-transgenic (hpa-tg) mice, heparanase is weakly expressed throughout the bone marrow with a substantial increase in osteoblasts and osteocytes, especially in the hpa-tg mice. Heparanase expression was absent in osteoclasts. Micro-computed tomographic and histomorphometric skeletal analyses in male and female hpa-tg versus WT mice show markedly increased trabecular bone mass, cortical thickness, and bone formation rate, but no difference in osteoclast number.

The present study tested the hypothesis that sodium N-6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphate (DBcAMP), which has been shown to accelerate wound healing, promotes recruitment of EPC into wounds and contributes to the stimulation of neovascularization in genetically diabetic mice. Topical application of DBcAMP resulted in significant acceleration of wound healing and wound vascularization partly via enhanced recruitment of EPC. EPC in DBcAMP-treated wounds were mainly localized to cell clusters at the border of the granulation tissue, a site where blood supply is most insufficient. DBcAMP treatment increased the mRNA expression of angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) in vivo in wound tissue and in cultured fibroblasts and macrophages, in vitro.

The fish excavates burrows in mudflats but, unlike the sympatric amphibious mudskippers, it does not emerge but stays in the burrows filled with hypoxic water during low tide. Endoscopic observations of the field burrows demonstrated that the fish breathed air in the burrow opening; air breathing commenced 1.3 h following burrow emersion, when water P(O2) was approximately 2.8 kPa, with an air-breathing frequency (f(AB)) of 7.3+/-2.9 breaths h(-1) (mean +/- s.d., N=5). Laboratory experiments revealed that the fish is a facultative air breather. It never breathed air in normoxic water (P(O2)=20.7 kPa) but started bimodal respiration when water P(O2) was reduced to 1.0-3.1 kPa. The fish held air inside the mouth and probably used the gills as gas-exchange surfaces since no rich vascularization occurred in the mouth linings. As is known for other air-breathing fishes, f(AB) increased with decreasing water P(O2). Both buccal gas volume (V(B)) and inspired volume (V(I)) were significantly correlated with body mass (M(b)). At a given M(b), V(I) was nearly always equal to V(B), implying almost complete buccal gas renewal in every breathing cycle. A temporal reduction in expired volume (V(E)) was probably due to a low aerial gas exchange ratio (CO2) elimination/O2 uptake). Air breathing appears to have evolved in O. lacepedii as an adaptation to aquatic hypoxia in the burrows. The acquisition of the novel respiratory capacity enables this species to stay in the burrows during low tide and extends the resident time in the mudflat, thereby increasing its chances of tapping the rich resources of the area.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2006-03-04", "authors": ["Tomas TGonzales", "MasayaKatoh", "AtsushiIshimatsu"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.02092"}

Thus, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is emerging as a promising target in the treatment of malignancies. Human angiostatin (hANG) is one of the most potent inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in vivo. However, its mechanisms operating in vivo are not well understood.\nTo obtain more information about functional changes in the angiogenic process, we established Morris hepatoma (MH3924A) cell lines expressing hANG (hANG-MH3924A). The effects of hANG expression on proliferation and apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were measured in coculture experiments in vitro. To evaluate changes in tumor perfusion and blood volume, H2 15O and 68Ga-DOTA-albumin (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid) were used for PET studies in vivo. Additionally, immunohistologic quantification of vascularization, apoptosis, and proliferation as well as gene array analyses were performed.\nOur in vitro experiments demonstrate reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in HUVECs when being cocultured with hANG-MH3924A. In support, tumor growth of hANG-MH3924A is diminished by 95% in vivo. However, tumor perfusion and blood volume are increased in hANG-MH3924A corresponding to an increased microvessel density. Furthermore, hANG-transfected tumors show changes in expression of genes related to apoptosis, stress, signal transduction, and metabolism.\nhANG expression leads to inhibition of tumor growth, increased apoptosis, and changes in the expression of multiple genes involved in stress reactions, signal transduction, and apoptosis, which indicates a multifactorial reaction of tumors.

{"title": "Biomimetic design of microfluidic manifolds based on a generalised Murray's law.", "abstract": "The relationship governing the optimum ratio between the diameters of the parent and daughter branches in vascular systems was first discovered by Murray using the principle of minimum work. This relationship is now known as Murray's law and states that the cube of the diameter of the parent vessel must equal the sum of the cubes of the daughter vessels. For symmetric bifurcations, an important consequence of this geometric rule is that the tangential shear stress at the wall remains constant throughout the vascular network. In the present paper, we extend this important hydrodynamic concept to arbitrary cross-sections and provide a framework for constructing a simple but elegant biomimetic design rule for hierarchical microfluidic networks. The paper focuses specifically on constant-depth rectangular and trapezoidal channels often employed in lab-on-a-chip systems. To validate our biomimetic design rule and demonstrate the application of Murray's law to microfluidic manifolds, a comprehensive series of computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed.

Induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) has been shown to play an important role in promoting tumor metastases to lymph nodes. Here, we employed receptor-specific antagonist antibodies in an orthotopic spontaneous breast cancer metastasis model to provide direct evidence for the key role of VEGFR-3 activation in metastasis. Inhibition of VEGFR-3 activation more potently suppressed regional and distant metastases than inactivation of VEGFR-2, although VEGFR-2 blockade was more effective in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth. Despite prominent proliferation, metastases were not vascularized in any of the control and treatment groups, indicating that the growth of metastases was not dependent on angiogenesis at the secondary site for the duration of the experiment. Systemic treatment with either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 antagonistic antibodies suppressed tumor lymphangiogenesis, indicating that VEGFR-3 signaling affects the rate of tumor cell entry into lymphatic vessels through both lymphangiogenesis-dependent and independent mechanisms. Combination treatment with the anti-VEGFR-2 and anti-VEGFR-3 antibodies more potently decreased lymph node and lung metastases than each antibody alone.

In 19 cases these were uncomplicated cysts, and in 3 cases these were complicated cysts. 35/43 lesions were histologically proven solid vascularized tumors (29 renal cell carcinomas, 6 urothelial carcinomas), five additional masses with tumor signs in MRI appeared to be progressive during follow-up thus suggesting malignancy, and one case was a multifocal bilateral renal tumor. 3/43 lesions were initially reported as being suspected of malignancy but were proven during follow-up or histologically to be benign. Tumor thrombus was depicted in MRI in the renal vein in 5 cases, stretching into the IVC in 4 cases and proven histologically in 4 and 3 cases, respectively. Of these solid masses, 99 cystic lesions could be differentiated clearly in MRI (88 simple cysts, 11 complicated cysts) that remained unchanged during follow-up (6 - 65 months) or were proven to be cysts histologically. In 17 cases these cysts were bilateral, in 19 cases unilateral, and 33 kidneys showed multicystic changes. In characterizing renal masses, MRI showed a positive predictive value of 93 % for the diagnosis of a malignant tumor. The T-stage of histologically proven renal cell carcinomas using MRI was correct in 89 %.\nMRI is a valid modality for characterizing and staging renal masses using a suitable sequence protocol that includes dynamic ce studies. Venous tumor invasion can be depicted safely.

Recently, the popularity of spinal fusion leads to more opportunities to obtain disc specimens, which could be applied to explore the pathogenesis of disc degeneration with modern biologic techniques.\nThere were 21 specimens of lumbar intervertebral discs from 15 patients with discogenic low back pain during posterior lumbar interbody fusion, 16 aging discs from patients without low back pain, and 10 normal discs as control collected for the study of their histopathologic features, as well as the expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and its receptor (Flg), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its receptor (TGF-betaRI) by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of macrophages and mast cells was also noted. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was assessed to evaluate proliferating activities of disc cells.\nThe distinct histologic characteristic of the disc from the patient with discogenic low back pain was the ingrowth of vascularized granulation tissue along torn fissures, extending from the external layer of the anulus fibrosus into the nucleus pulposus. The immunohistochemical staining showed that there were strong expressions of bFGF and TGF-beta1 and their receptors, as well as a strong expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the zones of granulation tissue in the painful discs. However, there were only weak expressions in the nongranulation tissue zones in the painful discs and aging discs, and no expression in the control discs. In addition, abundant macrophages and mast cells were found in the granulation tissue zones of painful discs but absent in the nongranulation tissue zones of painful discs or aging discs and the normal control discs.\nThe findings indicated that degeneration of the painful disc might originate from the injury and subsequent repair of anulus fibrosus.

This is important in clarifying the diverse variables influencing the ultimate outcome of the solid organ and composite tissue transplants. To establish bone marrow transplantation as a routine clinical application, further experimental studies should be conducted to overcome the obstacles related to the bone marrow transplantation. These obstacles include graft versus host disease, immunocompetence, and toxicity of the conditioning regimens. For these purposes, novel experimental models are needed. In an attempt to provide a reliable research tool for bone marrow-based tolerance induction studies, we introduced different experimental models of modified vascularized skin/bone marrow (VSBM) transplantation technique for tolerance induction, monitoring, and maintenance studies. In this skin/bone transplantation model, the technical feasibility of concurrent or consecutive transplantation of the combination of bilateral vascularized skin, vascularized bone marrow, or vascularized skin/bone marrow transplants was investigated. Isograft transplantations were performed between genetically identical Lewis (LEW, RT1) rats. Five different experimental designs in 5 groups of 5 animals each were studied. Group I: Bilateral vascularized skin (VS) transplantation; group II: bilateral vascularized skin/bone transplantation; group III: vascularized skin transplantation on one side and vascularized skin/bone transplantation on the contralateral side; group IV: vascularized bone transplantation on one side and vascularized skin/bone transplantation on the contralateral side; group V: vascularized bone transplantation on one side and vascularized skin transplantation on the contralateral side. Successful transplantations were performed in all groups. The survival of the isograft transplants was evaluated clinically and histologically. All skin flaps remained pink and pliable and grew new hair. The viability of the compact bone, bone marrow and skin at 100 days posttransplant was confirmed by histologic evaluation, and bone marrow revealed active hematopoiesis. Bilateral skin/bone transplantation model may serve as an experimental tool to study new strategies in tolerance induction by altering the amount of the immunogenic load in the form of skin transplant and bone marrow delivery in the vascularized form, allowing for expedited engraftment of stem and progenitor cells.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2006-03-02", "authors": ["SelahattinOzmen", "Betul GUlusal", "Ali EUlusal", "DariuszIzycki", "MariaSiemionow"], "doi": "10.1097/01.sap.0000199154.85697.13"}

Surgical margin, incidence of recurrence and metastasis, patient survival, time to bone union, and postoperative function were evaluated. Limb-salvage surgery resulted in wide excisions in two patients with giant-cell tumors of bone and chordoma, respectively, a marginal excision in one patient with a schwannoma, and intralesional excisions to preserve nerve roots in two patients with giant-cell tumors. There was no recurrence at final followup in any of the patients. Bone union required an average of 5.4 months. The postoperative functional results were excellent in all patients except for the patient with a chordoma. In one of the patients with a giant-cell tumor, the screws and rod were removed partially because of skin necrosis in the instrumentation area.

All measurements were performed under light-adapted conditions, with the animals spontaneously inspiring room air. The oxygen distribution in the avascular portion of the outer retina was analyzed by an established three-layer mathematical model that determines outer retinal oxygen consumption.\nThe intraretinal oxygen distribution in the inner retina in individual profiles was often characterized by sharp peaks associated with elements of the retinal microvasculature, but, in the outer retina, the oxygen distribution was much more predictable and reflected the high oxygen uptake of the photoreceptors. Average choroidal oxygen tension was 42.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (mean +/- SE), and P(O2) at the surface of the retina was 21.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg. The average minimum oxygen tension in the outer retina was 4.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg.

A main problem in clinical islet transplantation is the fact that only a small percentage of allogeneic islet-transplanted type 1 diabetic patients can completely omit insulin injections after transplantation. One reason for the impaired survival of islet grafts is aberration of the function of islets due to toxic agents, including oxygen radicals and nitric oxide, which arise during warm or cold ischemic time. Therefore, in clinical islet transplantation, islets have been preserved with a mixture of antioxidants to reduce free radical-mediated damage of transplanted beta cells. Our aim was to examine hepatic tissue after metabolic normalization following intraportal islet transplantation after application of sulforaphane.\nIslets were isolated from pancreata of WAG rats. Sulforaphane (24 mg/kg) was administered 24 hours before isolated islets were transplanted into the liver through the portal vein (1200 +/- 100 per rat). At 9 months after transplantation the animals were killed and liver tissue removed for morphological examination.\nThis report indicated that the intrahepatic portal vein site was indeed an excellent locus for implantation of free pancreatic islets. The islet grafts developed rich vascularization derived from both venous and arterial sources. The islet cells maintained their structural and functional integrity after implantation.\nOur results showed that sulforaphane improved islet function in vivo, indicating that combination of a free radical scavenger and an antioxidant (sulforaphane) may be used to increase the effectiveness of islet transplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2006-03-01", "authors": ["ESolowiej", "JSolowiej", "MGodlewski", "TMotyl", "APerkowska-Ptasi\u0144ska", "KJa\u015bkiewicz", "TKasprzycka-Guttman", "WRowi\u0144ski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2005.11.074"}

In view of their wide distribution in the organism, they play various roles in, for example, type I hypersensitivity reactions, chronic inflammatory processes, tissue reconstruction and wound healing, and pathological pulmonary fibrosis. They also play a role in angiogenesis, both in normal conditions during tissue regeneration and in pathological neoplastic states. The microcirculation provides building and nutritional substances to cancer cells and enables cancer spread via the blood. On the other hand, a tumor with good vascularization is more prone to penetration by cytostatics, which is why angiogenesis is a very important process in the course of neoplastic disease. Many authors indicate a close association between mast cells and angiogenesis. Some substances contained in the cytoplasm of these cells are potent stimulators of angiogenesis (tryptase, heparin), while others may inhibit it (protamine, platelet factor 4), and this conditions cancer growth and the development of the metastatic process.

Anatomical study and clinical applications].", "abstract": "The authors report a new cutaneous flap harvested from the dorsal and distal quarter of the forearm: the dorsoradial flap. The vascularisation type of the cutaneous paddle belongs this flap to the anterograde and axial family flaps. The anatomical study carried out on thirty six fresh cadaver upper arms showed a constant and a consistent cutaneous collateral branch of the radial artery which arises at the apex of the first intermetacarpal space. Two anatomical types were recorded according to the origin of the dorsoradial artery: type I (84% of cases), the vessel arises directly from the radial artery; type II (16% of cases), it arises from a common trunk with the first dorsal intermetacarpal artery. Those anatomical findings does not influence the flap operative technique, the flap design and the location of the pedicle pivot point. The dorsoradial artery emerges vertically from the apex of the first intermetacarpal space, crosses the angle between the extensor pollicis longus tendon laterally and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendon medially and turns proximally towards the distal radio-ulnar joint. Over the dorsal aspect of the wrist, the dorsoradial artery enters the subcutaneous tissue, runs parallel to the extensor pollicis longus tendon at three millimeters in a medial position, passes over the medial collateral branch of the superficial radial nerve and irrigates all the distal and dorsal quarter of the forearm. The artery is consistently accompanied by two comitantes veins, which assume the venous drainage of the cutaneous territory. The flap paddle is designed over the distal dorsal forearm quarter, between the dorsal crease of the wrist distally, the ulnar crest medially and the radial crest laterally. All this skin territory can be harvested and supplied by the dorsoradial pedicle, but we always should deal with the needs of the defects reconstruction and the morbidity of the donor site. The vascular pedicle is outlined between the distal radio-ulnar joint and the apex of the first intermetacarpal space with a minimum of one centimeter width. The surgical procedure is carried out under a tourniquet without an upper arm exsanguination. The skin is firstly dissected over the vascular pedicle through an S shape incision; it is lifted on the dermo-hypodermis plan preserving all the superficial venous network with the pedicle. The flap is elevated from proximal to distal including the dorsal forearm fascia. Over the dorsal extensor retinaculum, the dissection is underwent close to it elevating all the subcutaneous tissues. The medial collateral branch of the superficial radial nerve should be identified and respected. At the distal border of the dorsal retinaculum, the extensor pollicis longus and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendons are identified and retracted. The pedicle dissection goes deeper between this two tendons towards the first web space. It takes all the areolar tissue around the pedicle in order to preserve the venous network of the cutaneous paddle. The donor site is closed primarily if the skin width does not exceed 3 cm or grafted secondarily. Its large rotational arc allows the cutaneous paddle to cover the dorsal hand and metacarpo-phalangeal long fingers defects, the dorsal aspect of the thumb and the first intermetacarpal space. It can also safely reach the palmar aspect of the wrist. We report four clinical cases where the dorsoradial flap was successfully applied.

Here we show that platelet-derived CD154 is sufficient to initiate cardiac allograft rejection independent of any cellular source of this molecule. CD154-KO mice reject cardiac allografts after receiving CD154-expressing human platelets or recombinant CD154 (rCD154) trimers. Treatment with the human CD154-specific mAb 5c8 specifically prevents this induced rejection. Soluble trimers, but not platelets, induce rejection when infused temporally remote from the surgical procedure, suggesting that surgically induced platelet activation is required for CD154 release. Allograft rejection can thus be instigated by activated platelets through CD154.

Current agents impose serious limitations on medical imaging: short imaging times, the need for catheterization in many cases, occasional renal toxicity, and poor contrast in large patients. This report is the first demonstration that gold nanoparticles may overcome these limitations. Gold has higher absorption than iodine with less bone and tissue interference achieving better contrast with lower X-ray dose. Nanoparticles clear the blood more slowly than iodine agents, permitting longer imaging times. Gold nanoparticles, 1.9 nm in diameter, were injected intravenously into mice and images recorded over time with a standard mammography unit. Gold biodistribution was measured by atomic absorption. Retention in liver and spleen was low with elimination by the kidneys. Organs such as kidneys and tumours were seen with unusual clarity and high spatial resolution. Blood vessels less than 100 microm in diameter were delineated, thus enabling in vivo vascular casting. Regions of increased vascularization and angiogenesis could be distinguished. With 10 mg Au ml(-1) initially in the blood, mouse behaviour was unremarkable and neither blood plasma analytes nor organ histology revealed any evidence of toxicity 11 days and 30 days after injection.

{"title": "Endothelial cells express a matrix protein which binds activated factor XII in a zinc-independent manner.", "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that peptides identified as surface binding regions of high molecular mass kininogen (HK) and factor XII (FXII) inhibit the Zn(2+)-dependent binding of FXII to confluent layers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This indicates that negatively charged FXII binding surfaces, such as sulfatides and dextran sulfate, may interfere with the binding of FXII to confluent layer of HUVEC. Upon investigating this hypothesis it was unexpectedly found that sulfatides enhanced a specific binding of FXII to a matrix protein expressed during growth of the endothelial cells and that this binding was independent of the presence of Zn(2+). The function of sulfatides was partly to minimize nonspecific electrostatic binding and partly to induce and enhance autoactivation of FXII generating alphaFXIIa. Western blot analysis of the extracts of the matrix incubated with FXII and sulfatides showed that the binding was specific for alphaFXIIa. The dissociation constant for binding alphaFXIIa was 12.8 +/- 0.4 nM (n = 4). The binding of alphaFXIIa to ECM was mapped to the heavy chain as no binding was observed of the light chain containing the catalytic domain. HK, which previously has been shown to completely abolish the Zn(2+)-dependent binding of FXII to confluent layers of HUVEC, did not inhibit the binding of alphaFXIIa to the matrix but sulfatides enhanced binding of FXII to ECM. This suggests that HK interferes with the binding of FXII to sulfatides and thereby the autoactivation of FXII. Trypsin treatment of the matrix protein completely abolished the binding, and fibronectin but not laminin was found to be a suitable target. The binding of activated FXII to the ECM suggests that FXIIa may be a modulator of cellular adhesion, migration and vascularization.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2006-02-24", "authors": ["IngerSchousboe"], "doi": "10.1160/TH05-06-0458"}

To increase the efficacy of anticancer treatments, efforts must be made to find new strategies for transiently opening the tumor vascular bed to alleviate tumor hypoxia (source of resistance to radiotherapy) and improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesized that Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) could interfere with neurotransmitter release at the perivascular sympathetic varicosities, leading to inhibition of the neurogenic contractions of tumor vessels and therefore improving tumor perfusion and oxygenation.\nTo test this hypothesis, BoNT-A was injected locally into mouse tumors (fibrosarcoma FSaII, hepatocarcinoma transplantable liver tumor), and electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry was used to monitor pO(2) in vivo repeatedly for 4 days. Additionally, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure tumor perfusion in vivo. Finally, isolated arteries were mounted in wire myograph to monitor specifically the neurogenic tone developed by arterioles that were co-opted by the surrounding growing tumor cells.\nUsing these tumor models, we showed that local administration of BoNT-A (two sites; dose, 29 units/kg) substantially increases tumor oxygenation and perfusion, leading to a substantial improvement in the tumor response to radiotherapy (20 Gy of 250-kV radiation) and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg). This observed therapeutic gain results from an opening of the tumor vascular bed by BoNT-A because we showed that BoNT-A could inhibit neurogenic tone in the tumor vasculature.\nThe opening of the vascular bed induced by BoNT-A offers a way to significantly increase the response of tumors to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2006-02-21", "authors": ["R\u00e9ginaldAnsiaux", "ChristineBaudelet", "Greg OCron", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meSegers", "ChantalDessy", "PhilippeMartinive", "JulieDe Wever", "JulienVerrax", "Val\u00e9rieWauthier", "NelsonBeghein", "VincentGr\u00e9goire", "PedroBuc Calderon", "OlivierFeron", "BernardGallez"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1222"}

We have shown that the antiangiogenic effect of HRGP is dependent on its histidine/proline-rich domain, which needs to be released from the mother protein to exert its effects. Here we identify a 35-amino-acid peptide, HRGP330, derived from the histidine/proline-rich domain as endowed with antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of action of HRGP330 involves subversion of focal adhesion function by disruption of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK substrate alpha-actinin, and, as a consequence, an arrest in endothelial cell motility. The disturbed focal adhesion function is reflected in the ability of HRGP as well as of HRGP330 to prevent endothelial cell adhesion to vitronectin in a manner involving alpha(v)beta3 integrin. In conclusion, HRGP330, which we define as the minimal antiangiogenic domain of HRGP, exerts its effects through signal transduction targeting focal adhesions, thereby interrupting VEGF-induced endothelial cell motility.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2006-02-21", "authors": ["JohanDixelius", "Anna-KarinOlsson", "AsaThulin", "ChunsikLee", "IrjaJohansson", "LenaClaesson-Welsh"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2217"}

The cornea of the affected eye was vascularized and completely cloudy without a sharp border between cornea and sclera. The diagnosis of a congenital glaucoma was made but an operation was not undertaken because of the difficult anatomical situation and the lost function. When the child was almost 3 years old enucleation was performed to prevent complications due to corneal exposure, and to improve the cosmetic aspect.\nThe morphological investigations of the enucleated eye disclosed findings typical of what is called in the literature \"congenital anterior staphyloma\" or \"congenital corneal staphyloma\", namely a massively staphylomatous cornea with superficial neovascularization, destruction of Bowman's layer, and absence of Descemet's layer as well as corneal endothelium. Angle structures were completely absent, and the corneal back-side was lined by a pigment epithelial layer and focally by an additional inner layer of non-pigmented epithelium. There was no anterior chamber. The lens was markedly diminished in size (microphakia) and partly embedded in the corneal stroma. Pars muscularis and pars ciliaris of the ciliary body were separated. Elongated, thin ciliary processes were extended towards the small lens while the pars muscularis was fully covered by the retina.\nThis rare, complex malformation syndrome which can be easily distinguished from primary congenital glaucoma should not be reduced conceptually to the corneal staphyloma because this staphyloma constitutes only a part of the whole. Taking the leading morphological aberrations into consideration we would rather propose the new term \" corneal staphyloma- anterior chamber agenesia- microphakia syndrome (CSAMS). We hypothesize that CSAMS may be due to a pathological fusion of the early anterior optic cup.

Thus, high levels are found in highly vascularized organs such as the lung, brain, and placenta; intermediate levels in the heart, kidney, intestine, testes, and uterus; and low levels in the spleen, thymus, and liver. Several cell types are known to express TF constitutively, such as astrocytes in the brain, epithelial cells enveloping organs and body surfaces, adventitial fibroblasts and pericytes, and cardial myocytes in the heart. Smooth muscle cells in the media of the vessel wall and monocytes/macrophages contain small amounts of TF, which is enhanced substantially upon activation of the cells. Endothelial cells probably do not express TF. The popular concept of TF serving predominantly as a hemostatic envelope encapsulating the vascular bed has been challenged recently by the observation that blood of healthy individuals may form TF-induced thrombi under conditions entailing shear stress and activated platelets, corroborating the notion of blood-borne TF. Accordingly, small amounts of decrypted TF activity is detected in calcium ionophore-stimulated monocytes, and microparticles from plasma of healthy subjects possess TF-like activity subject to partial inactivation by anti-TF antibody. In addition to microparticles, plasma TF also comprises the soluble alternatively spliced human TF and truncated TF, both of which probably require factor VIIa to be physiologically active. Although it has been suggested that activated platelets possess active TF, the notion of TF as an integral platelet component is contested by more recent data.

The first strategies, aimed at inhibiting tumor vascularization, included upregulation of endogenous inhibitors and blocking of the signals delivered by angiogenic factors. But interaction between endothelial cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix also plays a critical role in the modulation of the angiogenic process. This study introduces a new concept to enhance the efficacy of antibody-based antiangiogenic cancer therapy strategies, taking advantage of a key molecular event occurring in the tumor context: the proteolysis of collagen XVIII, which releases the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin. By fusing the collagen XVIII NC1 domain to an antiangiogenic single-chain antibody, a multispecific agent was generated, which was efficiently processed by tumor-associated proteinases to produce monomeric endostatin and fully functional trimeric antibody fragments. It was demonstrated that the combined production in the tumor area of complementary antiangiogenic agents from a single molecular entity secreted by gene-modified cells resulted in enhanced antitumor effects.

In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Eph receptors and their ligands, ephrins, as their participation in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis has become apparent. The Eph receptor family is the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases identified to date. The Eph receptors and their membrane-anchored ligands, ephrins, are unique in that they mediate bi-directional signalling. This is concomitant with activation of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase domain and transduction of the typical forward signal into the receptor-bearing cell. The ligand-receptor interaction also leads to transduction of a reverse signal into the ephrin-bearing cell. The Eph/ephrin signalling mechanism is responsible for diverse and complex biological functions mediated by Eph receptors and ephrin ligands. These include vascular development, tissue-border formation, cell migration, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity. The role of Eph receptors and ephrins in the processes of development of the cardiovascular system, angiogenesis, and vascular remodelling has been the subject of intense investigation since they were first identified in 1987. This review addresses the role of this new growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family in those processes and provides new insights into the way in which Eph receptors and ephrin ligands modulate the angiogenic response and participate in vascular remodelling and vascular boundary formation during development of the cardiovascular system and vascularization of cancer.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2006-02-14", "authors": ["JZhang", "SeHughes"], "doi": "10.1002/path.1937"}

Today, the DP flap is often overlooked; although its role has diminished, its use is still warranted in certain select clinical situations.\nA retrospective patient chart review of 25 DP flap procedures performed at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and Iowa City Veterans Administration Hospital between January 1, 1991, and June 1, 2002, was undertaken. The data collected included patient demographics and assessment of DP flap survival and its ability to accomplish established preoperative reconstructive goals.\nThe DP flap was used for the following situations: vascularized skin coverage of the neck, carotid arteries, and face (16 cases), including simultaneous coverage of other reconstructive flaps in 6 cases; controlled orocutaneous fistula development (3 cases) or fistula closure (5 cases); and pharyngoesophageal reconstruction (4 cases). In 3 cases the flap was used for more than one of the preoperative goals described above (n = 25). Minor flap-related complications that required local wound treatment developed in 5 cases (20.0%), but the flaps were successfully salvaged and no subsequent reconstructive procedure was required. In an additional 5 cases (20.0%), the flap failed in some measure to accomplish its preoperative goal, necessitating further surgical reconstruction. Sixteen patients (64%) had undergone previous or simultaneous reconstructive procedures that limited other available reconstructive options.\nThe technical simplicity of the DP flap, coupled with its predictable vascular supply, has allowed it to maintain a niche role in contemporary reconstructive surgery. The DP flap provides an excellent method of reconstruction in select cases in which vascularized skin coverage of the neck is needed. The DP flap also provides a valuable salvage option in situations in which other reconstructive techniques are not possible.", "journal": "The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology", "date": "2006-02-10", "authors": ["Brian TAndrews", "Timothy MMcCulloch", "Gerry FFunk", "Scott MGraham", "Henry THoffman"], "doi": "10.1177/000348940611500106"}

Five ewes were investigated using contrast-enhanced power Doppler after Sonovue injection at day 0, 3, 5, 10 and 13 of the cycle in two successive estrus cycles. Transvaginal ultrasound monitoring of each ewe was performed after a dose of Sonovue. Parameters derived from the time-intensity curves were compared. Quantification of the enhancement and wash-in period parameters changed significantly between ovaries and between the follicular and luteal periods of the cycle. Uptake time, wash-out time, total time of enhancement and area under the curve were the parameters with the smallest variation between ovaries. Wash-out time and area under the curve are two contrast parameters that did not change with cyclic changes.

Our purpose was to define the area and chronology of NRBC appearance in the mouse embryonic heart at the stages before a patency between coronary vessels and peripheral circulation is established (10.5-13.5 dpc). Before and at the onset of vascularization, NBCs were not present within the proepicardium; however, Ter/119+ differentiating erythroblasts and single scattered CD45+ were found in the heart beginning from 10.5 dpc. The Ter/119+ cells were in close apposition to angioblasts (PECAM1+) and were recognized as components of blood island-like structures or vascular vesicles in transmission electron microscope and were located mostly in the subepicardium. Some of the NRBCs were not accompanied by angioblasts and located close to the endocardial endothelium or at the border of the endocardial endothelium or in the subepicardium. These erythroblasts were beginning to assemble with angioblasts. CD34+ NBCs as well as progenitor cells of erythroid lineage were not detected in the heart at these stages of development. The state of differentiation of NRBCs of blood islands was similar/the same as the morphology of circulating blood cells at the respective stages of embryo development. The presence of mature NRBCs in the subendocardial area and lack of progenitor cells of erythroid lineage within the heart indicate that erythroid commitment occurs outside the heart. We suggest that NRBCs enter the heart from the blood stream at 10.5-12 dpc independently from angioblasts.", "journal": "The anatomical record.

To preserve fertility, cryopreservation and subsequent transplantation of the ovaries have been suggested. One of the challenges in ovarian graft transplantation is overcoming the initial ischaemic damage that depletes a significant fraction of the oocyte pool.\nFollicular survival in ovarian grafts was examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence microscopy in a model system in which rat ovaries were transplanted into nude mice. Transplantation into angiogenic granulation tissue created during wound healing shortened the ischaemic period by 24 h and significantly increased the pool of healthy primordial follicles and the perfused area of the transplanted grafts. Functional blood vessels were detected within the grafts as early as 2 days after transplantation. Gain of function was demonstrated both by growth of the grafts and by the hormonal influence on the host uteri.\nImplantation of ovarian grafts into an angiogenic granulation tissue improved graft vascularization and follicular survival.

The anterolateral thigh flap has come recently into use in the field of head and neck reconstruction. Its role in craniofacial and midface reconstruction has not been specifically defined. This study involved a total of 18 patients who were treated over a 5-year period from 1998 to 2003. Seventeen patients had locally advanced head and neck cancer, requiring craniofacial resection, and one patient had a complicated gun shot wound of the forehead. Thirteen patients were treated at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt, and five patients at the University of Miami, Florida. The patients presented with defects of the anterior skull base (5), lateral skull base (3), scalp and calvarium (3), and the midface (7). The anterolateral thigh flap was used as a myocutaneous flap in 11 cases and as a perforator fasciocutaneous flap in seven cases. Musculocutaneous perforators supplied the majority of flaps (17/18). Total flap survival occurred in 17 cases; one patient developed complete flap necrosis. The most commonly used recipient vessels were the facial vessels and the external jugular vein. Major complications included one case with meningitis; the patient died after failure of treatment. Another patient died 6 weeks postoperatively from pulmonary embolism. One patient developed CSF leak that stopped spontaneously. In addition, two patients developed minor wound dehiscence that healed spontaneously. The donor-site wound healed without problems except in two cases. One patient had an incomplete take of the skin graft; the other developed wound infection and superficial sloughing. Both wounds healed spontaneously. In addition to the feasibility of simultaneous flap harvesting with tumor resection, the flap's advantage in skull base reconstruction is its reliable blood supply, which can provide adequate dural cover and protection of the brain. Its size and moderate thickness are suitable for reconstruction of scalp and calvarial defects. The abundance of reliably vascularized fat in the flap may be an advantage in long-term maintenance of the volume of the flap in midface reconstruction.

{"title": "New strategies for cardiovascular gene therapy: regulatable pre-emptive expression of pro-angiogenic and antioxidant genes.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are among the major targets for gene therapy. Initially, clinical experiments of gene transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improved vascularization and prevented the amputation in patients with critical leg ischemia. However, the majority of trials did not provide conclusive results and therefore further preclinical studies are required. Importantly, data indicate the necessity of regulated expression of angiogenic factors, particularly VEGF, to obtain the therapeutic effect. It is also suggested that the combined delivery of two or more genes may improve the formation of mature vasculature and therefore may be more effective in the amelioration of ischemia. Moreover, experimental approaches in animal models displayed the promise of gene transfer modulating the inflammatory processes and oxidant status of the cells. Particularly, the concept of preemptive gene therapy has been tested, and recent studies have demonstrated that overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 or extracellular superoxide dismutase can prevent heart injury by myocardial infarction induced several weeks after gene instillation. The combination of a preemptive strategy with regulated gene expression, using the vectors in which the therapeutic transgene is driven by exogenously or endogenously controllable promoter, offers another modality. However, we hypothesize that regulatable gene therapy, dependent on the activity of endogenous factors, might be prone to limitations owing to the potential disturbance in the expression of endogenous genes. Here, we demonstrated some indications of these drawbacks. Therefore, the final acceptance of these promising strategies for clinical trials requires careful validation in animal experiments.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2006-02-04", "authors": ["JozefDulak", "AnnaZagorska", "BarbaraWegiel", "AgnieszkaLoboda", "AlicjaJozkowicz"], "doi": "10.1385/CBB:44:1:031"}

To address this question we studied host class I MHC-restricted, male transplantation Ag-reactive T cell responses in female recipients of fully MHC-disparate, male heart transplants.

VHL operates along two pathways with the first involving hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha degradation and down-regulation of its proangiogenic target genes vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-beta, and the second pathway promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. Secretion of proangiogenic factors was shown to be a primary inducer of angiogenesis. Here, we show that loss of ECM assembly correlates with tumor angiogenesis in VHL disease. Upon inactivation of the VHL-ECM assembly pathway, we observe tumors that are highly vascularized, have a disrupted ECM, and show increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity. Loss of the VHL pathway leading to hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha degradation results in tumors with increased vascular endothelial growth factor levels but with surprisingly low microvessel density, a tightly assembled ECM and low invasive ability.

Although studies suggest that hypercapnia impacts tissue neovascularization, its significance relative to the abundantly described effects of hypoxia and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hypercapnia on blood vessel growth in models of developmental and ischemic neovascularization. Acute and prolonged CO2 exposure inhibited developmental neovascularization of the rodent retina, as well as revascularization of the ischemic retina. Hypercapnia induced early increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitrative stress, associated with astrocyte impairment and endothelial cell death, as well as downregulation of the proangiogenic prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3.

In the present study, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were harvested as intact sheets from temperature-responsive culture dishes and stacked into cell-dense myocardial tissues. However, the thickness limit for layered cell sheets in subcutaneous tissue was approximately 80 microm (3 layers). To overcome this limitation, repeated transplantation of triple-layer grafts was performed at 1, 2, or 3 day intervals. The two overlaid grafts completely synchronized and the whole tissues survived without necrosis in the 1 or 2 day interval cases.

Nevertheless, there have been few basic investigations of the pathogenesis of these xanthomas. To clarify the pathogenesis of these xanthomas, we examined the localization and histopathological features of xanthomatous tissues in the extremities of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits.\nTwenty-six WHHL rabbits at 1-31 months of age were dissected to observe the localization of xanthomas. In the histopathological study, tendons and ligaments that included xanthomatous tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and toluidine blue. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with RAM-11, a monoclonal antibody specific for rabbit macrophages, and CD31, a monoclonal antibody specific for endothelial cells.\nAt necropsy examination, spontaneous development of xanthomas was observed in the plantar side of the plantaris tendon, the flexor retinaculum of the carpus, and around the digital flexor tendons of each joint level. Xanthoma formation was observed from 10 months of age and progressed with advancing age. The histomorphological study revealed that xanthomas had developed in superficial paratenon of the tendons that wrap around bony or fibrous pulleys. Many fibrocartilage cells were observed in the deep side of affected tendons. A large number of blood vessels were seen in the xanthomatous tissues of these WHHL rabbits. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the xanthoma plaques contained endothelial cells and macrophages.\nIt is likely that mechanical stress and extensive vascularization are essential factors for xanthoma formation. Moreover, endothelial cells and macrophages cells are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of tendinous xanthomas and to atherogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association", "date": "2006-01-27", "authors": ["AtsushiNakano", "MitsuoKinoshita", "RyuzoOkuda", "ToshitoYasuda", "MuneakiAbe", "MasashiShiomi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00776-005-0976-7"}

We have evaluated the possibility of promoting significantly allograft survival in a vascularized cardiac allograft model by performing ex vivo gene transfer. We used a lentiviral vector encoding the chemokine antagonist RANTES 9-68 that is capable of competing with native RANTES.\nThe Fisher donor/Lewis recipient rat strain combinations were used and all animals received for the first 5 days posttransplantation a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporine A (1.5 mg/kg). Ex vivo gene transfer into heart allograft was performed by multiple injections of the SIN.cPPT lentiviral vector, which corresponds to the multiply attenuated, self-inactivating lentivector derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1.\nAbout 6% of the cardiac tissue had integrated lentiviral vector, which closely matches the mean in vivo RANTES antagonist expression of 5% obtained by immunohistochemistry. In vivo RANTES 9-68 expression has significantly prolonged graft survival (median [25%-75%]: 20 [17-26] days), compared to the control 15 ([14-15] days; P=0.0007). Furthermore, hearts transduced with RANTES 9-68 showed a significant (P<0.05) reduction in cell infiltration and intragraft expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, endogenous RANTES, and TGF-beta.\nLentiviral gene transfer of RANTES 9-68 antagonist attenuates significantly the inflammatory response and delays allograft rejection, despite low levels of transduction.

Our aim was to assess the ability of syngeneic adult islets seeded into blood vessel-containing chambers to correct streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice. Approximately 350 syngeneic islets suspended in Matrigel extracellular matrix were inserted into chambers based on either the splenic or groin (epigastric) vascular beds, or, in the standard approach, injected under the renal capsule. Blood glucose was monitored weekly for 7 weeks, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test performed at 6 weeks in the presence of the islet grafts. Relative to untreated diabetic animals, glycemic control significantly improved in all islet transplant groups, strongly correlating with islet counts in the graft (P<0.01), and with best results in the splenic chamber group. Glycemic control deteriorated after chambers were surgically removed at week 8. Immunohistochemistry revealed islets with abundant insulin content in grafts from all groups, but with significantly more islets in splenic chamber grafts than the other treatment groups (P<0.05).

{"title": "CYR61 (CCN1) protein expression during fracture healing in an ovine tibial model and its relation to the mechanical fixation stability.", "abstract": "The formation of new blood vessels is a prerequisite for bone healing. CYR61 (CCN1), an extracellular matrix-associated signaling protein, is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis and mesenchymal stem cell expansion and differentiation. A recent study showed that CYR61 is expressed during fracture healing and suggested that CYR61 plays a significant role in cartilage and bone formation. The hypothesis of the present study was that decreased fixation stability, which leads to a delay in healing, would lead to reduced CYR61 protein expression in fracture callus. The aim of the study was to quantitatively analyze CYR61 protein expression, vascularization, and tissue differentiation in the osteotomy gap and relate to the mechanical fixation stability during the course of healing. A mid-shaft osteotomy of the tibia was performed in two groups of sheep and stabilized with either a rigid or semirigid external fixator, each allowing different amounts of interfragmentary movement. The sheep were sacrificed at 2, 3, 6, and 9 weeks postoperatively. The tibiae were tested biomechanically and histological sections from the callus were analyzed immunohistochemically with regard to CYR61 protein expression and vascularization. Expression of CYR61 protein was upregulated at the early phase of fracture healing (2 weeks), decreasing over the healing time. Decreased fixation stability was associated with a reduced upregulation of the CYR61 protein expression and a reduced vascularization at 2 weeks leading to a slower healing. The maximum cartilage callus fraction in both groups was reached at 3 weeks. However, the semirigid fixator group showed a significantly lower CYR61 immunoreactivity in cartilage than the rigid fixator group at this time point. The fraction of cartilage in the semirigid fixator group was not replaced by bone as quickly as in the rigid fixator group leading to an inferior histological and mechanical callus quality at 6 weeks and therefore to a slower healing. The results supply further evidence that CYR61 may serve as an important regulator of bone healing.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society", "date": "2006-01-26", "authors": ["JasminLienau", "HannaSchell", "Devakara REpari", "NorbertSch\u00fctze", "FranzJakob", "Georg NDuda", "Hermann JBail"], "doi": "10.1002/jor.20035"}

The understanding and control of these vascularization processes are a key factor for creating thicker functional tissues. Here, we show that cardiac cell sheets express angiogenesis-related genes and form endothelial cell networks in culture. After non-invasive harvest and stacking of cell sheets using temperature-responsive culture dishes, these endothelial cell networks are maintained and result in neovascularization upon in vivo transplantation. Interestingly, we also discovered that all of the graft vessels are derived from the grafts themselves and these vessels migrate to connect with the host vasculature. Finally, blood vessel formation within the grafts can be controlled by changing the ratio of endothelial cells.

Engineering tissues in the subcutaneous space is an attractive method; however, hepatocyte survival has been transient due to insufficient vascular network formation. To establish a vascularized cavity, we created a polyethylene terephthalate mesh device coated with poly(vinylalcohol) that allowed for the gradual release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a potent angiogenic factor. The efficacy of the bFGF-releasing device in inducing vascular network formation in the subcutaneous space was observed in mouse and rat studies. Isolated mouse hepatocytes transplanted into newly vascularized subcutaneous cavities allowed for persistent survival up to 120 days. In the absence of a vascularized compartment, the survival of the transplanted hepatocytes was markedly diminished. Functional maintenance of the engineered hepatic tissues was confirmed by high expression of liver-specific mRNAs and proteins. These engineered hepatic tissues have the ability to take up inoculated compounds and express strong induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes, demonstrating functional relevance as a metabolic tissue.

Some 246 patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and evidence of saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal reflux were allocated randomly to receive either conservative management or surgical treatment. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 24 months following randomization was calculated.\nTotal NHS costs during the 2-year study period were higher for the surgically treated group (733 UK pounds) than for those who had conservative treatment (345 UK pounds). The difference in costs was statistically significant. The mean incremental health gain from surgical treatment at 24 months was 0.083 QALYs, leading to a base-case estimate of 4682 UK pounds per QALY gained. Assuming an implicit threshold maximum willingness-to-pay value of 20 000 UK pounds for a QALY, the probability of surgical treatment for varicose veins falling below this threshold value was 70 per cent.

A histological analysis of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's geese (C. rossii).", "abstract": "Most birds develop brood patches before incubation; epidermis and dermis in the brood patch region thicken, and the dermal connective tissue becomes increasingly vascularized and infiltrated by leukocytes. However, current dogma states that waterfowl incubate without modifications of skin within the brood patch region. The incubation periods of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens; hereafter called snow geese) and Ross's geese (C. rossii) are 2-6 days shorter than those of other goose species; only females incubate. Thus, we hypothesized that such short incubation periods would require fully developed brood patches for sufficient heat transfer from incubating parents to eggs. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the skin histology of abdominal regions of snow and Ross's geese collected at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. For female snow geese, we found that epidermis and dermis had thickened and vascularization of dermis was 14 times greater, on average, than that observed in males (n=5 pairs). Our results for Ross's geese (n=5 pairs) were more variable, wherein only one of five female Ross's geese fully developed a brood patch. Our results are consistent with three hypotheses about brood patch development and its relationship with different energetic cost-benefit relationships, resulting from differences in embryonic development and body size.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

{"title": "Effects of geldanamycin on HIF-1alpha mediated angiogenesis and invasion in prostate cancer cells.", "abstract": "Geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin, is a naturally occurring inhibitor of heat shock protein (Hsp90), which regulates the transcription activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha). Under hypoxia, HIF-1alpha is activated in tumor cells, and induces the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is the prime regulator for angiogenesis. VEGF promotes the formation of new blood vessels by stimulating endothelial cell division and migration. This eventually forms a vascular network that allows for tumor growth and metastasis. In this study, we used GA to inhibit HIF-1alpha transcription function. Human prostate cancer DU-145 cells were incubated in a hypoxic chamber at 1% O(2) and 37 degrees C for different durations. Both mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF were upregulated under hypoxic conditions. We demonstrated that GA treatment of hypoxic DU-145 cells abolished the induction of HIF-1alpha protein in a time-dependent manner and decreased VEGF mRNA and its protein levels. The transient transfection of DU-145 cells with luciferase reporter gene construct (5HRE/hCMVmp-luc) showed that the transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha was significantly induced in response to hypoxia, but inhibited by GA. In addition, using conditioned medium from GA-treated hypoxic cells led to a significant decrease in cell invasion in comparison with using conditioned medium from nontreated hypoxic cells. These data provide evidence for the important role of GA in inhibition of angiogenesis and also invasion mediated by HIF-1alpha in prostate cancer cells.", "journal": "Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases", "date": "2006-01-25", "authors": ["OAlqawi", "MMoghaddas", "GSingh"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.pcan.4500852"}

Torques were applied to a maximum of 2.0 N m. The range-of-motion and neutral-zone values measured in each loading mode were compared.

Here, we demonstrate that endothelial cells of human malignant brain tumors also express guidance molecules, such as EphB4 and its ligand ephrinB2. To study their function, EphB4 variants were overexpressed in blood vessels of tumor xenografts. Our studies revealed that EphB4 acts as a negative regulator of blood vessel branching and vascular network formation, switching the vascularization program from sprouting angiogenesis to circumferential vessel growth. In parallel, EphB4 reduces the permeability of the tumor vascular system via activation of the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 system at the endothelium/pericyte interface. Furthermore, overexpression of EphB4 variants in blood vessels during (i) vascularization of non-neoplastic cell grafts and (ii) retinal vascularization revealed that these functions of EphB4 apply to postnatal, non-neoplastic angiogenesis in general.

Following intravenous injection of alphaCD3epsilon antibody (alphaCD3epsilonAb) we observed clear differences in antibody binding to Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)(+) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or T lymphocytes in different organs. Significant binding of blood-borne alphaCD3epsilonAb was only detected in the spleen and liver and not in the thymus or lymph node. In the spleen, only 10% of dendritic cells/macrophages and 40% of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta(+) cells were positive for alphaCD3epsilonAb, and, dependent on FcgammaR-mediated cross-linking of alphaCD3epsilonAb, a similar percentage of splenic TCR-beta(+) cells were stimulated and became CD69(+). Stimulation of TCR-beta(+) cells in the liver was at least as efficient as in the spleen, but almost all T cells and all scavenger liver sinusoidal endothelial cells bound alphaCD3epsilonAb. In contrast to CD69 up-regulation, only CD4(+) natural killer T (NKT) cells and CD11a(high) CD8(+) T cells were activated by alphaCD3epsilonAb and expressed interferon (IFN)-gamma. Again, IFN-gamma release from NKT/T cells was at least as efficient in the liver as in the spleen.

The present study investigates cardiac allograft survival and the mechanism of long-term acceptance in recipient swine following cotransplantation of VTL and cardiac grafts from fully MHC-mismatched donors.\nAnimals received a heart graft, a heart graft and a VTL, or a heart graft and a donor thymocyte infusion. Immunosuppressive regimens consisted of 12 or 28 days of tacrolimus.\nAll animals that received a VTL maintained their grafts significantly longer than their counterparts that received only a heart graft, and those receiving 28 days of tacrolimus maintained their heart grafts long-term. Recipients of a donor thymocyte infusion demonstrated slightly prolonged cardiac graft survival but all rejected their grafts, highlighting the importance of thymic stroma. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against third-party antigens by cells from tolerant animals showed restriction by both self and donor MHC, whereas responses of controls were restricted to self MHC only. The presence of donor dendritic cells in the VTL grafts and results of co-culture assays suggest that both central and regulatory mechanisms were involved in achieving long-term acceptance.\nThis is the first demonstration of the long-term acceptance of fully MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts in large animals.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2006-01-20", "authors": ["ShujiNobori", "EmmaSamelson-Jones", "AkiraShimizu", "YosukeHisashi", "ShinYamamoto", "ChisakoKamano", "KatsuhitoTeranishi", "Parsia AVagefi", "MathewNuhn", "MasayoshiOkumi", "BannyWong", "StuartHouser", "David HSachs", "KazuhikoYamada"], "doi": "10.1097/01.tp.0000200368.03991.e0"}

Quantitative analysis of tumor blood flow is a prerequisite for developing novel treatment strategies such as antiangiogenic and antivascular treatment options. Laser Doppler flow in malignant melanomas has been shown to be increased compared with normal skin and melanocytic nevi. This study investigated whether this phenomenon is originated by elevated blood vessel density or by reactive hyperemia.\nLaser Doppler flow was studied in 35 melanocytic nevi, 22 malignant melanomas and three basal cell carcinomas. After excision digital imaging analysis was performed in microtome sections (factor VIII-associated antigen and CD 31 labelled). The ratio of vessel area in histological sections from tumor tissue and in non-lesional skin was calculated and related to Doppler flow values.\nMalignant melanomas demonstrated an enlargement of vessel cross-sectional area by factor 3.7+/-1.9 and of Doppler flow by factor 10.56+/-10.7, and melanocytic nevi accomplished increase of vessel cross-sectional area by factor 1.7+/-0.9 and of Doppler flow by factor 2.7+/-3.5.\nThe laser Doppler flow is influenced by the number and the velocity of erythrocytes in the tissue. The greater increase of laser Doppler flow than of vessel density in histological sections demonstrates that the flow signal in skin tumors is caused by neovascularization as well as by functional hyperemia.

{"title": "Evaluations of the renal cell carcinoma model Caki-1 using a silicon based microvascular casting technique.", "abstract": "The vascular development of orthotopically grown human renal cell carcinoma (Caki-1) was examined using a silicon based casting technique in nude mice. Images taken of these vascular casts showed Caki-1 tumors to be highly vascularized and invasive. The spread of the tumor within the cortex of the kidney revealed that Caki-1 recruits the kidney's own vasculature, destroying the functional glomeruli in the process. The loss of these glomeruli was further highlighted by the presence of enlarged glomeruli resulting from the development of super nephrons. Vessel size and density measurements were then made in this model. This was done using both computer-based and manual measurement methods. In the vessel size studies the computer-based method tended to overestimate the number of larger diameter vessels whereas the vessels density assessment showed good agreement between the two techniques. Nevertheless, both methods showed that Caki-1 tumors possessed a higher proportion of larger diameter vessels and a lower vessel density than normal kidney cortex. In summary, silicon based vascular casting proved to be a simple and effective tool for the study of tumor vasculature. In particular this technique could readily be used to examine the invasion of tumor into normal tissue. The computer-based technique for evaluating vessel number and vascular density was found to have merit in both normal and tumor tissues, particularly in the vascular density studies.

Thermic stability and biocompatibility of HE-24.8 were assessed in vitro and by analyzing kinetics and organ distribution in rats for up to 2 weeks. For comparison, HE-24.8- and Gd-DTPA-HSA-enhanced micro-MR angiographies of brain, chest, and subcutaneous tumors in rats were performed. T1 relaxivity of HE-24.8 (21.3 +/- 1.1 mM(-1) s(-1)) was 5-fold higher than that of Gd-DTPA-BMA (4.1 +/- 0.1 mM(-1) s(-1)) and twice as high as that of Gd-DTPA-HSA (12.4 +/- 0.2 mM(-1) s(-1)). Varying the molecular weight of the polymer (15-46 kDa) did not significantly change the T1 relaxivity. In rats, 20 and 10% of the injected dose of HE-24.8 was detected at 24 and 168 h postinjection, respectively.

However, the literature addressing the biology of the interembryonic regions of the uterus is very limited, presumably because it has been assumed that this area has little role in the development and support of embryos in viviparous squamates. This study was undertaken to examine the histology of the interembryonic regions of Mabuya brachypoda, a viviparous lizard with microlecithal ova and consequently substantial matrotrophic activity. The incubation chambers are oval, distended zones of the uterus, adjacent to the interembryonic regions. The wall of the interembryonic regions includes: mucosa, formed by a cuboidal or columnar epithelium with ciliated and nonciliated cells, and a lamina propria of vascularized connective tissue containing abundant acinar glands; myometrial smooth muscle consisting of inner circular and outer longitudinal layers; and serosa. The segment of the interembryonic region adjacent to the incubation chamber forms a transitional segment that displays folds of the mucosa that protrude into the uterine lumen. The limit of the incubation chamber is well defined by the long mucosal folds of the transitional segment. Long and thin extensions of extraembryonic membranes are present in the lumen of the transitional segment, outside of the incubation chamber region. The presence of abundant uterine glands and extraembryonic membranes in the interembryonic regions during gestation suggests uterine secretory activity and histotrophic transfer of nutrients to embryos in these regions.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2006-01-18", "authors": ["Mari CarmenUribe-Aranz\u00e1bal", "ArletteHern\u00e1ndez-Franyutti", "Louis JGuillette"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.10416"}

Previously, we described that membrane type-3 metalloproteinase (MT3-MMP) is associated with endometrial angiogenesis in vitro. The association of MT-MMPs with endometrial angiogenesis in vivo is unknown. Therefore, this study analysed the presence of MT-MMPs in human endometrium and their correlation with neovascularization. RNA/protein expressions of the six MT-MMPs were determined in cultured endometrial cells. Vascularization parameters and MT-MMP expressions in vivo were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in serial endometrium sections. MT1-, MT2-, MT3- and MT4-MMP antigens were expressed in cultured endometrial endothelial cells. MT2-, MT3- and MT4-MMP were expressed by endothelium during the proliferative and secretory phase. Strikingly, these phases showed elevated vascularization, elevated total vascular surface in proliferative phases, elevated number of vessels in proliferative/late secretory phases and increased luminal surface in the proliferative phases. All MT-MMP antigens were expressed in various endometrial cell types in vivo, with decreased levels during the early secretory phase. In conclusion, all MT-MMPs are expressed in endometrium in a cycle-dependent pattern. The vascular expression of MT2-, MT3- and MT4-MMP correlated with angiogenic episodes of the cycle. Since MT2- and MT3-MMP are known to regulate tube formation, these findings support earlier in vitro data on the role of MT3-MMP in endometrial angiogenesis.

In a modified prone position, the rectourethral fistula was repaired using the transrectal transsphincteric (York-Mason) technique and the posterior urethral stricture with a radial forearm fasciocutaneous free flap which was anastomosed to the inferior gluteal artery and vein. The coexistence of a rectourethral fistula and distal urethral stricture requires simultaneous repair, because the urethral pressure from the distal obstruction may compromise fistula closure. Reconstructive efforts should be tailored to minimize disruption of the urethral blood supply in patients with previous pelvic trauma. Rectal and urethral repairs should be separated by well-vascularized tissue to prevent fistula recurrence.\nThe radial fasciocutaneous flap may offer the reconstructive surgeon another surgical option for complex urethral stricture and rectourethral fistula reconstruction when the local blood supply is in question.

In situ RT-PCR clearly indicated the presence of VEGF-A mRNA-expressing cells in the pars tuberalis and in the pars distalis both at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) and in later developmental stages. The primary capillaries extended along the developing pars tuberalis, whereas the portal vessels penetrated into the pars distalis at E15.5 and subsequently expanded into the lobe to connect with the secondary capillary plexus, emerging in the pars distalis. At the same time, several VEGF-A-positive cells appeared in the pars distalis. These VEGF-A-positive cells were found to correspond to a portion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) cells by dual-staining for in situ RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, suggesting that some ACTH cells have the potential to produce VEGF-A. Thus, the present study suggests that VEGF-A is involved in the development of the primary capillaries and in the vascularization of the pars distalis, but not in the portal vessels since the formation of portal vessels begins at E13.5, before the appearance of VEGF-A in the rostral region of the pars distalis.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2006-01-18", "authors": ["TakashiNakakura", "MayumiYoshida", "HideoDohra", "MasakazuSuzuki", "ShigeyasuTanaka"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-005-0115-y"}

Recently, in vivo expression of saxatilin, a novel disintegrin purified from snake (Gloydius saxatilis) venom, was able to strongly inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and smooth muscle cell migration, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. However, the antitumor efficacy of the individual antiangiogenic molecules expressed in vivo was not sufficiently potent to induce tumor regression in animal models. Therefore, in this study, we have systemically examined how combinational transfer of angiostatin, endostatin, and saxatilin genes affects neovascularization in tumor tissues and tumor progression in a mouse model.

Compared with the empty vector-treated control group, cotreatment with the three plasmids reduced B16BL6 tumor growth by 89% and pulmonary metastasis by 90%.

{"title": "Mechanisms of pericyte recruitment in tumour angiogenesis: a new role for metalloproteinases.", "abstract": "Pericytes occur in tumour blood vessels and are critical for the development of a functional vascular network. Targeting tumour pericytes is a promising anti-angiogenic therapy but requires identifying the mechanisms of their recruitment in tumour and addressing whether these mechanisms can be selectively harnessed. Among the pathways involved in pericyte recruitment during embryonic development, the contribution of platelet-derived growth factor B and sphingosine 1-phosphate is confirmed in tumour angiogenesis. The effect of angiopoietin 1 depends on the tumour model. Transforming growth factor-beta1 enhances tumour vascularization and microvessel maturation. Recent reports suggest a participation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in tumour pericyte recruitment that is consistent with the effect of certain MMPs in the development of microvasculature in embryonic development and in in vitro models of vascular remodelling. Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: (1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; (2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; (3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; (4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; (5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and (6) recruitment of bone marrow-derived stem cells.", "journal": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "date": "2006-01-13", "authors": ["Christophe FChantrain", "PatrickHenriet", "SonataJodele", "Herv\u00e9Emonard", "OlivierFeron", "Pierre JCourtoy", "Yves ADeClerck", "EtienneMarbaix"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2005.11.010"}
{"title": "Vascularized tissue-engineered ears.", "abstract": "A paucity of appropriate regional and local matching tissue can compromise the reconstruction efforts in areas of the body that require specialized tissue. The current study uses techniques of vascular prefabrication, tissue culturing, and capsule formation to form a vascularized ear construct that is reliably transferable on its blood supply.\nThirty male Wistar rats (250 to 350 g) were anaesthetized. An incision was made over the right lower abdominal wall. A pocket was formed by blunt dissection just below the panniculus carnosus. A separate incision was made over the right femoral vessels, which were then isolated and transected distally. The vessels were transposed in a subcutaneous plane to the abdominal wound. A silicone mold in the shape of an ear (2 x 1.5 cm) was placed over the transposed vessels in the abdominal wound pocket. The wounds were closed. Auricular cartilage was minced, washed, and cultured. After 14 days, the chondrocyte culturing was complete and a vascularized capsule based on the incorporated, transposed femoral vessels was formed. The abdominal incision was then reopened, an incision was made in the lateral capsule, and the cultured chondrocytes were introduced into the molded capsule. Study groups included capsules filled with chondrocytes only, chondrocytes and a fibrin glue carrier, and the fibrin glue only. The capsule was closed and the wounds sutured. The prefabricated, prelaminated construct was isolated on its vascular pedicle 14 days later and traversed microsurgically to the contralateral leg vessels. Histologic analysis was performed.\nAll 30 capsules were completely vascularized and could be reliably isolated and transferred microsurgically on the transposed femoral vessels. The pedicle, being incorporated directly into the capsule, provided the dominant blood supply to the construct. None of the capsules with the fibrin glue only retained any shape and all were devoid of cartilage. Similarly, there was no evidence of retained cartilage in the capsules filled with chondrocytes alone. All capsules with the chondrocytes and the fibrin carrier had mature shaped cartilage preserved. External molds were required to maintain the shape of the ear. Extrusion, although almost uniform in the group with external molds, did not interfere with the end construct shape or vascularity. When molds were used, four of six had excellent maintenances of shape and two of six had only minor superior pole deformation. All constructs were reliably transferred as free flaps.\nThe authors have shown that transposing a vascular pedicle to a subcutaneously placed silicone block will result in a vascular capsule that can be mobilized and transferred based solely on the pedicle. Although the capsule provides vascularity to the chondrocytes, the cultured cartilage will fill the shape of the silicone mold only if an appropriate carrier such as fibrin glue is used and an external mold is applied.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2006-01-13", "authors": ["Michael WNeumeister", "TammyWu", "ChristopherChambers"], "doi": "10.1097/01.prs.0000195071.01699.ce"}

The lesions behave like a slow-growing liver cancer, without sharp limits between the parasitic tissue and the liver parenchyma. Invasion of biliary and vascular walls is another hallmark of this severe disease. Moreover, the poor vascularization of the parasitic mass often leads to necrosis in the central part of the lesion. This explains why liver abscess due to superimposed bacterial infection of the necrotic area may occur in this disease. Currently, a range of imaging techniques can be used at the different stages of management of AE. For diagnosis, ultrasonography remains the first line examination. For a more accurate disease evaluation, aiming to guide the surgical strategy, computerized tomography, Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, including cholangio-MR imaging are of importance, providing useful complementary information. More recently, Positive-Emission Tomography using [18F] fluoro-deoxyglucose has been developed for the follow-up of inoperable AE patients under long-term benzimidazoles therapy. This approach seems very promising to assess inflammatory activity and thereby to indirectly depict parasitic activity. Non-surgical interventional procedures, mainly percutaneous biliary and/or centro-parasitic abscesses drainages, are currently a major aspect in the care of incurable AE patients and have largely contributed to the improvement of survival in this situation during the past 20 years. They may also be used as a bridge before a curative surgical procedure in symptomatic patients presenting a life-threatening bacterial and/or fungal infection.

The biological effects underlying GM-CSF action in impaired wound healing have been only partly clarified. Objectives To investigate the effects of GM-CSF treatment of chronic venous ulcers on lesion vascularization and on the local synthesis of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PlGF). Methods Patients with nonhealing venous leg ulcers were treated with intradermal injection of recombinant human GM-CSF, and biopsies were taken at the ulcer margin before and 5 days after administration. Wound vascularization was analysed by immunohistochemistry using antiplatelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1/CD31 and anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies. VEGF and PlGF transcription was assessed by in situ hybridization. To identify the cell populations transcribing VEGF within the ulcer bed, the VEGF hybridization signal was correlated with the immunostaining for different cell type markers on serial sections. Direct induction of VEGF transcription by GM-CSF was investigated in GM-CSF-treated cultured macrophages and keratinocytes. Results Blood vessel density was significantly increased in the ulcer bed following GM-CSF treatment. VEGF transcripts were localized in keratinocytes at the ulcer margin both before and after GM-CSF treatment, whereas a VEGF hybridization signal was evident within the ulcer bed only following administration. PlGF mRNA was barely detectable in keratinocytes at the ulcer margin and was not visibly increased after treatment. Unlike VEGF, a specific PlGF hybridization signal could not be detected in cells within the ulcer following GM-CSF administration. Monocytes/macrophages were the main cell population transcribing VEGF after GM-CSF treatment. In vitro analysis demonstrated that VEGF transcription can be directly stimulated by GM-CSF in a differentiated monocytic cell line, but not in keratinocytes.

Recent studies showed that FTY-P affects vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced vascular permeability, an important aspect of angiogenesis. We show here that FTY720 has antiangiogenic activity, potently abrogating VEGF- and S1P-induced angiogenesis in vivo in growth factor implant and corneal models. FTY720 administration tended to inhibit primary and significantly inhibited metastatic tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma growth. In combination with a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584, FTY720 showed some additional benefit. FTY720 markedly inhibited tumor-associated angiogenesis, and this was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In transfected HEK293 cells, FTY-P internalized S1P1 receptors, inhibited their recycling to the cell surface, and desensitized S1P receptor function. Both FTY720 and FTY-P apparently failed to impede VEGF-produced increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), and unlike its activity in causing S1PR internalization, FTY-P did not result in a decrease of surface VEGFR2 levels in HUVEC cells. Pretreatment with FTY720 or FTY-P prevented S1P-induced Ca2+ mobilization and migration in vascular endothelial cells. These data show that functional antagonism of vascular S1P receptors by FTY720 potently inhibits angiogenesis; therefore, this may provide a novel therapeutic approach for pathologic conditions with dysregulated angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2006-01-07", "authors": ["KennethLaMontagne", "AmandaLittlewood-Evans", "ChristianSchnell", "TerenceO'Reilly", "LorenzaWyder", "TeresaSanchez", "BeatriceProbst", "JeanneneButler", "AlexanderWood", "GeneLiau", "EricBilly", "AndreasTheuer", "TimothyHla", "JeanetteWood"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2001"}
{"title": "Molecular fingerprinting and autocrine growth regulation of endothelial cells in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "In a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinogenesis, highly vascularized tumors develop through two distinct morphologic phases of neovascularization. We show that increased vascular caliber occurs first, followed by extensive vessel sprouting in late-stage carcinomas. To define molecular pathways in tumor neovascularization, endothelial cells were directly purified from normal liver and advanced tumors. Gene expression profiling experiments were then designed to identify genes enriched in the vascular compartment. We report that Cathepsin S is the major protease specifically overexpressed during vessel sprouting. We also show that the CC chemokines CCL2 and CCL3 are secreted by neovessels and stimulate proliferation through their cognate receptors in an autocrine fashion. This suggests that chemokine signaling represents the most prominent signaling pathway in tumor-associated endothelial cells and directly regulates vessel remodeling. Furthermore, high angiogenic activity is associated with attenuated lymphocyte extravasation and correlates with expression of the immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin 10. This is the first comprehensive study addressing liver-specific vascular changes in a murine autochthonous tumor model. These novel insights into liver angiogenesis infer an environmental control of neovascularization and have important implications for the design of antiangiogenic therapies.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2006-01-07", "authors": ["EduardRyschich", "PauliusLizdenis", "CarinaIttrich", "AxelBenner", "SimoneStahl", "AlfHamann", "JanSchmidt", "PercyKnolle", "BerndArnold", "G\u00fcnter JH\u00e4mmerling", "RuthGanss"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1636"}
{"title": "The Cdx4 mutation affects axial development and reveals an essential role of Cdx genes in the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth in mice.", "abstract": "Caudal related homeobox (Cdx) genes have so far been shown to be important for embryonic axial elongation and patterning in several vertebrate species. We have generated a targeted mutation of mouse Cdx4, the third member of this family of transcription factor encoding genes and the last one to be inactivated genetically. Cdx4-null embryos were born healthy and appeared morphologically normal. A subtle contribution of Cdx4 to anteroposterior (AP) vertebral patterning was revealed in Cdx1/Cdx4 and Cdx2/Cdx4 compound mutants. Neither Cdx4-null nor Cdx1/Cdx4 double mutants are impaired in their axial elongation, but a redundant contribution of Cdx4 in this function was unveiled when combined with a Cdx2 mutant allele. In addition, inactivation of Cdx4 combined with heterozygous loss of Cdx2 results in embryonic death around E10.5 and reveals a novel function of Cdx genes in placental ontogenesis. In a subset of Cdx2/Cdx4 compound mutants, the fully grown allantois failed to fuse with the chorion. The remaining majority of these mutants undergo successful chorio-allantois fusion but fail to properly extend their allantoic vascular network into the chorionic ectoderm and do not develop a functional placental labyrinth. We present evidence that Cdx4 plays a crucial role in the ontogenesis of the allantoic component of the placental labyrinth when one Cdx2 allele is inactivated. The axial patterning role of Cdx transcription factors thus extends posteriorly to the epiblast-derived extra-embryonic mesoderm and, consequent upon the evolution of placental mammals, is centrally involved in placental morphogenesis. The relative contribution of Cdx family members in the stepwise ontogenesis of a functional placenta is discussed, with Cdx2 playing an obligatory part, assisted by Cdx4. The possible participation of Cdx1 was not documented but cannot be ruled out until allelic combinations further decreasing Cdx dose have been analyzed. Cdx genes thus operate in a redundant way during placentogenesis, as they do during embryonic axial elongation and patterning, and independently from the previously reported early Cdx2-specific role in the trophectoderm at implantation.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2006-01-07", "authors": ["Johanvan Nes", "Wimde Graaff", "FranckLebrin", "MarkusGerhard", "FelixBeck", "JacquelineDeschamps"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.02216"}

Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were determined by the shortened latency of foot withdrawal to radiant heat and von Frey filament stimulation to the hind paw, respectively. Intracellular recordings were obtained in vitro from L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) somata. DRG inflammation was examined by observation of the appearance and hematoxylin and eosin staining. ASMT was applied to the spinous process of L4, L5, and L6. A series of 10 adjustments were initiated 24 hours after surgery and subsequently applied daily for 7 consecutive days and every other day during the second week.\n(1) ASMT applied on L5, L6, or L5 and L6 spinous process significantly reduced the severity and duration of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia produced by the IVF inflammation. However, ASMT applied on L4 did not affect the response in rats with IVF inflammation or the controls; (2) electrophysiological studies showed that hyperexcitability of the DRG neurons produced by IVF inflammation was significantly reduced by ASMT; (3) pathological studies showed that manifestations of the DRG inflammation, such as the increased vascularization and satellitosis, were significantly reduced 2 to 3 weeks after ASMT.\nThese studies show that ASMT can significantly reduce the severity and shorten the duration of pain and hyperalgesia caused by lumbar IVF inflammation.

We have recently shown that human monocytes infiltrate vascularized allografts before clinical rejection and have thus hypothesized that monocytes, rather than costimulation-poor ECs, initiate an alloimmune response. However, the nature of the interactions between ECs, monocytes, and T cells has been incompletely defined. Specifically, it is not clear whether these cells interact in a hierarchical manner, nor is it apparent what constitutes an interaction. We therefore studied human ECs, monocytes, and T cells in various isolated in vitro combinations to define the salient features of their contact and to determine whether their interactions were sequential in nature. We find that T cells proliferate poorly to allogeneic ECs and autologous monocytes but well to autologous monocytes following allogeneic EC contact. We show that monocytes gain their stimulatory capacity by phagocytizing allogeneic but not autologous EC membranes in a process governed by scavenger receptors. This process facilitates the subsequent presentation of intact donor HLA molecules to T cells (semidirect presentation). Moreover, monocytes are receptive to T cell help only after exposure to ECs and require CD4+ T cells to optimally express costimulatory molecules and foster Ag presentation. Our results indicate that monocytes engage allogeneic ECs through scavenger receptors and are then primed to facilitate T cell activation in a codependent manner.

Oxygen transport was simulated for a three-dimensional vascular network using parameters for rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle when oxygen consumption by tissue reached 6, 12, and 18 times basal consumption. First, a control network was generated by using straight non-anastomosed capillaries to establish baseline capillarity. Two networks were then constructed simulating either abluminal lateral sprouting or intraluminal splitting angiogenesis such that capillary surface area was equal in both networks. The sprouting network was constructed by placing anastomosed capillaries between straight capillaries of the control network with a higher probability of placement near hypoxic tissue. The splitting network was constructed by splitting capillaries from the control network into two branches at randomly chosen branching points. Under conditions of moderate oxygen consumption (6 times basal), only minor differences in oxygen delivery resulted between the sprouting and splitting networks. At higher consumption levels (12 and 18 times basal), the splitting network had the lowest volume of hypoxic tissue of the three networks.

This defect is associated, in some but not all patients, with a cell surface activity of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an enzyme that inactivates SDF-1. Diabetic CD34+ cells also do not migrate in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and are structurally rigid. However, incubating CD34+ cells with a nitric oxide (NO) donor corrects this migration defect and corrects the cell deformability. In addition, exogenous NO alters vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and mammalian-enabled distribution in EPCs. These data support a common downstream cytoskeletal alteration in diabetic CD34+ cells that is independent of growth factor receptor activation and is correctable with exogenous NO. This inability of diabetic EPCs to respond to SDF-1 may contribute to aberrant tissue vascularization and endothelial repair in diabetic patients.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2005-12-29", "authors": ["Mark SSegal", "RonakShah", "AqeelaAfzal", "Cecile MPerrault", "KyungheeChang", "AnnaSchuler", "ElaineBeem", "Lynn CShaw", "SergioLi Calzi", "Jeffrey KHarrison", "RogerTran-Son-Tay", "Maria BGrant"], "doi": null}

The activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are important effectors of innate immunity and regulators of adaptive immunity, is controlled primarily by receptors that are at the cell surface. Here we show that cytokine secretion by resting human NK cells is induced by soluble, but not solid-phase, antibodies to the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DL4, a receptor for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G. KIR2DL4 was constitutively internalized into Rab5-positive compartments via a dynamin-dependent process. Soluble HLA-G was endocytosed into KIR2DL4-containing compartments in NK cells and in 293T cells transfected with KIR2DL4. Chemokine secretion induced by KIR2DL4 transfection into 293T cells occurred only with recombinant forms of KIR2DL4 that trafficked to endosomes. The profile of genes up-regulated by KIR2DL4 engagement on resting NK cells revealed a proinflammatory/proangiogenic response. Soluble HLA-G induced secretion of a similar set of cytokines and chemokines. This unique stimulation of resting NK cells by soluble HLA-G, which is endocytosed by KIR2DL4, implies that NK cells may provide useful functions at sites of HLA-G expression, such as promotion of vascularization in maternal decidua during early pregnancy.", "journal": "PLoS biology", "date": "2005-12-22", "authors": ["SumatiRajagopalan", "Yenan TBryceson", "Shanmuga PKuppusamy", "Daniel EGeraghty", "Arnoldvan der Meer", "IrmaJoosten", "Eric OLong"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.0040009"}

VEGF(165) signaling through VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) is a highly regulated process involving the formation of a tertiary complex with glypican (GYP)-1 and neuropilin (NRP)-1. Both VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression are reduced in emphysematous lungs; however, the mechanism of regulation of VEGF(165) signaling through the VEGFR-2 complex in response to cigarette smoke exposure in vivo, and in smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is still unknown. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke exposure disrupts the VEGF(165)-VEGFR-2 complex, a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of emphysema. We show that cigarette smoke exposure reduces NRP-1 and GYP-1 as well as VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels in rat lungs and that VEGF, VEGFR-2, GYP-1, and NRP-1 expression in the lungs of both smokers and patients with COPD are also reduced compared with nonsmokers. Moreover, our data suggest that specific inhibition of VEGFR-2 alone with NVP-AAD777 would appear not to result in emphysema in the adult rat lung. As both VEGF(165) and VEGFR-2 expression are reduced in emphysematous lungs, decreased GYP-1 and NRP-1 expression may yet further disrupt VEGF(165)-VEGFR-2 signaling. Whether or not this by itself is critical for inducing endothelial cell apoptosis and decreased vascularization of the lung seen in emphysema patients is still unclear at present.

The patients recovered, but the posttransplant patient had recurrent membranous obstructions with multiple interventions. The cause and triggers of the process are unknown. Based on repeated observations of the evolution of the membranes, and histologic material from bronchoscopies, we propose a putative paradigm of the natural history of the process. We suggest that local stimuli generate a richly vascularized granulation polyp, which progresses in a \"shutter-like\" motion to form partial or completely obstructive membranes.

HET0016 inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced proliferation and diminished phosphorylation of PDGF receptors.

We show that pharmacological inhibition of the Shh signaling pathway significantly reduces physiological retinal angiogenesis and inhibits pathological vascularization in both models. Under retinal hypoxic conditions, inhibition of the Shh pathway results in reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level, along with that of Patched-1 (Ptch1), a canonical Shh target, thus placing Shh activation upstream of VEGF in experimental retinal neovascularization. Our data demonstrate the requirement of the Shh pathway for retinal angiogenesis and its inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy targeting ocular neovascular disease.", "journal": "Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "date": "2005-12-14", "authors": ["Enrico MSurace", "Kamaljit SBalaggan", "AlessandraTessitore", "ClaudioMussolino", "GabriellaCotugno", "CiroBonetti", "AnielloVitale", "Robin RAli", "AlbertoAuricchio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.10.010"}

Given the documented role of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 and its ligand ephrin-B2 in the establishment of the embryonal vascular network, we hypothesized that these molecules are also instrumental in the development of the human placenta. Monitoring the expression during placental development revealed that in first trimester and term placentae both molecules are equally expressed at the RNA level. In contrast, the protein levels were significantly reduced during gestation. Immunohistochemistry revealed a distinct localization of the EphB4 and ephrin-B2 proteins. EphB4 was predominantly expressed in the villous syncytial trophoblast layer and in a subset of intravillous capillaries. Prominent expression was also observed in the extravillous cytotrophoblast giant cells. In contrast, ephrin-B2 expression was detected in the villous cytotrophoblast and syncytial trophoblast cell layers, as well as initially in all intravillous capillaries. Strong expression was also observed in extravillous anchoring cytotrophoblast cells. Hypoxia is a major inducer of placental development. In vitro studies employing trophoblast-derived cell lines revealed that predominantly ephrin-B2 expression is induced by hypoxia, however, in an Hif-1alpha independent manner. These experiments suggest that EphB4 and ephrin-B2 are instrumental in the establishment of a functional placental structure and of the utero-placental circulation.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2005-12-14", "authors": ["C SChennakesava", "SDi Santo", "AZiemiecki", "HSchneider", "A-CAndres"], "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2005.10.008"}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a predominant role in the increased vascularity and endothelial cell proliferation in GBMs driven by the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines. In this study, we employed a vector-encoded VEGF siRNA to impair VEGF secretion from U87 human glioblastoma cells. The direct intra-tumor injection of a siRNA-encoding plasmid complexed with linear polyethylenimine (PEI) efficiently reduced the vascularization of treated tumors in xenografts established in SCID mice by subcutaneous inoculation of U87 cells, but was not able to reduce tumor growth. We then sought to strengthen the in vivo action of our siRNA by coupling it to a well known direct antiangiogenic agent, mouse interleukin 4 (mIL4). We infected U87 cells with a retroviral vector coexpressing the VEGF siRNA and mIL4 and produced stable cell lines that we used for an in vivo experiment of subcutaneous injection in SCID mice. In this setting, the concomitant expression of mIL4 and siRNA totally abolished the growth of subcutaneous tumors.

To identify the contribution of the different vascular compartments in the diabetic impairment of vascularization, we employed streptozotocin- and control-treated 3-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice in an isogeneic pinnal cardiac allograft model, revealing a significant delay in vascularization of wild-type cardiac tissue transplanted into diabetic mice. To investigate the basis of this impairment, the function of diabetic bone marrow cells was tested by transplantation of bone marrow cells isolated from diabetic and control mice into intact, unirradiated 18-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice, which have impaired function of both EPCs and peripheral endothelial cells. Importantly, cells derived from control, but not diabetic, bone marrow integrated into transplanted cardiac allografts. To assess the contribution of diabetic changes in the local vasculature, diabetic mice were treated with pinnal injections of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB, which promotes cardiac angiogenesis in wild-type mice. However, whereas PDGF-AB enhanced allograft function in control mice, the activity of the cardiac transplants in the PDGF-AB-treated diabetic mice was significantly decreased. To decipher the potential interactions between systemic bone marrow-derived cells and local vascular pathways, diabetic mice were transplanted with wild-type bone marrow cells with or without PDGF-AB pinnal pretreatment, resulting in improved allograft function and donor cell recruitment only in the combination treatment arm.

The microgranules have the flexibility to fill various types of defect sites with closer packing. The interconnected pores formed spaces between the microgranules, which allowed new bone ingrowth and vascularization. In addition, the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) was incorporated into the microgranules in order to improve bone-healing efficacy. The collagen/chitosan microgranules were fabricated by dropping a mixed solution into a NaOH/ethanol solution. TGF-beta1 was loaded into the collagen/chitosan microgranules by soaking the microgranules in a TGF-beta1 solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and experiments examining the release of TGF-beta1 from chitosan and the collagen/chitosan microgranules were performed. SEM was used to examine the cell morphologies on the microgranules and cell proliferation was evaluated using a dimethylthiazole tetrazolium bromide assay. The differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity as well as detecting an osteocalcin assay. The in vivo bone-regeneration experiments were performed using a rabbit calvarial defect model. TGF-beta1 was released from the collagen/chitosan microgranules at a therapeutic concentration for 4 weeks. SEM indicated that the seeded osteoblastic cells were firmly attached to the microgranules and proliferated in a multilayer manner. The proliferation of the osteoblasts on the TGF-beta1-loaded microgranules was the highest among the different types of microgranules tested. The ALPase activity and osteocalcin level of all the samples increased during the culture period, and the TGF-beta1-loaded microgranules had a significantly higher ALPase activity and osteocalcin content than the other microgranules.

However, whether other angiogenic cytokines are also differentially expressed in these glioblastoma subtypes is not known so far, but this knowledge might be important to optimize an antiangiogenic therapy. Therefore, we studied the expression of several angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF-A, HGF, bFGF, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, G-CSF and GM-CSF in pGBMs and sGBMs as well as in gliomas WHO III, the precursor lesions of sGBMs. In tumor tissues, expression of all cytokines was observed albeit with marked differences concerning intensity and distribution pattern. Quantification of the cytokines in the supernatant of 30 tissue-corresponding glioma cultures revealed a predominant expression of VEGF-A in pGBMs and significantly higher expression levels of PDGF-AB in sGBMs. HGF and bFGF were determined in nearly all tumor cultures but with no GBM subtype or malignancy-related differences. Interestingly, GM-CSF and especially G-CSF were produced less frequently by tumor cells. However, GM-CSF secretion occurred together with an increased number of simultaneously secreted cytokines and correlated with a worse patient prognosis and may thus represent a more aggressive angiogenic phenotype. Finally, we confirmed an independent contribution of each tumor-derived cytokine analyzed to tumor-induced vascularization.

Like the human pancreas, the canine pancreas is compact, with similar vascularization and lobular structure. It is therefore a suitable model in which to assess gene transfer strategies. Here we examined the ability of adenoviral vectors to transfer genes into the pancreas of dogs in which pancreatic circulation had been clamped. Adenoviruses carrying the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene were injected into the pancreatic-duodenal vein and the clamp was released 10 min later. These dogs showed beta-gal-positive cells throughout the pancreas, with no evidence of pancreatic damage. beta-Gal was expressed mainly in acinar cells, but also in ducts and islets. Moreover, transduction was prominent in connective tissue of the lobe septa. beta-Gal expression in the exocrine pancreas of a diabetic dog was also found to be similar to that observed in healthy dogs. Thus, efficient gene transfer to canine pancreas in vivo may be achieved by adenovirus injection after clamping pancreatic circulation.

Three examiners assessed different parameters of the transplant organ (max. vascularized area, suspected hematomas, tumors, rejection, acute tubular necrosis). Findings were confirmed by histological results of a biopsy if rejection, tumor, or acute tubular necrosis were suspected. Application of ultrasound contrast medium significantly increased visualization of the vascularized kidney area. Also, US findings in the follow-up after acute rejection therapy corresponded with the clinical course; 19 hematomas could be detected with contrast medium compared to only 9 without. With contrast medium a perfusion deficit was detectable in three patients compared to one patient with power Doppler US. Also, US contrast medium helped to detect tumor vascularization in two patients in whom conventional sonography suspected no abnormality.

{"title": "Integrins and angiogenesis: a sticky business.", "abstract": "From an evolutionary point of view, the development of a cardiovascular system allowed vertebrates to nourish the several organs that compose their wider multicellular organism and to survive. Acquisition of new genes encoding for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and their cognate integrin receptors as well as secreted pro- and anti-angiogenic factors proved to be essential for the development of vascular networks in the vertebrate embryo. Postnatal tissue neo-vascularization plays a key role during wound healing and pathological angiogenesis as well. There is now clear evidence that building blood vessels in the embryo and in the adult organism relies upon different endothelial integrins and ECM ligands. A successful vascular development depends on fibronectin and its major receptor alpha5beta1 integrin, but not on alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, and alpha6beta4 integrins that are instead central regulators of postnatal tumor angiogenesis. Here, endothelial alphavbeta3 elicits anti- or pro-angiogenic signals depending respectively on whether it is occupied by a soluble (e.g. type IV collagen derived tumstatin) or an insoluble (vitronectin) ECM ligand. The laminin-5 receptor alpha6beta4 integrin, expressed only by endothelial cells of mature blood vessels, controls the invasive phase of tumor angiogenesis in the adult organism. Finally, regulation of vascular morphogenesis relies upon the fine modulation of integrin activation by chemoattractant and chemorepulsive cues, such as angiogenic growth factors and semaphorins.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2005-12-06", "authors": ["GuidoSerini", "DonatellaValdembri", "FedericoBussolino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.020"}

In the first stages of vasculogenesis, endothelial cells elongate and form a network-like structure, called the primary capillary plexus, which subsequently remodels, with the size of the vacancies between ribbons of endothelial cells coarsening over time. To isolate such intrinsic morphogenetic ability of endothelial cells from its regulation by long-range guidance cues and additional cell types, we use an in vitro model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in Matrigel. This quasi-two-dimensional endothelial cell culture model would most closely correspond to vasculogenesis in flat areas of the embryo like the yolk sac. Several studies have used continuum mathematical models to explore in vitro vasculogenesis: such models describe cell ensembles but ignore the endothelial cells' shapes and active surface fluctuations. While these models initially reproduce vascular-like morphologies, they eventually stabilize into a disconnected pattern of vascular \"islands.\" Also, they fail to reproduce temporally correct network coarsening. Using a cell-centered computational model, we show that the endothelial cells' elongated shape is key to correct spatiotemporal in silico replication of stable vascular network growth.

In this study, we investigated the role of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling in the PH of Denver FHR. In alpha-toxin permeabilized pulmonary arteries from Denver FHR, the contractile sensitivity to Ca2+ was increased compared with those from sea-level FHR. RhoA activity and Rho kinase I protein expression in pulmonary arteries of Denver FHR (10-wk-old) were higher than in those of sea-level FHR. Acute inhalation of the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil selectively reduced the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in Denver FHR in vivo. Chronic fasudil treatment (30 mg.kg-1.day-1, from birth to 10 wk old) markedly reduced the development of PH and improved lung alveolarization and vascularization in Denver FHR.

Six objective responses were observed in three renal cell carcinomas, one neuroendocrine tumor, one stromal tumor, and one unknown primary adenocarcinoma patient. At higher doses (> or = 75 mg/d), tumor responses were often associated with reduced intratumoral vascularization and central tumor necrosis, eventually resulting in organ perforation or fistula.\nAt the dose of 50 mg/d (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off), sunitinib displays manageable toxicity.

Evidence-based data for a standardized therapy is lacking.\nA 32-year-old obese nulligravida presented with persistent vaginal bleeding after the operation of an acute adnextorsion at another hospital. The repeat gynecological ultrasound examination showed a 5.3x5.3x3.6 cm vascularized, partially inhomogeneous mass in the uterus. A fractioned curettage yielded a differential diagnosis of malignant muellerian mixed tumor or a non-differentiated endometrial sarcoma. For completion of the operative treatment, laparotomy with hysterectomy, adnexectomy, and pelvine lymphonodectomy were performed. The final histological report described a 7 cm non-differentiated endometrial sarcoma with infiltration of the left ovary and 25 tumor-free lymph nodes.\nStandard therapy for resectable sarcoma is abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. So far, there is little data from studies reporting radio- or chemotherapy treatment of small patient numbers in an adjuvant setting.\nThe ESS is a very rare disease of the uterus.

Cigarette smoke appears to have adverse effects along a continuum of reproductive processes. We therefore studied the effect of nicotine on follicular growth and vascularization of freely transplanted ovarian follicles.\nWe used the skinfold chamber model in Syrian golden hamsters, which allows the in vivo microscopy of follicular grafts. Animals were treated daily with nicotine at doses mimicking low-rate and high-rate smokers (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously). Saline-treated animals served as controls. To further evaluate the effect of nicotine on angiogenesis, an in vitro aortic ring assay was used.\nThe re-vascularisation rate of follicles was similar in nicotine-treated animals and controls. During the 7 days after transplantation, nicotine further caused a dose-dependent inhibition of follicular growth. In contrast, the vascularized area and microvessel density were not affected by the nicotine exposure. In vitro aortic ring assays confirmed that nicotine does not influence sprouting and microvessel formation. However, immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 revealed a large extent of granulosa cell apoptosis within transplanted follicles of high-dose nicotine-treated animals.\nNicotine as one toxic component of cigarette smoke does not affect vascularization, but adversely influences follicular growth by an increase in apoptotic cell death. As follicular growth is a crucial step in normal ovulation and fertilization, nicotine-induced cell apoptosis may represent one of the mechanisms underlying the well-established link between smoking and fertility disorders.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2005-11-29", "authors": ["RBordel", "M WLaschke", "M DMenger", "BVollmar"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/dei393"}

High numbers of neutrophils accumulated around the Col-I fibers and degradation of Col-I fibers into small fragments was observed on day 14. Active MMP-8 co-localized with the neutrophils on day 14, indicating enzymatic degradation of Col-I by neutrophil collagenase. Highly vascularized extracellular matrix remained at day 70. No differences were observed in the FBR to Col-I after application on healthy or injured myocardium. The FBR had no adverse effects on the adjacent myocardial tissue.

{"title": "VEGF-A, cytoskeletal dynamics, and the pathological vascular phenotype.", "abstract": "Normal angiogenesis is a complex process involving the organization of proliferating and migrating endothelial cells (ECs) into a well-ordered and highly functional vascular network. In contrast, pathological angiogenesis, which is a conspicuous feature of tumor growth, ischemic diseases, and chronic inflammation, is characterized by vessels with aberrant angioarchitecture and compromised barrier function. Herein we review the subject of pathological angiogenesis, particularly that driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), from a new perspective. We propose that the serious structural and functional anomalies associated with VEGF-A-elicited neovessels, reflect, at least in part, imbalances in the internal molecular cues that govern the ordered assembly of ECs into three dimensional vascular networks and preserve vessel barrier function. Adopting such a viewpoint widens the focus from solely on specific pro-angiogenic stimuli such as VEGF-A to include a key set of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules, the Rho GTPases, which are known to direct multiple aspects of vascular morphogenesis including EC motility, alignment, multi-cellular organization, as well as intercellular junction integrity. We offer this perspective to draw attention to the importance of endothelial cytoskeletal dynamics for proper neovascularization and to suggest new therapeutic strategies with the potential to improve the pathological vascular phenotype.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2005-11-29", "authors": ["Janice ANagy", "Donald RSenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.017"}

We hypothesized that placental explants from normal pregnancies, maintained in cultures of different oxygen, would liberate factors that could be measured in this system. We further tested the angiogenic potential of placentae from intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) pregnancies and the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade.\nPlacental villous explants were maintained in culture at 3% and 20% O2. The resultant media was added to HUVECs seeded on 80% Matrigel. Cells were incubated at 6% O2 in accordance with the natural placental environment. After 6 hours, cells were fixed and stained and the length and number of tubules measured by morphometric imaging. Finally, VEGF and soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR-1) were recorded in the explant conditioned media.\nWithin the angiogenic assay, recombinant human VEGF significantly enhanced tubule outgrowth (branching and elongation) and this effect was blocked with neutralising antibody. Compared to 20% O2, media of placental explants conditioned at 3% O2 significantly encouraged tubule length and numbers. Again this affect was ablated by VEGF blockade. In cases of IUGR, conditioned media at 3% O2 showed a significant reduction in tubule growth. This was paralleled by a decline in available VEGF brought about an exaggeration in liberated sVEGFR-1. Notably, venous cord serum from IUGR pregnancies showed a similar elevation in sVEGFR-1.\nUnder restricted oxygen, placental angiogenic potential is suppressed in IUGR pregnancies through the overproduction of placental sVEGFR-1.

We first consider the anatomy and vascularization of the basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal system, emphasizing its susceptibility to the effects of arterial hypertension, sustained hypoperfusion, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The impact of aging and consequences of disruption of the cholinergic system in cognition and in control of cerebral blood flow are further discussed.

{"title": "Changes in response to spinal cord injury with development: vascularization, hemorrhage and apoptosis.", "abstract": "Chick embryos are capable of functional spinal cord regeneration following crush injury until embryonic day 13. Developmental changes occurring thereafter result in failure to regenerate. Secondary injury mechanisms can result in apoptotic cell death and make a major contribution to cell loss after trauma. We report here that around embryonic day 13 there is a dramatic increase in blood vessel numbers in the spinal cord, and that the extent of hemorrhage in response to injury increases with developmental age. This is paralleled by increased apoptosis and subsequent cavitation in spinal cords injured at embryonic day 15 as compared with embryonic day 11. Following spinal cord injury at embryonic day 15, apoptotic cell death is extensive and spreads to the same extent as the hemorrhage. When hemorrhage is reduced by treatment with the hemostatic drug desmopressin the extent of apoptosis and cavity formation in spinal cords injured at embryonic day 15 decreases. Furthermore, manipulations of embryonic day 11 spinal cords that increase hemorrhage also increase apoptosis and result in cavitation in contrast to the effective repair typical of this stage. Altogether these results suggest that cavity formation occurring at developmental stages non-permissive for regeneration is largely due to changes in the extent of apoptosis that are related to vascularization and hemorrhage.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2005-11-18", "authors": ["KWhalley", "PO'Neill", "PFerretti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.07.064"}

Two groups of non-lactating dairy cows with early (n = 11) or late (n = 9) post-ovulatory progesterone rises were created by inducing luteolysis in the presence of either a large (> 10 mm) or small (< 10 mm) follicle, respectively. LH pulses were measured on days 4 (all cows) and 7 (n = 7, early; n = 5, late) (day 1= ovulation). The cows were slaughtered on day 5 (n = 4 each group) or 8 (n = 7, early; n = 5, late). Immunohistochemical analysis for endothelial cells (von Willebrand Factor, VWF), steroidogenic cells (3beta-HSD) and proliferation marker (Ki67) were performed. The basal progesterone production and LH responsiveness (0.001-100 ng/ml) of dispersed luteal cells was investigated. The luteal concentrations of FGF-2 and VEGF were measured by ELISA and RIA, respectively. There were no differences in LH pulse characteristics, area of VWF staining, proliferation index, steroidogenic cell characteristics, basal or LH-stimulated progesterone production by luteal cells between cows with an early or late progesterone rise (P > 0.10). However, the area of VWF staining increased from days 5 to 8, while the proliferation index decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the luteal cells were more responsive to LH on day 8 (P < 0.01). Luteal concentrations of FGF-2 were higher on day 5 (P = 0.05), while VEGF was greater on day 8 (P < 0.01).

The tracheal defect (55 mm x 30 mm) was located at the thoracic inlet adjacent to the major mediastinal vessels. Our reconstructive procedure was a two-staged surgery. In the first stage, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was transferred to the neck to provide a well-vascularized recipient bed for free costal cartilage grafts and to cover large vessels. Two pieces of free costal cartilage were grafted on the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, one for the lateral wall reconstruction and the other prefabricated for the anterior wall of the trachea. In the second stage, the re-vascularized cartilage graft for the anterior wall of the trachea with overlying skin was rotated onto the trough of the remaining trachea and the closure of the tracheal defect was completed.

In these PCOS patients who ovulated whilst under metformin treatment (PCOS group) and in controls, uterine, sub-endometrial and endometrial blood flow, and endometrial thickness and pattern were evaluated using serial ultrasonographic assessments.\nBefore treatment, uterine, sub-endometrial and endometrial blood flows were significantly lower in patients with PCOS than in the control group. All indexes of uterine vascularization were significantly improved in the PCOS group with metformin treatment and were not different from the controls. Nor was any difference in endometrial thickness and pattern detected between PCOS and control groups. After grouping the data of PCOS patients who ovulated under metformin for cycles with favourable/unfavourable reproductive outcome, no difference in any parameter was observed.\nMetformin improves all surrogate markers of endometrial receptivity in PCOS patients, without difference between patients who had favourable or unfavourable reproductive outcome.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2005-10-29", "authors": ["StefanoPalomba", "TizianaRusso", "FrancescoOrio", "AngelaFalbo", "FrancescoManguso", "TeresaCascella", "AchilleTolino", "EnricoCarmina", "AnnamariaColao", "FulvioZullo"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/dei351"}

The single most common benign ovarian neoplasm is the benign cystic teratoma; however, according to some studies it is serous cyst adenoma. A 36-year-old nonmarried virgin woman was referred to our clinic from a local medical center. When she was seen first at our outpatient clinic, she looked like a 9-month pregnant woman. Her medical history was normal. She had no serious illness or operation before. On abdominal ultrasound, a giant cyst was found which encompassed the whole abdomen. At laparotomy, a giant, totally cystic, vascularized and smooth mass attached to the right ovary was encountered, lying between the symphysis and the xiphoid. Ooferectomy was performed. On the postoperative second day, she was discharged without any problem. Her pathology report disclosed a 35 x 20 x 16 cm(3) serous cyst adenoma weighing 9.5 kg.

As a major glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component of extracellular matrix (ECM), HA is an excellent biopolymeric building block for new biomimetic, biocompatible therapeutic materials. HA hydrogel film samples were surgically implanted in the ear pinnae of mice, and the ears were harvested at 7 or 14 days post-implantation. Histologic analysis showed that each of the groups receiving an implant demonstrated significantly more microvessel density than control ears undergoing surgery but receiving no implant (p<0.001). Treatment groups receiving either co-delivery of both KGF and VEGF, an HA hydrogel lacking a growth factor or HA hydrogels containing a single cytokine were statistically unchanged with time, whereas treatment with KGF alone produced continuing increases in vascularization from day 7 to day 14. Strikingly, presentation of both VEGF and KGF in crosslinked HA generated intact microvessel beds with well-defined borders. In addition, an additive response to co-delivery of both cytokines in the HA hydrogel was observed. The HA hydrogels containing KGF+VEGF produced the greatest angiogenic response of any treatment group tested (NI=5.4 at day 14, where NI is a neovascularization index). This was 33% greater vessel density than in the next largest treatment group, that received HA+KGF (NI=4.0, p<0.002).

In this study, we extended these observations to investigate the long-term survival of such transplants in immunosuppressed rats. Unilateral 6 OHDA lesioned rats received grafts into the dopamine denervated striatum of either primary porcine fetal neural tissue dissected from the E26 cortex or cortically derived neural stem cells which had been derived from the same source but expanded in vitro for 21 days. All cortically derived neural stem cell grafts survived up to 5 months in contrast to the poor survival of primary porcine xenografts. Histological analysis demonstrated good graft integration with fibers extending into the surrounding host tissue including white matter with synapse formation, and in addition there was evidence of host vascularization and myelinated fibers within the graft area. This study has therefore shown for the first time the reliable long-term survival of grafts derived from porcine expanded neural precursors in a rat model of PD, with maturation and integration into the host brain. This demonstrates that such xenografted cells may be able to recreate the damaged circuitry in PD although strategies for dopaminergic differentiation of the porcine neural precursor cell remain to be refined.", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["T PHarrower", "PTyers", "YHooks", "R ABarker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.expneurol.2005.07.026"}

In this study, we investigated the in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) using human glioblastoma cell lines. Glioblastoma cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding BAI1 (AdBAI1), and Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively, demonstrated BAI1 mRNA and protein expression in the transduced tumor cells. Using an in vivo neovascularization assay, we found that angiogenesis surrounding AdBAI1-transduced glioblastoma cells transplanted into transparent skinfold chambers of SCID mice was significantly impaired compared to control treated cells. Additionally, in vivo inoculation with AdBAI1 of established subcutaneous or intracerebral transplanted tumors significantly impaired tumor growth and promoted increased mouse survival. Morphologically, the tumors exhibited signs of impaired angiogenesis, such as extensive necrosis and reduced intratumoral vascular density.

Eighty volume data sets were analyzed using the VOCAL imaging program. EV and VI, FI and VFI of the endometrium and subendometrium (5 mm shell) were manually calculated in the longitudinal and coronal planes with 15 degrees and 9 degrees rotation steps. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess reliability. RESULTS.: EV measurements were highly reproducible (ICC > or = 0.97) without significant differences between planes and rotation steps. Endometrial and subendometrial VI, FI, and VFI presented ICCs above 0.90 with the exception of the subendometrial FI (ICC > or = 0.80). There were no significant differences according to measurement plane and rotation step except for subendometrial VFI. Nevertheless, 3D power Doppler indices calculated in the coronal plane and 9 degrees rotation step obtained the highest ICC. ICCs for 3D-PDA indices from the tumoral endometria were significantly higher than those calculated from the stimulated endometria.\nEndometrial volume and endometrial and subendometrial 3D power Doppler indices have an acceptable reproducibility, significantly higher in tumoral endometria.

We have previously established that Klf6 is expressed in neuronal tissue, hindgut, heart, lung, kidney, and limb buds during midgestation. To explore the potential role of Klf6 in mouse development, we analyzed Klf6-/- mice and found that the homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal by embryonic day (E) 12.5 and associated with markedly reduced hematopoiesis and poorly organized yolk sac vascularization. Additionally, mRNA levels of Scl and Gata1 were reduced by approximately 80% in Klf6-/- yolk sacs. To further analyze this phenotype, we generated Klf6-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination, and compared their capacity to differentiate into the hematopoietic lineage with that of either Klf6+/- or Klf6+/+ ES cells. Consistent with the phenotype in the early embryo, Klf6-/- ES cells displayed significant hematopoietic defects following differentiation into EBs. Prolongation of epiblast-like cells and delays in mesoderm induction were also observed in the Klf6-/- EBs, associated with delayed expression of Brachyury, Klf1, and Gata1. Forced expression of KLF6 using a tet-inducible system enhanced the hematopoietic potential of wild-type EBs.

The composite AECM composed of ChS-Chito conjugated network was prepared by a homogenizing interpolyelectrolyte complex/covalent conjugation technique through co-crosslinked with N,N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). In contrast to EDC/NHS, two different reagents, calcium ion and glutaraldehyde, were used to react with ChS or Chito for the preparation of ChS-Chito composites containing crosslinked ChS or Chito network in the matrix. The stability and in vitro enzymatic degradability of the glutaraldehyde-, EDC/NHS-, and Ca2+ -crosslinked ChS-Chito composite AECMs were all investigated in this study. The results showed that crosslinking improved the stability of prepared ChS-Chito AECMs in physiological buffer solution (PBS) and provided superior protective effect against the enzymatic hydrolysis of ChS, compared with their non-crosslinked counterpart. Because ChS was a heparin-like glycosaminoglycan (GAG), the ChS-Chito composite AECMs appeared to promote binding efficiency for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The bFGF releasing from the ChS-Chito composite AECMs retained its biological activity as examined by the in vitro proliferation of human fibroblast, depending on the crosslinking mode for the preparation of these composite AECMs. Histological assay showed that the EDC/NHS-crosslinked ChS-Chito composite AECM, after incorporated with bFGF, was biodegradable and could result in a significantly enhanced vascularization effect and tissue penetration.

Using the supraclavicular route, the PMMF reliably transfers large amounts of well-vascularized skin and muscle into defects of the upper aerodigestive tract. However, limited length and arc of rotation as well as excessive bulk can be problematic.\nIn the current study, these problems have been addressed by passing the pedicle deeply to the clavicle. Following flap harvest, the pedicle was passed in the subclavicular plane in 15 head and neck cancer patients for primary and secondary reconstruction.\nUsing this route it was possible to increase the medium length of PMMF to 3 cm compared to the supraclavicular route. No total flap necrosis occurred, however, temporary complications were observed in three of 15 cases (20%)--partial flap necrosis occurred in two cases and fistula formation was observed in one case. This rate is in accordance with complication rates described for the supraclavicular route. However, in long-term follow-ups we observed a fracture of the clavicle in two patients in whom, in contrast to the others, the periostium was not only prepared posteriorly but over the whole circumference.\nThe subclavicular route for PMMF increases the length and arc of rotation available for reconstruction without compromising vascular supply to a higher degree than with the conventional supraclavicular route. Furthermore, this concept decreases the bulk of the PMMF pedicle which is functionally and cosmetically favourable. Thus, the subclavicular route of PMMF is safe and allows an extension of the reconstructive possibilities.", "journal": "HNO", "date": "2005-10-13", "authors": ["T KHoffmann", "HBall\u00f3", "UHauser", "HBier"], "doi": "10.1007/s00106-005-1344-9"}
{"title": "Heparanase promotes growth, angiogenesis and survival of primary breast tumors.", "abstract": "Despite great strides toward diagnosis and therapy, breast cancer remains a most threatening disease in its incidence, morbidity and mortality; therefore, additional knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms contributing to breast cancer progression, as well as new targets for drug discovery are highly needed. Heparanase is the predominant enzyme involved in cleavage of heparan sulfate, the main polysaccharide component of the extracellular matrix. Experimental and clinical data indicate that heparanase plays important roles in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. In breast carcinoma patients, heparanase expression correlates with the metastatic potential of the tumor. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of heparanase in local growth and angiogenesis of primary breast tumors. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were stable transfected with the human heparanase (H-hpa) cDNA, or empty vector (mock), and injected into the mammary pad of nude mice. MRI was applied to monitor progression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. We demonstrate that tumors produced by cells overexpressing heparanase grew faster and were 7-fold larger than tumors produced by mock transfected cells. This enhanced growth was accompanied by increased tumor vascularization and a higher degree of vessel maturation. Histological examination ascribed the differences in tumor growth to heparanase-stimulated cell proliferation and survival. In-vitro experiments reinforced heparanase role as a survival factor under stress conditions. Moreover, H-hpa tumor cells infiltrate into the adjacent stroma, promoting formation of highly vascularized fibrous bands.

This process is controlled exquisitely by cellular interactions with the surrounding matrix, growth and differentiation factors, and other environmental factors that initiate or suppress cellular signaling pathways and transcription of specific genes in a temporal-spatial manner. Vertebrate limb development is controlled by interacting patterning systems involving prominently the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and hedgehog pathways. Both positive and negative signaling kinases and transcription factors, such as Sox9 and Runx2, and interactions among them determine whether the differentiated chondrocytes remain within cartilage elements in articular joints or undergo hypertrophic maturation prior to ossification. The latter process requires extracellular matrix remodeling and vascularization controlled by mechanisms that are not understood completely.

Eleven knee joints were injected with colored latex and the arteries were dissected macroscopically. The ATRA yielded several osseous branches supplying the tibial metaphysis and the anterior part of the tibial epiphysis and several rami supplying the anterior tibial tuberosity and the lower part of the patellar tendon. The ILGA ran under the lateral collateral ligament and had a horizontal direction towards the retro-patellar fat pad. The ILGA yielded 4-6 branches ascending or descending perpendicularly to its main direction. Full anastomoses between branches derived from the ATRA and the ILGA were observed in front and behind the lateral intercondylar tubercle in all the specimens, but each vessel seemed to provide predominantly the blood supply to a specific area. The anterior part of the LTC drew its blood supply from the ATRA, the posterior part from the ILGA and the mid-portion from both arteries. The standard anterolateral approach to LTC fractures with sub-meniscal arthrotomy appears particularly harmful to epiphyseal vascularization since it interrupts many of the branches deriving from the ILGA and ATRA.

VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF) activate VEGFR-1 selectively, however, mice lacking either ligand display only minor developmental defects. We hypothesized that the relative contributions of VEGF-B and PlGF to VEGFR-1 signaling may be masked in the presence of VEGF-A, which is abundantly expressed during postnatal development. To test this hypothesis, neonatal or adult mice were treated with a monoclonal antibody (G6-23-IgG) blocking murine VEGF-A or a soluble VEGFR-1 receptor IgG chimeric construct [mFlt(1-3)-IgG], which neutralizes VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF. Both compounds attenuated growth and survival of neonatal mice to similar extents and the pathophysiologic alterations, including a reduction in organ size and vascularization, changes in gene expression, and hematologic end points, were essentially indistinguishable. In adult mice, we observed only minor changes in response to treatment, which were similar between both anti-VEGF compounds. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PlGF and VEGF-B do not compensate during conditions of VEGF-A blockade, suggesting a minor role for compensatory VEGFR-1 signaling during postnatal development and vascular homeostasis in adults.

{"title": "Management of radiation-induced tracheocutaneous tissue defects by transplantation of an ear cartilage graft and deltopectoral flap.", "abstract": "Patients suffering from head and neck cancer often require temporary tracheostomy during therapy. The tracheostomy can usually be closed when postoperative swelling decreases and swallowing ability recovers. However, some patients, especially after adjuvant radiotherapy, may develop severe chronic wounds resulting in persistent tracheocutaneous fistula.

We present two patients with head and neck cancer treated with primary surgical regimen including temporary tracheostomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. Both patients developed a persistent, poorly healing wound with persistent tracheocutaneous tissue defect. After local debridement and wound care, the peristomal necrotic tissue was excised down to the level of the trachea. The defect of the anterior tracheal wall was closed with a autogenous ear cartilage graft. The graft was harvested from the cavum conchae and sutured to the tracheal defect.

{"title": "The impact of proteinase-induced matrix degradation on the release of VEGF from heparinized collagen matrices.", "abstract": "The in vivo application of engineered matrices in human wound healing processes is often hampered by the slow rate of vascularization. Therefore much research is directed towards enhancing the angiogenic properties of such matrices. One approach for enhancing the vascularization is the incorporation of angiogenic growth factors. Recently, we and others have reported on immobilizing such factors into collagen matrices either by covalent attachment or by physical binding to covalently incorporated heparin. Especially the latter procedure has been shown to lead to substantial increase rates in vascularization in in vivo experiments. The increases have been proposed to depend on the sustained release of the incorporated angiogenic growth factors from the heparinized collagen matrices. In this paper, we report on investigations to study the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from collagen matrices under conditions which mimic potential in vivo situations. Relevant proteinase concentrations were deduced from in vitro experiments in which we evaluated the secretion of selected matrix metalloproteinases from fibroblasts in contact with collagen. The release of VEGF from non-modified, cross-linked and heparinized collagen matrices in the absence and in the presence of varying concentrations of proteinases was then determined by ELISA and liquid scintillation counting. The release behaviour appears to be controlled by both the presence of heparin and the levels of proteinases applied. Experiments with matrices containing radioactively labelled heparin suggest that VEGF release results from the consecutive and simultaneous release of three species of VEGF molecules that differ in their binding affinities to the differently modified collagen matrices. The species binding specifically to heparin most likely accounts for the previously observed increases in angiogenic potential between loading VEGF to non-heparinized and heparinized collagen matrices.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2005-09-27", "authors": ["ChangYao", "MartinRoderfeld", "TimoRath", "ElkeRoeb", "J\u00fcrgenBernhagen", "GuySteffens"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.08.037"}

To elucidate the role of angiogenic factors, we investigated in vivo whether blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) affects angiogenesis of ectopic endometrium.\nMechanically isolated endometrial fragments were transplanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of hormonally synchronized hamsters. Subsequently, we analysed the effect of the VEGF inhibitor SU5416 and the combined VEGF, FGF and PDGF inhibitor SU6668 on angiogenesis of the ectopic endometrium over a time-period of 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy.\nSelective blockade of VEGF resulted in a slight reduction of microvessel density when compared to control animals. In contrast, combined inhibition of all three growth factors significantly suppressed angiogenesis of endometrial grafts, as indicated by a reduced size of the microvascular network and a decreased microvessel density. This was caused by an inhibition of blood vessel maturation.\nVascularization of endometriotic lesions is not solely driven by VEGF, but depends on the cross-talk between VEGF, FGF and PDGF. Thus, the combined inhibition of these growth factors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of endometriosis.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2005-09-21", "authors": ["M WLaschke", "AElitzsch", "BVollmar", "PVajkoczy", "M DMenger"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/dei308"}

The islet endothelium is richly fenestrated to facilitate trans-endothelial transport of secreted hormones, has a unique expression of surface markers, and produces a number of vasoactive substances and growth factors. The islet endothelial cells play a critical role in the early phase of type 1 diabetes mellitus by increasing the expression of surface leucocyte-homing receptors, thereby enabling immune cells to enter the endocrine tissue and cause beta-cell destruction.

{"title": "Elevated expression of hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha in terminally differentiating growth plate chondrocytes.", "abstract": "Growth plate chondrocytes exist in a hypoxic environment where it is recognized that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is essential for their survival. Its regulation of chondrocyte viability may be mediated by the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glycolytic enzymes. However, the full chondrocyte response to hypoxia and the molecular control of VEGF expression in relation to growth plate differentiation and vascularization remains poorly understood. Using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, chick chondrocytes were separated into populations of different maturational phenotype. A differential display analysis of the populations showed highly upregulated expression of HIF-2alpha mRNA during chondrocyte differentiation. HIF-2alpha is a homologue of the HIF-1alpha transcription factor, both of which play a role in the activation of a number of hypoxia responsive genes. HIF-1alpha mRNA was also found to be expressed, although levels of expression were found to be similar in all of the chondrocyte fractions. The elevated expression of HIF-2alpha during chondrocyte differentiation was accompanied by increased VEGF expression. Analysis of the murine chondrocyte cell line, ATDC5, which undergoes ordered maturation indicated that HIF-2alpha, VEGF, placental growth factor, and glucose transporter-1 expression all increased in parallel with chondrocyte differentiation. This observation was supported by immunohistochemistry on sections of mouse bone which showed staining corresponding to the presence of HIF-2alpha in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes. The presence of HIF-2alpha was also observed in articular chondrocytes but was restricted to the superficial tangential zone. HIF-2alpha is, therefore, likely to be involved in the initiation of blood vessel formation and a metabolic shift in the growth plate, processes crucial for endochondral ossification.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2005-09-13", "authors": ["Alan JStewart", "BrianHouston", "ColinFarquharson"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.20481"}
{"title": "Isolation and culture of microvascular endothelial cells from gliomas of different WHO grades.", "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common intrinsic brain tumors. The degree of vascularization corresponds to malignancy and is related to prognosis. In order to retrieve information about tumor behavior in situ, the use of primary tissue material for experiments is advantageous. With increasing evidence for the importance of microenvironment and vascularization in tumor biology, we concentrated on the isolation of endothelial cells (EC) from primary tumor material to investigate the role of endothelium within tumor tissue. We developed a method for isolation and purification of tumor-derived endothelial cells. EC were isolated and cultivated from normal brain using tissue digestion and Percoll density gradient centrifugation resulting in a <95% of EC culture. For isolation of EC from gliomas of different malignancy grades a combination of tissue digestion, Percoll gradient centrifugation and magnetic bead sorting by anti-CD31, -VE-Cadherin and -CD 105 was employed. This approach provided a purity of <98%. Cells were classified and characterized by testing expression of CD105, CD31, VE-Cadherin, vWF, UEA-1 and measuring DiI-Ac-LDL-uptake. To exclude contamination, staining and negative selection with anti-SMA, -GFAP, and -CD68 was performed. Tumors were histopathologically diagnosed according to WHO classification. We isolated EC from normal brain (NBEC, n = 11), low-grade gliomas WHO II (LGEC, n = 22), and high-grade gliomas WHO III & IV (HGEC, n = 11). There were no clear differences in EC morphology between the different tumor grades. However, a significantly higher proliferation rate of HGEC compared to LGEC was observed as well as distinctive antigen expression. Already in early passages isolated EC showed a rapid change in antigen expression indicating a phenotypic shift under culture conditions. We could establish a protocol for reliable and reproducible isolation and culture of EC from gliomas with different WHO grading. In first phenotypical and functional analyses, NBEC, LGEC and HGEC show remarkable differences. EC from all tumors could be grown in culture.

A total of 93 blastocysts obtained by nuclear transfer of somatic cells (granulosa cells) were transferred into 41 recipient ewes, and pregnancies were monitored by ultrasound scanning. In vitro derived, fertilized embryos (IVF, n=123) were also transferred to assess oocyte competence, and naturally mated ewes (n=120) were analysed as well. Cloned embryos developed to the blastocyst stage and implanted at the same rate as IVF embryos.

Three full-term lamb clones were delivered stillborn, as a result of placental degeneration. A further five clone recipients developed hydroallantois. Their lambs died within 24h following delivery by caesarian section, and displayed degenerative lesions in liver and kidney resulting from the severe hydroallantois. One set of twins was delivered by assisted parturition at day 150, but died 24h later due to respiratory distress syndrome. The remaining two clone recipients underwent caesarian section, and the corresponding two lambs displayed signs of respiratory dysfunction and died at approximately 1 month of age due to a bacterial complication. Blood samples collected from the cloned lambs after birth revealed a wide range of abnormalities indicative of kidney and liver dysfunction. Macroscopical and histopathological examination of the placentae revealed a marked reduction in vascularization, particularly at the apex of the villous processes, as well as a loss of differentiation of the trophoblastic epithelium.

{"title": "Pathogenesis and genetic basis for retinopathy of prematurity.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative disorder affecting preterm infants with low gestational age and birth weight. In general more than 50% of preterm infants weighing less than 1250 g at birth show evidence of ROP and about 10% of the infants develop stage 3 ROP. However, retinal detachment occurs and leads to visual loss in only a few percent of infants with stage 3 or more severe ROP, and in most cases, spontaneously regresses. The most conspicuous question is why ROP in some premature infants progresses despite rigorous and timely intervention while in other cases with similar clinical characteristics it regresses. Genetic differences between the infants could be an explanation. Although many causative factors, like low birth weight, low gestational age and supplemental oxygen therapy are associated with ROP, several indirect lines of evidence suggest the role of a genetic component in the pathogenesis of ROP. The incidence of ROP is more frequent in white than in black infants and in males than in females. Genetic polymorphism may alter the function of the genes which normally control retinal vascularization, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may also be involved in pathogenesis of ROP. Evaluation of candidate genetic polymorphism influencing the outcome of ROP may provide new information about the pathogenesis of the disease.

{"title": "Blood monocytes mimic endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "The generation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from blood monocytes has been propagated as a novel approach in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and lectin binding together with endothelial marker expression are commonly used to define these EPCs. Considerable controversy exists regarding their nature, in particular, because myelomonocytic cells share several properties with endothelial cells (ECs). This study was performed to elucidate whether the commonly used endothelial marker determination is sufficient to distinguish supposed EPCs from monocytes. We measured endothelial, hematopoietic, and progenitor cell marker expression of monocytes before and after angiogenic culture by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The function of primary monocytes and monocyte-derived supposed EPCs was investigated during vascular network formation and EC colony-forming unit (CFU-EC) development. Monocytes cultured for 4 to 6 days under angiogenic conditions lost CD14/CD45 and displayed a commonly accepted EPC phenotype, including LDL uptake and lectin binding, CD31/CD105/CD144 reactivity, and formation of cord-like structures. Strikingly, primary monocytes already expressed most tested endothelial genes and proteins at even higher levels than their supposed EPC progeny. Neither fresh nor cultured monocytes formed vascular networks, but CFU-EC formation was strictly dependent on monocyte presence. LDL uptake, lectin binding, and CD31/CD105/CD144 expression are inherent features of monocytes, making them phenotypically indistinguishable from putative EPCs.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated markedly higher expression of Ppara, Pparg, and Rxra mRNA in labyrinth zone trophoblast as compared with basal zone near term.

{"title": "Early-outgrowth of endothelial progenitor cells can function as antigen-presenting cells.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been recently found to exist circulating in peripheral blood of adults, and home to sites of neovascularization in peripheral tissues. They can also be differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). In tumor tissues, EPCs are found in highly vascularized lesions. Few reports exist in the literature concerning the characteristics of EPCs, especially related to their surface antigen expressions, except for endothelial markers. Here, we aimed to investigate the surface expression of differentiation markers, and the functional activities of early-outgrowth of EPCs (EO-EPCs), especially focusing on their antigen-presenting ability. EO-EPCs were generated from PBMNCs, by culture in the presence of angiogenic factors. These EO-EPCs had the morphological and functional features of endothelial cells and, additionally, they shared antigen-presenting ability. They induced the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes in a mixed-lymphocyte reaction, and could generate cytotoxic lymphocytes, with the ability to lyze tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner. The antigen-presenting ability of EO-EPCs, however, was weaker than that of monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but stronger than peripheral blood monocytes. Since EO-EPCs play an important role in the development of tumor angiogenesis, targeting EPCs would be an effective anti-angiogenic strategy. Alternatively, due to their antigen-presenting ability, EO-EPCs can be used as the effectors of anti-tumor immunotherapy. Since they share endothelial antigens, the activation of a cellular immunity against angiogenic vessels can be expected.

Extensive vascularization was observed in FN mats by 1 week along with heavy macrophage infiltration by 3 days post-implantation. By 1 week post-implantation, laminin tubules had formed and were associated with axons and p75 immunoreactive Schwann cells. By 4 weeks post-implantation, most axons were associated with Schwann cell derived myelin. Few oligodendrocytes were present within the mat, even with an increase in the number of oligodendrocyte precursors around the implant site by 7 days post-implantation. Astrocyte proliferation also occurred in the intact tissue, with a prominent glial scar forming around the implant within 4 weeks. However, by 2 months post-implantation astrocytes were present in the FN implant site and were intermingled with the axons. Axonal ingrowth and integration of the FN mats is probably due to the ability of FN mats to support and organize infiltration of Schwann cells and deposition of laminin. At later time points, myelinated axons remain in the implant site, even after other elements (e.g. macrophages and laminin) have disappeared. Both of these properties are likely to be important in the design of biomaterial bridges for CNS regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2005-08-17", "authors": ["V RKing", "J BPhillips", "HHunt-Grubbe", "RBrown", "J VPriestley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.06.033"}
{"title": "In vivo flow territory mapping of major brain feeding arteries.", "abstract": "The ability to visualize the perfusion territories of major feeding arteries to the brain is important for many clinical applications. Since the work of Duret in 1874 on vascularization of the brain, many textbooks and atlases have shown schematic drawings of the supply areas of the major cerebral arteries. Recent postmortem studies demonstrated that the variability of the cerebral vascular territories is significantly greater than previously assumed. The aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo, the variability of flow territories of major brain feeding arteries. Flow territory mapping of the anterior (internal carotid arteries) and posterior (basilar artery) circulation was performed in 115 (58 +/- 9 years of age) subjects with selective arterial spin labeling MRI. Flow territory maps for the entire population indicated significant variation in flow territories. However, when the subjects are further categorized into groups with a complete circle of Willis, with a missing A1 segment and with a unilateral or bilateral fetal-type posterior cerebral artery, the results showed considerably lower variation within groups. It is therefore concluded that, the variation observed from the entire population is mainly caused by anatomical variants of the circle of Willis. To relate focal brain lesions to underlying flow territories in individual cases, knowledge of the anatomy of the circle of Willis is essential.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2005-08-13", "authors": ["Peter Janvan Laar", "JeroenHendrikse", "XavierGolay", "HanzhangLu", "Matthias J Pvan Osch", "Jeroenvan der Grond"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.07.011"}
{"title": "Computational modeling of multicellular constructs with the material point method.", "abstract": "Computational modeling of the mechanics of cells and multicellular constructs with standard numerical discretization techniques such as the finite element (FE) method is complicated by the complex geometry, material properties and boundary conditions that are associated with such systems. The objectives of this research were to apply the material point method (MPM), a meshless method, to the modeling of vascularized constructs by adapting the algorithm to accurately handle quasi-static, large deformation mechanics, and to apply the modified MPM algorithm to large-scale simulations using a discretization that was obtained directly from volumetric confocal image data. The standard implicit time integration algorithm for MPM was modified to allow the background computational grid to remain fixed with respect to the spatial distribution of material points during the analysis. This algorithm was used to simulate the 3D mechanics of a vascularized scaffold under tension, consisting of growing microvascular fragments embedded in a collagen gel, by discretizing the construct with over 13.6 million material points. Baseline 3D simulations demonstrated that the modified MPM algorithm was both more accurate and more robust than the standard MPM algorithm. Scaling studies demonstrated the ability of the parallel code to scale to 200 processors. Optimal discretization was established for the simulations of the mechanics of vascularized scaffolds by examining stress distributions and reaction forces. Sensitivity studies demonstrated that the reaction force during simulated extension was highly sensitive to the modulus of the microvessels, despite the fact that they comprised only 10.4% of the volume of the total sample. In contrast, the reaction force was relatively insensitive to the effective Poisson's ratio of the entire sample. These results suggest that the MPM simulations could form the basis for estimating the modulus of the embedded microvessels through a parameter estimation scheme. Because of the generality and robustness of the modified MPM algorithm, the relative ease of generating spatial discretizations from volumetric image data, and the ability of the parallel computational implementation to scale to large processor counts, it is anticipated that this modeling approach may be extended to many other applications, including the analysis of other multicellular constructs and investigations of cell mechanics.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2005-08-13", "authors": ["James EGuilkey", "James BHoying", "Jeffrey AWeiss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.06.017"}
{"title": "Significance of vascular stabilization for tumor growth and metastasis.", "abstract": "This mini review highlights the role of vascular stabilization which is apparently mediated by factors belonging to both the pro- and anti-angiogenic group. Knowingly angiopoietin-1 has pro-angiogenic properties while endostatin acts anti-angiogenic. But both factors suppress tumor growth in experimental tumor models. The crossing points of mechanisms of their action are the parameters vascular stabilization and vascular permeability, which are of high importance not only for tumor vascularization, but also for tissue vascularization in general. Both angiopoietin-1 and endostatin reduce the vascular permeability, but promote vascular stabilization. Vascular stabilization is significantly increased under experimental treatment of tumors with angiogenesis inhibitors such as endostatin. It inhibits tumor growth and probably tumor metastasis. The understanding of temporal and spatial sequences of vascular stabilization is an important challenge for scientists working on tumor vascularization and anti-angiogenic tumor therapy.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2005-08-09", "authors": ["SuleymanErgun", "DeryaTilki", "LeticiaOliveira-Ferrer", "GunterSchuch", "NerbilKilic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2005.06.033"}
{"title": "A new method to model change in cutaneous blood flow due to mechanical skin irritation part I: comparison between experimental and numerical data.", "abstract": "Mechanical skin irritation creates vasodilation. Vasodilation of vascular networks induces increase in blood volume and blood velocity. Both can be measured by Laser Doppler Velocimetry. We propose in this article a method permitting comparison between experimental and numerical results. Experimental data was obtained by Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Numerical results were obtained by a continuous model of the vascular network. The model consists of three layers. First and last layer are described by anisotropic and heterogeneous porous media. They represent the irrigation and the drainage of the vascular system. The intermediate layer is described by a lumped parameter model that does not permit horizontal fluxes. All vessels are compliant. The permeabilities depend on the volumes of the specific layer. Skin irritation is modeled by a change in compliance of small arterial blood vessels. The comparison between experimental and numerical data is based on the model proposed by Bonner and Nossal [1981. Model for laser Doppler measurements of blood flow. Appl. Opt. 20, 2097-2107]. The model describes the Doppler frequency spectrum S(omega) as a function of the optical phenomena creating the frequency shift. The comparison is based on the model of the first moment M1 approximately integralomegaS(omega)domega. The variables of the first moment can be determined by results of the numerical model. We have shown, that it exists a linear relation between the change in compliance and the following increase in first moment.

A luciferase-expressing human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was generated and termed PC3-Luc. PC3-Luc cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors engineering the expression of either enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or both H2 relaxin and eGFP in a bicistronic format. These transduced cells were termed PC3-Luc-eGFP and PC3-Luc-H2/eGFP, respectively. To gauge effects, PC3-Luc-H2/eGFP and PC3-Luc-eGFP cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice and monitored over 6 weeks. PC-3 tumor xenografts overexpressing H2 relaxin exhibited greater tumor volumes compared to control tumors. Circulating H2 relaxin levels in sera increased with the relative size of the tumor, with moderately elevated H2 relaxin levels in mice bearing PC3-Luc-H2/eGFP tumors compared to PC3-Luc-eGFP tumors. Zymographic analysis demonstrated that proMMP-9 enzyme activity was significantly downregulated in H2 relaxin-overexpressing tumors. An advanced angiogenic phenotype was observed in H2 relaxin-overexpressing tumors indicated by greater intratumoral vascularization by immunohistochemical staining of endothelial cells with anti-mouse CD31. Moreover, PC3-Luc-H2/eGFP tumors exhibited increased VEGF transcript by reverse-transcription PCR, compared to basal levels in control animals.

The study attempted to interpret the correlation between the presence of the HIZ on MRI and awake discography, as well as its characteristic pathology. Fifty two patients with low back pain without disc herniation underwent MRI and discography successively. Each disc with HIZ was correlated for an association between the presence of a HIZ and the grading of annular disruption and a concordant pain response. Eleven specimens of lumbar intervertebral discs which contain HIZ in the posterior annulus from 11 patients with discogenic low back pain were harvested for histologic examination to interpret the histologic basis of a nociceptive response during posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). The study found that in all of 142 discograms in 52 patients, 17 presented HIZ. All 17 discs with HIZ showed painful reproduction and abnormal morphology with annular tears extending either well into or through the outer third of the annulus fibrosus. The consecutive sagittal slices through the HIZ lesion showed that a notable histologic feature of the formation of vascularized granulation tissue in the outer region of the annulus fibrosus.

{"title": "Morphological appearance, content of extracellular matrix and vascular density of lung metastases predicts permissiveness to infiltration by adoptively transferred natural killer and T cells.", "abstract": "We have recently shown that adoptively transferred, IL-2-activated natural killer (A-NK) cells are able to eliminate well-established B16-F10.P1 melanoma lung metastases. However, some B16-F10.P1 lung metastases were resistant to infiltration by the A-NK cells and also resistant to the A-NK cell treatment. The infiltration-resistant (I-R) B16-F10.P1 metastases had a unique \"compact\" morphology compared to the \"loose\" morphology of the infiltration-permissive (I-P) metastases. Here, we show that I-P loose tumors and I-R compact tumors are also found in lung metastases of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL), MCA-102 sarcoma, and MC38 colon carcinoma as well as rat MADB106 mammary carcinoma origin. Furthermore, the infiltration resistance of the compact tumors is not restricted to A-NK cells, since PHA and IL-2 stimulated CD8+ T-cells (T-LAK cells) also infiltrated the compact tumors poorly. Analyses of tumors for extracellular matrix (ECM) components and PECAM-1(+) vasculature, revealed that the I-R lesions are hypovascularized and contain very little laminin, collagen and fibronectin. In contrast, the I-P loose tumors are well-vascularized and they contain high amounts of ECM components. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of ECM components in the I-P loose tumors is almost identical to that of the normal lung tissue, indicating that these tumors develop around the alveolar walls which provide the loose tumors with both a supporting tissue and a rich blood supply. In conclusion, tumor infiltration by activated NK and T cells correlates with the presence of ECM components and PECAM-1(+) vasculature in the malignant tissue. Thus, analysis of the distribution of ECM and vasculature in tumor biopsies may help select patients most likely to benefit from cellular adoptive immunotherapy.", "journal": "Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII", "date": "2005-07-28", "authors": ["QYang", "SGoding", "MHagenaars", "TCarlos", "PAlbertsson", "PKuppen", "UNannmark", "M EHokland", "P HBasse"], "doi": "10.1007/s00262-005-0043-4"}

The aim of this study was to characterise the histomorphometry of terminal villi in shared and non-shared cotyledons in monochorionic placentae, both from uncomplicated twins and from those with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or discordant growth restriction (DeltaIUGR).\nForty-one monochorionic placentae from Caucasian non-smokers were obtained at caesarean section. Their vascular anatomy and placental territories were ascertained by dye injection. After fixation, full thickness histological blocks were obtained by systematic random sampling from each twin's territory and the shared cotyledons. Fifty randomly selected terminal villi were assessed for: (i) median villus diameter (ii) median villus capillary diameter (iii) median fetomaternal diffusion distance (iv) median no. of capillaries/villus (v) degree of vascularization (median percentage cross-sectional area of terminal villi occupied by capillaries) using a stage micrometer and image analysis programme. The histomorphometric findings were then correlated with birthweight discordance, placental territory discordance and DeltaAVAs (no. of AVAs from smaller twin (donor) to larger twin (recipient) minus no. of AVAs from larger to smaller twin).\nHistomorphometric variables were similar in shared and non-shared cotyledons of uncomplicated MCDA twins. However, the median diameter of terminal villi in shared cotyledons in DeltaIUGR and TTTS placentae was significantly smaller [51.2 microm (48.2-58.3), p<0.001 and 52.6 microm (53.1-50.4), p<0.001], and had a similar number of smaller capillaries, larger fetomaternal diffusion distance and reduced vascularization compared to non-shared IUGR and TTTS placentae. However, Deltadiameter (defined as the difference between median diameters of terminal villi in large minus small twins' territories) rose with increasing birthweight discordance (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.82, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Deltadiameter was influenced by placental territory discordance (p<0.001) and birthweight discordance (p<0.01): log10 Deltadiameter=1.38+(0.01 x birthweight discordance)+(0.56 x log10 placental territory discordance) (R2=0.82, p<0.001), but there was no significant relationship with DeltaAVA and AAA. In the TTTS group, Deltadiameter correlated significantly with DeltaAVA only: log10Deltadiameter=1.44+(0.02 x DeltaAVA) (R2=0.3, p<0.001).\nThis is the first study to characterise the histomorphometry of shared and non-shared cotyledons in MC twins.

However, little is known about the direct effects of VEGF on tumor cells. In this study, we investigate the ability of VEGF to promote proliferation and invasion of human glioma cells (U251n). Since the chemokine and its receptor, SDF-1/CXCR4, promote glioma cell proliferation and are up-regulated in human glioblastomas, we also tested the effects of VEGF on SDF-1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression. Using cell culture, the effect of VEGF on proliferation of U251n cells was measured using ELISA to detect incorporated BrdU as a marker of DNA syntheses. The effects of VEGF and SDF-1 on U251n cell invasion and proliferation were measured using inhibitors to VEGF receptor1 and receptor2, DC101 and MF1, respectively, and a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100). SDF-1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression in U251n and U87MG cells were measured using quantitative PCR. VEGF antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-VEGF) was also used to down-regulate VEGF expression in U251n cells. VEGF significantly increased U251n cell proliferation and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were blocked by the VEGF receptor inhibitors, DC101/MF1.

In a clinical case with complete reconstruction of the nose after nasal ablation and complete loss of a radial lower forearm flap that had been transplanted previously due to a recurrent tumor, the possibility of forming and modeling a TRAM flap is demonstrated.\nThe flap vessels of the TRAM are comparable to the radial forearm flap, and the donor site may be primarily closed. The TRAM proved to be a suitable alternative to close lesions of the head and neck area in selected cases. The myocutaneous TRAM is bulkier than the fascio-cutaneous radial forearm flap. The subcutaneous abdominal fat of the TRAM can be reduced in relation to the vascular distribution of the perforator vessels. If the subcutaneous fat of the flap is reduced, the flap can be shaped and formed well. In the described case, it was used to close the lesion after ablation of the nose and middle face.\nThe risk of an iatrogenic lesion of the peritoneal fascia or postsurgical herniation of the abdominal wall is low if several surgical prerequisites are taken into consideration.
