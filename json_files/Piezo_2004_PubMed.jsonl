{"title": "Biomimetic properties and surface studies of a piezoelectric caffeine sensor based on electrosynthesized polypyrrole.", "abstract": "An approach for preparing a chemical sensor for caffeine through the combination of molecularly imprinted polypyrrole and a piezoelectric quartz transducer was proposed. The caffeine-imprinted polymer was synthesized using galvanostatic electropolymerization of pyrrole monomer directly onto one of the gold electrodes of a 9MHz AT-cut quartz crystal in the presence of caffeine. The optimum conditions for the electrosynthesis of the reagent phase were established. Caffeine molecules were entrapped in the matrix of polymer film, and were removed by subsequent washing with water, leaving behind pores capable of recognizing the target analyte molecule. The caffeine sensor was fixed in a measuring cell and measurement of the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal as it comes in contact with the caffeine solution was carried out in a stopped flow mode. A steady-state response was achieved in about 10min. The sensor exhibited a linear relationship between the frequency shift and the ln of caffeine concentration in the range of 0.1-10mg/mL (correlation coefficient, r=0.9882). The sensitivity of the sensor was about 255Hz/ln concentration (mg/mL). A good repeatability, R.S.D.=9 (n=6) for 0.5mg/mL caffeine solution was also observed. The use of the sensor can present a potential low-cost option for determining caffeine. Surface analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on the polymer coating in order to elucidate the imprinting process and rebinding of caffeine to the polymer matrix during the sensing process. The SEM micrographs and XPS spectra revealed features and structures that could support the imprinting and recognition of caffeine molecule by the imprinted polymer.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["Benilda SEbarvia", "SharleneCabanilla", "FortunatoSevilla"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2004.10.009"}

{"title": "A reusable piezo-immunosensor with amplified sensitivity for ceruloplasmin based on plasma-polymerized film.", "abstract": "A reusable piezoelectric immunosensor with amplified sensitivity has been developed for the detection of ceruloplasmin (CP) in human serum. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was deposited with plasma-polymerized n-butyl amine film with the surface topology further characterized by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Anti-ceruloplasmin antibody (CP-Ab) was electrostatically adsorbed on the PPF-modified crystal via an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte layer of alginate. It was found that the alginate-mediated immobilization interface could allow for antibodies to be largely immobilized with well-retained immunoactivity. In particular, a simple regeneration process for the sensor produced, i.e. by shifting the pH, can also be realized. Moreover, an optimized assay medium containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) was tested with enhanced immunosensing response (sensitivity). A dynamic concentration range of two orders of magnitude and a detection limit of 0.15mugml(-1) of CP were observed. Analytical results of clinical samples show that the developed immunoassay is comparable with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.

{"title": "A signal analysis algorithm for determining brain compliance non-invasively.", "abstract": "Patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by hydrocephalus or brain injury have poor brain compliance or increased brain stiffness. The condition is commonly treated by a surgical diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. These inserted devices frequently fail and require replacement. Assessment of failed devices typically requires an invasive surgical procedure to implant an ICP sensor. Brain compliance can be determined non-invasively by comparing the intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform to the digital artery waveform. The ICP waveform is derived from a piezo sensor snugged into the external ear canal and worn as a headset. The digital artery waveform is derived from a stand pulse oximeter. Digital signal processing performed on sampled data from these two sensors shows a time-lag or phase relationship between the two waves which widens with worsening brain stiffness or compliance. An algorithm is presented that shows how these signals can be used to compute brain compliance. An instrument designed to calculate real-time brain compliance to aid healthcare professionals is described.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

Tracheal sounds were acquired using a contact piezoelectric sensor placed on the examinee's throat and analyzed using a combined investigation of the sound envelope and frequency content. RR estimates were compared to reference measurements taken from a pneumotachometer coupled to a face mask worn by the examinee. RR was also manually counted by a respiratory technician. Two types of breathing (mouth and nose) and three different positions were studied (fowler, semi-fowler and supine). RR estimated in volunteers had a success rate (SR) of 96%, a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99 and a standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 0.56. The RR estimated in patients was comparable or slightly better (SR = 85%, r = 0.93 and SEE = 1.49) than those obtained by manual count (SR = 82%, r = 0.91, SEE = 1.58), which is the method widely used in clinical settings.

{"title": "Robotic-assessment of walking in individuals with gait disorders.", "abstract": "Walking deficits are a common bi-product of numerous neurological injuries, such as stroke and spinal cord injury. A number of new therapeutic interventions, such as body-weight supported locomotor training and robotic technologies aim to improve walking function and reduce co-morbidities. Currently, there is no way to determine what the optimal set of training parameters are for maximizing step performance. This paper presents a technique for estimating the walking performance of individuals with gait disorders using a robotic-orthosis. The device, called the Lokomat is coupled to the subject through instrumented leg cuffs, while the split-belt treadmill on which the subject walks is instrumented with piezo-electric force sensors allowing for the calculation of ground reaction forces and center of pressure. Using this data, a real-time inverse dynamics approach can be used to estimate the kinetics and kinematics of the subject, and when combined with electromyographic (EMG) data, the set of training conditions through which the subject generates the most appropriate EMG patterns and joint moments can be identified. The proposed technique will for the first time provide clinicians a way of determining the optimal gait training parameters for each individual, and also track their functional recovery throughout their neurorehabilitation program. It is postulated that training at the conditions that maximizes stepping performance will lead to higher gains in over-ground walking ability.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

The DM signal is acquired by means two surface sensors (a piezoelectric contact sensor -PCS- and a piezoelectric accelerometer -ACP) applied on the costal wall. The main objective is to develop a new non invasive technique to assess respiratory muscle effort. Experiments were performed in an animal model: four pentobarbital-anesthetized and two awake mongrel dogs, carrying out spontaneous ventilations against an inspiratory load. DM signal has been decomposed in two components: a low frequency component (lower than 5 Hz) due to the overall lateral movement of the muscle (MOV component), and a high frequency component (higher than 5 Hz) due to the lateral vibration of active muscle fibers (VIB component). It has been seen that the PCS acquires only MOV components of MD signal, while ACP acquires both components. Positive high correlation coefficients have been found between amplitude parameters of VIB components of DM signal, acquired by means the ACP, and the respiratory muscle effort during ventilation, measured with inspiratory pressures.", "journal": "Conference proceedings : ...

On the other hand, in the conventional immunoblotting assay, signal densities decreased with decreasing sample volume at the same concentration of analyte. This is caused by partial losses of the colored signal into the substrate solution by diffusion, because the fraction of loss increases with decreasing sample volume.

{"title": "Measurement of fluid viscosity at microliter volumes using quartz impedance analysis.", "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to measure viscosity of fluids at low microliter volumes by means of quartz crystal impedance analysis. To achieve this, a novel setup was designed that allowed for measurement of viscosity at volumes of 8 to 10 microL. The technique was based on the principle of electromechanical coupling of piezoelectric quartz crystals. The arrangement was simple with measurement times ranging from 2 to 3 minutes. The crystal setup assembly did not impose any unwanted initial stress on the unloaded quartz crystal. Quartz crystals of 5- and 10-MHz fundamental frequency were calibrated with glycerol-water mixtures of known density and viscosity prior to viscosity measurements. True frequency shifts, for the purpose of this work, were determined followed by viscosity measurement of aqueous solutions of sucrose, urea, PEG-400, glucose, and ethylene glycol at 25 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C. The measured viscosities were found to be reproducible and consistent with the values reported in the literature.

Besides, as expected for a viscoelastic fluid, PEG 8000 solutions, the calculated viscosities were found to be less than the reported values due to frequency dependence of storage and loss modulus components of complex viscosity.

In this paper, a nonequilibrium thermodynamic model is developed to delineate the coupled irreversible mechanical, electric, and thermal processes, which jointly contribute to dissipation. Specifically, additional nonequilibrium state variables, also known as thermodynamic fluxes, are brought in to describe each of these processes. The characteristic relaxation of these processes is modeled. The nonnegative rate of entropy production is found to be in quadratic form of thermodynamics fluxes. The energy balance equation, which governs the transformation between different energy forms, is obtained in the framework of extended irreversible thermodynamics. Using this model, the dissipation of a piezoceramic stack actuator under harmonic electric or mechanical loadings in linear operation range is studied. The harmonic-balance methods are utilized as solution techniques. In contrast to the existing piezoelectric dissipation models, the dissipation by the developed model is verified to nonlinearly depend on operating frequency, with a peak dissipation occurring at some operating frequency that is related to characteristic relaxation of irreversible processes.

The purpose of our study was to investigate frequency and amplitude dependencies of cerebral activation patterns using a vibratory stimulus that involves sensory and motor function and allows exact adjustment of vibratory frequencies and direct control of penetration depth into the tissue. Fifteen volunteers were studied with fMRI during vibratory stimulation of the right biceps muscle utilizing a block design (frequencies: 150 and 300 Hz, amplitudes: 400, 600, and 800 microm). In addition, visualization of the wave propagation into the biceps tissue itself was performed with a modified phase contrast sequence. A specially developed MR-compatible mechanical oscillator was used to apply the vibrotactile sensations. fMRI revealed activation of the left primary somatosensory cortex during application of both vibratory frequencies. Additionally, activity of the primary and supplementary motor cortex was revealed using 150-Hz stimuli, while only minimal at 300 Hz. The activity strength correlated with increasing stimulus amplitudes and the visualized penetration depth. Activation of motor areas was more pronounced at the beginning of the rest period. In conclusion, sensory motor areas can be activated using a piezoelectric actuator, with less pronounced motor area activation at higher frequencies.

Equivalent circuit parameters of piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) were obtained and discussed. The results showed that the activity of lysozyme was inhibited due to the effect of static magnetic field and the inhibitive effect becomes greater with an increase in magnetization time or magnetic field intensity. According to the response characteristics of motional resistance change (deltaR1), which is related to the change in the bacterial number, a quantitative response model reflecting the activity of lysozyme was theoretically derived. By fitting deltaR1 versus time curves under a specific magnetic field intensity but different magnetic time to the model, the relationship between K1 reflecting the activity of lysozyme and magnetic time t(m) was established. Based on the relationship, a new impedance response model that indicates the inhibitive influence of the magnetization time on the activity of lysozyme was derived as follows: deltaR1 = R0((K4(exp[K0exp(-0.26t(m))]t - 1) + 1)1/2 - 1).

{"title": "The study of devitrification processes in heavy-metal fluoride glasses.", "abstract": "Heavy-metal fluoride glasses are very promising optical fiber materials because of their predicted ultralow loss and long transparency range. Although conventional silica fibers have attained their theoretical minimum loss of 0.15 dB/km, fluoride glasses have the potential to yield losses of only 0.001 dB/km. Fluoride glasses also exhibit transparency into mid-IR frequencies, a region inaccessible to silica fibers. However, this group of glasses is very unstable to devitrification during both bulk glass synthesis and fiber-drawing. This instability has limited their commercial exploitation to a small niche market in the laser industry. The ZBLAN glass (53ZrF(4)-20BaF(2)-4LaF(3)-3AlF(3)-20NaF) is the most promising of these materials since its fiber-drawing region lies on the edge, or possibly just outside its crystallization region. It is believed that additional research into understanding the nucleation mechanics involved in the devitrification of fluoride glasses will lead to the development of technology to suppress such nucleation, or at least minimize the associated crystallization temperature region, allowing high optical quality fibers to be produced. It has recently been demonstrated that a microgravity environment can suppress devitrification in ZBLAN glass preform preparation, and that devitrification may be reduced when preparing ZBLAN terrestrially in a containerless facility. It is believed that the role of viscosity is critical in the devitrification mechanism of ZBLAN glass and in determining the optimum fiber-drawing temperature. Unfortunately, viscosity data for fluoride glasses are only available above the melting point and around the glass transition. A piezoelectric viscometer has been developed and is being used to determine the missing viscosity data in the fiber-drawing and crystallization temperature regions. Shear thinning of the glasses and/or the application of hydrostatic pressure on the glasses have been recently proposed to be responsible for devitrification during fiber-drawing at 1 g and in reduced gravity.

{"title": "Evidence of piezoelectric resonance in isolated outer hair cells.", "abstract": "Our results demonstrate high-frequency electrical resonances in outer hair cells (OHCs) exhibiting features analogous to classical piezoelectric transducers. The fundamental (first) resonance frequency averaged f(n) approximately 13 kHz (Q approximately 1.7). Higher-order resonances were also observed. To obtain these results, OHCs were positioned in a custom microchamber and subjected to stimulating electric fields along the axis of the cell (1-100 kHz, 4-16 mV/80 microm). Electrodes embedded in the side walls of the microchamber were used in a voltage-divider configuration to estimate the electrical admittance of the top portion of the cell-loaded chamber (containing the electromotile lateral wall) relative to the lower portion (containing the basal plasma membrane). This ratio exhibited resonance-like electrical tuning. Resonance was also detected independently using a secondary 1-MHz radio-frequency interrogation signal applied transversely across the cell diameter. The radio-frequency interrogation revealed changes in the transverse electric impedance modulated by the axial stimulus. Modulation of the transverse electric impedance was particularly pronounced near the resonant frequencies. OHCs used in our study were isolated from the apical region of the guinea pig cochlea, a region that responds exclusively to low-frequency acoustic stimuli. In this sense, electrical resonances we observed in vitro were at least an order of magnitude higher (ultrasonic) than the best physiological frequency of the same OHCs under acoustic stimuli in vivo.

In this technique, non-resonant multiphoton excitation is used to provide subsurface excitation of chemical constituents in a sample followed by the subsequent detection of an acoustic signal using a piezoelectric transducer. Because NMPPAS relies on non-radiative relaxation of the absorbing species, it is capable of monitoring both fluorescent and non-fluorescent species. Moreover, since the majority of the energy imparted to most molecules upon the absorption of light is released through non-radiative pathways, sensitive measurements of even fluorescent molecules can be performed. In this paper, demonstration of proof-of-principle of this novel technique has been shown using test samples of common fluorescent dyes and biomarkers including rhodamine 6G, tryptophan, and NADH in solution and gelatin tissue phantoms.

{"title": "A pi-shaped ultrasonic tweezers concept for manipulation of small particles.", "abstract": "A pi-shaped ultrasonic actuator is proposed for the noncontact trapping, extraction, and transportation of small particles. In this actuator, two metal plates clamp a multilayer piezoelectric vibrator by a small bolt, and the metal plates are tapered in their lower parts so that a vibration gradient can be obtained. The flexural vibration of the metal plates is used to generate a sound field in the gap between the two tapered metal plates. At a driving frequency of about 152.8 kHz, shrimp eggs, grass seeds, thyme seeds, rice powder, fine salt, and fine sugar, which have an average diameter from several tens of micrometers to several hundreds of micrometers, can be trapped stably without contact with the actuator, and the particles insoluble in water can be extracted from water and transported in water by the actuator. In the noncontact trapping of small particles, the positions of trapped particles as well as the relationship among the number of trapped particles, vibration velocity, and input power are investigated. The number of trapped particles increases as the vibration velocity or input power increases. However, when the vibration velocity or input power is too large, the particles may be ejected out of the actuator and, therefore, cannot be stably trapped. The minimum vibration velocity to trap small particles increases as particle density increases for the particles that have the shape near to a sphere and a proper density. In the extraction of small particles from water, the relationship between the number of extracted thyme seeds and the input power is investigated. Increasing the input power can increase the extracted thyme seeds. However, there is a maximum particle number that can be extracted from water. In the transportation of thyme seeds in water, the dependence of the particle loss during the transportation on the speed and distance of transportation and the input power is experimentally estimated. As the distance and speed of transportation increase, the particle loss during the transportation increases.

Both biochips were composed of 24 microarrays of latex beads spots (4x4) (150 microm in diameter, 800 microm spacing) entrapped in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (PDMS). The latex beads, bearing oligonucleotide sequences or capsid protein, were spotted with a conventional piezoelectric spotter and subsequently transferred at the PDMS interface. The electron microscopy observation of the biochips showed how homogeneous and well distributed the spots could be. Point mutation detection on the codon 273 of the p53 gene was performed on the basis of the melting temperature difference between the perfect match sequence and the one base pair mismatch sequence. The hybridisation of a 20-mer oligonucleotide form the codon 273 including a one base pair mutation in its sequence on a biochip arrayed with non-muted and the muted complementary sequences, enabled a clear discrimination at 56 degrees C between muted and wild sequences. Moreover, the quantitative measurement of the amount of muted sequence in a sample was possible in the range 0.4-4 pmol. Serological measurement of anti-HIV-1 p24 capsid protein on the biochip, prepared with 1-microm-diameter latex beads, enabled the detection of monoclonal antibodies in the range 1.55-775 ng mL(-1). Such a range could be lowered to 0.775 ng mL(-1) when using 50-nm-diameter beads, which generated a higher specific surface. The validation of the biochip for the detection of anti-HIV-1 capsid protein antibodies was performed in human sera from seropositive and seronegative patients.

{"title": "AlphaA-crystallin interacting regions in the small heat shock protein, alphaB-crystallin.", "abstract": "Amino acid sequences of alphaB-crystallin, involved in interaction with alphaA-crystallin, were determined by using peptide scans. Positionally addressable 20-mer overlapping peptides, representing the entire sequence of alphaB-crystallin, were synthesized on a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with albumin and incubated with purified alphaA-crystallin. Probing the membrane with alphaA-crystallin-specific antibodies revealed residues 42-57, 60-71, and 88-123 in alphaB-crystallin to interact with alphaA-crystallin. Residues 42-57 and 60-71 interacted more strongly with alphaA-crystallin than the 88-123 sequence of alphaB-crystallin. Binding of one of the alphaB peptides (42-57) to alphaA-crystallin was also confirmed by gel filtration studies and HPLC analysis. The alphaB-crystallin sequences involved in interaction with alphaA-crystallin were distinct from the chaperone sites reported earlier as binding of the alphaB sequence from residues 42-57 does not alter the chaperone-like function of alphaA-crystallin. To identify the critical residues involved in interaction with alphaA-crystallin, R50G and P51A mutants of alphaB-crystallin were made and tested for their ability to interact with alphaA-crystallin. The oligomeric size and hydrophobicity of the mutants were similar. Circular dichroism studies showed that the P51A mutation increased the alpha-helical content of the protein. While the alphaBR50G mutant showed chaperone-like activity similar to wild-type alphaB, alphaBP51A showed reduced chaperone function. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies showed that the P51A mutation decreased the rate of subunit exchange with alphaA by 63%, whereas the R50G mutation reduced the exchange rate by 23%. Similar to wild-type alphaB, alphaB-crystallin peptide (42-57) effectively competed with alphaBP51A and alphaBR50G for interaction with alphaA.

Endoscopic mucosal resection has proved an effective technique for treating early mucosal gastrointestinal cancer. However, resecting a lesion larger than 2\u2009cm en bloc requires special devices and a long processing time; and it engenders the risk of bleeding, perforation, and other complications.\nWe investigated application of the CUSA for detaching the mucosa from the muscularis propria of extracted porcine stomachs and then clarified the specification of an endoscopic ultrasonic scalpel for endoscopic mucosal resection by investigating characteristics of two original, handmade prototype cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirators.\nUse of a cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator should improve the ease and safety of detaching the mucosa. A small, high-power ultrasonic cylindrical vibrator should be developed to make possible a probe-type scalpel with a piezoelectric vibrator mounted in the tip of a catheter. An ultrasonic transmission-type scalpel could lead to the development of a new endoscopic mucosal resection device for clinical use.\nThe CUSA should enable us to develop a safer, simpler, time-saving scalpel for endoscopic mucosal resection, although some resolvable technical problems remain.

Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LPCM are highly nonlinear and time varying, an adaptive hybrid control system is therefore designed based on a hypothetical dynamic model to achieve high-precision position control. The architecture of DRCMAC network is a modified model of a cerebellar-model-articulation-computer (CMAC) network to attain a small number of receptive-fields. The novel idea of this study is that it employs the concept of diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN) in order to capture the system dynamics and convert the static CMAC into a dynamic one. This adaptive hybrid control system is composed of two parts. One is a DRCMAC network controller that is used to mimic a conventional computed torque control law due to unknown system dynamics, and the other is a compensated controller with bound estimation algorithm that is utilized to recover the residual approximation error for guaranteeing the stable characteristic. The effectiveness of the proposed driving circuit and control system is verified with hardware experiments under the occurrence of uncertainties.

In this prospective animal study, a piezoelectric bimorph was implanted into 2 guinea pigs and 1 dog between the skull bone and the dura at the parietal area. The bimorph was connected transdermally by wires to a click generator. The auditory brain stem response was recorded after stimulation of the piezoelectric device by the click generator. In the 3 animals, the auditory brain stem response could be recorded in response to a stimulus intensity of 135 dB peak equivalent (pe) sound pressure level (SPL; instrument setting), corresponding to 3.8 V activating the device. The auditory brain stem response disappeared during white noise masking, proving that the origin of the response was in the inner ear. The threshold was 125 and 115 dB pe SPL in the 2 guinea pigs and 135 dB pe SPL in the dog (instrument setting). We conclude that transmission of sound waves by a cerebrospinal fluid hydroacoustic pathway to the inner ear is possible.

Piezoelectric sensors coupled with the pentapeptides as biomimetic traps (the receptors), selective for the dioxins, were used for the realisation of this analytical system. A methodology to select specific receptors among all possible pentapeptides randomly generated was represented by the use of molecular modelling software. Three peptides called later on A, B and C (A:[N]Asn-Phe-Gln-Gly-Ile[C]; B:[N]Asn-Phe-Gln-Gly-Gln[C]; C:[N]Asn-Phe-Gln-Gly-Phe[C]), were selected and evaluated for their potential usage as artificial receptors in solid-gas analysis by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors array.

It is demonstrated that the electric load impedance can change the resonance frequency, the antiresonance frequency, and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient.

The model developed was capable of predicting the true pressure-time waveforms at virtually any point in the field. The input to the model used pressure amplitude data measured in the immediate vicinity of the acoustic source or transducer considered. The experimental verification of the model was obtained using a commercially available, 8 MHz, dynamically focused linear array and a single element, 5 MHz, focused rectangular source. The verification was performed at low and high excitation levels, corresponding to linear and nonlinear acoustic wave propagation, respectively. The pressure-time waveforms were recorded using piezoelectric polymer hydrophone probes that had different sensitivities, frequency responses, bandwidths, and active element diameters. The nominal diameters of the probes ranged from 50 to 500 microm, and their useable bandwidths varied between 55 and 100 MHz. The PII, used to calculate the thermal index (TI), was found to increase with increasing bandwidth and decreasing effective aperture of the probes. The MI, another safety indicator, also was affected, but to a lesser extent. The corrections predicted using the model were used to reduce discrepancies as large as 30% in the determination of PII. The results of this work indicate that, by accounting for hydrophones' finite aperture and correcting the value of PII, all intensities derived from the PII can be corrected for spatial averaging error. The results also point out that caution should be exercised when comparing acoustic output data.

{"title": "Effect of occlusal morphology on the accuracy of bite force measurements using thin film transducers.", "abstract": "Occlusal transducer foils using piezoelectricity or pressure-dependent electric resistance are potential candidates for a measurement system for both absolute levels and changes in bite force. This preliminary in vitro study evaluated the possible usefulness of such transducer foils in the assessment of occlusal forces in centric occlusion.\nPiezoelectric force transducer foils 33 microm thick were placed between pairs of teeth with the dentition in centric occlusion. Occlusal forces were recorded in five patients, who were instructed to bite as hard as possible for about 1 second. Acrylic resin casts of each pair of antagonistic teeth were aligned with the help of interocclusal records. The casts were mounted in a jig, where a defined load could be applied. The ratio of applied force and measured sensor signal permitted a set of calibration factors.\nA correction factor for each pair of teeth helped determine the ratio by which measured occlusal force exceeded actual tooth load. Differences in occlusal morphology gave rise to a wide span of correction factors (1.01 to 2.80). Steep cusp angles resulted in a wedge action that gave rise to a strong increase in occlusal forces, which were about twice as high as actual tooth load, with wide variation.\nThis method of bite force measurement eliminated the influence of occlusal morphology by individual correction for each pair of opposing teeth. To measure the absolute load of antagonistic teeth with thin film transducer foils, one must take into account individual occlusal morphology. Forces measured with the films are a function of both actual tooth load and occlusal morphology.", "journal": "The International journal of prosthodontics", "date": "2004-11-17", "authors": ["KurtRottner", "Ernst-J\u00fcrgenRichter"], "doi": null}

First, a single unit ellipsoidal reflector insert was used to modify the profile of lithotriptor shock wave (LSW) to decrease the propensity of tissue injury in SWL. Second, a piezoelectric annular array (PEAA) generator (f = 230 kHz and F = 150 mm) was used to produce an auxiliary shock wave of approximately 13 MPa in peak pressure (at 4 kV output voltage) to intensify the collapse of LSW induced bubbles near the target stone for improved comminution efficiency.\nConsistent rupture of a vessel phantom made of single cellulose hollow fiber (i.d. = 0.2 mm) was produced after 30 shocks by the original HM-3 reflector at 20 kV. In comparison no vessel rupture could be produced after 200 shocks using the upgraded reflector at 22 kV or the PEAA generator at 4 kV. Using cylindrical BegoStone phantoms (Bego USA, Smithfield, Rhode Island) stone comminution efficiencies (mean +/- sd) after 1,500 shocks produced by the original and upgraded HM-3 reflectors, and the combined PEAA/upgraded HM-3 system, were 81.3% +/- 3.5%, 90.1% +/- 4.3% and 95.2% +/- 3.3%, respectively (p<0.05).\nOptimization of the pulse profile and sequence of LSW can significantly improve stone comminution while simultaneously decreasing the propensity of tissue injury during in vitro SWL.

{"title": "Multi-frequency harmonic arrays: initial experience with a novel transducer concept for nonlinear contrast imaging.", "abstract": "Nonlinear contrast imaging modes such as second harmonic imaging (HI) and subharmonic imaging (SHI) are increasingly important for clinical applications. However, the performance of currently available transducers for HI and SHI is significantly constrained by their limited bandwidth. To bypass this constraint, a novel transducer concept termed multi-frequency harmonic transducer arrays (MFHA's) has been designed and a preliminary evaluation has been conducted. The MFHA may ultimately be used for broadband contrast enhanced HI and SHI with high dynamic range and consists of three multi-element piezo-composite sub-arrays (A-C) constructed so the center frequencies are 4f(A) = 2f(B) = f(C) (specifically 2.5/5.0/10.0 MHz and 1.75/3.5/7.0 MHz). In principle this enables SHI by transmitting on sub-array C receiving on B and, similarly, from B to A as well as HI by transmitting on A receiving on B and, likewise, from B to C. Initially transmit and receive pressure levels of the arrays were measured with the elements of each sub-array wired in parallel. Following contrast administration, preliminary in vitro HI and SHI signal-to-noise ratios of up to 40 dB were obtained. In conclusion, initial design and in vitro characterization of two MFHA's have been performed. They have an overall broad frequency bandwidth of at least two octaves. Due to the special design of the array assembly, the SNR for HI and SHI was comparable to that of regular B-mode and better than commercially available HI systems.

{"title": "Amplified detection of telomerase activity using electrochemical and quartz crystal microbalance measurements.", "abstract": "Telomerase is considered as an important biomarker for cancer cells. Two different methods for the amplified electrochemical and microgravimetric quartz-crystal-microbalance detection of telomerase activity originating from HeLa cancer cells are described. One method involves the telomerization of a primer (1) linked to the electrode, in the presence of telomerase from HeLa cell extract and dNTP, followed by the hybridization of a biotin-labeled nucleic acid (2) that is complementary to the telomere repeat units. The subsequent binding of an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (3) that catalyzes the oxidative hydrolysis of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (4) results in the precipitation of the insoluble product (5) on the electrode. The second method involves the telomerization of the primer (1) associated with the electrode, in the presence of the telomerase-containing HeLa cell extract and the dNTP nucleotide mixture that includes biotin-labeled dUTP. The telomerization leads to the labeling of the telomeres with biotin labels. The association of the avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (3) to the biotin labels results in the biocatalyzed transformation of (4) to (5) and the formation of a precipitate on the electrode or the Au-quartz crystal. As numerous precipitate molecules are formed as a result of the formation of a single telomere, the methods represent routes for the amplified detection of telomerase activity. The formation of the precipitate on the respective transducers is probed by following the changes in the electrode resistance using chronopotentiometry, or by following the frequency changes of the piezoelectric quartz crystals. The amount of precipitate generated on the electrodes is controlled by the concentration of the HeLa cancer cells. The methods enable the detection of telomerase activity that is extracted from 1000 HeLa cancer cells.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2004-11-09", "authors": ["ValeriPavlov", "ItamarWillner", "ArnonDishon", "MosheKotler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2004.06.020"}

We demonstrate for the first time that l-DOPA (levodopa) can be biosynthetically incorporated into cell proteins by human cells (THP-1 monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages). The DOPA-containing proteins generated were selectively visualized on PVDF membranes using a redox-cycling staining method. Many cell proteins contained DOPA and seemed to be synthesized as their full-length forms. The cellular removal of DOPA-containing proteins by THP-1 cells was by proteolysis involving both the proteasomal and the lysosomal systems. The rate of cellular proteolysis of DOPA-containing proteins increased at lower levels of DOPA incorporation but decreased at higher levels of DOPA incorporation. The decreased rate of degradation was accompanied by an increase in the activity of cathepsins B and L but the activity of cathepsin S increased only at lower levels of DOPA incorporation.

Therefore, the thickness of the Hb-QHQ-POAP film was estimated as about 104 +/- 10 nm by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The QHQ mediation effects on the biomacromolecule Hb entrapped in the POAP film were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, amperometric technique and kinetic study. Cyclic voltammograms showed that the redox peaks in the Hb-QHQ-POAP film are much more reversible than those in the Hb-POAP film. The response current of the Hb-QHQ-POAP film to H(2)O(2) was almost twice than that of the Hb-POAP film. The Michaelis-Menten constant and the activation energy of Hb in the Hb-QHQ-POAP film are 7.47 mM and 13.91 kJ/mol, respectively, both are smaller than that in the Hb-POAP film.

Two different genetically engineered mutant proteins were utilized, each involving the incorporation of a single cysteine into the amino acid sequence of the protein. The proteins were immobilized on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal by a direct sulfur-gold linkage. Since the cysteines were located at different positions in the sequence, the receptors attach to the surface with different orientations. Considering only mass effects, the target sugars for this receptor are predicted to be too small to be detectable with a QCM. However, our sensors indicated measurable and reproducible frequency responses when immobilized receptor was exposed to sugar. This unexpectedly large frequency response occurs because the protein film is transformed from a viscous layer to a more rigid nondissipative film. The QCM can detect these changes because of the direct linkage of the proteins to the surface. Calculations of the frequency response expected for a viscoelastic film with different rheological characteristics support this hypothesis. This study is significant because it illustrates a widened applicability for the QCM methodology to protein systems that bind small molecules and undergo ligand-induced conformational changes.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "date": "2004-11-03", "authors": ["Kendra SCarmon", "Ruth EBaltus", "Linda ALuck"], "doi": "10.1021/bi0484623"}

Although there has been a concerted effort to develop lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, no effective alternative to PZT has yet been found. Here we report a lead-free piezoelectric ceramic with an electric-field-induced strain comparable to typical actuator-grade PZT.

For the eccentric isokinetic muscle actions, the relationships for MMG amplitude (r2 = 0.580) and MPF (r2 = 0.961) versus torque were also linear.\nThe patterns for MMG amplitude and MPF may reflect the motor control strategies that modulate torque production for isometric and eccentric isokinetic muscle actions. Based on the results of this and previous studies, it appears that for the vastus medialis, torque is modulated in a similar manner for isometric, concentric, and eccentric isokinetic muscle actions.

However, the molecular determinants for the proton-sensitive gating of NMDA receptors are still not clearly delineated. The highly conserved lurcher motif plays an important role in determining the proton sensitivity of NMDA receptors. Mutations of several residues in the lurcher motif of either NR1 or NR2A significantly reduce proton sensitivity of recombinant NR1/NR2A receptors. It remains uncertain how these residues play a role in proton inhibition of NMDA receptors. Mutations of these residues could directly reduce the proton affinity. Alternatively, they could alter the proton IC(50) indirectly by increasing channel open probability. In the present study, we recorded the macroscopic NMDA currents in HEK 293 cells with a piezo-based rapid solution exchange system. We show that zinc slows the deactivation of NR1a(A653T)/NR2A receptors and NR1a/NR2A(A651T) receptors. However, NR1a(T648C)/NR2A, NR1a/NR2A(T646C), NR1a(A649C)/NR2A, NR1a/NR2A(A647C), and NR1a(A653T)/NR2A exhibit significantly slower rise time and deactivation time constants under nominally zinc-free conditions. Our data suggest that the channel open probability for these mutant receptors may be significantly increased. The reduction in proton sensitivity by these mutations could be accounted for, at least partially, by the increased channel open probability. In contrast, NR1a/NR2A(A651T) exhibits normal macroscopic currents, suggesting that the reduction of proton sensitivity by this mutation cannot be attributed to any significant change of open probability.

{"title": "Abnormal cardiac wall motion and early matrix metalloproteinase activity.", "abstract": "Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the heart is known to facilitate cardiac remodeling and progression to failure. We hypothesized that regional dyskinetic wall motion of the left ventricle would stimulate activation of MMPs. Abnormal wall motion at a target site on the anterior lateral wall of the left ventricle was induced by pacing atrial and ventricular sites of five open-chest anesthetized dogs. Changes in shortening at the left ventricular (LV) pacing site and at a remote site at the anterior base of the left ventricle were monitored with piezoelectric crystals. Simultaneous atrial and ventricular pacing resulted in abnormal motion at the LV pacing site, yielding early shortening and late systolic lengthening, whereas the shortening pattern at the remote site remained unaffected. Assessment of global myocardial MMP activity showed a sevenfold increase in substrate cleavage (P < 0.02) at the LV pacing site relative to the remote site. Gelatin zymography revealed increases in 92-kDa MMP-9 activity and 86-kDa MMP-9 activity at the LV pacing site relative to the remote site, whereas MMP-2 activity was unaffected. Abnormal wall motion was associated with increases in collagen degradation (approximately 2-fold; P < 0.03), plasmin activity (approximately 1.5-fold; P < 0.05), nitrotyrosine levels (approximately 20-fold; P = 0.05), and inflammatory infiltrate (approximately 2-fold; P < 0.02) relative to the remote site. Results indicate that regional dyskinesis induced by epicardial activation is sufficient to stimulate significant MMP activity in the heart, suggesting that abnormal wall motion is a stimulus for MMP activation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "A membrane bioreactor for the removal of dimethyl sulphide and toluene from waste air.", "abstract": "In biotrickling filters, mass transfer of hydrophobic compounds is the limiting factor. Biofilters are static systems, and so control and regulation of operational parameters such as pH and nutrient supply can be a problem. In membrane bioreactors, these drawbacks can be avoided. The hydrophobic membrane separates the waste air from the aqueous phase, thus avoiding mass-transfer limitation, while pH and nutrient supply can be directly controlled. In this contribution, an overview will be given of results obtained during a four-year project. First, the physical chemical characteristics (solubility, permeability, diffusivity) and microbial adhesion of different membranes were tested. This led to the selection of a composite membrane consisting of a porous polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) support layer coated with a thin (1 or 2.5 microm) dense polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) top layer. This membrane was mounted into a module provided with four parallel rectangular channels for gas flow (in contact with the porous layer) and nutrient solution (in contact with the dense layer) respectively. After inoculation, a biofilm developed on the dense layer. Experiments were performed with dimethyl sulphide and toluene as target VOCs. Operational characteristics such as elimination capacity as a function of the volumetric load and residence time, effect of nutrient supply, long-term performance) were determined.

{"title": "Modeling of wave propagation in layered piezoelectric media by a recursive asymptotic method.", "abstract": "In this paper, a simple asymptotic method to compute wave propagation in a multilayered general anisotropic piezoelectric medium is discussed. The method is based on explicit second and higher order asymptotic representations of the transfer and stiffness matrices for a thin piezoelectric layer. Different orders of the asymptotic expansion are obtained using Pad\u00e9 approximation of the transfer matrix exponent. The total transfer and stiffness matrices for thick layers or multilayers are calculated with high precision by subdividing them into thin sublayers and combining recursively the thin layer transfer and stiffness matrices. The rate of convergence to the exact solution is the same for both transfer and stiffness matrices; however, it is shown that the growth rate of the round-off error with the number of recursive operations for the stiffness matrix is twice that for the transfer matrix; and the stiffness matrix method has better performance for a thick layer. To combine the advantages of both methods, a hybrid method which uses the transfer matrix for the thin layer and the stiffness matrix for the thick layer is proposed. It is shown that the hybrid method has the same stability as the stiffness matrix method and the same round-off error as the transfer matrix method. The method converges to the exact transfer/stiffness matrices essentially with the precision of the computer round-off error. To apply the method to a semispace substrate, the substrate was replaced by an artificial perfect matching layer. The computational results for such an equivalent system are identical with those for the actual system. In our computational experiments, we have found that the advantage of the asymptotic method is its simplicity and efficiency.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2004-10-14", "authors": ["LugenWang", "Stanislav IRokhlin"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2004.1334839"}

Termed wall-less sample preparation (WaSP), this methodology offers several features that could prove beneficial to the preparation of sample spots from separation column effluents for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis. These features include solute pre-concentration factors of 10(1) to 10(3) due to volatile solvent evaporation prior to droplet deposition onto the target plate, high spatial accuracy of the deposition position of each processed droplet (+/-5 microm), and the ability to prepare sample spots as small as 20 microm in diameter from a single droplet. Here a new mode of operation of this methodology is described and used as an offline post-column pre-concentrating interface between capillary liquid chromatography (capLC) and a target plate for offline MALDI-MS. Using a fraction from the capLC separation of peptides produced by the proteolytic digestion of the protein cytidine 5'-triphosphate:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, MALDI sample spots were prepared using the dried-droplet method, direct piezoelectric droplet dispensing, and the processing of piezo-dispensed droplets by WaSP. The sample spot morphology was investigated using light microscopy, and peptide ion abundances produced by MALDI were measured using time-of-flight (TOF) MS.

{"title": "High-throughput, fluorescence-based screening for soluble protein expression.", "abstract": "Protein expression screening methods are essential for proteomic scale characterization of gene and cDNA expression libraries. Screening methods are also important for the identification of highly expressed protein targets, for example, in quantities suitable for high-throughput screening and protein structural studies. To address these needs, we describe the implementation of several rapid, fluorescence-based protein expression screening strategies using Escherichia coli or E. coli-based in vitro transcription/translation (IVT) systems. In vitro expression screening is fast, convenient and, as we show, correlates well with in vivo expression. For screening, expressed proteins are labeled either as fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or through translational incorporation of a fluorescent amino acid derivative, BODIPY-FL-Lysine. Fluorescence-based detection of GFP fusions or BODIPY-labeled proteins is considerably faster than other common expression screening methods, such as immunological detection of gels or dot blots. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo screening used together yield a larger set of expressed proteins than either method alone. Specifically labeled proteins in cellular lysates are detected in one of three formats: a microplate using a fluorescence plate reader, a dot-blot using a fluorescence scanner or a microarray using a laser scanner. We have established a correlation among the various detection formats, which validates the use of protein microarrays for expression screening. Production of expressed proteins detected through screening can be scaled up either using IVT reactions or with in vivo expression systems in the absence of a fluorophore for subsequent characterization of protein function or interactions.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2004-10-12", "authors": ["M AColeman", "V HLao", "B WSegelke", "P TBeernink"], "doi": "10.1021/pr049912g"}

The sperms were injected into mouse oocytes by a piezo-micromanipulator, and some of these oocytes were artificially activated with strontium chloride (SrCl2) after ICSI. The oocytes were fixed, stained, and subjected to chromosomal analysis. The survival rate of mouse oocytes injected with infertile human sperms was 92.0% (46/50), while that of the control mouse oocytes injected with fertile human sperms was 73.6% (81/110). The rate of two pronuclei (2PN) formation was 0 (0/46) by the infertile sperms and 81.5% (66/81) by the fertile ones, a significant difference (p < 0.01). Sperm chromosomes in non-activated oocytes were present as premature chromosome condensation (PCC). Artificial activation after ICSI increased the 2PN formation rate in the infertile group to 90.3% (28/31). The results of the present study suggest that infertile sperms have a low potential to spontaneously activate oocytes and to form pronuclei.

In the DIU-AFM, two AFM units were combined, one as a reference unit, and the other a test one. Their probes with Z piezo elements and tips were horizontally set in parallel at the same height to reduce errors due to geometric asymmetry. An XY scanner was attached to an XY block that was able to move in the X direction with a step of about 500 nm. A standard porous alumina film was employed as the reference sample. Both reference sample and test sample were installed at the center of the XY scanner on the same surface and were simultaneously imaged. The two images had the same lateral size, and thus the length of the test sample image could be accurately measured by counting the number of periodic features of the reference one. The XY block together with the XY scanner were next moved in the X direction for about 1.5 microm and a second pair of reference and test images were obtained by activating the scanner. In this way, a series of pairs of images were acquired and could be spliced into two wide-range reference and test images, respectively. Again, the two spliced images were of the same size and the length of test image was measured based on the reference one. This article presents a discussion about the structure and control of the DIU-AFM system.

Preliminary results indicate a correlation between the electromechanical impedance spectrum of the bio-PWAS and the state of implantation. Quantitative studies have shown that the first radial mode amplitude seems to correlate with the short-time inflammatory and immune response, while the thickness mode amplitude seems to correlate with both the short-term inflammatory response and long-term encapsulation and fibrosis response. Since radial vibrations generate shear waves in the surrounding tissue, while thickness vibrations generate pressure waves, it seems that the shear and pressure wave interactions have specificity in detecting the different stages of the body's reaction response to implants. These observations were supported by histological examinations of the tissue surrounding the bio-PWAS. Though these initial results are encouraging, further experiments need to be conducted and more data needs to be collected in correlation with histological determinations. In-depth impedance spectroscopy studies should be conducted on this extensive data and closely correlated with extensive histological studies.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["VictorGiurgiutiu", "HaroldFriedman", "JonathanBender", "ThomasBorg", "MichaelYost", "WilliamNewcomb", "AmandaBlack", "JoelBost", "ChristopherStewart"], "doi": "10.1080/08941930490502835"}

The method is used to measure the electrophoretic mobility of PMMA particles (diameter 10 microm) suspended in a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons. The particle volume fraction of the suspension is varied from 0 up to 0.30 and the resulting variation of the electrophoretic mobility is discussed. The suspending liquid is such that its refractive index is very close to that of the particles. Thus the suspension is almost transparent and it is possible to follow through a microscope the motion of one particle. The suspension is subjected to a low-frequency electric field (0.5 Hz). The cell containing the suspension is mounted on a piezoelectric crystal. The displacement that compensates for the particle motion (when the particle image is steady) is determined.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2004-09-24", "authors": ["Alberto TP\u00e9rez", "ElisabethLemaire"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2004.06.026"}

This adaptive CMAC-based supervisory control system consists of an adaptive CMAC and a supervisory controller. In the adaptive CMAC, a CMAC is used to mimic an ideal control law and a compensated controller is designed to recover the residual of the approximation error. The supervisory controller is appended to the adaptive CMAC to force the system states within a predefined constraint set. In this design, if the adaptive CMAC can maintain the system states within the constraint set, the supervisory controller will be idle. Otherwise, the supervisory controller starts working to pull the states back to the constraint set. In addition, the adaptive laws of the control system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov function, so that the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Furthermore, to relax the requirement of approximation error bound, an estimation law is derived to estimate the error bound. Finally, the proposed control system is applied to control a robotic manipulator, a chaotic circuit and a linear piezoelectric ceramic motor (LPCM).

{"title": "Multimode shunt damping of piezoelectric smart panel for noise reduction.", "abstract": "Multimode shunt damping of piezoelectric smart panel is studied for noise reduction. Piezoelectric smart panel is a plate structure on which a piezoelectric patch is attached with an electrical shunt circuit. When an incidence sound is impinged on the panel structure, the structure vibrates and the attached piezoelectric patch produces an electrical energy, which can be effectively dissipated as heat via the electrical shunt circuit. Since the energy dissipation strongly depends on the vibration mode of the panel structure, many patches are required for multiple vibration modes. Instead of using multiple piezoelectric patches, a single piezoelectric patch is used in conjunction with a blocked shunt circuit for multimode shunt damping. Modeling, shunt parameter tuning, and implementation of the blocked shunt circuit along with an acoustic test of the panel are explained. A remarkable reduction of the transmitted noise was achieved for multiple modes of the panel. Since this technology has many merits in terms of compactness, low cost, robustness, and ease of installation, practical applications in many noise problems can be anticipated.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2004-09-21", "authors": ["JaehwanKim", "Joon-HyoungKim"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1768947"}

{"title": "Measurement of meniscofemoral contact pressure after repair of bucket-handle tears with biodegradable implants.", "abstract": "Biodegradable implants are frequently used for meniscus repair. Articular cartilage damage has been reported recently after meniscus repair with biodegradable implants. The aim of the study was to investigate the meniscofemoral contact pressure at the posterior horn of the medial and lateral meniscus after repair of bucket-handle lacerations.\nSpecimens were mounted in a materials testing machine (Bionix 858, MTS) which was equipped with a load cell. The quadriceps tendon was attached to a hydraulic cylinder, and knee motion was controlled via tension of the quadriceps tendon. A piezo-resistive system (Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) measured the meniscofemoral contact pressure. Five different types of biodegradable implants (Arrow, Dart, Fastener, Stinger and Meniscal Screw) and horizontal suture (no. 2 Ethibond) were tested. The knee was extended from 90 degrees of flexion to 0 degrees under a constant load of 350 N due to adjustment of the tension force of the quadriceps tendon. The femorotibial pressure and contact area were recorded at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion.\nThe meniscofemoral pressure did not increase after meniscus repair with biodegradable implants or sutures. The meniscofemoral peak pressure at the posterior horn was 1.46+/-1.54 MPa in the medial compartment and 1.08+/-1.17 MPa in the lateral compartment at full knee extension. The meniscofemoral pressure increased significantly in both compartments with knee flexion from 0 degree to 90 degrees.\nBiodegradable implants for meniscus repair do not affect the meniscofemoral pressure. However, there remains a risk of damage to the cartilage when barbed implants are used. If the implant is not entirely advanced into the meniscus, the sharp head or some of the barbs at the column of the implant may come into direct contact with the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau.

The present study was designed to test whether the use of piezoelectric contact (non-invasive) sensors could be useful in respiratory monitoring, in particular in measuring the timing of diaphragmatic contraction.\nExperiments were performed in an animal model: three pentobarbital anesthetized mongrel dogs. The motion of the thoracic cage was acquired by means of a piezoelectric contact sensor placed on the costal wall. This signal is compared with direct measurements of the diaphragmatic muscle length, made by sonomicrometry. Furthermore, to assess the diaphragmatic function other respiratory signals were acquired: respiratory airflow and transdiaphragmatic pressure. Diaphragm contraction time was estimated with these four signals. Using diaphragm length signal as reference, contraction times estimated with the other three signals were compared with the contraction time estimated with diaphragm length signal.\nThe contraction time estimated with the TM signal tends to give a reading 0.06 seconds lower than the measure made with the DL signal (-0.21 and 0.00 for FL and DP signals, respectively), with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds (0.08 and 0.06 for FL and DP signals, respectively).

In general, correlation coefficients and mean and standard deviation of the difference were better in the inspiratory load respiratory test than in spontaneous ventilation tests.\nThe technique presented in this work provides a non-invasive method to assess the timing of diaphragmatic contraction in canines, using a piezoelectric contact sensor placed on the costal wall.", "journal": "BMC pulmonary medicine", "date": "2004-09-10", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 AntonioFiz", "RaimonJan\u00e9", "AbelTorres", "JosepMorera", "BatxiGaldiz", "Joaqu\u00ednGea", "AlejandroGrassino"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2466-4-8"}

In this study, one full electrode design and three nonsymmetrical partial electrode designs of piezoelectric disks are investigated. Because the clear fringe patterns measured by the AF-ESPI method will be shown only at resonant frequencies, both the resonant frequencies and the corresponding vibration mode shapes are successfully obtained at the same time for out-of-plane and in-plane motions. The second experimental method is the impedance analysis, which is used to measure the resonant and antiresonant frequencies. In addition to these experimental methods, LDV-DSA is used to determine the resonant frequencies of the vibration mode with out-of-plane motion. From the experimental results, the dependence of electrode design on the vibration frequencies and mode shapes is addressed. Numerical computations based on the finite element method are presented, and the results are compared with the experimental measurements.

Recently, a new technology has become available, the Neurovent-P (Raumedic AG + CO, Raumedic, Germany). As a pre-requisite for a clinical trial, we have conducted and report on bench test studies to confirm the manufacturer's long term zero-drift performance for this technology.\nIn a test rig static tests (recording of 20 mmHg pressure) and dynamic tests, ranging from 5 to 50 mmHg have been performed.\n10 ICP probes have been tested for a total of 60 days. All the catheters, after the connection with the ICU monitor displayed a static pressure of 0 +/- 1 mmHg and did not required pre-insertion alteration. At five days, mean zero drift was 0.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg. Overall, zero drift ranged from 0 to 2 mmHg. At a fixed static pressure of 20 mmHg, the mean recorded value was 20.6 +/- 0.8 mmHg, ranging from 19 to 23 mmHg. A regression analysis of the relationship between the applied pressure and the recorded pressure during the dynamic tests of the 10 catheters yielded a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.997.

Our overall aim was to evaluate an automated system of OMT signal analysis in a diverse patient population undergoing general anesthesia. In a multicenter trial involving four centers in three countries, we examined the accuracy of OMT to identify the unconscious state and to predict movement in response to airway instrumentation and surgical stimulation. We also tested the effects of neuromuscular blockade and patient position on OMT. We measured OMT continuously by using the closed-eye piezoelectric technique in 214 patients undergoing extracranial surgery with general anesthesia using a variety of anesthetics. OMT decreased at induction in all patients, increased transiently in response to surgical incision or airway instrumentation, and increased at emergence. The frequency of OMT predicted movement in response to laryngeal mask airway insertion and response to command at emergence. Neuromuscular blockade did not affect the frequency of OMT but decreased its amplitude. OMT frequency was unaffected by changes in patient position.

{"title": "Detection and quantification of protein residues in food grade amino acids and nucleic acids using a dot-blot fluorescent staining method.", "abstract": "Food allergies represent an important health problem in industrialized countries, such that detection and quantitative analysis of the protein considered to be the main allergen is crucial. A dot-blot fluorescent staining method for the detection and quantitative analysis of protein residues in food grade amino acids and nucleic acids is presented. This method combines fluorescence staining with dot-blotting onto PVDF membrane. Several standard proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), lysozyme (14 kDa), ubiquitin (8.6 kDa), bovine insulin (5.7 kDa), and oxidized insulin B chain (3.5 kDa), were detectable at 0.1 ppm using SYPRO Ruby blot stain. Twenty-five different amino acids and two different nucleic acids of food grade were analyzed using this method combined with an internal standard addition method using BSA as an internal standard. All amino acids and nucleic acids were dissolved in 3.6% aqueous HCl and dot-blotted onto PVDF membrane before a large amount of amino acids and nucleic acid were removed. Protein residues and the internal standard protein immobilized on the membrane were stained using SYPRO ruby blot stain. The internal standard in all samples was detectable at 0.1 ppm. Samples were dissolved at 120 or 70 mg/mL, according to their solubility under acidic conditions. The detection limit of protein residues per weight was 0.8-1.4 ppm in amino acids and nucleic acids; residual protein was not detected in any sample.", "journal": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "date": "2004-08-19", "authors": ["NaoyukiYamada", "ShinichiOzawa", "NaokoKageyama", "HiroshiMiyano"], "doi": "10.1021/jf0496696"}

The reservoir contained the agent in solution in the solvent 1-octanol or its dispersion/solution in the solvent mineral oil with or without an enhancer. The porous membranes employed with water-in-pores were hydrophobic Celgard 2400 of polypropylene and hydrophilized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Conventional Franz diffusion cells as well as a skin patch were used. The transport rates of the agent observed through both Celgard and PVDF membranes could be successfully described by Fickian diffusion through the water-filled pores when the appropriate organic-aqueous partition coefficient was incorporated. The light mineral oil-based system yielded much higher permeability due to the much lower organic-aqueous partition coefficient of the antibiotic in light mineral oil. The optimized skin patch systems yielded drug flux and permeability values similar to their relevant membrane systems. The addition of a mouse skin beneath the patch drastically reduced the drug transfer rate. Among a number of enhancers used to correct this deficiency, linoleic acid at 10% level in the reservoir solution was found to yield a flux of 2.7 +/- 0.5 microg/cm(2) h and a permeability of 2.7e - 04 +/- 5.0e - 05 cm/h.

Here, a further test carried out at the SPring-8 1 km beamline BL29XUL is reported. One of the BBB's mirrors was displaced by a piezo to introduce the required path-length difference. The resulting variation of intensity with piezo voltage as measured by an avalanche photodiode could be ascribed to the phase variation resulting from the path-length change, with a small additional contribution from the change of the position of the lattice planes of the front mirror relative to the rest of the crystal. This 'Michelson fringe' interpretation is supported by the observed steady movement across the output beam of the interference fringes produced by a refractive wedge when the piezo voltage was ramped. The front-mirror displacement required for one complete fringe at the given wavelength is only 0.675 A; therefore, a quiet environment is vital for operating this device, as previous experiments have shown.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2004-08-18", "authors": ["John PSutter", "TetsuyaIshikawa", "UlrichKuetgens", "GerhardMaterlik", "YoshinoriNishino", "ArmenRostomyan", "KenjiTamasaku", "MakinaYabashi"], "doi": "10.1107/S0909049504015468"}

{"title": "Generation of higher pressure pulses at the surface of piezo-composite materials using electrical pre-strain.", "abstract": "New clinical concepts in lithotripsy demand smaller shock heads. Reducing the size of piezoelectric shock heads requires increasing the surface pressure of each transducer so that the total pressure at the focus remains the same. A new method allowing generation of large surface pressures is described. The hypothesis is that piezoelectric plots in piezo-composite material are more fragile in extension than in compression. For this reason, actuators are mechanically prestressed between two flasks. This method cannot be used for transducers working at high frequencies, such as 0.5 MHz. So we tried to electrically prestrain compressively the piezoelectric material by applying a high-electrical field in the opposite direction of polarization. Three protocols were tested and compared to classically driven transducers. In the first protocol, prestrain is permanently applied, in the second protocol prestrain is applied for 100 micros before the compressive impulse, and in the third protocol prestrain is applied for 100 micros and followed by a bipolar field that allows the material to be repoled between two successive pulses. With the two first protocols, rapid depoling and repoling in the opposite direction was noticed. Only with the last protocol was it possible to increase the maximum surface pressure. This increase was approximately the same whether the material was hard or soft. Using this protocol, aging tests were conducted on three samples of each kind of material, and a pressure of 4 MPa was obtained over 10(6) shocks. This value seems to be enough to develop a piezoelectric shock-wave generator with a diameter of approximately 20 cm instead of the 45-cm commercially available.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2004-08-11", "authors": ["AlainBirer", "MohammadGhohestani", "DominiqueCathignol"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Piezoelectric ceramic rectangular transducers in flexural vibration.", "abstract": "Based on the equivalent elastic method and coupled vibration theory, an analytic method is presented to study the flexural vibration of rectangular transducers consisting of piezoelectric ceramic thin plates. By introducing a mechanical coupling coefficient, the flexural vibration of the piezoelectric ceramic rectangular thin plate is reduced to two simple, one-dimensional flexural vibrations of narrow piezoelectric ceramic strips. The resonance frequency equations for the piezoelectric ceramic rectangular thin-plate transducers in flexural vibration are derived under the free and simply supported boundary conditions analytically. The relationship between the resonance frequency and the flexural vibrational order, the geometrical shape, and the dimensions of the piezoelectric ceramic rectangular thin-plate transducer is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the one-dimensional vibrational theory for the flexural vibration of a narrow piezoelectric ceramic strip and the stripe-mode flexural vibrational theory for the piezoelectric ceramic rectangular thin plate can be derived directly from the theory obtained in this paper.

Protein samples are first separated by electrophoresis and then electroblotted to membranes, stained and destained, in an analogous manner as typically performed with Amido Black or Ponceau S dye staining of total protein profiles. After staining, blots are imaged using any of a variety of laser-based gel scanners, xenon-arc lamp-based gel scanners or charge-coupled device (CCD) camera-based imaging devices equipped with UV trans- or epi-illumination. The uncomplicated and reliable staining protocol delivers results in as little as 1 h and the limit of detection for the stain is typically 2-4 ng of phosphoprotein with a linear dynamic range of approximately 15-fold. Compared with traditional radiolabeling and antibody-based approaches, the new method offers significant advantages, including avoidance of radioactivity, no need for expensive antibodies, no requirement for blocking unoccupied sites on the membrane with protein or detergent solutions, no sequence context-specific binding to phosphorylated amino acid residues and the ability to analyze the native, steady-state phosphorylation of proteins obtained directly from tissue specimens or body fluids. Pro-Q Diamond dye binds directly and exclusively to the phosphate moiety, allowing it to detect the broadest spectrum of phosphorylated proteins possible.

The resulting chip effectively captured Ni2+ ions onto its NTA surface, as disclosed by the resonant frequency shift of the crystal and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The real-time frequency analysis revealed that the bare NTA chip was nonfouling, regenerable, and highly reusable during continuous repetitive injections of ion solutions and binding proteins. In addition, the chip displayed good long-term reusability and storage stability. The individual binding studies of a polyHis-tagged glutathione-S-transferase and its native untagged form on various metal-charged chips revealed that Co2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ ions each had different immobilization ability on the NTA surface, as well as their binding ability and selectivity with the tagged protein. As a result, the tagged protein immobilized on the Ni2+-charged chip can actively be bound with its antibody and substrate. Further, the quantitative analyses of the tagged protein in crude cell lysate with a single Ni2+-charged chip and of its substrate with a protein-coated chip were also successfully demonstrated.

Previously, the coliphage PR772 (Tectiviridae family) has been used in some filtration studies as a surrogate for mammalian viruses of around 50 to 60 nm. In this report, we describe specific properties of PR772 critical to the support of its use for the standardization of virus filters. The complete genomic sequence of virulent phage PR772 was determined. Its genome contains 14,946 bp with an overall G+C content of 48.3 mol%, and 32 open reading frames of at least 40 codons. Comparison of the PR772 nucleotide sequence with the genome of Tectiviridae family prototype phage PRD1 revealed 97.2% identity at the DNA level. By dynamic light-scattering analysis, its hydrodynamic diameter was measured as 82 +/- 6 nm, consistent with use in testing large-virus-retentive filters. Finally, dynamic light-scattering analysis of PR772 preparations purified on CsCl gradients showed that the phage preparations are largely monodispersed.

{"title": "Differential modulation of beta2 and beta4 subunits of human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by acidification.", "abstract": "We have shown previously that acidification increases the affinity of agonists to rat alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and accelerates both the activation and decay kinetics of agonist-induced currents recorded from human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the receptor (Abdrakhmanova et al., 2002b). Here, we report on experiments examining the effect of rapid acidification on four different subtypes (alpha3beta4alpha5, alpha4beta2, alpha3beta2, and alpha3beta2alpha5) of human neuronal nAChRs stably expressed in tsA201 cells using a piezoelectric device for rapid (<5 ms) solution application. Application of ACh, at its EC(50) concentration for each nAChR subtype, at pH values 7.4 and 6.0, showed that acidification, similarly to that reported for rat alpha3beta4 acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), increased the amplitude and accelerated the activation and decay kinetics of the currents in human alpha3beta4alpha5 AChRs by increasing their affinity to the agonist. In sharp contrast, acidification reduced the amplitude but accelerated the decay kinetics of the current in all human beta2-containing nAChR subtypes (alpha3beta2, alpha3alpha5beta2, alpha4beta2) examined in this study. Brief application of ACh at saturating concentration (1 mM) on alpha3beta4alpha5 AChRs induced a \"rebound current\" upon rapid washout of the agonist at pH 7.4, but no \"rebound current\" was observed in alpha3beta2 AChRs. Surprisingly, acidification, pH 6.0, applied only during the agonist pulse also accelerated the decay kinetics of the \"rebound current\". Our data provide evidence for the specificity of proton-induced modulation of neuronal nAChRs based on their beta subunit composition. Furthermore, in alpha3beta4alpha5 AChR, we find that protonation effects may persist, after washout of acidic solutions, consistent with proton-induced conformational changes of the receptor.", "journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "date": "2004-07-22", "authors": ["GalyaAbdrakhmanova", "LarsCleemann", "JonLindstrom", "MartinMorad"], "doi": "10.1124/mol.66.2.347"}
{"title": "Technological characteristics and clinical indications of piezoelectric bone surgery.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric bone surgery, also simply known as piezosurgery, is a new technique for osteotomy and osteoplasty utilizing an innovative ultrasonic surgical apparatus. This technique was created and developed in response to the need to reach major levels of precision and safety in bone surgery, as compared to that available by the usual manual and motorized instruments. The instrument which offers these results, known as the Mectron Piezosurgery Device, is characterized by piezoelectric ultrasonic vibrations of a frequency of 29 kHz and a range between 60/200 Hz. Due to their characteristics, the microvibrations allow a selective cut of only mineralized structures without damaging soft tissues, which remain undamaged even in case of accidental contact. The micrometric vibration ensures precise cutting action and at the same time maintains a blood-free site because of the physical phenomenon of cavitation. The micrometric vibration makes the instrument manageable and permits major interoperative control with a consequent increase in safety especially in anatomically difficult areas. The absence of macrovibrations makes the instrument more manageable and allows greater interoperative control with a significant increase in the cutting safety in the more difficult anatomical cutting zones. Given its innovative nature, piezosurgery distinguishes itself as being different from the conventional techniques utilised in bone surgery. Consequently, it requires different surgical skill. To master the right surgical skill it is essential to demonstrate an adequate learning curve.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2004-07-21", "authors": ["TVercellotti"], "doi": null}

Chemical-solution depositions such as sol-gel are more cost-effective, but many metal oxides cannot be deposited and the control of stoichiometry is not always possible owing to differences in chemical reactivity among the metals. Here we report a novel process to grow metal-oxide films in large areas at low cost using polymer-assisted deposition (PAD), where the polymer controls the viscosity and binds metal ions, resulting in a homogeneous distribution of metal precursors in the solution and the formation of uniform metal-organic films.

{"title": "Loss of atrial contractility is primary cause of atrial dilatation during first days of atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) induces a progressive dilatation of the atria which in turn might promote the arrhythmia. The mechanism of atrial dilatation during AF is not known. To test the hypothesis that loss of atrial contractile function is a primary cause of atrial dilatation during the first days of AF, eight goats were chronically instrumented with epicardial electrodes, a pressure transducer in the right atrium, and piezoelectric crystals to measure right atrial diameter. AF was induced with the use of repetitive burst pacing. Atrial contractility was assessed during sinus rhythm, atrial pacing (160-, 300-, and 400-ms cycle length), and electrically induced AF. The compliance of the fibrillating right atrium was measured during unloading the atria with diuretics and loading with 1 liter of saline. All measurements were repeated after 6, 12, and 24 h of AF and then once a day during the first 5 days of AF. Recovery of the observed changes after spontaneous cardioversion was also studied. After 5 days of AF, atrial contractility during sinus rhythm or slow atrial pacing was greatly reduced. During rapid pacing (160 ms) or AF, the amplitude of the atrial pressure waves had declined to 20% of control. The compliance of the fibrillating atria increased twofold, whereas the right atrial pressure was unchanged. As a result, the mean right atrial diameter increased by approximately 12%. All changes were reversible within 3 days of sinus rhythm. We conclude that atrial dilatation during the first days of AF is due to an increase in atrial compliance caused by loss of atrial contractility during AF. Atrial compliance and size are restored when atrial contractility recovers after cardioversion of AF.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The underlying principles of piercing are not clear for both cases, with and without the mercury. Presently, the pressure burst, which is caused by the abrupt axial motion of the mercury column, is attributed to this effect.

Losses in piezoceramics are phenomenologically considered to have three coupled mechanisms: dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric.

The extended definition of the PT electromechanical quality factor (EMQ) with permanent energy exchange between electrical source of excitation and PT was proposed. The EMQ analysis has been conducted on the basis of complex material constants for both stiffened and unstiffened canonical vibrational modes. The efficiency of mechanically free and electrically excited piezoceramic transducers in a wide frequency range of PT harmonics, especially between the fundamental resonance and antiresonance frequencies, was investigated, and the effect of piezoelectric loss anomaly with extremely low total losses was predicted. Particularly, optimization of PT excitation with connected reactive (capacitive) element was conducted to provide higher PT mechanical vibrational characteristics with less total losses.

In contrast to the plate-like thickness extensional resonance in traditional FBAR and SMR devices, the rod-like structures can be excited in their length extensional resonance, yielding a higher electromechanical coupling factor and effectively eliminating the spurious resonances from lateral modes of vibration. The designs have been investigated by two and three-dimensional finite element analyses and one-dimensional transmissionline modelling. The results show that significant increases in the electromechanical coupling factor of ca. 40% can be achieved by using the rod-like length extensional resonances as compared with the plate-like thickness extensional resonances in traditional devices.

However, calibrations below 2 MHz largely have been neglected because of insufficient transmitting transducer bandwidth, even though important medical applications operate in this range. To address this deficiency, several transmitting transducer designs were developed and tested, and two 1-3 piezoelectric composite designs were found to have the requisite bandwidth and uniformity of response. In one the element has a plane front face and spherically concave back face (plano-concave), and in the second both faces are concave, but with different radii of curvature (biconcave). The nonuniform thickness disperses the thickness resonance, and the composite structure suppresses radial-mode resonances. Also, the composite's lower acoustic impedance provides a more efficient match to water. The piezoelectric composite transducers were found to have transmitting pressure sensitivities superior to ceramic single-element and segmented designs having similar dimensions, and their responses were significantly more uniform (< 25 dB variation from 0.1-2 MHz, with < 1 dB fine structure variation), likely due to decreased contributions from radial modes.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2004-07-09", "authors": ["Gerald RHarris", "Paul MGammell"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1707090"}

The elevations of Ag, Ba and Sr were thought to originate from both natural geochemical and artificial pollutant sources--stemming from the common practise of aerial spraying with 'cloud seeding' Ag or Ba crystal nuclei for rain making in these drought prone areas of North America, the atmospheric spraying with Ba based aerosols for enhancing/refracting radar and radio signal communications as well as the spreading of waste Ba drilling mud from the local oil/gas well industry across pastureland. These metals have subsequently bioconcentrated up the foodchain and into the mammals who are dependent upon the local Cu deficient ecosystems. A dual eco-prerequisite theory is proposed on the aetiology of TSEs which is based upon an Ag, Ba, Sr or Mn replacement binding at the vacant Cu/Zn domains on the cellular prion protein (PrP)/sulphated proteoglycan molecules which impairs the capacities of the brain to protect itself against incoming shockbursts of sound and light energy. Ag/Ba/Sr chelation of free sulphur within the biosystem inhibits the viable synthesis of the sulphur dependent proteoglycans, which results in the overall collapse of the Cu mediated conduction of electric signals along the PrP-proteoglycan signalling pathways; ultimately disrupting GABA type inhibitory currents at the synapses/end plates of the auditory/circadian regulated circuitry, as well as disrupting proteoglycan co-regulation of the growth factor signalling systems which maintain the structural integrity of the nervous system. The resulting Ag, Ba, Sr or Mn based compounds seed piezoelectric crystals which incorporate PrP and ferritin into their structure. These ferrimagnetically ordered crystals multireplicate and choke up the PrP-proteoglycan conduits of electrical conduction throughout the CNS. The second stage of pathogenesis comes into play when the pressure energy from incoming shock bursts of low frequency acoustic waves from low fly jets, explosions, earthquakes, etc. (a key eco-characteristic of TSE cluster environments) are absorbed by the rogue 'piezoelectric' crystals, which duly convert the mechanical pressure energy into an electrical energy which accumulates in the crystal-PrP-ferritin aggregates (the fibrils) until a point of 'saturation polarization' is reached. Magnetic fields are generated on the crystal surface, which initiate chain reactions of deleterious free radical mediated spongiform neurodegeneration in surrounding tissues. Since Ag, Ba, Sr or Mn based piezoelectric crystals are heat resistant and carry a magnetic field inducing pathogenic capacity, it is proposed that these ferroelectric crystal pollutants represent the transmissible, pathogenic agents that initiate TSE.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2004-07-09", "authors": ["MarkPurdey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2004.02.041"}

{"title": "A method for measuring the size distribution of latex particles by scanning force microscopy.", "abstract": "A methodology has been developed to accurately determine the size distribution of latex particles using the scanning force microscope (SFM). Unlike other workers, who have generally measured the lateral dimensions of monolayers of latex particles using a global quantification method, we have measured the heights of individual latex particles located at the edges of latex monolayers that were immobilised onto mica substrates. In agreement with other work, we noted that the edges of monolayers of latex particles provided stable and reproducible scanning force imaging. Whilst SFM imaging noise, image processing artifacts, tip/sample forces and variations in the mica substrate are sources of measurement error that should not be overlooked, our experience has been that the variation over time of the sensitivity of the Z actuator is the greatest potential uncertainty in determining the heights of latex particles. The methodology that we used requires frequent calibration of the Z actuator of the SFM, typically before and after two or three images, in order to ensure that the uncertainties in the Z sensitivity are known and minimised. This methodology was developed for an SFM instrument that was equipped with open loop piezoelectric actuators following a careful study of the behaviour of those actuators. Using this methodology, we have measured the size distributions of populations of 300-400 latex particles from each of several different latex samples, with the maximum variation in the Z-actuator calibration experienced during the measurement of a sample being less than 2%, often about 1% and occasionally better still.

The combination of both controllers in lateral and vertical direction compensates the three-dimensional dynamics of the AFM system and reduces artifacts that are induced by the systems dynamic behavior at high scan rates. We demonstrate this improvement by comparing the performance of the model-based controlled AFM to the uncompensated and standard PI-controlled system when imaging pUC 18 plasmid DNA in air as well as in a liquid environment.", "journal": "Ultramicroscopy", "date": "2004-07-03", "authors": ["GSchitter", "R WStark", "AStemmer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultramic.2003.11.008"}

The main mechanism of the mixing is the acoustic stirring of the fluid perpendicular to the flow direction. The radiation pressure that is generated by the transducer causes the stirring inside the microfluidic channel.

Toward this end, design criteria for the matching layers and possible configurations are reviewed. Among the several factors that affect the efficiency of the matching layer, the importance of attenuation is pointed out. A standard characterization procedure is applied to a wide collection of candidate materials to produce matching layers. In particular, some types of filtration membranes are studied. From these results, the best materials are identified, and the better matching configuration is proposed. Four pairs of air-coupled piezoelectric transducers also are produced to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution. The lowest two-way insertion loss figure is -24 dB obtained at 0.45 MHz. This increases for higher frequency transducers up to -42 dB at 1.8 MHz and -50 at 2.25 MHz.

{"title": "Evaluation of a new modulus mapping technique to investigate microstructural features of human teeth.", "abstract": "Teeth contain several calcified tissues with junctions that provide interfaces between dissimilar tissues. These junctions have been difficult to characterize because of their small size. In this work a new technique using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and a force-displacement transducer was used to simultaneously study the surface topography and map mechanical properties of the junctions and adjacent hard tissues. Prepared specimens from human third molars were scanned by an AFM piezo-tube in contact mode. To measure the dynamic viscoelastic properties of the material a small sinusoidal force was superimposed on the contact force and the resulting displacement amplitude and the phase shift between the force and amplitude were measured. This force modulation technique was used to map the local variation of nanomechanical properties of intertubular dentin, peritubular dentin, enamel, dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) and peritubular-intertubular dentin junction (PIJ). This new technique allowed us to measure the widths of these junctions in addition to local variation in dentin and enamel without causing plastic deformation to the material and with 2 orders of magnitude increase in spatial resolution compared with previous studies that used discrete nanoindentation techniques. Due to the ability to analyze the sample line-by-line, the distribution functions associated with the width of the DEJ and PIJ were conveniently obtained for specific intratooth locations. The data suggested, for three third molar specimens, a DEJ width of 2-3 microm with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 microm and PIJ width of 0.5-1.0 microm with 0.3 microm FWHM. The intertubular dentin storage modulus variation was between 17 and 23 GPa with a mean value of 21 GPa. The range of storage modulus for enamel near the DEJ was between 51 and 74 GPa with a mean value of 63 GPa.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2004-06-24", "authors": ["GBalooch", "G WMarshall", "S JMarshall", "O LWarren", "S A SAsif", "MBalooch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2003.12.012"}
{"title": "Use of Mammalian eggs for assessment of human sperm function: molecular and cellular analyses of fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection.", "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI ) has been described as the 'cure' for male sterility because a single sperm can now be directly introduced into an egg with some chance of pregnancy. While ICSI has revolutionized the practice of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), there are few molecular and cellular studies about its safety and efficacy. Even by using ICSI, fertilization in humans succeeds only if the sperm effectively accomplishes a number of tasks including 'post-ICSI events' in fertilization. To assess the function of human sperm after ICSI, we used heterologous ICSI with human sperm into animal eggs. Egg activation, sperm decondensation and sperm centorosomal function were examined in sperm from fertile men and infertile patients.\nSperm from fertile men and infertile patients were injected into hamster, rabbit and bovine eggs by Piezo micromanipulator, and studied in decondensation of sperm nuclei, egg activation and microtubule organization.\nDecondensation human sperm head following ICSI into hamster eggs occurred initially form basal lesion, and apical portion of sperm nuclei which is surrounded by acrosome and perinuclear theca, still condensed in early pronuclear stage. Radial array of microtubules from sperm centrosome 'sperm aster' which is essential for pronuclear movement was observed in 30% rabbit eggs following ICSI with human sperm. By heterologous ICSI system with fertile human sperm and bovine eggs, 83.3% of eggs was activated and 60% eggs had sperm aster, indicating that bovine Piezo ICSI system is appropriate for assessing human sperm oocyte activation ability and human sperm centrosomal function. Oocyte activation and sperm centrosomal function were significantly low in sperm from men with globozoospermia and men with dysplasia of fibrous sheath.\nThese assays indicate differences of the process of fertilization between in vitro fertilization and ICSI, and reflect the human sperm function especially for the 'post-ICSI events' in fertilization.

The final result of these characteristics is a definite clinical advantage with regard to the cut precision, the sparing of vital nervous soft tissues, the better visualisation of the surgical area.

As a result of this, methods for postelectrophoretic protein characterization are of great interest as exemplified by in situ protease digestion combined with mass spectrometry (MS), which is the method of choice for identification of proteins. In this study we have developed and compared methods for recovering intact proteins from polyacrylamide gels and electroblotting membranes to define efficient methods compatible with MS. These methods complement in situ digestion protocols and allow determination of the molecular mass of whole proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Passive elution of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels was efficient only in the presence of SDS, whereas electroelution was achieved using buffers without SDS. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization MS (SELDI-MS) analysis of proteins eluted in the presence of SDS was possible using ion exchange ProteinChip arrays for concentration of sample and removal of SDS. Comparison of different electroblotting methods verified that the different membranes and buffers were equally efficient for transfer of proteins in the range 20-100 kDa. Elution from polyvinyldifluoride membranes was most efficient using either concentrated solutions of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or combinations of 8M urea and 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, or 40% isopropanol. The same result was obtained using nitrocellulose membranes, except that these were incompatible with organic solvent and TFA. Elution by TFA was compatible with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS (MALDI-MS) but was complicated by a high degree of trifluoroacetylation of the proteins. Alternatively, elution by 8M urea+1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, or 40% isopropanol was compatible with both SELDI-MS and MALDI-MS.

The MicroTime 200 time-resolved fluorescence microscope offers a multicolor excitation where different picosecond diode lasers are used. For imaging and positioning purposes we utilize a compact Piezo scanner which allows, due to a novel scanning algorithm and synchronisation technique, a superior movement and positioning accuracy. The data acquisition is completely based on time-correlated single photon counting, where every photon is detected and stored individually with its specific timing information (Time-Tagged Time-Resolved mode). This multiparameter data acquisition scheme offers the opportunity to analyse the parameter dependencies in a multitude of different ways. Standard intensity analysis can be used to reconstruct 2D-images or the temporal evolution (time trace) of the fluorescence of a single spot. The information from the two distinct detector channels additionally allows to investigate the polarisation of the emitted light or its spectral composition, for example for analysis of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The timing information down to a picosecond scale offers the possibility not only to reconstruct fluorescence decay constants of each pixel for the purpose of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) but also to analyze the fluorescence fluctuation correlation function of any single spot of interest. The flexible multichannel detector scheme enables in this case also a cross-correlation between spectrally separated parts of the emission light, or even identical parts of the fluorescence to eliminate detector artifacts. The photon arrival coincidence analysis can also be expanded in the sub-ns range to study fluorescence antibunching in the fluorescence emission of single molecules. The ability of combining these different pieces of temporal information allows the construction of extremely powerful analysis methods and assays.

{"title": "Response properties of whisker-related neurons in rat second somatosensory cortex.", "abstract": "In addition to a primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the cerebral cortex of all mammals contains a second somatosensory area (SII); however, the functions of SII are largely unknown. Our aim was to explore the functions of SII by comparing response properties of whisker-related neurons in this area with their counterparts in the SI. We obtained extracellular unit recordings from narcotized rats, in response to whisker deflections evoked by a piezoelectric device, and compared response properties of SI barrel (layer IV) neurons with those of SII (layers II to VI) neurons. Neurons in both cortical areas have similar response latencies and spontaneous activity levels. However, SI and SII neurons differ in several significant properties. The receptive fields of SII neurons are at least five times as large as those of barrel neurons, and they respond equally strongly to several principal whiskers. The response magnitude of SII neurons is significantly smaller than that of neurons in SI, and SII neurons are more selective for the angle of whisker deflection. Furthermore, whereas in SI fast-spiking (inhibitory) and regular-spiking (excitatory) units have different spontaneous and evoked activity levels and differ in their responses to stimulus onset and offset, SII neurons do not show significant differences in these properties. The response properties of SII neurons suggest that they are driven by thalamic inputs that are part of the paralemniscal system.

{"title": "A high-affinity reversible protein stain for Western blots.", "abstract": "We describe a reversible staining technique, using MemCode, a reversible protein stain by which proteins can be visualized on nitrocellulose and polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes without being permanently fixed to the membrane itself. This allows subsequent immunoblot analysis of the proteins to be performed. The procedure is applicable only to protein blots on nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes. MemCode is a reversible protein stain composed of copper as a part of an organic complex that interacts noncovalently with proteins. MemCode shows rapid protein staining, taking 30s to 1 min for completion. The method is simple and utilizes convenient application conditions that are compatible with the matrix materials and the protein. The stain is more sensitive than any previously described dye-based universal protein staining system. The turquoise-blue-stained protein bands do not fade with time and are easy to photograph compared to those stained with Ponceau S. Absorbance in the blue region of the spectrum offers good properties for photo documentation and avoids interference from common biological chromophores. The stain on the protein is easily reversible in 2 min for nitrocellulose membrane and in 10 min for PVDF membrane with MemCode stain eraser. The stain is compatible with general Western blot detection systems, and membrane treatment with MemCode stain does not interfere with conventional chemiluminescent or chromogenic detection using horseradish peroxide and alkaline phosphatase substrates. The stain is also compatible with N-terminal sequence analysis of proteins.", "journal": "Analytical biochemistry", "date": "2004-05-26", "authors": ["Babu SAntharavally", "BradCarter", "Peter ABell", "AKrishna Mallia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ab.2004.02.049"}

{"title": "Comparative analysis of parvalbumin and SERCA2a cardiac myocyte gene transfer in a large animal model of diastolic dysfunction.", "abstract": "Diastolic dysfunction results from impaired ventricular relaxation and is an important component of human heart failure. Genetic modification of intracellular calcium-handling proteins may hold promise to redress diastolic dysfunction; however, it is unclear whether other important aspects of myocyte function would be compromised by this approach. Accordingly, a large animal model of humanlike diastolic dysfunction was established through 1 yr of left ventricular (LV) pressure overload by descending thoracic aortic coarctation in canines. Serial echocardiography documented a progressive increase in LV mass. Diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function was evident at the whole organ and myocyte levels in this model, as determined by hemispheric sonomicrometric piezoelectric crystals, pressure transducer catheterization, and isolated myocyte studies. Gene transfer of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA2a) and parvalbumin (Parv), a fast-twitch skeletal muscle Ca(2+) buffer, restored cardiac myocyte relaxation in a dose-dependent manner under baseline conditions. At high Parv concentrations, sarcomere shortening was depressed. In contrast, during beta-adrenergic stimulation, the expected enhancement of myocyte contraction (inotropy) was abrogated by SERCA2a but not by Parv. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it could relate to the uncoupling of SERCA2a/phospholamban in SERCA2a myocytes. Considering that inotropy is vital to overall cardiac performance, the divergent effects of SERCA2a and Parv reported here could impact potential therapeutic strategies for human heart failure.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Cyclic voltammogram and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also use to investigate the formation of Au-colloid/CGC. The viscosity-average molecular weight of chitosan used was firstly estimated as 16.8 x 10(5) with piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) sensor. On the basis of the analysis of the multi-dimensional information provided by PQCI, two stages existed in chitosan drying course: the frequency shift of the first stage was controlled by viscoelastic of the liquid, while the total frequency shift was due to mass change. The cross-link ratio of glutaraldehyde with chitosan was about 0.13, while for glutaraldehyde with cysteamine was about 0.217. PQCI also showed that the Au-colloid immobilization is a first-order reaction, while the HSA immobilization is a sum of two exponential functions, e.g., adsorption and re-arrangement.

The PAAC-grafted porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with a wide range of grafting yields were prepared using a plasma-graft pore-filling polymerization method, and the immobilization of GOD was carried out by a carbodiimide method. The linear grafted PAAC chains in the membrane pores acted as the pH-responsive gates or actuators. The immobilized GOD acted as the glucose sensor and catalyzer; it was sensitive to glucose and catalyzed the glucose conversion to gluconic acid. The experimental results showed that the glucose responsivity of the solute diffusional permeability through the proposed membranes was heavily dependent on the PAAC grafting yield, because the pH-responsive change of pore size governed the glucose-responsive diffusional permeability. It is very important to design a proper grafting yield for obtaining an ideal gating response. For the proposed gating membrane with a PAAC grafting yield of 1.55%, the insulin permeation coefficient after the glucose addition (0.2 mol/l) was about 9.37 times that in the absence of glucose, presenting an exciting result on glucose-sensitive self-regulated insulin permeation.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2004-05-19", "authors": ["Liang-YinChu", "YanLi", "Jia-HuaZhu", "Hai-DongWang", "Yi-JianLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.02.026"}

An infinite planar periodic system of groups of strips with adequate period, sufficiently large if necessary, is considered to model an electric field in the plane of strips. There are electric charge distributions on strips either resulting from an external voltage source applied to the strips or induced by a propagating surface acoustic wave in the piezoelectric substrate. The latter case is equivalent, in the electrostatic approximation applied in this paper, to strips embedded in an already existing, spatially variable electric field. A method is presented for evaluation of the spatial spectrum of charge distribution that is responsible for either the surface wave generation or the scattering by strips in weak piezoelectrics.

Both impedance analysis and measurement of longitudinal vibration confirmed the simulation results with one pure longitudinal vibration mode at the resonant frequency in excellent agreement with the design value. Furthermore, at the resonant frequency, the measured longitudinal vibration amplitude at the nozzle tip increases as the number of Fourier horns (n) increases in good agreement with the theoretical values of 2(n). Using this design, very high vibration amplitude gain at the nozzle tip can be achieved with no reduction in the tip cross-sectional area for contact of liquid to be atomized.

We show that at small aspect ratio (thickness/lateral dimension <0.1) the measured d33meas is as much as 30% lower than the true value, d33true. Measured d33 increases with increasing aspect ratio and reaches its true value at a threshold aspect ratio that is dependent on ceramic composition and is about approximately 0.5 in the case of soft and hard Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. Experimental results show that, when the force is applied over the whole electroded surface of the sample, the d33 depends only on the aspect ratio and not size of samples. The experimental results are compared with simulations using finite element modeling (FEM) and are interpreted in terms of distribution of strain/stress within the sample, which leads to functional dependence of the measured d33 on transverse d31 and shear d15 coefficients. It is shown experimentally and by FEM that the value of d33 at low aspect ratios depends on the type of metallic contacts used to collect the charge and apply the pressure on the sample.

The statistical correlation between pressure-time integral and middle cerebral artery pulsatility index ratio and umbilical artery pulsatility index ratio are analysed using Pearson's correlation test.\nChanges in pulsatility indices of fetal middle cerebral and umbilical arteries and fetal heart rate after external cephalic version.\nThe overall success rate of external cephalic version was 77%. There was a significant negative correlation between pressure-time integral and both middle cerebral artery pulsatility index ratio (P= 0.001) and umbilical artery pulsatility index ratio (P= 0.012). When women were categorised according to placental site, pressure-time integral was negatively correlated with middle cerebral artery pulsatility index ratio only when the placenta was posteriorly located (P= 0.003), and with umbilical artery pulsatility index ratio only when the placenta was laterally located (P= 0.03).\nThe greater the force applied during external cephalic version, the greater the reduction in pulsatility indices of middle cerebral artery and umbilical artery, indicating an increase in blood flow through these arteries. The increase in cerebral blood flow after external cephalic version is more prominent when the placenta is lying posteriorly, while the increase in umbilical flow is more prominent when the placenta is lying laterally. These findings suggest that the vascular changes probably represent a direct effect of force exerted on the fetal head and the placenta.", "journal": "BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology", "date": "2004-04-24", "authors": ["Tak YeungLeung", "Daljit SinghSahota", "Wing YeeFok", "Lin WaiChan", "Tze KinLau"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00127.x"}

{"title": "Development of a compact self-focusing piezoelectric generator using electrical pre-strain piezocomposite material.", "abstract": "New clinical concepts in lithotripsy demand small shock heads. Reducing the size of piezoelectric shock heads will only be possible if the pressure generated at the surface of each transducer can be increased so that, the total pressure at the focus remains very high. So, we propose a new method allowing the generation of large surface pressures. It is well known that the piezoelectric rods in piezocomposite material are more fragile in the extension mode than in the compression mode. For this reason, actuators are mechanically pre-stressed between two flasks. This method cannot be used for transducers working at high frequencies, about 0.5 MHz. For this reason, we proposed to electrically pre-strain the piezoelectric material by applying high electric field in the opposite direction of the polarisation. In a first mode we proposed to pre-strain in continuous mode the transducer. Unfortunately we noticed a rapid de-poling and re-poling in the inverse direction. In a second mode to reduce depolarisation, this field was applied only during a short time just before the generation of the pulse which generate the compressive wave and in a third mode, the transducer was re-poled between two successive electrical pulses. Using this last method, it was possible to increase the maximum pressure at the surface of a 20 mm diameter plane piston to 20% and reach 4 MPa. According to this idea a very compact shock wave generator was designed. The generator made of a 1-3 piezocomposite material has a diameter of 120 mm and focused at 120 mm. The maximum pressure and the width of the compressive wave at the focus were, respectively, 60 MPa and 1.5 micros. The focal zone measured at -3 dB is an ellipsoid 6 mm high in the propagating axis and 3 mm width in the perpendicular direction. The efficacy of this generator was measured as the number of shocks necessary to totally disintegrate plaster balls 15 mm in diameter mimicking the kidney stones. At full power the number of shocks was only 150 which is rather the same number as the one obtained using electrohydraulic machine generally considered as the gold standard. This results show that piezoelectric material may be advantageously used for the manufacturing of shock wave generators.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2004-04-15", "authors": ["ABirer", "MGhohestani", "DCathignol"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2004.01.012"}
{"title": "Utilization of ultrasound to enhance high-speed water jet effects.", "abstract": "Continuous high-speed water jets are presently used in many industrial applications such as cutting of various materials, cleaning and removal of surface layers. However, there is still a need for further research to enhance the performance of pure water jets. An obvious method is to generate water jets at ultra-high pressures (currently up to 700 MPa). An alternate approach is to eliminate the need for such high pressures by pulsing of the jet. This follows from the fact that the impact pressure on a target generated by a slug of water is considerably higher than the stagnation pressure of a corresponding continuous jet. Ultrasonically forced modulation of a continuous stream of water represents the most promising method of pulsed jet generation because of its simplicity and practicality. A pulsed jet is generated by modulating a continuous stream of water by ultrasonic waves. A velocity transformer connected to a piezoelectric transducer is located axially inside a nozzle to induce longitudinal pulsations in the water. An extensive laboratory research program is in progress to understand the basic principles of the process and to optimize the nozzle design for several applications. The results reported in this paper show that the performance of such a pulsed jet is far superior to that of a continuous jet operating at the same parameters. Experimental results obtained with the ultrasonic vibration of a tip situated inside the nozzle indicate that using this technique one can achieve performance of the jet even order of magnitude higher in comparison to continuous jet at the same hydraulic parameters. Performance of ultrasonically modulated jets in cutting of various materials was tested in laboratory conditions. In this paper, results of measurement of dynamic pressure in the nozzle and force effects of modulated jets are presented together with results obtained in cutting of various materials using ultrasonically modulated water jets. The results are compared with those obtained with continuous jets at the same operating parameters. Potential of forced modulation of the jet in applications of cleaning, paint and coating removal from surfaces and concrete cutting in the process of repair of concrete structures is mentioned.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2004-04-15", "authors": ["JosefFoldyna", "LiborSitek", "BranislavSvehla", "StefanSvehla"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2004.01.008"}

To effectively monitor these responses, we built a filtration apparatus that allows for the rapid harvesting and processing of moderate volumes of yeast cells under controlled atmospheric conditions (e.g., anaerobic conditions). Harvesting by filtration offers several advantages over that by centrifugation, especially when rapid, repeated sampling of dilute cultures is required. A number of different filter membranes, including cellulose acetate, mixed esters of cellulose, regenerated cellulose, polycarbonate, and polyvinylidene fluoride, were assayed for harvest efficiency and the quality of RNA obtained by hot-phenol extraction from cells directly adhering to the membranes. To determine the suitability of the RNA for microarray analyses, we quantified both cDNA yield from reverse transcription and the indirect coupling of Cyan dyes. In general, filtration times, cell yields, and RNA quality were similar among the filters examined, although some media components (e.g., antifoam) can cause fouling of smaller-pore-sized filters. Thus, choice of a membrane will depend on the particular medium, ease of filter handling, or on other experimental considerations.

However the characteristic layered cellular anatomy of the retina makes it amenable to planar sectioning, enabling the generation of enriched retinal cell populations. The aim of this study was to validate a reproducible method for preparing enriched retinal layers from porcine retina.\nThe thicknesses of the retinal photoreceptor, inner nuclear and ganglion cell, and fiber layers were determined by routine histology of cross sections of fresh whole retina mounted on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Dissected retina (5 mm2) was placed on PVDF membrane and a series of planar cryosections corresponding to the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layer were removed leaving the ganglion cell and fiber layer which was subsequently detached from the membrane. The retinal specimens were stored at -80 degrees C. Representative planar tissue sections were sonicated in ice-chilled 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 7.9 and aliquots removed for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of genes indicative of specific retinal layers. Ammonium bicarbonate protein extracts were centrifuged, lyophilized and prepared for direct liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using a Waters Q-Tof Ultima.\nHistological analysis established the parameters for planar cryosectioning: photoreceptor layer (69+/-1.8 microm), outer plexiform (11+/-0.6 microm), inner nuclear layer (28+/-0.5 microm), inner plexiform, ganglion cell and fiber layer (100+/-5.3 microm). Gene expression profiling provided an independent method for validating the respective retinal preparations. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was expressed up to 21 fold higher in the inner retinal \"ganglion cell enriched\" fraction than in the outer retinal \"photoreceptor enriched\" fraction. The pattern was reversed for blue cone opsin, which was expressed up to 24 fold higher in the \"photoreceptor enriched\" fraction. Endogenous protein fragments indicative of each layer were identified by mass spectrometry and de novo sequence data obtained.\nCombined histological and mRNA expression profiling has confirmed the development of a reproducible method for generating validated porcine retinal layers enriched for specific cell types. Direct proteome analysis detected endogenous peptide fragments of characteristic retinal proteins.

That is, the material surface and the sensor must always be held by constant pressure in the vertical direction on the material side. Actually, it is difficult to overcome these problems; thus an ultrasonic inspection robot could not be widely applied. We then tried to develop an ultrasonic inspection robot with an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) which did not require a coupling medium to inspect the circumferential pipe parts. We developed a special EMAT that could transmit and receive alternately a Lamb wave with high sensitivity and a SH-plate wave without influence by the welded part.

Furthermore, we achieve mode identification by measuring deformation distributions on the vibrating specimen surface using laser-Doppler interferometry. Accurate measurements of frequencies and correct mode identification are the keys for deducing reliable Cij of the film. We applied this technique to copper thin films deposited of Si substrates. The resulting film's Cij are considerably smaller than the bulk's Cij and show anisotropy between the out-of-plane direction and in-plane direction.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2004-03-30", "authors": ["NobutomoNakamura", "HirotsuguOgi", "MasahikoHirao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2004.01.048"}
{"title": "1-3 connectivity piezoelectric ceramic-polymer composite transducers made with viscous polymer processing for high frequency ultrasound.", "abstract": "Potential applications of high frequency ultrasound exist because of the high spatial resolution consequent upon short wavelength. The frequencies of interest, typically from 25 MHz upwards, are easily supported by modern instrumentation but the capabilities of ultrasonic transducers have not kept pace and the transducers in high frequency commercial ultrasonic systems are still made with single-phase crystal, ceramic or piezopolymer materials. Despite potential performance advantages, the 1-3 connectivity piezoelectric ceramic-polymer composite materials now widely used at lower ultrasonic frequencies have not been adopted because of manufacturing difficulties. These difficulties are centred on fabrication of the 1-3 piezoceramic bristle-block comprising tall, thin pillars upstanding from a supporting stock. Fabrication techniques which have been explored already include injection moulding, mechanical dicing, and laser machining. Here, we describe an alternative technique based on viscous polymer processing (VPP) to produce net shape ceramic bristle-blocks. VPP produces green-state ceramic with rheological properties suitable for embossing. We outline how this can be created then report on our work to fabricate PZT bristle-blocks with lateral pillar dimensions of the order of 50 microm and height-to-width ratios of the order of 10. These have been backfilled with low pre-cure viscosity polymer and made into complete 1-3 piezocomposite transducer elements. We outline the performance of the transducers in terms of electrical impedance and pulse-echo behaviour and show that it corresponds well with computer modelling. We conclude that VPP is a promising technique to allow the established advantages of piezocomposite material to be exploited at higher frequencies than have been possible so far.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2004-03-30", "authors": ["AAbrar", "DZhang", "BSu", "T WButton", "K JKirk", "SCochran"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2004.02.008"}

Following the \"dice and fill\" technique, various composite transducers with 30 and 50% PZT volume fractions were fabricated with an air backing and no front matching layer with resonance operating frequencies around 500 kHz. The transducers were first evaluated under isothermal conditions, with a low emission duty cycle. Efficiencies as high as 95% were monitored as a function of the instantaneous input power up to a 60 W/cm(2) density. The effect of the polymer matrix mechanical losses and the fabrication conditions is then discussed. For the transducer thermal stability, the case of long duty cycle or continuous emission was considered in a second evaluation. In this case the transducer working temperature and axial radiated pressure were monitored as functions of the input power density up to 40 W/cm(2). It is shown that the transducer efficiency and working temperature were strongly dependent on the type of resin used but also on the PZT material, even for hard PZT compositions. A composite transducer configuration with strongly improved thermal stability was investigated demonstrating a working temperature higher than 90 degrees C and an extended power range (30-40 W/cm(2)). The composite thermal breakdown mechanism was analyzed and the effect of the curing-induced thermo-mechanical stresses on the PZT mechanical losses was considered in relation to the composite working temperature. Measurements of the composite mechanical losses versus the temperature were obtained and related to the variation of the PZT mechanical losses with the stresses due to the composite transducer temperature change. It is found that the thermally induced stress can strongly influence the PZT ceramic mechanical losses and that it can be the reason for a thermal breakdown taking place at a temperature much lower than the epoxy resin transition.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2004-03-30", "authors": ["CRichard", "H SLee", "DGuyomar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2003.12.037"}

{"title": "The influence of finite aperture and frequency response of ultrasonic hydrophone probes on the determination of acoustic output.", "abstract": "The influence of finite aperture and frequency response of piezoelectric ultrasonic hydrophone probes on the Thermal and Mechanical Indices was investigated using a comprehensive acoustic wave propagation model. The experimental verification of the model was obtained using a commercially available, 8 MHz, dynamically focused linear array and a single element, 5 MHz, focused rectangular source. The pressure-time waveforms were recorded using piezoelectric polymer hydrophone probes of different active element diameters and bandwidths. The nominal diameters of the probes ranged from 50 to 500 microm and their usable bandwidths varied between 55 and 100 MHz. The Pulse Intensity Integral (PII), used to calculate the Thermal Index (TI), was found to increase with increasing bandwidth and decreasing effective aperture of the probes. The Mechanical Index (MI), another safety indicator, was also affected, but to a lesser extent. The corrections needed were predicted using the model and successfully reduced the discrepancy as large as 30% in the determination of PII. The results of this work indicate that by accounting for hydrophones' finite aperture and correcting the value of PII, all intensities derived from the PII can be corrected for spatial averaging error. The results also point out that a caution should be exercised when comparing acoustic output data. In particular, hydrophone's frequency characteristics of the effective diameter and sensitivity are needed to correctly determine the MI, TI, and the total acoustic output power produced by an imaging transducer.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2004-03-30", "authors": ["E GRadulescu", "P ALewin", "JW\u00f3jcik", "ANowicki", "W ABerger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2003.11.019"}

Therefore, to help identify and validate practical calibration methods below 2 MHz, the authors have extended their previous individual efforts in an interlaboratory evaluation of sensitivity calibration using the swept-frequency technique, time delay spectrometry (TDS).

{"title": "A general model of the axle vibration in piezoelectric motors.", "abstract": "In the present work a general model of the vibrational behavior of the axle of a piezoelectric motor is proposed. In this motor, a cylinder-shaped permanent magnet, which act as a rotor, is pressed in contact with an end of a steel axle by means of the magnetic forces. The other end of the axle is fitted at the center of a rotating traveling wave generator. A piezoelectric membrane, vibrating in a flexural anti-symmetrical mode, or a thick disk, vibrating in a radial anti-symmetrical mode, can be exploited as traveling wave generators. In the first case a bending moment, in the second case a transverse force is applied to the axle. In both cases, if the driving frequency coincides with a resonance frequency of the axle, the axle acts as a resonant displacement amplifier; a continuous slipping takes place between the axle and the rotor, and a torque is transmitted to the rotor. The proposed model is able to describe the axle vibrational behavior when it is excited by a bending moment, by a transverse force, and also when these two excitations are simultaneously applied. The axle is modeled as a four-port system and all its transfer functions, as well as the transversal displacement along the axle at each frequency can be easily computed. Computed results have been compared with experimental measurements carried out on two motor prototypes that exploit as traveling wave generators a membrane and a disk, respectively.

With the advent of increased computer power and greater availability of software these simulations have become more readily available and will provide improved insight into wave propagation problems. Simulations have been undertaken of transient wave propagation in steel plates with an attached simple resonant transducer. This simulates acoustic emission (AE) propagation in plate like structures relevant to many industrial applications. Simulations for short propagation distances suggest the resonant transducer voltage signal carries information on the plate-waves propagating in the structure, overlaid with the piezoelectric resonance and some information might be extracted from the transducer signal. Looking at the wave propagation information alone, a great deal of variability is seen in the displacement profile for different source types, orientations and locations. Although users have expressed a need for calibration of the AE detection process, this idea remains problematic since the complete generation and detection system has the features of a chaotic system.

Air or gas incorporation is done during the beating process which produces bubbles in the mixture. The density and the compressibility of the batter vary as a function of mixing time and are quality index of batter. Traditionally, a batter sample of a fixed volume is removed and weighted in order to determine its density. This is a time consuming process. Batters are air filled mixtures of high viscosity which do not support significant transmission of ultrasound. For this reason conventional ultrasonic density sensors for liquids are not suitable for this application. Therefore, a special transducer has been developed. The sensor was constructed using a piezoelectric ceramic at the fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. Instead of measuring density, in this work, changes in compressibility in batters are monitored by measuring the acoustic impedance of the batter. Main advantage of this novel approach is that changes in acoustic impedance are easier to detect than changes in density especially when air incorporation is in small quantities.

{"title": "Autoresonant control of nonlinear mode in ultrasonic transducer for machining applications.", "abstract": "Experiments conducted in several countries have shown that the improvement of machining quality can be promoted through conversion of the cutting process into one involving controllable high-frequency vibration at the cutting zone. This is achieved through the generation and maintenance of ultrasonic vibration of the cutting tool to alter the fracture process of work-piece material cutting to one in which loading of the materials at the tool tip is incremental, repetitive and controlled. It was shown that excitation of the high-frequency vibro-impact mode of the tool-workpiece interaction is the most effective way of ultrasonic influence on the dynamic characteristics of machining. The exploitation of this nonlinear mode needs a new method of adaptive control for excitation and stabilisation of ultrasonic vibration known as autoresonance. An approach has been developed to design an autoresonant ultrasonic cutting unit as an oscillating system with an intelligent electronic feedback controlling self-excitation in the entire mechatronic system. The feedback produces the exciting force by means of transformation and amplification of the motion signal. This allows realisation for robust control of fine resonant tuning to bring the nonlinear high Q-factor systems into technological application. The autoresonant control provides the possibility of self-tuning and self-adaptation mechanisms for the system to keep the nonlinear resonant mode of oscillation under unpredictable variation of load, structure and parameters. This allows simple regulation of intensity of the process whilst keeping maximum efficiency at all times. An autoresonant system with supervisory computer control was developed, tested and used for the control of the piezoelectric transducer during ultrasonically assisted cutting. The system has been developed as combined analog-digital, where analog devices process the control signal, and parameters of the devices are controlled digitally by computer.

We hypothesized that overexpression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase pump (SERCA2a) may improve both contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias. Continuous ECG recordings were obtained in 46 conscious rats after adenoviral gene transfer of either SERCA2a or the reporter gene beta-galactosidase (beta gal) or parvalbumin (PV), as early as 48 h before and 48 h after 30 min ligation of the left anterior descending artery by using an implantable telemetry system. Sham-operated animals were used for comparison for hemodynamic measurements, whereas within-animal baseline was used for electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. All episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were counted, and their durations were summed by telemetry. I/R decreased regional cardiac wall thickening as well as the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+dP/dt) and ventricular pressure fall (-dP/dt). SERCA2a restored regional wall thickening and +dP/dt and -dP/dt to levels seen preoperatively. Regional-wall motion and anterior-wall thickening were improved in the SERCA2a animals, as assessed by echocardiography and piezoelectric crystals. To assess whether these effects are SERCA2a specific, we overexpressed a skeletal-muscle protein, PV, to examine whether Ca(2+) buffering alone can mitigate ventricular arrhythmias. During the first hour after I/R, the rate of nonsustained VT plus VF was 16 +/- 5 episodes per h (n = 6) in the Ad.beta gal group, 22 +/- 6 in the Ad.PV group, and 4 +/- 2(n = 6, P < 0.01) in the Ad.SERCA2a group.

The percentages of blastocyst formation (14%, 12%, and 11%) and the number of nuclei of blastocysts (54 +/- 13, 51 +/- 11, and 52 +/- 12) were similar among the piezo, laser, and conventional groups, but significantly lower than for the control group (83%, 105 +/- 14). The piezo technique is more efficient than the conventional method for nuclear transfer. The laser method is easy to operate, but the equipment is expensive. In addition, piezo induced fewer traumas while breaking the membrane than the aspiration techniques used in the laser and conventional methods.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

{"title": "Experimental application of pulsed Ho:YAG laser-induced liquid jet as a novel rigid neuroendoscopic dissection device.", "abstract": "Although water jet technology has been considered as a feasible neuroendoscopic dissection methodology because of its ability to perform selective tissue dissection without thermal damage, problems associated with continuous use of water and the ensuing fountain-effect-with catapulting of the tissue-could make water jets unsuitable for endoscopic use, in terms of safety and ease of handling. Therefore, the authors experimented with minimization of water usage during the application of a pulsed holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser-induced liquid jet (LILJ), while assuring the dissection quality and the controllability of a conventional water jet dissection device. We have developed the LILJ generator for use as a rigid neuroendoscope, discerned its mechanical behavior, and evaluated its dissection ability using the cadaveric rabbit ventricular wall.\nThe LILJ generator is incorporated into the tip of a stainless steel tube (length: 22 cm; internal diameter: 1.0 mm; external diameter: 1.4 mm), so that the device can be inserted into a commercial, rigid neuroendoscope. Briefly, the LILJ is generated by irradiating an internally supplied water column within the stainless steel tube using the pulsed Ho:YAG laser (wave length: 2.1 microm, pulse duration time: 350 microseconds) and is then ejected through the metal nozzle (internal diameter: 100 microm). The Ho:YAG laser pulse energy is conveyed through optical quartz fiber (core diameter: 400 microm), while cold water (5 degrees C) is internally supplied at a rate of 40 ml/hour. The relationship between laser energy (range: 40-433 mJ/pulse), standoff distance (defined as the distance between the tip of the optical fiber and the nozzle end; range: 10-30 mm), and the velocity, shape, pressure, and average volume of the ejected jet were analyzed by means of high-speed camera, PVDF needle hydrophone, and digital scale. The quality of the dissection plane, the preservation of blood vessels, and the penetration depth were evaluated using five fresh cadaveric rabbit ventricular walls, under neuroendoscopic vision.\nJet velocity (7.0-19.6 m/second) and pressure (0.07-0.28 MPa) could be controlled by varying the laser energy, which determined the penetration depth in the cadaveric rabbit ventricular wall (0.07-1.30 mm/shot). The latter could be cut into desirable shapes-without thermal effects-under clear neuroendoscopic vision. The average volume of a single ejected jet could be confined to 0.42-1.52 microl/shot, and there was no accompanying generation of shock waves. Histological specimens revealed a sharp dissection plane and demonstrated that blood vessels of diameter over 100 microm could be preserved, without thermal damage.\nThe present pulsed LILJ system holds promise as a safe and reliable dissection device for deployment in a rigid neuroendoscope.", "journal": "Lasers in surgery and medicine", "date": "2004-03-17", "authors": ["TomohiroOhki", "AtsuhiroNakagawa", "TakayukiHirano", "TokitadaHashimoto", "VirenMenezes", "HidefumiJokura", "HiroshiUenohara", "YasuhikoSato", "TsutomuSaito", "ReizoShirane", "TeijiTominaga", "KazuyoshiTakayama"], "doi": "10.1002/lsm.20021"}

Despite the inherent advantages of this printing method, little attention has been devoted to the quantitative aspects of dispensing small volumes of dilute protein solutions from the borosilicate glass capillaries employed by piezoelectric dispensers. Here, a method is detailed that demonstrates the benefits of using a low-ionic-strength phosphate printing buffer containing the carrier protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) to deposit capture antibody microspots. When this buffer is used to deposit biotinylated capture antibodies, 3.6- to 44-fold more protein is delivered to an avidin-coated surface compared to when the antibodies are deposited in standard phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the absence of BSA.

{"title": "A successful model to assess embryo development after transplantation of prophase nuclei.", "abstract": "Germinal vesicle transplantation (GVT) provides a means of investigating interactions between karyoplasts and cytoplasts isolated from different cells. Technically, GVT can be accomplished with a high degree of efficiency without compromising the maturation of either the human or mouse oocyte nucleus. Although maturation, fertilization and preimplantation development have been established using GVT, full-term development has been reported only after supplementation with fresh mature ooplasm. In this study, we assess the ability of immature oocytes collected from gonadotrophin-primed ovaries to mature in vitro after GVT and develop to full-term.\nGV oocytes were retrieved from either non-stimulated or pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin (PMSG)-primed female mice. Microsurgically isolated GV karyoplasts were transplanted into previously enucleated oocytes. Oocytes successfully reconstituted by electrofusion were cultured for 14 h to allow nuclear maturation. Metaphase II oocytes were subjected to Piezo-ICSI, and those fertilized normally were cultured to the blastocyst stage. Some such embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant female mice to examine their potential for normal development. Cumulus-denuded non-manipulated oocytes that were matured in vitro served as controls.\nThe reconstitution and maturation rates were comparable in oocytes isolated from PMSG-primed and from unstimulated ovaries. The rate of normal fertilization in oocytes from primed ovaries was significantly higher than that of their non-primed counterparts (63.5 versus 39.6%; P < 0.01). This difference was also confirmed in terms of blastocyst development (31.8 versus 7.9%; P < 0.01). Of a total of 70 embryos transferred to the oviduct of five recipient mice, 21.4% developed to normal live offspring. All developed as normal adults and proved to be fertile. The live birth rate was comparable to that obtained using non-manipulated control oocytes (22.3%).\nHigher rates of fertilization and blastocyst formation were obtained after GVT of mouse oocytes isolated from PMSG-primed ovaries compared with their non-primed counterparts. These represent the first mouse offspring derived from in vitro matured, cumulus-denuded oocytes treated by allo-GVT and fertilized by ICSI. Thus, GVT appears not to impair oocyte maturation, fertilization and pre- and post-implantation development and, after gonadotrophin priming, allows generation of healthy mouse offspring without mature ooplasm supplementation.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2004-03-16", "authors": ["TakumiTakeuchi", "ZevRosenwaks", "Gianpiero DPalermo"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/deh149"}

The clinical outcome was observed by clinical observation, regular esophagoscopies and X-ray contrast medium examinations. Local tissue regeneration was verified by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\nAfter an observation period of 3 months we found no anastomotic strictures, complete mucosal regeneration, minimal inflammation reaction and initial regeneration of the muscle layer for the PVDF group. Within the polyglactin 910 group, three patch failures with consecutive anastomotic leakage occurred.\nThe results indicate that PVDF mesh structure gives the opportunity of local tissue regeneration in the esophagus.

{"title": "Single cell mechanics of rat cardiomyocytes under isometric, unloaded, and physiologically loaded conditions.", "abstract": "One of the most salient characteristics of the heart is its ability to adjust work output to external load. To examine whether a single cardiomyocyte preparation retains this property, we measured the contractile function of a single rat cardiomyocyte under a wide range of loading conditions using a force-length measurement system implemented with adaptive control. A pair of carbon fibers was used to clamp the cardiomyocyte, attached to each end under a microscope. One fiber was stiff, serving as a mechanical anchor, while the bending motion of the compliant fiber was monitored for force-length measurement. Furthermore, by controlling the position of the compliant fiber using a piezoelectric translator based on adaptive control, we could change load dynamically during contractions. Under unloaded conditions, maximal shortening velocity was 106 +/- 8.9 microm/s (n = 13 cells), and, under isometric conditions, peak developed force reached 5,720 nN (41.6 +/- 5.6 mN/mm(2); n = 17 cells). When we simulated physiological working conditions consisting of an isometric contraction, followed by shortening and relaxation, the average work output was 828 +/- 123 J/m(3) (n = 20 cells). The top left corners of tension-length loops obtained under all of these conditions approximate a line, analogous to the end-systolic pressure-volume relation of the ventricle.

This paper describes a model for the combined acoustic response of the extensional modes of vibration of a piezoelectric ceramic cylinder, a method of synthesizing a desired radiation pattern, and an experimental implementation of a directional transducer that uses these techniques.

{"title": "Theoretical analysis and experimental measurement for resonant vibration of piezoceramic circular plates.", "abstract": "Based on the electroelastic theory for piezoelectric plates, the vibration characteristics of piezoceramic disks with free-boundary conditions are investigated in this work by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental measurement. The resonance of thin piezoceramic disks is classified into three types of vibration modes: transverse, tangential, and radial extensional modes. All of these modes are investigated in detail. Two optical techniques, amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry (AF-ESPI) and laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV), are used to validate the theoretical analysis. Because the clear fringe patterns are shown only at resonant frequencies, both the resonant frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes are obtained experimentally at the same time by the proposed AF-ESPI method. Good quality of the interferometric fringe patterns for both the transverse and extensional vibration mode shapes are demonstrated. The resonant frequencies of the piezoceramic disk also are measured by the conventional impedance analysis. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the transverse and tangential vibration modes cannot be measured by the impedance analysis, and only the resonant frequencies of extensional vibration modes can be obtained. Numerical calculations based on the finite element method also are performed, and the results are compared with the theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. It is shown that the finite element method (FEM) calculations and the experimental results agree fairly well for the resonant frequencies and mode shapes.

However, the fertility of cryopreserved spermatozoa from some inbred strains such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c is extremely poor. We have recently reported that a partial zona-pellucida incision by piezo-micromanipulator (ZIP) significantly improves the fertilization rate and subsequent embryonic development after in vitro fertilization (IVF) using cryopreserved C57BL/6 transgenic mouse spermatozoa and that inbred C57BL/6 mice could be produced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These findings prompted us to compare the efficiency of fertilization and subsequent embryonic development between ICSI and IVF with ZIP (ZIP/IVF) using cryopreserved spermatozoa. In conventional IVF, BALB/cA, C57BL/6J, and B6C3F1 cryopreserved spermatozoa fertilized 19%, 0%, and 51% of oocytes, respectively. The fertilization rates of manipulated oocytes by ICSI versus ZIP/IVF using cryopreserved BALB/cA spermatozoa were 52% versus 68%, cryopreserved C57BL/6J spermatozoa were 43% versus 63%, and cryopreserved B6C3F1 spermatozoa were 58% versus 82%, respectively. In these strains, fertilization rates for ZIP/IVF were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for other techniques. However, embryonic development to term for oocytes fertilized by cryopreserved spermatozoa was not significantly different between ZIP/IVF and ICSI in C57BL/6J and B6C3F1. The overall efficiency of mouse production in ZIP/IVF was higher than for ICSI and conventional IVF in C57BL/6J and B6C3F1. Furthermore, ZIP/IVF required approximately 3.3 times less manipulation time than did ICSI.

The transmit part, consisting of a lead zirconate-titanate (PZT) material, emits at a frequency of 500 kHz and could generate pressures up to 410 kPa. On the top of the transmit surface, a thin polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) layer is glued and used for receiving frequencies from 250 kHz (f0/2) up to 2.5 MHz (5 f0). To evaluate this new design, ultrasonic measurements were carried out with gas bubbles with diameters ranging from 10 microm up to 90 microm and solid particles between 350 microm and 550 microm. The experimental results confirmed our previous findings: gaseous emboli with a diameter close to the resonance size scatter significantly at higher harmonic components (from the second harmonic up to the fifth), and bubbles with a diameter around twice the resonance size produce a subharmonic and/or an ultraharmonic component. Meanwhile, solid particles and other bubble sizes behave only linearly and their scattered spectrum appeared without any harmonics.

{"title": "Structural characterization of proteins and peptides.", "abstract": "The primary structure of proteins is nowadays determined by DNA sequencing, and a variety of genomes are already known. Nevertheless, protein sequencing/identification is still indispensable to analyze the proteins expressed in a cell, to identify specific proteins, and to determine posttranslational modifications. Proteins of interest are typically available in low microgram amounts or even less. The separation method of choice is gel electrophoresis, followed by blotting to PVDF membrane for N-terminal sequencing or by in-gel digestion to generate peptides that can be separated by HPLC. Structural analysis can be done by Edman degradation or mass spectrometry (MS). Edman degradation is the older method based on successive removal of N-terminal amino acids by chemical methods. Sequencing of a peptide requires many hours, the sensitivity is in the range of 2-5 pmol of a purified peptide. Nevertheless, Edman degradation is still the workhorse in the lab for routine work such as identification of blotted proteins. It is also the method of choice for sequencing unknown proteins/ peptides and modified peptides. MS has routinely been used with peptides in the range of 100 fmol or even less. In contrast to Edman degradation, complex mixtures such as tryptic digests can be analyzed, making HPLC separation of peptides unnecessary. MS is a very fast method that can be automated. It is the method of choice for sensitive analysis and large-scale applications (proteomics). Two different ionization methods are commonly used to generate peptide/protein ions for MS analysis. These are MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization) and ESI (electrospray ionization). They can be combined with a variety of mass analyzers (TOF, quadrupole, ion trap). Proteins are either identified by searching databases with the masses of proteolytic peptides (peptide mass fingerprinting) or using fragmentation data (raw MS/MS spectra or sequence tags). This approach requires that the protein is known and listed in the database. De novo sequencing by MS of peptides is possible, but very time consuming and not a routine application, in contrast to Edman degradation.

{"title": "Mechanisms for the modulation of native glycine receptor channels by ethanol.", "abstract": "Previously, we showed that ethanol increases synaptic glycine currents, an effect that depends on ethanol concentration and developmental age of the preparation. Glycine receptor (GlyR) subunits undergo a shift from alpha2/beta to alpha1/beta from neonate to juvenile ages, with synaptic glycine currents from neonate hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) being less sensitive to ethanol than those from juvenile HMs. Here we investigate whether these dose and developmental effects are also present in excised membrane patches containing GlyRs and if ethanol changes response kinetics. We excised outside-out patches from rat HM somata and applied glycine using either a picospritzer or piezo stack translator. Ethanol (100 mM) increased the response to glycine (200 microM) of patches from neonate and juvenile HMs. However, 30 mM ethanol increased the response from only juvenile HM patches. Using a lower concentration of glycine (30 microM) to observe single channel openings, we found that 100 mM ethanol increased the number of GlyRs that open in response to glycine and decreased first latency to channel opening. To investigate GlyR kinetic properties, we rapidly applied 1 mM glycine for 1 ms and found that glycine currents were increased by ethanol (100 mM) at both ages. For patches from juvenile HMs, ethanol consistently decreased response rise-time and increased response decay time. Using kinetic modeling, we determined that ethanol's potentiation of the glycine response arises from an increase in the glycine association (k(on)) and a decrease in the dissociation (k(off)) rate constants, resulting in increased glycine affinity of the GlyR.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2004-02-06", "authors": ["Erika DEggers", "Albert JBerger"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.00907.2003"}

Data reported here describe the first characterization of CT coincident with intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the mouse system. Sibling oocytes were used to transfer 2, 4, or 6 pl of ooplasm to a recipient egg along with a sperm head using piezo-actuated injection. Survival and fertilization after CT were comparable to controls at 2 pl and 4 pl, but survival was significantly reduced with 6 pl volumes. Development to the blastocyst stage was also inversely related to CT volume, with some decline beginning with the 4 pl CT group. However, some blastocysts did develop in all of the groups. The results are in contrast with human eggs, which tolerate larger CT volumes. Results indicate that the mouse system can be used to characterize the transfer of exogenous materials concomitant with sperm injection, provided that the CT volume is not excessive.", "journal": "Reproductive biomedicine online", "date": "2004-02-05", "authors": ["SeiichiroNagai", "TsuyoshiKasai", "ShujiHirata", "KazuhikoHoshi", "RyuzoYanagimachi", "ThomasHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/s1472-6483(10)60500-7"}

The effect of the thickness of thick piezoelectric element electrodes on the transducer performance is analyzed. The effect of the length and position of the piezoelectric elements in the transducer is also studied. It is shown that, although using thick electrodes is beneficial for releasing heat produced by the piezoelectric elements, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient and the mechanical quality factor are reduced. The length and the position of the piezoelectric elements affect the performances of the transducer. Increasing the length of the piezoelectric elements decreases the mechanical quality factor, but the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient increases. When the length reaches a certain value, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient reaches a maximum value.

The viscoelastic material is cut into a cylindrical sample which is clamped between two rods. The transmission and reflection coefficient spectra of the fundamental torsional mode through the sample are measured by means of two pairs of piezoelectric transducers placed at the free ends of the rod-sample-rod system. Such spectra exhibit maxima and minima which occur approximately at the resonance frequencies of the free viscoelastic cylinder. Therefore, the shear velocity can be obtained by measuring the frequency interval between two consecutive maxima or minima. The shear attenuation is derived by best fitting the analytical expression of the reflection and transmission coefficients to the experimental spectra. The test is very quick to set up as the sample is simply clamped between the two rods.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2004-02-05", "authors": ["FSimonetti", "PCawley"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1631944"}

The MIP was prepared by co-polymerizing methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) in the presence of azobis(isobutyronitrile) as initiator, caffeine as template molecule, and chloroform as solvent. The MIP suspension in polyvinyl chloride/tetrahydrofuran (6:2:1 w/w/v) solution was spin coated onto the surface of the electrode of a 10 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal. The sensor exhibited a linear relationship between the frequency shift and caffeine concentration in the range of 1 x 10(-7) mg mL(-1 )up to 1 x 10(-3) mg mL(-1) [correlation coefficient ( r)=0.9935] in a stopped flow measurement mode. It has a sensitivity of about 24 Hz/ln(concentration, mg mL(-1)). A steady-state response was achieved in less than 10 min. The performance characteristic of the sensor shows a promising and inexpensive alternative method of detecting caffeine. Surface studies were carried out for the reagent phase of the sensor using SEM, AFM, and XPS analysis in order to elucidate the imprinting of the caffeine molecule.

{"title": "Large electric-field-induced strain in ferroelectric crystals by point-defect-mediated reversible domain switching.", "abstract": "Ferroelectric crystals are characterized by their asymmetric or polar structures. In an electric field, ions undergo asymmetric displacement and result in a small change in crystal dimension, which is proportional to the applied field. Such electric-field-induced strain (or piezoelectricity) has found extensive applications in actuators and sensors. However, the effect is generally very small and thus limits its usefulness. Here I show that with a different mechanism, an aged BaTiO(3) single crystal can generate a large recoverable nonlinear strain of 0.75% at a low field of 200 V mm(-1). At the same field this value is about 40 times higher than piezoelectric Pb(Zr, Ti)O(3) (PZT) ceramics and more than 10 times higher than the high-strain Pb(Zn(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-PbTiO(3) (PZN-PT) single crystals. This large electro-strain stems from an unusual reversible domain switching (most importantly the switching of non-180 degrees domains) in which the restoring force is provided by a general symmetry-conforming property of point defects. This mechanism provides a general method to achieve large electro-strain effect in a wide range of ferroelectric systems and the effect may lead to novel applications in ultra-large stroke and nonlinear actuators.", "journal": "Nature materials", "date": "2004-01-13", "authors": ["XiaobingRen"], "doi": "10.1038/nmat1051"}
{"title": "Coordinated gastric and sphincter motility evoked by intravenous CCK-8 as monitored by ultrasonomicrometry in rats.", "abstract": "Gastric and sphincter motility evoked by intravenous injection of CCK-8 were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Digital ultrasonomicrometry was used to monitor pyloric (PYL), antral (ANT), corpus (COR), and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) movements while simultaneously measuring intragastric pressure (IGP) and, in some experiments, subdiaphragmatic intraesophageal pressure (sIEP). Intracrystal distances (ICD) were measured continuously between pairs of piezoelectric crystals affixed to the serosa of PYL, ANT, COR (circular and longitudinal), and LES. Consecutive intravenous injections of CCK-8 (0.3, 1, and 3 microg/kg) at 30-min intervals caused dose-dependent simultaneous tonic contractions of PYL and ANT, LES opening, and drops in IGP with peak changes at 3 microg/kg of -17.9 +/- 2.1, -7.7 +/- 2.5, 6.5 +/- 1.4, and -29.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively, whereas intravenous saline had no effect. Rhythmic contractile activity was inhibited by CCK-8. COR responses were not significantly different from vehicle controls for most metrics, and the direction of response for circular COR varied between preparations, although not for repeated trials in a single preparation. During the LES response to CCK-8, sIEP rose in parallel with drops in IGP, indicating formation of a common cavity. Recovery of LES ICD after intravenous CCK occurred more rapidly than recovery of PYL ICD, suggesting the importance of preventing simultaneous patency of gastroesophageal and gastroduodenal passages.

By the use of the proposed illumination design a He-Ne laser as a point light source is transformed to an extended light source, which is beneficial to localize interference fringe pattern near the test surface. To obtain an optimal contrast of the interference fringe pattern, the flat mirror with an adjustable reflection ratio is used to suit different test surfaces. A piezoelectric transducer attached on the reference mirror can move precisely along the optical axis of the objective and permits implementation of four-step phase-shifting interferometry without changing the relative position between the CCD sensor and the test surface. Therefore, an absolutely constant optical magnification can be accurately kept to capture the interference fringe patterns resulting from a combination of light reflected from both the reference flat mirror and the test surface. The experimental result shows that surface profile on a fiber-end with surface features such as a small fiber diameter of 125 microm and a low reflection ratio of less than 4% are measurable.

Every crystal unit of the fabricated piezoelectric hCG micro-array immunosensor can oscillate independently without interfering each other. A 2 x 5 model of micro-array immunosensor as compared with a one-channel immunosensor can provide eight times higher detection speeds for hCG assay. The anti-hCG antibody is deposited on the gold electrode's surface of 10 MHz quartz AT-cut crystal by self-assembled technique using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3'-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido] hexanoate (Sulfo-LC-SPDP), and serves as an antibody recognizing layer. The highly ordered self-assembled monolayers (SAM) ensure well-controlled surface structure and offer many advantages to the performance of the sensor. Compared with conventional antibody immobilization methods, the amount and the reaction activity of antibody monolayer coated by the SAM binding are bigger than those by the SPA method, and less non-specific binding caused by other analytes in sample is found. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the results showed that micro-array immunosensor quantitatively detected serum or urine hCG in the range of 2.5-500 mIU/ml with high precision (CV<5%); other hormones in human serum and urine did not interfere with the determination markedly.

{"title": "A piezoelectric immunoagglutination assay for Toxoplasma gondii antibodies using gold nanoparticles.", "abstract": "The serologic detection of anti-Toxoplasma gondii immunoglobulins plays a key role in the clinical diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis. In this paper, a simple, rapid and highly sensitive agglutination-based piezoelectric immunoassay has been firstly developed for directly detecting anti-T. gondii immunoglobulins in infected rabbit serum (IRS) and infected rabbit blood (IRB). The proposed technique is based on that the specific agglutination of antigen-coated gold nanoparticles, averaging 10nm in diameter, in the presence of the corresponding antibody causes a frequency change that is monitored by a piezoelectric device. In contrast to the commonly used piezoelectric assays, it possesses an attractive advantage in that the immobilization of antibody or antigen on the crystal is unnecessary. Use of a newly prepared sensing probe which was modified by a plasma-polymerized film (PPF) of n-butyl amine and further by a heparin layer resulted in a response-enhanced immunoagglutination and a high compatibility of the probe with biological samples. An appropriate reagent consisting of 1% normal rabbit serum (NRS) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for diluting the analytes were verified in counteracting the background interference of assay. Moreover, an optimization of assay medium composition with the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) serving as immunoagglutination rate and sensitivity enhancer was investigated in detail. It is found that the developed immunoagglutination assay system is sensitive to dilution ratio of anti-T. gondii antibody as low as 1:5500.

In this case, CAP detection which was indicated by steady-state resonant frequency shift was accomplished within 10 min.

The sensor consists of a needle-shaped 20-microm transduction point made using a micro-electrode puller and mounted on a micro-manipulator platform. Measurements were made under microscopic control, using a suction pipette to support the ovum in the same horizontal axis as the MTS. Young's modulus of ovum was found to be 25.3+/-7.94 kPa (n=28).
