{"title": "The WOMED model of benign thyroid disease: Acquired magnesium deficiency due to physical and psychological stressors relates to dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to discern whether a relation between biochemical parameters, sonography and musculoskeletal data exists in cases of hyperthyroidism and whether they are modifiable through supplementation with selenomethionine and magnesium citrate as well as by acupuncture and manual medicine methods.\nA direct correlation between whole blood selenium and serum magnesium was found in subjects without thyroid disease and in menopausal women while it was reversed in cases of thyroid diseases as well as in patients with depression, infection, and in infertile women. Vascularization indices were elevated in cases of newly diagnosed benign thyroid diseases. Musculoskeletal changes i.e. lateral tension and idiopathic moving toes, as well as situations of physical and psychological stress and minor trauma and infection led to an increase of vascularization. Magnesium levels correlated negatively with these two conditions. The supplementation brought a reduction of the vascularization indices and reduced the incidence of idiopathic moving toes. Treatment of lateral tension required manual medicine methods and acupuncture (gastrocnemius). A small subgroup of patients showed a further reduction of hyper-vascularization after receiving coenzyme Q10.\nWe interpret the elevated thyroid vascularization and low magnesium levels as signs of an inflammatory process related to the musculoskeletal changes. Improvement of thyroid function and morphology can be achieved after correcting the influence of stressors together with the supplementation regime. We hypothesize that the central biochemical event in thyroid disease is that of an acquired, altered mitochondrial function due to deficiency of magnesium, selenium, and coenzyme Q10.", "journal": "BBA clinical", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["RoyMoncayo", "HelgaMoncayo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbacli.2014.11.002"}

Yet tumors survive these challenges and acquire highly energy-demanding traits, such as overgrowth and invasiveness. In this review we focus on stresses that occur in cancer cells and discuss them in the context of mTOR signaling. Of note, many tumor traits require mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, but mTORC1 hyperactivation eventually sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Thus, mTORC1 activity needs to be balanced in cancer cells.

We reviewed the history of free flap use in oral and maxillofacial surgery and show their place in the wider context of surgical progress. An overview is given of both soft tissue and bony reconstruction in the pre-free flap era and the development of vascular anastomosis and microsurgery--one of the main foundations of free flap surgery. The emergence of free flaps from 1959 through to the early 1970s is documented. The history of 19 of the more common free flaps used in oral and maxillofacial surgery is described, from the jejunal flap in 1959 through to the posterior tibial artery flap in 1985. For each, the origin and first reported use in the head and neck are discussed. Free flap surgery has continued to evolve, with developments in perforator and chimeric flaps, and new flaps continue to be described. An appreciation of the surgical history is important in understanding where we are today.

Tumor weight and disease stage are still the most used indicators to prognosis and guidance of clinical decisions. Histology has not added meaningful data for risk stratification and management. ACT is metabolically active, highly vascularized, locally invasive and has the propensity to produce distant metastasis. Our objective was to correlate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) with clinical and prognostic aspects in pediatric ACT.\nIn 27 tumors, immunohistochemical expression of VEGF, CD105 (endoglin) and CD34 was analyzed. MVD was determined by CD34 and CD105 antibodies. MVD and VEGF expression was correlated with clinical characteristics and outcome. Normal pediatric glands were used as controls.\nEndoglin MVD was significantly higher and CD34 MVD was significantly lower in ACT than control. The VEGF expression did not differ between groups. Cytoplasmic staining for endoglin was correlated with hypertension in ACT. Endoglin MVD greater than 1 mv/field, CD34 MVD less than 32 mv/field and VEGF expression levels above 4.8% were associated with clinical and biological indicators of poor prognosis.\nEndoglin and CD34 MVD values are potential histological markers to refine the histologic classification of pediatric ACT.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric surgery", "date": "2015-03-19", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Ivan Bradley dos SantosDias", "Camila GirardiFachin", "Lucimar Retto SilvaAv\u00f3", "Caio Vinicius Gon\u00e7alvesFraz\u00e3o", "Eliana Maria MonteiroCaran", "S\u00e9rgio TomazSchettini", "Maria Teresa SeixasAlves", "Raul CRibeiro", "Simone de Campos VieiraAbib"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2014.12.006"}
{"title": "Biliary tract anatomy and its relationship with venous drainage.", "abstract": "Portal cavernoma develops as a bunch of hepatopetal collaterals in response to portomesenteric venous obstruction and induces morphological changes in the biliary ducts, referred to as portal cavernoma cholangiopathy. This article briefly reviews the available literature on the vascular supply of the biliary tract in the light of biliary changes induced by portal cavernoma. Literature pertaining to venous drainage of the biliary tract is scanty whereas more attention was focused on the arterial supply probably because of its significant surgical implications in liver transplantation and development of ischemic changes and strictures in the bile duct due to vasculobiliary injuries. Since the general pattern of arterial supply and venous drainage of the bile ducts is quite similar, the arterial supply of the biliary tract is also reviewed. Fine branches from the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal, retroportal, gastroduodenal, hepatic and cystic arteries form two plexuses to supply the bile ducts. The paracholedochal plexus, as right and left marginal arteries, run along the margins of the bile duct and the reticular epicholedochal plexus lie on the surface. The retropancreatic, hilar and intrahepatic parts of biliary tract has copious supply, but the supraduodenal bile duct has the poorest vascularization and hence susceptible to ischemic changes. Two venous plexuses drain the biliary tract. A fine reticular epicholedochal venous plexus on the wall of the bile duct drains into the paracholedochal venous plexus (also called as marginal veins or parabiliary venous system) which in turn is connected to the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein, gastrocolic trunk, right gastric vein, superior mesenteric vein inferiorly and intrahepatic portal vein branches superiorly. These pericholedochal venous plexuses constitute the porto-portal collaterals and dilate in portomesenteric venous obstruction forming the portal cavernoma.", "journal": "Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["Chittapuram SRamesh Babu", "MalaySharma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jceh.2013.05.002"}

The group 1 patients underwent partial ACL reconstruction, while those in group 2 and group 3 underwent complete ACL reconstruction, performed using either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts, respectively. The subjective outcome was evaluated using the Lysholm knee scale and the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain assessment and sporting activity was rated using the Tegner activity scale. Objective evaluation was performed using the IKDC objective form, KT-1000 arthrometer and KiRA triaxial accelerometer.\nat the follow-up evaluation, the mean subjective IKDC score was 86.1\u00b110.3 in group 1, 85.2\u00b111.1 in group 2, and 82.7\u00b17.8 in group 3.

{"title": "Omental transposition in treatment of severe ocular surface alkaline burn: an experimental study.", "abstract": "Since alkaline substances can rapidly penetrate into the cornea and subsequently damage limbal stem cells, another source of stem cells may be necessary to reconstruct the ocular surface. Omentum has some such characteristics like ability to regenerate tissue as well as anti-inflammatory capacity. Presence of adult stem cells and pluripotent embryonic cell markers make it suitable in wound healing; therefore, it seems reasonable to evaluate whether omentum can be helpful to restoration of ocular surface in severe alkaline burn. In this experimental trial, two groups of dogs (5 in each) were assigned. Following ethics approval, ocular surface alkaline burn was induced in both groups by placing filter papers soaked with NaOH (0.5 mol/l) on the cornea of one eye. Subsequently, group 1 (n=5) was treated only by conventional therapy; group 2 (n=5) was treated with omental elongation and transposition to the injured eye immediately following injury. Both groups were followed for six months. Ocular surface was evaluated by slit lamp microscope and corneal clarity was assessed and graded. At the end of six months, corneal opacity and vascularization were significantly reduced in group 2 (p-values of 0.009, 0.049, and 0.032 for corneal opacity, fluorescein staining, and vascularization grades, respectively).

The reconstruction of both the nasolabial and perinasal regions may be especially complex and challenging for the surgeon. Traditionally, these defects have been reconstructed with local random flaps based on the vascularization provided by the superficial musculoaponeurotic system. In this article, we present our experience in the reconstruction of the aforementioned defects using the propeller facial artery perforator (FAP) flap.\nA propeller FAP flap was performed for reconstruction in 12 patients with nasolabial or perinasal complex defects after tumoral resection between the years 2011 and 2013. The flap was designed parallel to the nasolabial fold in all cases for achieving direct closure and an aesthetically pleasing outcome. In one of the cases, a paramedian forehead flap was performed simultaneously.\nNine patients healed uneventfully, with good functional and esthetic outcomes. One of the flaps developed partial necrosis of the distal end, and another developed temporary postoperative venous congestion, lymphedema, and, finally, trapdoor deformity. The latter complication also occurred in one more flap.\nThe propeller FAP flap is reliable and versatile, with few complications, and it is especially useful when reconstructing complex defects that involve the nasolabial and perinasal regions; therefore, it should be considered as one of the first reconstructive options for the described defects.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["ARuiz-Moya", "ALagares-Borrego", "PInfante-Coss\u00edo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2014.12.003"}

A Haas appliance was used for the rapid expansion of the midpalatal suture; rapid expansion was set for 2 weeks and fixed for 4 weeks. The tissue of the maxillary midpalatal suture was harvested on the day of installing rapid expansion (control 0 group), on weeks 1 and 2 for rapid expansion, and on weeks 1, 2, and 4 for fixed (experimental group and control group, respectively). The immunohistochemical method was used to detect distribution and expression of VEGF, and new bone formation was observed with periodic acid-Schiff.\nHigher VEGF expressions are observed after midpalatal suture distraction osteogenesis. Positive staining for VEGF is mainly noted in the vascular endothelial cells, and the active osteoblasts are at the edge of a newborn trabecular bone. A weak VEGF expression is detected among cells in the control group. The VEGF expression of the experimental group is higher than that of the control group in rapid expansion weeks 1 and 2 and in fixed weeks 1 and 2. The expression of VEGF in the experimental group increases significantly and peaks at fixed week 1, and then gradually decreases. The amount of newly formed bone in the experimental groups is always higher than that in the control group; moreover, it increases significantly and peaks at fixed week 2, and then gradually decreases.\nThe mechanical strain created by rapid maxillary expansion generates a sequence of VEGF cellular events that lead to increased vascularization and subsequent new bone formation.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0a\u988c\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f13\u6269\u5f20\u671f\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u671f\u5154\u816d\u4e2d\u7f1d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08VEGF\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u8fbe\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u9aa8\u5f62\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\n\u5c0644\u53ea\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u5927\u767d\u5154\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a11\u7ec4\uff1a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\uff08\u51715\u7ec4\uff09\u3001\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08\u51715\u7ec4\uff09\u3001\u5bf9\u71670\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec44\u53ea\u3002\u7528\u87ba\u65cb\u5206\u88c2\u57fa\u6258\u6269\u5927\u77eb\u6cbb\u5668\uff08Haas\u77eb\u6b63\u5668\uff09\u6269\u5f20\u5154\u4e0a\u7259\u5f13\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f202\u5468\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a4\u5468\u3002\u5728\u5b89\u88c5\u6269\u5f20\u5668\u5f53\u5929\uff08\u5bf9\u71670\u7ec4\uff09\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7b2c1\u30012\u5468\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b2c1\u30012\u30014\u5468\uff08\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff09\u53d6\u5154\u4e0a\u988c\u9aa8\u816d\u4e2d\u7f1d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5316\u5b66\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4bVEGF\u5728\u816d\u4e2d\u7f1d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7898\u9178-Schiff\u67d3\u8272\u6cd5\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b0\u9aa8\u5f62\u6210\u3002\n\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u816d\u4e2d\u7f1d\u53ef\u89c1\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684VEGF\u8868\u8fbe\uff0cVEGF\u9633\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3b\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u80de\u6d46\u548c\u589e\u6b96\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u6210\u9aa8\u7ec6\u80de\u80de\u6d46\u3002\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4VEGF\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5747\u5448\u5f31\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7b2c1\u5468\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7b2c2\u5468\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b2c1\u5468\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b2c2\u5468VEGF\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u91cf\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u968f\u7740\u673a\u68b0\u5e94\u529b\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4VEGF\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u91cf\u9010\u6e10\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a1\u5468\u8fbe\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u65b0\u9aa8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u65b0\u9aa8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u9010\u6e10\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a2\u5468\u8fbe\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n\u4e0a\u988c\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f13\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7275\u5f20\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bfc\u81f4VEGF\u751f\u6210\u589e\u52a0\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8840\u7ba1\u53ca\u65b0\u9aa8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "journal": "Hua xi kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Huaxi kouqiang yixue zazhi = West China journal of stomatology", "date": "2015-02-11", "authors": ["ZhangWeibing", "LinWang"], "doi": "10.7518/hxkq.2014.06.007"}

Baseline visual acuity (VA) was tabulated and analysis of the RPE tear was performed with multimodal imaging. Follow-up VA, progression of the tear, and severity of fibrosis were evaluated, and each was correlated with number of anti-VEGF injections.\nAverage follow-up for the 56 eyes was 42 months, and mean logMAR VA at baseline was 0.88 (Snellen VA 20/150) with minimal decline over 3 years. LogMAR VA plotted against number of anti-VEGF injections demonstrated that more frequent and cumulative injections correlated with better VA (P<.0001). A greater number of anti-VEGF injections was associated with minimal progression of the RPE tear, reduced fibrosis, and lower risk of a large, end-stage exudative disciform scar.\nFifteen to 20% of vascularized pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) may develop RPE tears after anti-VEGF therapy due to progressive contraction of the type 1 choroidal neovascular membrane in a PED at risk. Continued monitoring of RPE tears for exudative changes warranting anti-VEGF therapy may stabilize VA, improve anatomical outcomes, reduce fibrosis, and decrease the risk of developing a large blinding end-stage exudative disciform scar.", "journal": "Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society", "date": "2015-02-04", "authors": ["DavidSarraf", "AnthonyJoseph", "EhsanRahimy"], "doi": null}

Nineteen eyes of 19 patients with active leaking and exudation underwent a prospective open-label trial of monthly high-dose intravitreal ranibizumab (2.0 mg/0.05 mL). The primary outcome was prevention of major vision loss (\u226415 ETDRS letters). Secondary outcomes included adverse events, improved vision, and changes in subretinal hemorrhage, subretinal fluid, macular edema, and polypoidal complexes at 6 months.\nThe PCV vessels were localized beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and above Bruch's membrane in 103 (99%) of 104 eyes. In the high-dose ranibizumab trial at 6 months, none of the patients lost \u226515 letters in visual acuity, and 5 (26%) of 19 gained \u226515 letters. Decreases were noted in subretinal fluid in 14 (82%) of 17 eyes, subretinal hemorrhage in 12 (100%) of 12, RPE detachment in 14 (88%) of 16, macular edema in 11 (92%) of 12, and polyps in 15 (79%) of 19 eyes.\nPCV vessels are a subtype of subretinal neovascularization located above Bruch's membrane and below RPE.

In 4 cases, there was a lack of blood supply at the first evaluation but an initial good clinical scar correction. The absence of blood vessels was confirmed at 3 months accompanied by complete resorption of the transferred fat with a failure of good clinical outcome.\nContrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to evaluate the microvasculature of adipose tissue after fat transfer.

{"title": "The role of notch in the cardiovascular system: potential adverse effects of investigational notch inhibitors.", "abstract": "Targeting the Notch pathway is a new promising therapeutic approach for cancer patients. Inhibition of Notch is effective in the oncology setting because it causes a reduction of highly proliferative tumor cells and it inhibits survival of cancer stem cells, which are considered responsible for tumor recurrence and metastasis. Additionally, since Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)-activated Notch signaling is a major modulator of angiogenesis, anti-Dll4 agents are being investigated to reduce vascularization of the tumor. Notch plays a major role in the heart during the development and, after birth, in response to cardiac damage. Therefore, agents used to inhibit Notch in the tumors (gamma secretase inhibitors and anti-Dll4 agents) could potentially affect myocardial repair. The past experience with trastuzumab and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for cancer therapy demonstrates that the possible cardiotoxicity of agents targeting shared pathways between cancer and heart and the vasculature should be considered. To date, Notch inhibition in cancer patients has resulted only in mild gastrointestinal toxicity. Little is known about the potential long-term cardiotoxicity associated to Notch inhibition in cancer patients. In this review, we will focus on mechanisms through which inhibition of Notch signaling could lead to cardiomyocytes and endothelial dysfunctions. These adverse effects could contrast with the benefits of therapeutic responses in cancer cells during times of increased cardiac stress and/or in the presence of cardiovascular risk factor.", "journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["PaolaRizzo", "DonatoMele", "CristianaCaliceti", "MicaelaPannella", "CinziaFortini", "Anthony GeorgeClementz", "Marco BrunoMorelli", "GiorgioAquila", "PietroAmeri", "RobertoFerrari"], "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2014.00384\n10.1093/jnci/djp440\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.121\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs181\n10.1200/JCO.20.5.1215\n10.1002/cncr.11407\n10.1124/pr.56.2.6\n10.1007/s10549-014-2997-4\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.03.019\n10.1007/s00432-008-0372-8\n10.1038/nm.2919\n10.1111/bcp.12429\n10.1016/S1734-1140(09)70018-0\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1084/jem.20081427\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.039\n10.1073/pnas.0500169102\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.902221\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.895771\n10.1126/science.3798106\n10.1517/14728220802517935\n10.1016/j.echo.2014.01.014\n10.4065/83.2.197\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.205906\n10.1185/03007995.2013.807232\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.0463\n10.1200/JCO.2005.13.300\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079543\n10.1007/s12282-014-0543-1\n10.1002/path.4052\n10.1038/nrg3272\n10.1128/MCB.25.4.1458-1474.2005\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2009.03279.x\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.02.003\n10.4161/cc.11.2.18995\n10.1016/j.bcp.2010.07.010\n10.1038/labinvest.3700700\n10.1186/bcr2900\n10.1016/j.advenzreg.2009.01.008\n10.1186/2045-824X-4-7\n10.1038/onc.2008.226\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2823\n10.1007/978-1-4614-0899-4_23\n10.1177/1947601911423030\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61763-4\n10.1016/S0925-4773(01)00469-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.179044\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.01.010\n10.1016/j.devcel.2012.01.014\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.164749\n10.1038/mt.2013.137\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs269\n10.3109/14017431.2010.511256\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.233262\n10.1161/01.RES.85.2.199\n10.1073/pnas.97.16.9052\n10.1161/hc0902.104353\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00432-5\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a015068\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000045665.57256.86\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.19.1983\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008244\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.174995\n10.1167/iovs.10-7061\n10.1161/01.RES.0000254788.47304.6e\n10.1128/MCB.24.20.8813-8822.2004\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2013.12.009\n10.1038/ncomms4838\n10.1038/nm.3487\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4038\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.04.021\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.079\n10.1042/BST0371233\n10.1038/onc.2008.227\n10.1186/2040-2384-2-3\n10.1038/ncb2926\n10.1038/nature10908\n10.1093/cvr/cvt170\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303142\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.218271\n10.1007/s10456-013-9366-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301407\n10.1007/s11239-010-0543-8\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.754978\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007572\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.553917\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.051\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.01.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029863\n10.1161/01.RES.0000044944.99984.25\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.225144\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052833\n10.1038/383707a0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06178-5\n10.1038/hr.2013.52\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083310\n10.1038/nm1459\n10.1096/fj.04-1700fje\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1007/s10741-010-9181-7\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000287\n10.1016/j.healun.2007.08.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.813493\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203034\n10.1016/j.hlc.2013.07.004\n10.1083/jcb.200806104\n10.1073/pnas.2132126100\n10.1073/pnas.1208114109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.218487\n10.1083/jcb.200806091\n10.1073/pnas.0808357105\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136813.89036.21\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01195.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.151381\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.947531\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.182\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.1.238\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-0685\n10.3892/mmr.2013.1657\n10.1586/14737175.4.2.255\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl446\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.675462\n10.1073/pnas.1116889109\n10.1038/leu.2009.75\n10.1182/blood-2006-07-034405\n10.2165/00002018-200831060-00002"}

The posterior pole sparing laser with IVB was performed with zone I, stage 3+ ROP at the mean postmenstrual age of 36 weeks and 5 days. The plus sign decreased significantly at postoperative day 1, the neovascular proliferation regressed by postoperative week 1, and the normal vascularization started at postoperative day 32 on the average. Two months after treatment, vascularization of the spared avascular area was completed. There was no macular dragging, tractional retinal detachment, foveal destruction by laser scars, or any other adverse event.

As in other malignancies, nor etiology, neither pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are well known. The link between inflammation and colorectal cancer has become a major concern in the past 20 years, since several clinical trials have shown that patients with chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases have a much higher risk of colorectal neoplasm development. In our study, we analyzed peritumoral inflammatory reaction from histological and immunohistochemical point of view, in 23 cases of stage III colon adenocarcinoma, operated during 2014. The immunohistochemical techniques were used in order to emphasize B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells and blood vessels. In all cases, we have noted the involvement of inflammatory cells present in peritumoral and tumoral stroma, in variable degrees, regardless the differentiation of the neoplasm or other known histological feature. In particular, the macrophages were the most numerous, especially in areas of tumoral necrosis, but also present in the lumen of tumoral glands, or even within tumoral cell islands. Mast cells appeared more abundant in the tumor stroma around blood vessels and were absent in the areas of tumor necrosis, while B-cells were almost absent.

{"title": "Correlation between semiquantitative sonoelastography and immunohistochemistry in the evaluation of testicular focal lesions.", "abstract": "Sonoelastography is a novel and promising imaging tool, which has been applied to breast, thyroid, and prostate tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate focal lesions of the testes with diameters of <10\u00a0mm using sonoelastography, B-mode sonography (US), and colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDU).\nThirty patients who were referred to our outpatient clinics for varicocoeles, scrotal pain, scrotal enlargements, epididymitis, palpable testicular nodules, or infertility, were prospectively enrolled into this study. Ultrasound evaluations had revealed that 27 subjects had focal testicular lesions with diameters of <10\u00a0mm and 3 subjects had 10-mm spherical non-homogeneous testicular nodules. All lesions were evaluated using semiquantitative sonoelastography, and the patients underwent orchifunicolectomies. The testicular lesions were examined histopathologically. The vascularization of the lesions and the surrounding testicular parenchyma was evaluated by analysing the immunohistochemical distribution of the cluster of differentiation 31 and by calculating the vascular indices (VI). Potential associations between the strain ratios (stiffness of the lesions) and the VI were tested.\nAnalyses of the strain fields obtained using semiquantitative sonoelastography yielded different values for the masses and the surrounding tissues, which led to significant increases in the strain ratios. Sonoelastography upheld all of the diagnoses that were suspected when the patients were physically examined, when the serum markers were analysed, and after the patients had undergone US and CDU. Histopathological examinations confirmed the neoplastic characteristics of these masses. A significant inverse correlation was determined between the sonoelastographic strain ratio and the VI (Pearson correlation coefficient, r, =\u2009-\u20090.93; P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nOur investigation shows that semiquantitative sonoelastography may provide additional objective information to support the algorithm used to diagnose testicular lesions.

Adipose tissue was collected from both inguinal regions of two SD rats to isolate, culture, and purify ADSCs through collagen enzyme digestion, density gradient centrifugation, and adherence method. The fourth passage of cells were collected for morphologic observation, detection of expressions of surface markers CD34, CD49d, CD106, and CD45 of ADSCs with flow cytometer, identification of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and determination of the cell proliferation ability with thiazolyl blue method. (2) Experiment 2. Another 30 SD rats were divided into allogeneic adipose granule (AG) group (A, n = 6), autologous AG group (B, n = 8), autologous ADSCs+autologous AG group (C, n = 8), and allogeneic ADSCs+autologous AG group (D, n = 8) according to the random number table. The fourth passage of ADSCs were obtained from adipose tissue from one side of inguinal region of SD rats in group C. Adipose tissue obtained from one side of inguinal region of SD rats of the other 3 groups was abandoned. The AG was prepared from another side of inguinal region of SD rats in the 4 groups. The mixture of 0.6 g AG from one rat and 1 mL DMEM/F12 nutrient solution was injected subcutaneously into the back of another rat in group A, and so on. Autologous AG was injected into its own body of the rats in group B. The mixture of 1 mL autologous ADSCs mixture which contains 3.0 \u00d7 10\u2076 cells per mililitre autologous ADSCs combined with autologous AG was injected into the rats in group C. The mixture of 1 mL allogeneic ADSCs mixture which contains 3.0 \u00d7 10\u2076 cells per mililitre ADSCs extractived from the former 2 rats in experiment 1 combined with autologous AG was injected into the rats in group D.

She complained of having distorted vision in her left eye. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable. At the initial examination, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes, and the intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg in both eyes. A slit-lamp examination showed no abnormalities in the anterior segment of both eyes and a fundus examination of the left eye showed a slightly elevated juxtafoveal chorioretinal lesion and polyp-like reddish-orange lesions. The juxtafoveal choroidal lesion was located beneath a choroidal neovascularization (CNV). An optical coherence tomography confirmed CNV with pigment epithelial detachment (PED). Fluorescein angiography showed juxtafoveal hyperfluorescence due to CNV. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated a branching choroidal vascular network that resembled polypoidal lesions. A fundus autofluorescence showed a mosaic pattern and a slight hyperautofluorescence at the CNV. We diagnosed the patient as having PCV. Aflibercept was injected intravitreally because of her PED. After the injection, PED improved and her visual acuity remained stable during the 12-month follow-up period.\nIn cases of PCV, FAF images are helpful in determining the status of the posterior pole.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the antitumor mechanism of rapamycin, hypothetically via apoptotic promotion, using MCF-7 breast cancer cells.\nMCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 15105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 24h, cells were treated with a series of concentrations of rapamycin while only adding DMEM medium with PEG for the control regiment and grown at 37oC, 5% CO2 and 95% air for 72h. Trypan blue was used to determine the cell viability and proliferation. Untreated and rapamycin-treated MCF-7 cells were also examined for morphological changes with an inverted-phase contrast microscope. Alteration in cell morphology was ascertained, along with a stage in the cell cycle and proliferation. In addition, cytotoxicity testing was performed using normal mouse breast mammary pads.\nOur results clearly showed that rapamycin exhibited inhibitory activity on MCF-7 cell lines. The IC50 value of rapamycin on the MCF-7 cells was determined as 0.4\u03bcg/ml (p<0.05). Direct observation by inverted microscopy demonstrated that the MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin showed characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage, vascularization and autophagy. Cells underwent early apoptosis up to 24% after 72h. Analysis of the cell cycle showed an increase in the G0G1 phase cell population and a corresponding decrease in the S and G2M phase populations, from 81.5% to 91.3% and 17.3% to 7.9%, respectively.\nThis study demonstrated that rapamycin may potentially act as an anti-cancer agent via the inhibition of growth with some morphological changes of the MCF-7 cancer cells, arrest cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis in late stage of apoptosis.

Development of new biomaterials with suitable biocompatibility and seal has changed the attitudes towards preserving the reversible pulp in cariously exposed teeth. Before exposure and irreversible involvement of the pulp, indirect pulp capping (IPC) is the treatment of choice, but after the spread of inflammation within the pulp chamber and establishment of irreversible pulpitis, removal of inflamed pulp tissue is recommended.

In addition, grafted cells must be functionally integrated into host tissue to effectively repair cardiac function. Because of its size and physiological function, the metabolic needs of the heart are considerable. Therefore grafts must contain not only cardiomyocytes but also a functional vascular network to meet their needs for oxygen and nutrition.

Our previous studies revealed that FMOD deficiency led to marked alterations in adult wound healing characterized by delayed dermal cell migration, postponed wound closure, and increased scar formation, all accompanied by impeded angiogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to reveal the effect of FMOD on angiogenesis during the wound-healing process.\nIn vivo angiogenic effects of FMOD were assessed by a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, a Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) plug implant assay, and rodent primary closure wound models. In vitro angiogenic effects of FMOD were recorded by cell invasion and dimensional and topological parameters of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\nWe provided evidence that FMOD significantly enhanced vascularization: first, FMOD boosted blood vessel formation on the chorioallantoic membrane; second, FMOD markedly stimulated capillary infiltration into Matrigel plugs subcutaneously implanted in adult mice; and finally, FMOD robustly promoted angiogenesis in multiple adult rodent cutaneous wound models. Furthermore, FMOD administration restored the vascularity of fmod (-/-) mouse wounds. In support of this, FMOD endorsed an angiogenesis-favored microenvironment in adult rodent wounds not only by upregulating angiogenic genes but also by downregulating angiostatic genes. In addition, FMOD significantly enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell invasion and tube-like structure formation in vitro.\nAltogether, we demonstrated that in addition to reducing scar formation, FMOD also promotes angiogenesis.

This historical control study tests the hypothesis that the use of radio frequency thermocoagulation (RFT) during surgery improves outcome.\nFrom November 2010 to October 2011, 20 giant vascularized meningiomas were surgically resected with intraoperative use of ultrasound-guided RFT prior to resection. The historical control group consisted of 25 patients in whom tumors were removed without RFT by the same surgical team. Blood loss during resection, changes in tumor consistency, time taken for the operation, and the extent of resection were compared between the two groups.\nThere was less blood lost during resection and the duration of the operation was shorter in RFT-assisted surgery than in the historical control group (P<0.05). Apart from the effect of devascularization, the tumor consistency became soft after RFT, which could also be beneficial.\nSatisfactory devascularization and tumor softening were achieved after RFT without incremental complications.

{"title": "A potential translational approach for bone tissue engineering through endochondral ossification.", "abstract": "Bone defect repair is a significant clinical challenge in orthopedic surgery. Despite tremendous efforts, the majority of the current bone tissue engineering strategies depend on bone formation via intramembranous ossification (IO), which often results in poor vascularization and limited-area bone regeneration. Recently, there has been increasing interest in exploring bone regeneration through a cartilage-mediated process similar to endochondral ossification (EO). This method is advantageous because long bones are originally developed through EO and moreover, vascularization is an inherent step of this process. Therefore, it may be possible to effectively employ the EO method for the repair and regeneration of large and segmental bone defects. Although a number of studies have demonstrated engineered bone formation through EO, there are no approaches aiming for their clinical translation. In this study, we propose a strategy modeled after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved autologus chondrocyte implantation (ACI) procedure.

One application involves seeding MSCs in biomaterial scaffolds to promote osteogenesis in the repair of bone defects following implantation. However, predicting in vivo survival and differentiation of MSCs in biomaterials is challenging. Rapid and stable vascularization of scaffolds is required to supply nutrients and oxygen that MSCs need to survive as well as to go through osteogenic differentiation. The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based model and simulator that can be used to investigate the effects of using gradient growth factors on survival and differentiation of MSCs seeded in scaffolds. An agent-based model is developed to simulate the MSC behavior. The effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) on both survival and osteogenic differentiation is studied. Results showed that the survival ratio of MSCs can be enhanced by increasing VEGF concentration. BMP-2 caused a slight increase on survival ratio. Osteogenesis strongly depends on the VEGF concentration as well because of its effect on vascularization.

The promotion of transplant neovascularization soon after autologous free fat grafts may reduce these outcomes. In adulthood, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its membrane receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) are involved in the homing and migration of multiple stem cell types, neovascularization, and cell proliferation. We hypothesized that CXCR4 may improve the long-term survival of free fat tissue transplants by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and may therefore improve graft revascularization. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of human breast adipose-derived stem cells (HBASCs) transfected with the CXCR4 gene on the survival rate of human autologous free fat transplants in nude mice.\nHuman breast adipose-derived stem cells (HBASCs) were expanded ex vivo for 3 passages, labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transfected with CXCR4 or left untransfected. Autologous fat tissues were mixed with the GFP-labeled, CXCR4-transfected HBASCs (group A), GFP-labeled HBASCs (group B), the known vascularization-promoting agent VEGF (group C), or medium (group D) and then injected subcutaneously into 32 nude mice at 4 spots in a random fashion. Six months later, the transplanted tissue volume and histology were evaluated, and neo-vascularization was quantified by counting the capillaries. CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression in the transplants was determined using real-time quantitative PCR analysis (qPCR).\nThe data revealed that the control (group D) transplant volume survival was 28.3 \u00b1 4.5%. Mixing CXCR4-transfected (group A) and untransfected (group B) HBASCs significantly increased transplant volume survival (79.5 \u00b1 8.3% and 67.2 \u00b1 5.9%, respectively), whereas VEGF-transfected HBASCs (group C) were less effective (41.2 \u00b1 5.1%). Histological analysis revealed that both types of HBASCs-treated transplants consisted predominantly of adipose tissue, unlike the control transplants, and also presented significantly less fat necrosis and fibrosis. The CXCR4-transfected HBASCs-treated transplants had a significantly higher capillary density than did the other transplants and showed GFP and CD31 double-positive cells (i.e., ASCs-derived endothelial cells). The mRNA expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 was much higher in the CXCR4-transfected HBASCs transplants than in the other three transplants.\nOur data demonstrated that HBASCs can enhance the survival and quality of transplanted free fat tissues. Moreover, CXCR4 transfection of these HBASCs could augment this effect. Stimulation of angiogenesis and decreased fat cell apoptosis due to the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and an increase in graft revascularization are potential mechanisms underlying the improved long-term survival of free fat transplants following CXCR4-transfected HBASCs treatment.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2015-01-07", "authors": ["Fang-tianXu", "Hong-mianLi", "Qing-ShuiYin", "Da-lieLiu", "HuaNan", "Pei-ranZhao", "Shuang-wuLiang"], "doi": "10.1159/000366404"}
{"title": "Involvement of reactive oxygen species in the mechanisms associated with cervical cancer specific treatment.", "abstract": "Cervical cancer represents a genuine health issue in Romania.The courses of treatment applied are complex, and the accompanying biochemical mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. Thus, radiotherapy, which induces reactive oxygen species, can lead to failure of treatment in hypoxic tissues,tissues which are difficult to identify due to the small quantity in which these cytotoxic species are produced. As a result, the aim of this paper is to identify the production and role of reactive oxygen species, as well as the manner of activation of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms in cervical cancer patients admitted to the Oncologic Institute of Bucharest. To this purpose the biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were identified in 30 patients with cervical tumour localization, prior to surgery. The results obtained have showed that a production of reactive oxygen species is identifiable in these patients, having lipids as a primary target and leading to their peroxidation. The extension of protein oxidative degradation takes place at a much lower value, as well as the activation of endogenous antioxidant defence systems, comparing to our expectations. To conclude,we consider that when the production of active oxygen metabolites takes place in small concentrations, associated with hypoxia, the signals transmitted are towards modifying the phenotype under anaerobic conditions into one activating neo vascularization, angiogenesis initiation, new cell growth and proliferation. The moment that this phase is overcome anew oxidative stress is installed, one potentially destructive for biomolecules essential to life, but also useful for further treatment, such as radiotherapy.", "journal": "Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)", "date": "2015-01-07", "authors": ["SMarinescu", "RAnghel", "M IGruia", "MBeuran"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Mouse model of CADASIL reveals novel insights into Notch3 function in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.", "abstract": "Could impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis be a relevant mechanism underlying CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)? Memory symptoms in CADASIL, the most common hereditary form of vascular dementia, are usually thought to be primarily due to vascular degeneration and white matter lacunes. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process essential for the integration of new spatial memory occurs in a highly vascularized niche, we considered dysregulation of adult neurogenesis as a potential mechanism for the manifestation of dementia in CADASIL. Analysis in aged mice overexpressing Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation, revealed vascular deficits in arteries of the hippocampal fissure but not in the niche of the dentate gyrus. At 12 months of age, cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons were reduced not only in CADASIL mice but also in transgenic controls overexpressing wild type Notch3. At 6 months, hippocampal neurogenesis was altered in CADASIL mice independent of overt vascular abnormalities in the fissure. Further, we identified Notch3 expression in hippocampal precursor cells and maturing neurons in vivo as well as in cultured hippocampal precursor cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that Notch3 signaling negatively regulated precursor cell proliferation. Notch3 overexpression also led to deficits in KCl-induced precursor cell activation. This suggests a cell-autonomous effect of Notch3 signaling in the regulation of precursor proliferation and activation and a loss-of-function effect in CADASIL. Consequently, besides vascular damage, aberrant precursor cell proliferation and differentiation due to Notch3 dysfunction might be an additional independent mechanism for the development of hippocampal dysfunction in CADASIL.", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "date": "2015-01-04", "authors": ["FannyEhret", "SteffenVogler", "SherinPojar", "David AElliott", "FrankBradke", "BarbaraSteiner", "GerdKempermann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2014.12.018"}
{"title": "Increased glucocerebrosidase expression and activity in preeclamptic placenta.", "abstract": "Lysosomal glucosidase beta acid (GBA) deficiency is inherent to Gaucher disease, Parkinsonism and Lewy-body dementia. Increased GBA expression has never been associated with human disease. We describe increased GBA expression and activity in placenta from preeclamptic pregnancies.\n112 placenta biopsies were available for qPCR, analysis of GBA gene expression and activity. Microanalysis was performed on 20 placenta samples. Alternatively spliced placental GBA transcripts were cloned, expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed by Western blot and activity assay.\nGBA is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of human placenta already at 5 weeks of gestation. We identified five novel GBA transcripts in placenta that enzymatically inactive when expressed in HEK293 cells. Both GBA RNA expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated in preeclamptic placenta. Microarray analysis of 20 placenta tissues identified 158 genes co-regulating with GBA expression and gene enrichment analysis highlights lysosomal function. In our micro-array data GBA expression does not correlate with FLT1 expression, currently the most powerful marker for preeclampsia. There are 89 transcripts that are negatively correlated with GBA expression of which BMP4 and TFEB are interesting as they are essential to early placenta function.\nAlthough very speculative, we hypothesize that increased GBA expression might relate to placentation through decreased BMP4 signaling or vascularization through downregulation of TFEB. Ceramide, the product of hydrolysis of glucosylceramide by GBA and involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, survival and apoptosis, is another putative candidate linking increased GBA activity to preeclampsia.

But whether this approach is also suitable for tumors extending laterally to the temporal lobe or middle cranial fossa is not clarified. We would like to share our experiences from the cadaveric anatomy study to clinical operations. We used 5 cadavers to study trans-eyelid approaches in a step-by-step fashion. And then assisted by an experienced ophthalmologist for incisions, we treated 3 female patients via this approach: One with spheno-orbital meningioma, one with sellar tuberculum meningioma, and the other with medial sphenoidal wing meningioma. After studying the cadavers, we made several revisions to the previously reported approach: 1) move the incision close to the edge of the eyelid, which resembled the double-eyelid incision. 2) A vascularized periosteum flap was dissected for repairing the opened frontal sinus and reconstruction of the skull base. 3) The dura was sutured up with a slice of temporalis muscle. Then we treated 3 patients by this approach. All tumors were totally resected as Simpson Grade I. Complications included orbital apex syndrome and transient oculomotor paralysis because of tumor invasion into orbit and cavernous sinus. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage. We find that trans-eyelid approach is suitable for lesions not only at anterior cranial base or sellar region, but also extending to middle cranial base, especially around sphenoidal wings within 2 cm range or spheno-orbital region.

{"title": "Porcine Dermis-Derived Collagen Membranes Induce Implantation Bed Vascularization Via Multinucleated Giant Cells: A Physiological Reaction?", "abstract": "In this study, the tissue reactions to 2 new porcine dermis-derived collagen membranes of different thickness were analyzed. The thicker material (Mucoderm) contained sporadically preexisting vessel skeletons and fatty islands. The thinner membrane (Collprotect) had a bilayered structure (porous and occlusive side) without any preexisting structures. These materials were implanted subcutaneously in mice to analyze the tissue reactions and potential transmembranous vascularization. Histological and histomorphometrical methodologies were performed at 4 time points (3, 10, 15, and 30 days). Both materials permitted stepwise connective tissue ingrowth into their central regions. In the Mucoderm matrix, newly built microvessels were found within the preexisting vessel and fatty island skeletons after 30 days. This vascularization was independent of the inflammation-related vascularization on both material surfaces. The Collprotect membrane underwent material disintegration by connective tissue strands in combination with vessels and multinucleated giant cells. The histomorphometric analyses revealed that the thickness of Mucoderm did not decrease significantly, while an initial significant decrease of membrane thickness in the case of Collprotect was found at day 15. The present results demonstrate that the 2 analyzed collagen membranes underwent a multinucleated giant cell-associated vascularization. Neither of the materials underwent transmembraneous vascularization. The microvessels were found within the preexisting vessel and fatty island skeletons.

Pathology confirmed IFP, On 2 year follow up, there was no recurrence of the mass.\nA giant IFP is defined as an IFP greater than 4cm, commonly present in the distal esophagus. Pathology usually reveals vascularized fibrous stroma with elements of inflammatory infiltrate. This mass is slow-growing and asymptomatic until it grows to a large size. Common diagnostic studies include barium esophagram, upper endoscopy, and CT imaging. A key pre-operative work-up is to identify the location of the pedicle to plan out surgical approach and to avoid injuring the rich blood supply thus preventing a life threatening hemorrhage during the operation.\nGiant IFPs are infrequent in clinical practice.

In our previous studies the AV loop in the isolation chamber was discovered to undergo hypoxia, characterized by Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) up-regulation. The vascularization followed the increase of HIF-\u03b1 temporally, while it was spatially positively correlated with the HIF-\u03b1 level, as well. This study aims to prove that HIF-1a up-regulation is the stimulus for vascularization in the AV loop model.\nThe AV loop model in rats was created by interposing a femoral vein graft into the distal ends of the contralateral femoral artery and vein, and the loop was embeded in fibrin matrix and fixed in isolation chamber. PHD (prolyl hydroxylases) inhibitor DMOG (Dimethyloxallyl Glycine) was applied systemically in the rats in 40 mg/KG at day 0 and day 3 (DMOG-1), or in 15 mg/KG at day 8, day10 and day12 (DMOG-2). Two weeks later the specimens were explanted and underwent morphological and molecular evaluations.\nCompared to the control group, in the DMOG-2 group the HIF-1\u03b1 positive rate was siginicantly raised as shown in immunohistochemistry staining, accompanied with a smaller cross section area and greater vessel density, and a HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation in the kidney. The mRNA of HIF-1\u03b1 and its angiogenic target gene all increased in different extends. Ki67 IHC demostrate more positive cells. There were no significant change in the DMOG-1 group.\nBy applying DMOG systemically, HIF-1\u03b1 was up-regulated at the protein level and at the mRNA level, acompanied with angiogenic target gene up-regulateion, and the vascularization was promoted correspondingly. DMOG given at lower dosage constantly after one week tends to have better effect than the group given at larger dosage in the early stage in this model, and promotes cell proliferation, as evidenced by Ki67 IHC.

In experiment 1, buffaloes underwent synchronization of estrus and fixed-time artificial insemination (n\u00a0=\u00a023). Features of the CL were measured from Days 5 to 10 after fixed-time artificial insemination, and pregnancy was confirmed on Day 70. Buffaloes that established a pregnancy (n\u00a0=\u00a014) had a larger CL area (1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 vs. 1.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0cm(2); P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and greater progesterone (P4) concentrations (1.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 vs. 1.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during Days 5 to 10 compared with nonpregnant buffaloes. In the same period, blood flow measured as time average medium velocity tended to be greater (P\u00a0=\u00a00.059) in buffaloes that were subsequently pregnant versus nonpregnant buffaloes (10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 vs. 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9).

Blood flow was greater in HVCLs than in LVCLs. Highly vascularized CLs showed intense staining for factor VIII and had many small, irregular-shaped blood vessels, whereas LVCLs had low factor VIII staining and relatively few large, regular-shaped vessels. Luteal cell expression of vascular EGF was greater for HVCLs compared with LVCLs. The study has shown that greater development and function of the CL from as early as Day 5 is related to an increased likelihood of pregnancy in the buffalo.

Tumor parameters were quantified histologically, and the functional relevance of IGF-1R activation was analyzed in vitro.\nIMC-A12 treatment inhibited the growth of U87 and GS-12 tumors by 75% and 50%, respectively. In GS-12 tumors, the invasive tumor extension and proliferation rate were significantly reduced by IMC-A12 treatment, while apoptosis was increased. In IMC-A12-treated U87 tumors, intratumoral vascularization was markedly decreased, and tumor cell proliferation was moderately reduced.

The role of PHD3 in regulating HIF-1\u03b1 expression was further confirmed by siRNA knockdown in a PDAC cell line that highly expressed PHD3.\nThere were significantly fewer microvessels but more cancer stem cells in PDAC specimens compared to HCC specimens. The expression of CD105 was reversely related to the expression of CD44 in PDAC and HCC specimens. PDAC specimens also showed higher expressions of PHD3 but lower expressions of HIF-1\u03b1.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pro-angiogenic that is involved in tumor angiogenesis. When VEGF binds to membrane-bound vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (mVEGFR2), it promotes angiogenesis. Through alternative polyadenylation, VEGFR2 is also expressed in a soluble form (sVEGFR2). sVEGFR2 sequesters VEGF and is therefore anti-angiogenic. The aim of this study was to show that treatment with a previously developed and reported antisense morpholino oligomer that shifts expression from mVEGFR2 to sVEGFR2 would lead to reduced tumor vascularization and growth in a murine colon cancer xenograft model. Xenografts were generated by implanting human HCT-116 colon cancer cells into the flanks of NMRI nu/nu mice. Treatment with the therapeutic morpholino reduced both tumor growth and tumor vascularization. Because the HCT-116 cells used for the experiments did not express VEGFR2 and because the treatment morpholino targeted mouse rather than human VEGFR2, it is likely that treatment morpholino was acting on the mouse endothelial cells rather than directly on the tumor cells.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2014-12-24", "authors": ["Brian CStagg", "HironoriUehara", "NathanLambert", "RujuRai", "IshaGupta", "BryceRadmall", "TaylorBates", "Balamurali KAmbati"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers6042330\n10.1053/sonc.2002.37263\n10.1056/NEJMra0706596\n10.1007/s00280-014-2426-8\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65392-8\n10.4161/cbt.9.1.10282\n10.1002/pros.10163\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-288\n10.2174/138161212800626166\n10.1371/journal.pone.0081858\n10.7150/jca.6083\n10.1148/radiol.13131305\n10.1248/bpb.34.1785\n10.5483/BMBRep.2006.39.5.469\n10.5483/BMBRep.2008.41.4.278\n10.1038/nm.2018\n10.1096/fj.12-213835\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.08.009\n10.1038/mt.2010.151\n10.1007/s10620-012-2237-x\n10.1053/j.gastro.2012.06.042\n10.1007/BF01680633\n10.1002/cne.21570\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2011-300110\n10.1111/j.1442-9071.2012.02813.x\n10.3748/wjg.v19.i31.5051\n10.1007/s40259-013-0043-4\n10.1517/14728214.2013.794784\n10.1038/bjc.2013.735\n10.2174/138161212802002661\n10.2174/1568011033353452\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2797\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.11.023\n10.1038/bjc.2013.798\n10.1093/neuonc/nou148\n10.1186/bcr2903\n10.1186/2045-824X-6-12\n10.1016/j.ejca.2013.02.019\n10.2147/OTT.S65055\n10.1038/cr.2014.112\n10.1042/BJ20101490\n10.1074/jbc.M702535200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033576\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.184416"}

Patients with TNBC have typical high grading, more frequent relapses, and exhibit poorer outcomes or prognosis compared with the other subtypes of breast cancers. Currently, there are no targeted therapies that are effective for TNBC. Preclinical antitumor activity of oseltamivir phosphate (OP) therapy was investigated to identify its role in tumor neovascularization, growth, invasiveness, and long-term survival in a mouse model of human TNBC.\nLive cell sialidase, water soluble tetrazolium, WST-1 cell viability, and immunohistochemistry assays were used to evaluate sialidase activity, cell survival, and the expression levels of tumor E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and host endothelial CD31+/PECAM-1 cells in archived paraffin-embedded TNBC MDA-MB-231 tumors grown in RAGxC\u03b3 double mutant mice.\nOP, anti-Neu1 antibodies, and matrix metalloproteinase-9-specific inhibitor blocked Neu1 activity associated with EGF-stimulated TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. OP treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and their long-term tamoxifen-resistant clones reproducibly and dose-dependently reduced the sialidase activity associated with EGF-stimulated live cells and the cell viability after 72 hours of incubation. Combination of 1 \u03bcM cisplatin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or tamoxifen with OP dosages \u2265300 \u03bcg/mL significantly reduced cell viability at 24, 48, and 72 hours when compared to the chemodrug alone. Heterotopic xenografts of MDA-MB-231 tumors developed robust and bloody tumor vascularization in RAG2xC\u03b3 double mutant mice. OP treatment at 30 mg/kg daily intraperitoneally reduced tumor vascularization and growth rate as well as significantly reduced tumor weight and spread to the lungs compared with the untreated cohorts. OP treatment at 50 mg/kg completely ablated tumor vascularization, tumor growth and spread to the lungs, with significant long-term survival at day 180 postimplantation, tumor shrinking, and no relapses after 56 days off-drug. OP 30 mg/kg cohort tumors expressed significantly reduced levels of human N-cadherins and host CD31+ endothelial cells with concomitant significant expression of E-cadherins compared to the untreated cohorts.\nOP monotherapy may be the effective treatment therapy for TNBC.", "journal": "Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press)", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["FionaHaxho", "StephanieAllison", "FarahAlghamdi", "LaceyBrodhagen", "Victoria ElKuta", "SamarAbdulkhalek", "Ronald JNeufeld", "Myron RSzewczuk"], "doi": "10.2147/BCTT.S74663"}

Despite these known tendencies, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we develop a microfluidic 3D in vitro model to analyze organ-specific human breast cancer cell extravasation into bone- and muscle-mimicking microenvironments through a microvascular network concentrically wrapped with mural cells. Extravasation rates and microvasculature permeabilities were significantly different in the bone-mimicking microenvironment compared with unconditioned or myoblast containing matrices. Blocking breast cancer cell A3 adenosine receptors resulted in higher extravasation rates of cancer cells into the myoblast-containing matrices compared with untreated cells, suggesting a role for adenosine in reducing extravasation.

While studies of the postnatal evolution of the pial vasculature and blood flow through its vessels have been previously done histologically or acutely, here we describe a neonatal reinforced thin-skull preparation for longitudinally imaging the development of the pial vasculature in mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Starting with mice as young as postnatal day 2 (P2), we are able to chronically image cortical areas >1 mm(2), repeatedly for several consecutive days, allowing us to observe the remodeling of the pial arterial and venous networks. We used this method to measure blood velocity in individual vessels over multiple days, and show that blood flow through individual pial venules was correlated with subsequent diameter changes.

{"title": "Construction of three-dimensional vascularized cardiac tissue with cell sheet engineering.", "abstract": "Construction of three-dimensional (3D) tissues with pre-isolated cells is a promising achievement for novel medicine and drug-discovery research. Our laboratory constructs 3D tissues with an innovative and unique method for layering multiple cell sheets. Cell sheets maintain a high-efficiently regenerating function, because of the higher cell density and higher transplantation efficiency, compared to other cell-delivery methods. Cell sheets have already been applied in clinical applications for regenerative medicine in treating patients with various diseases. Therefore, in our search to develop a more efficient treatment with cell sheets, we are constructing 3D tissues by layering cell sheets. Native animal tissues and organs have an abundance of capillaries to supply oxygen and nutrients, and to remove waste molecules. In our investigation of vascularized cardiac cell sheets, we have found that endothelial cells within cell sheets spontaneously form blood vessel networks as in vivo capillaries. To construct even thicker 3D tissues by layering multiple cell sheets, it is critical to have a medium or blood flow within the vascular networks of the cell sheets. Therefore, to perfuse medium or blood in the cell sheet vascular network to maintain the viability of all cells, we developed two types of vascular beds; (1) a femoral muscle-based vascular bed, and (2) a synthetic collagen gel-based vascular bed. Both vascular beds successfully provide the critical flow of culture medium, which allows 12-layer cell sheets to survive. Such bioreactor systems, when combined with cell sheet engineering techniques, have produced functional vascularized 3D tissues. Here we explain and discuss the various processes to obtain vascular networks by properly connecting cell sheets and the engineering of 3D tissues.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["KatsuhisaSakaguchi", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.016"}
{"title": "Infantile hemangiomas, retinopathy of prematurity and cancer: a common pathogenetic role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system.", "abstract": "The serendipitous demonstration that the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist propranolol promotes the regression of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) aroused interest around the involvement of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in angiogenic processes. The efficacy of propranolol was related to the \u03b22-AR blockade and the consequent inhibition of the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting the hypothesis that propranolol could also be effective in treating retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a retinal pathology characterized by VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis. Consequent to the encouraging animal studies, a pilot clinical trial showed that oral propranolol protects newborns from ROP progression, even though this treatment is not sufficiently safe. Further, animal studies clarified the role of \u03b23-ARs in the development of ROP and, together with several preclinical studies demonstrating the key role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in tumor progression, vascularization, and metastasis, prompted us to also investigate the participation of \u03b23-ARs in tumor growth. The aim of this review is to gather the recent findings on the role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in IHs, ROP, and cancer, highlighting the fact that these different pathologies, triggered by different pathogenic noxae, share common pathogenic mechanisms characterized by the presence of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, which may be contrasted by targeting the \u03b2-adrenergic system. The mechanisms characterizing the pathogenesis of IHs, ROP, and cancer may also be active during the fetal-neonatal development, and a great contribution to the knowledge on the role of \u03b2-ARs in diseases characterized by chronic hypoxia may come from research focusing on the fetal and neonatal period.", "journal": "Medicinal research reviews", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["LucaFilippi", "MassimoDal Monte", "GiovanniCasini", "MartaDaniotti", "FedericaSereni", "PaolaBagnoli"], "doi": "10.1002/med.21336"}
{"title": "Trg-deficient Salmonella colonize quiescent tumor regions by exclusively penetrating or proliferating.", "abstract": "Chemotherapeutics fail to effectively treat tumors because they cannot reach quiescent regions far from blood vessels. Motile Salmonella are an attractive delivery system that could break this therapeutic barrier. However, little is known about the dissemination and tissue penetration of individual bacteria in tumors after intravenous administration. We hypothesized that eliminating the Trg receptor would improve accumulation in tumor quiescence. To test this hypothesis, we deleted the trg gene from nonpathogenic Salmonella. To quantify individual bacterial behavior, we measured tissue penetration in a tumor-on-a-chip device and measured colony localization in mouse tumors using immunofluorescence. In tumors in vitro and in mice, trg(-) Salmonella penetrated farther into tissue than control bacteria. This difference in localization was caused by the inability to sense sugars in well perfused tissue. Three distinct bacterial phenotypes were observed: proliferating, penetrating, and inactive. Large proliferating colonies, containing more than 40% of individual bacteria, only formed less than 60\u03bcm from blood vessels. Small colonies, in comparison, were present both near (inactive) and far (penetrating) from vessels. The farthest was 361.2\u03bcm from a vessel, demonstrating the ability to target avascular regions. In addition, colonization was most pronounced in poorly vascularized tumor regions. We show that deletion of trg amplifies Salmonella accumulation in quiescent tumor regions, and, for the first time, identify biological processes that control bacterial distribution in tumors. Understanding how Salmonella penetrate tissue, target quiescence and specifically replicate in tumors are essential steps toward creating a tightly controlled, tunable bacterial therapy.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["MiaominZhang", "Neil SForbes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.014"}
{"title": "Dual tumor targeting with pH-sensitive and bioreducible polymer-complexed oncolytic adenovirus.", "abstract": "Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) have shown great promise in cancer gene therapy but their efficacy has been compromised by potent immunological, biochemical, and specific tumor-targeting limitations. To take full advantage of the innate cancer-specific killing potency of oncolytic Ads but also exploit the subtleties of the tumor microenvironment, we have generated a pH-sensitive and bio-reducible polymer (PPCBA)-coated oncolytic Ad. Ad-PPCBA complexes showed higher cellular uptake at pH 6.0 than pH 7.4 in both high and low coxsackie and adenovirus receptor-(CAR)-expressing cells, thereby demonstrating Ad-PPCBA's ability to target the low pH hypoxic tumor microenvironment and overcome CAR dependence for target cell uptake. Endocytic mechanism studies indicated that Ad-PPCBA internalization is mediated by macropinocytosis instead of the CAR-dependent endocytic pathway that internalizes naked Ad. VEGF-specific shRNA-expressing oncolytic Ad complexed with PPCBA (RdB/shVEGF-PPCBA) elicited much more potent suppression of U87 human brain cancer cell VEGF gene expression in vitro, and human breast cancer MCF7 cell/Matrigel plug vascularization in a mouse model, when cancer cells had been previously infected at pH 6.0 versus pH 7.4. Moreover, intratumorally and intravenously injected RdB/shVEGF-PPCBA nanocomplexes elicited significantly higher therapeutic efficacy than naked virus in U87-tumor mouse xenograft models, reducing IL-6, ALT, and AST serum levels. These data demonstrated PPCBA's biocompatibility and capability to shield the Ad surface to prevent innate immune response against Ad after both intratumoral and systemic administration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that smart, tumor-specific, oncolytic Ad-PPCBA complexes can be exploited to treat both primary and metastatic tumors.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["Chang YoonMoon", "Joung-WooChoi", "DayanandaKasala", "Soo-JungJung", "Sung WanKim", "Chae-OkYun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.021"}

The relationship between vascular network architecture and functional hydraulic regulation during actual water flow remains unexplored. Here, we developed a method to visualize individual xylem vessels of the 3D xylem network of Arabidopsis thaliana, and to analyze the functional activities of these vessels using synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with hydrophilic gold nanoparticles as flow tracers. We show how the organization of the xylem network changes dynamically throughout the plant, and reveal how the elementary units of this transport system are organized to ensure both long-distance axial water transport and local lateral water transport. Xylem vessels form distinct clusters that operate as functional units, and the activity of these units, which determines water flow pathways, is modulated not only by varying the number and size of xylem vessels, but also by altering their interconnectivity and spatial arrangement. Based on these findings, we propose a regulatory model of water transport that ensures hydraulic efficiency and safety.", "journal": "Plant & cell physiology", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["JoonghyukPark", "Hae KooKim", "JeongeunRyu", "SungsookAhn", "Sang JoonLee", "IldooHwang"], "doi": "10.1093/pcp/pcu198"}

In the Group 3, the rats had a dorsal skin flap without any surgical intervention. Ten days later, the flaps were harvested for histopathologic examination and biochemical analyses.\nThe rats in the Group 1 had significantly larger necrotic area and lower flap viability than in the Group 2 and 3 (p<0.05).

The MPO activity in the distal of skin flaps was significantly higher in the Group 1 compared to the Group 2 and 3 (p<0.05).\nThis study shows that ovariectomy has deleterious effects on skin flap viability in a rat model (Tab. 1, Fig. 6, Ref. 44).", "journal": "Bratislavske lekarske listy", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["ACoskun", "D CArikan", "Y KCoban", "HSayar", "MKilinc", "DOzbag"], "doi": "10.4149/bll_2014_148"}
{"title": "New fat-derived products for treating skin-induced lesions of scleroderma in nude mice.", "abstract": "Scleroderma is characterized by cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms and face. As of today, there is no treatment for fibrotic skin lesions of scleroderma. Previously we generated and validated a model of scleroderma-like skin sclerosis in nude mice, appropriate to inject human derived products. We showed that the subcutaneous injection of micro-fat (MF), purified and injected using small caliber cannulas, have anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic effects and appears more suitable for the treatment of skin lesions of scleroderma compared to the gold standard (Coleman's technique or macro-fat). Here we compared the long-term efficacy of micro-fat \"enriched\" with other therapeutic products including the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of fat and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from blood in our murine model of scleroderma.\nWe used 72 nude mice in this study. We formed six experimental groups: Macro-fat, MF, SVF, PRP, MF\u2009+\u2009SVF, MF\u2009+\u2009PRP. This project has three phases: i) Induction of skin sclerosis by daily subcutaneous injections of bleomycin (BLM) for 4 weeks in nude mice; ii) Purification and injection of the different cell therapy products; iii) Histological analyses done 8 weeks post-injections.\nMF\u2009+\u2009SVF and MF\u2009+\u2009PRP significantly reversed dermal and epidermal sclerosis (P <0.01). Macro-fat, SVF, PRP only corrected the dermal sclerosis (P <0.05). Epidermal sclerosis was reduced in treatments containing MF (P <0.01). MF was more stable.

{"title": "Swimming-induced exercise promotes hypertrophy and vascularization of fast skeletal muscle fibres and activation of myogenic and angiogenic transcriptional programs in adult zebrafish.", "abstract": "The adult skeletal muscle is a plastic tissue with a remarkable ability to adapt to different levels of activity by altering its excitability, its contractile and metabolic phenotype and its mass. We previously reported on the potential of adult zebrafish as a tractable experimental model for exercise physiology, established its optimal swimming speed and showed that swimming-induced contractile activity potentiated somatic growth. Given that the underlying exercise-induced transcriptional mechanisms regulating muscle mass in vertebrates are not fully understood, here we investigated the cellular and molecular adaptive mechanisms taking place in fast skeletal muscle of adult zebrafish in response to swimming.\nFish were trained at low swimming speed (0.1 m/s; non-exercised) or at their optimal swimming speed (0.4 m/s; exercised). A significant increase in fibre cross-sectional area (1.290\u00b188 vs. 1.665\u00b1106 \u03bcm2) and vascularization (298\u00b123 vs. 458\u00b138 capillaries/mm2) was found in exercised over non-exercised fish. Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis evidenced the activation of a series of complex transcriptional networks of extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules and pathways involved in the regulation of muscle mass (e.g. IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR, BMP, MSTN), myogenesis and satellite cell activation (e.g. PAX3, FGF, Notch, Wnt, MEF2, Hh, EphrinB2) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF, HIF, Notch, EphrinB2, KLF2), some of which had not been previously associated with exercise-induced contractile activity.\nThe results from the present study show that exercise-induced contractile activity in adult zebrafish promotes a coordinated adaptive response in fast muscle that leads to increased muscle mass by hypertrophy and increased vascularization by angiogenesis. We propose that these phenotypic adaptations are the result of extensive transcriptional changes induced by exercise. Analysis of the transcriptional networks that are activated in response to exercise in the adult zebrafish fast muscle resulted in the identification of key signaling pathways and factors for the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, myogenesis and angiogenesis that have been remarkably conserved during evolution from fish to mammals. These results further support the validity of the adult zebrafish as an exercise model to decipher the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms governing skeletal muscle mass and function in vertebrates.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2014-12-19", "authors": ["Arjan PPalstra", "MireiaRovira", "DavidRizo-Roca", "Joan RamonTorrella", "Herman PSpaink", "Josep VPlanas"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-1136\n10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00161.x\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.012\n10.1038/nrm3118\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.12.020\n10.1249/mss.0b013e3180616b27\n10.2337/dc10-9990\n10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00905.x\n10.1016/j.mod.2013.06.001\n10.1111/febs.12412\n10.1242/dmm.010082\n10.1085/jgp.200809982\n10.1016/B978-0-12-374814-0.00015-X\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001679\n10.1242/jeb.029918\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014483\n10.1111/febs.12253\n10.1073/pnas.1000300107\n10.1242/jeb.038620\n10.1017/S0007114511003709\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.08.005\n10.1152/physiol.00041.2007\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00400-3\n10.1083/jcb.201006098\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.116715\n10.1210/me.2010-0127\n10.1038/387083a0\n10.1242/jeb.00635\n10.1152/ajpcell.00105.2009\n10.1038/ng.2772\n10.1083/jcb.201211134\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.021\n10.1242/dev.068858\n10.1096/fj.09-131870\n10.1073/pnas.1206410109\n10.1152/japplphysiol.01215.2007\n10.1186/1471-2164-14-173\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00167.2012\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00634.2010\n10.1016/j.stem.2007.10.006\n10.1242/jeb.102210\n10.1002/mus.21972\n10.1111/febs.12372\n10.1242/dev.008367\n10.1093/emboj/20.22.6414\n10.1016/0925-4773(96)00601-6\n10.1242/dev.007088\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.12.001\n10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00373-2\n10.1007/s00424-008-0563-9\n10.1007/s00360-010-0516-4\n10.1152/ajpregu.00110.2003\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.1992.tb02611.x\n10.1002/jez.1402370203\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00035.2004\n10.1038/nrm2183\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.039\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-092910-154002\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006684\n10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.046\n10.1126/science.1178577\n10.1038/nature08889\n10.1111/micc.12117\n10.1152/ajpendo.00581.2007\n10.1038/nature06613\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00250.2010\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.119032\n10.1007/s00360-009-0398-5\n10.1152/ajpregu.00116.2006\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1003389\n10.1177/5.4.420\n10.1177/41.2.7678272\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262"}
{"title": "[New opportunities, MRI biomarkers in the evaluation of head and neck cancer].", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed rapidly during the past few years and, according to the needs of therapy, has opened new perspectives in oncologic imaging with better and better realization of the latest technological advances. After the introduction of \"organ preservation\" protocols the role of imaging has become more important. New therapeutic methods (improvement in radiation therapy and chemotherapy) need better tumor characterization and prognostic information along with the most accurate anatomical information. Multiparametric anatomical and functional MR imaging (MM-MRI) using high magnetic field strength (3 Tesla) are useful in determining tumor-specific MRI biomarkers and in evaluating the changes in these parameters during therapy to provide early assessment of the therapeutic response. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) provides information at the cellular level about cell density and the integrity of the plasma membrane. DW-MRI shows potential in improving the detection of cancer due to its high specificity and high negative predictive value. Quantification is performed using an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the values are independent of the magnetic field strength. In the latest publications the accuracy of DW-MRI has been reported around 90% for the differentiation between malignant versus benign tumor using an ADC cut-off mean value of 0.700-1.200 10(-3) mm(2)/s units, but no common threshold ADC value exists in clinical routine for the differentiation of malignant and benign tissues. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), as a marker of angiogenesis, provides information about vascularization at the tissue level. Angiogenetic alterations cause changes in the parameters of vascular physiology (perfusion, blood volume, capillary permeability) and thus alter the contrast enhancement observed on contrast MRI. High-grade and/or advanced stage tumors are associated with increased blood volume, increased permeability and increased perfusion; the data can be evaluated using semiquantitative or quantitative methods. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) provides biochemical analysis at the molecular level. The results are promising, although further studies are required to determine whether MRSI can be used to identify or exclude cancer within regions where the cancer is not evident on conventional MRI or with the other functional imaging methods. Some of the studies demonstrated the usefulness of these functional MRI methods also in the head and neck region to differentiate benign from malignant tumors, to quantify the response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, to identify residual or recurrent tumor and to correlate the perfusion or diffusion data with prognosis. There are still some overlaps between benign and malignant changes, and the use of these functional MR measurements in routine diagnostics are still not fully validated today. Functional MR measurements are useful parts of the high quality multiparametric MRI, they offer important supportive biological and molecular information with the aid of high resolution morphological imaging.\nA m\u00e1gneses rezonancia k\u00e9palkot\u00e1s (MRI) ut\u00f3bbi \u00e9vekben tapasztalhat\u00f3 gyors fejl\u00f5d\u00e9se egyr\u00e9szt a ter\u00e1pia ig\u00e9nye szerint, m\u00e1sr\u00e9szt a technikai lehet\u00f5s\u00e9gek alapj\u00e1n \u00faj perspekt\u00edv\u00e1t nyitott az onkol\u00f3giai k\u00e9palkot\u00e1sban.

{"title": "A Prospective Evaluation of Lymphedema-Specific Quality-of-Life Outcomes Following Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer.", "abstract": "Microsurgical techniques for the treatment of lymphedema rapidly increased in popularity. Although surgical success with vascularized lymph node (VLN) transfer has been demonstrated, limited studies have investigated the influence of microsurgical treatments on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) parameters. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate changes in HRQoL following VLN transfer for upper- and lower-extremity lymphedema using a validated instrument.\nAn Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study was performed of patients who underwent VLN transfer for symptomatic upper- or lower-limb lymphedema. A validated lymphedema-specific questionnaire-lymphoedema quality-of-life study-was utilized to assess specific quality-of-life parameters at multiple time points during the 12-month perioperative period. For a comparison with HRQoL metrics, limb circumference measurements were obtained to assess circumference differentiation.\nTwenty-five patients met the study criteria. Limb circumference analysis revealed significant early improvements following VLN transfer, with continued improvement during the study period (upper-limb lymphedema: 24.4 %; lower-limb lymphedema: 35.2 %). These improvements were mirrored by improvements in all HRQoL domains and overall quality of life (p < 0.01). The function, body appearance, symptom, and mood domains were all found to be significantly improved during the postoperative evaluation, with continued improvement being reported throughout the study period (p < 0.01 within each domain).\nMicrosurgical treatment of lymphedema with VLN transfer procedures effectively decrease limb circumference. This improvement is mirrored by improvements in patient-reported outcomes and quality of life. These changes can be observed as soon as 1 month postoperatively, and continued steady improvement can be expected.", "journal": "Annals of surgical oncology", "date": "2014-12-18", "authors": ["Ketan MPatel", "Chia-YuLin", "Ming-HueiCheng"], "doi": "10.1245/s10434-014-4276-3"}

The virus encodes a constitutively active chemokine receptor homologue, vGPCR that possesses potent angiogenic and tumorigenic properties, and is critical for KSHV pathobiology. To date, a number of signaling pathways have been identified as key in mediating vGPCR oncogenic potential.\nIn this study, we identify a novel pathway, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which is dysregulated by vGPCR expression in endothelial cells. Expression of vGPCR in endothelial cells enhances the nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, that correlates with an increase in \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity. Activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling by vGPCR is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway, as treatment of vGPCR-expressing cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, leads to a decreased activation of a \u03b2-catenin-driven reporter, a significant decrease in expression of \u03b2-catenin target genes, and reduced endothelial tube formation.\nGiven the critical role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, the findings from this study suggest a novel mechanism in KSHV-induced malignancies.", "journal": "Virology journal", "date": "2014-12-18", "authors": ["MagdalenaAngelova", "MaryBethFerris", "Kenneth FSwan", "Harris EMcFerrin", "GabriellaPridjian", "Cindy AMorris", "Deborah ESullivan"], "doi": "10.1186/s12985-014-0218-8\n10.1016/0140-6736(90)90001-L\n10.1097/00002030-199910220-00014\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.1.110304.100133\n10.1096/fj.03-1035hyp\n10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00237-4\n10.1038/34193\n10.1073/pnas.1001065107\n10.1016/j.tips.2005.06.004\n10.1385/CBB:40:3:305\n10.1186/1743-422X-4-87\n10.1126/science.1116221\n10.1002/1521-1878(200011)22:11<961::AID-BIES1>3.0.CO;2-T\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65278-9\n10.1038/73448\n10.1038/onc.2012.484\n10.1128/JVI.77.22.12276-12284.2003\n10.1016/S0955-0674(03)00008-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.040337\n10.1093/carcin/bgr020\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.012\n10.1097/00129039-200403000-00005\n10.1634/theoncologist.5-suppl_1-28\n10.1128/JVI.00016-07\n10.1074/jbc.274.47.33539\n10.1126/science.1060100\n10.4161/cc.5.20.3357\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.05.005\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0878\n10.1074/jbc.M611871200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000156273.30274.f7"}

The porcine reticular layer dermis in 2 groups were treated with decellularization (P-ADM), then the P-ADM in group B were treated with processing by MMP-7 (P-ADM-pm). Thirty adult male Wistar rats were selected. P-ADM (group A) and P-ADM-pm (group B) were subcutaneously transplanted into the left and right fascia lacuna, respectively. The implants were harvested from 6 rats at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after implantation, respectively. Gross, histochemical, and immunohistochemical observations, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination were performed to observe host cells, microvessels infiltration and histological changes in the implants.\nNo rat died in the experiment, incision healed well and no obvious inflammatory reaction was seen in all rats. Gross observation suggested that the implants of 2 groups were encapsulated by a thin layer of connective tissue at 7 days after implantation. With the time of implantation, the microvessels increased and coarsened, and the changes of group B were more obvious than those of group A. At 21 days, the microvessels of 2 groups decreased, and the implants of group B showed complete vascularization. The histochemical and immunohistochemical observations showed that group A had more severe inflammatory response than group B. Fibroblasts and microvessels in group B appeared in the superficial zone of implant at 3 and 7 days after implantation and they could be observed in the center zone of implant at 14 and21 days. However, fibroblasts and microvessels in group A appeared in the superficial zone of implant at 3 and 14 days and they could not be observed in the center zone of implant at 28 days. Fibroblasts and microvessels of group B were significantly more than those of group A (P < 0.05). SEM examination showed that more fibroblasts and new collagen fibrils were observed in group B at 14 days.\nThe host response to P-ADM-pm is similar to normal wound healing, and P-ADM-pm as implantable scaffold material plays a good template conduction role.", "journal": "Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["FangWang", "YanWu", "WenShi", "YangShao", "YindongMa", "JunJia", "NaijunXin", "QiuheWu", "GuodongSong"], "doi": null}

Prefabricated cutting guides facilitated precise shaping of the vascularized bone accounting for location of perforators.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in pituitary adenomas: human studies and new mutant mouse models.", "abstract": "The role of angiogenesis in pituitary tumor development has been questioned, as pituitary tumors have been usually found to be less vascularized than the normal pituitary tissue. Nevertheless, a significantly higher degree of vasculature has been shown in invasive or macropituitary prolactinomas when compared to noninvasive and microprolactinomas. Many growth factors and their receptors are involved in pituitary tumor development. For example, VEGF, FGF-2, FGFR1, and PTTG, which give a particular vascular phenotype, are modified in human and experimental pituitary adenomas of different histotypes. In particular, vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, the central mediator of angiogenesis in endocrine glands, was encountered in experimental and human pituitary tumors at different levels of expression and, in particular, was higher in dopamine agonist resistant prolactinomas. Furthermore, several anti-VEGF techniques lowered tumor burden in human and experimental pituitary adenomas. Therefore, even though the role of angiogenesis in pituitary adenomas is contentious, VEGF, making permeable pituitary endothelia, might contribute to adequate temporal vascular supply and mechanisms other than endothelial cell proliferation.

Here we show, by using time-lapse imaging of zebrafish fin regeneration and genetic lineage tracing of endothelial cells in the mouse retina, that vein-derived endothelial tip cells contribute to emerging arteries. Our movies uncover that arterial-fated tip cells change migration direction and migrate backwards within the expanding vascular plexus. This behaviour critically depends on chemokine receptor cxcr4a function. We show that the relevant Cxcr4a ligand Cxcl12a selectively accumulates in newly forming bone tissue even when ubiquitously overexpressed, pointing towards a tissue-intrinsic mode of chemokine gradient formation. Furthermore, we find that cxcr4a mutant cells can contribute to developing arteries when in association with wild-type cells, suggesting collective migration of endothelial cells. Together, our findings reveal specific cell migratory behaviours in the developing blood vessel plexus and uncover a conserved mode of artery formation.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["CongXu", "Sana SHasan", "IngaSchmidt", "Susana FRocha", "Mara EPitulescu", "JeroenBussmann", "DanaMeyen", "ErezRaz", "Ralf HAdams", "Arndt FSiekmann"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms6758"}

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) combined with synchrotron X-ray imaging technique is a new promising tool for investigating plant hydraulics in opaque xylem vessels of vascular plants. However, in practical applications of AuNPs for real-time quantitative visualization of sap flows, their interaction with a vascular network needs to be verified in advance. In this study, the effect of AuNPs on the water-refilling function of xylem vessels is experimentally investigated with three monocot species. Discrepancy in the water uptakes starts to appear at about 20 min to 40 min after the supply of AuNP solution to the test plant by the possible gradual accumulation of AuNPs on the internal structures of vasculature. However conclusively, it is observed that the water-refilling speeds in individual xylem vessels are virtually unaffected by hydrophilically surface-modified AuNPs (diameter \u223c20 nm). Therefore, the AuNPs can be effectively used as flow tracers in the xylem vessels in the first 20\u223c30 min without any physiological barrier.

Besides, florid vascularization and aberrantly elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) occur very often. The present study was designed to examine the inhibitory effect of AKT3, PI3KCA, and VEGFR2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) on GBM cell invasiveness. T98G cells were transfected with AKT3, PI3KCA, and/or VEGFR2 siRNAs. VEGFR2 protein-positive cells were identified by flow cytometry using specific monoclonal anti-VEGFR2 antibodies. Alterations in messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-13, MMP-14), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (TIMP-1, TIMP-3), c-Fos, c-Jun, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), ObRa, and cathepsin D genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR.

Recently described mechanisms for pVHL modulation shed light on the open question of the HIF/pVHL pathway regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which RSUME stabilizes HIFs, by studying RSUME effect on pVHL function and to determine the role of RSUME on pVHL-related tumor progression. We determined that RSUME sumoylates and physically interacts with pVHL and negatively regulates the assembly of the complex between pVHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV), inhibiting HIF-1 and 2\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. We found that RSUME is expressed in human VHL tumors (renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastoma) and by overexpressing or silencing RSUME in a pVHL-HIF-oxygen-dependent degradation stability reporter assay, we determined that RSUME is necessary for the loss of function of type 2 pVHL mutants. The functional RSUME/pVHL interaction in VHL-related tumor progression was further confirmed using a xenograft assay in nude mice. RCC clones, in which RSUME was knocked down and express either pVHL wt or type 2 mutation, have an impaired tumor growth, as well as HIF-2\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor A and tumor vascularization diminution.

Small follicles (3-5mm in diameter) from ovaries obtained in the slaughterhouse were selected according to their vascularization and follicular fluid color in order to isolate GC. Granulosa cells were plated at a density of 5\u00d710(4)cells/well in supplemented alpha-MEM containing 3 levels (0, 10(-8)M and 10(-7)M) of Ang II, ANP, and EDN1 for up to 96h.

The results showed that Ang II, ANP, and EDN1 modulate the steroidogenic output and proliferation index of GCs depending on the dose and time of culture. The selected vasoactive peptides increased androstenedione (A4) consumption in parallel with increased estradiol (E2).

During the dry season they aestivate on land, with the collapse of secondary lamellae of their gills and the establishment of an exclusive aerial ventilation through the vascularization and expansion of their lungs. To date, the mechanisms underlining the respiratory organ remodeling in aestivating lungfishes are unknown. This study aimed to identify key switch components of the stress-induced signal transduction networks implicated in both rapid and medium-long term remodeling of the gills and lungs of the African lungfish Protopterus annectens during aestivation. Through immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting, the localization and the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Akt, Hsp-90 and HIF-1\u03b1 were evaluated in both gills and lungs exposed to three experimental conditions: freshwater (FW), 6 months of experimentally induced aestivation (6mAe), and 6 days after arousal from 6 months of aestivation (6mAe6d). After 6mAe, the expression of NOS (p-eNOS antibody), Akt (p-Akt antibody), and Hsp-90 decreased in the gills, while NOS and Hsp-90 expression increased with Akt remained unchanged in the lungs. Upon 6mAe6d, NOS, Akt and Hsp-90 expression in the gills returned to the respective FW values. In the lungs of the aroused fish, NOS and Akt decreased to their respective FW levels, while Hsp-90 expression was enhanced with respect to aestivation. In both respiratory organs, the qualitative and quantitative patterns of HIF-1\u03b1 expression correlated inversely to those of NOS.

{"title": "Antiangiogenic effects of a novel synthetic curcumin analogue in pancreatic cancer.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and NF-\u03baB play essential roles in cancer cell growth and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) serves as a regulator of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB protein. We hypothesized that curcumin and its analogues EF31 and UBS109 would disrupt angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer (PC) through modulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB. Conditioned medium from MIA PaCa-2 or PANC-1 cells exposed to curcumin and its analogues in vitro significantly impaired angiogenesis in an egg CAM assay and blocked HUVEC tube assembly in comparison to untreated cell medium. In vivo, EF31 and UBS109 blocked the vascularization of subcutaneous matrigel plugs developed by MIA PaCa-2 in mice. Significant inhibition of VEGF, angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, platelet derived growth factor, COX-2, and TGF\u03b2 secretion was observed in PC cell lines treated with UBS109, EF31 or curcumin. Treatment with UBS109, EF31 or curcumin inhibited HSP90, NF-\u03baB, and HIF-1\u03b1 transcription in PC cell lines. UBS109 and EF31 inhibited HSP90 and HIF-1\u03b1 expression even when elevated due to NF-\u03baB (p65) overexpression. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin analogues EF31 and UBS109 induce the downregulation of HIF-1\u03b1, Hsp90, COX-2 and VEGF in tumor samples from xenograft models compared to untreated xenografts.

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells from peripheral blood support bone regeneration by provoking an angiogenic response.", "abstract": "Neovascularization is crucial for fracture healing and plays an important role in long-time graft survival in tissue engineering applications. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be isolated from peripheral blood avoiding donor site morbidity, which makes them attractive for autologous cell-based engineering of neovessels. However, contradictory results are published concerning the vasculogenic potential of this cell type. We could previously show that implanted human endothelial vein cells (HUVECs) gave rise to the formation of a complex functional human neovasculature in a heterotopic (subcutaneous) as well as in an orthotopic (calvarial defect) model of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, where vessel formation could even be increased by coimplanting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) functioning as perivascular cells. In this study, we investigated whether coimplantation of MSCs which have been predifferentiated in vitro into SMCs (SMC-MSCs) may enable pbEPCs to form blood vessels upon implantation and, if this would be the case, whether the resulting enhanced vascularization may support bone regeneration. For this purpose, pbEPCs and SMC-MSCs were mono- or cocultured in collagen matrices and seeded into scaffolds consisting of decalcified processed bovine cancellous bone (PBCB, Tutobone). Neovascularization and osteogenesis were evaluated using a calvarial bone defect-model in SCID mice. Our experiments could show that the missing vasculogenic potential of pbEPCs is not rescued by coimplantation of SMCs derived from MSCs predifferentiated along the vascular smooth muscle lineage. However, implantation of both cell types alone, or in combination induced an angiogenic response, which correlated in a positive manner with bone formation within the implants.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["Sebastian MGoerke", "JuliaObermeyer", "JuliaPlaha", "G Bj\u00f6rnStark", "G\u00fcnterFinkenzeller"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2014.12.001"}

While treatment has traditionally focused on attempts at radical resection, a lack of consensus among surgeons has hindered the establishment of a well-defined algorithm to guide the management of these highly co-morbid peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We present the case of an advanced plexiform neurofibroma of the right foot in a 24-year-old male with neurofibromatosis type 1. The patient presented following accelerated tumor growth with extensive osseous erosion, intractable pain, and progressive ankle instability that limited his capacity to ambulate and wear shoes. A modified transtibial amputation with a vascularized fibular bone graft (Ertl procedure) was performed without complication. Following graduated rehabilitation, postoperatively, the patient regained functional independence and was able to ambulate without pain in a customized prosthesis after 3 months.

These publications have been combined with our own experience repairing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and encephaloceles that developed spontaneously, traumatically, or intentionally as a result of endoscopic skull-base surgery.\nWe present a systematic methodology for the repair of these defects. We have divided our surgical approach into four separate corridors. These are the transnasal, transsphenoidal, transethmoidal, and transmaxillary corridors. Dissection strategies vary for each corridor, but with a combination of approaches, all areas of the anterior skull base can be accessed. Skull-base defects are successfully repaired with a multilayered closure that often involves use of a vascularized pedicled mucosal flap. Adoption of this technique has decreased our rate of postoperative CSF leak from 5.9%-3.1%.\nEndoscopic endonasal repair of CSF leaks and encephaloceles has evolved significantly during the past decade. The versatility of different endoscopic approaches through the four endonasal corridors allows for the endoscopic repair of almost all skull-base defects.

{"title": "Endoscopic approaches to the craniovertebral junction and odontoid process.", "abstract": "The microsurgical transoral approach has traditionally been the preferred access for ventral decompression of the craniovertebral junction. This natural corridor, although direct, may be a challenging approach because of potential morbidities. The evolution of endoscopic methods in skull base surgeries has reduced morbidity and improved results. Endoscopic approaches are also being used for ventral decompression at the craniovertebral junction. Some technical modifications in this approach are described.\nAn endoscope is inserted endonasally for a panoramic view of the entire area of interest, from the sphenoid to second cervical vertebra. Image guidance systems are used in all cases to guide the resection. The soft palate is retracted away with a rubber catheter sling when both nasal and oral corridors are being used. Various mucosal flaps are raised for access and reconstruction. Actual decompression can be done through the nasal or oral corridors based on the relationship of the pathology to the palate. Reconstruction is done using standard principles with the vascularized flaps, fat, and fibrin glue.\nReduced surgical morbidity by avoiding palatal split and good postoperative healing are some of the advantages of this modified endoscopic technique. Better surgical exposure and a wide perspective facilitate the decompression.

The aim of this work is to understand this material-driven vascularization by investigating the effect of polymer MAA-content, in the absence of surface roughness, on the behaviour of macrophage-like and endothelial cells. Smooth polymer films containing 20, 30 or 40% MAA or methyl methacrylate as a control copolymerized with isodecyl acrylate, were synthesized to study the effect of MAA content in smooth films, without roughness. Macrophage-like cells (dTHP1) incubated on 40% MAA films for 96 hours increased the expression of the angiogenic genes HIF1\u03b1 and SDF1\u03b1, and of the inflammatory genes IL1\u03b2, IL6 and TNF\u03b1, while decreasing the expression of osteopontin. Endothelial cells (HUVEC) on 40% MAA films for 96 hours increased the expression of the angiogenic genes MMP9 and CXCR4, and of osteopontin. In dTHP1 cells, principal component analysis established a positive correlation between MAA polymer content, HIF1\u03b1 expression and the expression of IL6, IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, suggesting that HIF1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB pathway may be involved. It was found that MAA chemistry, without topographical differences, promoted changes in gene expression in macrophage-like and endothelial cells. This effect was more significant above a threshold between 30 to 40% MAA. The amount of MAA in the copolymer likely promoted the cell responses, future work will study the effects of varying MAA content.

During examination of synovial membranes in the first test group the patches of thickened regenerating inner layer (intima) made up by large proliferating synoviocytes were observed. The layer of loose connective tissue (subintima) contained a large number of small blood vessels and was only slightly infiltrated by inflammatory cells. The morphological examination of synovial membranes in the second test group discovered thickened regenerating intimal layer sitting on hypertrophied subintima with dense vascular network. Elastic collagenous layers of synovial membrane adjoined proliferating elements in cartilage plates.\nBoth autologous MNC fraction and MMSC from bone marrow proved effectiveness in the treatment of destructive inflammatory joint diseases which stimulate neoangiogenesis.

Endothelialization was confirmed to be effective by Giemsa staining. Histological evaluation of specimens in Hematoxylin/Eosin staining showed significant decrease (p<0.05) of inflammatory reaction (confirmed by CD-68-positive cell staining) after decellularization. All specimens showed strongest inflammatory reactions at areas of destroyed extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts could be detected in all specimens, with strongest infiltration in decellularized specimens (p<0.05).

NB granules were well integrated in the peri-implant tissue and were surrounded by newly formed bone tissue. Multinucleated giant cells were visible on the surfaces of the remaining granules.

Perfused capillary network can be a solution for this issue; however, construction of a complete capillary network at single cell level using the existing technology is nearly impossible due to limitations in time and spatial resolution of the dispensing technology. To address the vascularization issue, we developed a 3D printing method to construct larger (lumen size of ~1mm) fluidic vascular channels and to create adjacent capillary network through a natural maturation process, thus providing a feasible solution to connect the capillary network to the large perfused vascular channels. In our model, microvascular bed was formed in between two large fluidic vessels, and then connected to the vessels by angiogenic sprouting from the large channel edge. Our bio-printing technology has a great potential in engineering vascularized thick tissues and vascular niches, as the vascular channels are simultaneously created while cells and matrices are printed around the channels in desired 3D patterns.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular bioengineering", "date": "2014-12-09", "authors": ["Vivian KLee", "Alison MLanzi", "NgoHaygan", "Seung-SchikYoo", "Peter AVincent", "GuohaoDai"], "doi": "10.1007/s12195-014-0340-0"}

The major question discussed in this review is whether a manipulation that has anti-aging properties can alter the onset and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which age is the major risk factor. Rapamycin has been shown to prevent (and possibly restore in some cases) the deficit in memory observed in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD-Tg) as well as reduce A\u03b2 and tau aggregation, restore cerebral blood flow and vascularization, and reduce microglia activation. All of these parameters are widely recognized as symptoms central to the development of AD. Furthermore, rapamycin has also been shown to improve memory and reduce anxiety and depression in several other mouse models that show cognitive deficits as well as in 'normal' mice.

{"title": "Successful orthotopic transplantation of short tracheal segments without immunosuppressive therapy.", "abstract": "Results of tracheal transplantation have been disappointing due to of ischaemia and rejection. It has been experimentally demonstrated that results of tracheal autograft/allograft transplantation were correlated with both graft length and revascularization method. Recently, we demonstrated that heterotopic epithelium-denuded-cryopreserved tracheal allograft (TA) displayed satisfactory immune tolerance. We aimed at evaluating the results of such allografts in orthotopic transplantation according to graft length and prior heterotopic or single-stage orthotopic revascularization in a rabbit model.\nTwenty New Zealand rabbits were used. Six females served as donors. Tracheal mucosa was mechanically peeled off and then the TAs were cryopreserved. Male recipients were divided into three groups receiving: (i) long TA segment with prior heterotopic revascularization (10-12 tracheal rings, n = 3); (ii) average TA segment with single-stage orthotopic revascularization (6-8 tracheal rings, n = 4); (iii) short TA segment with single-stage orthotopic revascularization (4-5 tracheal rings, n = 7). No immunosuppressive therapy was administered. Grafts were assessed bronchoscopically and upon death or sacrifice by macroscopic evaluation, histology and immunohistochemical staining for apoptosis.\nFour animals were sacrificed from Day 33 to Day 220. The survival time of other recipients was 0-47 days (mean 19.6 \u00b1 16.7 days). Aside from three animals that died from complications, all TA segments had satisfactory stiffness, were well vascularized, showed varying levels of neoangiogenesis and inflammatory infiltration devoid of lymphocytes, and showed evidence of only low levels of apoptosis. Varying degrees of fibroblastic proliferation originating from the lamina propria were observed in the lumen of all TAs and evolved over time into collagenized fibrosis in animals surviving over 45 days. Likewise, cartilage tracheal rings exhibited central calcification deposits, which started on Day 16 and increased over time. Epithelial regeneration was constantly observed. Intense fibroblastic proliferation led to stenosis in all animals from Groups (i) and (ii) but only one of seven animals from Group (iii).\nOur results suggest that short segments of epithelium-denuded-cryopreserved TA may be reliable for tracheal transplantation in the rabbit model without problems related to graft stiffness or immune rejection.

{"title": "[Systemic treatments of inflammatory breast cancer: an overview].", "abstract": "The poor prognosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is due to its strong metastatic potential. During the last three decades, the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT), and its improvement with successive additions of anthracyclines and then taxanes, allowed to double the survival. However, the 5-year survival still remains lower than 50%, with the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant CT being a major prognostic factor. Since 1995, several innovative approaches have been evaluated. Initially, the trials of high-dose CT with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have generated promising results, but ultimately failed to change standards of treatment, in particular because of its toxicity. More recently, a few targeted therapies, combined to conventional CT, have been assessed, due to the frequent overexpression of HER2 and EGFR and the important vascularization of IBC. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has shown a clear advantage in terms of pCR and survival in studies dedicated to, HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancers, including IBC. Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor anti-HER2 and EGFR, has shown significant activity in two phase II studies dedicated to HER2-positive IBC. The interest of HER2-double blockade by the combination of trastuzumab-pertuzumab combined to docetaxel has been demonstrated in term of pCR in the NEOSPHERE study which also included HER2-positive IBC. Among the anti-angiogenic drugs tested in studies dedicated to IBC, bevacizumab has given the most interesting results in term of efficacy/toxicity ratio. In the Beverly 2 study HER2-positive IBC patients were treated by the combination chemotherapy, trastuzumab and bevacizumab: the rate of pCR was 64%, and the 3-year disease-free and overall survivals were 68% and 90%, respectively; the increase of endothelial cells circulating was inversely correlated to the probability of pCR.

As one of the most frequently used herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine formulas that are prescribed for the regulation of bone and mineral metabolism, the therapeutic effects of Achyranthes bidentata on steroid-induced ONFH remain unclear. Thus, the aim of the current study was to verify whether Achyranthes bidentata extract (ABE) can be used to prevent steroid-induced ONFH and to investigate its underlying pharmacological mechanisms.\nSteroid-induced ONFH rat models were established to evaluate the effects of ABE treatment on osteonecrotic changes and repair processes. Microfocal computed tomography (Micro-CT) was performed to assess the effects of ABE treatment on bone mass, microstructure, and vascularization. Then, the effects of ABE treatment on osteoclast differentiation and bone formation were also evaluated in vivo and in vitro. In addition, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in sera, femoral heads and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were detected at both protein and mRNA levels.\nThe ratio of empty lacuna, adipose tissue area, and adipocyte perimeter in the bone marrow were markedly lower in the ABE treatment groups than in the model group. Micro-CT evaluation indicated that ABE treatment could improve the microstructure of the trabecular bone, increase bone mineral density and promote vascularization in steroid-induced ONFH rats. Moreover, ABE treatment inhibited osteoclast differentiation and activated bone formation markers. Interestingly, OPG downregulation, RANK and RANKL upregulation, and an increased ratio of RANKL to OPG in sera and necrotic femoral head could be reversed by ABE treatment, which also effectively inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and regulated RANKL and OPG expression of in vitro.\nABE may prevent steroid-induced ONFH and alleviate steroid-induced bone deterioration by regulating the RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2014-12-05", "authors": ["YiniJiang", "YanqiongZhang", "WeihengChen", "ChunfangLiu", "XiaominLi", "DanniSun", "ZhenliLiu", "YingXu", "XiaMao", "QiuyanGuo", "NaLin"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-014-0334-7\n10.1007/s00264-012-1612-8\n10.1016/j.mehy.2011.04.036\n10.1007/s00776-010-1516-7\n10.1016/j.autrev.2010.06.007\n10.1016/j.aca.2007.05.016\n10.1080/08923970802439795\n10.1007/BF02973875\n10.1055/s-2005-871275\n10.1002/jcb.20071\n10.1677/JOE-08-0552\n10.1007/s00223-010-9385-9\n10.1002/art.1780401119\n10.3727/096368910X522234\n10.1016/j.jbspin.2009.04.002\n10.1016/j.bcp.2006.08.027\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.02.007\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.05.034\n10.1016/j.jep.2009.11.016\n10.1126/science.289.5484.1504\n10.1016/8756-3282(85)90218-2\n10.3109/07853899309147298\n10.1016/j.mehy.2008.03.021\n10.1590/S0100-879X2005000200004\n10.1177/1759720X12438080\n10.1016/j.bone.2011.03.684\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81569-X\n10.1359/jbmr.2000.15.11.2178"}

Here we examine the development and consequences of vascularization of the tuberculous granuloma in the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, which is characterized by organized granulomas with necrotic cores that bear striking resemblance to those of human tuberculosis. Using intravital microscopy in the transparent larval zebrafish, we show that granuloma formation is intimately associated with angiogenesis. The initiation of angiogenesis in turn coincides with the generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical pro-angiogenic molecule Vegfaa. Pharmacological inhibition of the Vegf pathway suppresses granuloma-associated angiogenesis, reduces infection burden and limits dissemination. Moreover, anti-angiogenic therapies synergize with the first-line anti-tubercular antibiotic rifampicin, as well as with the antibiotic metronidazole, which targets hypoxic bacterial populations. Our data indicate that mycobacteria induce granuloma-associated angiogenesis, which promotes mycobacterial growth and increases spread of infection to new tissue sites.

The Integra Dermal Regeneration Template (IDRT) is the leading synthetic skin substitute because it allows for wound bed regeneration and wound healing.

It is shown here that by incorporating the human elastic protein tropoelastin into a dermal regeneration template (TDRT) we can promote angiogenesis in wound healing. In small and large animal models comprising mice and pigs, the hybrid TDRT biomaterial and IDRT show similar contraction to autografts and decrease wound contraction compared to open wounds. In mice, TDRT accelerates early stage angiogenesis by 2 weeks, as evidenced by increased angiogenesis fluorescent radiant efficiency in live animal imaging and the expression of endothelial cell adhesion marker CD146. In the pig, a full thickness wound repair model confirms increased numbers of blood vessels in the regenerating areas of the dermis closest to the hypodermis and immediately below the epidermis at 2 weeks post-surgery.

Many studies have tried to induce nephron progenitors from pluripotent stem cells by mimicking the developmental processes in vivo. However, the current developmental model does not precisely address the spatiotemporal origin of nephron progenitors, hampering our understanding of cell fate decisions in the kidney. Here, we present a revised model of early-stage kidney specification, suggesting distinct origins of the two major kidney components: the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme. This model enables the induction of metanephric nephron progenitors from both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. The induced cells self-organize in the presence of Wnt signaling and reconstitute 3D nephron structures including both nephric tubules with a clear lumina and glomeruli with podocytes. The engrafted kidney tissue develops vascularized glomeruli and nephric tubules, but it does not produce urine, suggesting the requirement for further maturation. Nevertheless, the generation of nephron components from human-induced pluripotent stem cells will be useful for future application in regenerative therapy and modeling of congenital kidney diseases in vitro.

In VLNT, the most popular lymph node flap donor site is the inguinal region; however, concerns about the possibility of iatrogenic lymphedema hamper the widespread adoption of VLNT. A better understanding of the anatomy of the lymphatic system in the inguinal region is essential to preserving lymph drainage in the leg and avoiding iatrogenic lymphedema.\nFive human cadaver hind-quarter specimens were used for this study. First, the specimens were scanned with indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography to map the lymphatic vessels. A dual injection technique using different radiocontrast media was then applied to delineate arteries and lymphatic vessels on radiographs. Finally, radiological analysis and meticulous dissection were used to investigate relationships between the arteries and lymphatic vessels.\nBy chasing the lymphatic vessels retrogradely from their corresponding lymph nodes, we were able to divide the superficial inguinal lymph nodes into three subgroups: the abdominal, medial thigh, and lateral thigh nodes. We found no connections between the superficial and deep lymphatic system in the inguinal region. The dominant lymph nodes draining the leg were in the lower part of the inguinal triangle, and their efferent lymphatic vessels ran medial to the common femoral artery.\nPreserving the sentinel nodes of the lower leg in the medial thigh and their efferent lymphatic vessels is crucial to avoid iatrogenic lymphedema in limbs with donor sites for VLNT.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2014-12-04", "authors": ["Mario FScaglioni", "HirooSuami"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.047"}

The diagnostic procedures were clinical examination, dermoscopy, multimodal ultrasonography (US), using high frequency and conventional US, contact elastography, and i.v. contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).\nThe US characteristics of the basal cell carcinomas were: hypoechoic, inhomogeneous masses, with hyperechoic or anechoic areas, depending on the histological differentiation, increased rigidity, uneven vascularization at Doppler examination, central or mixed type circulatory model, with 1-2 supply vessels, velocity >2 cm/s, intensely inhomogeneous load of the contrast agent (CA) and quick wash out time. The benign tumors were hypoechoic or echoic masses, with inhomogeneous structure, Doppler signal present only in dermofibromas, peripheral circulation model, velocities < 2.00 cm/s, a weak and uneven loading of the CA in the vascular bed, and a slow wash out time. Analysis of the CA dynamics evidenced a significantly higher value for the wash out time in the malignant tumors (38.2s+/- 15.15) as compared to the benign ones (54.2s +/- 8.5). Particularly the tumor thickness examination by HFUS evidences an ultrasound index that may be considered as a statistically significant predictive factor (p<0.05), highly sensitive (r =0.97) for the non-invasive assessment of the histological Breslow index.

This may hinder the use of MSCs for articular cartilage regeneration, but opens the possibility of using engineered cartilaginous tissues for large bone defect repair. Hydrogels may be an attractive tool in the scaling-up of such tissue engineered grafts for endochondral bone regeneration. In this study, we compared the capacity of different naturally derived hydrogels (alginate, chitosan and fibrin) to support chondrogenesis and hypertrophy of MSCs in vitro and endochondral ossification in vivo. In vitro, alginate and chitosan constructs accumulated the highest levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), with chitosan constructs synthesizing the highest levels of collagen. Alginate and fibrin constructs supported the greatest degree of calcium accumulation, though only fibrin constructs calcified homogeneously. In vivo, chitosan constructs facilitated neither vascularization nor endochondral ossification, and also retained the greatest amount of sGAG, suggesting it to be a more suitable material for the engineering of articular cartilage. Both alginate and fibrin constructs facilitated vascularization and endochondral bone formation as well as the development of a bone marrow environment. Alginate constructs accumulated significantly more mineral and supported greater bone formation in central regions of the engineered tissue.

The morphology and structure of the bilayer scaffolds were examined by high-magnification scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The bilayer scaffolds demonstrated a gradual variation in through-thickness porosity and fiber alignment and an average porosity much higher than that of conventionally electrospun scaffolds (controls) with randomly distributed fibers. The biocompatibility and biological performance of the bilayer fibrous scaffolds were evaluated by in vivo experiments involving subcutaneous scaffold implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by histology and immunohistochemistry studies. The results illustrate the potential of the bilayer scaffolds to overcome major limitations of conventionally electrospun scaffolds associated with intrinsically small pores, low porosity and, consequently, poor cell infiltration. The significantly higher porosity and larger pore size of RFL enhances cell motility through the scaffold thickness, whereas the relatively dense structure of AFL provides the scaffold with the necessary mechanical strength. The bilayer scaffolds show more than two times higher cell infiltration than controls during implantation in vivo. The unique structure of the bilayer scaffolds promotes collagen fiber deposition, cell proliferation, and ingrowth of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vivo.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of in vitro chondrogenic priming time for the creation of cartilage template on the in vivo endochondral bone formation both qualitatively and quantitatively. To this end, rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded onto two scaffolds with distinguished features: a fibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) electrospun scaffold (PLGA/PCL) and a porous hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate composite (HA/TCP). The constructs were then chondrogenically differentiated for 2, 3 and 4 weeks in vitro, followed by subcutaneous implantation in vivo for up to 8 weeks. A longer chondrogenic priming time resulted in a significantly increased amount and homogeneous deposition of the cartilage matrix on both the PLGA/PCL and HA/TCP scaffolds in vitro. In vivo, all implanted constructs gave rise to endochondral bone formation, whereas the bone volume was not affected by the length of priming time. An unpolarized woven bone-like structure, with significant amounts of cartilage remaining, was generated in fibrous PLGA/PCL scaffolds, while porous HA/TCP scaffolds supported progressive lamellar-like bone formation with mature bone marrow development. These data suggest that, by utilizing a chondrogenically differentiated MSC-scaffold construct as cartilage template, 2 weeks of in vitro priming time is sufficient to generate a substantial amount of vascularized endochondral bone in vivo.

{"title": "Injectable gelatin derivative hydrogels with sustained vascular endothelial growth factor release for induced angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Injectable biomaterials are attractive for soft tissue regeneration because they are handled in a minimally invasive manner and can easily adapt to complex defects. However, inadequate vascularization of the injectable constructs has long been a barrier, leading to necrosis or volume reduction after implantation. In this work, we developed a three-step process to synthesize injectable gelatin-derived hydrogels that are capable of controlling growth factor delivery to induce angiogenesis. In our approach, tyramine was first introduced into gelatin chains to provide enzymatic crosslinking points for gel formation after injection. Next, heparin, a polysaccharide with binding domains to many growth factors, was covalently linked to the tyramine-modified gelatin. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was incorporated into the gelatin derivative by binding with the heparin in the gelatin derivative, and an injectable gel with controlled VEGF release was formed by an enzymatic catalytic reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The gelation time, mechanical properties and degradation of the gel was readily tailored by the gelatin concentration and the ratio of H2O2/HRP. Binding VEGF to heparin stabilizes this growth factor, protects it from denaturation and proteolytic degradation and subsequently prolongs the sustained release. An in vitro release study and bioactivity assay indicated that the VEGF was released in a sustained manner with high bioactivity for over 3 weeks. Furthermore, a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and animal experiments were performed to evaluate in vivo bioactivity of the VEGF released from the hydrogels. After 5 days of incubation on CAM, the number of blood vessels surrounding the heparin-modified hydrogels was increased by 2.4-fold compared with that of the control group. Deeper and denser cell infiltration and angiogenesis in the heparin-modified gelatin/VEGF gels were observed compared to the controls after being subcutaneously injected in the dorsal side of the mice for 2 weeks. Interestingly, even without the incorporation of VEGF, the heparin-modified gelatin derivative still had the capability to induce angiogenesis to a certain degree. Our results suggest that the gelatin derivative/VEGF is an excellent injectable delivery system for induced angiogenesis of soft tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["ZheLi", "TiejunQu", "ChenDing", "ChiMa", "HongchenSun", "ShirongLi", "XiaohuaLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.002"}

Human EPCCs displayed typical characteristics of endothelial cells including uptake of acLDL and formation of tube-like structures on Matrigel\u2122. In vivo, EPCCs cultured with PL triggered neovascularization. MSC/EPCC interactions promoted the maturation of newly formed luminal structures, which were detected deep within the scaffold and partly perfused, demonstrating a connection with the host vascular system.

This neovascularisation is an increasingly commonly reported feature of airway remodelling; however, the pathophysiological impact of the increased vasculature in the bronchial wall and its significance to pulmonary function in asthma are unrecognised at this time. Multiple factors capable of influencing the development and persistence of the vascular network exist within asthmatic airway tissue.

This search revealed that (1) High glucose uptake and low contrast enhancement on PET- and CT-imaging before start of treatment may correlate with poor response to therapy, (2) Low dose intensity due to treatment intolerance is related to shorter progression free survival. (3) Acquired resistance appears to be associated with rebound vascularization based on both longitudinal monitoring of contrast enhancement by CT and blood vessel counts in tumor tissue, and (4) Based on plasma cytokine and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies, interleukin-8, VEGFR-3, FGFR2 and HGF/MET emerged as potential clinical markers for chemoresistance.\nLow dose intensity, specific tumor-imaging techniques and potential biological biomarkers may be predictive for response to VEGF-targeted therapy in ccRCC.

{"title": "Anatomical study of the vascular territories of the maxilla: role of the facial artery in allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Facial composite tissue allotransplantation has recently become a surgical option. The maxilla, which forms the upper jaw and plays an important role in facial allotransplantation, consists of the maxillary and facial arteries. The maxillary artery is located deep within the tissue and considered the main artery of the maxilla; however, the facial artery is easy to access. The objective of this study was to examine the territories of the maxillary and facial arteries within the maxilla.\nWe excised and examined 22 maxillae. Of these, 18 were injected with latex and four with India ink.\nWe observed that the ascending palatine artery, which was collateral with the facial artery, vascularized the maxilla through its dorsal part. The facial artery vascularized the maxilla through its ventral part with the philtral and columellar branches of the superior labial artery. Therefore, the facial artery formed, through the nasal and palatine mucosa, an arterial circle with a dorsal and ventral pole. Angiosomes formed by both the facial and maxillary arteries were also observed. The India ink injected into the facial and maxillary arteries delineated specific territories for each artery.\nThis study allowed us to determine the anatomical structures that provide vascularization to the maxilla and describe their different forms. The whole of the maxilla was vascularized by the facial artery, despite the caution imposed by several studies on the removal of the facial artery alone. Indeed, the removal technique was found to be safer when it preserved the anastomoses between the facial and maxillary arteries. Therefore, previous clinical experience and our anatomical study definitively demonstrate that the facial artery vascularizes the maxilla.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["GaoussouTour\u00e9", "Jean-PaulMeningaud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.015"}

Nonetheless, a number of important issues continue to hamper the success of islet transplantation and must be addressed before there is widespread clinical acceptance. These include the relative inefficiency of the islet isolation process, the progressive loss of islet function over time and the need for multiple donors to achieve insulin independence.

The SFT of the oral cavity is a very uncommon entity. It is also of complicated diagnosis because of its extensive morphologic diversity and because of its similarity to many mesenchymal tumors. A 44-year-old man was referred for management of an asymptomatic lesion in the left buccal mucosa, which had been identified 10 years earlier. Intra-oral examination revealed a well-demarcated, fibroelastic, rounded exophytic mass located in the left buccal mucosa. The mass was covered with a non-ulcerated mucosa of normal color and measured approximately 4.0 cm in diameter. Histopathological examination showed proliferation of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles and in a patternless pattern, highly vascularized, with focal staghorn vessels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed diffuse positivity for CD34 and focal positivity for Bcl-2. Awareness of the morphological diversity of SFT coupled to a judicious use of appropriate immunohistochemical probes should prove valuable to accurately segregate SFT from other spindle cell neoplasms.", "journal": "Pathology, research and practice", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Denise H\u00e9len Imaculada Pereirade Oliveira", "Assis Filipe MedeirosAlbuquerque", "Matheus Dantasde Ara\u00fajo Barreto", "Cassiano Francisco WeegeNonaka", "Jos\u00e9 Sandro Pereirada Silva", "Adriano RochaGermano", "L\u00e9lia Maria GuedesQueiroz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.prp.2014.09.018"}

{"title": "Sequential delivery of immunomodulatory cytokines to facilitate the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages and enhance vascularization of bone scaffolds.", "abstract": "In normal tissue repair, macrophages exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) at early stages and a pro-healing phenotype (M2) at later stages. We have previously shown that M1 macrophages initiate angiogenesis while M2 macrophages promote vessel maturation. Therefore, we reasoned that scaffolds that promote sequential M1 and M2 polarization of infiltrating macrophages should result in enhanced angiogenesis and healing. To this end, we first analyzed the in vitro kinetics of macrophage phenotype switch using flow cytometry, gene expression, and cytokine secretion analysis. Then, we designed scaffolds for bone regeneration based on modifications of decellularized bone for a short release of interferon-gamma (IFNg) to promote the M1 phenotype, followed by a more sustained release of interleukin-4 (IL4) to promote the M2 phenotype. To achieve this sequential release profile, IFNg was physically adsorbed onto the scaffolds, while IL4 was attached via biotin-streptavidin binding. Interestingly, despite the strong interactions between biotin and streptavidin, release studies showed that biotinylated IL4 was released over 6 days. These scaffolds promoted sequential M1 and M2 polarization of primary human macrophages as measured by gene expression of ten M1 and M2 markers and secretion of four cytokines, although the overlapping phases of IFNg and IL4 release tempered polarization to some extent. Murine subcutaneous implantation model showed increased vascularization in scaffolds releasing IFNg compared to controls.

{"title": "Oxygen as a critical determinant of bone fracture healing-a multiscale model.", "abstract": "A timely restoration of the ruptured blood vessel network in order to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fracture zone is crucial for successful bone healing. Indeed, oxygen plays a key role in the aerobic metabolism of cells, in the activity of a myriad of enzymes as well as in the regulation of several (angiogenic) genes. In this paper, a previously developed model of bone fracture healing is further improved with a detailed description of the influence of oxygen on various cellular processes that occur during bone fracture healing. Oxygen ranges of the cell-specific oxygen-dependent processes were established based on the state-of-the art experimental knowledge through a rigorous literature study. The newly developed oxygen model is compared with previously published experimental and in silico results. An extensive sensitivity analysis was also performed on the newly introduced oxygen thresholds, indicating the robustness of the oxygen model. Finally, the oxygen model was applied to the challenging clinical case of a critical sized defect (3mm) where it predicted the formation of a fracture non-union. Further model analyses showed that the harsh hypoxic conditions in the central region of the callus resulted in cell death and disrupted bone healing thereby indicating the importance of a timely vascularization for the successful healing of a large bone defect. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the oxygen model is a powerful tool to further unravel the complex spatiotemporal interplay of oxygen delivery, diffusion and consumption with the several healing steps, each occurring at distinct, optimal oxygen tensions during the bone repair process.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lieCarlier", "LiesbetGeris", "Nickvan Gastel", "GeertCarmeliet", "HansVan Oosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.10.012"}

The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot.\nVRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs.

{"title": "May the remodeling of the Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit in endothelial progenitor cells derived from cancer patients suggest alternative targets for anti-angiogenic treatment?", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may be recruited from bone marrow to sustain the metastatic switch in a number of solid cancers, including breast cancer (BC) and renal cellular carcinoma (RCC). Preventing EPC mobilization causes tumor shrinkage. Novel anti-angiogenic treatments have been introduced in therapy to inhibit VEGFR-2 signaling; unfortunately, these drugs blocked tumor angiogenesis in pre-clinical murine models, but resulted far less effective in human patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving EPC proliferation and tubulogenesis in cancer patients could outline novel targets for alternative anti-angiogenic treatments. Store-operated Ca\u00b2\u207a entry (SOCE) regulates the growth of human EPCs, and it is mediated by the interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a-sensor, Stim1, and the plasmalemmal Ca\u00b2\u207a channels, Orai1 and TRPC1. EPCs do not belong to the neoplastic clone: thus, unlike tumor endothelium and neoplastic cells, they should not remodel their Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit in response to tumor microenvironment. However, our recent work demonstrated that EPCs isolated from na\u00efve RCC patients (RCC-EPCs) undergo a dramatic remodeling of their Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit by displaying a remarkable drop in the endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a content, by down-regulating the expression of inositol-1,4,5-receptors (InsP3Rs), and by up-regulating Stim1, Orai1 and TRPC1. Moreover, EPCs are dramatically less sensitive to VEGF stimulation both in terms of Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling and of gene expression when isolated from tumor patients. Conversely, the pharmacological abolition of SOCE suppresses proliferation in these cells. These results question the suitability of VEGFR-2 as a therapeutically relevant target for anti-angiogenic treatments and hint at Orai1 and TRPC1 as more promising alternatives.

Sorafenib inhibited ERK signaling in both, HC-AFW1 cells and -xenografts. In vivo, sorafenib treatment only led to a moderate tumor growth inhibition, although significant reduction of vascularization and tumor growth kinetics was observed. Long-term treatment with sorafenib decreased E-cadherin, but showed no induction of vimentin expression. Combining sorafenib with a \u03b2-catenin inhibitor led to an additional reduction of cell viability.\nSorafenib together with inhibitors of the \u03b2-catenin pathway might be an effective tool in the treatment of pediatric HCC.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["CarmenNagel", "SorinArmeanu-Ebinger", "AlexanderDewerth", "Steven WWarmann", "J\u00f6rgFuchs"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.10.018"}
{"title": "Comparison between endothelial progenitor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells on neovascularization in an adipogenesis mouse model.", "abstract": "Volume stability and growth of tissue engineered adipose tissue equivalents using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) rely strongly on angiogenesis and neovascularization to support the maintenance of cells. An attractive cellular approach is based on coimplantation of endothelial cells to create a vascular network. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell population, since they can be easily isolated from autologous human peripheral blood and thus represent a clinically feasible option. We have previously shown in in vitro and semi-in vivo studies that ASCs exert beneficial effects on EPCs in terms of enhanced tube formation and formation of blood vessels, respectively. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effects of coimplantation on endothelial cell-mediated neovascularization and ASC-mediated adipose tissue formation. For this purpose, human ASCs and human EPCs (or HUVECs as direct comparison to EPCs) were suspended alone or in coculture in fibrin and subcutaneously injected into the back of athymic nude mice and explanted after 1, 3 or 6months. Our results show that monocultures of EPCs or HUVECs were not able to perform vasculogenesis and constructs exhibited complete resorption already after 1month. However, a remarkable difference between EPCs and HUVECs was detected when coimplanted with ASCs. While coimplanted HUVECs gave rise to a stable neovasculature which was characterized by perfusion with erythrocytes, coimplanted EPCs showed no ability to form vascular structures. In the case of HUVEC-derived neovasculature, coimplanted ASCs displayed perivascular properties by stabilizing these neovessels. However, formation of human adipose tissue was independent of coimplanted endothelial cells. Our results indicate that HUVECs are superior to EPCs in terms of promoting in vivo neovascularization and recruiting perivascular cells for vessel stabilization when coimplanted with ASCs.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["ValentinHaug", "NestorTorio-Padron", "G BjoernStark", "GuenterFinkenzeller", "SandraStrassburg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2014.10.005"}
{"title": "Effects of mTOR inhibition on normal retinal vascular development in the mouse.", "abstract": "We aimed to determine the role of age-related changes in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in endothelial cell growth during retinal vascular development in mice. Mice were administered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as follows: (i) for 6 days from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P5, (ii) for 2 days on P6 and P7, and (iii) for 2 days on P12 and P13. For comparison, we examined the effects of KRN633, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase, on retinal vascular development. The retinal vasculature and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a downstream indicator of mTOR activity, were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Vascularization was delayed and capillary density was reduced in mice administered rapamycin from P0 to P5 compared to the vehicle-treated mice. Rapamycin administration on P6 and P7 decreased the vascular density but did not significantly delay the radial vascular growth. Rapamycin administration on P12 and P13 did not significantly affect the retinal superficial blood vessels. Immunoreactivity for pS6 was detected in both endothelial cells in the vascular front and non-vascular cells in the retinal parenchyma, and rapamycin markedly diminished the pS6 immunoreactivity. KRN633 administration on P0 and P1 completely inhibited retinal vascularization. The effects of KRN633 on retinal blood vessels decreased in magnitude in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest that the mTOR pathway in endothelial cells activated by VEGF contributes to physiologic vascular development, and that the mTOR pathway in endothelial cells is modulated in a postnatal age-dependent manner.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["RinaYagasaki", "TsutomuNakahara", "AsamiMori", "KenjiSakamoto", "KunioIshii"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exer.2014.11.005"}
{"title": "Abnormal development of placenta in HtrA1-deficient mice.", "abstract": "Abnormal levels of High temperature requirement A1 (HtrA1) protein have been repeatedly observed in sera and placentas of preeclampsia patients. To understand the functions of HtrA1 in placentation and in the etiology of preeclampsia, we established HtrA1(-/-) mice. HtrA1(-/-) mice show intrauterine growth retardation, and their placentas are small due to a reduced size of the junctional zone and aberrant vascularization in the labyrinth at the mid-gestation stage. HtrA1 is expressed by Tpbpa-positive trophoblast precursors in the outer ectoplacental cone and junctional zone from embryonic day 7.5 to 10.5. In the HtrA1(-/-) placenta, Tpbpa-positive cell precursors are decreased in the early stage. Spongiotrophoblasts and glycogen trophoblast cells, both of which differentiate from Tpbpa-positive precursors, are consequently decreased in the junctional zone. Fewer spiral artery-associated trophoblast giant cells, another cell type derived from Tpbpa-positive precursors, invade the decidua and associate with maternal arteries in the HtrA1(-/-) placenta than in the wild type placenta. Maternal arteries in the HtrA1(-/-) decidua have narrower lumens, thicker arterial walls, and more vascular smooth muscle cells remaining in the walls than those in the wild type decidua, indicating impaired remodeling of maternal arteries. These results indicate that HtrA1 plays important roles in the differentiation of trophoblasts from Tpbpa-positive precursors in the ectoplacental cone. Insufficient levels of HtrA1 cause poor placental development and intrauterine growth retardation, due to aberrant trophoblast differentiation and consequent defects in maternal artery remodeling, and may contribute to the onset of preeclampsia.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Md ZobaerHasan", "MuthiIkawati", "JirapornTocharus", "MasashiKawaichi", "ChioOka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.10.015"}

Lesion classification is then performed based on a statistical analysis of the blood vessels' characteristics, such as thickness, tortuosity, and density. Here, the presented algorithm is applied to 50 NBI endoscopic images of laryngeal diseases and the segmentation and classification accuracies are investigated. The experimental results show the proposed algorithm provides reliable results, reaching an overall classification accuracy rating of 84.3%. This is a highly motivating preliminary result that proves the feasibility of the new method and supports the investment in further research and development to translate this study into clinical practice.

IFPs originate from the submucosa and often extend into the overlying mucosa. Although certain IFPs infiltrate the muscularis propria focally, disruption of the muscularis propria and penetration into the subserosa is extremely rare. The current study presents an unusual case of an ileal IFP. A 48-year-old female visited the Department of Surgery, Chonbuk National University Hospital (Jeonju, Republic of Korea) due to abdominal pain. Radiological study demonstrated an ileocecal-type intussusception due to a luminal polypoid mass of the ileum. The excised tumor consisted of haphazardly arranged epithelioid and spindled cells in a fibromyxoid stroma, with an abundant vascular network, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction predominantly composed of eosinophilic infiltrates. The infiltrating tumor cells disrupted the muscularis mucosa above the tumor cells and the muscularis propria below the tumor cells, and extended into the subserosa.

Recent animal studies showed improved soft tissue regeneration using ESWT. In most cases, deep partial-thickness burns require skin grafting; the outcome is often unsatisfactory in function and aesthetic appearance. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of ESWT on skin regeneration after deep partial-thickness burns. Under general anesthesia, two standardized deep partial-thickness burns were induced on the back of 30 male Wistar rats. Immediately after the burn, ESWT was given to rats of group 1 (N = 15), but not to group 2 (N = 15). On days 5, 10, and 15, five rats of each group were analyzed. Reepithelialization rate was defined, perfusion units were measured, and histological analysis was performed. Digital photography was used for visual documentation. A wound score system was used. ESWT enhanced the percentage of wound closure in group 1 as compared to group 2 (P < 0.05). The reepithelialization rate was improved significantly on day 15 (P < 0.05). The wound score showed a significant increase in the ESWT group. ESWT improves skin regeneration of deep partial-thickness burns in rats.

For years, tissue engineering approaches have been seeking a stable, axially vascularized transplantable bone replacement suitable for transplantation into the recipient bed with pre-existing insufficient conditions. For this reason, the arteriovenous loop model was developed and various bone substitutes have been vascularized. However, it has not been possible thus far to engineer a primary stable and axially vascularized transplantable bone substitute. For that purpose, a primary stable silica-embedded nanohydroxyapatite (HA) bone substitute in combination with blood, bone marrow, expanded, or directly retransplanted mesenchymal stem cells, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2), and different carrier materials (fibrin, cell culture medium, autologous serum) was tested subcutaneously for 4 or 12 weeks in the sheep model. Autologous serum lead to an early matrix change during degradation of the bone substitute and formation of new bone tissue. The best results were achieved in the group combining mesenchymal stem cells expanded with 60 \u03bcg/mL rhBMP-2 in autologous serum. Better ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue could be detected in the autologous serum group compared with the control (fibrin). Osteoclastic activity indicating an active bone remodeling process was observed after 4 weeks, particularly in the group with autologous serum and after 12 weeks in every experimental group. This study clearly demonstrates the positive effects of autologous serum in combination with mesenchymal stem cells and rhBMP-2 on bone formation in a primary stable silica-embedded nano-HA bone grafting material in the sheep model. In further experiments, the results will be transferred to the sheep arteriovenous loop model in order to engineer an axially vascularized primary stable bone replacement in clinically relevant size for free transplantation.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2014-11-28", "authors": ["Anja MBoos", "AnnikaWeigand", "GloriaDeschler", "ThomasGerber", "AndreasArkudas", "UlrichKneser", "Raymund EHorch", "Justus PBeier"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S66867\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0126\n10.1002/stem.1559"}
{"title": "Stem cell-based approaches to improve nerve regeneration: potential implications for reconstructive transplantation?", "abstract": "Reconstructive transplantation has become a viable option to restore form and function after devastating tissue loss. Functional recovery is a key determinant of overall success and critically depends on the quality and pace of nerve regeneration. Several molecular and cell-based therapies have been postulated and tested in pre-clinical animal models to enhance nerve regeneration. Schwann cells remain the mainstay of research focus providing neurotrophic support and signaling cues for regenerating axons. Alternative cell sources such as mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stromal cells have also been tested in pre-clinical animal models and in clinical trials due to their relative ease of harvest, rapid expansion in vitro, minimal immunogenicity, and capacity to integrate and survive within host tissues, thereby overcoming many of the challenges faced by culturing of human Schwann cells and nerve allografting. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Schwann cells are of particular interest since they can provide abundant, patient-specific autologous Schwann cells. The majority of experimental evidence on cell-based therapies, however, has been generated using stem cell-seeded nerve guides that were developed to enhance nerve regeneration across \"gaps\" in neural repair. Although primary end-to-end repair is the preferred method of neurorrhaphy in reconstructive transplantation, mechanistic studies elucidating the principles of cell-based therapies from nerve guidance conduits will form the foundation of further research employing stem cells in end-to-end repair of donor and recipient nerves.

{"title": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cell: a promising biomarker in clinical oncology.", "abstract": "Human cancers are endowed with sustained vascularization capability, and their growth, invasion, and metastasis are vascularization dependent. Recently, accumulated body of evidence suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can support vasculogenesis and induce angiogenesis through paracrine mechanisms. In addition, numerous clinical studies have revealed the increase in the number of EPCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients and demonstrated the correlation of circulating EPCs (CEPCs) with the clinical outcomes. This review highlights current enrichment procedures and methods for the detection of CEPCs and different biomarkers to identify CEPCs as well as the functions of EPCs in tumor vascularization. Furthermore, we systematically review available studies on the clinical relevance of CEPCs in cancer patients to explore the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of CEPCs. Although several contrasting results exist, CEPCs can conceivably serve as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment response indication in the future.

{"title": "Diffusion and perfusion: the keys to fat grafting.", "abstract": "Fat grafting is now widely used in plastic surgery. Long-term graft retention can be unpredictable. Fat grafts must obtain oxygen via diffusion until neovascularization occurs, so oxygen delivery may be the overarching variable in graft retention.\nWe studied the peer-reviewed literature to determine which aspects of a fat graft and the microenvironment surrounding a fat graft affect oxygen delivery and created 3 models relating distinct variables to oxygen delivery and graft retention.\nOur models confirm that thin microribbons of fat maximize oxygen transport when injected into a large, compliant, well-vascularized recipient site. The \"Microribbon Model\" predicts that, in a typical human, fat injections larger than 0.16 cm in radius will have a region of central necrosis. Our \"Fluid Accommodation Model\" predicts that once grafted tissues approach a critical interstitial fluid pressure of 9 mm Hg, any additional fluid will drastically increase interstitial fluid pressure and reduce capillary perfusion and oxygen delivery. Our \"External Volume Expansion Effect Model\" predicts the effect of vascular changes induced by preoperative external volume expansion that allow for greater volumes of fat to be successfully grafted.\nThese models confirm that initial fat grafting survival is limited by oxygen diffusion. Preoperative expansion increases oxygen diffusion capacity allowing for additional graft retention. These models provide a scientific framework for testing the current fat grafting theories.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors that correlated with specific flap characteristics. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nSixty-eight patients (28 upper extremities and 40 lower extremities) were identified as undergoing preoperative duplex ultrasonography for VLN transfer. Little variation was seen when evaluating donor sites for laterality in patients. Groin and submental VLN sites had 3.1 and 3.3 lymph nodes, respectively, compared with 0.9 lymph nodes in the supraclavicular donor site (p < 0.01). Increasing age had an inverse relationship with estimated flap volume, whereas higher body mass index correlated with increasing flap thickness.\nPreoperative imaging with duplex ultrasonography before VLN transfer may allow for accurate identification of specific VLN donor-site characteristics.

ADMs allow surgeons to control implant position and obviate the need for submuscular implant placement. Here, we review the benefits and risks of using ADMs in implant-based breast reconstruction based on available data.\nA comprehensive analysis of the literature with focus on recent publications was performed. Additional information regarding the proper use of ADMs was based on our institutional experience.\nADM use may improve definition of the lateral confines of the breast and lower pole projection. It may facilitate direct-to-implant procedures and improve aesthetic outcomes. The effect of ADMs on complication rates remains controversial. Known patient risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and radiotherapy should be considered during patient selection. For patients with healthy, well-vascularized skin envelopes, ADM-assisted direct-to- implant reconstruction is a safe and cost-effective alternative to 2-stage implant reconstruction, with low complication rates. ADMs may be used to treat capsular contracture, and limited available data further suggest the possibility that ADMs may reduce the risk of capsular contracture. Novel synthetic or biosynthetic tissue reinforcement devices with different physical and ease-of-use properties than ADMs are emerging options for reconstructive surgeons and patients who seek to avoid tissue products from human or mammalian cadavers.\nADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction may improve aesthetic outcomes.

We describe a strategy to generate customized ECM, designed to activate endogenous regenerative programs by recapitulating tissue-specific developmental processes. The paradigm was exemplified in the context of the skeletal system by testing the osteoinductive capacity of engineered and devitalized hypertrophic cartilage, which is the primordial template for the development of most bones. ECM was engineered by inducing chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stromal cells and devitalized by the implementation of a death-inducible genetic device, leading to cell apoptosis on activation and matrix protein preservation. The resulting hypertrophic cartilage ECM, tested in a stringent ectopic implantation model, efficiently remodeled to form de novo bone tissue of host origin, including mature vasculature and a hematopoietic compartment. Importantly, cartilage ECM could not generate frank bone tissue if devitalized by standard \"freeze & thaw\" (F&T) cycles, associated with a significant loss of glycosaminoglycans, mineral content, and ECM-bound cytokines critically involved in inflammatory, vascularization, and remodeling processes. These results support the utility of engineered ECM-based devices as off-the-shelf regenerative niches capable of recruiting and instructing resident cells toward the formation of a specific tissue.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-11-26", "authors": ["Paul EBourgine", "CelesteScotti", "SebastienPigeot", "Laurent ATchang", "AtanasTodorov", "IvanMartin"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1411975111"}

Omentum has been used clinically to promote revascularization and healing of ischemic tissues. We hypothesized that cell-sheet transplantation covered with an omentum-flap would effectively establish mature blood vessels and improve coronary microcirculation physiology, enhancing the therapeutic effects of cell-sheet therapy. Rats were divided into four groups after coronary ligation; skeletal myoblast cell-sheet plus omentum-flap (combined), cell-sheet only, omentum-flap only, and sham operation. At 4 weeks after the treatment, the combined group showed attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and a greater amount of functionally (CD31(+)/lectin(+)) and structurally (CD31(+)/\u03b1-SMA(+)) mature blood vessels, along with myocardial upregulation of relevant genes. Synchrotron-based microangiography revealed that the combined procedure increased vascularization in resistance arterial vessels with better dilatory responses to endothelium-dependent agents. Serial (13)N-ammonia PET showed better global coronary flow reserve in the combined group, mainly attributed to improvement in the basal left ventricle.

However, the low survival rate of MSCs at local diseased tissue reduces the therapeutic efficacy. We therefore investigated the influence of MicroRNA-378 (miR-378) transfection on MSCs survival and vascularization under hypoxic-ischemic condition in vitro.\nMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in vitro. The third passage of MSCs were divided into the miR-378 group and control group. For the miR-378 group, cells were transfected with miR-378 mimic. Both groups experienced exposure to hypoxia (1% O2) and serum deprivation for 24 hours, using normoxia (20% O2) as a negative control during the process. After 24 hours of reoxygenation (20% O2), cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated. Expressions of apoptosis and angiogenesis related genes were detected. Both groups were further co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells to promote vascular differentiation for another 6 hours. Vascular density was assessed thereafter.\nCompared with the control group, MSCs transfected with miR-378 showed more rapid growth. Their proliferation rates were much higher at 72 h and 96 h under hypoxic condition (257.33% versus 246.67%, P <0.01; 406.84% versus 365.39%, P <0.05).

VEGFR2, a critical endothelial receptor for VEGF, was more abundantly expressed in retinal neurons than in endothelial cells, including endothelial tip cells. Genetic deletion of VEGFR2 in neurons caused misdirected angiogenesis toward neurons, resulting in abnormally increased vascular density around neurons. Further genetic experiments revealed that this misdirected angiogenesis was attributable to an excessive amount of VEGF protein around neurons caused by insufficient engulfment of VEGF by VEGFR2-deficient neurons. Moreover, absence of neuronal VEGFR2 caused misdirected regenerative angiogenesis in ischemic retinopathy.

In the previous literature, morphometric approaches to evaluate these changes have considered quantitative first order parameters, such as volumes or densities, while changes in spatial disposition and/or complexity of structural components have not yet been considered. In the present study, different strategies for addressing morphological complexity of CB, apart from the overall amount of each tissue component, were evaluated and compared. In particular, we considered the spatial distribution of connective tissue in the carotid bodies of young control subjects, young opiate-related deaths and aged subjects, through analysis of dispersion (Morisita's index), gray level co-occurrence matrix (entropy, angular second moment, variance, correlation), and fractal analysis (fractal dimension, lacunarity). Opiate-related deaths and aged subjects showed a comparable increase in connective tissue with respect to young controls. However, the Morisita's index (p < 0.05), angular second moment (p < 0.05), fractal dimension (p < 0.01), and lacunarity (p < 0.01) permitted to identify significant differences in the disposition of the connective tissue between these two series.

The fractal dimension and lacunarity, with areas under the ROC curve of 0.9651 (excellent accuracy) and 0.8835 (good accuracy), respectively, showed the highest discriminatory power.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have previously been shown to play an important role in neovascularization and deficiencies in these cells have been described in aged patients. Here we utilize single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the effect of aging on MSC population dynamics. We identify an age-related depletion of a subpopulation of MSCs characterized by a pro-vascular transcriptional profile. Supporting this finding, we demonstrate that aged MSCs are also significantly compromised in their ability to support vascular network formation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, aged MSCs are unable to rescue age-associated impairments in cutaneous wound healing. Taken together, these data suggest that age-related changes in MSC population dynamics result in impaired therapeutic potential of aged progenitor cells.

She had a seven-month history of gradually worsening weakness and numbness in her lower extremities. Imaging studies of her thoracic spine demonstrated a heterogeneously well-enhancing mass, located in her posterior epidural space without surrounding bone erosion at the upper thoracic level. We also observed compression of her thoracic cord. During surgery, a reddish-gray, highly vascularized mass was excised. Her facet joints had to be resected to expose the part migrating into the intervertebral foramen.

Thirty specimens obtained within 72 hours of death were used for microscopic analysis. Thirty specimens were previously frozen and used for macroscopic analysis. The tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneal arteries were injected with India Ink and Ward's Blue Latex.

She had undergone trabeculectomy with mitomycin C 14 years ago. Slit-lamp examination showed an ischemic and ruptured bleb, excessive bleb leakage, and an extremely shallow anterior chamber. A large scleral defect was vaguely observed through the bleb conjunctiva. The hypotony was attributed to excessive bleb leakage. A surgical revision was required. First, the avascular bleb conjunctiva and the melted scleral flap were excised. A scleral defect was observed. Thick fibrotic tissue, i.e., the autologous Tenon's graft, was separated from the underlying sclera, cut to the desired size to cover the defect, and sutured to the sclera with 10-0 nylon sutures. Irrigation with balanced salt solution through the paracentesis confirmed deepening of the anterior chamber with no bleb leakage. In the current case, a layer of amniotic membrane was applied to cover the largely exposed sclera. Two weeks postoperatively, the surgical site was totally re-epi-thelialized with no aqueous leakage. Three months postoperatively, vascularization into the surgical site was observed. The intraocular pressure remained within normal levels without recurrent bleb leakage.\nAutologous transplantation of a free Tenon's graft successfully repaired excessive bleb leakage through a scleral defect after trabeculectomy.

Traditional histological as well as immunohistochemical methods have been used.\nThe study reveals that the occurrence of blood capillaries in surface squamous epithelium is an ordinary event, both in healthy persons and in peritumoral regions of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Glandular epithelial coverings, as well as transitional epithelium, do not contain blood vessels. In squamous epithelium, only basal cells are in contact with the membrane and underlying stroma, the cells of the upper layer receiving nutrients through diffusion. Thus, the cells of squamous epithelium are more vulnerable to blood deficiency, since for instance in the pseudo-multilayered respiratory epithelium each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has more ample access to the blood supply. Metaplastic squamous epithelium has a markedly reduced vascularization and seems to be more sensitive to carcinogenic stimuli. High-grade dysplastic squamous epithelium and carcinoma in situ do not contain blood vessels.\nThe process of redistribution of vascular network occurring at the interface of epithelial-stromal frontier plays an important role in maintaining the adequate metabolism of cells including those of epithelial covering.

Porcine skin shares many physical properties with human skin, but is susceptible to hyperacute rejection due to preformed antibodies to \u03b1-1,3-galactose (Gal), a carbohydrate on all porcine cells. Our preliminary studies have suggested that skin grafts from \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock out (GalT-KO) miniature swine might provide temporary wound coverage comparable to allografts, since GalT-KO swine lack this carbohydrate. To further evaluate this possibility, eight non-human primates received primary autologous, allogeneic, GalT-KO, and GalT+xenogeneic skin grafts. Additionally, secondary grafts were placed to assess whether sensitization would affect the rejection time course of identical-type grafts. We demonstrate that both GalT-KO xenografts and allografts provide temporary coverage of partial- and full-thickness wounds for up to 11 days. In contrast, GalT+xenografts displayed hyperacute rejection, with no signs of vascularization and rapid avulsion from wounds. Furthermore, secondary GalT-KO transplants failed to vascularize, demonstrating that primary graft rejection sensitizes the recipient. We conclude that GalT-KO xenografts may provide temporary coverage of wounds for a duration equivalent to allografts, and thus, could serve as a readily available alternative treatment of severe burns.", "journal": "Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries", "date": "2014-11-20", "authors": ["Angelo ALeto Barone", "MelissaMastroianni", "Evan AFarkash", "ChristopherMallard", "AlexanderAlbritton", "RadbehTorabi", "David ALeonard", "Josef MKurtz", "David HSachs", "Curtis LCetrulo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.burns.2014.09.003"}

Surprisingly, only BM-derived MSCs spontaneously formed a BM cavity through a vascularized cartilage intermediate in vivo that was progressively replaced by hematopoietic tissue and bone. Only BM-derived MSCs exhibited a chondrogenic transcriptional program with hypomethylation and increased expression of RUNX3, RUNX2, BGLAP, MMP13, and ITGA10 consistent with a latent and primed skeletal developmental potential. The humanized MSC-derived microenvironment permitted homing and maintenance of long-term murine SLAM(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as human CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD90(+)/CD45RA(+) HSCs after cord blood transplantation.

{"title": "[Mechanism of thymosin beta 10 inhibiting the apoptosis \u2029and prompting proliferation in A549 cells].", "abstract": "Thymosin beta 10 (T\u03b210) is one of \u03b2-thymosin family members, has a highly conserved polar 5 kDa peptides. This peptide is now regarded to be a small actin-binding protein and thereby induce depolymerization of the intracellular F-actin networks. Alteration of T\u03b210 expression may alter the balance of cell growth, cell death, cell attachment and cell migration. T\u03b210 also affects cell metastasis as well as proliferation, apoptosis and vascularization of cancer cells. But function of T\u03b210 appear to be rather different between cancer cells, and the molecular mechanisms of \u03b2-thymosins to regulate cell apoptosis and proliferation in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines are unclear. In this study, we used lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, added T\u03b210 or down-regulated the expression of T\u03b210. We observed the change of apoptosis, proliferation and cell cyclin ability in A549 and the mechanisms underline them were also identified.\nAfter A549 was treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant human T\u03b210 or siT\u03b210, apoptosis rate of A549 and cell cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). CCK-8 assay was employed to determine the proliferation of A549. The mRNA level of P53, Caspase-3, Cyclin A and Cyclin E were determined by real-time PCR. The protein level of P53, Caspase-3, Cyclin A and Cyclin E were detected by Western blot.\nAdd T\u03b210 can inhibit the apoptosis and prompt the proliferation of A549. It can also increase the cell rates of S-phrase and G2/M-phrase, decrease the expression of P53 and Caspase-3, but increase the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E. Interferance of T\u03b210 can prompt the apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of A549. It can also increase the cell rates of G0/G1-phrase, increase the expression of P53 and Caspase-3, but decrease the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E.\nIn lung cancer cell line, T\u03b210 can inhibit the apoptosis by increase P53, drive cells into the S and G2/M-phase, prompt cell proliferation by increase the expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E. T\u03b210 may become a potential biomarker and therapy target for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u03b210\uff08thymisin \u03b210, T\u03b210\uff09\u662f\u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u57285 kDa\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u662f\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u542b\u91cf\u6700\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u03b2\u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u808c\u52a8\u86cb\u767d\u7ed3\u5408\u86cb\u767d\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u808c\u52a8\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u53d8\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u751f\u957f\u3001\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3001\u7c98\u9644\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002T\u03b210\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u51cb\u4ea1\u3001\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u53d1\u6325\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800cT\u03b210\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u4e2d\u6240\u53d1\u6325\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u4e14T\u03b210\u5bf9\u80ba\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u548c\u51cb\u4ea1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u89c1\u6587\u732e\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u62e9\u80ba\u817a\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u7cfbA549\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165T\u03b210\u6216\u7528\u5c0f\u5e72\u6270RNA\u5e72\u6270T\u03b210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80ba\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u3001\u589e\u6b96\u53ca\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8T\u03b210\u5bf9\u80ba\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u8fd9\u51e0\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u6d41\u5f0f\u53cc\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u52a0\u5165T\u03b210\u6216\u5e72\u6270T\u03b210\u540e\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cPI\u67d3\u8272\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cCCK-8\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cReal-time PCR\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u514d\u75ab\u5370\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4b\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u51cb\u4ea1\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u52a0\u5165T\u03b210\u80fd\u6291\u5236A549\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u51cb\u4ea1\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u589e\u6b96\uff0c\u589e\u52a0S\u671f\u548cG2\u671f/M\u671f\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11Caspase-3\u3001P53\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0Cyclin A\u3001Cyclin E\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u5e72\u6270T\u03b210\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdbA549\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u51cb\u4ea1\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u589e\u6b96\uff0c\u589e\u52a0G0\u671f/G1\u671f\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u52a0Caspase-3\u3001P53\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11Cyclin A\u3001Cyclin E\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u5728\u80ba\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u7cfb\u4e2dT\u03b210\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236P53\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8c03Cyclin A\u3001Cyclin E\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u589e\u6b96\u3002T\u03b210\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u53ca\u6cbb\u7597\u9776\u6807\u3002", "journal": "Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer", "date": "2014-11-19", "authors": ["ZixuanLi", "LianyueQu", "HongshanZhong", "KeXu", "XueshanQiu"], "doi": "10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2014.11.03\n10.3322/caac.v63.1\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2003.08.010\n10.3109/07357900902849640\n10.3109/07357907.2012.756111\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.10.001\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204683\n10.1016/j.humpath.2008.06.023\n10.1186/1471-2407-13-430\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035399\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.01.009\n10.1002/(ISSN)1097-4652\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1111/pin.2005.55.issue-3"}
{"title": "Gallic acid exhibits risks of inducing muscular hemorrhagic liposis and cerebral hemorrhage--its action mechanism and preventive strategy.", "abstract": "Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) (GA) occurs in many plants. The adverse effects of GA are seldom cited. GA (6-14\u2009\u03bcM) provoked the hemorrhagic liposis of the cervical muscles and intracranial hemorrhage. The cause of these pathological events and the method for prevention are still lacking. Using the chicken embryo model and some selected nutraceutics such as folate, glutathione (GSH), N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin E (Vit E), we carried out this study. Results revealed that the action mechanism of GA involved (i) inducing hypoxia with upregulated gene hif-1\u03b1 and downregulated ratio vegf-r2/vegf-a, leading to dys-vascularization and myopathy; (ii) impairing cytochrome c oxidase; (iii) stimulating creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase release; (iv) eliciting carnitine accumulation and liposis via downregulating gene CPT1; (v) suppressing superoxide dismutase and stimulating NO, H2O2, and malondialdehyde; and (vi) depleting erythrocytic and tissue GSH, resulting in hemorrhage. When both Vit E and GSH were applied to the day\u20091 chicks, a better alleviation effect was revealed. Conclusively, GA potentially exhibits adverse effect by eliciting hemorrhagic liposis of cervical muscles and cerebral hemorrhage. Supplementation with GSH, Vit E, and N-acetylcysteine is able to ameliorate these adverse effects, warranting the importance of restricting the clinical phytotherapeutic doses of GA and related compounds.", "journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "date": "2014-11-19", "authors": ["Chiu-LanHsieh", "Chien-HongLin", "Hui-ErWang", "Chiung-ChiPeng", "Robert YPeng"], "doi": "10.1002/ptr.5249"}

The current study contains rare reports on the transcriptional regulation of survivin expression in retinal neovascularization (NV). The aim of this study was to investigate hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and survivin expression in pathologic ocular angiogenesis and to determine their correlation and cellular location. The model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by exposing 75% oxygen from postnatal day 7 (p7) to p12 and then followed by room air. Fluorescence angiography, immunostaining and HE staining were used to assess the visualization of retinal vascularization and the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and survivin protein in retina oxygen-induced retinopathy was characterized by clusters of neovascularization and regions of non-perfusion. HIF-1\u03b1 and survivin were both highly expressed in OIR and a positive correlation existed between HIF-1\u03b1 and survivin expression. In OIR, there was more HIF1-\u03b1 protein expression in the inner nuclear layer (INL), the ganglion cell layer (GCL), and more neovascularization breaking through the inner retina and survivin protein was detected in GCL, and more neovascularization breaking through the inner retina. Our study had shown that both HIF1-\u03b1 and survivin are involved in the retinal neovaccularization. Meanwhile HIF1-\u03b1 and survivin have differential cellular location in retinal ischemia, and HIF1-\u03b1 might be a critical transcription factor involved in the regulation of survivin expression.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental pathology", "date": "2014-11-18", "authors": ["NingningLiu", "YizhouSun", "NingZhao", "LeiChen"], "doi": null}

Defining the mechanisms by which the lymphatic vasculature is constructed and remodeled into a functional vascular network not only provides answers to fascinating biological questions, but is fundamental to understanding how lymphatic vessel growth and development goes awry in human pathologies. While long recognized as dysfunctional in lymphedema and exploited as a route of tumor metastasis, recent work has highlighted important roles for lymphatic vessels in modulating immune responses, regulating salt-sensitive hypertension and important for lung inflation at birth. Substantial progress in our understanding of the signaling pathways important for development and morphogenesis of the lymphatic vasculature has been made in recent years. Here, we review advances in our knowledge of the best characterized of these signaling pathways, that involving the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members VEGF-C and VEGF-D, together with their receptors VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.

{"title": "An epiallele at cly1 affects the expression of floret closing (cleistogamy) in barley.", "abstract": "The swelling of the lodicule is responsible for floret opening in many grass species, allowing for pollen dispersal and cross-pollination. In barley, the closed floret habit (cleistogamy) is under the control of cly1, a gene that operates by inhibiting the development of the lodicule. In non-cleistogamous cultivars, cly1 mRNA is degraded by miR172-directed cleavage, allowing the lodicules to swell; however, in cultivars carrying the recessive allele cly1.b, a single-nucleotide substitution destroys the miR172 target site preventing mRNA cleavage. Barley cv. SV235 is cleistogamous; its cly1 coding sequence is identical to that of cly1.b, but its lodicules do develop, although insufficiently to produce a non-cleistogamous flower. In this cultivar, the downregulation of cly1 is unrelated to miR172-directed mRNA degradation, but rather is caused by an epiallele that represses transcription. Allelic relationships between known cly1 alleles were explored by the quantification of lodicule vascularization and an assessment of the response of the spike to the supply of exogenous auxin. The SV235 phenotype can be manipulated by a pre-anthesis application of 2,4-d, a feature that could be of interest in the context of hybrid barley grain production based on cleistogamy.", "journal": "Genetics", "date": "2014-11-16", "authors": ["NingWang", "ShunzongNing", "JianzhongWu", "AkemiTagiri", "TakaoKomatsuda"], "doi": "10.1534/genetics.114.171652"}

Eighty kV DE as well as reconstructed 120\u2009kV equivalent DE datasets were evaluated in comparison to correlating digital subtraction angiography (DSA) datasets. Two radiologists evaluated in consensus the delineation of liver arteries and extrahepatic non-target vessels utilizing a 4-point scale (4\u2009=\u2009excellent delineation; 1\u2009=\u2009non-diagnostic). In addition, the arterial vascularization of liver segment IV was evaluated and classified: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR; liver arteries to adjacent liver tissue) were obtained via ROI analysis.\nBoth imaging techniques (DECT, DSA) enabled high-quality assessment of all analyzed liver arteries. Out of the two CT datasets, 80\u2009kVp-DE datasets offered superior delineation of the right gastric artery (3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 vs. 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5), the vascularization of segment IV (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5) as well as potential extrahepatic non-target vessels (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5).

The angiogenic (new vessels from existing vessels) and vasculogenic (new vessels through self-assembly) potential of the SVF cell population may provide a cell source for directly treating (i.e., point of care without further cell isolation) ischemic tissues. However the correct dosage of adipose SVF cells required to achieve a functional vasculature has not been established. Accordingly, in vitro and in vivo dose response assays were performed evaluating the SVF cell vasculogenic potential. Serial dilutions of freshly isolated rat adipose SVF cells were plated on growth factor reduced Matrigel and vasculogenesis, assessed as cellular tube-like network assembly, was quantified after 3 days of culture. This in vitro vasculogenesis assay indicated that rat SVF cells reached maximum network length at a concentration of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(5) cells/ml and network maintained at the higher concentrations tested. The same concentrations of rat and human SVF cells were used to evaluate vasculogenesis in vivo. SVF cells were incorporated into collagen gels and subcutaneously implanted into Rag1 immunodeficient mice. The 3D confocal images of harvested constructs were evaluated to quantify dose dependency of SVF cell vasculogenesis potential. Rat- and human-derived SVF cells yielded a maximum vasculogenic potential at 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) and 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) cells/ml, respectively. No adverse reactions (e.g., toxicity, necrosis, tumor formation) were observed at any concentration tested.

However, the contribution of these non-glycolytic functions in tumor progression remains poorly defined. Here, we show that elevated expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), but not of other glycolytic enzymes tested, increased aggressiveness and vascularization of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Elevated GAPDH expression was found to promote nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation via binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), enhancing the transcription and the activity of hypoxia-inducing factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). Consistent with this, inactive mutants of GAPDH failed to bind TRAF2, enhance HIF-1 activity or promote lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, elevated expression of gapdh mRNA in biopsies from diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients correlated with high levels of hif-1\u03b1, vegf-a, nfkbia mRNA and CD31 staining.

The most common indication for operative intervention was a complicated wound with VAD exposure (5/12, 41.7%). All patients underwent aggressive operative debridement, and 11/12 (92%) underwent vascularized soft tissue coverage.

The potential of AR navigation as a tool to improve safety of the surgical dissection is outlined for robotic hepatectomy.\nThree patients underwent a fully robotic and AR-assisted hepatic segmentectomy. The 3D virtual anatomical model was obtained using a thoracoabdominal CT scan with a customary software (VR-RENDER\u00ae, IRCAD).

A computer scientist manually registered virtual and real images using a video mixer (MX 70; Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ) in real time.\nTwo totally robotic AR segmentectomy V and one segmentectomy VI were performed. AR allowed for the precise and safe recognition of all major vascular structures during the procedure. Total time required to obtain AR was 8 min (range 6-10 min). Each registration (alignment of the vascular anatomy) required a few seconds. Hepatic pedicle clamping was never performed. At the end of the procedure, the remnant liver was correctly vascularized.

Previous studies reported reconstruction with flaps including \"vascularized\" nerves; however, few have evaluated blood supply to these nerves.

Intraoperative ICG fluorescent angiography was performed. Time after the drug injection and the intensity of fluorescence in these nerves were analyzed as time-intensity curves. Maximum intensity (Imax), time to Imax (Tmax), and time at the beginning of intensity elevation (Te) were measured at three points: Point C, the central portion of the flap-attached region of the nerve; Point P, 2 cm from the proximal flap-attached edge; and Point D, 2 cm from the distal edge.\nImax and Te at point C and Imax/Tmax-Te at point P were significantly different between these two nerves (p\u2009=\u20090.03125, p\u2009=\u20090.02895, p\u2009=\u20090.03125, respectively).

{"title": "Adenosine stimulates angiogenesis by up-regulating production of thrombospondin-1 by macrophages.", "abstract": "Increase of blood capillary density at the interface between normal and ischemic tissue after acute MI reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function. Cardiac injury triggers the production of the matricellular component TSP-1, but its role in angiogenesis is not clear, as both anti- and proangiogenic properties have been reported. It is unknown whether TSP-1 is modulated by other factors released during cardiac injury. Among these, Ado is a well-known promoter of angiogenesis. This study determined whether Ado modulates TSP-1 expression and the implication on angiogenesis. Ado dose dependently increased the production of TSP-1 by human macrophages. With the use of agonists and antagonists of AdoRs, coupled to RNA interference, we observed that this effect is mediated via A2AR and A2BR. The Ado effect was reproduced by cholera toxin (Gs protein activator) and forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator) and blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89. Conditioned medium from Ado-treated macrophages stimulated microvessel outgrowth from aortic ring explants by 400%, and induced vessel formation in matrigel plugs. Microvessel outgrowth and vessel formation were blocked completely by addition of anti-TSP-1 antibodies to conditioned medium. Chronic administration of Ado to rats after MI maintained long-term expression of TSP-1 in the infarct border zone, and this was associated with enhanced border-zone vascularization. Ado up-regulates TSP-1 production by macrophages, resulting in stimulation of angiogenesis. The mechanism involves A2AR and A2BR and is mediated through the cAMP/PKA pathway.

The new species, G. madiba, differs from its unique congener, G. prima from the late Olenekian of European Russia, most notably in having large bony bosses on the lateral surfaces of the jugals and postorbitals. The new species also has more teeth and a proportionately longer postacetabular process of the ilium than G. prima. Analysis of G. madiba bone histology reveals thick compact cortices comprised of highly vascularized, rapidly forming fibro-lamellar bone tissue, similar to Erythrosuchus africanus from Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone. The most notable differences between the two taxa are the predominance of a radiating vascular network and presence of annuli in the limb bones of G. madiba. These features indicate rapid growth rates, consistent with data for many other Triassic archosauriforms, but also a high degree of developmental plasticity as growth remained flexible. The diagnoses of Garjainia and of Erythrosuchidae are addressed and revised. Garjainia madiba is the geologically oldest erythrosuchid known from the Southern Hemisphere, and demonstrates that erythrosuchids achieved a cosmopolitan biogeographical distribution by the end of the Early Triassic, within five million years of the end-Permian mass extinction event. It provides new insights into the diversity of the Subzone A vertebrate assemblage, which partially fills a major gap between classic 'faunal' assemblages from the older Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone (earliest Triassic) and the younger Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone (early Middle Triassic).", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-11-12", "authors": ["David JGower", "P JohnHancox", "JenniferBotha-Brink", "Andrey GSennikov", "Richard JButler"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0111154\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017114\n10.1371/journal.pone.0013425"}

Histologic, histochemical, immunhistologic, and histomorphometric analysis methodologies were applied. The dermis-derived material underwent an early degradation while inducing mononuclear cells together with some multinucleated giant cells and mild vascularization. The pericardium-derived membrane induced 2 different cellular tissue reactions. The compact surface induced mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells, and underwent a complete degradation until day 30. The spongy surface of the membrane induced mainly mononuclear cells, and served as a stable barrier membrane for up to 60 days. No transmembranous vascularization was observed within the spongy material surface layer.

{"title": "A perspective on the role of class III semaphorin signaling in central nervous system trauma.", "abstract": "Traumatic injury of the central nervous system (CNS) has severe impact on the patients' quality of life and initiates many molecular and cellular changes at the site of insult. Traumatic CNS injury results in direct damage of the axons of CNS neurons, loss of myelin sheaths, destruction of the surrounding vascular architecture and initiation of an immune response. Class III semaphorins (SEMA3s) are present in the neural scar and influence a wide range of molecules and cell types in and surrounding the injured tissue. SEMA3s and their receptors, neuropilins (NRPs) and plexins (PLXNs) were initially studied because of their involvement in repulsive axon guidance. To date, SEMA3 signaling is recognized to be of crucial importance for re-vascularization, the immune response and remyelination. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss how SEMA3s modulate these processes that are all crucial components of the tissue response to injury. Most of the functions for SEMA3s are achieved through their binding partners NRPs, which are also co-receptors for a variety of other molecules implicated in the above processes. The most notable ligands are members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and the transforming growth factor family. Therefore, a second aim is to highlight the overlapping or competing signaling pathways that are mediated through NRPs in the same processes.

In the near future, it will probably be possible to generate a complete vital tooth from a single stem cell. Pulp revascularization is dependent on the ability of residual pulp and apical and periodontal stem cells to differentiate. These cells have the ability to generate a highly vascularized and a conjunctive rich living tissue. This one is able to colonize the available pulp space. Revascularization is a new treatment method for immature necrotic permanent teeth. Up to now, apexification procedures were applied for these teeth, using calcium dihydroxide or MTA to produce an artificial apical barrier. However, the pulp revascularization allows the stimulation of the apical development and the root maturation of immature teeth. Two pulp revascularization techniques are used in the literature, one using calcium dihydroxide and the second using a triple antibiotic paste. Based on these two different pulp revascularization protocols, which obtain the desired therapeutic success, the literature will be reviewed and analyzed according to the relevance of their choice of materials.

An extensive hemipelvectomy and reconstruction was performed over two days. A free thigh and leg fillet flap together with ipsilateral fibula flap, based on the superficial femoral artery and venae comitantes, was used for spinal reinforcement as well as abdominal and pelvic wall reconstruction. The postoperative course was uneventful without complications, no flap compromise or wound healing problems. After a follow-up period of 4 months, the patient had no complications and returned to activities of daily living with mild limitations.

Palatogenesis involves a complex choreography of palatal shelf elongation, elevation, and fusion. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) canonical signaling is required during each stage of palate development. The type III TGF\u03b2 receptor (TGF\u03b2R3) binds all three TGF\u03b2 ligands and BMP2, but its contribution to palatogenesis is unknown.\nThe role of TGF\u03b2R3 during palate formation was found to be during palatal shelf elongation and elevation. Tgfbr3(-) (/) (-) embryos displayed reduced palatal shelf width and height, changes in proliferation and apoptosis, and reduced vascular and osteoblast differentiation. Abnormal vascular plexus organization as well as aberrant expression of arterial (Notch1, Alk1), venous (EphB4), and lymphatic (Lyve1) markers was also observed. Decreased osteoblast differentiation factors (Runx2, alk phos, osteocalcin, col1A1, and col1A2) demonstrated poor mesenchymal cell commitment to the osteoblast lineage within the maxilla and palatal shelves in Tgfbr3(-) (/) (-) embryos. Additionally, in vitro bone mineralization induced by osteogenic medium (OM+BMP2) was insufficient in Tgfbr3(-) (/) (-) palatal mesenchyme, but mineralization was rescued by overexpression of TGF\u03b2R3.\nThese data reveal a critical, previously unrecognized role for TGF\u03b2R3 in vascular and osteoblast development during palatogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2014-11-11", "authors": ["Cynthia RHill", "Britni HJacobs", "Christopher BBrown", "Joey VBarnett", "Steven LGoudy"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.24225"}

The intention of this study was to evaluate contemporary trends in etiology, diagnosis, management, and outcome of SBO and to draw the clinician's attention on this probably underestimated disease. Over a 6-year period we performed this systematic study in an academic quaternary medical care and skull base center including 20 patients (mean age 63.7 years) with central SBO, which is one of the largest series from a single center. In contrast to previous studies we explicitly excluded infections limited to malignant external otitis only but did not restrict central SBO to conditions unrelated to aural pathology. Fifteen patients had otogenic and five sinugenic SBO; four patients had fungal or mixed fungal infections. Pre-existing illnesses altering bone vascularization were detected in 70 % of the patients and had a negative effect on the improvement of cranial nerve palsies that were found in 14 patients. In relation, patients with otogenic SBO more often had local and systemic predisposing factors. Contrary to previous studies 16 patients (80 %) underwent surgical therapy and none of our patients died. A meta-analysis of five recent studies was done and compared with our own data and two previous meta-analyses. The present study highlights several important aspects with major implications for diagnosis and treatment of SBO that have not been adequately addressed as yet.

{"title": "Combination strategy targeting VEGF and HGF/c-met in human renal cell carcinoma models.", "abstract": "Alternative pathways to the VEGF, such as hepatocyte growth factor or HGF/c-met, are emerging as key players in tumor angiogenesis and resistance to anti-VEGF therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a combination strategy targeting the VEGF and c-met pathways in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) models. Male SCID mice (8/group) were implanted with 786-O tumor pieces and treated with either a selective VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, axitinib (36 mg/kg, 2\u00d7/day); a c-met inhibitor, crizotinib (25 mg/kg, 1\u00d7/day); or combination. We further tested this drug combination in a human ccRCC patient-derived xenograft, RP-R-01, in both VEGF-targeted therapy-sensitive and -resistant models. To evaluate the resistant phenotype, we established an RP-R-01 sunitinib-resistant model by continuous sunitinib treatment (60 mg/kg, 1\u00d7/day) of RP-R-01-bearing mice. Treatment with single-agent crizotinib reduced tumor vascularization but failed to inhibit tumor growth in either model, despite also a significant increase of c-met expression and phosphorylation in the sunitinib-resistant tumors. In contrast, axitinib treatment was effective in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth in both models, with its antitumor effect significantly increased by the combined treatment with crizotinib, independently from c-met expression. Combination treatment also induced prolonged survival and significant tumor growth inhibition in the 786-O human RCC model. Overall, our results support the rationale for the clinical testing of combined VEGF and HGF/c-met pathway blockade in the treatment of ccRCC, both in first- and second-line setting.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2014-11-09", "authors": ["EricCiamporcero", "Kiersten MarieMiles", "RemiAdelaiye", "SwathiRamakrishnan", "LiShen", "ShengYuKu", "StefaniaPizzimenti", "BarbaraSennino", "GiuseppinaBarrera", "RobertoPili"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0094"}

Nowadays, precise and accurate imaging techniques are at hand for every diagnostician. However, many studies have described intraoperative occurrence of horseshoe kidney. Although the harvesting procedure in the case of horseshoe kidney is not technically difficult, graft separation for successful renal transplantation is a challenge. The complex anatomy of malformed organs causes issues during kidney separation. This procedure may lead to damage of the collecting urinary system as well as vascularization damage. Separate graft transplantation is probable when a thin isthmus in a horseshoe kidney is present. Otherwise, poor graft function may occur. We present a technique for horseshoe kidney separation with the use of methylene blue for vascularization determination. The above-mentioned procedure was performed with the methylene blue solution dose injected into a single renal graft artery. Even with the malformed organ's thick isthmus, the exact incision line was identified, exposing vascular perfusion asymmetry and allowing precise renal graft separation.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2014-11-09", "authors": ["JSie\u0144ko", "M JKotowski", "ANowacki", "MRomanowski", "TSulikowski", "MOstrowski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.09.099"}
{"title": "Dramatic recurrence of cancer in a patient who underwent kidney transplantation--case report.", "abstract": "Besides cardiovascular diseases and infections, cancers are the main cause of death in patients after transplantation of a vascularized organ. After transplantation, usually de novo cancers develop. Recurrences of cancers that had been diagnosed and treated before transplantation are much rarer. In exceptional cases, cancer is transferred with the donor's organ. The epidemiology and the course of post-transplantation de novo neoplasia is relatively well known. However, the issue of recurrence of pre-transplantation cancer, which is significantly rarer and its course more individualized and difficult to predict, poses a challenge to contemporary transplantation.\nThis paper presents an unexpectedly rapid recurrence of rare cancer-endometrial stromal sarcoma-that occurred shortly after transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor to a patient who had undergone cancer treatment 7 years earlier. The dramatic course of the disease, complicated with recurrent massive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and the right cardiac cavities, as well as pulmonary embolism and serious infectious complications, illustrates the difficulties related to qualifying patients with a history of malignancy for transplantation.\nBased on this case report, we attempt to find an answer to the question about the risk of cancer recurrence in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy and find out how it can be minimized. Answering these questions is particularly important if the recurrent cancer is substantially more aggressive, cancer treatment options are limited, and the prognosis is poor due to lack of immunocompetence.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2014-11-09", "authors": ["RWieczorek-Godlewska", "DMiszewska-Szyszkowska", "KSlubowska", "AOgnista-Gajda", "AChmura", "MDurlik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.09.011"}

All donors and recipients were positive but one for cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin G. All recipients received immunosuppressive therapy basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone. Until May 2013, there were four cases of severe infections requiring hospitalization. One patient developed CMV infection on the 28th postoperative day. Despite therapy with ganciclovir and prophylaxis with valganciclovir, reinfection episodes occurred both 4 weeks and 7 months later. The female recipient developed CMV infection 8 months after hand transplantation. After 3 weeks of ganciclovir treatment, the polymerase chain reaction results remained negative. We found that the CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes ratio differs in those two patients who had developed CMV disease in the past in comparison to the three remaining hand transplant recipients (mean 0.46 versus 1.7, respectively). Moreover, the ratio of patients who were CD4-8 negative to total T lymphocytes in CMV recovered patients was two-fold higher compared to the remaining recipients (10.0 versus 4.4, respectively). The female recipient was also hospitalized because of acute tonsillitis 25 months after hand transplantation, and successfully treated with amoxicillin clavulanate. The third recipient was hospitalized because of severe acute pain involving right lower limb, especially foot, 74 months after hand transplantation. After 48 hours, a painful vesicular rash occurred on the plantar as well as dorsal surface of right foot and herpes zoster was diagnosed.

Here, we studied the effect of implant volume and cell densities on the in vivo vascularization of modular engineered tissue constructs. Sub-millimeter collagen modules containing adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSC) and enveloped by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were subcutaneously implanted in severe-combined immunodeficient mice with a beige-mutation (SCID-bg) mice. Implant volume and cell density was varied relative to a base case, defined as a 0.01\u2009mL implant containing 1.5\u00d710(7) adMSC/mL and 3.9\u00d710(6) HUVEC/mL. At 7 and 14 days post-transplantation, the constructs were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of total (CD31(+)) and graft-derived (UEA1(+)) vessel formation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1\u03b1) expression, infiltration of host-derived leukocytes (CD45), and macrophages (F4/80). Implant volume and cell density affected the relative contributions of host- versus graft-derived vascularization, highlighting that different mechanisms underlie the two processes. Graft-derived vessel formation was most rapid and robust in implants with high HIF1\u03b1 expression, namely large volume implants and implants with high adMSC and HUVEC density (p<0.01 compared to base case at day 7). Many HIF1\u03b1(+) cells were vessel-lining HUVEC, suggesting that HIF1 activation may be key to vessel assembly in the graft. Host vessel ingrowth, however, dominated the vascularization of small volume implants (of high and low adMSC density alike), which showed low HIF1\u03b1 expression at day 7. Host vessels were sustained to day 14 when adMSC density alone was increased, presumably due to increased paracrine secretions. This study points to a potential role of HIF1 activation in the vascularization of tissue constructs, which may be harnessed to engineer robust vessels for therapeutic applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The use of corpus spongiosum alone to cover the neourethra is infrequent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of spongioplasty alone as an intervening layer in the prevention of urethral fistula following tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU).\nA prospective study was performed including 113 primary hypospadias cases undergoing TIPU with spongioplasty from June 2010 to March 2012. Correction of chordee was carried out by penile degloving alone in 5, mobilization of urethral plate with spongiosum in 22 and combination of both in 45 cases. Intra-operatively, spongiosum was taken to be poorly developed if it was thin and fibrous, moderate if good spongiosal tissue with good vascularization and well-developed if healthy robust spongiosum, which became bulkier than native spongiosum after tubularisation. Spongioplasty was done in a single layer after mobilization of spongiosum, starting just proximal to the native meatus and into the glans distally.\nThe mean age of the patients was 11.53 years. The type of hypospadias was distal, mid and proximal in 81, 12 and 20 cases respectively. Spongiosum was poorly developed in 13, moderate in 53 and well-developed in 47 cases. The mean hospital stay was 8-10 days and follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Urethral fistula was seen in six patients (11.3%) with moderate spongiosum (distal 1, mid 1 and proximal 4), and three (23.03%) with poorly developed spongiosum (one each in distal, mid and proximal) with an overall 7.96% fistula rate. None of the patients with well-developed spongiosum developed a fistula. Poorer spongiosum correlated with a greater number of complications (P = 0.011). Five out of thirteen cases with poor spongiosum (38.46%) had proximal hypospadias, i.e. more proximal was the hypospadias, poorer was the development of the spongiosum (P = 0.05). Meatal stenosis was seen in two patients (1.76%) with proximal hypospadias, one with moderate and the other with poorly developed spongiosum. More proximal was the hypospadias, greater were the number of complications (P = 0.0019).\nTIPU with spongioplasty reconstructs a near normal urethra with low complications. Better developed and thicker spongiosum results in lower incidence of fistula and meatal stenosis. More proximal hypospadias is associated with poorer spongiosum.

These injuries are commonly associated with missing teeth, for which replacement is compromised due to inadequate jawbone support. Using cell therapy, we report the upper jaw reconstruction of a patient who lost teeth and 75% of the supporting jawbone following injury. A mixed population of bone marrow-derived autologous stem and progenitor cells was seeded onto \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP), which served as a scaffold to deliver cells directly to the defect.

Four months after cell therapy, cone beam computed tomography and a bone biopsy were performed, and oral implants were placed to support an engineered dental prosthesis. Cell seeding efficiency (>81%) of the \u03b2-TCP and survival during the seeding process (94%) were highest when cells were incubated with \u03b2-TCP for 30 minutes, regardless of incubation temperature; however, at 1 hour, cell survival was highest when incubated at 4\u00b0C.

Adipose Phd2 gene ablation in mice enhanced adiposity, with a parallel increase in adipose vascularization associated with reduced circulating nonesterified fatty acid levels and normal glucose homeostasis. Phd2 gene-depleted adipocytes exhibited lower basal lipolysis in normoxia and reduced \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis in both normoxia and hypoxia.

{"title": "Endothelin A receptor/\u03b2-arrestin signaling to the Wnt pathway renders ovarian cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy.", "abstract": "The high mortality of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is mainly caused by resistance to the available therapies. In EOC, the endothelin-1 (ET-1, EDN1)-endothelin A receptor (ETAR, EDNRA) signaling axis regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a chemoresistant phenotype. However, there is a paucity of knowledge about how ET-1 mediates drug resistance. Here, we define a novel bypass mechanism through which ETAR/\u03b2-arrestin-1 (\u03b2-arr1, ARRB1) links Wnt signaling to acquire chemoresistant and EMT phenotype. We found that ETAR/\u03b2-arr1 activity promoted nuclear complex with \u03b2-catenin and p300, resulting in histone acetylation, chromatin reorganization, and enhanced transcription of genes, such as ET-1, enhancing the network that sustains chemoresistance. Silencing of \u03b2-arr1 or pharmacologic treatment with the dual ETAR/ETBR antagonist macitentan prevented core complex formation and restored drug sensitivity, impairing the signaling pathways involved in cell survival, EMT, and invasion. In vivo macitentan treatment reduced tumor growth, vascularization, intravasation, and metastatic progression. The combination of macitentan and cisplatinum resulted in the potentiation of the cytotoxic effect, indicating that macitentan can enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy. Investigations in clinical specimens of chemoresistant EOC tissues confirmed increased recruitment of \u03b2-arr1 and \u03b2-catenin to ET-1 gene promoter. In these tissues, high expression of ETAR significantly associated with poor clinical outcome and chemoresistance. Collectively, our findings reveal the existence of a novel mechanism by which ETAR/\u03b2-arr1 signaling is integrated with the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway to sustain chemoresistance in EOC, and they offer a solid rationale for clinical evaluation of macitentan in combination with chemotherapy to overcome chemoresistance in this setting.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2014-11-08", "authors": ["LauraRosan\u00f2", "RobertaCianfrocca", "PieraTocci", "FrancescaSpinella", "ValerianaDi Castro", "ValentinaCaprara", "ElisaSemprucci", "GabriellaFerrandina", "Pier GiorgioNatali", "AnnaBagnato"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3133"}

In this work, we use an integrative in vivo-in silico approach to investigate the occurrence of non-unions, as well as to design possible treatment strategies thereof. The gap size of the domain geometry of a previously published mathematical model was enlarged in order to study the complex interplay of blood vessel formation, oxygen supply, growth factors and cell proliferation on the final healing outcome in large bone defects. The multiscale oxygen model was not only able to capture the essential aspects of in vivo non-unions, it also assisted in understanding the underlying mechanisms of action, i.e., the delayed vascularization of the central callus region resulted in harsh hypoxic conditions, cell death and finally disrupted bone healing. Inspired by the importance of a timely vascularization, as well as by the limited biological potential of the fracture hematoma, the influence of the host environment on the bone healing process in critical size defects was explored further. Moreover, dependent on the host environment, several treatment strategies were designed and tested for effectiveness. A qualitative correspondence between the predicted outcomes of certain treatment strategies and experimental observations was obtained, clearly illustrating the model's potential. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that due to the complex non-linear dynamics of blood vessel formation, oxygen supply, growth factor production and cell proliferation and the interactions thereof with the host environment, an integrative in silico-in vivo approach is a crucial tool to further unravel the occurrence and treatments of challenging critical sized bone defects.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2014-11-07", "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lieCarlier", "Nickvan Gastel", "LiesbetGeris", "GeertCarmeliet", "HansVan Oosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003888"}
{"title": "Vascular endothelium as a target of immune response in renal transplant rejection.", "abstract": "This review of clinical and experimental studies aims at analyzing the interplay between graft endothelium and host immune system in renal transplantation, and how it affects the survival of the graft. Graft endothelium is indeed the first barrier between self and non-self that is encountered by host lymphocytes upon reperfusion of vascularized solid transplants. Endothelial cells (EC) express all the major sets of antigens (Ag) that elicit host immune response, and therefore represent a preferential target in organ rejection. Some of the Ag expressed by EC are target of the antibody-mediated response, such as the AB0 blood group system, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), and MHC class I related chain A antigens (MICA) systems, and the endothelial cell-restricted Ag; for each of these systems, the mechanisms of interaction and damage of both preformed and de novo donor-specific antibodies are reviewed along with their impact on renal graft survival. Moreover, the rejection process can force injured EC to expose cryptic self-Ag, toward which an autoimmune response mounts, overlapping to the allo-immune response in the damaging of the graft. Not only are EC a passive target of the host immune response but also an active player in lymphocyte activation; therefore, their interaction with allogenic T-cells is analyzed on the basis of experimental in vitro and in vivo studies, according to the patterns of expression of the HLA class I and II and the co-stimulatory molecules specific for cytotoxic and helper T-cells. Finally, as the response that follows transplantation has proven to be not necessarily destructive, the factors that foster graft endothelium functioning in spite of rejection, and how they could be therapeutically harnessed to promote long-term graft acceptance, are described: accommodation that is resistance of EC to donor-specific antibodies, and endothelial cell ability to induce Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells, that are crucial mediators of tolerance.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2014-11-07", "authors": ["GiovanniPiotti", "AlessandraPalmisano", "UmbertoMaggiore", "CarloBuzio"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2014.00505\n10.1056/NEJMon043418\n10.1038/nri1702\n10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283342684\n10.1038/nri2171\n10.1097/01.tp.0000231348.55262.5a\n10.1007/s000180050226\n10.1034/j.1600-6143.2003.00135.x\n10.1046/j.1365-3148.2001.00313.x\n10.1309/8W4X9H6F8FTLCGYX\n10.1097/00007890-199801270-00020\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02934.x\n10.1097/00007890-198101000-00002\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03464.x\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31819f2024\n10.1016/j.humimm.2014.02.024\n10.1136/bmj.1.5646.758\n10.1056/NEJMoa1012376\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03840.x\n10.1097/00007890-200210270-00025\n10.1056/NEJMoa1302506\n10.1111/ajt.12590\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.1991.tb02954.x\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.00495.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66458-6\n10.1097/00007890-200207270-00019\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.01016.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01644.x\n10.1056/NEJMoa067160\n10.1016/j.humimm.2011.05.004\n10.1111/j.1399-3046.2010.01407.x\n10.1093/ndt/gfp526\n10.1016/S0966-3274(97)80016-0\n10.1016/S0966-3274(98)80024-5\n10.1034/j.1600-6143.2003.00021.x\n10.1097/01.TP.0000163290.19788.E7\n10.1034/j.1399-0012.2000.140505.x\n10.1016/S0022-1759(01)00309-X\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181949d4e\n10.1111/j.1399-0039.2009.01439.x\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31821b60e9\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31823ec0ec\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.03.059\n10.2215/CJN.04451007\n10.1681/ASN.2011060596\n10.1681/ASN.2010111183\n10.1152/ajprenal.00250.2011\n10.1073/pnas.0900563106\n10.1016/j.healun.2011.01.708\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.08.009\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181fa9480\n10.1056/NEJMoa035717\n10.1172/JCI4106\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181fd97f1\n10.1016/j.humimm.2013.06.006\n10.1097/01.TP.0000129068.03900.25\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.12.043\n10.1189/jlb.0607339\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181dfa694\n10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283402cf4\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02819.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2010.03103.x\n10.1073/pnas.0602035104\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029472\n10.1126/scisignal.2001158\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.4.2357\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31823f468c\n10.1034/j.1600-6143.2001.001003260.x\n10.1002/eji.200324843\n10.1097/01.tp.0000231447.34240.3c\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.4.2214\n10.1097/00007890-199602150-00001\n10.4049/jimmunol.169.11.6154\n10.1038/nm0302-233\n10.1016/0008-8749(91)90065-J\n10.1016/0966-3274(94)90013-2\n10.1073/pnas.1011811108\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03971.x\n10.1084/jem.20110767\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2007.01960.x\n10.1172/JCI66204\n10.4049/jimmunol.175.10.6265\n10.1084/jem.20131125\n10.4049/jimmunol.1003947\n10.1111/ajt.12460"}
{"title": "Hand transplants and the mandate for tolerance.", "abstract": "The field of vascularized composite allograft (VCA) to achieve its full potential will require induction of tolerance. This review will introduce a new method of potential inducing tolerance in hand transplantation.\nHand transplantation is never a life-extending transplant. This fact resulted in considerable debate both for and against the use of immunosuppression for nonlife-extending transplants. There is considerable debate about the ethics of hand transplantation. There is now consensus that nonlife-extending transplants are acceptable in properly selected patients. However, ideally, hand transplants should not receive life-long immunosuppression. Therefore, attempts to achieve drug-free tolerance through nonlife-endangering therapies are warranted. To this end, we propose implementation of tolerizing therapy long after periinflammation has subsided and drug minimization has proven successful. Evidence that short-term treatment with low doses of IL-2 or a long-lived IL-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) can tilt the balance of immunity from tissue destructive to tolerance come from preclinical demonstrations in mouse and nonhuman primate models of autoimmunity and/or transplantation and even more recent clinical trials.\nWe believe that with the proper use of low-dose IL-2 given at an opportune time in the inflammatory process of transplant that reduce immunosuppression and even tolerance can be induced in hand transplantation. We propose that tolerance can be inducted after a long period of conventional treatment to avoid 'tolerance-hindering' adverse inflammation that occurs in the posttransplant period. With abatement of posttransplant inflammation and with time, we will institute low-dose IL-2-based therapy to support the proliferation, viability and functional phenotype of regulatory T cells.", "journal": "Current opinion in organ transplantation", "date": "2014-11-07", "authors": ["MariaKoulmanda", "BohdanPomahac", "ZhigangFan", "George FMurphy", "Terry BStrom"], "doi": "10.1097/MOT.0000000000000138"}

Human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) and periosteal-derived stem cells (hPCs) are the commonly used cellular sources for bone tissue engineering and are essential in fracture healing. In the present study, hBMSCs and hPCs were co-cultured from the same donors, as the cellular source. In monolayer cultivation, co-culturing hBMSCs and hPCs demonstrated more robust mineralized nodule formation and stronger alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive staining than hBMSCs or hPCs. Three-dimensional (3-D) culturing on porous \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds and co-culturing of hBMSCs and hPCs significantly promoted the osteogenic specific mRNA expression of COL1\u03b11, BMP-2, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC). For in\u00a0vivo bone formation and neovascularization assessment, the cellular-\u03b2-TCP scaffolds were transplanted into critical-sized femoral condyle defects in rabbits.

The extension of the superficial microvascular structure and activated pro-angiogenic mediators in psoriasis seem to be important factors involved in the pathology. According to the changes of superficial microvasculature in psoriatic lesions, anti-angiogenic treatment could be a promising therapeutic strategy for psoriasis. The aim of this study was to construct an in vitro vascularized psoriatic skin substitute for fundamental research. Psoriatic fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from psoriatic plaque biopsies, while healthy fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as microvascular endothelial cells, were isolated from healthy skin biopsies of cosmetic breast surgery. Psoriatic and healthy skin substitutes with and without endothelial cells were produced using the self-assembly approach. Afterward the substitutes were examined by histology, immunofluorescence studies, and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy. Histological analysis and immunofluorescence staining of specific markers for endothelial cells (von Willebrand, PECAM-1 [CD31], and VE-cadherin [CD144]) and basement membrane component (collagen IV) demonstrated that endothelial cells have the ability to form capillary-like tubes. Moreover, the 3D branched structure of the capillary-like structures and an eagle eye view of them were observed by confocal microscopy. Also the semiquantification of capillary-like tubes (CLTs) was carried out with a 3D eagle eye view of substitutes, and more CLTs were observed in psoriatic substitutes. These results suggest that it is possible to observe 3D capillary-like structures in the self-assembled psoriatic skin substitutes, which could become a good in vitro testing model for anti-angiogenic drug research, and facilitate the study of this complex pathology, which links angiogenesis to its development.", "journal": "BioResearch open access", "date": "2014-11-06", "authors": ["Raif ErenAyata", "SaraBouhout", "Mich\u00e8leAuger", "RoxanePouliot"], "doi": "10.1089/biores.2014.0022"}

Recently, we synthesized an aliphatic polyurethane (PU) scaffold via a foaming method using non-toxic components. Through this procedure a uniform interconnected porous structure was created. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite (HA) particles were introduced into this process to increase the bioactivity of the PU matrix. To evaluate the biological performances of these PU-based scaffolds, their influence on in vitro cellular behavior and in vivo bone forming capacity of the engineered cell-scaffold constructs was investigated in this study. A simulated body fluid test demonstrated that the incorporation of 40 wt % HA particles significantly promoted the biomineralization ability of the PU scaffolds. Enhanced in vitro proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the seeded mesenchymal stem cells were also observed on the PU/HA composite. Next, the cell-scaffold constructs were implanted subcutaneously in a nude mice model. After 8 weeks, a considerable amount of vascularized bone tissue with initial marrow stroma development was generated in both PU and PU/HA40 scaffold.

The external iliac artery emits the deep iliac circumflex artery, the pudendal epigastric trunk, the deep femoral artery; the femoral artery originates the saphenous artery, it bifurcates into cranial and caudal saphenous arteries. Immediately after the knee joint, the femoral artery is called popliteal artery, which divides into tibial cranial and tibial caudal arteries at the level of the crural inter-osseous space.

In the present study, we have extended our previous observations to investigate whether preculturing islets with MSCs can also be used to enhance islet function at the clinically used intraportal site. We have used MSCs derived from adipose tissue, which are more readily accessible than alternative sources in human subjects and can be expanded to clinically efficacious numbers, to preculture islets throughout this study. The in vivo efficacy of grafts consisting of islets precultured alone or with MSCs was tested using a syngeneic streptozotocin-diabetic minimal islet mass model at the clinically relevant intraportal site. Blood glucose concentrations were monitored for 1 month. The vascularization of islets precultured alone or with MSCs was investigated both in vitro and in vivo, using immunohistochemistry. Islet insulin content was measured by radioimmunoassay. The effect of preculturing islets with MSCs on islet function in vitro was investigated using static incubation assays. There was no beneficial angiogenic influence of MSC preculture, as demonstrated by the comparable vascularization of islets precultured alone or with MSCs, both in vitro after 3 days and in vivo 1 month after islet transplantation. However, the in vitro insulin secretory capacity of MSC precultured islets was superior to that of islets precultured alone. In vivo, this was associated with improved glycemia at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days posttransplantation, in recipients of MSC precultured islets compared to islets precultured alone. The area of individual islets within the graft-bearing liver was significantly higher in recipients of MSC precultured islets compared to islets precultured alone.

Larger defects of the skull base often require more extensive surgery, including transfer of local or distal vascularized flaps. The current article presents a stepwise tutorial for reconstruction of the skull base and by a large case series focuses on the interdisciplinary therapy of complex (size, recurrence, after radiotherapy) skull base defects.\nComplex defects with small diameter, which can occur after extended sinus surgery, were permanently closed by local mucosa flaps of the lower turbinate or of the septum (n=31). Larger defects, e.\u2009g. after combined transcranial and endonasal tumor surgery, were closed by a 'sandwich technique' containing a galea periost flap and a calvarian split transfer (n=10). Reconstruction of the dura with fascia lata and local transfer of the temporal muscle were efficient for frontobasal defects with a more lateral location (n=4). Transfer of a distal desepithelialised vascularized forearm flap represents the ultimate procedure for reconstruction of large skull base defects, which was performed in 4 of our patients.\nSuccessive escalation of the therapy and integra-tion of the entire repertoire of plastic-reconstructive surgery allows for durable closure of complex skull base defects.

Patients A total of 452 subjects were enrolled and followed-up for a mean 5.8 years after being grouped according to the ABI (<0.9 vs. \u22650.9) and baPWV (<1,700 cm/s vs. \u22651,700 cm/s).\nThe outcomes were all-cause mortality and composite events (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for coronary artery disease, stroke, re-vascularization, amputation and diabetic foot). Inter-group differences in the smoking rate, duration of diabetes, systolic and pulse blood pressure, anti-platelet drugs, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urine albumin excretion were significant. During the follow-up period, 17 (3.7%) individuals died and composite events were recorded in 64 cases (14.1%). A low ABI plus high baPWV was found be associated with poor outcomes compared with a normal ABI plus low baPWV (p<0.001).

The patient presented with decreased visual acuity (20/50) and severe pain in her right eye. Examination revealed a 3.5 \u00d7 4.5 mm white-colored deep stromal infiltration located on the temporal corneal tunnel incision. Corneal scraping samples were obtained for cytological and culture examinations. The cinnamon-brown colonies consisting of a dense felt of conidiophores were identified as A. terreus using molecular data. Using CLSI M38-A2 microdilution method, minimum inhibitory concentration values of amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole were determined to be 2, 1, 0.25, and 1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, and minimum effective concentration values of caspofungin and anidulafungin were \u22640.03 and \u22640.03, respectively, at 48 h for the A. terreus strain. Antifungal therapy was started as topical 1 % voriconazole drops hourly and 5 % natamycin ointment five times a day; however, corneal infection and melting progressed despite the ongoing intensive treatment and visual acuity dropped to the 20/200 level at the end of the first week. Amniotic membrane transplantation was performed to promote corneal healing. Topical medication was tapered and discontinued within 2 months based on the clinical features. The ulcer healed with scarring and vascularization, and visual acuity improved to 20/50.

Vascular insufficiency in PAD occurs despite higher circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a key regulator of angiogenesis. Here we show that clinical PAD is associated with elevated levels of an antiangiogenic VEGF-A splice isoform (VEGF-A165b) and a corresponding reduction in levels of the proangiogenic VEGF-A165a splice isoform. In mice, VEGF-A165b expression was upregulated by conditions associated with impaired limb revascularization, including leptin deficiency, diet-induced obesity, genetic ablation of the secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) adipokine and transgenic overexpression of Wnt5a in myeloid cells. In a mouse model of PAD, delivery of VEGF-A165b inhibited revascularization of ischemic hind limbs, whereas treatment with an isoform-specific neutralizing antibody reversed impaired revascularization caused by metabolic dysfunction or perturbations in the Wnt5a-Sfrp5 regulatory system.

{"title": "Gellan gum-hyaluronic acid spongy-like hydrogels and cells from adipose tissue synergize promoting neoskin vascularization.", "abstract": "Currently available substitutes for skin wound healing often result in the formation of nonfunctional neotissue. Thus, urgent care is still needed to promote an effective and complete regeneration. To meet this need, we proposed the assembling of a construct that takes advantage of cell-adhesive gellan gum-hyaluronic acid (GG-HA) spongy-like hydrogels and a powerful cell-machinery obtained from adipose tissue, human adipose stem cells (hASCs), and microvascular endothelial cells (hAMECs). In addition to a cell-adhesive character, GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels overpass limitations of traditional hydrogels, such as reduced physical stability and limited manipulation, due to improved microstructural arrangement characterized by pore wall thickening and increased mean pore size. The proposed constructs combining cellular mediators of the healing process within the spongy-like hydrogels that intend to recapitulate skin matrix aim to promote neoskin vascularization. Stable and off-the-shelf dried GG-HA polymeric networks, rapidly rehydrated at the time of cell seeding then depicting features of both sponges and hydrogels, enabled the natural cell entrapment/encapsulation and attachment supported by cell-polymer interactions. Upon transplantation into mice full-thickness excisional wounds, GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels absorbed the early inflammatory cell infiltrate and led to the formation of a dense granulation tissue. Consequently, spongy-like hydrogel degradation was observed, and progressive wound closure, re-epithelialization, and matrix remodelling was improved in relation to the control condition. More importantly, GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels promoted a superior neovascularization, which was enhanced in the presence of human hAMECs, also found in the formed neovessels. These observations highlight the successful integration of a valuable matrix and prevascularization cues to target angiogenesis/neovascularization in skin full-thickness excisional wounds.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2014-11-02", "authors": ["Mariana TeixeiraCerqueira", "Luc\u00edlia Pereirada Silva", "T\u00edrcia CarlosSantos", "Rog\u00e9rio PedroPirraco", "V\u00edtor ManuelCorrelo", "Rui Lu\u00edsReis", "Alexandra PintoMarques"], "doi": "10.1021/am504520j"}
{"title": "The Masquelet procedure gone awry.", "abstract": "The Masquelet technique was first performed in 1986. It is a 2-stage procedure for healing of substantial bone defects, with or without the presence of infection. In the former situation, a thorough debridement of the infected site is necessary to achieve a clean cavity. A cement block is fashioned to fit into the entire defect to act as a spacer that maintains the space for grafting and reconstruction and induces a synovial-like membrane. The induced membrane avoids resorption of the bone graft and secretes growth factors, including vascular and osteoinductive factors, to promote revascularization of the graft. The membrane has an inner part that is a synovial-like epithelium and an outer part composed of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and collagen. It is richly vascularized. After a period of 6 to 8 weeks, the spacer is removed by incising the induced membrane that has formed. Copious bone graft, usually autologous and obtained from the iliac crest or by other means, is placed into the defect that is now lined by the induced membrane. The membrane is closed over the graft. This article describes a young patient who started on the correct path for a Masquelet procedure only to have it turn in the wrong direction.

The BBB status of cortex microvessels was examined at a defined stage of cortex development, at the end of neuroblast waves of migration, and before cortex lamination, with BBB-endothelial cell markers, namely tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and claudin-5) and influx and efflux transporters (Glut-1 and P-glycoprotein), the latter supporting evidence for functional effectiveness of the fetal BBB. According to the well-known roles of astroglia cells on microvessel growth and differentiation, the early composition of astroglia/endothelial cell relationships was analyzed by detecting the appropriate astroglia, endothelial, and pericyte markers. GFAP, chemokine CXCL12, and connexin 43 (Cx43) were utilized as markers of radial glia cells, CD105 (endoglin) as a marker of angiogenically activated endothelial cells (ECs), and proteoglycan NG2 as a marker of immature pericytes. Immunolabeling for CXCL12 showed the highest level of the ligand in radial glial (RG) fibers in contact with the growing cortex microvessels. These specialized contacts, recognizable on both perforating radial vessels and growing collaterals, appeared as CXCL12-reactive en passant, symmetrical and asymmetrical, vessel-specific RG fiber swellings. At the highest confocal resolution, these RG varicosities showed a CXCL12-reactive dot-like content whose microvesicular nature was confirmed by ultrastructural observations.

We aimed to evaluate the stability of the distal femoral defect after reconstruction with fibular grafts of different lengths.

The Von Mises stress distributions were similar between the 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm bone grafts and locking plate within each of those bone defect models (P > 0.05), while the Von Mises stress distribution was significantly higher in the 12 cm model than the other 3 lengths for both the bone graft and locking plate (P < 0.05). Significantly greater Von Mises stress was observed at the 12 cm bone graft and locking plate than with the shorter bone grafts. Therefore, we recommend that, to avoid complications, the bone graft should not exceed 12 cm when using FVFG in combination with a locking plate while treating a distal femoral tumor defect.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2014-10-31", "authors": ["LiminMa", "YeZhou", "YuZhang", "XiaZhou", "ZilongYao", "WenhanHuang", "GuoqingQiao", "HongXia"], "doi": null}

The underlying mechanism remains far from clear. Here we provide strong evidence that the activation of TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling in PDAC cells increased SMAD3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to inhibit cell growth. Meanwhile, it also activated SMAD7 to induce nuclear translocation and retention of \u03b2-catenin, which not only attenuated the inhibition of cell growth by nuclear SMAD3 but also activated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) to promote vascularization. Our data thus support a model involving crosstalk of the TGF\u03b2 and Wnt signaling pathways, for regulating the complicated effect of TGF\u03b2 signaling on the tumorigenesis of PDAC.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2014-10-31", "authors": ["HuiZhang", "ChengliLiu", "YalinKong", "HuiHuang", "ChengWang", "HongyiZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-014-2757-4"}
{"title": "The antiparasitic drug, potassium antimony tartrate, inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in nonsmall-cell lung cancer.", "abstract": "Repurposing existing drugs not only accelerates drug discovery but rapidly advances clinical therapeutic strategies. In this article, we identified potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT), an antiparasitic drug, as a novel agent to block angiogenesis by screening US Food and Drug Administration-approved chemical drugs. By comparing the cytotoxicity of PAT in various nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with that observed in primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we found that HUVECs were much more sensitive to the PAT treatment. In in vivo tumor xenograft mouse models established either by PAT-resistant A549 cells or by patient primary tumors, PAT significantly decreased the tumor volume and tumor weight of NSCLC xenografts at dosage of 40 mg/kg (i.p., daily) and, more importantly, augmented the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy. Remarkable loss of vascularization in the treated xenografts indicated the in vivo antiangiogenesis property of PAT, which was well correlated with its tumor growth inhibition in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, in the in vitro angiogenic assays, PAT exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to different stimuli. Consistently, PAT also abolished the vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the Matrigel plugs assay. Mechanistically, we found that PAT inhibited the activities of several receptor tyrosine kinases and specifically blocked the activation of downstream Src and focal adhesion kinases in HUVECs. Taken together, our results characterized the novel antiangiogenic and antitumor function of PAT in NSCLC cells. Further study of PAT in anticancer clinical trials may be warranted.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2014-10-30", "authors": ["BeibeiWang", "WeiweiYu", "JiaweiGuo", "XingwuJiang", "WeiqiangLu", "MingyaoLiu", "XiufengPang"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.114.218644"}
{"title": "Blood vessels in ganglia in human esophagus might explain the higher frequency of megaesophagus compared with megacolon.", "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the existence of blood vessels within ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the human esophagus and colon. At necropsy, 15 stillborns, newborns and children up to two years of age, with no gastrointestinal disorders, were examined. Rings of the esophagus and colon were analyzed and then fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin. Histological sections were stained by hematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa and immunohistochemistry for the characterization of endothelial cells, using antibodies for anti-factor VIII and CD31. Blood vessels were identified within the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the esophagus, and no blood vessels were found in any ganglia of the colon. It was concluded that the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the esophagus are vascularized, while the ganglia of the colon are avascular. Vascularization within the esophageal ganglia could facilitate the entrance of infectious agents, as well as the development of inflammatory responses (ganglionitis) and denervation, as found in Chagas disease and idiopathic achalasia. This could explain the higher frequency of megaesophagus compared with megacolon.\nEste estudo teve como objetivo avaliar se existem ou n\u00e3o vasos sangu\u00edneos no interior de g\u00e2nglios do plexo mient\u00e9rico do es\u00f4fago e c\u00f3lon humano.

As the retina and the brain share similar embryological origin, anatomical features and physiological properties with the cerebral small vessels, the retinal vessels thus offer a unique and easily accessible \"window\" to study the correlates and consequences of cerebral small vessel diseases in vivo. Retinal microvasculature can now be visualized, quantified and monitored non-invasively using state-of-the-art retinal imaging technology. Recent clinic- and population-based studies have demonstrated a link between retinal vascular changes and dementia, in particular AD, and cerebral small vessel disease. In this review, we summarize the current findings on retinal vascular changes such as retinopathy signs and changes in novel retinal vascular network parameters and retinal vascular caliber with dementia, cognitive dysfunction and cerebral small vessel disease, and discuss possible future research to further evaluate whether retinal vascular imaging might help to elucidate vascular mechanisms contributing to the development of AD and provide additional value in predicting who may be at risk of developing AD.", "journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "date": "2014-10-30", "authors": ["Carol Yim-LuiCheung", "Yi-TingOng", "M KamranIkram", "ChristopherChen", "Tien YinWong"], "doi": "10.3233/JAD-141596"}

In the resting zone the genes for extracellular matrix molecule synthesis were expressed. Extracellular matrix degrading enzymes and their inhibitors were also expressed here. Onset of proliferation involved cyclic upregulation of cell division-associated activity and reduced expression of extracellular matrix molecules. Later in the proliferative zone we noted transient expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with vascularization and apoptosis. With the onset of hypertrophy expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with vascularization and apoptosis were significantly upregulated. Terminal differentiation was characterized by high expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with apoptosis.

The auditory midbrain (or inferior colliculus, IC) is an ideal place to study sound-induced vascular changes because it is the brain's most vascularized structure and it is tonotopically organized. However, its micro-vascular pattern remains poorly understood. Since the IC is a sphere-like structure, the histological assessment of vasculature could depend on the angle of sectioning. Here, we studied the effects of cutting the IC at different angles on microvascular assessment, specifically: micro-vascular density and the shape of microvascular lumen. Photomicrographs were taken from 5 \u00b5m toluidine blue-stained histological sections obtained at two angles of sectioning: (a) the conventional coronal sectioning, and (b) a novel \"tangential\" sectioning (tangential to the dorso-medial surface of the IC). Results showed that the tangential sections, in comparison with the coronal sections, yielded (a) a higher count of micro-vascular density and (b) a higher proportion of round-shaped micro-vascular lumens. This discrepancy in results between two cut angles is likely related to the spatial pattern of blood vessels supplying the IC. We propose that the tangential sectioning should be adopted as standard for the accurate study of microvasculature in the IC.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2014-10-29", "authors": ["Edmund CheungSo", "Hui-PinLu", "Chung HsiHsing", "Sheng NanWu", "Yu-KaiChang", "Paul W FPoon"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22450"}
{"title": "Biological strategies for improved osseointegration and osteoinduction of porous metal orthopedic implants.", "abstract": "The biological interface between an orthopedic implant and the surrounding host tissue may have a dramatic effect upon clinical outcome. Desired effects include bony ingrowth (osseointegration), stimulation of osteogenesis (osteoinduction), increased vascularization, and improved mechanical stability. Implant loosening, fibrous encapsulation, corrosion, infection, and inflammation, as well as physical mismatch may have deleterious clinical effects. This is particularly true of implants used in the reconstruction of load-bearing synovial joints such as the knee, hip, and the shoulder. The surfaces of orthopedic implants have evolved from solid-smooth to roughened-coarse and most recently, to porous in an effort to create a three-dimensional architecture for bone apposition and osseointegration. Total joint surgeries are increasingly performed in younger individuals with a longer life expectancy, and therefore, the postimplantation lifespan of devices must increase commensurately. This review discusses advancements in biomaterials science and cell-based therapies that may further improve orthopedic success rates. We focus on material and biological properties of orthopedic implants fabricated from porous metal and highlight some relevant developments in stem-cell research. We posit that the ideal primary and revision orthopedic load-bearing metal implants are highly porous and may be chemically modified to induce stem cell growth and osteogenic differentiation, while minimizing inflammation and infection. We conclude that integration of new biological, chemical, and mechanical methods is likely to yield more effective strategies to control and modify the implant-bone interface and thereby improve long-term clinical outcomes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "ER\u03b2 decreases breast cancer cell survival by regulating the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway.", "abstract": "Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive reaction that allows cancer cells to survive endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress that is often induced in the tumor microenvironment because of inadequate vascularization. Previous studies report an association between activation of the UPR and reduced sensitivity to antiestrogens and chemotherapeutics in estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. ER\u03b1 has been shown to regulate the expression of a key mediator of the EnR stress response, the X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Although network prediction models have associated ER\u03b2 with the EnR stress response, its role as regulator of the UPR has not been experimentally tested. Here, upregulation of wild-type ER\u03b2 (ER\u03b21) or treatment with ER\u03b2 agonists enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells in the presence of pharmacological inducers of EnR stress. Targeting the BCL-2 to the EnR of the ER\u03b21-expressing cells prevented the apoptosis induced by EnR stress but not by non-EnR stress apoptotic stimuli indicating that ER\u03b21 promotes EnR stress-regulated apoptosis. Downregulation of inositol-requiring kinase 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) and decreased splicing of XBP-1 were associated with the decreased survival of the EnR-stressed ER\u03b21-expressing cells. ER\u03b21 was found to repress the IRE1 pathway of the UPR by inducing degradation of IRE1\u03b1.

With externally labeled plasma, the vascular network including single capillaries can be well visualized. We compare the vascular images of in vivo mouse brain acquired by both OMAG and MPM systems. We found that within the penetration depth range of the MPM system, OMAG is able to accurately visualize blood vessels including capillaries. Although the resolution of OMAG may not be able to 100% resolve two closely packed tiny capillaries in tissue, it is still capable of visualizing most of the capillaries because there are interstitial tissue spaces between them.

Since fibroblasts activation and migration is required for physiological events relying on angiogenesis, we hypothesize herein that different fibroblasts exhibit distinct capacity to promote capillary-like structures assembly, by mature and progenitor endothelial cells (ECs). Outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) were isolated from human umbilical cord blood samples and characterized by immunofluorescence and imaging flow cytometry for endothelial markers. Coculture systems were established using either human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) or OECs with fibroblasts, being evaluated at 7, 14, and 21 days of culture. Two types of human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were used, namely neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts-1 (HFF-1) and juvenile HDF. OECs expressed EC markers and formed capillary-like structures. HFF-1 exhibited higher expression of transglutaminase-2, while HDF exhibited a higher expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and podoplanin, which were not observed for HFF-1. Formation of capillary-like structures was only observed in cocultures with HDF and not with HFF-1. No significant differences were found between HDF and OECs or HUVECs cocultures. These findings suggest that HDF is a preferential cell source for promoting vascularization, either using mature or progenitor ECs, probably due to their higher expression of \u03b1-SMA and podoplanin, and increased synthesis of extracellular matrix.

Although rare, injury to neurovascular structures may occur, and the proximity of the vascular structures to the osteotomy saw cuts has been incompletely characterized.\nWe performed a cadaver study to assess the risk of vascular injury in patients undergoing realignment osteotomies by (1) quantifying the distances between osteotomy saw cuts and blood vessels using three-dimensional CT reconstruction after distal femoral and proximal tibial osteotomies; and (2) qualitatively describing the small- and medium-sized vasculature around the knee, to provide the link between the CT analysis and wedge incision measures, and better show the potential extraosseous supply to the regions investigated.\nTwelve human cadaveric knees were injected with a latex and barium sulfate suspension into the superficial femoral artery. Each specimen underwent CT to evaluate vascular perfusion and was randomized to either a lateral opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy and medial opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy group, or a medial closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy and lateral closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy group. Postoperatively, knees underwent CT in extension to measure the shortest distance between the osteotomies and the popliteal artery, anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and genicular arteries. Vessels between 5 mm and 10 mm from the osteotomy cut were considered in a zone of moderate risk for damage, while vessels less than 5 mm from the cut were considered in a zone of high risk for damage. Vessels more than 10 mm from the cut were not considered to be at risk. Subsequently, knees underwent dissection and chemical d\u00e9bridement to qualitatively describe the smaller vessels. This part of the study added visual information and gave a comprehensive overview of the vessels at risk.\nAll variations of the osteotomies put at least one artery at risk. The popliteal artery was found in a risk zone for injury in two specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 11.6 mm; range, 5.2-14.6 mm). The superior lateral genicular artery was in a risk zone in all the specimens during opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 3.0 mm; range, 0.7-6.5 mm), and in five specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 4.5 mm; range, 1.3-11.2 mm). A concomitant risk for superior medial genicular artery injury was observed in five specimens during opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 8.7 mm; range, 0.8-13.9 mm) and in four specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 4.1; range, 0.5-41.7 mm).

The inferior medial genicular artery could be classified at risk in five specimens during opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 2.1 mm; range, 0.3-32 mm) and in five specimens during closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 5.8 mm; range, 1.4-13 mm). Furthermore, the inferior lateral genicular artery was found in a risk zone in two specimens of closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomies (median distance, 17.4 mm; range, 8-23.3 mm). There were no differences between opening-wedge and closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomies and proximal tibial osteotomies in the vessels at risk during the procedure. After chemical d\u00e9bridement, knees showed abundant vascularization of the distal femur and lateral tibia, whereas the medial tibia contained few arteries.\nWith the numbers available, we found that none of the osteotomy techniques performed was safer than any other in terms of the proximity of the major arterial structures and some vessels appear to be at relatively high risk during these procedures.\nThis study clarifies that the genicular arteries on the opposite side of the surgical field, which cannot be seen and protected during the procedure, can be at risk of injury, particularly when the cortical hinge is compromised. Additional studies are necessary to address the potential risk of the dissection needed for plate placement and injuries related to drilling and screw placement during osteotomies around the knee.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2014-10-23", "authors": ["SalvatoreBisicchia", "FedericaRosso", "Marc APizzimenti", "ChamnanniRungprai", "Jessica EGoetz", "AnnunziatoAmendola"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-014-4007-x\n10.1148/94.3.581\n10.1007/s00167-009-0999-2\n10.1016/j.knee.2010.05.009\n10.1016/j.arthro.2012.12.002\n10.1016/j.crad.2006.03.014\n10.1007/s00167-010-1138-9\n10.1016/j.csm.2012.08.017\n10.1007/s001670050114\n10.1007/s00167-011-1709-4\n10.1002/aja.1001080303\n10.1007/s00270-008-9460-z\n10.1097/00000658-198912000-00014\n10.1177/0363546510363664\n10.1177/0363546507311595\n10.2214/ajr.150.2.435\n10.1007/s00276-008-0454-y\n10.1177/1071100713479318\n10.1007/BF01795242\n10.1002/1529-0131(199804)41:4<687::AID-ART16>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1308/003588413X13629960046831\n10.1016/0002-9610(86)90222-9\n10.1007/s10195-010-0120-0\n10.1016/S0968-0160(01)00066-7\n10.3928/01477447-20090511-29\n10.1302/0301-620X.85B2.13559\n10.1097/00003086-199910000-00019\n10.1016/j.knee.2010.10.001\n10.1024/0301-1526/a000140\n10.2106/JBJS.M.01008\n10.1097/JSA.0b013e3182900720\n10.1007/s00402-003-0545-5\n10.1007/s00167-012-2133-0\n10.2106/JBJS.C.01559\n10.1177/000331978603700211"}

Notch1, the key regulator of vasculogenesis and embryonic differentiation, has shown a correlation with a poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We attempted to elucidate the relationship between Notch1 and the vascularization of HCC.\nHCC cell lines were assayed for tube formation and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) absorption. The translation level of targets of interest was verified using western blot. Notch1 was silenced in HepG2, BEL-7402 and HCCLM6 using lentivirus shRNA. A hypoxic culture was conducted in an anaerobic culture chamber to induce VM in HepG2. Samples from 53 patients with HCC, i.e., 5 with metastasis and 48 without were tested for Notch1(+) cells and CD34 negative plus Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) positive structures, respectively.\nBEL-7402 and HCCLM6 were capable of tube formation and LDL absorption in vitro, while HepG2 was negative for both. Notch1 down-regulation suppressed endothelial marker expression and greatly impaired tube formation. After hypoxic culture, the tube formation capacity of HepG2 was significantly enhanced, along with an increase in Notch1 expression. Notch1 was strongly and profusely expressed in all 5 cases of distant metastasis, while 19 of the 48 cases without metastasis were sparsely positive (P < 0.05). Notch1 positivity was mainly seen in the cytoplasm and nuclei. VM structures were only found in 2 cases from the metastasis group (P < 0.05).\nHCC is capable of VM.

Using dynamic thermography the perforators on the abdominal skin were located. Afterwards the flap was prepared on a randomly chosen perforator.

The use of thermography has shown that basing the flap vascularization on the perforator with low efficiency resulted in statistically more frequent occurrence of ischemia and partial necrosis of the flap (p = 0.024). Partial necrosis of the flap occurred in 12 of 31 cases, always in the area in which during the preoperative thermography no perforators were found. The areas of necrosis occurred irrespectively of the distance from the supplying vessel.\nWhen designing the shape of the flap, the distribution of all perforators must be considered.

Using the quantitative in situ brain perfusion technique, we first found lower (13.0% and 17.0%) brain transport coefficient (Clup) of [(3)H]-diazepam in APOE4 mice at 4 and 12 months, compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice, reflecting a decrease in cerebral vascularization. Accordingly, results from immunohistofluorescence experiments revealed a structurally reduced cerebral vascularization (26% and 38%) and thinner basement membranes (30% and 35%) in 12-month-old APOE4 mice compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice, suggesting vascular atrophy. In addition, APOE4 mice displayed a 29% reduction in [(3)H]-d-glucose transport through the BBB compared with APOE2 mice without significant changes in the expression of its transporter GLUT1 in brain capillaries. However, an increase of 41.3% of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was found in brain capillaries of 12-month-old APOE4 mice.

However, or larger defects, free flaps have been preferred because they can provide a large area of well-vascularized soft tissue, which is suitable for defect repair. We present the case of a large abdominal wall defect, which was treated with a free combined serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, resulting in a successful outcome.\nA 38-year-old female originally had squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri, and had undergone radical hysterectomy and oophorectomy followed by radiotherapy. She had a recurrence of the cervical cancer after 13\u00a0years, and underwent pelvic exenteration. However, the mid-abdominal wound developed dehiscence and an abdominal full-thickness defect communicating with the pelvic cavity. Furthermore, the adhered colon developed necrosis, which drained stools into the pelvic cavity, resulting in chronic peritonitis. During surgery, the empty pelvic cavity was filled with a combined serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap to prevent chronic peritonitis, to create a new stoma in the skin paddle of the flap for the necrotic colon, and to separate the pelvic cavity from the drained stools. The patient could walk in the absence of abdominal hernia formation and relapse of infection.\nA combined serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap was applied to cover the raw surface and reinforce the abdominal wall and to fashion a new colostomy, as well as successfully filling the pelvic cavity with a large muscle body and long vascular pedicle.

It appears that utilization of sentinel flaps, in-depth histological analyses and application of novel biomarkers have facilitated early diagnosis and characterization of acute rejection episodes, leading to timely institution of appropriate therapy. The successful management of the first highly sensitized face transplant recipient suggests the possibility of carefully considering these high-risk VCA candidates for transplantation.\nAcute rejection is higher in VCA than in any other organ in the field of transplantation, although most episodes are controlled by high-dose steroids and optimization of maintenance immunosuppression. Because of limitations in patient number and the duration of follow-up, the long-term safety and effectiveness of VCA remain unclear.

We cocultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) within the spheroids formed by hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and studied the distributions of the HUVECs over time. We observed that the migration of HUVECs depended on the size of spheroids. In the spheroids of \u223c200\u2009\u03bcm diameters, HUVECs migrated outwards to the edges within 48 h; while in the spheroids of \u223c250\u2009\u03bcm diameters, there was no outward migration of the HUVECs up to 72 h. In addition, we studied the effects of pro-angiogenic factors, namely, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (\u03b2-FGF), on the migration of HUVECs in the carcinoma cell spheroid. The outward migration of HUVECs in 200\u2009\u03bcm spheroids was hindered by the treatment with VEGF and \u03b2-FGF.

{"title": "Effects of Tamoxifen and oestrogen on histology and radiographic density in high and low mammographic density human breast tissues maintained in murine tissue engineering chambers.", "abstract": "Mammographic density (MD) is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. It is altered by exogenous endocrine treatments, including hormone replacement therapy and Tamoxifen. Such agents also modify breast cancer (BC) risk. However, the biomolecular basis of how systemic endocrine therapy modifies MD and MD-associated BC risk is poorly understood. This study aims to determine whether our xenograft biochamber model can be used to study the effectiveness of therapies aimed at modulating MD, by examine the effects of Tamoxifen and oestrogen on histologic and radiographic changes in high and low MD tissues maintained within the biochamber model. High and low MD human tissues were precisely sampled under radiographic guidance from prophylactic mastectomy fresh specimens of high-risk women, then inserted into separate vascularized murine biochambers. The murine hosts were concurrently implanted with Tamoxifen, oestrogen or placebo pellets, and the high and low MD biochamber tissues maintained in the murine host environment for 3\u00a0months, before the high and low MD biochamber tissues were harvested for histologic and radiographic analyses. The radiographic density of high MD tissue maintained in murine biochambers was decreased in Tamoxifen-treated mice compared to oestrogen-treated mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Tamoxifen treatment of high MD tissue in SCID mice led to a decrease in stromal (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and an increase in adipose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) percent areas, compared to placebo-treated mice. No histologic or radiographic differences were observed in low MD biochamber tissue with any treatment. High MD biochamber tissues maintained in mice implanted with Tamoxifen, oestrogen or placebo pellets had dynamic and measurable histologic compositional and radiographic changes. This further validates the dynamic nature of the MD xenograft model, and suggests the biochamber model may be useful for assessing the underlying molecular pathways of Tamoxifen-reduced MD, and in testing of other pharmacologic interventions in a preclinical model of high MD.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2014-10-22", "authors": ["G LChew", "C WHuo", "DHuang", "TBlick", "PHill", "JCawson", "HFrazer", "M CSouthey", "J LHopper", "KBritt", "M AHenderson", "IHaviv", "E WThompson"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-014-3169-2"}
{"title": "VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis is mediated by NAADP and two-pore channel-2-dependent Ca2+ signaling.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGFR1/VEGFR2 play major roles in controlling angiogenesis, including vascularization of solid tumors. Here we describe a specific Ca(2+) signaling pathway linked to the VEGFR2 receptor subtype, controlling the critical angiogenic responses of endothelial cells (ECs) to VEGF. Key steps of this pathway are the involvement of the potent Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger, nicotinic acid adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), and the specific engagement of the two-pore channel TPC2 subtype on acidic intracellular Ca(2+) stores, resulting in Ca(2+) release and angiogenic responses. Targeting this intracellular pathway pharmacologically using the NAADP antagonist Ned-19 or genetically using Tpcn2(-/-) mice was found to inhibit angiogenic responses to VEGF in vitro and in vivo. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) Ned-19 abolished VEGF-induced Ca(2+) release, impairing phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, eNOS, JNK, cell proliferation, cell migration, and capillary-like tube formation. Interestingly, Tpcn2 shRNA treatment abolished VEGF-induced Ca(2+) release and capillary-like tube formation. Importantly, in vivo VEGF-induced vessel formation in matrigel plugs in mice was abolished by Ned-19 and, most notably, failed to occur in Tpcn2(-/-) mice, but was unaffected in Tpcn1(-/-) animals. These results demonstrate that a VEGFR2/NAADP/TPC2/Ca(2+) signaling pathway is critical for VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Given that VEGF can elicit both pro- and antiangiogenic responses depending upon the balance of signal transduction pathways activated, targeting specific VEGFR2 downstream signaling pathways could modify this balance, potentially leading to more finely tailored therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-10-22", "authors": ["AnnaritaFavia", "MariannaDesideri", "GuidoGambara", "AlessioD'Alessio", "MargaridaRuas", "BiancaEsposito", "DonatellaDel Bufalo", "JohnParrington", "ElioZiparo", "FiorettaPalombi", "AntonyGalione", "AntonioFilippini"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1406029111\n10.1128/MCB.00113-14"}

The purpose was to investigate the effect of genetically-modified hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), combined with Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds, on the vascularization of tissue-engineered skin.\nThree-dimensional (3D) Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 gene-modified rat HFSCs (rHFSCs) were inoculated into the scaffolds and cultured for 7 days. Two bilateral full-thickness skin defects were created on the back of 18 Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A, HFSCs transduced with VEGF165 seeded onto Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds; Group B, HFSCs transduced with empty vector seeded onto Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds; Group C, Gel-C6S-HA scaffold only; Group D, Vaseline gauze dressing. These compositions were implanted onto the defects and harvested at 7, 14 and 21 days. Wound healing was assessed and compared among groups according to hematoxylin-eosin staining, CD31 expression, alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) immunohistochemistry, and microvessel density (MVD) count, to evaluate the new blood vessels.\nSEM revealed the Gel-C6S-HA scaffold was spongy and 3D, with an average pore diameter of 133.23\u2009\u00b1\u200943.36 \u03bcm. Cells seeded on scaffolds showed good adherent growth after 7 days culture. No significant difference in rHFSC morphology, adherence and proliferative capacity was found before and after transfection (P >0.05). After 14 and 21 days, the highest rate of wound healing was observed in Group A (P <0.05). Histological and immunological examination showed that after 21 days, MVD also reached a maximum in Group A (P <0.05). Therefore, the number of new blood vessels formed within the skin substitutes was greatest in Group A, followed by Group B. In Group C, only trace amounts of mature subcutaneous blood vessels were observed, and few subcutaneous tissue cells migrated into the scaffolds.\nTissue-engineered skin constructs, using 3D Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds seeded with VEGF165-modified rHFSCs, resulted in promotion of angiogenesis during wound healing and facilitation of vascularization in skin substitutes.

To explore alternative methods of mandibular reconstruction, we sought to compare bone graft obtained with the reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA) device with the free fibula (FF) flap for the reconstruction of a critical-sized mandibular defect.\nSixteen 3-month-old Yorkshire pigs underwent 6-cm full-thickness resection of the left mandible.

A major pro-inflammatory factors found elevated in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and to be overexpressed in peritoneal fluid macrophages and active, highly vascularized and early stage endometriotic lesions, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) appeared to induce angiogenic and inflammatory and estrogen producing phenotypes in endometriotic cells in vitro and to be a possible therapeutic target in vivo. Using a mouse model where MIF-knock out (KO) mice received intra-peritoneal injection of endometrial tissue from MIF-KO or syngeneic wild type (WT) mice and vice versa, our current study revealed that MIF genetic depletion resulted in a marked reduction ectopic endometrial tissue growth, a disrupted tissue structure and a significant down regulation of the expression of major inflammatory (cyclooxygenease-2), cell adhesion (\u03b1v and \u03b23 integrins), survival (B-cell lymphoma-2) and angiogenic (vascular endothelial cell growth) factors relevant to endometriosis pathogenesis, whereas MIF add-back to MIF-KO mice significantly restored endometriosis-like lesions number and size.

Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) performed during endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a new technology enabling real-time imaging of the internal structure of such cysts. The aim of this pilot study was to identify and validate new diagnostic criteria on nCLE for pancreatic cystic lesions.\nA total of 31 patients with a solitary pancreatic cystic lesion of unknown diagnosis were prospectively included at three centers. EUS-FNA was combined with nCLE. The final diagnosis was based on either a stringent gold standard (surgical specimen and/or positive cytopathology) or a committee consensus. Six nonblinded investigators reviewed nCLE sequences from patients with the most stringent final diagnosis, and identified a single feature that was only present in serous cystadenoma (SCA). The findings were correlated with the pathology of archived specimens. After a training session, four blinded independent observers reviewed a separate independent video set, and the yield and interobserver agreement for the criterion were assessed.\nA superficial vascular network pattern visualized on nCLE was identified as the criterion.

In addition to the osteoinductivity of BMPs, their angiogenic potential is important as an adequate blood supply is a prerequisite for bone-healing. We used a rabbit long-bone defect model to investigate whether angiogenicity and osteogenicity were correlated features of a BMP molecule by comparing the induction of blood vessel and bone formation by BMP-2, GDF-5, and a previously created swap mutant GDF-5V453/V456 (BB-1) with elevated BMP receptor-IA binding.\nMicrocomputed tomography and immunohistochemistry were used to assess early bone formation and neovascularization in 15-mm (critical-sized) rabbit radius defects treated with a growth factor-loaded collagen carrier.\nBlood vessel volume and surface area on days 7 and 14 after surgery were significantly greater in defects treated with GDF-5 and with BB-1 compared with controls (p < 0.05); BMP-2 enhanced vascularization on day 14 (p < 0.05). Cumulative data including both time points reflected increased vessel volume, intersection surface area, and number of vessels after treatment with GDF-5 and BB-1 compared with BMP-2 (p < 0.05), corresponding to the histology results. Each of the growth factors resulted in enhanced bone formation compared with controls on day 14 (p < 0.01), with BB-1 resulting in significantly more bone compared with GDF-5 as indicated by bone volume and surface area (p = 0.006).\nBoth GDF-5 and BB-1 had high angiogenicity, and BB-1 outperformed GDF-5 with respect to osteogenicity. Strong induction of bone formation by BMP-2 and BB-1 was thus associated with BMP receptor-IA-dependent signaling, whereas the vascularization outcome was not.\nAlthough both BMP-2 and the GDF-5 variant BB-1 are good inducers of bone formation, BB-1 is especially promising for long-bone healing if high angiogenicity is desired along with high osteogenicity to promote recreation of optimal bone architecture.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

{"title": "Mechanism of tumour vascularization in experimental lung metastases.", "abstract": "The appearance of lung metastases is associated with poor outcome and the management of patients with secondary pulmonary tumours remains a clinical challenge. We examined the vascularization process of lung metastasis in six different preclinical models and found that the tumours incorporated the pre-existing alveolar capillaries (ie vessel co-option). During the initial phase of vessel co-option, the incorporated capillaries were still sheathed by pneumocytes, but these incorporated vessels subsequently underwent different fates dependent on the model. In five of the models examined (B16, HT1080, HT25, C26, and MAT B-III), the tumour cells gradually stripped the pneumocytes from the vessels. These dissected pneumocytes underwent fragmentation, but the incorporated microvessels survived. In the sixth model (C38), the tumour cells failed to invade the alveolar walls. Instead, they induced the development of vascularized desmoplastic tissue columns. Finally, we examined the process of arterialization in lung metastases and found that they became arterialized when their diameter grew to exceed 5\u2009mm.

Although the porosity grade of both PCL-AT-HA and PCL-AT-BP promoted optimal conditions for the cell growth of rMSCs at the early phase, the presence of BP was crucial to prolong the cell viability at the late phase.

In contrast to cell injection, bioengineered tissue transplantation minimizes cell loss and has the potential to repair tissue defects. A popular approach is scaffold-based tissue engineering, which utilizes a biodegradable polymer scaffold for seeding cells; however, new techniques of cell sheet-based tissue engineering have been developed. Cell sheets are harvested from temperature-responsive culture dishes by simply lowering the temperature. Monolayer or stacked cell sheets are transplantable directly onto damaged tissues and cell sheet transplantation has already been clinically applied. Cardiac cell sheet stacking produces pulsatile heart tissue; however, lack of vasculature limits the viable tissue thickness to 3 layers. Multistep transplantation of triple-layer cardiac cell sheets cocultured with endothelial cells has been used to form thick vascularized cardiac tissue in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro functional blood vessel formation within 3-dimensional (3D) tissues has been realized by successfully imitating in vivo conditions. Triple-layer cardiac cell sheets containing endothelial cells were layered on vascular beds and the constructs were media-perfused using novel bioreactor systems. Interestingly, cocultured endothelial cells migrate into the vascular beds and form perfusable blood vessels.

The phenomenon is caused by the unique homeostatic compartmentalization of blood hemoglobin exclusively inside erythrocytes. On the contrary, the normalized ThOR in aqueous solutions of hemoglobin showed linear variation with respect to its concentration and was identical to that of blood when extrapolated to the hemoglobin concentration inside erythrocytes. To substantiate the conclusions, we analyzed optoacoustic images acquired from the samples of whole and diluted blood as well as hemoglobin solutions during gradual cooling from +37 to -15\u2009\u00b0C. Our experimental methodology allowed direct observation and accurate measurement of the temperature of zero optoacoustic response, manifested as the sample's image faded into background and then reappeared in the reversed (negative) contrast.

We generated bioartificial airway tissue using a cell-free biological vascularized scaffold that was re-endothelialized and reseeded with the recipient's autologous primary cells and we implanted it into the recipient's left main bronchus. To investigate host-integration 2.5 years after the implantation, we obtained biopsies of the implant and adjacent tracheal tissue and processed these for histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The early postoperative course was uneventful and the transplanted airway tissue was integrated into the host. 2.5 years after transplantation, a bronchoscopy confirmed the scar-free reconstruction of the former airway defect.

More than 50% of patients show metastasis at diagnosis, with the involvement of different vascularized tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). In this paper, we focus on BM infiltration by NB cells, which is considered an adverse prognostic factor. In particular, we discuss the role of different biological factors that may favor the dissemination of NB cells in the BM, such as chromosomic abnormalities, gene amplification, transcription factors, cell-surface receptors, products of oncogenes, and, more importantly, cytokines and chemokines. In addition, we analyze different techniques to evaluate BM infiltration by malignant cells (i.e., flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction).

{"title": "Hand-Dorsa Vein Recognition by Matching Local Features of Multisource Keypoints.", "abstract": "As an emerging biometric for people identification, the dorsal hand vein has received increasing attention in recent years due to the properties of being universal, unique, permanent, and contactless, and especially its simplicity of liveness detection and difficulty of forging. However, the dorsal hand vein is usually captured by near-infrared (NIR) sensors and the resulting image is of low contrast and shows a very sparse subcutaneous vascular network. Therefore, it does not offer sufficient distinctiveness in recognition particularly in the presence of large population. This paper proposes a novel approach to hand-dorsa vein recognition through matching local features of multiple sources. In contrast to current studies only concentrating on the hand vein network, we also make use of person dependent optical characteristics of the skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed by NIR hand-dorsa images and encode geometrical attributes of their landscapes, e.g., ridges, valleys, etc., through different quantities, such as cornerness and blobness, closely related to differential geometry. Specifically, the proposed method adopts an effective keypoint detection strategy to localize features on dorsal hand images, where the speciality of absorption and scattering of the entire dorsal hand is modeled as a combination of multiple (first-, second-, and third-) order gradients. These features comprehensively describe the discriminative clues of each dorsal hand. This method further robustly associates the corresponding keypoints between gallery and probe samples, and finally predicts the identity. Evaluated by extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves the best performance so far known on the North China University of Technology (NCUT) Part A dataset, showing its effectiveness.

There are several metabolites known to mediate this transition; however, the effect of sarcosine that accumulates in invasive prostate cancer is not known. The objective of the study was to examine whether sarcosine influences EC function and affects angiogenesis.\nThe effect of sarcosine was studied using different model systems including chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), rat aortic rings in culture, and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in culture. The statistical significance of difference was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test using GraphPad 5 software.\nIncreased vascularization in CAM, increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings in culture, and increased expression of CD31 and E-selectin suggested a possible angiogenic effect of sarcosine. Sarcosine modulated expression of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In ECs in culture LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) reversed the effect of sarcosine. Further, sarcosine induced upregulation and activation of Akt in HUVECs.\nThese results suggest that sarcosine modulates EC function relevant to angiogenesis through modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.", "journal": "Journal of cancer research and therapeutics", "date": "2014-10-15", "authors": ["Peruman RSudhakaran", "SheelaBinu", "Sasikumar JSoumya"], "doi": "10.4103/0973-1482.137945"}

Here, we describe a patient with sarcoidosis and mediastinitis after EUS-FNA.\nTwo years before EUS-FNA, the patient with a history of sarcoidosis, was operated because of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Due to progredient mediastinal lymphoma, we performed EUS-FNA to exclude tumor recurrence. 30 hours later, the patient developed general weakness, musculoskeletal pain, non-productive cough, and mild dysphagia. Ten days later, the patient was admitted with fever and thrombocytopenia. A CT scan showed a mediastinal mass without liquid areas, but small deposits of air. Meropenem, steroid, and low-dose heparin were started. The fever resolved after 24 hours, CRP, as well as coagulatory parameters returned to normal levels after 5 days. Endoscopic ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous, slightly hyperechoic, mediastinal mass. The lymph nodes were partly dislodged, and partly embedded into this mass with a rounded shape and large hyperechoic center. Vascularization was not increased, liquid areas, or inclusions of gas were not present. A follow-up examination 6 weeks later revealed complete resolution of the mass.\nEUS-FNA, but not EBUS-FNA, seems to be associated with an increased infectious risk in patients with sarcoidosis. Endosonographic features include inhomogeneous, mass-forming mediastinal infiltration, and swelling of lymph nodes with hyperechoic central parts.

We previously discovered that a genetically modified mouse model displays impaired healing similar to problematic wounds in humans and that sometimes the wounds become chronic. Here we show how and why these impaired wounds become chronic, describe a way whereby we can drive impaired wounds to chronicity at will and propose that the same processes are involved in chronic wound development in humans. We hypothesize that exacerbated levels of oxidative stress are critical for initiation of chronicity. We show that, very early after injury, wounds with impaired healing contain elevated levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and, much like in humans, these levels increase with age. Moreover, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes is not elevated, leading to buildup of oxidative stress in the wound environment. To induce chronicity, we exacerbated the redox imbalance by further inhibiting the antioxidant enzymes and by infecting the wounds with biofilm-forming bacteria isolated from the chronic wounds that developed naturally in these mice. These wounds do not re-epithelialize, the granulation tissue lacks vascularization and interstitial collagen fibers, they contain an antibiotic-resistant mixed bioflora with biofilm-forming capacity, and they stay open for several weeks. These findings are highly significant because they show for the first time that chronic wounds can be generated in an animal model effectively and consistently. The availability of such a model will significantly propel the field forward because it can be used to develop strategies to regain redox balance that may result in inhibition of biofilm formation and result in restoration of healthy wound tissue.

MALDI-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) were performed for detection of CPT-11 and SN-38 in tissue sections from mice post CPT-11 injection. In-depth information was gained about\u00a0the distribution and quantity of drug compounds in normal and tumor tissue.

In tumors from genetic mouse models for colorectal cancer (Apc (1638N/wt) x pvillin-Kras (V12G) ), CPT-11 was detected but not the active metabolite. In order to correlate drug distribution relative to vascularization, MALDI data were superimposed with CD31 (PECAM-1) immunohistochemistry. This analysis indicated that intratumoral access of CPT-11 mainly occurred by extravasation from microvessels.

Our results demonstrated that L + CG group showed a statistically significant increase in the density of vascular endothelial cells and blood vessels over time. In addition, tissue concentrations of angiogenic growth factors (such as VEGF, FGF2, and PDGF) significantly increased in L + CG group.

The quality of utero-placental vasculature is essential for a proper fetal development and a successful progress of pregnancy. However, the in vivo assessment of placental vascularization with non-invasive methods is complicated by the small size of placental terminal vessel and its complex architecture.

Since this class of compounds has not been investigated for their immunosuppressive potential, our goal was to determine the influence of a prototypic ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor on allograft survival.

Also, a marked decrease of nestin expression in immature progenitor cells, along with a marked increase of the same marker in cardiomyocytes, (signs of myocardium regeneration), was found in experimental animals when compared to control animals that did not receive isoflurane treatment.\nBased on our results, we can emphasize two morphologically detectable benefits of isoflurane postconditioning: a marked reduction in infarct size along with a more mature-looking infarct area in the chronic phase of infarct healing.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2014-10-13", "authors": ["IvanAgni\u0107", "NatalijaFilipovi\u0107", "KatarinaVukojevi\u0107", "MirnaSaraga-Babi\u0107", "MarijaVrdoljak", "IvicaGrkovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2014.09.004"}
{"title": "GLUT-1 expression is largely unrelated to both hypoxia and the Warburg phenotype in squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva.", "abstract": "Strongly increased uptake of glucose is a hallmark of solid malignant tumors. This phenotype can be triggered by hypoxia-induced gene expression changes or can occur independently of hypoxia as a consequence of malignant transformation itself, and is often referred to as the Warburg effect. The glycolytic phenotype has been associated with malignant progression and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.\nWe have chosen squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva (SCC-V) as a representative solid tumor entity to study the central players of this pathway, namely glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX, hexokinase (HK)-2 and pyruvate kinase (PK)-M2, and have investigated their relationships to tumor microvessels (CD34, \u03b1SMA) and proliferation (Ki67). Expression of these proteins was analyzed in 38 SCC-Vs, 5 vulvar dysplasias and 10 non-neoplastic squamous epithelia of the vulva using multiparametric immunohistochemistry in registered serial sections (MIRSS).\nExpression of GLUT-1 in invasive carcinomas was predominantly located in the outer layers of the tumor cell aggregates close to the vascularized tumor stroma, and only to a lesser extent colocalized with CA IX, which was repeatedly found at larger diffusion distances away from microvessels. CA IX expression was lower in invasive carcinomas compared to dysplasias and non-neoplastic tissue and higher in recurrent vs. primary tumors. Ki67-positive proliferating cells were partially colocalized with GLUT-1.

Long-term CGM systems however require an accurate sensor as well as a suitable measuring environment. Since large intravenous sensors are not feasible, measuring inside the interstitial fluid is considered the best alternative. This option, unfortunately, has the drawback of a lag time with blood glucose values. A good strategy to circumvent this is to enhance tissue integration and enrich the peri-implant vasculature. Implants of different optically transparent biomaterials (poly(methyl-methacrylate) [PMMA] and poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS]) - enabling glucose monitoring in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum - were surface-treated and subsequently implanted in goats at various implantation sites for up to 3 months. The overall in\u00a0vivo biocompatibility, tissue integration, and vascularization at close proximity of the surfaces of these materials were assessed. Histological screening showed similar tissue reactions independent of the implantation site. No significant inflammation reaction was observed. Tissue integration and vascularization correlated, to some extent, with the biomaterial composition. A modification strategy, in which a vascular endothelial-cadherin antibody was coupled to the biomaterials surface through a dopamine layer, showed significantly enhanced vascularization 3 months after subcutaneous implantation. Our results suggest that the developed strategy enables the creation of tissue interactive NIR transparent packaging materials, opening the possibility of continuous glucose monitoring.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2014-10-12", "authors": ["KarolienGellynck", "Val\u00e9rieKodeck", "ElkeVan De Walle", "KenKersemans", "FilipDe Vos", "HeidiDeclercq", "PeterDubruel", "LievenVlaminck", "MariaCornelissen"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370214554878"}

{"title": "Regulation of endothelial permeability in the primate corpora lutea: implications for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.", "abstract": "In a developing human corpus luteum, a closely regulated cellular communication system exists between the luteal steroidogenic cells and endothelial cells. This system guaranties the vascularization process during luteal formation. The process is combined with rapid release of large amounts of progesterone into the bloodstream. The regulation of endothelial proliferation and permeability by LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is integral to this process. On the cellular level, endothelial permeability is regulated by intercellular junctions, such as adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ), which act as zipper-like structures between interacting endothelial cells. Several cell junctional proteins are localized to the corpus luteum, including Occludin, Nectin 2, Claudin 1, and Claudin 5, as well as, vascular endothelial (VE)-Cadherin. It has been assumed that regulation of AJ- and TJ-proteins is of particular importance for permeability, and accordingly, for the functionality of the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, because treatment with hCG induces downregulation of juntional proteins in the luteal vessels. The effect of hCG on the adhesive molecules is mediated by VE growth factor (VEGF). On a functional level, the hCG-dependent and VEGF-mediated decrease in junctional proteins causes a decrease in the density of cell-cell closure and, accordingly, an increase in endothelial permeability. In doing so, the different junctional proteins are not only directly influenced by VEGF but also interact among themselves and influence each other reciprocally. Disturbances in this strictly, regulated interactions may explain the development of pathologies with increased vascular permeability, such as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-10-11", "authors": ["DanielHerr", "IngaBekes", "ChristineWulff"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-13-0296"}

Typically, the co-implantation of MSCs with vascular endothelial cells (ECs) is effective for the induction of functional vascularization in vivo, indicating its potential applications in regenerative medicine. The effects of MSCs-ECs-induced vascularization can be modeled in vitro, providing simplified models for understanding their underlying communication. In this article, a contact coculture model in vitro and an RNA-seq approach were employed to reveal the active crosstalk between MSCs and ECs within a short time period at both morphological and transcriptional levels. The RNA-seq results suggested that angiogenic genes were significantly induced upon coculture, and this prevascularization commitment might require the NF-\u03baB signaling. NF-\u03baB blocking and interleukin (IL) neutralization experiments demonstrated that MSCs potentially secreted IL factors including IL1\u03b2 and IL6 to modulate NF-\u03baB signaling and downstream chemokines during coculture. Conversely, RNA-seq results indicated that the MSCs were regulated by the coculture environment to a smooth muscle commitment within this short period, which largely induced myocardin, the myogenic co-transcriptional factor.

{"title": "Serpina3n accelerates tissue repair in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing.", "abstract": "Chronic, non-healing wounds are a major complication of diabetes and are characterized by chronic inflammation and excessive protease activity. Although once thought to function primarily as a pro-apoptotic serine protease, granzyme B (GzmB) can also accumulate in the extracellular matrix (ECM) during chronic inflammation and cleave ECM proteins that are essential for proper wound healing, including fibronectin. We hypothesized that GzmB contributes to the pathogenesis of impaired diabetic wound healing through excessive ECM degradation. In the present study, the murine serine protease inhibitor, serpina3n (SA3N), was administered to excisional wounds created on the dorsum of genetically induced type-II diabetic mice. Wound closure was monitored and skin wound samples were collected for analyses. Wound closure, including both re-epithelialization and contraction, were significantly increased in SA3N-treated wounds. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of SA3N-treated wounds revealed a more mature, proliferative granulation tissue phenotype as indicated by increased cell proliferation, vascularization, fibroblast maturation and differentiation, and collagen deposition. Skin homogenates from SA3N-treated wounds also exhibited greater levels of full-length intact fibronectin compared with that of vehicle wounds. In addition, GzmB-induced detachment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts correlated with a rounded and clustered phenotype that was prevented by SA3N. In summary, topical administration of SA3N accelerated wound healing. Our findings suggest that GzmB contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic wound healing through the proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin that is essential for normal wound closure, and that SA3N promotes granulation tissue maturation and collagen deposition.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2014-10-10", "authors": ["IHsu", "L GParkinson", "YShen", "AToro", "TBrown", "HZhao", "R CBleackley", "D JGranville"], "doi": "10.1038/cddis.2014.423"}

{"title": "Contribution of corneal neovascularization to dendritic cell migration into the central area during human corneal infection.", "abstract": "Compared with the peripheral corneal limbus, the human central cornea lacks blood vessels, which is responsible for its immunologically privileged status and high transparency. Dendritic cells (DCs) are present in the central avascular area of inflamed corneas, but the mechanisms of their migration to this location are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of vessel formation to DC migration into the central cornea, and analyzed the DC chemotactic factors produced by human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Using human eyes obtained from surgical procedures, we then assessed vessel formation, DC distribution, and activin A expression immunohistochemically. The results demonstrated increased numbers of vessels and DCs in the central area of inflamed corneas, and a positive correlation between the number of vessels and DCs. Activin A was expressed in the subepithelial space and the endothelium of newly formed blood vessels in the inflamed cornea. In infected corneas, DCs were present in the central area but no vascularization was observed, suggesting the presence of chemotactic factors that induced DC migration from the limbal vessels. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the migration of monocyte-derived DCs toward HCE cell supernatants with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of HCE cells and inflammatory cytokines (released by HCE cells). DCs migrated toward tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, and activin A, as well as LPS-stimulated HCE cell supernatants. The supernatant contained elevated TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and activin A levels, suggesting that they were produced by HCE cells after LPS stimulation. Therefore, vessels in the central cornea might constitute a DC migration route, and activin A expressed in the endothelium of newly formed vessels might contribute to corneal vascularization. Activin A also functions as a chemotactic factor, similar to HCE-produced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.

{"title": "Coculture of peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells on strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate scaffolds to generate vascularized engineered bone.", "abstract": "Vascularization of engineered bone tissue is critical for ensuring its survival after implantation and it is the primary factor limiting its clinical use. A promising approach is to prevascularize bone grafts in vitro using endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) derived from peripheral blood. Typically, EPC are added together with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that differentiate into osteoblasts. One problem with this approach is how to promote traditional tissue engineering bone survival with a minimally invasive method. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of administering to stimulate the release of peripheral blood stem cells and their co-culturing system for generating prevascularized engineered bone. Cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and identified as EPC and MSC based on morphology, surface markers, and functional analysis. EPC and MSC were cocultured in several different ratios, and cell morphology and tube formation were assessed by microscopy. Expression of osteogenesis and vascularization markers was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction, and histochemical and immunofluorescence staining. Increasing the proportion of EPC in the coculture system led to greater tube formation and greater expression of the endothelial cell marker CD31. An EPC:MSC ratio of 75:25 gave the highest expression of osteogenesis and angiogenesis markers. Cocultures adhered to a three-dimensional scaffold of strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate and proliferated well.

This process has elements that are similar to both wound healing and tumour development, and its features are illustrated by reference to the bottom-up generation of a tissue using modular constructs. These modular constructs consist of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) embedded in endothelial cell (EC)-covered collagen gel rods that are a few hundred microns in size.

{"title": "Immunological aspects of corneal transplant.", "abstract": "Corneal transplant is the most common solid tissue transplant in humans. Advances in microsurgical techniques, eye banking and the use of corticosteroids have improved the success of corneal transplants. Over 65,000 corneal transplants are being performed worldwide annually. Most of these transplants are performed in developed countries. Cornea is considered an immune privileged site. Despite this, immune mediated graft rejection is the most single cause of cornea graft failure and is one of the major postoperative complications. Incidences from as low as 2% to as high as 50% have been reported depending upon the degree of vascularization. Rejection involves donor tissue recognition and various factors may influence this rejection. Major factors include the antigenic load of the donor tissue; other factors include death to enucleation time, methods and temperature of preserving the tissue. Host factors that may impact the graft include ocular surface diseases such as dry eye, chemical burns and autoimmune diseases such as mucous membrane pemphigoid. Following infection, surgery or trauma, cells of the innate immune system invade the cornea as a result of up-regulation of cytokines, cellular adhesion molecules and growth and angiogenic factors. These factors results in neoangiogenesis and lymphoangiogenesis, leading to immune activation and graft rejection.

After this in ovo CAM (iCAM) culture, the survival rates of the eggs and testes were assessed histologically and immunohistologically. The transplanted testes in the chicken embryos that survived were supported by the CAM, with an associated chronic vascularization response. The testes cultured at 35.0 \u00b0C had lower rates of generation and higher rates of death than did those cultured at 37.5 \u00b0C. Histologic examination of the testes cultured at 37.5 \u00b0C revealed the presence of spermatogonia and primary spermatocyte-like germ cells in the seminiferous tubules. The number of cells positive for synaptonemal complex protein 3 in the seminiferous tubules was significantly higher than that in the noniCAM-cultured testes from control mice.

This review will provide a brief analysis of some of the most promising improvements in the field, with particular attention to the techniques that could prove easily transferable to other branches of tissue engineering.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-10-09", "authors": ["GiorgioCittadella Vigodarzere", "SaraMantero"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00362\n10.1016/j.nmd.2004.03.009\n10.1016/j.jcms.2012.05.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.047\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0570\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1000029\n10.1038/nature11807\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68438-9\n10.1007/s10439-013-0963-7\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003688\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090398\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0313\n10.1016/j.nano.2010.01.009\n10.1073/pnas.1107019108\n10.1056/NEJMc076383\n10.1369/jhc.2010.956201\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.01.039\n10.1046/j.1524-475x.1999.00026.x\n10.3389/fimmu.2011.00062\n10.1055/s-0029-1185513\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003997\n10.5301/JABB.2010.4829\n10.1038/nature03875\n10.1038/srep01420\n10.1152/physrev.00019.2003\n10.1182/blood-2011-02-338426\n10.1073/pnas.1210580109\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-421040\n10.2174/138161210790883453\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.035\n10.1152/ajpcell.00189.2013\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0761\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.061\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.045\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3001426\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.010\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1929\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1034\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0517\n10.1038/ncomms1508\n10.1290/1071-2690(2000)036<0327:EAICPO>2.0.CO;2\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0164\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.025\n10.1083/jcb.200405004\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.06.015\n10.1038/ncomms2530\n10.1089/ten.teb.2012.0723\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00203\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00453\n10.2217/17460751.4.2.293\n10.1007/s10456-012-9304-y\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.05.012\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.257\n10.1021/nl402930x\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.04.019\n10.1038/nature07039\n10.5966/sctm.2012-0111\n10.1038/nprot.2012.027\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.053\n10.1096/fj.11-182246\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.04.019\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0583\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0181\n10.1038/173973a0\n10.11138/mltj/2013.3.4.337\n10.1038/ncb2015\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.06.022\n10.1073/pnas.1402723111\n10.1182/blood-2011-08-375188\n10.1007/s10439-004-7825-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.054\n10.1002/mus.23688\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.029\n10.1038/nm.1985\n10.1002/stem.37\n10.1073/pnas.1017825108\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00032\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.014\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1002/stem.1082\n10.1038/ncomms3353\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05082.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.003\n10.1038/nbt1109\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0700\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.10.057\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.11.007\n10.1002/1097-4598(200011)23:11<1647::AID-MUS1>3.0.co;2-M\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044375\n10.1111/jcmm.12062\n10.1038/ncomms4938\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.016\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6\n10.1002/path.4133\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3008558\n10.3928/01477447-20100526-24\n10.1083/jcb.9.2.493\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60248-8\n10.1038/nmat2812\n10.2217/rme.13.81\n10.1038/nmat3357\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0079\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.062\n10.1002/emmm.201202096\n10.1089/hgtb.2012.197\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.009\n10.1242/dev.064162\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.08.055\n10.1067/mtc.2003.134\n10.1007/s10237-014-0558-8\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0534\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1002/bit.24626\n10.1016/j.molmed.2012.07.004\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002717\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0089\n10.1002/bit.20722\n10.1152/ajpheart.00171.2003\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0584\n10.1038/ncomms5324\n10.1002/jbm.a.31534\n10.1073/pnas.0911465107\n10.1002/term.414\n10.1101/gad.234468.113\n10.1111/febs.12166\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.03.082\n10.1038/srep01316\n10.1039/c1ib00045d\n10.1002/term.1881\n10.1007/s00595-011-0106-4\n10.1016/0040-8166(76)90039-2\n10.1038/ncomms2406\n10.1073/pnas.1222878110\n10.1002/term.1780\n10.1073/pnas.1402679111\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2012.00869.x\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-138\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3008085\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00349\n10.1038/mt.2013.71\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2012.09.001\n10.2217/rme.13.30\n10.1097/WCO.0b013e328357f288\n10.1172/JCI40373\n10.1002/mus.10453\n10.1002/jcp.22127\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00218\n10.1681/ASN.2009111156\n10.1242/dev.098285\n10.1152/ajpregu.00735.2009\n10.1016/j.vph.2008.08.003\n10.1007/s00441-011-1185-7\n10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.1029\n10.1242/jcs.086629\n10.1073/pnas.1109861108\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0214\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0445\n10.1007/BF02623542\n10.1007/s12035-013-8412-z\n10.1038/nrm2594\n10.1038/nrm3265\n10.1002/term.551\n10.1002/term.537\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.055\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2007.06.002\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0452"}

Steroid-induced ONFH was induced in 65 mature male New Zealand white rabbits by methylprednisolone in combination with lipopolysaccharide. Six weeks later, the rabbits received no treatment (model group, N\u2009=\u200915), bilateral core decompression (CD group, N\u2009=\u200920) or CD in combination with local DFO administration (DFO group, N\u2009=\u200920). Six weeks after the surgery, vascularization in the femoral head was evaluated by ink artery infusion angiography and immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Bone repair was assessed by histologic analysis and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and osteocalcin (OCN). Ink artery infusion angiography and microvessel analysis by immuohistochemical staining for vWF showed more blood vessels in the DFO group than other groups. The expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, BMP-2, and OCN, indicated by immunohistochemical staining, was higher in the DFO group compared with other groups. Micro-CT scanning results indicated that the DFO group had larger volume of newly formed bone than the CD group.

Cancer stemlike cells can be isolated from long-term cancer cell lines, including glioma lines. Using sphere formation as a model for cancer cell stemness in vitro, we derived sphere cultures from SMA-497, SMA-540, SMA-560, and GL-261 glioma cells. Gene expression and proteomics profiling demonstrated that sphere cultures uniformly showed an elevated expression of stemness-associated genes, notably including CD44. Differences in neural lineage marker expression between nonsphere and sphere cultures were heterogeneous except for a uniform reduction of \u03b2-III-tubulin in sphere cultures. All sphere cultures showed slower growth. Self-renewal capacity was influenced by medium conditions but not nonsphere versus sphere culture phenotype. Sphere cultures were more resistant to irradiation, whereas both nonsphere and sphere cultures were highly resistant to temozolomide. Nonsphere cells formed more aggressive tumors in syngeneic mice than sphere cells in all models except SMA-560. There were no major differences in vascularization or infiltration by T cells or microglia/macrophages between nonsphere and sphere cell-derived tumors implanted in syngeneic hosts.

We have developed a method of raising the latissimus dorsi flap through the anterior mastectomy incisions without requiring special instruments or repositioning. This can provide autologous vascularized cover of the prosthesis.\nA clear surgical description of the scarless latissimus dorsi flap harvest is provided, and our results of a retrospective cohort review of 20 consecutive patients with 27 traditional latissimus dorsi breast reconstructions were compared with those of 20 consecutive patients with 30 scarless latissimus dorsi breast reconstructions.\nOperative time, length of stay, and complication rates were reduced in the scarless group. Patients Breast-Q scores were equivalent in each group. The aesthetic assessment was good/excellent in 77% of both groups; however, subscale assessment was better in the scarless group. This was statistically significant (P = 0.0).\nBreast reconstruction using the scarless latissimus dorsi flap is time effective, requires no patient repositioning, and uses standard breast instrumentation. It is safe and versatile while reducing the risk of exposed prosthesis if native skin necrosis occurs. It is a vascularized alternative to acellular dermal matrices.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

However, preoperative irradiation increases the complication rate and thus some consider preoperative radiotherapy a relative contraindication to alloplastic alone reconstruction. We evaluated the long-term outcomes of patients with preoperative radiotherapy who had delayed alloplastic reconstruction with a TDAP flap.\nA retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify patients who had received a Latissimus Dorsi (LD), a Muscle Sparing Latissimus Dorsi (MSLD), or a TDAP flap plus a tissue expander or implant between 2005 and 2012. Information regarding patients' primary diagnosis, radiation history, prior breast reconstructions, and complications was collected and analyzed.\nSixteen patients who had a total of 16 breast reconstructions with an LD (6) or TDAP/MSLD1 flap (10). Demographic data, device type, co-morbidities and complications were analyzed. The rate of capsular contracture and size asymmetry were higher in the LD group, but there was no difference noted for major complications. Minor complications were also similar between the 2 groups.\nPatients who underwent irradiation before TDAP flap did not have a higher complication rate when compared with patients who had a full LD flap following radiation. By integrating well-vascularized, nonradiated tissue of a TDAP flap in reconstruction, overall complication rate may be minimized and the results are comparable to the generally accepted method of utilizing the entire latissimus dorsi muscle.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Its clinical necessities were emphasized in multiple case series to reconstruct large abdominal defects. Previous animal models have only studied components of the abdominal wall transplant. We describe findings from a new model that more likely reflect clinical transplantation.\nFull-thickness hemiabdominal wall flap was procured from Brown Norway (BN) rats and transplanted to an orthotopic defect on Lewis rats. Three groups were studied: group 1: Lewis to Lewis syngeneic; group 2: BN to Lewis control; and group 3: BN to Lewis with postoperative cyclosporine. Vascular imaging and cross vessel section were performed along with full-thickness abdominal wall. Immune cell profiling with flow cytometry at different time points was studied in all groups.\nSyngeneic group had no rejection. Control group consistently showed rejection around postoperative day 6. With cyclosporine treatment, however, transplant and recipient tissue integration was observed. Flow cytometry revealed that innate immunity is responsible for the initial inflammatory events following abdominal wall engraftment. Adaptive immunity cells, specifically interferon-\u03b3-producing T helper (Th) 1 and interleukin-17-producing Th17 cells, dramatically and positively correlate with rejection progression of abdominal wall transplants.\nTechnical, histological, and immunological aspects of a new rat model are described.

Endometrial vasculature is important in the early endometrial response to blastocyst implantation, and vascular changes can affect uterine receptivity. This study aims to investigate whether vascular parameters measured using three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound (3D PD-US) could predict pregnancy following fresh in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) using a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist long protocol.\nThis prospective observational study enrolled 236 nulliparous women who underwent a first IVF-ET using a GnRH long protocol with stimulation by recombinant FSH (rFSH) from May 2009 to April 2012. After excluding two cases of tubal pregnancy, 234 women were in either a pregnant group (n = 113) or a nonpregnant group (n = 121). Color Doppler ultrasound and 3D PD-US examinations were performed on the day of embryo transfer. Main outcomes were pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) of the uterine artery, vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) of the endometrium and subendometrial region. Measurements were analyzed relative to IVF-ET outcome (pregnant vs. nonpregnant).\nNo significant differences were observed in patient age, infertility duration, body mass index (BMI), basal FSH levels, number of retrieved oocytes or good quality embryos, or endometrial thickness or volume between the two groups. The pregnant group had higher endometrial VI, FI, and VFI scores than the nonpregnant group (p = 0.001, p = 0.000, p = 0.021, respectively). By contrast, neither subendometrial region VI, FI, and VFI scores (p = 0.770, p = 0.252, p = 0.451), nor uterine artery PI, RI, or S/D scores (p = 0.256, p = 0.527, p = 0.365) differed between groups. Cut-off values of endometrial VI, FI, and VFI scores were 0.95, 12.94, and 0.15 for pregnancy achievement.\nThree dimensional PD-US was a useful and effective method for assessing endometrial blood flow in IVF cycles.

The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIL-1, HOIP, and SHARPIN, is the only known ubiquitin ligase that generates linear ubiquitin linkages.

Here, we show that both constitutive and Tie2-Cre-driven HOIP deletion lead to aberrant endothelial cell death, resulting in defective vascularization and embryonic lethality at midgestation. Ablation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) prevents cell death, vascularization defects, and death at midgestation. HOIP-deficient cells are more sensitive to death induction by both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LT-\u03b1), and aberrant complex-II formation is responsible for sensitization to TNFR1-mediated cell death in the absence of HOIP.

Histologically, primary and secondary osteons as basic structural elements of compact bone can also be affected by several toxicants leading to changes in bone vascularization and mechanical properties of the bone. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of subchronic peroral exposure to Cd on femoral bone structure including histomorphometry of the osteons in adult male rats. In our study, 20 one-month-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two experimental groups. In the first group, young males received a drinking water containing 30 mg of CdCl2/L, for 90 days. Ten one-month-old males without Cd intoxication served as a control group. After 90 days of daily peroral exposure, body weight, femoral weight, femoral length, cortical bone thickness and histological structure of the femora were analysed.\nWe found that subchronic peroral application of Cd had no significant effect on body weight, femoral length and cortical bone thickness in adult rats. On the other hand, femoral weight was significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in Cd-intoxicated rats. These rats also displayed different microstructure in the middle part of the compact bone where vascular canals expanded into central area of substantia compacta and supplied primary and secondary osteons. Additionally, a few resorption lacunae which are connected with an early stage of osteoporosis were identified in these individuals. Histomorphometrical evaluations showed that all variables (area, perimeter, maximum and minimum diameter) of the primary osteons' vascular canals, Haversian canals and secondary osteons were significantly decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the Cd group rats. This fact points to alterations in bone vascularization.\nSubchronic peroral exposure to Cd significantly influences femoral weight and histological structure of compact bone in adult male rats. It induces an early stage of osteoporosis and causes reduced bone vascularization.

For bilateral LSCD, similar approaches with limbal allografts have been unsuccessful largely due to strong immune rejection. Therefore, as an alternate strategy for treating bilateral LSCD, ex vivo expansion of the remaining LEST cells or autologous stem cells sourced from other potential sites is being explored. Different culture systems (with and without xenobiotic supplements) using substrates like amniotic membrane or fibrin gels have been used successfully for ex vivo LEST cell maintenance and reproduction by imitating the stem cell niche.

{"title": "Creating capillary networks within human engineered tissues: impact of adipocytes and their secretory products.", "abstract": "The development of tissue-engineered substitutes of substantial volume is closely associated with the need to ensure rapid vascularization upon grafting. Strategies promoting angiogenesis include the in vitro formation of capillary-like networks within engineered substitutes. We generated both connective and adipose tissues based on a cell sheet technology using human adipose-derived stromal cells. This study evaluates the morphology and extent of the capillary networks that developed upon seeding of human microvascular endothelial cells during tissue production. We posited that adipocyte presence/secretory products could modulate the resulting capillary network when compared to connective substitutes. Analyses including confocal imaging of CD31-labeled capillary-like networks indicated slight differences in their morphological appearance. However, the total volume occupied by the networks as well as the frequency distribution of the structure's volumes were similar between connective and adipose tissues. The average diameter of the capillary structures tended to be 20% higher in reconstructed adipose tissues. Quantification of pro-angiogenic molecules in conditioned media showed greater amounts of leptin (15\u00d7), angiopoietin-1 (3.4\u00d7) and HGF (1.7\u00d7) secreted from adipose than connective tissues at the time of endothelial cell seeding. However, this difference was attenuated during the following coculture period in endothelial cell-containing media, correlating with the minor differences noted between the networks. Taken together, we developed a protocol allowing reconstruction of both connective and adipose tissues featuring well-developed capillary networks in vitro. We performed a detailed characterization of the network architecture within engineered tissues that is relevant for graft assessment before implantation as well as for in vitro screening of angiogenic modulators using three-dimensional models.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-10-04", "authors": ["KimAubin", "CarolineVincent", "MaryseProulx", "DominiqueMayrand", "JulieFradette"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.044"}

{"title": "Pharmacokinetic modeling of ascorbate diffusion through normal and tumor tissue.", "abstract": "Ascorbate is delivered to cells via the vasculature, but its ability to penetrate into tissues remote from blood vessels is unknown. This is particularly relevant to solid tumors, which often contain regions with dysfunctional vasculature, with impaired oxygen and nutrient delivery, resulting in upregulation of the hypoxic response and also the likely depletion of essential plasma-derived biomolecules, such as ascorbate. In this study, we have utilized a well-established multicell-layered, three-dimensional pharmacokinetic model to measure ascorbate diffusion and transport parameters through dense tissue in vitro. Ascorbate was found to penetrate the tissue at a slightly lower rate than mannitol and to travel via the paracellular route. Uptake parameters into the cells were also determined. These data were fitted to the diffusion model, and simulations of ascorbate pharmacokinetics in normal tissue and in hypoxic tumor tissue were performed with varying input concentrations, ranging from normal dietary plasma levels (10-100 \u03bcM) to pharmacological levels (>1 mM) as seen with intravenous infusion. The data and simulations demonstrate heterogeneous distribution of ascorbate in tumor tissue at physiological blood levels and provide insight into the range of plasma ascorbate concentrations and exposure times needed to saturate all regions of a tumor.

{"title": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus downregulates transforming growth factor \u03b22 to promote enhanced stability of capillary-like tube formation.", "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor of AIDS patients worldwide. A key characteristic of KS tumors is extremely high levels of vascular slits and extravasated red blood cells, making neoangiogenesis a key component of the tumor. The main KS tumor cell is the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin that maintains KSHV predominantly in the latent state. In cultured endothelial cells, latent KSHV infection induces angiogenic phenotypes, including longer-term stabilization of capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix. The present studies show that KSHV infection of endothelial cells strongly downregulates transforming growth factor \u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22). This downregulation allows the stabilization of capillary-like tube formation during latent infection, as the addition of exogenous TGF-\u03b22 inhibits the KSHV-induced stability of these structures. While two KSHV microRNAs are sufficient to downregulate TGF-\u03b22 in endothelial cells, they are not required during KSHV infection. However, activation of the gp130 cell surface receptor is both necessary and sufficient for downregulation of TGF-\u03b22 in KSHV-infected cells.\nKaposi's sarcoma is a highly vascularized, endothelial cell-based tumor supporting large amounts of angiogenesis. There is evidence that KSHV, the etiologic agent of KS, induces aberrant angiogenesis. For example, KSHV induces stabilization of capillary-like tube formation in cultured endothelial cells. A clearer understanding of how KSHV regulates angiogenesis could provide potential therapeutic targets for KS. We found that KSHV downregulates TGF-\u03b22, a cytokine related to TGF-\u03b21 that is known to inhibit angiogenesis. The downregulation of this inhibitor promotes the stability of capillary-like tube formation insofar as adding back TGF-\u03b22 to infected cells blocks KSHV-induced long-term tubule stability. Therefore, KSHV downregulation of TGF-\u03b22 may increase aberrant vascularization in KS tumors through increased capillary formation and thereby aid in KS tumor promotion.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2014-10-03", "authors": ["Terri ADiMaio", "Kimberley DGutierrez", "MichaelLagunoff"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.01696-14\n10.1002/ijc.2910540106\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000101)85:1<54::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-D\n10.1161/01.RES.87.6.434\n10.1016/S0163-7258(03)00035-4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.10.036\n10.1006/mcbr.2001.0301\n10.1089/jop.2013.0220\n10.1159/000101315\n10.1038/nm.2252\n10.1074/jbc.M113.495531\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5988\n10.1124/jpet.108.147686\n10.1128/JVI.00016-07\n10.1128/JVI.02052-08\n10.1128/JVI.02333-06\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002424\n10.1038/nmeth746\n10.1073/pnas.0408192102\n10.1128/JVI.79.14.9301-9305.2005\n10.1371/journal.ppat.0030065\n10.1128/JVI.06245-11\n10.1128/JVI.06855-11\n10.1128/jvi.76.5.2440-2448.2002\n10.1038/nm0396-342\n10.1128/JVI.01019-12\n10.1186/1750-9378-7-S1-P27\n10.1016/j.chom.2009.03.003\n10.1016/j.virusres.2004.01.009\n10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.05.003\n10.1128/JVI.00766-08\n10.1016/j.virol.2012.03.013\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00432-X\n10.1016/j.coviro.2013.05.013\n10.1182/blood-2007-09-110544"}
{"title": "Diagnostic performance of elastography in cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules.", "abstract": "Cytological examination of material from fine-needle aspiration biopsy is the mainstay of diagnosis of thyroid nodules, thanks to its remarkable accuracy and scarcity of complications. However, follicular lesions (also called indeterminate lesions or Thy3 in the current classification), a heterogeneous group of lesions in which cytology is unable to give a definitive diagnosis to, represent its main limit. Elastography has been proposed as a potential diagnostic tool to define the risk of malignancy in the aforementioned nodules, but at present there is no conclusive data due to the small number of specifically addressed studies and the lack of concordance among them. The objective of our study was to evaluate the role of real-time elastography (RTE) for refining diagnosis of Thy3 nodules, by integrating diagnostic information provided by traditional ultrasound (US). The study included 108 patients with Thy3 nodules awaiting for surgery, which were evaluated by US (considering hypoecogenicity, irregular margins, microcalcifications, halo sign, and intranodular vascularization) and RTE. Nodules were classified at RTE using a four-class color scale. At histologic examination, 75 nodules were benign and 33 malignant. As expected, none of the ultrasound parameters alone was adequate in predicting malignancy or benignity of the nodules; in the presence of at least two US risk factors, we obtained 61 % sensitivity, 83 % specificity, and 77 % accuracy with 6.8 OR (95 % CI 2.4-20.4). RTE scores 3 and 4 showed 76 % sensitivity, 88 % specificity, 74 % PPV, and 89 % NPV with diagnostic accuracy of 84 %; the data are statistically significant (p < 0.0001) with a OR of 21.9 (95 % CI 7.1-76). By combining RTE with US parameters, the presence of at least 2 characters of suspicion had 88 % sensitivity and 94 % NPV with 23.8 OR (95 % CI 7-106.3).

We describe here the heterologous mouse models used so far and comparatively analyze the characteristics of human endometrial tissue after subcutaneous and intraperitoneal transplantation in nude and in Rag-1-deficient mice exhibiting T- and B-cell deficiency. Moreover, we extended the time of culturing to three months in both mouse strains. Size, histomorphology, and vascularization of xenografts of intraperitoneal and subcutaneous localization did not differ significantly nor did those of the two immunodeficient mouse strains for up to three months of culturing. Whereas the rate of lesions was similar at both localizations in nude mice, in Rag-1 knockout mice significantly more intraperitoneal than subcutaneous lesions could be recovered. Interestingly, in both mouse strains a considerable number of xenografts completely invaded the peritoneal lining after intraperitoneal transplantation and could only be recovered histomorphologically. This has to be taken into account in studies depending on the quantitative analysis of ectopic peritoneal lesions.

Perioperative (< 3 months) and postoperative (> 3 months) flap complications were assessed and revealed 3 perioperative flap defects (2.0%) defined as a visualized defect within the substrate of the flap and a total of 5 perioperative CSF leaks (3.3%). No patient experienced flap death/complete flap loss in the cohort. Assessed postoperative flap complications included 1 case (0.7%) of mucocele formation, 8 cases (5.3%) of prolonged skull base crusting, and 2 cases (1.3%) of donor-site complication, specifically septal perforation secondary to nasoseptal flap harvest. Among the 152 cases identified, 37 patients received radiation therapy while 114 patients did not undergo radiation therapy as part of the treatment profile. No significant association was found between perioperative complication rates and radiation therapy (p = 0.634). However, a significant association was found between postoperative complication rates and radiation therapy, primarily accounted for by an increased risk for prolonged (> 6 months) skull base crusting (p = 0.025). It is clear that larger skull base defects with high intraoperative CSF flow require thoughtful approach and strong consideration for vascularized repair.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2014-10-02", "authors": ["Brian DThorp", "Satyan BSreenath", "Charles SEbert", "Adam MZanation"], "doi": "10.3171/2014.7.FOCUS14350"}

A critical biomaterial design criterion is the synchronization of the rates of scaffold degradation and vascularized tissue formation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key enzymes that regulate neovascularization and extracellular matrix remodelling. Synthetic protease-sensitive hydrogels offer controllable environments for investigating the role of matrix degradation on neovascularization. In this study, PEG hydrogels containing MMP-sensitive peptides with increased catalytic activity for MMPs expressed during neovascularization were investigated. Scaffolds were functionalized with MMP-2-, MMP-14- or general collagenase-sensitive peptides and with varying peptide concentration using crosslinkers containing one (SSite) or multiple (TSite) repeats of each protease-sensitive sequence. Increasing peptide concentration enhanced the degradation kinetics of scaffolds functionalized with MMP-specific sequences while 80% of the collagenase-sensitive scaffolds remained upon exposure to MMP-2 and MMP-14.

Current models do not allow easy analysis of vascularization of implants in vivo, leaving it a highly desirable goal. A tool that allows monitoring of perfusion capacity of such biomaterials noninvasively in a cheap, efficient, and reliable in vivo model would hence add great benefit to research in this field. We established, for the first time, an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to quantify the perfusion capacity of a model biomaterial, DegraPol(\u00ae) foam scaffold, placed on the embryonic avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo. Perfusion capacity was assessed through changes in the longitudinal relaxation rate before and after injection of a paramagnetic MRI contrast agent, Gd-DOTA (Dotarem(\u00ae); Guerbet S.A.). Relaxation rate changes were compared in three different regions of the scaffold, that is, at the interface to the CAM, in the middle and on the surface of the scaffold (p<0.05). The highest relaxation rate changes, and hence perfusion capacities, were measured in the interface region where the scaffold was attached to the CAM, whereas the surface of the scaffold showed the lowest relaxation rate changes. A strong positive correlation was obtained between relaxation rate changes and histologically determined vessel density (R(2) = 0.983), which corroborates our MRI findings. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the perfusion capacity in different scaffold materials, silk fibroin either with or without human dental pulp stem cells. For these, three to four times larger perfusion capacities were obtained compared to DegraPol; demonstrating that our method is sensitive to reveal such differences. In summary, we present a novel in vivo method for analyzing the perfusion capacity in three-dimensional-biomaterials grown on the CAM, enabling the determination of the perfusion capacity of a large variety of bioengineered materials.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In this study, we demonstrate that mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Hrt2/Hey2 combined with global Hrt1/Hey1 deletion (H1(ko) /H2(eko) ) show abnormal vascular morphogenesis and embryonic lethality. Their defects were characterized by the failure of vascular network formation in the yolk sac, abnormalities of embryonic vascular structures and impaired smooth muscle cell recruitment, and were virtually identical to the H1(ko) /H2(ko) phenotypes.

As vascularization is an important factor for the distribution of drugs in tissues, we analyzed drug distribution as a function of blood vessel localization in tumor tissue. To explore distribution of the anticancer drugs afatinib, erlotinib, and sorafenib, a combined approach of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) drug imaging and immunohistochemical vessel staining was applied and examined by digital image analysis. The following two xenograft models were investigated: (1) mice carrying squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu) xenografts (ntumor = 13) were treated with afatinib or erlotinib, and (2) sarcoma (A673) xenograft bearing mice (ntumor = 8) received sorafenib treatment. MALDI drug imaging revealed a heterogeneous distribution of all anticancer drugs. The tumor regions containing high drug levels were associated with a higher degree of vascularization than the regions without drug signals (p < 0.05). When correlating the impact of blood vessel size to drug abundance in the sarcoma model, a higher amount of small vessels was detected in the tumor regions with high drug levels compared to the tumor regions with low drug levels (p < 0.05).

Here we demonstrate an electrochemical approach, named the cell electrochemical detachment (CED) technique, to form an integral endothelium and use it to prevascularize a collagen-\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) graft. The CED technique electrochemically detached an integral endothelium from a gold-coated glass rod to a collagen-infiltrated, channeled, macroporous \u03b2-TCP scaffold, forming an endothelium-lined microchannel containing graft upon removal of the rod. The in vitro results from static and perfusion culture showed that the endothelium robustly emanated microvascular sprouting and prevascularized the entire collagen/\u03b2-TCP integrated graft. The in vivo subcutaneous implantation studies showed that the prevascularized collagen/\u03b2-TCP grafts established blood flow originating from the endothelium-lined microchannel within a week, and the blood flow covered more areas in the graft over time. In addition, many blood vessels invaded the prevascularized collagen/\u03b2-TCP graft and the in vitro preformed microvascular networks anastomosed with the host vasculature, while collagen alone without the support of rigid ceramic scaffold showed less blood vessel invasion and anastomosis.

We selected patients diagnosed with AMMs (not cysts) using radiographic records. This search yielded a list of 80 cases. Real-time ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed in all but 5 patients without a sufficient safety range. In 89% (67/75) of these ultrasound-guided CNB cases, the diagnostic accuracy achieved subclassification. Fine-needle aspiration cytology achieved subclassification in only 10% of cases. On color Doppler sonography, 71% of lymphomas were characterized as \"rich vascular with central/crisscross collocations\" and 29% as \"avascular or localized/scattered peripheral vessels.\" However, decreased proportions of \"rich vascular with central/crisscross collocations\" were found in lung cancer (4% [1/23], odds ratio = 0.018, 95% confidence interval: 0.002-0.154, p < 0.001) and thymoma/thymic carcinoma (25% [4/16]; odds ratio = 0.133, 95% confidence interval: 0.035-0.514, p = 0.003) compared with the lymphoma group.

Immunohistochemical analysis of transplanted tissue and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of serum were validated.\nRats in the tolerance group had significantly higher amounts of \u03b22-glycoprotein, \u03b11-macroglobulin, rat-albumin, and vitamin D-binding protein, and significantly lower levels of haptoglobin compared with controls. Immunohistochemical staining of the alloskin indicated similar effects, such as up-regulated vitamin D-binding protein and down-regulated haptoglobin in the tolerance group compared with rejection controls (p < 0.05). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that vitamin D-binding protein was statistically increased (p < 0.05) and haptoglobin expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in the tolerance group compared with the controls.\nThere were significant differences in the serum proteomics between the tolerance and control groups.

We investigated a large consanguineous kindred with multiple affected individuals exhibiting variable phenotypes of abnormal vitreoretinal vasculature, consistent with the three above-mentioned conditions and compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance.

The TSPAN12 gene was previously reported to cause dominant and recessive FEVR, but has not yet been associated with other vitreoretinal manifestations. The intra-familial clinical variability caused by a single mutation in the TSPAN12 gene underscores the complicated phenotype-genotype correlation of mutations in this gene, and suggests that there are additional genetic and environmental factors involved in the complex process of ocular vascularization during embryonic development.

{"title": "The SK3 channel promotes placental vascularization by enhancing secretion of angiogenic factors.", "abstract": "Proper placental perfusion is essential for fetal exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste with the maternal circulation. Impairment of uteroplacental vascular function can lead to pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Potassium channels have been recognized as regulators of vascular proliferation, angiogenesis, and secretion of vasoactive factors, and their dysfunction may underlie pregnancy-related vascular diseases. Overexpression of one channel in particular, the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 (SK3), is known to increase vascularization in mice, and mice overexpressing the SK3 channel (SK3(T/T) mice) have a high rate of fetal demise and IUGR. Here, we show that overexpression of SK3 causes fetal loss through abnormal placental vascularization. We previously reported that, at pregnancy day 14, placentas isolated from SK3(T/T) mice are smaller than those obtained from wild-type mice. In this study, histological analysis reveals that SK3(T/-) placentas at this stage have abnormal placental morphology, and microcomputed tomography shows that these placentas have significantly larger and more blood vessels than those from wild-type mice. To identify the mechanism by which these vascularization defects occur, we measured levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor, and the soluble form of VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1), which must be tightly regulated to ensure proper placental development. Our data reveal that overexpression of SK3 alters systemic and placental ratios of the angiogenic factor VEGF to antiangiogenic factor sFlt-1 throughout pregnancy. Additionally, we observe increased expression of hypoxia-inducing factor 2\u03b1 in SK3(T/-) placentas.

Hypoxia triggers a signaling cascade with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as a key regulator. We monitored activation of the HIF pathway longitudinally in murine glioma tumors. GL261 cells, stably transfected with a luciferase reporter driven under the control of a promoter comprising the HIF target gene motive hypoxia response element, were implanted either subcutaneously or orthotopically. In vivo experiments were carried out using bioluminescence imaging. Tumors were subsequently analyzed using immunofluorescence staining for hypoxia, endothelial cells, tumor perfusion, and glucose transporter expression. Transient upregulation of the HIF signaling was observed in both subcutaneous and orthotopic gliomas. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed hypoxic regions in subcutaneous and, to a lesser extent, intracranial tumors. Subcutaneous tumors showed substantial necrosis, which might contribute to the decreased bioluminescence output observed toward the end of the experiment. Orthotopic tumors were less hypoxic than subcutaneous ones and did not develop extensive necrotic areas.

{"title": "Tumor necrosis factor improves vascularization in osteogenic grafts engineered with human adipose-derived stem/stromal cells.", "abstract": "The innate immune response following bone injury plays an important role in promoting cellular recruitment, revascularization, and other repair mechanisms. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) is a prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine in this cascade, and has been previously shown to improve bone formation and angiogenesis in a dose- and timing-dependent manner. This ability to positively impact both osteogenesis and vascular growth may benefit bone tissue engineering, as vasculature is essential to maintaining cell viability in large grafts after implantation. Here, we investigated the effects of exogenous TNF on the induction of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) to engineer pre-vascularized osteogenic tissue in vitro with respect to dose, timing, and co-stimulation with other inflammatory mediators. We found that acute (2-day), low-dose exposure to TNF promoted vascularization, whereas higher doses and continuous exposure inhibited vascular growth. Co-stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), another key factor released following bone injury, increased vascular network formation synergistically with TNF. ASC-seeded grafts were then cultured within polycaprolactone-fibrin composite scaffolds and implanted in nude rats for 2 weeks, resulting in further tissue maturation and increased angiogenic ingrowth in TNF-treated grafts. VEGF-A expression levels were significantly higher in TNF-treated grafts immediately prior to implantation, indicating a long-term pro-angiogenic effect. These findings demonstrate that TNF has the potential to promote vasculogenesis in engineered osteogenic grafts both in vitro and in vivo.

In the current work, the osteogenic properties of carboxyl-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-SWCNTs) were investigated in vivo and in vitro. When human preosteoblasts and murine embryonic stem cells were cultured on coverslips sprayed with COOH-SWCNTs, accelerated osteogenic differentiation was manifested by increased expression of classical bone marker genes and an increase in the secretion of osteocalcin, in addition to prior mineralization of the extracellular matrix. These results predicated COOH-SWCNTs' use to further promote osteogenic differentiation in vivo. In contrast, both cell lines had difficulties adhering to multi-walled carbon nanotube-based scaffolds, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. While a suspension of SWCNTs caused cytotoxicity in both cell lines at levels >20 \u03bcg/mL, these levels were never achieved by release from sprayed SWCNTs, warranting the approach taken. In vivo, human allografts formed by the combination of demineralized bone matrix or cartilage particles with SWCNTs were implanted into nude rats, and ectopic bone formation was analyzed. Histological analysis of both types of implants showed high permeability and pore connectivity of the carbon nanotube-soaked implants. Numerous vascularization channels appeared in the formed tissue, additional progenitor cells were recruited, and areas of de novo ossification were found 4 weeks post-implantation. Induction of the expression of bone-related genes and the presence of secreted osteopontin protein were also confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunofluorescence, respectively. In summary, these results are in line with prior contributions that highlight the suitability of SWCNTs as scaffolds with high bone-inducing capabilities both in vitro and in vivo, confirming them as alternatives to current bone-repair therapies.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2014-09-24", "authors": ["AntonioBarrientos-Dur\u00e1n", "Ellen MCarpenter", "Nicole IZur Nieden", "Theodore IMalinin", "Juan CarlosRodr\u00edguez-Manzaneque", "Laura PZanello"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S62538"}

However, the potential activity of Tbx5 in the epicardium itself, and the role of Tbx5 in mammalian coronary vasculogenesis, remains largely unknown.\nTo evaluate the consequences of altered Tbx5 gene dosage during proepicardial organ and epicardial development in the embryonic chick and mouse.\nRetroviral-mediated knockdown or upregulation of Tbx5 expression in the embryonic chick proepicardial organ and proepicardial-specific deletion of Tbx5 in the embryonic mouse (Tbx5(epi-/)) impaired normal proepicardial organ cell development, inhibited epicardial and coronary blood vessel formation, and altered developmental gene expression. The generation of epicardial-derived cells and their migration into the myocardium were impaired between embryonic day (E) 13.5 to 15.5 in mutant hearts because of delayed epicardial attachment to the myocardium and subepicardial accumulation of epicardial-derived cells. This caused defective coronary vasculogenesis associated with impaired vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment and reduced invasion of cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells into myocardium. In contrast to wild-type hearts that exhibited an elaborate ventricular vascular network, Tbx5(epi-/-) hearts displayed a marked decrease in vascular density that was associated with myocardial hypoxia as exemplified by hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 upregulation and increased binding of hypoxyprobe-1.

To combat angiogenesis, the tubulin cytoskeleton has emerged as an interesting target in many pre- and clinical studies. Contrarily, the actin cytoskeleton has been largely neglected as a potential drug target in angiogenesis. However, due to the development of drug resistances, new therapeutic strategies are always needed in tumour treatment. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of actin-binding small molecules is of particular interest.\nWe investigate the impact of chondramide (Ch), an actin polymerizing myxobacterial compound, on angiogenesis and underlying signalling. Chondramide treatment not only reduces the migration of endothelial cells but also the maturation of endothelial tube networks on matrigel. These observations can partly be explained by a disintegration of stress fibres due to aggregation and subsequent accumulation of actin in cellular structures known as 'aggresomes'. Chondramide treatment impairs the maturation of focal adhesions and reduces the amount of active \u03b21 integrin at the cell surface. Accordingly, signalling events downstream of focal adhesions are reduced. Thus, we observed that the activity of Src and downstream factors Rho-GTPases Rac1 and Rho is reduced upon Ch treatment. In vivo, Ch was well tolerated in mice and vascularization of a tumour xenograft as well as of the developing retina was significantly reduced.\nChondramide diminishes angiogenesis via two ways: (i) the disintegration of stress fibres and (ii) the reduction of promigratory signals.

They have a low incidence (0.6%), are generally benign, have a poorly defined etiology, and multiple factors have been associated with their origin. Humans and other species living at high altitudes (>2000 m above sea level) are subjected to a relatively chronic hypoxia and there is a high prevalence of the development of carotid body hyperplasia and eventually paragangliomas. This disease is usually seen in patients in their 50s and in their 30s if there is a family history.\nWe present the case of a 16 year-old female with acute pharyngitis and growing tumor located on the left side of the neck, without symptoms. A duplex Doppler ultrasound showed a solid nodular lesion on the left carotid bifurcation. A left lateral cervicotomy was performed, finding a highly vascularized tumor of 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cm involving the common carotid from its middle third, the internal carotid up to the cranial base, and the external carotid to its upper third, and intimately related to the trachea, esophagus and cervical spine.

Our aim was to develop a new approach for tumor-specific drug delivery with monoclonal antibody targeting of endothelial ligands. CD146, a molecule expressed on the endothelial surface of hepatocellular carcinoma, was identified as a promising candidate for targeting. In the present study, endothelial cells immediately captured circulating anti-CD146 (ME-9F1) antibody, while antibody binding in tumors was significantly higher than in hepatic endothelium. Macroscopically, after intravenous injection, there were no differences in the mean accumulation of anti-CD146 antibody in tumor compared to liver tissue , due to a compensating higher blood vessel density in the liver tissue. Additional blockade of nontumoral epitopes and intra-arterial administration, improved selective antibody capture in the tumor microvasculature and largely prevented antibody distribution in the lung and liver. The potential practical use of this approach was demonstrated by imaging of radionuclide-labeled ME-9F1 antibody, which showed excellent tumor-selective uptake.

Because of altered anatomy of dysplastic hips, THA in these patients represents technically demanding procedure. Distorted anatomy of the acetabulum and proximal femur together with conjoined leg length discrepancy present major challenges during performing THA in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip. In addition, most patients are at younger age, therefore, soft tissue balance is of great importance (especially the need to preserve the continuity of abductors) to maximise postoperative functional result. In this paper we present a variety of surgical techniques available for THA in dysplastic hips, their advantages and disadvantages. For acetabular reconstruction following techniques are described: Standard metal augments (prefabricated), Custom made acetabular augments (3D printing), Roof reconstruction with vascularized fibula, Roof reconstruction with pedicled iliac graft, Roof reconstruction with autologous bone graft, Roof reconstruction with homologous bone graft, Roof reconstruction with auto/homologous spongious bone, Reinforcement ring with the hook in combination with autologous graft augmentation, Cranial positioning of the acetabulum, Medial protrusion technique (cotyloplasty) with chisel, Medial protrusion technique (cotyloplasty) with reaming, Cotyloplasty without spongioplasty. For femoral reconstruction following techniques were described: Distraction with external fixator, Femoral shortening through a modified lateral approach, Transtrochanteric osteotomies, Paavilainen osteotomy, Lesser trochanter osteotomy, Double-chevron osteotomy, Subtrochanteric osteotomies, Diaphyseal osteotomies, Distal femoral osteotomies. At the end we present author's treatment method of choice: for acetabulum we perform cotyloplasty leaving only paper-thin medial wall, which we break during acetabular cup impacting. For femoral side first we peel of all rotators and posterior part of gluteus medius and vastus lateralis from greater trochanter on the very thin flake of bone.

{"title": "Complications of hip fractures: A review.", "abstract": "Nowadays, fracture surgery represents a big part of the orthopedic surgeon workload, and usually has associated major clinical and social cost implications. These fractures have several complications. Some of these are medical, and other related to the surgical treatment itself. Medical complications may affect around 20% of patients with hip fracture. Cognitive and neurological alterations, cardiopulmonary affections (alone or combined), venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, urinary tract complications, perioperative anemia, electrolytic and metabolic disorders, and pressure scars are the most important medical complications after hip surgery in terms of frequency, increase of length of stay and perioperative mortality. Complications arising from hip fracture surgery are fairly common, and vary depending on whether the fracture is intracapsular or extracapsular. The main problems in intracapsular fractures are biological: vascularization of the femoral head, and lack of periosteum -a major contributor to fracture healing- in the femoral neck. In extracapsular fractures, by contrast, the problem is mechanical, and relates to load-bearing. Early surgical fixation, the role of anti-thromboembolic and anti-infective prophylaxis, good pain control at the perioperative, detection and management of delirium, correct urinary tract management, avoidance of malnutrition, vitamin D supplementation, osteoporosis treatment and advancement of early mobilization to improve functional recovery and falls prevention are basic recommendations for an optimal maintenance of hip fractured patients.", "journal": "World journal of orthopedics", "date": "2014-09-19", "authors": ["PedroCarpintero", "Jose Ram\u00f3nCaeiro", "Roc\u00edoCarpintero", "AngelaMorales", "SamuelSilva", "ManuelMesa"], "doi": "10.5312/wjo.v5.i4.402"}

This is of utmost importance for cardiac tissue engineering, since cardiomyocytes are extremely sensitive to malnutrition and hypoxia in vitro and after implantation. To develop a perfusable myocardial patch, we have focused on seeding a decellularized biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) with endothelial cells. BioVaM is produced by decellularization of porcine small intestinal segments with preserved arterial and venous pedicles, which can be connected to a perfusion system in vitro or the host vasculature in vivo. The BioVaM vessel bed was re-seeded with porcine primary endothelial cells (pCEC). Seeding efficiency was influenced by detergent composition used for decellularization (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and/or Triton X-100) and the medium composition used for re-seeding. After decellularization, residual SDS was detected in the matrix affecting the survival of pCEC which showed a low tolerance to SDS and Triton X-100. Sensitivity to detergents was attenuated by supplementation of the medium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or fetal calf serum (FCS). Pre-conditioning of the BioVaM with 20% FCS was not sufficient to attain pCEC survival in the vascular bed. However, re-cellularization was achieved by prolonged FCS supplementation during cultivation, resulting in a perfusable, re-endothelialized matrix of 11 cm2 in size.

Methods. This study is a retrospective analysis of 28 oromandibular cancer cases that required reconstructive surgery between January 1999 and December 2011 at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan. All cases were classified using Hashikawa's CAT and Eichner's classification methods.

Complications after mandibular reconstruction occurred in 10/28 patients (36%). Specifically, five patients had plate fractures, four had plate exposures, and one had an infection. Radiation therapy and closure without any flaps were significantly related to infection or plate exposure. The wrap-around technique of securing reconstruction plates was used in 14 cases, whereas the run-through technique was used in two cases. Conclusions.

In this study, we developed a dual-phase tissue construct consisting of osteogenic (Osteo) and vasculogenic (Vasculo) components. A modular tissue engineering approach was used to create collagen/fibrin/hydroxyapatite (COL/FIB/HA) hydrogel microbeads containing embedded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSC). These microbeads were predifferentiated toward the osteogenic lineage in vitro for 14 days, and they were then embedded within a COL/FIB vasculogenic phase containing a coculture of undifferentiated bmMSC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro studies demonstrated homogenous dispersion of microbeads within the outer phase, with endothelial network formation around the microbeads over 14 days in the coculture conditions. Subcutaneous injection into immunodeficient mice was used to investigate the ability of dual-phase (Osteo+Vasculo) and control (Osteo, Vasculo, Blank) constructs to form neovasculature and ectopic bone. Laser Doppler imaging demonstrated blood perfusion through all constructs at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postimplantation. Histological quantification of total vessel density showed no significant differences between the conditions. Microcomputed tomography indicated significantly higher ectopic bone volume (BV) in the Osteo condition at 4 weeks. At 8 weeks both the Osteo and Blank groups exhibited higher BV compared to the Vasculo and dual Osteo+Vasculo groups. These data not only show that osteogenic microbeads can be used to induce ectopic bone formation, but also suggest an inhibitory effect on BV when undifferentiated bmMSC and HUVEC were included in dual-phase constructs.

In patients with melanoma (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n = 23), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 21), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 30), serum IL8 concentrations correlated with tumor burden and stage, survival (melanoma, n = 16; RCC, n = 23; HCC, n = 33), and objective responses to therapy, including those to BRAF inhibitors (melanoma, n = 16) and immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (melanoma, n = 8). IL8 concentrations in urine (n = 18) were mainly elevated in tumors with direct contact with the urinary tract.\nIL8 levels correlate with tumor burden in preclinical models and in patients with cancer.

Vascularized tissue, commonly the nasoseptal flap, is the most effective option for large defects or high flow leaks. In cases where the septum cannot be used, a mucoperiosteal flap from the nasal floor, pedicled from the sphenopalatine artery, is a viable option without reported outcomes. The aim of this work was to describe this flap and to report successful outcomes in a cohort of patients.\nRetrospective chart review of patients seen by the senior author from 2011 to 2013 requiring skull base reconstruction for defects with cerebrospinal fluid leak.\nA total of 108 patients underwent endoscopic skull base reconstruction. Ten patients had reconstruction with use of a pedicled nasal floor flap. Mean age was 53.3 years. Defects involved the ethmoid roof in 5 patients, sellar floor in 2, clivus in 2, and planum sphenoidale in 1. Reasons why the septal flap could not be used were intentional sacrifice due to disease involvement, sacrifice for proper exposure, or previous septal perforation. Mean length of follow-up was 10.2 (range, 4 to 25) months. No patient developed cerebrospinal fluid leaks postoperatively.\nNasal floor pedicled flaps are an effective alternative to nasoseptal flaps for reconstruction of the skull base, and have not been previously described in the literature. Outcomes are promising in our small cohort of patients.

{"title": "Humidified microcontact printing of proteins: universal patterning of proteins on both low and high energy surfaces.", "abstract": "Microcontact printing (\u03bcCP) of proteins is widely used for biosensors and cell biology but is constrained to printing proteins adsorbed to a low free energy, hydrophobic surface to a high free energy, hydrophilic surface. This strongly limits \u03bcCP as harsh chemical treatments are required to form a high energy surface. Here, we introduce humidified \u03bcCP (H\u03bcCP) of proteins which enables universal printing of protein on any smooth surface. We found that by flowing water in proximity to proteins adsorbed on a hydrophilized stamp, the water vapor diffusing through the stamp enables the printing of proteins on both low and high energy surfaces. Indeed, when proteins are printed using stamps with increasing spacing between water-filled microchannels, only proteins adjacent to the channels are transferred. The vapor transport through the stamp was modeled, and by comparing the humidity profiles with the protein patterns, 88% relative humidity in the stamp was identified as the threshold for H\u03bcCP. The molecular forces occurring between PDMS, peptides, and glass during printing were modeled ab initio to confirm the critical role water plays in the transfer. Using H\u03bcCP, we introduce straightforward protocols to pattern multiple proteins side-by-side down to nanometer resolution without the need for expensive mask aligners, but instead exploiting self-alignment effects derived from the stamp geometry. Finally, we introduce vascularized H\u03bcCP stamps with embedded microchannels that allow printing proteins as arbitrary, large areas patterns with nanometer resolution.

{"title": "Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for pancreas and pancreas with kidney transplant recipients.", "abstract": "Pancreas or kidney-pancreas transplantation improves survival and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and kidney failure. Immunosuppression after transplantation is associated with complications. Steroids have adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia, increase risk of infection, obesity, cataracts, myopathy, bone metabolism alterations, dermatologic problems and cushingoid appearance. Whether avoiding steroids changes outcomes is unclear.\nWe aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of steroid early withdrawal (treatment for less than 14 days after transplantation), late withdrawal (after 14 days after transplantation) or steroid avoidance in patients receiving a pancreas (including a vascularized organ) alone (PTA), simultaneous with a kidney (SPK) or after kidney transplantation (PAK).\nWe searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 June 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator. We handsearched: reference lists of nephrology textbooks, relevant studies, recent publications and clinical practice guidelines; abstracts from international transplantation society scientific meetings; and sent emails and letters seeking information about unpublished or incomplete studies to known investigators.\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies of steroid avoidance (including early withdrawal) versus steroid maintenance or versus late withdrawal in pancreas or pancreas with kidney transplant recipients. We defined steroid avoidance as complete avoidance of steroid immunosuppression, early steroid withdrawal as steroid treatment for less than 14 days after transplantation and late withdrawal as steroid withdrawal after 14 days after transplantation.\nTwo authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts, and where necessary the full text reports to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Authors of included studies were contacted to obtain missing information. Statistical analyses were performed using random effects models and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Cohort studies were not meta-analysed, but their findings summarised descriptively.\nThree RCTs enrolling 144 participants met our inclusion criteria. Two compared steroid avoidance versus late steroid withdrawal and one compared late steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance. All studies included SPK and only one also included PTA. All studies had an overall moderate risk of bias and presented only short-term results (six to 12 months). Two studies (89 participants) compared steroid avoidance or early steroid withdrawal versus late steroid withdrawal. There was no clear evidence of an impact on mortality (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 12.75), risk of kidney loss censored for death (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.09), risk of pancreas loss censored for death (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.04), or acute kidney rejection (1 study, 49 participants: RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.20 to 21.50), however results were uncertain and consistent with no difference or important benefit or harm of steroid avoidance/early steroid withdrawal. The study that compared late steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance observed no deaths, no graft loss or acute kidney rejection at six months in either group and reported uncertain effects on acute pancreas rejection (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.35). Of the possible adverse effects only infection was reported by one study. There were significantly more UTIs reported in the late withdrawal group compared to the steroid avoidance group (1 study, 25 patients: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66).We also identified 13 cohort studies and one RCT which randomised tacrolimus versus cyclosporin. These studies in general showed that steroid-sparing and withdrawal strategies had benefits in lowering HbAc1 and risk of infections (BK virus and CMV disease) and improved blood pressure control without increasing the risk of rejection. However, two studies found an increased incidence of acute pancreas rejection (HR 2.8, 95% CI 0.89 to 8.81, P = 0.066 in one study and 43.3% in the steroid withdrawal group versus 9.3% in the steroid maintenance, P < 0.05 at three years in the other) and one study found an increased incidence of acute kidney rejection (18.7% in the steroid withdrawal group versus 2.8% in the steroid maintenance, P < 0.05) at three years.\nThere is currently insufficient evidence for the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal in pancreas transplantation in the three RCTs (144 patients) identified. The results showed uncertain results for short-term risk of rejection, mortality, or graft survival in steroid-sparing strategies in a very small number of patients over a short period of follow-up. Overall the data was sparse, so no firm conclusions are possible.

We propose a new approach for reconstruction of vascular network, which determines how vessel bifurcations distribute red blood cells (RBC) in the microcirculation. Our method follows the foundational premise of Murray's law in postulating the existence of functional optimality of such networks. It accounts for the non-Newtonian behavior of blood by allowing the apparent blood viscosity to vary with discharge hematocrit and vessel radius. The optimality criterion adopted in our approach is the physiological cost of supplying oxygen to the tissue surrounding a blood vessel. Bifurcation asymmetry is expressed in terms of the amount of oxygen consumption associated with the respective tissue volumes being supplied by each daughter vessel. The vascular networks constructed with our approach capture a number of physiological characteristics observed in in vivo studies. These include the nonuniformity of wall shear stress in the microcirculation, the significant increase in pressure gradients in the terminal sections of the network, the nonuniformity of both the hematocrit partitioning at vessel bifurcations and hematocrit across the capillary bed, and the linear relationship between the RBC flux fraction and the blood flow fraction at bifurcations.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

A bioabsorbable sheet composed of poly-L-lactide copolymer (45 wt%) and \u03b5-caprolactone (45 wt%) layered with polyglycolic acid (10 wt%) was sutured intrapleurally on the parietal pleura to cover the defect on the left, but not placed on the right side as a control.

{"title": "Prophylactic administration of Amifostine protects vessel thickness in the setting of irradiated bone.", "abstract": "Although often beneficial in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), radiation therapy (XRT) leads to the depletion of vascular supply and eventually decreased perfusion of the tissue. Specifically, previous studies have demonstrated the depletion of vessel volume fraction (VVF) and vessel thickness (VT) associated with XRT. Amifostine (AMF) provides protection from the detrimental effects of radiation damage, allowing for reliable post-irradiation fracture healing in the murine mandible. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic ability of AMF to protect the vascular network in an irradiated field. Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a017) were divided into 3 groups: control (C, n\u00a0=\u00a05), radiated (XRT, n\u00a0=\u00a07), and radiated mandibles treated with Amifostine (AMF XRT, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Both groups receiving radiation underwent a previously established, human equivalent dose of XRT totaling 35\u00a0Gy, equally fractionated over 5 days. The AMF XRT group received a weight dependent (0.5\u00a0mg AMF/5\u00a0g body weight) subcutaneous injection of AMF 45\u00a0min prior to XRT. Following a 56-day recovery period, mandibles were perfused, dissected, and imaged with \u03bcCT. ANOVA was used for comparisons between groups and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. Stereologic analysis demonstrated a significant and quantifiable restoration of VT in AMF treated mandibles as compared to those treated with radiation alone (0.061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011\u00a0mm versus 0.042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). Interestingly, further analysis demonstrated no significant difference in VT between control mandibles and those treated with AMF (0.067\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016\u00a0mm versus 0.061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.633). AMF treatment also showed an increase in VVF, however those results were not statistically significant from VVF values demonstrated by the XRT group. Our data support the contention that AMF therapy acts prophylactically to protect vessel thickness.

The changes in meniscus vascularization observed during growth suggest that the tissue-specific composition may be the result of a maturation process.

To this purpose, menisci were collected from young and adult pigs and divided into different zones.

In study 2, the menisci were sectioned into the inner, the intermediate and the outer zones to determine the variations in the cell phenotype along with the inner-outer direction, through gene expression analysis. According to the results, the swine meniscus is characterized by an increasing enrichment in the cartilaginous component with age, with an increasing deposition in the anterior horn (GAGs and collagen 2; P < 0.01 both); moreover, this cartilaginous matrix strongly increases in the inner avascular and intermediate zone, as a consequence of a specific differentiation of meniscal cells towards a cartilaginous phenotype (collagen 2, P < 0.01).

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy improves nerve regeneration in a model of obstetric brachial plexus palsy.", "abstract": "The treatment of obstetric brachial plexus palsy has been limited to conservative therapies and surgical reconstruction of peripheral nerves. In addition to the damage of the brachial plexus itself, it also leads to a loss of the corresponding motoneurons in the spinal cord, which raises the need for supportive strategies that take the participation of the central nervous system into account. Based on the protective and regenerative effects of VEGF on neural tissue, our aim was to analyse the effect on nerve regeneration by adenoviral gene transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in postpartum nerve injury of the brachial plexus in rats. In the present study, we induced a selective crush injury to the left spinal roots C5 and C6 in 18 rats within 24 hours after birth and examined the effect of VEGF-gene therapy on nerve regeneration. For gene transduction an adenoviral vector encoding for VEGF165 (AdCMV.VEGF165) was used. In a period of 11 weeks, starting 3 weeks post-operatively, functional regeneration was assessed weekly by behavioural analysis and force measurement of the upper limb. Morphometric evaluation was carried out 8 months post-operatively and consisted of a histological examination of the deltoid muscle and the brachial plexus according to defined criteria of degeneration. In addition, atrophy of the deltoid muscle was evaluated by weight determination comparing the left with the right side. VEGF expression in the brachial plexus was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore the motoneurons of the spinal cord segment C5 were counted comparing the left with the right side. On the functional level, VEGF-treated animals showed faster nerve regeneration. It was found less degeneration and smaller mass reduction of the deltoid muscle in VEGF-treated animals. We observed significantly less degeneration of the brachial plexus and a greater number of surviving motoneurons (P < 0\u00b705) in the VEGF group. The results of this study confirmed the positive effect of VEGF-gene therapy on regeneration and survival of nerve cells. We could demonstrate a significant improvement on the motor-functional as well as on the histomorphological level. However, increased vascularization of the nerve tissue caused by VEGF does not seem to be the major reason for these effects.

In experiment 1, the CL size and blood flow were accessed by Doppler ultrasonography, and the PBMCs were isolated on Days 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 45, and 60 post-timed artificial insemination (TAI) from pregnant (n = 10) and nonpregnant cows (n = 12). The abundance of ISG (OAS1, MX1, MX2, and ISG15) transcripts was measured by quantitative PCR. Analyses of OAS1 and MX2 expression in isolated PBMCs (ISG-PBMC method) and Doppler imaging of CL (Doppler-US method) were performed to test the accuracy of these methods for the diagnosis of pregnancy on Day 20 post-TAI (n = 110; experiment 2). In experiment 1, the luteal volume and blood flow were reduced in nonpregnant cows during the first weeks post-TAI, but an evaluation of CL vascularization and size was efficient in identifying nonpregnant cows on Day 20 post-TAI. The expression of ISGs in PBMCs can be stimulated by the presence of a viable conceptus between Days 15 and 22 post-TAI, and the expression of these genes reaches a peak on Day 20. In experiment 2, the Doppler-US and ISG-PBMC methods resulted in similar specificity (85.5 and 87.7%, respectively). However, only the Doppler-US method resulted in 100% sensitivity. In conclusion, the greatest abundance of ISGs in PBMCs and a high detection of luteolysis by Doppler imaging on Day 20 post-TAI can be feasibly used for the earlier detection of nonpregnant cows in reproductive programs. The level of accuracy for our described pregnancy methods is high on Day 20 (80%-91%), but only the Doppler imaging method results in an absence of false-negative diagnoses.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2014-09-12", "authors": ["GuilhermePugliesi", "Bruna TMiagawa", "Yasmin NPaiva", "Moana RFran\u00e7a", "Luciano ASilva", "MarioBinelli"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.114.121525"}

The tumor occurred in the head and neck (n = 2), and lumbar regions (n = 1).Histologically, they were composed of ovoid, short spindled to polygonal mesenchymal cells with less eosinophilic cytoplasm, or vacuolated cytoplasm. There was mild nuclear atypia with mitotic activity of 0-2/10 HPF.In most areas, the neoplastic cells showed a diffuse growth pattern, whereas in some areas, they formed a vaguely nodular pattern with peripheral collagenized stroma. They were embedded in a myxoid stroma that contained a rich delicate vascular network. Besides, small cyst-like spaces were also present in one case. The tumor cells expressed vimentin, but not alpha smooth muscle actin, desmin, myogenin, S-100 protein, CD34 and cytokeratin. The patients underwent surgery.One patient had local recurrences twice and died 2 years later. Compared with the primary tumor, the recurrent lesions exhibited increased cellularity, marked cellular atypia and mitotic activity (10/10 HPF). The other two patients remained well with no evidence of disease at last during follow-up.\nPMMTI is a rare soft tissue tumor of infancy, composed of primitive mesenchymal cells and myxoid stroma.It occurs mainly in the somatic soft tissues of the trunk, head and neck region, and the extremities, and is characterized by a high rate of local recurrence if incompletely excised.

{"title": "Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation leads to high progesterone and estradiol levels during early pregnancy.", "abstract": "Are there differences in estrogen and progesterone secretion in singleton pregnancies, up to Week 11, between spontaneous pregnancies, after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and fresh embryo transfer (COH + ET) and after frozen embryo transfer in a spontaneous cycle (FET)?\nSerum progesterone and estradiol (E2) concentrations after COH + ET were higher in early pregnancy, lasting up to Week 7-8, than FET and spontaneous pregnancies, while hormone levels after FET did not differ from spontaneous pregnancies.\nThe risk of adverse perinatal outcomes after COH + ET seems to be increased when compared with spontaneous pregnancies. One of the reasons suggested for this is related to ovarian hyperstimulation.\nThis was a prospective cohort study consisting of three different groups of pregnant women which were followed-up weekly until Week 11 of their pregnancies. The spontaneous pregnancy group consisted of 41 women, the COH + ET group consisted of 39 and the FET group consisted of 30 women.\nWomen in the control group with spontaneous conception were recruited from local prenatal clinics. Women in the COH + ET and FET groups were recruited from the Reproductive Unit of Oulu University Hospital. At each visit, a three-dimensional ultrasonography was performed to examine the ovarian volumes and vascularization. A blood sample was drawn to analyse progesterone and E2 levels. The pregnancy outcome was included in the analysis.\nAt pregnancy Week 5, the serum progesterone levels were higher after the COH + ET (median 312, inter-quartile range 183-480 nmol/l), when compared with the spontaneous (63, 52-80 nmol/l; P < 0.001) and FET (74, 48-96 nmol/l; P < 0.001) pregnancies. At Week 11, the P (189, 124-260 nmol/l) was still higher in the COH + ET group (FET 101, 78-120 nmol/l, P < 0.001; spontaneous 115, 80-139 nmol/l, P < 0.01) than the other two groups. The E2 levels at Week 5 were also significantly higher after COH + ET (4.1, 2.2-6.6 nmol/l) than in the spontaneous pregnancies (1.1, 0.7-1.6 nmol/l, P < 0.001) or after FET (0.7, 0.6-0.9 nmol/l, P < 0.001). The volume of the ovaries and the intraovarian vasculature in the COH + ET group were significantly higher when compared with the other two groups (P < 0.001). The birthweight was negatively correlated with the serum P (R -0.340, P < 0.01) and E2 (R= -0.275, P < 0.05) in pregnancy Weeks 5-8. In the multivariate analysis evaluating the factors affecting birthweight of the newborn, the significant factors were the length of gestation, maternal height and progesterone or E2 secretion during Weeks 5-8.\nBecause of the low number of patients in this study, larger cohort studies are required to confirm the findings.\nThe findings here indicate that COH-induced increased luteal activity should be evaluated by measuring steroid levels or the ovarian size or vascularity, rather than number of oocytes retrieved. If unphysiologically high steroid activity during pregnancy after COH contributes to the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes after fresh embryo transfer, milder stimulation protocols or even freezing of all of the embryos should be considered.\nThis study was supported by a research grant from the Academy of Finland.

This study investigates the possible use of a collagen-chitosan sponge scaffold encapsulated with thymosin beta 4 (CCSS-eT\u03b24), an angiogenic factor, to accelerate cutaneous wound healing in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with hindlimb ischemia. CCSSs-eT\u03b24 was fabricated using a freeze-drying method. The scaffolds were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, swelling and degradation assays, mechanical properties, and scaffolds of 50:50 collagen-chitosan were selected and applied. The controlled release of T\u03b24 from the scaffolds elicited localized and prolonged effects over 12 days, as shown by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo, CCSSs-eT\u03b24 improved diabetic cutaneous wound healing, with faster wound reepithelialization, better dermal reorganization, and higher wound vascularization. Furthermore, CCSSs-eT\u03b24 downregulated inflammatory genes and upregulated angiogenic genes in the wound tissue. Significant increases in CD31-positive endothelial cells and new vessel density were also observed. In vitro, T\u03b24 increased the migratory and proliferative activity of high glucose (HG)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Meanwhile, we found that T\u03b24 could promote HG-treated HUVECs migration and improve angiogenesis by activation of the VEGF/AKT pathway. Overall, these findings demonstrated the promising potential of CCSSs-eT\u03b24 to promote more effective wound healing and suggest its possible application for diabetic cutaneous wound treatment.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The potential of the VEGF-releasing suture material was also studied in vivo 5days after implantation in the hind limb of Wistar rats, when the histological findings were analyzed. The essential results, enhanced cell viability in vitro as well as significantly increased vascularization in vivo, were achieved using PLLA/1.0\u03bcg VEGF-coated suture material. Furthermore, ELISA measurements revealed a high reproducibility of the VEGF release behavior. Based on the results achieved regarding the dose-effect relationship of VEGF, the stability during its processing and the release behavior, it can be predicted that a bioactive suture material would be successful in later in vivo studies.

Interactions between endothelial and progenitor/stem cells are important for vascularization of regenerating tissue. Recently, self-assembling peptide nanofibers were described as a promising environment for pulp regeneration due to their synthetic nature and controlled physicochemical properties. In this study, the peptide hydrogel PuraMatrix\u2122 was used as a scaffold system to investigate the role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in triggering angiogenesis and the potential for regenerating vascularized pulp in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), DPSCs, or cocultures of both cell types were encapsulated in three-dimensional PuraMatrix. The peptide nanofiber microenvironment supported cell survival, cell migration, and capillary network formation in the absence of exogenous growth factors. DPSCs increased early vascular network formation by facilitating the migration of HUVECs and by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Both the DPSC-monoculture and coculture groups exhibited vascularized pulp-like tissue with patches of osteodentin after transplantation in mice. The cocultured groups exhibited more extracellular matrix, vascularization, and mineralization than the DPSC-monocultures in vivo. The DPSCs play a critical role in initial angiogenesis, whereas coordinated efforts by the HUVECs and DPSCs are required to achieve a balance between extracellular matrix deposition and mineralization.

Here, we demonstrated efficient regeneration of avascular elastic cartilage from in vitro-grown mesenchymal condensation, which recapitulated the early stages of chondrogenesis, including transient vascularization. After transplantation of vascularized condensed progenitors into immunodeficient mice, we used an intravital imaging approach to follow cartilage maturation. We determined that endothelial cells are present inside rudimentary cartilage (mesenchymal condensation) prior to cartilage maturation. Recreation of endothelial interactions in culture enabled a recently identified population of adult elastic cartilage progenitors to generate mesenchymal condensation in a self-driven manner, without requiring the support of exogenous inductive factors or scaffold materials. Moreover, the culture-grown 3D condensed adult-derived progenitors were amenable to storage via simple freezing methods and efficiently reconstructed 3D elastic cartilage upon transplantation.

In vitro-fabricated microtissue spheroids were inserted into the canal space of tooth-root slices and were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. Histological examination revealed that, after four-week implantation, tooth-root slices containing microtissue spheroids resulted in well-vascularized and cellular pulp-like tissues, compared with empty tooth-root slices, which were filled with only subcutaneous fat tissue. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that the tissue found in the tooth-root slices was of human origin, as characterized by the expression of human mitochondria, and contained odontoblast-like cells organized along the dentin, as assessed by immunostaining for nestin and dentin sialoprotein (DSP). Vascular structures formed by HUVECs in vitro were successfully anastomosed with the host vasculature upon transplantation in vivo, as shown by immunostaining for human CD31.

For a scaffold to perform optimally, several design considerations must be addressed, with an eye toward the eventual form, function, and tissue site. The chemical and mechanical properties of the scaffold must be tuned to optimize the interaction with cells and surrounding tissues. For complex tissue engineering, mass transport limitations, vascularization, and host tissue integration are important considerations. As the tissue architecture to be replaced becomes more complex and hierarchical, scaffold design must also match this complexity to recapitulate a functioning tissue. We outline these design constraints and highlight creative and emerging strategies to overcome limitations and modulate scaffold properties for optimal regeneration.

Our experience in oncologic and reconstructive surgery of the breast reflects us about difficult cases of breast conservative surgeries in a glandular reshaping to obtain the best aesthetic result. In this approach, the posterior glandular flap of the breast was used in specific indications. The study aims to estimate the efficiency and the tolerance of the posterior glandular flap in difficult cases of breast oncoplastic surgeries.\nWe realized a consecutive serie of 24 breast oncoplastic surgeries. We noticed 15 breast conservative surgeries of superior quadrants. The posterior glandular flap was realized in 15 cases. We used the posterior part of the breast, vascularized by musculo-cutaneous intercostal arteries to give the volume lacking in the breast. We estimated efficiency and tolerance of the posterior glandular flap than one-year operating comment, as well as the oncologic follow-up long-term.\nIn this serie of 15 cases, we did not note acute complications like infection, hematoma or cutaneous necrosis. We listed 13 cases of malignant tumors with indication of radiotherapy, and 2 cases of benign tumors. In one year, we found two patients presenting a cyst of cytosteatonecrosis (1cm and 3cm) in the site of surgery, compared to posterior flap. The glandular total average excision was 333g (30-1200). An oncologic surgical resumption was necessary in 2 cases (a case of preventive mastectomy for BRCA1, and a case of insufficient margins). We realized 12 cases of controlateral surgery at the same time for symmetry. The aesthetic result was judged at one year post-operatory: good or very good in 74% of the cases, correct in 20% of the cases, and insufficient in 6% of the cases.

{"title": "Cardiac tissue slice transplantation as a model to assess tissue-engineered graft thickness, survival, and function.", "abstract": "Cell therapies offer the potential to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Although injection of single-cell suspensions has proven safe, cell retention and survival rates are low. Tissue-engineered grafts allow cell delivery with minimal initial cell loss and mechanical support to the heart. However, graft performance cannot be easily compared, and optimal construct thickness, vascularization, and survival kinetics are unknown.\nCardiac tissue slices (CTS) were generated by sectioning mouse hearts (n=40) expressing firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein into slices of defined size and thickness using a vibrating blade microtome. Bioluminescence imaging of CTS transplanted onto hearts of immunodeficient mice demonstrated survival of \u226430% of transplanted cells. Cardiac slice perfusion was re-established within 3 days, likely through anastomosis of pre-existing vessels with the host vasculature and invasion of vessels from the host. Immunofluorescence showed a peak in cell death 3 days after transplantation and a gradual decline thereafter. MRI revealed preservation of contractile function and an improved ejection fraction 1 month after transplantation of CTS (28\u00b12% CTS versus 22\u00b12% control; P=0.05). Importantly, this effect was specific to CTS because transplantation of skeletal muscle tissue slices led to faster dilative remodeling and higher animal mortality.\nIn summary, this is the first study to use CTS as a benchmark to validate and model tissue-engineered graft studies. CTS transplantation improved cell survival, established reperfusion, and enhanced cardiac function after myocardial infarction. These findings also confirm that dilative remodeling can be attenuated by topical transplantation of CTS but not skeletal muscle tissue grafts.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["JohannesRiegler", "AstridGillich", "QiShen", "Joseph DGold", "Joseph CWu"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007920"}

The aim of the current study was to characterize the hepatic pathology leading to fibrosis and tumors in a murine model of atherosclerosis. Male apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor double-knockout mice (AL) mice were fed with a high fat and high cholesterol western diet for 35 weeks (AL mice on WD). Protein and mRNA analysis as well as micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) were performed to assess oxidative stress, liver damage, inflammation, fibrosis, signaling pathways, vascularization, and tumorigenesis. Controls were chosen to distinguish between genetically and dietary effects in steatohepatitis and associated tumorigenesis. Hepatic inflammation and dyslipidemia were increased in AL mice on WD compared with wild-type mice on WD. Uniquely, AL mice on WD showed a spontaneous development of tumors (30% of cases) and thickening of intrahepatic vessel walls. Functionally relevant underlying signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB, Stat3, JNK, and AKT were differentially regulated between AL and wild-type mice on WD. Micro-CT was capable of visualizing and quantitatively distinguishing tumor neovascularization from vascularization in non-neoplastic liver tissue. AL mice on WD diet represent a novel model combining atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Signaling pathways of liver cell damage and compensatory liver regeneration in combination with enhanced inflammation appear to be crucial for the spontaneous development of tumors in AL mice on WD. Micro-CT represents a new and powerful technique for the ultrastructural and three-dimensional assessment of the vascular architecture of liver tumors.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["MarianKampschulte", "ChristianeSt\u00f6ckl", "Alexander CLangheinrich", "UlrikeAlth\u00f6hn", "Rainer MBohle", "Gabriele AKrombach", "PhilippStieger", "YuriChurin", "SandraKremer", "ChristianDierkes", "TimoRath", "ElkeRoeb", "MartinRoderfeld"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2014.112"}

The supply of autologous pulp tissue, however, is very limited in the aged. Therefore, alternative sources of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) are needed for the cell therapy. In this study, DPSCs, bone marrow (BM), and adipose tissue (AD)-derived stem cells of the same individual dog were isolated using G-CSF-induced mobilization (MDPSCs, MBMSCs, and MADSCs). The positive rates of CXCR4 and G-CSFR in MDPSCs were similar to MADSCs and were significantly higher than those in MBMSCs. Trophic effects of MDPSCs on angiogenesis, neurite extension, migration, and antiapoptosis were higher than those of MBMSCs and MADSCs. Pulp-like loose connective tissues were regenerated in all three MSC transplantations. Significantly higher volume of regenerated pulp and higher density of vascularization and innervation were observed in response to MDPSCs compared to MBMSC and MADSC transplantation. Collagenous matrix containing dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP)-positive odontoblast-like cells was the highest in MBMSCs and significantly higher in MADSCs compared to MDPSCs. MBMSCs and MADSCs, therefore, have potential for pulp regeneration, although the volume of regenerated pulp tissue, angiogenesis, and reinnervation, were less. Thus, in conclusion, an alternative cell source for dental pulp/dentin regeneration are stem cells from BM and AD tissue.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["MasashiMurakami", "YukiHayashi", "KoichiroIohara", "YoheiOsako", "YujiroHirose", "MisakoNakashima"], "doi": "10.3727/096368914X683502"}

Cryosections were investigated by CARS imaging tuned to probe C-H molecular vibrations, thereby addressing the lipid content of the sample. Raman microspectroscopy was used as reference. Histopathology provided information about the tumor's localization, cell proliferation and vascularization.\nThe morphochemical contrast of CARS images enabled identifying brain tumors irrespective of the tumor type and properties: All tumors were characterized by a lower CARS signal intensity than the normal parenchyma. On this basis, tumor borders and infiltrations could be identified with cellular resolution. Quantitative analysis revealed that the tumor-related reduction of CARS signal intensity was more pronounced in glioblastoma than in metastases. Raman spectroscopy enabled relating the CARS intensity variation to the decline of total lipid content in the tumors. The analysis of the immunohistochemical stainings revealed no correlation between tumor-induced cytological changes and the extent of CARS signal intensity reductions.

Compared to tumors in monotransgenic WAP-T mice, tumors in bitransgenic WAP-T x WAP-mutp53 mice showed higher tumor grading, enhanced vascularization, and significantly increased metastasis. Bitransgenic tumors revealed a gene signature associated with the oncogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway (EMT gene signature). In cultures of WAP-T tumor-derived G-2 cancer cells, which are comprised of subpopulations displaying \"mesenchymal\" and \"epithelial\" phenotypes, this EMT gene signature was associated with the \"mesenchymal\" compartment. Furthermore, ectopic expression of mutp53 in G-2 cells sufficed to induce a strong EMT phenotype. In contrast to these in vitro effects, monotransgenic and bitransgenic tumors were phenotypically similar suggesting that in vivo the tumor cell phenotype might be under control of the tumor microenvironment. In support, orthotopic transplantation of G-2 cells as well as of G-2 cells expressing ectopic mutp53 into syngeneic mice resulted in tumors with a predominantly epithelial phenotype, closely similar to that of endogenous primary tumors. We conclude that induction of an EMT gene signature by mutp53 in bitransgenic tumors primarily promotes tumor cell plasticity, that is, the probability of tumor cells to undergo EMT processes under appropriate stimuli, thereby possibly increasing their potential to disseminate and metastasize.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["EvaLenfert", "ClaudiaMaenz", "ChristinaHeinlein", "KatharinaJannasch", "UdoSchumacher", "KlausPantel", "Genrich VTolstonog", "WolfgangDeppert", "FlorianWegwitz"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.29186"}

The treatment protocol was staged: (1) debridement, removing intramedullary implant and cement, PMMa as spacer and placement of a double-frame external fixator. Gastrocnemius flap was used when there was a significant cutaneous defect. (2) Removing PMMa and transfer a contralateral free fibular osteocutaneous flap. (3) Change external fixation for an internal fixation. There was no mortality associated to the treatment protocol. There were no septic complications after the first and second stages. Two patients developed deep infection after the third stage. One patient developed stress fracture of the fibular flap. All cases showed integration of the fibular bone six to eight months postoperatively. Limb shortening was 3.8cm on average. All patients were able to walk independently with one crutch.

However, the differentiation of EPCs in the neoangiogenesis of gliomas has not yet been fully elucidated. The purpose in this study was to investigate the profile of EPC differentiation in rat C6 glioma using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a non-invasive monitoring assay. To achieve this goal, we isolated EPCs from rat bone marrow and identified them by detecting CD34, CD133, and VEGFR-2, the markers of EPCs. Coexpression of Ac-LDL and UEA-1 in EPCs was also determined. To dynamically monitor the migration of circulating cells, the EPCs were labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide\u00a0(USPIO) and injected by tail vein into rats bearing C6 glioma. MRI was performed at 24, 48, and 96\u00a0h after injection. The distribution and differentiation of EPCs were confirmed by histology. We found that the USPIO-labeled EPCs appeared at the tumor periphery where a large number of CD105-positive cells appeared at 24\u00a0h after injection by using MRI scanning. Ninety-six hours after injection, immunohistochemistry and Prussian blue staining were used to observe the labeled EPCs in the tumor tissue. We found that many of the labeled EPCs were overlapped with VEGFR-2-positive endothelial cells, but not CD105- or CD34-positive cells. These results suggest that EPCs can cross the blood-brain barrier from peripheral blood and home to tumors, where they differentiate into endothelial cells, including VEGFR-2-positive endothelial cells.

{"title": "Characterization of a spontaneous retinal neovascular mouse model.", "abstract": "Vision loss due to vascular disease of the retina is a leading cause of blindness in the world. Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is a subgroup of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), whereby abnormal blood vessels develop in the retina leading to debilitating vision loss and eventual blindness. The novel mouse strain, neoretinal vascularization 2 (NRV2), shows spontaneous fundus changes associated with abnormal neovascularization. The purpose of this study is to characterize the induction of pathologic angiogenesis in this mouse model.\nThe NRV2 mice were examined from postnatal day 12 (p12) to 3 months. The phenotypic changes within the retina were evaluated by fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis. The pathological neovascularization was imaged by confocal microscopy and reconstructed using three-dimensional image analysis software.\nWe found that NRV2 mice develop multifocal retinal depigmentation in the posterior fundus. Depigmented lesions developed vascular leakage observed by fluorescein angiography. The spontaneous angiogenesis arose from the retinal vascular plexus at postnatal day (p)15 and extended toward retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). By three months of age, histological analysis revealed encapsulation of the neovascular lesion by the RPE in the photoreceptor cell layer and subretinal space.\nThe NRV2 mouse strain develops early neovascular lesions within the retina, which grow downward towards the RPE beginning at p15.

Recurrent keratitis can result in progressive corneal scarring, thinning, and vascularization. Antiviral agents employed against HSV have primarily been nucleoside analogs. Early generation drugs included idoxuridine, iododesoxycytidine, vidarabine, and trifluridine. While effective, they tended to have low bioavailability and measurable local cellular toxicity due to their nonselective mode of action. Acyclovir 0.3% ointment is a more selective agent, and had become a first-line topical drug for acute HSV keratitis in Europe and other places outside of the US. Ganciclovir 0.15% gel is the most recently approved topical treatment for herpes keratitis. Compared to acyclovir 0.3% ointment, ganciclovir 0.15% gel has been shown to be better tolerated and no less effective in several Phase II and III trials. Additionally, topical ganciclovir does not cause adverse systemic side effects and is therapeutic at lower concentrations. Based on safety, efficacy, and tolerability, ganciclovir 0.15% gel should now be considered a front-line topical drug in the treatment of dendritic herpes simplex epithelial keratitis. Topics of future investigation regarding other potential uses for ganciclovir gel may include the prophylaxis of recurrent HSV epithelial keratitis, treatment of other forms of ocular disease caused by herpesviruses and adenovirus, and ganciclovir gel as an adjunct to antitumor therapy.", "journal": "Therapeutics and clinical risk management", "date": "2014-09-05", "authors": ["Timothy YChou", "Bennett YHong"], "doi": "10.2147/TCRM.S58242"}

VASH1 ceases angiogenesis, whereas VASH2 stimulates sprouting. Here we characterized their functional role in the placenta. Immunohistochemical analysis of human placental tissue clarified their distinctive localization; VASH1 in endothelial cells and VASH2 in trophoblasts. We then used a mouse model to explore their function. Wild-type, Vash1((-/-)), and Vash2((-/-)) mice on a C57BL6 background were used in their first pregnancy. As expected, the fetal vascular area was increased in the Vash1((-/-)) mice, whereas it was decreased in the Vash2((-/-)) mice relative to wild-type. In addition, we noticed that the Vash2((-/-)) mice at 18.5dpc displayed thinner villi of the labyrinth and larger maternal lacunae. Careful observation by an electron microscopy revealed that the syncytiotrophoblast formation was defective in the Vash2((-/-)) mice. To test the possible involvement of VASH2 in the syncytiotrophoblast formation, we examined the fusion of BeWo cells, a human trophoblastoid choriocarcinoma cell line. The forskolin treatment induced the fusion of BeWo cells, and the knockdown of VASH2 expression significantly inhibited this cell fusion. Conversely, the overexpression of VASH2 by the infection with adenovirus vector encoding human VASH2 gene significantly increased the fusion of BeWo cells. Glial cell missing-1 and endogenous retrovirus envelope glycoprotein Syncytin 1 and Syncytin 2 are known to be involved in the fusion of trophoblasts. However, VASH2 did not alter their expression in BeWo cells. These results indicate that VASH1 and VASH2 showed distinctive localization and opposing function on the fetoplacental vascularization.

The objective of this study was to analyze histological features of laterally spreading tumors and compare between the granular and the nongranular types. A total of 32 cases of LSTs resected endoscopically being intramucosal tumors with no previous treatment were analyzed. The disposition of the muscularis mucosae, the vascular density, and the degree of fibrosis of the submucosal layer were determined. The outline of the muscularis mucosae in LST-NG was almost flat, but that of LST-G was wavy.

{"title": "Astrocytic and vascular scaffolding for neuroblast migration in the rostral migratory stream.", "abstract": "New neurons are continuously being added to the olfactory bulb (OB) of adult rodents that are generated in the subventricular zone (SVZ), distant by a few millimeters. Neuronal precursors have to overcome this long distance without the radial-glial migratory scaffold, in contrast to migration mode during embryonic development. The previous model explains migration of precursors from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the OB as a movement of neuroblasts along each other, ensheathed by astroglial tubes. Recent results indicate that blood vessels are suitable candidates for neuronal migration guidance in the RMS. These novel findings have changed the former concept accounting for neuronal precursor migration. The aim of our study was to map a pattern of vascularization in the RMS of adult rats and to investigate mutual relations among blood vessels, neuroblasts and astrocytes in this area. Detailed morphological analysis revealed that blood vessels in the RMS are organized in a specific manner. In most of the RMS extent, blood vessels run parallel to the outline of the migratory pathway. Interestingly, the caudal part of the RMS has a unique vasculature organization in which blood vessels create a spiral-like configuration. Chains of neuroblasts enveloped by astrocytes largely align along blood vessels. The exception is the caudal part of the RMS where neuroblasts do not follow non - parallel blood vessels. Our morphological findings suggest that blood vessels and astrocytes may cooperatively form physical substrate - scaffold for the neuroblasts migration in the RMS of adult rats.", "journal": "Current neurovascular research", "date": "2014-09-04", "authors": ["MarcelaMartoncikova", "KamilaFabianova", "AndreaSchreiberova", "JurajBlasko", "VieraAlmasiova", "EnikoRacekova"], "doi": "10.2174/1567202611666140903121253"}

Frequent outcomes are osseous defects that call for a consistent therapeutic concept adapted to the individual patient. The Masquelet technique is an additional bone reconstruction method with which to sufficiently treat initially infected long bone defects in multiple operations.

In this study we aimed to develop methods for high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging and quantification of monocytes relative to the entire coronary artery network using a novel episcopic imaging modality. In a series of ex vivo experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and CD14+ monocytes were labeled with fluorescent live cell tracker probes and infused into the coronary artery network of excised rat hearts by a Langendorff perfusion method. Coronary arteries were subsequently infused with fluorescent vascular cast material and processed with an imaging cryomicrotome, whereby each heart was consecutively cut (5 \u03bcm slice thickness) and block face imaged at appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths. The resulting image stacks yielded 3D reconstructions of the vascular network and the location of cells administered. Successful detection and quantification of single cells and cell clusters were achieved relative to the coronary network using customized particle detection software. These methods were then applied to an in vivo rabbit model of chronic myocardial ischemia in which autologous monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood, labeled with a fluorescent live cell tracker probe and re-infused into the host animal. The processed 3D image stacks revealed homing of monocytes to the ischemic myocardial tissue. Monocytes detected in the ischemic tissue were predominantly concentrated in the mid-myocardium. Vessel segmentation identified coronary collateral connections relative to monocyte localization. This study established a novel imaging platform to efficiently determine the localization of monocytes in relation to the coronary microvascular network. These techniques are invaluable for investigating the role of monocyte populations in the progression of coronary neovascularization in animal models of chronic and sub-acute myocardial ischemia.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2014-09-03", "authors": ["NazaninHakimzadeh", "Pepijnvan Horssen", "Monique G J T Bvan Lier", "Jeroen P H Mvan den Wijngaard", "CharlyBelterman", "RubenCoronel", "Jan JPiek", "Hein JVerberne", "Jos A ESpaan", "MariaSiebes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.08.019"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis revisited - role and therapeutic potential of targeting endothelial metabolism.", "abstract": "Clinically approved therapies that target angiogenesis in tumors and ocular diseases focus on controlling pro-angiogenic growth factors in order to reduce aberrant microvascular growth. Although research on angiogenesis has revealed key mechanisms that regulate tissue vascularization, therapeutic success has been limited owing to insufficient efficacy, refractoriness and tumor resistance. Emerging concepts suggest that, in addition to growth factors, vascular metabolism also regulates angiogenesis and is a viable target for manipulating the microvasculature. Recent studies show that endothelial cells rely on glycolysis for ATP production, and that the key glycolytic regulator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) regulates angiogenesis by controlling the balance of tip versus stalk cells. As endothelial cells acquire a tip cell phenotype, they increase glycolytic production of ATP for sprouting. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of PFKFB3 causes a transient, partial reduction in glycolysis, and reduces pathological angiogenesis with minimal systemic harm. Although further assessment of endothelial cell metabolism is necessary, these results represent a paradigm shift in anti-angiogenic therapy from targeting angiogenic factors to focusing on vascular metabolism, warranting research on the metabolic pathways that govern angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of cell science", "date": "2014-09-03", "authors": ["PeterStapor", "XingwuWang", "JermaineGoveia", "StijnMoens", "PeterCarmeliet"], "doi": "10.1242/jcs.153908"}
{"title": "Myeloid regulatory cells in tumor spreading and metastasis.", "abstract": "Development of metastasis is determined by both the accretion of essential changes in cancerous cells and by their communications with different stromal elements in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, inflammatory response and emergence of immune regulatory cells, such and myeloid regulatory cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and lymphoid regulatory cells (regulatory T, B and NK cells) to the tumor site have been reported to support tumor growth in addition to spreading and metastasis. Every phase of tumor progression, from its initiation through metastatic expansion, is endorsed by interaction between malignant and immune cells mediated by a number of growth factors, cytokines, proteases and other molecules that modify the tumor microenvironment. Invasion and metastasis depend on intratumoral vascularization, alterations of the basement membrane and degradation of the extracellular matrix for tumor cell spreading, invasion and extravasation into the blood and lymphatic vessels. The consequent dissemination of cancerous cells to distant tissues and organs necessitates a trafficking through the vasculature, which is promoted by further interactions with cells of the immune system, including myeloid regulatory cells. Moreover, the formation of the pre-metastatic niche and specific metastasis organ tropism is also regulated and controlled by bone marrow-derived hematopoietic immune progenitor cells, immature myeloid cells and certain cytokines, chemokines and growth factors derived from tumor and immune cells, which amend the local microenvironment of the organ or tissue to promote adhesion and survival of circulating cancerous cells. Although the potential role for myeloid regulatory cells in tumor spreading and development of pre-metastatic niche has been suggested, the concept still requires further supportive experimental and clinical data, as well as data related to specific factors and mechanisms responsible for myeloid regulatory cell functioning at malignant sites.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2014-09-03", "authors": ["Anton AKeskinov", "Michael RShurin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2014.07.017"}

The correlation between the macroscopic and the microscopic aspects of the fetal placenta vascularization together with the appearance of fibrin deposits is used to determine the pathological cause of death. Different studies suggest the hypothesis of precocious development of fibrin deposits during pregnancy, due to some immune-like reactions or due to the circulatory variations in the villous territory. The present research was realized on 467 placentas - out of 467 placentas collected in the past 10 years, 287 were from term births, 98 from premature births and 82 from abortions. The fibrin deposits in the placenta resulting from abortion can also be interpreted as alterations caused by the same circulatory variable conditions. In the therapeutic abortion, the placental fragments do not contain fibrin deposits. The correct approach of the macroscopic exam in the vascular pathology, accompanied by the recognition of the microscopic changes in the placenta, contributes to determine the cause of abortion, the premature birth or the term birth, followed by the death of the fetus and/or the mother.

Modular tissue engineering approaches have been developed to enable the bottom-up assembly of more complex tissues, including vascular networks. In this study, collagen-fibrin composite microbeads (100-300 \u03bcm in diameter) were fabricated using a water-in-oil emulsion technique. Human endothelial cells and human fibroblasts were embedded directly in the microbead matrix at the time of fabrication. Microbead populations were characterized and cultured for 14 days either as free-floating populations or embedded in a surrounding fibrin gel. The collagen-fibrin matrix efficiently entrapped cells and supported their viability and spreading. By 7 days in culture, endothelial cell networks were evident within microbeads, and these structures became more prominent by day 14. Fibroblasts co-localized with endothelial cells, suggesting a pericyte-like function, and laminin deposition indicated maturation of the vessel networks over time. Microbeads embedded in a fibrin gel immediately after fabrication showed the emergence of cells and the coalescence of vessel structures in the surrounding matrix by day 7. By day 14, inosculation of neighboring cords and prominent vessel structures were observed. Microbeads pre-cultured for 7 days prior to embedding in fibrin gave rise to vessel networks that emanated radially from the microbead by day 7, and developed into connected networks by day 14. Lumen formation in endothelial cell networks was confirmed using confocal sectioning. These data show that collagen-fibrin composite microbeads support vascular network formation. Microbeads embedded directly after fabrication emulated the process of vasculogenesis, while the branching and joining of vessels from pre-cultured microbeads resembled angiogenesis.

Invasive analysis has been extensively used to provide detailed cellular and molecular characterization of the stroke pathology and engrafted stem cells. But post mortem analysis is not appropriate to reveal the time scale of the dynamic interplay between the cell graft, the ischemic lesion and the endogenous repair mechanisms. This review describes non-invasive imaging techniques which have been developed to provide complementary in vivo information. Recent advances were made in analyzing simultaneously different aspects of the cell graft (e.g., number of cells, viability state, and cell fate), the ischemic lesion (e.g., blood-brain-barrier consistency, hypoxic, and necrotic areas) and the neuronal and vascular network. We focus on optical methods, which permit simple animal preparation, repetitive experimental conditions, relatively medium-cost instrumentation and are performed under mild anesthesia, thus nearly under physiological conditions. A selection of recent examples of optical intrinsic imaging, fluorescence imaging and bioluminescence imaging to characterize the stroke pathology and engrafted stem cells are discussed. Special attention is paid to novel optimal reporter genes/probes for genetic labeling and tracking of stem cells and appropriate transgenic animal models.

The pre-ovulatory follicle diameter at the time of treatment, ovulation rate and the first day of CL detection did not differ (P=0.3) among groups. However, maximum CL diameter was greatest (P=0.003) in llamas in the 2-dose group, and smallest in the 3-dose group. Accordingly, the 2 dose-group had the largest day-to-day profile for CL diameter (P<0.01), area of CL vascularization (<0.01), and plasma progesterone concentration (P=0.01) compared to the other groups. Interestingly, the luteal response to 3-doses of OIF/NGF during the peri-ovulatory period was not different from a single dose.

{"title": "Lack of arterial hypervascularity at contrast-enhanced ultrasound should not define the priority for diagnostic work-up of nodules <2 cm.", "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend diagnostic work-up for nodules >1cm detected during screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This implies that patients with benign conditions may undergo unnecessary evaluation and those with small nodules may be intervened too early, leading to overdiagnosis. Since increased arterial vascularization is the hallmark of malignancy, its detection by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could become the signal to proceed with diagnosis confirmation. The aim was to assess if HCCs <2 cm without arterial hyperenhancement by baseline CEUS have a benign evolutionary profile, suggesting that diagnosis and invasive treatment could be delayed until detection of an overt malignant profile, associated with increased vascularization.\nWe prospectively included 168 cirrhotic patients with a newly detected solitary nodule of 5-20mm by screening ultrasonography. MRI, CEUS and fine needle biopsy (FNB) were performed and if no confident diagnosis was obtained, patients were closely followed to rule out HCC. Final diagnosis was: HCC (n = 119), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), neuroendocrine tumour (n = 1) and benign lesions (n = 45).\nCEUS did not detect contrast hyperenhancement in the arterial phase in 55 cases (34%). Eighteen out of these 55 nodules were diagnosed as HCC. Non-CEUS hyperenhanced HCCs were more frequently well-differentiated than CEUS-hyperenhanced HCCs (p < 0.004). Fourteen patients were treated with ablation and 4 with resection. Ten (55.6%) patients experienced tumour recurrence after treatment, mostly distant, confirming their overt malignant profile.\nAbsence of contrast hyperenhancement on CEUS during the arterial phase in nodules <2 cm in a cirrhotic liver does not predict a less malignant profile. Accordingly, priority for diagnostic work-up and treatment should not differ according to contrast profiles on CEUS.", "journal": "Journal of hepatology", "date": "2014-09-01", "authors": ["AlejandroForner", "Ram\u00f3nVilana", "LuisBianchi", "CarlosRodr\u00edguez-Lope", "Mar\u00edaReig", "M \u00c1ngelesGarc\u00eda-Criado", "JordiRimola", "ManelSol\u00e9", "CarmenAyuso", "Concepci\u00f3Bru", "JordiBruix"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhep.2014.08.028"}
{"title": "Thermographic evaluation of early melanoma within the vascularized skin using combined non-Newtonian blood flow and bioheat models.", "abstract": "A theoretical study on vascularized skin model to predict the thermal evaluation criteria of early melanoma using the dynamic thermal imaging technique is presented in this article. Thermographic evaluation of melanoma has been carried out during the thermal recovery of skin from undercooled condition. During thermal recovery, the skin has been exposed to natural convection, radiation, and evaporation. The thermal responses of melanoma have been evaluated by integrating the bioheat model for multi-layered skin with the momentum as well as energy conservation equations for blood flow. Differential changes in the surface thermal response of various melanoma stages except that of the early stage have been determined. It has been predicted that the thermal response due to subsurface blood flow overpowers the response of early melanoma. Hence, the study suggests that the quantification of early melanoma diagnosis using thermography has not reached a matured stage yet. Therefore, the study presents a systematic analysis of various intermediate melanoma stages to determine the thermal evaluation criteria of early melanoma. The comprehensive modeling effort made in this work supports the prediction of the disease outcome and relates the thermal response with the variation in patho-physiological, thermal and geometrical parameters.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2014-09-01", "authors": ["ArkaBhowmik", "RamjeeRepaka", "Subhash CMishra"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.08.002"}

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sildenafil citrate, which decreases cGMP degradation, on wound healing by secondary intention.This study was performed using 25 Sprague Dawley rats weighing 200-250 grams. 4 dorsal defects were created. Four different treatment modalities which were 1% and 5% sildenafil citrate gel prepared with carbopol, pure carbopol gel without any drug in it and 0,9% NaCl solution; were applied to each lesion of the same rat. Randomly selected five rats (25 rats in total) were sacrificed on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, and 14th days; and the effect of each modality was evaluated by means of defect area measurement, histopathological examination and measurement of tissue hydroxyproline levels.Sildenafil citrate gel application decreased the defect areas in a dose independent manner starting from 3rd day and dose dependent manner after 7th day. By means of vascularization, sildenafil citrate increased vascularity starting from 3rd day.

We evaluated changes in bladder function and morphology, including vascularization, in apoE(-/-)LDLR(-/-) double knockout mice with systemic atherosclerosis but without central nervous system involvement.\nCystometry was performed in awake, freely moving 60-week-old apoE(-/-)LDLR(-/-) mice and C57BL/6N controls. The mice were sacrificed and perfused with Microfil\u00ae contrast medium. The bladder was excised, dissected and scanned by nano-computerized tomography, including 3-dimensional reconstruction. Samples then underwent histomorphological analysis.\nIn apoE(-/-)LDLR(-/-) mice cystometry revealed a significant decrease in the peak-peak interval, micturition interval, functional bladder capacity and micturition volume. However, maximum bladder pressure increased. Nano-computerized tomography revealed a significant reduction in bladder wall thickness, segment volume, vascular volume and the vascular volume fraction. Histomorphologically bladder specimens showed a thickened media of intramural vessels, activated endothelial cells and intramural inflammatory cells.\nTo our knowledge this study presents a new in vivo mouse model of nonneurogenic detrusor overactivity caused by systemic atherosclerosis. Decreased bladder wall vascularization seems to be a major factor for detrusor overactivity onset. Capillaries are rarified with reduced lumina due to thickened media.

By following the formation of tumors in homozygous TH-MYCN mice, an established mouse model of neuroblastoma, we were able to capture transformed cells prior to the formation of large, vascularized tumors in order to determine the responsiveness of cells to neurotrophic factors. We discovered that the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor is abundantly expressed in tumor cells from these mice. Furthermore, CNTF - but not nerve growth factor, brain-derived nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3, or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor - promoted neuronal differentiation and withdrawal from the cell cycle.

Relevance of these markers for disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed.\nPatients with curatively resected stage I to II and resectable stage IIIA, cN0-1 adeno- or squamous cell NSCLC, of whom fresh-frozen lung resection biopsies and pretreatment FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were available, were included in this study (n = 108). FDG-uptake was quantified by calculating total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Metabolic marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]). Patients were retrospectively evaluated for DFS.\nmRNA and protein expression of metabolic markers, with the exception of MCT4, and TLG were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, whereas adenocarcinomas were better vascularized. Adenocarcinomas had a worse DFS compared with squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.016) based on the potential to metastasize. High TLG was associated with a worse DFS only in adenocarcinomas.\nOur findings suggest that the adenocarcinomas exhibit glycolysis under normoxic conditions, whereas squamous cell carcinomas are exposed to diffusion-limited hypoxia resulting in a very high anaerobic glycolytic rate. Although squamous cell carcinomas have a higher FDG-uptake, in general regarded as a poor prognostic factor, adenocarcinomas have a higher metastatic potential and a worse DFS. These findings show that FDG-PET should be interpreted in relation to histology.

We found expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) protein in well-vascularized tumor regions as well as in four cell lines grown in normoxia, thus this pathway may be important even in well-oxygenated uveal melanoma cells. HIF-1\u03b1 protein accumulation in normoxia was inhibited by rapamycin. As expected, hypoxia (1% pO2) further induced HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels along with its target genes VEGF and LOX. Growth in hypoxia significantly increased cellular invasion of all 5 uveal melanoma lines tested, as did the introduction of an oxygen-insensitive HIF-1\u03b1 mutant into Mel285 cells with low HIF-1\u03b1 baseline levels. In contrast, HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown using shRNA significantly decreased growth in hypoxia, and reduced by more than 50% tumor invasion in four lines with high HIF-1\u03b1 baseline levels. Pharmacologic blockade of HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression using digoxin dramatically suppressed cellular invasion both in normoxia and in hypoxia. We found that Notch pathway components, including Jag1-2 ligands, Hes1-Hey1 targets and the intracellular domain of Notch1, were increased in hypoxia, as well as the phosphorylation levels of Erk1-2 and Akt. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of Notch largely blocked the hypoxic induction of invasion as did the pharmacologic suppression of Erk1-2 activity. In addition, the increase in Erk1-2 and Akt phosphorylation by hypoxia was partially reduced by inhibiting Notch signaling. Our findings support the functional importance of HIF-1\u03b1 signaling in promoting the invasive capacity of uveal melanoma cells in both hypoxia and normoxia, and suggest that pharmacologically targeting HIF-1\u03b1 pathway directly or through blockade of Notch or Erk1-2 pathways can slow tumor spread.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-08-29", "authors": ["LauraAsnaghi", "Michael HLin", "Kah SuanLim", "Kah JingLim", "ArushiTripathy", "MuriloWendeborn", "Shannath LMerbs", "James THanda", "AkritSodhi", "Eli EBar", "Charles GEberhart"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0105372"}

{"title": "Method measuring oxygen tension and transport within subcutaneous devices.", "abstract": "Cellular therapies hold promise to replace the implantation of whole organs in the treatment of disease. For most cell types, in vivo viability depends on oxygen delivery to avoid the toxic effects of hypoxia. A promising approach is the in situ vascularization of implantable devices which can mediate hypoxia and improve both the lifetime and utility of implanted cells and tissues. Although mathematical models and bulk measurements of oxygenation in surrounding tissue have been used to estimate oxygenation within devices, such estimates are insufficient in determining if supplied oxygen is sufficient for the entire thickness of the implanted cells and tissues. We have developed a technique in which oxygen-sensitive microparticles (OSMs) are incorporated into the volume of subcutaneously implantable devices. Oxygen partial pressure within these devices can be measured directly in vivo by an optical probe placed on the skin surface. As validation, OSMs have been incorporated into alginate beads, commonly used as immunoisolation devices to encapsulate pancreatic islet cells.

{"title": "Autologous fat grafting for scleroderma-induced digital ulcers. An effective technique in patients with systemic sclerosis.", "abstract": "Digital ulcers (DUs) occur in up to 50% of patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). DUs are painful, recurring and lead to functional disability. Management of DUs includes pharmacologic and local therapy, the healing process is slow and the ulcer can become infected or evolve to gangrene. Autologous fat grafting (AFG) is a technique used to promote tissues repair. We used AFG to treat DUs refractory to conventional treatment to enhance healing process.\nWe treated 9 SSc patients for a total of 15 ulcers. All 9 patients were treated with iv Iloprost. The purified fat tissue was injected at the border of larger ulcers or at the finger base of smaller DUs. The AFG was performed from 2 to 8 months since the ulcer onset.\nComplete healing occured in 10 DUs and size reduction \u226550% in 2, within 8-12 weeks. In all but 2 patients the pain improved allowing a reduction of analgesics. In the majority of the cases AFG was able to hasten ulcer healing and to reduce pain and the need of pharmacological therapy. The lack of efficacy on healing and pain reduction was observed when the ulcers were long-lasting, located on legs and with concurrent atherosclerotic macroangiopathy.\nSurgical resective treatment for finger ulcers in patients affected by SSc is fraught with morbidity and long prolonged recovery. This study introduces a novel minimally invasive approach. The procedure is safe and effective, with short recovery time and local deficient vascularization improvement.", "journal": "Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...", "date": "2014-08-28", "authors": ["M DelBene", "M RPozzi", "LRovati", "IMazzola", "GErba", "SBonomi"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0034-1376970"}

In cases of a lack of adequate maxillary or mandibulary bone, bone augmentation will be necessary. The use of synthetic bioactive bone substitution materials is of increasing importance as alternatives to autogenously bone grafts. It is well known that bone can influence muscle function and muscle function can influence bone structures. Muscles have a considerable potential of adaptation and muscle tissue surrounding an inserted implant or bone surrogate can integrate changes in mechanical load of the muscle and hereupon induce signaling cascades with protein synthesis and arrangement of the cytoskeleton. The Musculus latissimus dorsi is very often used for the analyses of the in vivo biocompatibility of newly designed biomaterials. Beside macroscopically and histologically examination, biocompatibility can be assessed by analyses of the biomaterial influence of gene expression.

Using histological and immunohistochemical methods the tissue composition was investigated.

Vessels were present in all investigated samples without a difference between the tissue from non-union and control patients. The growth factor BMP-2 was below the detection limit in all samples, whereas IL-6 and IGF-I were measured only in a few samples of both groups. TGF-\u00df1, VEGF-A and BMP-4 were detectable in the majority of the samples of both groups with a high variability in the amount but no difference between the groups. The quantity of both growth factors, BMP-7 and PDGF-AB, was significantly lower in the non-union tissue compared to the healed controls.\nThe reduced quantity of BMP-7 and PDGF-AB might be responsible for the impaired healing.

{"title": "Genome editing of mouse fibroblasts by homologous recombination for sustained secretion of PDGF-B and augmentation of wound healing.", "abstract": "Exogenous cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B, can augment wound healing, but sustained delivery to maintain therapeutic levels remains a problem. \"Genome editing\" is a new technology in which precise genome modifications are made within cells using engineered site-specific nucleases. Genome editing avoids many of the complications associated with traditional gene therapy and the use of viral vectors, including random integration, imprecise gene expression, and inadvertent oncogene activation.\nThis study demonstrates site-specific nuclease-mediated integration of a PDGF-B transgene into a predefined locus within the genome of primary mouse fibroblasts. Engineered fibroblasts were applied to splinted mouse wounds and evaluated after 14 days and 5 months for the retention of engineered fibroblasts, wound healing morphology, angiogenesis, and systemic PDGF-B expression.\nThe application of engineered PDGF-B-expressing fibroblasts enhanced wound healing compared with controls. Low-level, constitutive expression of PDGF-B was achieved without detectable levels of systemic PDGF-B. The mechanism of improved wound healing is, at least in part, the result of increased wound vascularization, as the wounds treated with PDGF-B fibroblasts had a blood vessel density 2.5 times greater than controls. After 5 months, the engineered fibroblasts persisted in the wound bed. No adverse effects were detected from the application of these fibroblasts after 5 months as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining of wounds and by mouse necropsy.\nThese data support that site-specific genome editing allows for sustained cell-based cytokine delivery. Furthermore, sustained release of PDGF-B increases the speed and quality of wound healing after a single application.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2014-08-28", "authors": ["Jenny CBarker", "Adam DBarker", "JessicaBills", "JiyingHuang", "MaryWight-Carter", "ImeldaDelgado", "Debby LNoble", "Lily JHuang", "Matthew HPorteus", "Kathryn EDavis"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000000427"}

Improving healing rates may be approached with tissue engineering and use of periosteum overlying an allograft. The present study documents gene expression in human periosteum-allograft constructs compared to allografts alone. Strips of human cadaveric periosteum (26 years, f, distal femur) were sutured about sterilized human femoral cortical strut bone allograft (54 years, m) segments. After construct incubation (M199 supplemented medium) for 8\u2009d, constructs and allografts alone were implanted in nude mice. At 10 and 20 weeks, constructs (N\u2009=\u20094, each group) and allografts (N\u2009=\u20092, each group) were retrieved and placed in RNAlater for quantitative PCR to determine expression of human- and murine-specific genes relevant to remodeling. Specimens were frozen-ground to powders and RNA was extracted, purified, reverse-transcribed, and amplified. Ribosomal protein (P0) was used to normalize sample quantities. Fold change plots were generated following statistical analyses comparing 20- to 10-week gene expression data. Allografts alone yielded no human-specific gene expression. Notable fold changes of human-specific alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, type I collagen, decorin, RANKL, RANK, cathepsin K, and osteocalcin in 20-week compared to 10-week specimens were found. Murine-specific expression of genes indicative of host mouse vascularization (RANK, type I collagen) was detected in both allograft alone and periosteum-allograft samples. Gene data confirm viable periosteum in constructs after 20 weeks. Relatively higher fold-change values of RANK, RANKL and cathepsin K indicate activities of osteoclast precursors, osteoclasts and osteoblasts involved in allograft remodeling during implantation. All additional genes of interest indicate osteoblast activity in new bone matrix formation. Gene data are directly correlated with previous and present histology work.

{"title": "Characterization, isolation, expansion and clinical therapy of human corneal epithelial stem/progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Stem cells can be defined as cells that have the capacity to self-renew and the ability to generate differentiated progeny or multiple cell lineages. True stem cells can turn into any type of cells, while progenitor cells are more or less committed to becoming cell types of a particular tissue. Human corneal epithelial stem cells (CESCs) represent a great example and model of adult stem or progenitor cells. Human CESCs have been identified to locate in the basal epithelial layer of the limbus, and thus also referred as to limbal stem cells. We would like to use the both terms, stem and progenitor cells in this chapter based on previous use in the literature for more than two decades. Although the CESCs have been identified to reside at the limbus and many stem cell markers have been proposed, there is no consensus to date regarding the definitive markers for CESCs, and identification and isolation of these cells are still challenging. Based on evaluation of a variety of proposed markers, we have characterized that the CESCs located in the basal layer of human limbal epithelium are small primitive cells expressing three patterns of molecular markers, which represent a unique phenotype of putative corneal epithelial stem or progenitor cells. Based on adult stem cell criteria and the putative limbal stem cell phenotype, our group has attempted to enrich for human CESCs through novel approaches including cell-sizing, adhering to extracellular matrix collagen type IV, and cell sorting for side population or for expression of ABCG2 or connexin 43 cell surface markers. The 5 clonogenic populations isolated from limbal epithelium and its cultures by different methods show the properties that are characteristics of adult stem/progenitor cells: 1) relatively undifferentiated, 2) high proliferative potential, 3) self-renewal. Expansion and cultivation of corneal epithelial progenitor cells have been achieved using different methods, such as limbal tissue explant culture, and limbal epithelial cell suspension co-culture with mouse 3T3 fibroblast feed layer. To avoid the use of xeno-components, two cell lines of commercial human fibroblasts have been identified that support human corneal epithelial regeneration, and have potential use in replacing mouse 3T3 cells for corneal tissue bioengineering. The concept of CESCs has formed the basis for identifying a class of blinding diseases that display features of corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency or limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), where the limbal epithelium is damaged. LSCD is characterized by persistent or recurrent epithelial defects, ulceration, corneal vascularization, chronic inflammation, scarring, and conjunctivalization (conjunctival epithelial ingrowth). Only transplantation of CESCs can restore vision. Due to an increasing shortage of corneal donors, corneal tissue engineering is becoming an important discipline that holds great promise for corneal reconstruction. CESCs and optical substrates are known to be the most important factors for corneal tissue bioengineering in regenerative medicine. Our team has recently explored the utilization of natural donor corneal stroma in corneal tissue engineering. In combination with fresh limbal epithelium containing stem cells, and the donor corneal stroma, a great source of natural optical substrate, we developed a native-like corneal equivalent construct with proliferative potential. This corneal construct provides a new clinical cell therapy for corneal reconstruction.", "journal": "Journal of stem cells", "date": "2014-08-27", "authors": ["De-QuanLi", "ZhichongWang", "Kyung-ChulYoon", "FangBian"], "doi": null}

Therefore, we investigated whether ASCs would augment a clinically relevant bioprosthetic mesh-non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix (ncl-PADM)-used for ventral hernia repairs in a syngeneic animal model. ASCs were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Brown Norway rats, expanded, and labeled with green fluorescent protein. ASCs were seeded (2.5\u00d710(4) cells/cm(2)) onto ncl-PADM for 24\u2009h before surgery. In vitro ASC adhesion to ncl-PADM was assessed at 0.5, 1, and 2\u2009h after seeding, and cell morphology on ncl-PADM was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Ventral hernia defects (2\u00d74\u2009cm) were created and repaired with ASC-seeded (n=31) and control (n=32) ncl-PADM. Explants were harvested at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. Explant remodeling outcomes were evaluated using gross evaluation (bowel adhesions, surface area, and grade), histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining), immunohistochemical analysis (von Willebrand factor VIII), fluorescent microscopy, and mechanical strength measurement at the tissue-bioprosthetic mesh interface. Stem cell markers CD29, CD90, CD44, and P4HB were highly expressed in cultured ASCs, whereas endothelial and hematopoietic cell markers, such as CD31, CD90, and CD45 had low expression. Approximately 85% of seeded ASCs adhered to ncl-PADM within 2\u2009h after seeding, which was further confirmed by scanning electron microcopy examination. Gross evaluation of the hernia repairs revealed weak omental adhesion in all groups. Ultimate tensile strength was not significantly different in control and treatment groups. Conversely, elastic modulus was significantly greater at 4 weeks postsurgery in the ASC-seeded group (p<0.001). Cellular infiltration was significantly higher in the ASC-seeded group at all time points (p<0.05). Vascular infiltration was significantly greater at 4 weeks postsurgery in the ASC-seeded group (p<0.001). The presence of ASCs improved remodeling outcomes by yielding an increase in cellular infiltration and vascularization of ncl-PADM and enhanced the elastic modulus at the ncl-PADM-tissue interface. With the ease of harvesting adipose tissues that are rich in ASCs, this strategy may be clinically translatable for improving ncl-PADM ventral hernia repair outcomes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Improved survival in osteosarcoma patients with atypical low vascularization.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is considered a highly vascularized bone tumor with early metastatic dissemination through intratumoral blood vessels mostly into the lung. Novel targets for therapy such as tumor vascularization are highly warranted since little progress has been achieved in the last 30\u00a0years. However, proof of relevance for vascularization as a major prognostic parameter has been hampered by tumor heterogeneity, difficulty in detecting microvessels by immunohistochemistry, and small study cohorts. Most recently, we demonstrated that highly standardized whole-slide imaging could overcome these limitations (Kunz et al., PloS One 9(3):e90727, 2014). In this study, we applied this method to a multicenter cohort of 131 osteosarcoma patients to test osteosarcoma vascularization as a prognostic determinant.\nComputer-assisted whole-slide analysis, together with enzymatic epitope retrieval, was used for CD31-based microvessel quantification in 131 pretreatment formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsies from three bone tumor centers. Kaplan-Meier-estimated survival and chemoresponse were determined and multivariate analysis was performed. Conventional hot-spot-based microvessel density (MVD) determination was compared with whole-slide imaging.\nWe detected high estimated overall (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.008) and relapse-free (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.004) survival in 25\u00a0% of osteosarcoma patients with low osteosarcoma vascularization in contrast to other patient groups. Furthermore, all patients with low osteosarcoma vascularization showed a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Comparison of conventional MVD determination with whole-slide imaging suggests false high quantification or even exclusion of samples with low osteosarcoma vascularization due to difficult CD31 detection in previous studies.\nLow intratumoral vascularization at the time of diagnosis is a strong predictor for prolonged survival and good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma.", "journal": "Annals of surgical oncology", "date": "2014-08-27", "authors": ["PierreKunz", "JoergFellenberg", "LindaMoskovszky", "ZoltanS\u00e1pi", "TiborKrenacs", "IsidroMachado", "JohannesPoeschl", "BurkhardLehner", "MiklosSzendr\u00f5i", "PeterRuef", "MichaelBohlmann", "Antonio LlombartBosch", "VolkerEwerbeck", "RalfKinscherf", "BenediktFritzsching"], "doi": "10.1245/s10434-014-4001-2"}

However, clinical findings alone cannot replace histological investigations and diagnosis or make them superfluous. This expertise is based on an algorithm which first differentiates inflammatory pseudo-tumors, such as ruptured infundibular cysts (atheroma) from authentic neoplastic adnexal lesions. In a second step criteria of regularity and/or chaos, such as asymmetry, irregular border, color variation and/or destruction with exulceration help to evaluate the dignity. In a third step criteria of differentiation allow the characterization of lesions varying in size from macules to papules, plaques, nodules and tumors to the subgroups of adnexal differentiation. Infundibular differentiation is characterized by comedones and is skin-colored, yellow or white and hard. Follicular differentiation notifies hair and is skin-colored, pearl-like to occasionally brown-black and variably hard. Sebaceous differentiation signifies lobulation and is yellow to skin-colored or red and soft. Apocrine lesions are reddish and fleshy. Eccrine differentiation shows either papillary reddish-brown (differential diagnosis viral warts) or skin-colored hard lesions. Multiple, monomorphous lesions are characteristic of syndromes, such as Spiegler-Brooke-Fend, Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9, Muir-Torre, and Gorlin-Goltz.One peculiarity of adnexal lesions is their potential to form cysts. Cysts with horny or hairy material are skin-colored to yellow, with glandular fluid fluctuation, a bluish character, and with illumination a Tyndall phenomenon becomes obvious, while ruptured cysts reveal an erythematous-reddish, ill-defined foreign body reaction.

While histopathologic study is the cornerstone of diagnosis of these lesions, newer radiological modalities such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion MRI have shown promise, particularly in screening patients at risk for developing these lesions. Because their detection is problematic, it is imperative that clinicians thoroughly examine tissue samples of resected meningiomas, as this may alter the patient's treatment plan and prognosis. Furthermore, as both of these neoplasms often co-occur in women with breast cancer, clinicians should be vigilant of the potential for intrameningioma metastasis when neurological involvement becomes apparent in late-stage disease.

Application of miR-7 in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay led to a profound reduction of vascularization, similar to anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib. Local administration of miR-7 in an in vivo murine neuroblastoma tumor model significantly inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth.

{"title": "Vascularized treatment options for reconstruction of the ascending mandible with introduction of the femoral medial epicondyle free flap.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the ascending portion of the mandible, including the angle, ramus, and condyle, can be a challenging surgical problem. Many treatment options are available, but no single procedure has been able to restore long-term form and function in every case. Currently, autologous nonvascularized bone grafts are the most common treatment, with the costochondral graft as the historic leader. Nonvascularized grafts can often restore vertical height and normal function but may face the challenge of long-term durability secondary to bone resorption. Emerging techniques in microvascular surgery may offer an alternative approach with the benefits of resistance to resorption and infection by maintaining a viable blood supply to the graft. Vascularized grafts may thus be used to full advantage in cases where prior surgery, scarring, disrupted vasculature, or radiation damage may compromise the long-term surgical success of a nonvascularized graft. This article reviews the literature and summarizes key points regarding nonvascularized and vascularized treatment modalities for reconstruction of the ascending mandible. In addition, we present the use of the femoral medial epicondyle free flap based on the descending genicular vascular pedicle as a novel reconstruction of the ascending portion of the mandible with minimal donor-site morbidity. Knowledge of all available options will aid the surgeon in achieving the optimal reconstruction for their patient and improve long-term outcomes.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2014-08-26", "authors": ["Cameron C YLee", "BeritHackenberg", "Eric GHalvorson", "E JCaterson"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000001192"}

The authors evaluated the possibility of innervating an acellular collagen scaffold as component of a potential prefabricated flap.\nCollagen matrix sheets were implanted around the femoral bundle of a murine model to produce two flaps on proximal and distal nerve stumps based on a flow-through model. After thirty days, nerve regeneration and integration into the collagen matrix were evaluated. The specimens were microscopically analyzed to study Schwann cell colonization and axonal integration with the matrix. Axonal count and density were assessed and statistically evaluated.\nQualitative structural and ultrastructural evaluation indicated integration, with axonal fibers merged within the collagen matrix, along with a newly formed vascular network on the proximal flap. Wallerian degeneration occurred inside the distal chamber. Axonal count and density did not show statistically significant differences between the nerve inside the proximal flap and the control side.\nInnervation of an acellular matrix can be obtained by direct nerve stump implantation. The flow-through system was relatively easy to build and reliable to provide adequate blood supply.

{"title": "An unexpected role for caspase-2 in neuroblastoma.", "abstract": "Caspase-2 has been implicated in various cellular functions, including cell death by apoptosis, oxidative stress response, maintenance of genomic stability and tumor suppression. The loss of the caspase-2 gene (Casp2) enhances oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis induced by E1A/Ras in athymic nude mice, and also in the E\u03bc-Myc lymphoma and MMTV/c-neu mammary tumor mouse models. To further investigate the function of caspase-2 in oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis, we extended our studies in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma. Surprisingly, we found that loss of caspase-2 delayed tumorigenesis in the TH-MYCN neuroblastoma model. In addition, tumors from TH-MYCN/Casp2(-/-) mice were predominantly thoracic paraspinal tumors and were less vascularized compared with tumors from their TH-MYCN/Casp2(+/+) counterparts. We did not detect any differences in the expression of neuroblastoma-associated genes in TH-MYCN/Casp2(-/-) tumors, or in the activation of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway that is involved in neuroblastoma progression. Analysis of expression array data from human neuroblastoma samples showed a correlation between low caspase-2 levels and increased survival. However, caspase-2 levels correlated with clinical outcome only in the subset of MYCN-non-amplified human neuroblastoma.

Subsequently, netrins were found to modulate various biological processes including morphogenesis, tumorogenesis, adhesion, and, recently, angiogenesis. In human placenta, the most vascularized organ, the presence of netrins has also been reported. Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of netrins in the regulation of placental angiogenesis. In this review we focused on the role of netrins in human placental angiogenesis. Among all netrins examined, netrin-4 and netrin-1 have been found to be either pro- or antiangiogenic factors.

{"title": "Regulation of blood flow in the retinal trilaminar vascular network.", "abstract": "Light stimulation evokes neuronal activity in the retina, resulting in the dilation of retinal blood vessels and increased blood flow. This response, named functional hyperemia, brings oxygen and nutrients to active neurons. However, it remains unclear which vessels mediate functional hyperemia. We have characterized blood flow regulation in the rat retina in vivo by measuring changes in retinal vessel diameter and red blood cell (RBC) flux evoked by a flickering light stimulus. We found that, in first- and second-order arterioles, flicker evoked large (7.5 and 5.0%), rapid (0.73 and 0.70 s), and consistent dilations. Flicker-evoked dilations in capillaries were smaller (2.0%) and tended to have a slower onset (0.97 s), whereas dilations in venules were smaller (1.0%) and slower (1.06 s) still. The proximity of pericyte somata did not predict capillary dilation amplitude. Expression of the contractile protein \u03b1-smooth muscle actin was high in arterioles and low in capillaries. Unexpectedly, we found that blood flow in the three vascular layers was differentially regulated. Flicker stimulation evoked far larger dilations and RBC flux increases in the intermediate layer capillaries than in the superficial and deep layer capillaries (2.6 vs 0.9 and 0.7% dilation; 25.7 vs 0.8 and 11.3% RBC flux increase). These results indicate that functional hyperemia in the retina is driven primarily by active dilation of arterioles. The dilation of intermediate layer capillaries is likely mediated by active mechanisms as well. The physiological consequences of differential regulation in the three vascular layers are discussed.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2014-08-22", "authors": ["Tess EKornfield", "Eric ANewman"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1971-14.2014\n10.1038/nature09613\n10.1023/A:1011965307612\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.005\n10.1007/BF00935720\n10.1038/nn.3426\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.061\n10.1002/cne.902220102\n10.1073/pnas.2133652100\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970101)36:1<1::AID-JEMT1>3.0.CO%3B2-V\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.036\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0134-07.2007\n10.1007/978-1-60761-938-3_2\n10.1073/pnas.1100428108\n10.1073/pnas.1011321108\n10.1007/s10439-010-9942-4\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.12.009\n10.1167/iovs.03-0587\n10.1016/j.visres.2003.11.013\n10.1167/iovs.03-0764\n10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02142-9\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.019\n10.1038/nature13165\n10.3389/fnene.2010.00005\n10.1167/iovs.10-5537\n10.1091/mbc.12.9.2730\n10.1167/iovs.03-1312\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600435\n10.1167/iovs.13-13196\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.09.061\n10.1097/01.WCB.0000141500.74439.53\n10.1016/j.mvr.2010.07.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031960\n10.1016/j.exer.2012.07.004\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.011\n10.1097/00004647-199906000-00012\n10.3389/fnene.2011.00010\n10.1083/jcb.113.1.147\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1354-05.2005\n10.1167/iovs.13-12525\n10.1167/iovs.02-0738\n10.1038/nature05193\n10.1080/10739680601072099\n10.1073/pnas.95.3.765\n10.1096/fj.99-0927com\n10.1006/mvre.1998.2086\n10.1073/pnas.222561899\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600434\n10.3389/fnene.2010.00128\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1167/iovs.12-10017\n10.1073/pnas.1006735107\n10.1167/iovs.05-1297\n10.1006/mvre.1993.1018\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3032-04.2005"}
{"title": "Goblet Cells and Mucus Types in the Digestive Intestine and Respiratory Intestine in Bronze Corydoras (Callichthyidae: Teleostei).", "abstract": "The structure and histochemical properties of the intestine in bronze corydoras (Corydoras aeneus), a stomach-containing teleost, are described, with emphasis on goblet cells and mucin types. The proximal intestine displayed a normal structure for teleosts, whereas the distal intestine was wide, translucent, thin-walled, richly vascularized and constantly filled with air, suggesting an important respiratory role. Goblet cells were common throughout the entire intestine and displayed a variable, but mainly faint metachromatic colour after toluidine blue. They were moderately coloured by alcian blue at both pH 2.5 and 0.2 and displayed no colour after periodic acid followed by Schiff's solution (PAS), but a distinct purple-brown colour after high iron diamine followed by alcian blue (pH 2.5). Together, these results suggest that the mucin in the intestine goblet cells consists mainly of sulphated proteoglycans. Further, the results from the present lectin and neuraminidase tests suggest that these mucins contain much N-acetylglucoseamines and some N-acetylgalactosamines and sialic acid, but seem to lack glucose and mannose. They also contain some galactose-N-acetylgalactosamines sequences, normally hidden by sialic acid. The distinct brush border and mucus layer on the epithelial cells in the respiratory intestine may indicate some digestive roles, such as absorption of water, ions and simple carbohydrates. As sulphated proteoglycans are tough and attract much water, this mucus may play important roles in the protection against mechanical and chemical damages and in the defence against micro-organisms throughout the entire intestine, but in the respiratory intestine it may impede significantly the oxygen uptake. However, as this part of the intestine usually contains no digesta, but is completely filled with air, frequently renewed by dry air from the atmosphere, and the main function of the mucus may be to protect the respiratory epithelium against a destroying and dangerous desiccation.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2014-08-22", "authors": ["I LLeknes"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12140"}

We evaluated the maximum length of the nerve that can be included in the flap and its vascular pedicle. In addition, we discuss its adequacy for use in early reconstruction of the facial nerve both as ipsilateral facial nerve reconstruction and as cross-facial nerve graft.\nFive fresh cadavers were used in this study. In all specimens, the VLMN and its vascular pedicle were dissected, photodocumented and measured using calipers. In addition, two vascularized VLMN were injected with a radiopaque contrast and underwent CT angiography and three dimensional reconstructions were scanned to illustrate the vascular supply of the nerve using OsiriX Software.\nThe VLMN was divided into two divisions, an oblique proximal and a descending distal, in 70% of the dissections with a mean maximal length of 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 cm for the oblique division and 15.03\u2009\u00b1\u20093.87 cm for the descending division. The length of the oblique division, when present, was shorter than the length of the descending branch in all specimens. The mean length of the pedicle was 2.93\u2009\u00b1\u20091.69 cm, and 3.27\u2009\u00b1\u20091.49 cm until crossing the oblique and the descending division of the nerve respectively. The mean caliber of the nerve was 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62 mm. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography demonstrated perfusion throughout the entire VLMN by branches from the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery which ran parallel to the descending division of the VLMN.

{"title": "Novel paracrine modulation of Notch-DLL4 signaling by fibulin-3 promotes angiogenesis in high-grade gliomas.", "abstract": "High-grade gliomas are characterized by exuberant vascularization, diffuse invasion, and significant chemoresistance, resulting in a recurrent phenotype that makes them impossible to eradicate in the long term. Targeting protumoral signals in the glioma microenvironment could have significant impact against tumor cells and the supporting niche that facilitates their growth. Fibulin-3 is a protein secreted by glioma cells, but absent in normal brain, that promotes tumor invasion and survival. We show here that fibulin-3 is a paracrine activator of Notch signaling in endothelial cells and promotes glioma angiogenesis. Fibulin-3 overexpression increased tumor VEGF levels, microvascular density, and vessel permeability, whereas fibulin-3 knockdown reduced vessel density in xenograft models of glioma. Fibulin-3 localization in human glioblastomas showed dense fiber-like condensations around tumor blood vessels, which were absent in normal brain, suggesting a remarkable association of this protein with tumor endothelium. At the cellular level, fibulin-3 enhanced endothelial cell motility and association to glioma cells, reduced endothelial cell sprouting, and increased formation of endothelial tubules in a VEGF-independent and Notch-dependent manner. Fibulin-3 increased ADAM10/17 activity in endothelial cells by inhibiting the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP3; this resulted in increased Notch cleavage and increased expression of DLL4 independently of VEGF signaling. Inhibition of ADAM10/17 or knockdown of DLL4 reduced the proangiogenic effects of fibulin-3 in culture. Taken together, these results reveal a novel, proangiogenic role of fibulin-3 in gliomas, highlighting the relevance of this protein as an important molecular target in the tumor microenvironment.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2014-08-21", "authors": ["Mohan SNandhu", "BinHu", "Susan ECole", "AnatErdreich-Epstein", "Diego JRodriguez-Gil", "Mariano SViapiano"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0685"}

We have previously shown that the oncolytic adenovirus dl922-947 induces extensive DNA damage, therefore we hypothesized a synergistic antitumoral effect of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in association with dl922-947. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was chosen as model since it is a particularly aggressive tumor and, because of its localized growth, it is suitable for intratumoral treatment with oncolytic viruses. Here, we show that dl922-947 infection induces PARP activation, and we confirm in vitro and in vivo that PARP inhibition increases dl922-947 replication and oncolytic activity. In vitro, the combination with olaparib exacerbates the appearance of cell death markers, such as Annexin V positivity, caspase 3 cleavage, cytochrome C release and propidium iodide permeability. In vivo, we also observed a better viral distribution upon PARP inhibition. Changes in CD31 levels suggest a direct effect of olaparib on tumor vascularization and on the viral distribution within the tumor mass.

In 15 patients with ORN, a mandibular segmental defect was bridged with a reconstruction plate, and the defect site was primed with a LD musculocutaneous flap wrapped around the reconstruction plate to bring in vascularized tissue and optimize healing conditions for a subsequent particulate iliac free bone graft reconstruction. The management of defect closure was successful in all 15 patients. Twelve patients had a subsequent bone grafting from the posterior ileum for repair of defects up to 14 cm length. Three patients had no bone graft for various reasons. In three patients dental rehabilitation was achieved with implant supported prosthodontic appliances. Ten patients met the success criteria of uneventful graft healing with restitution of osseous continuity, mandibular height, symmetry and function, and avoidance of reconstruction plate fracture.", "journal": "Craniomaxillofacial trauma & reconstruction", "date": "2014-08-20", "authors": ["SorenHillerup", "Jens JorgenElberg", "Jens JorgenThorn", "MikaelAndersen"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0034-1371003"}

KIF13B is shown to interact directly with VEGFR2 on microtubules. We also observed that overexpression of truncated versions of KIF13B containing the binding domains that interact with VEGFR2 inhibited VEGF-induced capillary tube formation. KIF13B depletion prevented VEGF-mediated endothelial migration, capillary tube formation and neo-vascularization in mice.

When seeded in an extracellular matrix, endothelial cells can form blood vessel-like structures, including vascular networks and sprouts. Endothelial morphogenesis depends on a large number of chemical and mechanical factors, including the compliancy of the extracellular matrix, the available growth factors, the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, cell-cell signaling, etc. Although various computational models have been proposed to explain the role of each of these biochemical and biomechanical effects, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying in vitro angiogenesis is still incomplete. Most explanations focus on predicting the whole vascular network or sprout from the underlying cell behavior, and do not check if the same model also correctly captures the intermediate scale: the pairwise cell-cell interactions or single cell responses to ECM mechanics. Here we show, using a hybrid cellular Potts and finite element computational model, that a single set of biologically plausible rules describing (a) the contractile forces that endothelial cells exert on the ECM, (b) the resulting strains in the extracellular matrix, and (c) the cellular response to the strains, suffices for reproducing the behavior of individual endothelial cells and the interactions of endothelial cell pairs in compliant matrices. With the same set of rules, the model also reproduces network formation from scattered cells, and sprouting from endothelial spheroids.

Spatial resolution was 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8 mm(3), and temporal resolution was 13.5 seconds. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently processed DCE images and measured semi-quantitative and pharmacokinetic parameters in areas of YBM and RBM. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios were calculated. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was assessed.\nArea under the curve (AUC) and initial slope (IS) were significantly greater for RBM than for YBM (p\u2009<\u20090.05). K(trans) and kep were also significantly greater for RBM (p\u2009<\u20090.05). There was no significant difference in time to peak between the regions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). SNR, CNR, and intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were all good.\nDCE study of the whole hip is feasible with high spatial resolution using a 3D T1 sequence. Measures were possible even in low vascularized areas of the femoral head.

{"title": "Mechanisms of glioma formation: iterative perivascular glioma growth and invasion leads to tumor progression, VEGF-independent vascularization, and resistance to antiangiogenic therapy.", "abstract": "As glioma cells infiltrate the brain they become associated with various microanatomic brain structures such as blood vessels, white matter tracts, and brain parenchyma. How these distinct invasion patterns coordinate tumor growth and influence clinical outcomes remain poorly understood. We have investigated how perivascular growth affects glioma growth patterning and response to antiangiogenic therapy within the highly vascularized brain. Orthotopically implanted rodent and human glioma cells are shown to commonly invade and proliferate within brain perivascular space. This form of brain tumor growth and invasion is also shown to characterize de novo generated endogenous mouse brain tumors, biopsies of primary human glioblastoma (GBM), and peripheral cancer metastasis to the human brain. Perivascularly invading brain tumors become vascularized by normal brain microvessels as individual glioma cells use perivascular space as a conduit for tumor invasion. Agent-based computational modeling recapitulated biological perivascular glioma growth without the need for neoangiogenesis. We tested the requirement for neoangiogenesis in perivascular glioma by treating animals with angiogenesis inhibitors bevacizumab and DC101. These inhibitors induced the expected vessel normalization, yet failed to reduce tumor growth or improve survival of mice bearing orthotopic or endogenous gliomas while exacerbating brain tumor invasion.

One hundred forty-three consecutive female patients were examined by using an image-processing technique. Three-dimensional FMBV fractional moving blood volume was measured on the vasculature from the uteroplacental interface to a depth 5 mm into the placenta by using a normalization volume 10 mm outside the uteroplacental interface and compared against the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ( VOCAL Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) vascularization flow index ( VFI vascularization flow index ). Intra- and interobserver variability was assessed in a subset of 18 volumes. Wilcoxon signed rank test and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to assess measurement repeatability.\nThe mean 3D three-dimensional FMBV fractional moving blood volume value \u00b1 standard deviation was 11.78% \u00b1 9.30 (range, 0.012%-44.16%).

Although the importance of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in cancer-related processes such as tumor cell adhesion, migration, metastasis and immune escape has been largely appreciated, our awareness of the impact of lectin-glycan recognition in tumor vascularization is relatively new. Regulated glycosylation can influence vascular biology by controlling trafficking, endocytosis and signaling of endothelial cell (EC) receptors including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet EC adhesion molecule, Notch and integrins. In addition, glycans may control angiogenesis by regulating migration of endothelial tip cells and influencing EC survival and vascular permeability. Recent evidence indicated that changes in the EC surface glycome may also serve \"on-and-off\" switches that control galectin binding to signaling receptors by displaying or masking-specific glycan epitopes. These glycosylation-dependent lectin-receptor interactions can link tumor hypoxia to EC signaling and control tumor sensitivity to anti-angiogenic treatment.", "journal": "Glycobiology", "date": "2014-08-15", "authors": ["Diego OCroci", "Juan PCerliani", "Nicolas APinto", "Luciano GMorosi", "Gabriel ARabinovich"], "doi": "10.1093/glycob/cwu083"}

{"title": "Reconstruction for osteoradionecrosis of the mandible: superiority of free iliac bone flap to fibula flap in postoperative infection and healing.", "abstract": "Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible is not an uncommon complication after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Although definitive treatment has been confirmed as radical excision of the necrotic bone with simultaneous vascularized osteocutaneous flap reconstruction, it remains a unique challenge. In this study, we compare our results of reconstruction with free iliac and fibula flaps in flap survival, bony union, and postoperative complications.\nFrom 1986 to 2011, there were 153 mandibular ORN cases in our center that were treated with radical resection of the necrotic bone and reconstruction with either vascularized iliac (n=108) or fibula flaps (n=45). Data collected for analysis included patient demographics, flap survival rate, postoperative infection rate, nonunion/malunion rate, mean hospital stay, and antibiotics use.\nAll patients healed eventually without recurrence of ORN. However, we observed difference in the complication rate between the iliac flap group and fibula flap group. In the group with iliac flap reconstruction, patients required less days of hospital stay for intravenous antibiotics treatment postoperatively. The average days required for intravenous antibiotics in the iliac flap group were 10.46 (2.28) versus 16.09 (3.88) days in the fibula group (P<0.01). In the group with fibula flap reconstruction, 9 (20.0%) patients had subsequent neck infection due to healing problem, compared to 8 (7.4%) patients in the iliac flap group (P=0.04). In the iliac flap group, the nonunion and malunion rates were 4.6% and 2.8% respectively; whereas in the fibula group, the rates were 15.5% and 6.6%, respectively (P=0.04 and 0.36, respectively).\nFor ORN patients, vascularized iliac bone flap provides more reliable results compared to fibula flap. The merits of vascularized iliac flap include the following: (1) its natural curve mimics the shape of mandible and does not need osteotomy; (2) it offers more volume of bone that matches better to the native mandible to allow later osteointegration as well as faster bony union, due to the nature of being a membranous bone; and (3) it carries more abundant soft tissue to obliterate possible dead space.

All patients, aged 36 to 50 years, have had one-side upper-limb lymphedema for 3 to 5 years. Six patients had accepted radiotherapy. Four patients had a diagnosis of severe lymphedema, and 2 patients had moderate lymphedema. The isotope radiography before the operation showed obstruction of lymphatic return, and the multidetector computed tomography that followed delivered a clear picture of the abdominal flap blood supply and the blood vessels in the breasts. During the operation, the scar contracture of the axilla was completely relaxed, and all patients accepted abdominal transplantation of lower abdominal flap with vascularized lymph node. After the operation, the elastic bandages were applied for one year as an adjuvant therapy. The follow-up visits were conducted 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery. The measurement indexes included mid-upper arm circumference, clinical symptoms, and lymphoscintigraphy.\nAll flaps worked well. One patient was found to have delayed wound healing; one patient saw no obvious improvement in lymphedema; 7 patients with lymphedema were relieved with apparent improvement in the affected limbs' mean perimeter and clinical symptoms; one patient recovered; and another patient was lost to follow-up. The mean reduction was 2.122\u00b12.331 cm, and the reduction of the lymphedematous limb was statistically significant between the preoperative and 12-month postoperative groups (P<0.05).

Immunofluorescence techniques were used to investigate dual-labeling of the specimens for CD68, CD163 and Ki67, respectively.\nWith immunofluorescence staining, scattered cells in all specimens were dual-labeled for CD68-Ki67 and CD163-Ki67.

The center of epithelioid-cell granulomas and foreign body giant cells was exclusively composed of M1 macrophages.\nThis study shows that CD68+ and CD163+ cells express Ki67, a marker for proliferative activity at the site of inflammation. Until recently, macrophages were regarded as end-differentiated cells without mitotic activity. Since self-renewal of M1 and M2 macrophages has been described in the literature, staining of macrophages with Ki67 may indicate proliferative activity or at least an activation state.

Most patients have acute superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion, and a large proportion of these patients will develop peritonitis prior to mesenteric revascularization, and explorative laparotomy will therefore be necessary to evaluate the extent and severity of intestinal ischemia, and to perform bowel resections. The establishment of a hybrid operating room in vascular units in hospitals is most important to be able to perform successful intestinal revascularization. This review outlines current frontline surgical strategies to improve survival and minimize bowel morbidity in patients with peritonitis secondary to acute SMA occlusion. Explorative laparotomy needs to be performed first. Curative treatment is based upon intestinal revascularization followed by bowel resection. If no vascular imaging has been carried out, SMA angiography is performed. In case of embolic occlusion of the SMA, open embolectomy is performed followed by angiography. In case of thrombotic occlusion, the occlusive lesion can be recanalized retrograde from an exposed SMA, the guidewire snared from either the femoral or brachial artery, and stented with standard devices from these access sites. Bowel resections and sometimes gall bladder removal due to transmural infarctions are performed at initial laparotomy, leaving definitive bowel reconstructions to a planned second look laparotomy, according to the principles of damage control surgery. Patients with peritonitis secondary to acute SMA occlusion should be managed by both the general and vascular surgeon, and a hybrid revascularization approach is of utmost importance to improve outcomes.", "journal": "World journal of gastroenterology", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["StefanAcosta"], "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v20.i29.9936"}

VEGF has become the main target of anti-angiogenic therapy. However, most patients relapse after an initial response or present a resistance to the treatment. Identification of new pro-angiogenic factors may help to improve anti-angiogenic therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that the pro-hormone progastrin (PG), over-expressed in CRC, recognized as a growth factor, is a potent pro-angiogenic factor. In transgenic mice and human colorectal HPs producing high levels of PG, we correlated PG overexpression with an increased vascularization. In vitro, exogenous PG and conditioned media (CM) from CRC cells producing PG increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. We also showed that treatment with exogenous PG can increase the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures. Moreover, we demonstrated that PG enhanced endothelial permeability. The finding that PG stimulated the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, p125-FAK, paxillin and induced actin remodelling was consistent with a role of these components in PG-stimulated endothelial cell migration and permeability. The pro-angiogenic effects observed with CM were significantly inhibited when CRC cells expressed a PG shRNA. In vivo, we found an important decrease in tumor growth and neovascularization when the CRC cells expressing the PG shRNA were xenografted in mice or in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model. We also observed an increase in the coverage of blood vessels by pericytes and a decrease in endothelial permeability when PG expression was blocked.

After evaluation of the material characteristics via scanning electron microscopy, subcutaneous implantation in CD-1 mice was used to assess the inflammatory response to the material for up to 60 days. The clinical aspects of this study involved the use of human bone specimens 6 months after sinus augmentation. Established histologic and histomorphometric analysis methods were applied. After implantation, the material was well integrated into both species without any adverse reactions. Material-induced multinucleated giant cells were observed in both species and were associated with enhanced vascularization. These results revealed the high heat treatment led to an increase in the inflammatory tissue response to the biomaterial, and a combined increase in multinucleated giant cell formation. Further clarification of the differentiation of the multinucleated giant cells toward so-called osteoclast-like cells or foreign-body giant cells is needed to relate these cells to the physicochemical composition of the material.", "journal": "The Journal of oral implantology", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["MikeBarbeck", "SamuelUdeabor", "JonasLorenz", "MarkusSchlee", "Marzellus GrosseHolthaus", "NinaRaetscho", "JosephChoukroun", "RobertSader", "C JamesKirkpatrick", "ShahramGhanaati"], "doi": "10.1563/aaid-joi-D-14-00168"}
{"title": "Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis for cerebral proliferative angiopathy with cerebral ischemia.", "abstract": "Cerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a rare clinical entity. This disorder is characterized by diffuse vascular abnormalities with intermingled normal brain parenchyma, and is differentiated from classic arteriovenous malformations. The management of CPA in patients presenting with nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits due to cerebral ischemia is challenging and controversial. The authors report a case of adult CPA with cerebral ischemia in which neurological deficits were improved after encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS). A 28-year-old man presented with epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography showed a diffuse vascular network (CPA) in the right hemisphere. Antiepileptic medications were administered. Four years after the initial onset of epilepsy, the patient's left-hand grip strength gradually decreased over the course of 1 year. The MRI studies showed no infarcts, but technetium-99m-labeled ethyl cysteinate dimer ((99m)Tc-ECD) SPECT studies obtained with acetazolamide challenge demonstrated hypoperfusion and severely impaired cerebrovascular reactivity over the affected hemisphere. This suggested that the patient's neurological deficits were associated with cerebral ischemia. The authors performed EDAS for cerebral ischemia, and the patient's hand grip strength gradually improved after the operation. Follow-up angiography studies obtained 7 months after the operation showed profound neovascularization through the superficial temporal artery and the middle meningeal artery. A SPECT study showed slight improvement of hypoperfusion at the focal region around the right motor area, indicating clinical improvement from the operation. The authors conclude that EDAS may be a treatment option for CPA-related hypoperfusion.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["KenichiKono", "TomoakiTerada"], "doi": "10.3171/2014.7.JNS132793"}

Despite multiple classification systems, a standardized classification that accurately identifies predictors of successful repair is lacking. In industrialized nations, genitourinary fistulae are rare and are most frequently associated with pelvic surgery, pelvic radiation, cancer or trauma. Surgical techniques to repair these fistulae have shifted from transabdominal laparotomy to minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures.

{"title": "Peptide REDV-modified polysaccharide hydrogel with endothelial cell selectivity for the promotion of angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Rapid and controlled vascularization of engineered tissues remains one of the key limitations in thick tissue engineering. Although many studies have focused on improving the rapid vascularization through the immobilization of bioactive molecules, the competition in growth between endothelial cells (ECs) and other cell types is to some extent neglected. In this study, we developed a peptide GREDV-modified scaffold for selective adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through the specific recognition of the REDV peptide and integrin \u03b14 \u03b21 . In vitro studies showed that GREDV-conjugated alginate (ALG-GREDV) improved HUVEC adhesion, migration and proliferation when compared with a non-modified group. Furthermore, ALG-GREDV exhibited a superior capability for promoting the proliferation and selective adhesion of HUVEC over that of other peptide (RGD and YIGSR) modified groups (ALG-Pep). In vivo angiogenic assays demonstrated that the ALG-GREDV scaffold induced an angiogenic potential by stimulating new vessel formation and showed the highest blood vessel density among all samples after 21 days of implanting (83.7 vessels/mm(2) ). More importantly, the blood vessel density in cambium fibrous tissue of ALG-GREDV was about 1.5 times greater than other ALG-Pep groups, indicating facilitation of ALG-GREDV on selective angiogenesis in vivo.

The authors manage reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with the temporal fascial scar tissue flap (TFSF) and the temporal periosteal scar tissue flap (TPSF) to ensure obtaining a stable posterior canal wall and a tympanic membrane graft. Well-vascularized TFSF and TPSF enable us to acquire a solid reconstructed posterior canal wall because of the secure blood supplies to the flaps. In order to investigate the blood supplies of TFSF and TPSF, we employed laser Doppler blood flowmeters and measured blood flow in the flaps in 20 cases of posyoperative ears treated for a mastoid cavity problem. The blood supplies to both flaps were good, with the blood supply to the TFSF being statistically better than in the case of the TPSF. These findings suggested that the TFSF and TPSF were a reliable source of local well-vascularized tissue which were pliable and could facilitate the creation of a stable posterior canal wall. Furthermore it seems the good blood supply was linked to the prompt postoperative healing, the avoidance of postoperative infection, and good hearing improvement postoperatively.", "journal": "Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["TakaoYabe", "KazunariOkada"], "doi": "10.3950/jibiinkoka.117.788"}

Drimys granadensis is a widespread species in montane forests of South and Central America. In this research, the structure, ontogeny, phyllotaxis and vascularization of the flowers and inflorescences of this species was studied in a population from the Eastern hills of Sabana de Bogota, Colombia. The methods used applied both optical microscopy, with astra blue-fuchsin staining, and scanning electron microscopy, using critical point dryed and gold-paladium metallized samples. Besides, results were compared with those of Drimys winteri, a widely studied species distributed in Chile and Argentina. Additionally, we studied the detail of the floral anatomy to determine the bracteal or calicine identity of the caliptra. I confirmed the proliferative status of the monothelic inflorescence, discarding alternative explanations of the terminal flower identity. I found that uniflorescences have an acropetal development until the terminal meristem becomes the terminal flower, then this flower develops rapidly resulting in a determined uniflorescence. I found pseudosyphonosthelic vascularization in peduncles and pedicels. Besides, I discovered some evidence in the vascular and anatomical structures, to consider the caliptra as the fusion product of various structures and therefore of calicine origin. The caliptra showed a whorled phyllotaxis, but the petals, stamens and carpels presented a spiral condition; phyllotaxis change was explained by the long time lapse between the initiation of the calyx and the corolla. I found great similarities among the inflorescences of D. granadensis and D. winteri; they were different in the proliferation start time, and in the frequent presence of nomophylls in D. granadensis, in contrast to the presence of reduced bracts and bracteoles in D. winteri inflorescences.", "journal": "Revista de biologia tropical", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["XavierMarqu\u00ednez"], "doi": null}

Recently, endothelial cells (ECs) or angiogenic factors such as VEGFA have been demonstrated to support development and regeneration of multiple organ systems, including the heart, pancreas, liver, lung and bone marrow. Therefore, co-transplantation of ECs derived from the same parental PSCs that differentiate into cell types of interest; or overexpression of the inductive angiogenic factors responsible for organ regeneration might be beneficial to support function of hPSC-derived tissues. In this special issue, we discuss how protein kinases (Ng and colleagues); DNA methylation and histone modification (Tsui and colleagues) regulate cellular pluripotency and cell-fate specification of PSCs. In addition, we discuss how ECs and angiogenic factors could contribute to repair and regeneration of organs such as the heart (Yuan and colleagues), the cardiovascular system (Tse and colleagues) and the pancreas (Lui). We also discuss the role of mesenchymal stem cells or paracrine factors secreted by them in tissue repair (Li and colleagues).

Better osteogenesis was observed in groups SN and VB than in group Blank, and no significant difference was found between groups SN and VB at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. The neuropeptides expression and the number of new blood vessels in the bone tissues were increased at 8 weeks and then decreased at 12 weeks in all groups and were highest in group VB and lowest in group Blank at all three time points. We conclude that implanting either blood vessel or sensory nerve tract into the tissue-engineered bone can significantly enhance both the vascularization and neurotization simultaneously to get a better osteogenesis effect than TEB alone, and the method of implanting blood vessel has a little better effect of vascularization and neurotization but almost the same osteogenesis effect as implanting sensory nerve.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["Jun-junFan", "Tian-wangMu", "Jun-junQin", "LongBi", "Guo-xianPei"], "doi": "10.1155/2014/412570"}

Their management is therefore very different from acute cerebral ischemia. It is essential to rule out giant cell arteritis in all patients with acute retinal or optic nerve ischemia.\nBecause the eye is vascularized by branches of the internal carotid artery, retinal ischemic symptoms are common in patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes.

Standardized assessment of outcomes was performed, including duration of operation, objective sensory recovery, cold intolerance, time of returning to work, active total range of motion (ROM) of the injured fingers, and the cosmetic appearance of the donor/recipient sites.\nAll flaps survived completely, and the follow-up duration was 13.5 months. The mean duration of the complete surgical procedure for AVFs was distinctly shorter than that of the other flaps (p<0.05). AVFs were employed to reconstruct skin defects and extensor tendon defects using a vascularized palmaris longus graft in 4 fingers. Digital blood supply was reestablished in 4 fingers by flow-through technique when using AVFs. Optimal sensory recovery was better with AVFs and SPBRA flaps as compared with UAPF flaps and PIPFs (p<0.05). No significant differences were noted in ROM or cold intolerance between the 4 groups. Optimal cosmetic satisfaction was noted for the recipient sites of AVFs and the donor sites of SPBRA flaps. The number of second-stage defatting operations required for AVFs was considerably lesser than that for the other flaps.\nAll 4 types of free flaps from the ipsilateral extremity are a practical choice in finger reconstruction for small/moderate-sized skin defects.

All patients were divided into two groups--the study group (n =11) and the control group (n = 16). In order to evaluate the efficacy of two different prevention schemes, the occurrence of graft rejection, rejection crises, and crisis-associated clouding of the transplant was analyzed.\nThe occurrence of transplant opacity was two times lower in the Metipred-cyclosporine group than in the conventional prevention group. Kaplan-Meier one-year survival of the transplant was 53% in the study group and 27% in the control group. Two-year survival rate difference appeared even more significant--53% and 18% correspondingly.\nIt is clinically shown that subtherapeutic use of Metipred and cyclosporine decreases the occurrence of rejection crises and transplant failure almost by half in high-risk patients as compared with topical corticosteroids; at the same time the side effects of systemic immunosuppression are not substantial. Thus, the suggested prevention scheme allows to perform keratoplasty and expect a clear transplant in children who previously were considered inoperable, i.e. with total vascularized corneal opacity, giant staphylomas, and corneal burns.", "journal": "Vestnik oftalmologii", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["A VPleskova", "A VKhvatova"], "doi": null}

We describe here an innovative use of the ischiorectal fat pad to aid in the repair of acquired rectovaginal and rectourethral fistulae.\nPatients with recurrent vaginal or urethral fistulae were selected for review. The ischiorectal fat pad was deliberately mobilized (via a posterior sagittal or transanal approach) and used to buttress the repair of the posterior vagina or urethra.\nThe ischiorectal fat pad technique was used in 9 patients. All had an acquired fistula (6 rectovaginal fistula, 3 rectourethral fistulas). We used the posterior sagittal approach in 7 and in 2 the transanal approach. Six patients had had at least two prior attempts at fistula repair. Six patients had a stoma, and 3 did not. There were no recurrences in greater than six month follow-up.\nThe ischiorectal fat pad is easily visualized and mobilized, either via a posterior sagittal or transanal approach, providing excellent coverage with native, well-vascularized tissue, in an area that is difficult to heal.

The testicles of 54 greater rhea bred in captivity were utilized. The samples were collected November 2005 (n = 14), December 2006 (n = 20) and May 2007 (n = 20). During commercial slaughter, the testicles and epididymides were collected and their following morphometric parameters were immediately measured: length, width, thickness, circumference, volume, weight of the parenchyma and the tunica albuginea, also aspects such as shape, cavity implantation, relationship with other organs and vascularization. The testicles presented cylindrical shape, with a thin, dense and transparent tunica albuginea, and the vascularization was accomplished by the testicular artery that ramifies from the cranial rectal artery. In the samples from December 2006 and May 2007, the media from the macroscopic measures of the right testicles were volume 58.7 and 14.7 ml, length 9.87 and 3.5 cm, width 2.4 and 0.6 cm, thickness 2.4 and 0.5 cm, circumference 8.0 and 2.3 cm, parenchyma weight 27.6 and 6.1 g and tunica albuginea weight 1.0 and 0.3 g, P < 0.05, respectively.

Some measures from the right testicle and epididymis were superior to measures taken from the left ones (P < 0.05), but these were not characterizing asymmetry. The morphometric parameters observed during November 2005 remained on an intermediate situation (P < 0.05); however, they were quantitatively closer to the means of December 2006, which may characterize it as a potential transition period between repose and sexual activity. Morphologically, the testicles and epididymides of greater rhea have common points with other researched birds; however, differences were observed. The testicles and epididymides of the Rhea americana are influenced by the environment, presenting reproductive activity season (November-December) during late spring, early summer and sexual repose season (May) during autumn-winter. The morphometric testicular and epididymal measurements were introduced. The morphometric parameters of testicles and epididymides exhibited differences between winter and spring-summer that could be established like sexual activity season.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2014-08-06", "authors": ["S F MCarvalho", "B NFreneau", "G EFreneau"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12133"}

Twelve canine livers were skeletonized to describe the anatomy of their portal and hepatic veins in details. Our data suggest that the liver can be divided into two sections, three divisions, seven lobes and two to four sub-lobes. This differs from the classic division into four lobes, four sub-lobes and two processes. The right section was perfused by the right portal branch and drained by independent hepatic veins, while most of the left section, perfused by the left portal branch, was drained by the main hepatic vein deriving from the middle and the left hepatic vein confluence. Part of the right medial lobe, and in some cases the papillary process of the caudate lobe, drained directly into the caudal vena cava. A proper right hepatic vein draining blood from more than one lobe was never observed. Portal connections between the quadrate and the left medial lobe were frequently recorded. Two sub-lobes with different portal blood supply and venous drainage could be identified in the right lateral (33.3% of cases) and the left lateral (100% of cases) lobes.

EPCs could have a potential for future therapies with the purpose of enhancing endothelial repair. However, due to the low amount of these cells in circulation they have to be expanded in vitro before administration into recipients. The purpose of this study was to analyse and evaluate possible changes in morphology and functionality as a result of in vitro ageing of a subtype of EPCs called endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs), since such changes might compromise the cells' ability to participate in vasculogenesis. EOCs were isolated and grown from human umbilical cord blood using two methodologies with varying degree of cell purification. The changes between the two culture setups and the changes occurring in EOCs over time were traced by flow cytometry and assays for growth, tube formation, and beta-galactosidase production. The cells showed to be indistinguishable from each other during the first weeks of culture. The cells showed a changed morphology with bigger and more granular cells and the growth rate decreased with time. The cells also showed an increased Beta-galactosidase expression and decreased tube formation ability in late passage EOCs. Our data indicates that EOCs undergo senescence during long-term expansion and therefore time for cell harvest has to be validated in order to achieve functional cells still maintaining a therapeutic potential.

Moreover, EC-seeded constructs incubated with ASC-conditioned medium were used in addition to constructs with ASC seeded on top. Vascular network formation was visualized by green fluorescent protein expressing cells or immunostaining for CD31 and quantified. RT-qPCR of cells derived from co-cultures in fibrin was performed to evaluate changes in the expression of EC marker genes during the first week of culture. Moreover, angiogenesis-related protein levels were measured by performing angiogenesis proteome profiler arrays. The results demonstrate that proximity of endothelial cells and ASC is required for network formation and ASC stabilize EC networks by developing pericyte characteristics.

We retrospectively analysed the results following fixation with two cannulated compression screws and a vascularised iliac bone graft. We treated 18 women and 16 men with a mean age of 38.5 years (20 to 50) whose treatment included the use of an iliac bone graft based on the ascending branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery. There were 20 Garden grade III and 14 grade IV fractures. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated. The mean follow-up was 5.4 years (2 to 10). In 30 hips (88%) union was achieved at a mean of 4.4 months (4 to 6). Nonunion occurred in four hips (12%) and these patients had a mean age of 46.5 years (42 to 50) and underwent revision to a hip replacement six months after operation. The time to union was dependent on age with younger patients achieving earlier union (p < 0.001). According to the Harris hip score which was available for 27 of the 30 hips with satisfactory union, excellent results were obtained in 15 (score \u2265 90 points), fair in ten (score 80 to 90 points), and poor in two hips (\u2264 80 points). One patient aged 48 years developed avascular necrosis of femoral head six years after operation and underwent total hip replacement.

{"title": "Canonical WNT signaling components in vascular development and barrier formation.", "abstract": "Canonical WNT signaling is required for proper vascularization of the CNS during embryonic development. Here, we used mice with targeted mutations in genes encoding canonical WNT pathway members to evaluate the exact contribution of these components in CNS vascular development and in specification of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB). We determined that vasculature in various CNS regions is differentially sensitive to perturbations in canonical WNT signaling. The closely related WNT signaling coreceptors LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 had redundant functions in brain vascular development and barrier maintenance; however, loss of LRP5 alone dramatically altered development of the retinal vasculature. The BBB in the cerebellum and pons/interpeduncular nuclei was highly sensitive to decrements in canonical WNT signaling, and WNT signaling was required to maintain plasticity of barrier properties in mature CNS vasculature. Brain and retinal vascular defects resulting from ablation of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling were ameliorated by stabilizing \u03b2-catenin, while inhibition of \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription recapitulated the vascular development and barrier defects associated with loss of receptor, coreceptor, or ligand, indicating that Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling acts predominantly through \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcriptional regulation.

One response to this observation is to identify single pharmacologic agents that, due to a unique mechanism of action, simultaneously target multiple key pathways involved in melanoma development. Leelamine has been identified as functioning in this manner but has poor bioavailability in animals and causes lethality when administered intravenously. Therefore, a nanoliposomal-based delivery system has been developed, called Nanolipolee-007, which stably loads 60% of the compound. The nanoparticle was as effective at killing melanoma cells as leelamine dissolved in DMSO and was more effective at killing cultured melanoma compared with normal cells. Mechanistically, Nanolipolee-007 inhibited PI3K/Akt, STAT3, and MAPK signaling mediated through inhibition of cholesterol transport. Nanolipolee-007 inhibited the growth of preexisting xenografted melanoma tumors by an average of 64% by decreasing cellular proliferation, reducing tumor vascularization, and increasing cellular apoptosis, with negligible toxicity.

The relative hypervascularity of synovial sarcoma has been well established and is reflected in its enhancement on MR imaging studies. Contrast enhancement on MR imaging has been long used as a marker for tissue vascularization and perfusion, with malignant lesions generally being more vascular and enhancing more rapidly. We recently encountered a patient with a high-grade synovial sarcoma with no discernable necrosis and no vascularity on contrast-enhanced MR images with the subtraction technique, despite enhancement in adjacent regional metastatic lymph nodes.

Here, we uncover two independent and partially redundant protease signaling pathways that include the membrane-anchored serine proteases, matriptase and prostasin, and the G protein-coupled receptor PAR-2 that mediate the establishment of a functional feto-maternal barrier. Mice with a combined matriptase and PAR-2 deficiency do not survive to term and the survival of matriptase-deficient mice heterozygous for PAR-2 is severely diminished. Embryos with the combined loss of PAR-2 and matriptase or PAR-2 and the matriptase partner protease, prostasin, uniformly die on or before embryonic day 14.5. Despite the extensive co-localization of matriptase, prostasin, and PAR-2 in embryonic epithelia, the overall macroscopic and histological analysis of the double-deficient embryos did not reveal any obvious developmental abnormalities. In agreement with this, the conditional deletion of matriptase from the embryo proper did not affect the prenatal development or survival of PAR-2-deficient mice, indicating that the critical redundant functions of matriptase/prostasin and PAR-2 are limited to extraembryonic tissues. Indeed, placentas of the double-deficient animals showed decreased vascularization, and the ability of placental epithelium to establish a functional feto-maternal barrier was severely diminished. Interestingly, molecular analysis suggested that the barrier defect was associated with a selective deficiency in the expression of the tight junction protein, claudin-1.

A detailed description of the procedure is provided to allow safe and consistent performance. Insights into anatomical landmarks, technical nuances, and alternative approaches for facial variations are presented. The following points will be further elucidated in the article. The platysma muscle/submuscular aponeurotic system/galea are the continuous superficial cervical fascia encompassing the majority of facial fat, and this superficial soft tissue envelope is poorly anchored to the face. The deep cervical fascia binds the structural aspects of the face and covers the facial nerve and buccal fat pad. Facial aging is mainly due to gravity's long-term effects on the superficial soft tissue envelope, with more subtle effects on the deeper structural compartments. The deep plane is the embryologic cleavage plane between these fascial layers, and is the logical place for facial dissection. The deep plane allows access to the buccal fat pad for treatment of jowling. Soft tissue mobilization is maximized in deep plane dissections and requires careful hairline planning. Flap advancement creates tension only at the fascia level allowing natural, tension-free skin closure, and long-lasting outcomes.

Fabricating primary vascular networks in a scaffold-free system requires endothelial cells (ECs) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing cells that act together to elaborate a permissive matrix. We report findings on the effects to vascular patterning induced by altering the ratio of human endothelial to human fibroblast cells. Analysis revealed that a 1:4 ratio of ECs to fibroblasts resulted in the synthesis of an ECM permissive for organization of primary vascular networks that recapitulated the pattern of primary vascular networks observed in vivo. Importantly this work highlighted the significance of tension in the organization of vascular networks in prevascularized tissues. To our knowledge our in vitro studies are the first to demonstrate the formation of two distinct vascular patterns in an initially homogenous culture system. Specifically, we demonstrate that within our constructs, vascular networks formed with distinct directional orientations that reflect self-assembly-mediated tension. Further, our studies demonstrate that treatment of prevascularized tissues with matrix-promoting factors such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) increases tissue strength without altering vascular network patterning. Together, the ability to generate prevascularized tissues from human cells in scaffold-free systems and the ability to enhance the strength of the constructs with matrix-promoting factors represent advances to the potential translational utility of prevascularized tissues both as subcutaneous implants and in surgical scenarios requiring the application of tension to the tissue construct.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Inadequate placental volume or vascularity might indicate poor fetal growth or gestational complications. This study aimed to evaluate the placental volume and vascular indices during the period of 11-14 weeks of gestation in a Taiwanese population.\nFrom June 2006 to September 2009, three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound was performed in 222 normal pregnancies from 11-14 weeks of gestation. Power Doppler ultrasound was applied to the placenta and the placental volume was obtained by a rotational technique (VOCAL). The three-dimensional power histogram was used to assess the placental vascular indices, including the mean gray value, the vascularization index, the flow index, and the vascularization flow index. The placental vascular indices were then plotted against gestational age (GA) and placental volume.\nOur results showed that the linear regression equation for placental volume using gestational week as the independent variable was placental volume = 18.852 \u00d7 GA - 180.89 (r = 0.481, p < 0.05).

Common processes of heart regeneration are cardiomyocyte proliferation, activation of epicardial tissue, and neovascularization. In order to further characterize heart regeneration processes, we introduced milder injuries and compared responses to those induced by ventricular apex resection, a widely used injury method. We used scratching of the ventricular surface and puncturing of the ventricle with a fine tungsten needle as injury-inducing techniques.\nScratching the ventricular surface induced subtle cardiomyocyte proliferation and responses of the epicardium. Endothelial cell accumulation was limited to the surface of the heart. Ventricular puncture induced cardiomyocyte proliferation, endocardial and epicardial activation, and neo-vascularization, similar to the resection method. However, the degree of the responses was milder, correlating with milder injury. Sham operation induced epicardial aldh1a2 expression but not tbx18 and WT1.\nPuncturing the ventricle induces responses equivalent to resection at milder degrees in a shorter time frame and can be used as a simple injury model.

Two queries were performed using \"vascular delay,\" a search expected to yield perspectives from the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, and \"ischemic preconditioning,\" (IPC) which was expected to yield research on the same topic in other fields. Results\u2003The combined searches yielded a total of 1824 abstracts. The \"vascular delay\" query yielded 76 articles from 1984 to 2011.

Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that ablation of endogenous EIF5A2 inhibited tumor angiogenesis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression. Given that MMP-2 degrades collagen IV, a main component of the vascular basement membrane (BM), we subsequently investigated the effect of EIF5A2 on tumor vasculature remodeling using complementary approaches, including fluorescent immunostaining, transmission electron microscopy, tumor perfusion assays and tumor hypoxia assays. Taken together, our results indicate that EIF5A2 silencing increases tumor vessel wall continuity, increases blood perfusion and improves tumor oxygenation. Additionally, we found that ablation of EIF5A2 enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Finally, we demonstrated that EIF5A2 might exert these functions by enhancing MMP-2 activity via activation of p38 MAPK and JNK/c-Jun pathways.\nThis study highlights an important role of EIF5A2 in HCC tumor vessel remodeling and indicates that EIF5A2 represents a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of HCC.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["Feng-WeiWang", "Mu-YanCai", "Shi-JuanMai", "Jie-WeiChen", "Hai-YanBai", "YanLi", "Yi-JiLiao", "Chang-PengLi", "Xiao-PengTian", "Hsiang-FuKung", "Xin-YuanGuan", "DanXie"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.2236"}

Despite its established role in physiology and disease, the mechanism of endoglin down-regulation remains unknown. Here we report that the conserved juxtamembrane cytoplasmic tyrosine motif ((612)YIY(614)) is a critical determinant of angiogenesis. Src directly phosphorylates this motif to induce endoglin internalization and degradation via the lysosome. We identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as Src-activators that induce endoglin turnover following (612)YIY(614) phosphorylation. Interestingly, Src phosphorylation of endoglin-(612)YIY(614) was also an important process for receptor down-regulation by TRACON105 (TRC105), an endoglin-targeting antibody currently in clinical trials. The regulation of (612)YIY(614) phosphorylation was critical for angiogenesis, as both the phosphomimetic and unphosphorylatable mutants impaired endothelial functions including proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation.

The patient came to the OR for surgical debridement and had massive bone resection of the left calcaneus. The right leg showed limited skin defect at the lower part, exposing the medial side of the ankle and a tibial bone defect, measuring 10 cm. Salvage the left leg was impossible due to complex nerve, bones and skin associated injuries, so this leg was sacrificed and used as a donor limb, to harvest a free fibula flap for contralateral tibial reconstruction. At 18 months of follow-up, the patient was very satisfied, the clinical result was very good on both lower limbs and X-rays showed excellent integration of the free fibula flap. The patient had normal dailies occupations, can run and have bicycle sport practice with a functional left leg fit prosthesis. This case showed an original application of the \"fillet flap concept\" to resolve complex and rare traumatic situations interesting the both lower limbs. In our opinion, this strategy must be a part of the plastic surgeon skills in uncommon situations.", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["MBouyer", "DCorcella", "AForli", "VMesquida", "ASemere", "FMoutet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anplas.2014.06.009"}

Vertical and, increasingly, oblique rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps have been used to fill potential dead space and bring healthy, vascularized tissue into the defect. The authors compared the complications and outcomes of patients undergoing perineal or groin reconstruction with vertical or oblique rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps. They hypothesized that the oblique flap offers outcomes similar to those of the vertical flap, without an increased risk of complications.\nAll patients who underwent immediate reconstruction of perineal, pelvic, or groin defects using vertical (n=49) or oblique rectus abdominis myocutaneous (n=22) flaps over the past 10 years at the University of Washington Medical Center were reviewed retrospectively. Patient, disease, and obliterative procedure characteristics and donor- and recipient-site complications were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in major or minor donor- or recipient-site complication rates, need for augmented fascial closure, need for additional flaps, flap loss, readmission, or reoperation rate between the two groups.\nImmediate reconstruction of perineal or groin defects with oblique rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps results in complication rates similar to those with reconstruction using with vertical flaps. Oblique flap reconstruction is a reasonable and safe alternative, providing several distinct advantages over the vertical flap, including greater arc of rotation, thinner skin paddle, less bulk, and limited fascial harvest.\nTherapeutic, III.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["Patrick DCombs", "Janelle DSousa", "OtwayLouie", "Hakim KSaid", "Peter CNeligan", "David WMathes"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000000324"}

{"title": "Cyr61 silencing reduces vascularization and dissemination of osteosarcoma tumors.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent primary pediatric cancer-related bone disease. These tumors frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy and are highly metastatic, leading to poor outcome. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies that can prevent cell dissemination. We previously showed that CYR61/CCN1 expression in osteosarcoma cells is correlated to aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo in mouse models, as well as in patients. In this study, we found that CYR61 is a critical contributor to the vascularization of primary tumor. We demonstrate that silencing CYR61, using lentiviral transduction, leads to a significant reduction in expression level of pro-angiogenic markers such as VEGF, FGF2, PECAM and angiopoietins concomitantly to an increased expression of major anti-angiogenic markers such as thrombospondin-1 and SPARC. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 family member expression, a key pathway in osteosarcoma metastatic capacity was also downregulated when CYR61 was downregulated in osteosarcoma cells. Using a metastatic murine model, we show that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells results in reduced tumor vasculature and slows tumor growth compared with control. We also find that microvessel density correlates with lung metastasis occurrence and that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells limits the number of metastases. Taken together, our data indicate that CYR61 silencing can blunt the malignant behavior of osteosarcoma tumor cells by limiting primary tumor growth and dissemination process.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["NHabel", "MVilalta", "OBawa", "POpolon", "JBlanco", "OFromigu\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2014.232"}

Pancreatic cancer cells express high levels of PAR-2 and activation of PAR-2 may induce their proliferation and migration. Interestingly, however, PAR-2 expression is increased in stroma-rich pancreatic cancer regions, suggesting a potential role of PAR-2 in the tumour microenvironment. Here, we assessed the importance of PAR-2 in the stromal compartment by utilizing an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, in which tumour cells are PAR-2-positive, whereas stromal cells are PAR-2-negative. We assessed tumour weight and volume and analysed proliferation and (lymph)angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. We show that genetic ablation of PAR-2 from the stromal compartment inhibits primary tumour growth, which is accompanied by reduced vascularization in primary tumours and reduced in tube formation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. In contrast to smaller primary tumours, the number of lymph node metastases was increased in PAR-2-deficient animals, which was accompanied by an increased number of lymphatic vessels. In vitro tube-formation assays show that PAR-2 does not inhibit the intrinsic tube-forming capacity of lymphatic endothelial cells, but that PAR-2 actually inhibits cancer cell-induced tube formation. Overall, stromal PAR-2 thus plays a dual role in pancreatic cancer development by potentiating primary tumour growth but limiting lymphangiogenesis and subsequent lymph node metastasis. Our data identify a novel role of PAR-2 in the tumour microenvironment and pinpoint PAR-2 as a negative regulator of lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["KunShi", "Karla C SQueiroz", "Joris J T HRoelofs", "Carel J Mvan Noesel", "Dirk JRichel", "C ArnoldSpek"], "doi": "10.1002/path.4411"}

Differences in the NIR signals can reflect many physiological changes, which are in turn associated with such factors as vascularization, cellularity, oxygen consumption, or remodeling. NIR spectral differences between colorectal cancer and healthy tissues were investigated. A Fourier transform NIR spectroscopy instrument equipped with a fiber-optic probe was used to mimic in situ clinical measurements. A total of 186 spectra were collected and then underwent the preprocessing of standard normalize variate (SNV) for removing unwanted background variances. All the specimen and spots used for spectral collection were confirmed staining and examination by an experienced pathologist so as to ensure the representative of the pathology. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to uncover the possible clustering. Several methods including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA), K-nearest neighbor and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to extract spectral features and to construct the diagnostic models. By comparison, it reveals that, even if no obvious difference of misclassified ratio (MCR) was observed between these models, RF is preferable since it is quicker, more convenient and insensitive to over-fitting.

Rapid vascularization of the biomaterial crucially contributes to its adequate incorporation without complications. Macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) is a toll-like receptor (TLR)-2/6 agonist with pro-angiogenic properties. Herein we analyzed whether local single-shot application of MALP-2 improves the angiogenic host tissue response to Medpor\u00ae. Medpor\u00ae (3 mm\u00d73 mm\u00d70.25 mm) was implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of BALB/c mice topically exposed to different MALP-2 doses (0.1 and 0.5 \u03bcg) or vehicle (control). The vascularization of the implants and the inflammatory foreign body reaction was analyzed using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry over 14 days. MALP-2 treatment dose-dependently improved the vascularization of Medpor\u00ae, as indicated by a significantly higher functional microvessel density at the border and center of the implants when compared to controls. This was associated with a temporary increase of adherent leukocytes in host tissue venules during the first 3 days after implantation. At day 14, implants in MALP-2-treated chambers were surrounded by granulation tissue, which exhibited a significantly higher density of CD31-positive microvessels and number of F4/80-positive macrophages when compared to controls. Additional biomaterial-free chambers did not show any signs of angiogenesis when treated with MALP-2. This indicates that locally applied MALP-2 effectively stimulates the early vascularization of Medpor\u00ae without inducing any local or systemic side effects.

The anatomy corroborates the separation of the series Americanae, Fluminenses, Indicae and Sensitivae, with the shape of the petiole, types of trichomes and quantity of vascular units in the petiole as main characteristics to delimit the species. The petiole shape varies from cylindric in A. americana, A. sensitiva and A. fluminensis, to triangular in A. evenia and quadrangular in A. rudis, A. denticulata and A. ciliata. We observed four types of trichomes: hydathode trichome, long conic trichome, short conic trichome and bulb-based trichome. The hydathode trichome was the most common, except for A. americana and A. fluminensis. Species with higher affinity with water share similar adaptive characteristics, including hydathode trichomes described for the first time for the genus.

Mostly the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) or first or second perforating branch of the profound femoral artery is used for the customary recipient vessel. In this report, an alternative technique of using descending branch of LCFA in VFG surgery and its clinical results are reported. Sixteen patients (13 men and 3 women) underwent VFG surgery between the years 2005 and 2012. Predicted etiologies were: ANFH in 10 hips, traumatic femur neck pseudoarthrosis in 4 hips, tumor in 1 hip, and 1 femur shaft defect due to osteomyelitis. Patients' average age at the time of surgery was 29 years (range, 14-43 years). All patients were treated with VFG. All of the grafts survived and none of the patients needed any revision surgery. One had superficial wound infection, one developed peroneal nerve palsy, and one had trochanteric bursitis. The follow-up time was 36 months (range 20-72).

{"title": "The phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor cilostazol does not stimulate growth of colorectal liver metastases after major hepatectomy.", "abstract": "Liver failure after extended hepatectomy represents a major challenge in the surgery of hepatic colorectal metastasis. A previous study has indicated that inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE 3) stimulates liver regeneration. However, little is known whether PDE 3 inhibitors, such as cilostazol, also stimulate the growth of remnant metastases. Therefore, we herein studied the effect of cilostazol on engraftment, vascularization and growth of colorectal liver metastasis after major hepatectomy. WAG-rats underwent either major hepatectomy or sham operation. Metastases were induced by subcapsular implantation of 5 \u00d7 10(5) CC531-colorectal cancer cells. Animals were daily treated with cilostazol (5 mg/kg body weight) or glucose solution. Tumor growth was measured by high-resolution ultrasound at days 7 and 14. Tumor vascularization and tumor cell proliferation were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. High-resolution ultrasound analysis in hepatectomized and non-hepatectomized animals showed that cilostazol does not stimulate tumor growth. Accordingly, the number of PCNA-positive tumor cells did not differ between cilostazol-treated animals and sham-treated controls. Interestingly, cilostazol reduced tumor vascularization in both hepatectomized and non-hepatectomized animals. This was indicated by a significantly lower number of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1)-positive cells in tumors of cilostazol-treated animals compared to sham-treated controls.

The treatment of burn injuries is influenced by severity, location, and the percentage of total body surface area. There have been a number of different techniques developed to temporize and repair the destroyed tissue. However, in patients with large wound burden, sufficient donor site tissue may not be available for autograft harvesting. Such extensive burns necessitate other temporary and permanent options for wound coverage such as skin or vascularized composite allografts (VCA). Rejection of these tissues presents an ongoing problem which is currently managed using a host of systemic immunosuppressive medications. This article discusses the mechanism behind the innate and adaptive immune systems rejection of the allografts. By understanding these pathways, various techniques using immunomodulatory protocols have led to increased allograft survival. However, our primary interest lies in the initial recognition of the graft. We tailor this article to have a specific emphasis on lymphatic modulation as a potential adjunctive therapy.

This phenomenon could be explained by the regulatory function of neuropeptides. Neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been demonstrated to contribute to bone growth by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). However, there have been no prior studies on the association between Wnt signaling and the mechanism of SP in the context of BMSC differentiation. Our results have shown that SP could enhance the differentiation of BMSCs by activating gene and protein expression via the Wnt pathway and by translocating \u03b2-catenin, which can be inhibited by Wnt signaling blocker treatment or by the NK-1 antagonist. SP could also increase the growth factor level of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Additionally, SP could enhance the migration ability of BMSCs, and the promotion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by SP has been studied. In conclusion, SP could induce osteoblastic differentiation via the Wnt pathway and promote the angiogenic ability of BMSCs.

{"title": "Lipopolysaccharide preconditioning facilitates M2 activation of resident microglia after spinal cord injury.", "abstract": "The inflammatory response following spinal cord injury (SCI) has both harmful and beneficial effects; however, it can be modulated for therapeutic benefit. Endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning, a well-established method for modifying the immune reaction, has been shown to attenuate damage induced by stroke and brain trauma in rodent models. Although such effects likely are conveyed by tissue-repairing functions of the inflammatory response, the mechanisms that control the effects have not yet been elucidated. The present study preconditioned C57BL6/J mice with 0.05 mg/kg of LPS 48 hr before inducing contusion SCI to investigate the effect of LPS preconditioning on the activation of macrophages/microglia. We found that LPS preconditioning promotes the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages/microglia toward an M2 phenotype in the injured spinal cord on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemical analyses. Flow cytometric analyses reveal that LPS preconditioning facilitates M2 activation in resident microglia but not in infiltrating macrophages. Augmented M2 activation was accompanied by vascularization around the injured lesion, resulting in improvement in both tissue reorganization and functional recovery. Furthermore, we found that M2 activation induced by LPS preconditioning is regulated by interleukin-10 gene expression, which was preceded by the transcriptional activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, as demonstrated by Western blotting and an IRF-3 binding assay. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that LPS preconditioning has a therapeutic effect on SCI through the modulation of M1/M2 polarization of resident microglia. The present study suggests that controlling M1/M2 polarization through endotoxin signal transduction could become a promising therapeutic strategy for various central nervous system diseases. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience research", "date": "2014-07-22", "authors": ["KentaroHayakawa", "RentaroOkazaki", "KazuhitoMorioka", "KozoNakamura", "SakaeTanaka", "ToruOgata"], "doi": "10.1002/jnr.23448"}

Active angiogenesis and metastasis are responsible for rapid recurrence and poor survival of HCC. However, the mechanisms that contribute to tumor metastasis remain unclear. Here we evaluate the effects of ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial H(+)-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, on HCC angiogenesis and metastasis. We found that increased expression of IF1 in human HCC predicts poor survival and disease recurrence after surgery. Patients with HCC who have large tumors, with vascular invasion and metastasis, expressed high levels of IF1. Invasive tumors overexpressing IF1 were featured by active epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased angiogenesis, whereas silencing IF1 expression attenuated EMT and invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, IF1 promoted Snai1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by way of activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling, which depended on the binding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) to NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the disruption of NIK association with the TRAF2-cIAP2 complex. Suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway interfered with IF1-mediated EMT and invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that NF-\u03baB can bind to the Snai1 promoter and trigger its transcription. IF1 was directly transcribed by NF-\u03baB, thus forming a positive feedback signaling loop.

The acid glycosphingolipid fractions had both sulfatide and gangliosides (GM3, GM2, GM1, fucosyl-GM1, GD3 and GD1a), and all gangliosides contained N-acetyl-neuraminic acid. Significantly, the N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (NeuGc) variant, a major component in many pig organs and to which humans can develop antibodies, was not detected among the gangliosides.\nPig valve cusps contain several complex lipid-bound carbohydrate structures that may be targets for the human immune system. Notable, the NeuGc determinant was absent in the cusp gangliosides.

We report a hand-allografted patient who developed severe rejection following discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment. It manifested clinically with erythematous maculopapules on the skin and pathologically with graft vasculopathy that affected both large vessels and smaller cutaneous ones. The observation that graft vasculopathy can affect skin vessels shows that it is amenable to diagnosis with usual skin biopsy as recommended for the follow-up of these allografts. Graft vasculopathy developing in the setting of vascularized composite allografts likely represents chronic rejection due to under-immunosuppression and, if confirmed, should be included in a future update of the Banff classification of vascularized composite allograft rejection.", "journal": "Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation", "date": "2014-07-22", "authors": ["JeanKanitakis", "GeorgiaKarayannopoulou", "MarcoLanzetta", "PalminaPetruzzo"], "doi": "10.1111/tri.12399"}
{"title": "Ultrasound of the male genital tract in relation to male reproductive health.", "abstract": "Infertility affects \u223c7% of all men. Despite much progress, mainly in genetics, its etiology remains obscure in \u223c50% of cases. To fill this gap, imaging of the male genital tract (MGT) has progressively expanded, providing useful information in the assessment of MGT abnormalities.\nA critical, systematic review of the available literature was performed using Medline, with no restrictions regarding date of publication (i.e. from inception date until March 2014), along with analysis of previous reports in color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) atlas textbooks. Normal anatomy and sonographic characteristics of the MGT have also been summarized.\nTesticular volume (TV) is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. Ultrasound (US) offers a greater accuracy in TV measurement than Prader orchidometer (PO). However US- and PO-derived TV are closely related, making PO-derived TV informative enough in the work-up of the infertile man in everyday clinical practice. US-derived TV might play an independent role in specific clinical conditions (i.e. large hydrocele, inguinal testis, enlarged epididymis). Scrotal US may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of malignancy, or testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testis vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions (i.e. lymphoma, leukemia). The impact of varicocele detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters/fatherhood is debated. At present, the clinical management of varicocele is mainly based on physical examination. However, CDUS is useful in assessing venous reflux, when palpation is unreliable and/or in detecting recurrence/persistence after surgery. Epididymis head and/or tail dilation is suggestive of MGT obstruction or inflammation and both are related, along with echo-texture abnormalities, to impaired sperm parameters. Scrotal and transrectal US (TRUS) are useful in detecting congenital uni- or bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with epididymis, seminal vesicles (SV) or kidney abnormalities/agenesis. TRUS plays a key role in assessing obstructive azoospermia and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to ejaculatory ducts obstruction, such as ejaculatory duct abnormalities, prostate median cysts or SV enlargement/emptying impairment. TRUS findings lead to operational decision-making, such as testicular sperm extraction in the case of CBAVD, cyst aspiration in the case of a large prostatic median cyst, and surgical treatment if ejaculatory duct abnormalities are observed. TRUS may reveal prostate volume reduction (suggestive of hypogonadism) or enlargement, which can be related to aging or even metabolic abnormalities. Finally, TRUS may reveal prostate and SV echo-texture abnormalities suggestive of inflammation or SV stasis.\nMGT-CDUS is a useful tool in detecting abnormalities related to impaired male reproductive health. However, it suffers from a lack of standardization and often produces subjective/vague diagnoses. To fill this gap, the European Academy of Andrology has promoted an ongoing multicenter study aimed at defining the MGT-CDUS characteristics of healthy, fertile men.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2014-07-21", "authors": ["FrancescoLotti", "MarioMaggi"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/dmu042"}

In bone regenerative strategies, combined seeding of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) proves their mutual stimulatory effects. Here, we investigated whether stromal-cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) stimulates vascularization by EPCs and whether SDF-1\u03b1 could replace seeded cells in ectopic bone formation. Late EPCs of goat origin were characterized for their endothelial phenotype and showed to be responsive to SDF-1\u03b1 in in vitro migration assays. Subsequently, subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel plugs that contained both EPCs and SDF-1\u03b1 showed more tubule formation than constructs containing either EPCs or SDF-1\u03b1. Addition of either EPCs or SDF-1\u03b1 to MSC-based constructs showed even more elaborate vascular networks after 1 week in vivo, with SDF-1\u03b1/MSC-laden groups showing more prominent interconnected networks than EPC/MSC-laden groups. The presence of abundant mouse-specific CD31/PECAM expression in these constructs confirmed ingrowth of murine vessels and discriminated between angiogenesis and vessel networks formed by seeded goat cells. Importantly, implantation of EPC/MSC or SDF-1\u03b1/MSC constructs resulted in indistinguishable ectopic bone formation. In both groups, bone onset was apparent at week 3 of implantation. Taken together, we demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 stimulated the migration of EPCs in vitro and vascularization in vivo. Further, SDF-1\u03b1 addition was as effective as EPCs in inducing the formation of vascularized ectopic bone based on MSC-seeded constructs, suggesting a cell-replacement role for SDF-1\u03b1.

{"title": "Activated Notch1 expression is associated with angiogenesis in cutaneous melanoma.", "abstract": "An early event in melanocytic tumor growth is the upregulation of Notch signaling. When an active form of Notch1 is overexpressed in primary human melanocytes, it increases cell growth, survival and invasive properties, promoting melanoma progression. Recent evidence suggested that tumor initiation and growth are driven by a subset of tumor-initiating cells termed cancer stem cells. Notch1 plays a predominant role in the maintenance of melanoblasts, including melanocyte stem cells, by preventing initiation of apoptosis. Moreover, the importance of Notch1 in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis is supported by growing evidence in various cancers. Nestin has been widely used as a marker for melanocyte stem cells as well as an angiogenic marker to evaluate neovascularity of endothelial cells in tumors. To gain an insight into the impact of Notch1 activation on the maintenance of melanocyte stem cells and angiogenesis in melanoma, the expression levels of activated Notch1 and nestin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 114 primary cutaneous melanomas and 35 lymph node metastases. Activated Notch1 and nestin expression was also evaluated in four dysplastic melanocytic nevi. This study provides evidence that activated Notch1 is overexpressed in cutaneous melanoma, in tumor cells as well as in microvessel endothelium, and that it can promote tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, the overexpression of activated Notch1 in both tumor and vascular endothelial cells was significantly associated with microvascular density in melanoma samples. Thus, activated Notch1 inhibitors may provide a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of melanoma by blocking tumor-associated vascularization.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2014-07-19", "authors": ["DanielaMurtas", "FrancaPiras", "LuigiMinerba", "CristinaMaxia", "CaterinaFerreli", "PaoloDemurtas", "SimoneLai", "EsterMura", "MichelaCorrias", "PaolaSirigu", "Maria TeresaPerra"], "doi": "10.1007/s10238-014-0300-y"}

{"title": "The development of a malignant tumor is due to a desperate asexual self-cloning process in which cancer stem cells develop the ability to mimic the genetic program of germline cells.", "abstract": "To date there is no explanation why the development of almost all types of solid tumors occurs sharing a similar scenario: (1) creation of a cancer stem cell (CSC), (2) CSC multiplication and formation of a multicellular tumor spheroid (TS), (3) vascularization of the TS and its transformation into a vascularized primary tumor, (4) metastatic spreading of CSCs, (5) formation of a metastatic TSs and its transformation into metastatic tumors, and (6) potentially endless repetition of this cycle of events. The above gaps in our knowledge are related to the biology of cancer and specifically to tumorigenesis, which covers the process from the creation of a CSC to the formation of a malignant tumor and the development of metastases. My Oncogerminative Theory of Tumorigenesis considers tumor formation as a dynamic self-organizing process that mimics a self-organizing process of early embryo development. In the initial step in that process, gene mutations combined with epigenetic dysregulation cause somatic cells to be reprogrammed into CSCs, which are immortal pseudo-germline cells. Mimicking the behavior of fertilized germline cells, the CSC achieves immortality by passing through the stages of its life-cycle and developing into a pseudo-blastula-stage embryo, which manifests in the body as a malignant tumor. In this view, the development of a malignant tumor from a CSC is a phenomenon of developmental biology, which we named a desperate asexual self-cloning event. The theory explains seven core characteristics of malignant tumors: (1) CSC immortality, (2) multistep development of a malignant tumor from a single CSC, (3) heterogeneity of malignant tumor cell populations, (4) metastatic spread of CSCs, (5) invasive growth, (6) malignant progression, and (7) selective immune tolerance toward cancer cells.

We provide the first description of the long bone histology of the dyrosaurids. Specimens were collected from the Maria Farinha Formation, in the Para\u00edba Basin of northeast Brazil. Thin sections of a right femur and left tibia were made. In the left tibia, the cortex consists of lamellar-zonal bone with five lines of arrested growth (LAGs), spaced \u223c300 \u00b5m apart. The tibia contains a small to medium-sized organized vascular network of both simple vascular canals and primary osteons that decrease in density periostially. The femur exhibits a similar histological pattern overall but has double-LAGs, and an EFS layer (the latter is rare in living crocodylians). Secondary osteons occur in the deep cortex near and inside the spongiosa as a result of remodeling in both bones. This tissue pattern is fairly common among slow-growing animals. These specimens were a sub-adult and a senescent. Patterns in the distribution of bone consistent with osteosclerosis suggest that these animals probably hada fast-swimming ecology.

To provide a tool for modeling this important feature of human tissue microenvironments, we developed a microfluidic chip for creating tissue-engineered microenvironment systems (TEMS) composed of tubular cell structures. Our chip design encompasses a small chamber that is filled with an extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding one or more tubular channels. Endothelial cells (ECs) seeded into the channels adhere to the ECM walls and grow into perfusable tubular tissue structures that are fluidically connected to upstream and downstream fluid channels in the chip. Using these chips we created models of angiogenesis, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and tumor-cell extravasation. Our angiogenesis model recapitulates true angiogenesis, in which sprouting occurs from a \"parent\" vessel in response to a gradient of growth factors. Our BBB model is composed of a microvessel generated from brain-specific ECs within an ECM populated with astrocytes and pericytes. Our tumor-cell extravasation model can be utilized to visualize and measure tumor-cell migration through vessel walls into the surrounding matrix. The described technology can be used to create TEMS that recapitulate structural, functional, and physico-chemical elements of vascularized human tissue microenvironments in vitro.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2014-07-18", "authors": ["AnnaTourovskaia", "MarkFauver", "GregoryKramer", "SaraSimonson", "ThomasNeumann"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370214539228"}
{"title": "Repopulation of decellularized whole organ scaffold using stem cells: an emerging technology for the development of neo-organ.", "abstract": "Demand of donor organs for transplantation in treatment of organ failure is increasing. Hence there is a need to develop new strategies for the alternative sources of organ development. Attempts are being made to use xenogenic organs by genetic manipulation but the organ rejection against human always has been a major challenge for the survival of the graft. Advancement in the genetic bioengineering and combination of different allied sciences for the development of humanized organ system, the therapeutic influence of stem cell fraction on the reconstitution of organ architecture and their regenerative abilities in different tissues and organs provides a better approach to solve the problem of organ shortage. However, the available strategies for generating the organ/tissue scaffolds limit its application due to the absence of complete three-dimensional (3D) organ architecture, mechanical strength, long-term cell survival, and vascularization. Repopulation of whole decellularized organ scaffolds using stem cells has added a new dimension for creating new bioengineered organs. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the potential application of decellularization and recellularization approach for the development of functional bio-artificial organs. With the help of established procedures for conditioning, extensive stem cells and organ engineering experiments/transplants for the development of humanized organs will allow its preclinical evaluation for organ regeneration before translation to the clinic.

Despite its increasing importance in everyday clinical routine, endoscopic ultrasound outcomes are still highly operator-dependent and tissue confirmation with fine needle aspiration is very often required for definitive differential diagnosis of tumors. Several techniques of image enhancement have been developed in recent years in the attempt to make the technique less operator-dependent. Among them the most important appear to be contrast harmonic-endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound-elastography. Contrast harmonic-endoscopic ultrasound is performed with a dedicated harmonic which displays the fine vascular network of both normal and pathological tissues after injection of an ultrasound contrast agent. Endoscopic ultrasound-elastography displays with different colors the differences in hardness between tissues, thus estimating elasticity in soft normal tissues which appear red and hard neoplastic tissues which appear blue. While contrast harmonic-endoscopic ultrasound has been introduced into clinical practice, endoscopic ultrasound-elastography mainly represents an investigational tool. The purpose of this paper was to review the mechanism of action and the clinical outcomes of contrast harmonic-endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound-elastography in pancreatic diseases.

Results were compiled by center and compared using two-tailed t tests.\nTwenty of 22 centers (91 percent) responded to the survey. Peripheral blood was the most commonly reported donor sample for vascularized composite tissue allotransplant crossmatching [78 percent of centers (n=14)], with only 22 percent (n=4) using lymph nodes. However, 56 percent of the 18 centers (n=10) that had performed vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation reported that they harvested lymph nodes for crossmatching. Of responding individuals, 62.5 percent (10 of 16 individuals) felt that lymph nodes were the best donor sample for crossmatching.\nA slight majority of vascularized composite tissue allotransplant centers that have performed clinical transplants have used lymph nodes for human leukocyte antigen matching, and centers appear to be divided on the utility of lymph node harvest.

Neovascularization is essential to the developing endometriosis lesion to support its growth. Synuclein-\u03b3 (SNCG), a protein implicated in cellular proliferation, is associated with a broad range of malignancies as well as endometriosis. We hypothesized that SNCG plays an important role in the neovascularization and growth of endometriosis and blocking of SNCG will interfere with survival of endometriotic lesions in a mouse model. We developed SP012, a novel 12 amino acid peptide inhibitor of SNCG. SP012 inhibited three-dimensional endothelial cell tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Using intravital microscopy, SP012 was shown to be successfully delivered to human endometriotic lesions in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Alymphoid (BALB/c-Rag2-/-Il2r\u03b3-/- lacking T, B and NK cells) mice were surgically induced with human endometriotic lesions and treated with SP012 or phosphate-buffered saline control. SP012 treated endometriotic lesions had decreased growth, development and vascularization at the time of necroscopy. Endometriotic lesions treated with SP012 also had fewer isolectin (+) microvessels. These results, using a mouse model, indicate that SNCG plays a role in the neovascularization and subsequent growth of human endometriotic lesions.

Common sites affected include the femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus. Symptomatic femoral head osteonecrosis accounts for 10,000-20,000 new cases annually in the United States. In contradistinction, metadiaphyseal osteonecrosis is often occult and asymptomatic. There are numerous causes of osteonecrosis most commonly related to trauma, corticosteroids, and idiopathic. Imaging of osteonecrosis is frequently diagnostic with a serpentine rim of sclerosis on radiographs, photopenia in early disease at bone scintigraphy, and maintained yellow marrow at MR imaging with a serpentine rim of high signal intensity (double-line sign) on images obtained with long repetition time sequences. These radiologic features correspond to the underlying pathology of osseous response to wall off the osteonecrotic process and attempts at repair with vascularized granulation tissue at the reactive interface. The long-term clinical importance of epiphyseal osteonecrosis is almost exclusively based on the likelihood of overlying articular collapse. MR imaging is generally considered the most sensitive and specific imaging modality both for early diagnosis and identifying features that increase the possibility of this complication. Treatment subsequent to articular collapse and development of secondary osteoarthritis typically requires reconstructive surgery. Malignant transformation of osteonecrosis is rare and almost exclusively associated with metadiaphyseal lesions.

{"title": "A comparative study of oxygen diffusion in tissue engineering scaffolds.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering scaffolds are designed to support tissue self-healing within physiological environments by promoting the attachment, growth and differentiation of relevant cells. Newly formed tissue must be supplied with sufficient levels of oxygen to prevent necrosis. Oxygen diffusion is the major transport mechanism before vascularization is completed and oxygen is predominantly supplied via blood vessels. The present study compares different designs for scaffolds in the context of their oxygen diffusion ability. In all cases, oxygen diffusion is confined to the scaffold pores that are assumed to be completely occupied by newly formed tissue. The solid phase of the scaffolds acts as diffusion barrier that locally inhibits oxygen diffusion, i.e. no oxygen passes through the scaffold material. As a result, the oxygen diffusivity is determined by the scaffold porosity and pore architecture. Lattice Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the normalized oxygen diffusivities in scaffolds obtained by the foam replication (FR) method, robocasting and sol-gel foaming. Scaffolds made by the FR method were found to have the highest oxygen diffusivity due to their high porosity and interconnected pores. These structures enable the best oxygen supply for newly formed tissue among the scaffold types considered according to the present numerical predictions.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

In the design of biomaterials for tissue engineering applications it is increasingly clear that new approaches are required to locally tailor the biomolecular environment surrounding cells within the matrix. One area of particular focus is strategies to improve the speed or quality of vascular ingrowth and remodeling. While the addition of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to improve vascular response, strategies to immobilize such signals within a biomaterial offer the opportunity to optimize efficiency and to explore spatially defined patterning of such signals. Here we describe the use of benzophenone (BP) photolithography to decorate three-dimensional collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds with VEGF in a spatially defined manner. In this effort we demonstrate functional patterning of a known agonist of vascular remodeling and directly observe phenotypic effects induced by this immobilized cue. VEGF was successfully patterned in both stripes and square motifs across the scaffold with high specificity (on:off pattern signal). The depth of patterning was determined to extend up to 500 \u03bcm into the scaffold microstructure. Notably, photopatterned VEGF retained native functionality as it was shown to induce morphological changes in human umbilical vein cells indicative of early vasculogenesis. Immobilized VEGF led to greater cell infiltration into the scaffold and the formation of immature vascular network structures.

Assessment of tumoral neo-angiogenesis, assessed by morphometric analysis of the vascular network after CD31 immunolabeling, showed that both sunitinib and sorafenib reduced the microvessel area (-85% and -80%, respectively) and length (-80% and -78%, respectively) in treated compared to control tumors. In addition, the number of vessel nodes was significantly lower in treated tumors (-95% and -84%, respectively). Furthermore, cleaved caspase 3 immunolabeling revealed a marked increase in the number of apoptotic cells in tumors from treated animals. Sunitinib and sorafenib could exert a direct effect on PC12 cell viability in vitro. While sunitinib induced a rapid (4h) and pronounced (5-fold) increase in caspase-3/7-dependent apoptosis, sorafenib seems to exert its cytotoxic activity through a different mechanism. Altogether, our data demonstrate that sunitinib and sorafenib have the ability to impair pheochromocytoma development by inhibiting angiogenesis and reducing tumor cell viability. These results strongly suggest that both sunitinib and sorafenib could represent valuable therapeutic tools for pheochromocytoma.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2014-07-13", "authors": ["MDenorme", "LYon", "CRoux", "B JGonzalez", "EBaudin", "YAnouar", "CDubessy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2014.07.005"}
{"title": "Placental vascular defects in compromised pregnancies: effects of assisted reproductive technologies and other maternal stressors.", "abstract": "Many factors negatively affect pregnancy establishment and subsequent fetal growth and development, including maternal factors such as nutritional stress, age, body mass index, and genetic background, and external factors including environmental stress, psychosocial stress, multiple fetuses, medical conditions (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome), lifestyle choices (e.g., alcohol consumption, smoking), and assisted reproductive technologies. These same factors have similar consequences for placental growth and development, including vascular development. We and others have shown that placental vascular development begins very early in pregnancy and determines, to a large extent, placental function-that is, the magnitude of the increase in placental blood flow and thus nutrient transport to the fetus. During the peri-implantation period and also later in pregnancy, cloned (somatic cell nuclear transfer) embryos exhibit a variety of placental defects including reduced vascularization and altered expression of angiogenic factors. Although placental defects are less pronounced in pregnancies resulting from the transfer of in vitro fertilized embryos, we and others have recently demonstrated that vascularization, expression of angiogenic factors, sex steroid receptors, several epigenetic markers, and growth of utero-placental tissues all were altered during early pregnancy after transfer of embryos obtained through natural mating, in vitro fertilization, or other assisted reproductive techniques. These observations are in agreement with the recent reports that in humans even singleton pregnancies established with assisted reproductive techniques are at increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight, and seem especially relevant considering the rapidly expanding use of these techniques in humans and animals.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2014-07-13", "authors": ["Lawrence PReynolds", "Pawel PBorowicz", "ChiaraPalmieri", "Anna TGrazul-Bilska"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-1031-1_17"}

However, limited data are available in the literature on actual patient outcomes, despite numerous reports of the technique. The purpose of this study was to report our experience with distal tibiofibular bone bridging using a vascularized fibular bone graft in an elderly nontrauma population.\nWe performed an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of BKAs performed by the senior author between 2004 and 2011. Surgical indications, complications, and outcomes were recorded. A subgroup analysis and comparison was performed among patients that had received vascularized bone bridging and those that had not.\nA total of 294 BKAs were performed on 270 nontrauma patients. Of these, 30 (11%) were done on 29 patients with tibiofibular bone bridging. The mean clinical follow-up among the Ertl subgroup was 11 months (range, 1-42 months), and 17 months (range, 23 days-78 months) in the non-Ertl subgroup. The ambulation rate was 100% (29/29) in the Ertl group, and 78% (161/207) in the control group (P = 0.004). The overall rate of operative revision due to any etiology among groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.255).\nTibiofibular bone bridging with vascularized fibula leads to a significantly higher rate of ambulation without a significantly higher rate of complications in a nontrauma population. Although this technique has been widely described in trauma patients, clinical data are lacking for the nontrauma population. This is the largest reported series of Ertl amputations in nontraumatic population to date and our results demonstrate a significant benefit of the Ertl technique in this population.\nLevel IV.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2014-07-12", "authors": ["Benjamin JBrown", "Matthew LIorio", "LaurenHill", "MitchKlement", "Michael RConti Mica", "AmineEl-Amraoui", "Christopher EAttinger"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e318273f740"}

Moreover, Decorin was maintained in the placentome tissues from SCNT pregnancies while both mRNA and protein were absent in AI derived placenta.\nIn bovine, the pattern of expression of Decorin exhibits significant changes during placental formation. Downregulation of Decorin is associated with proliferation, remodeling and vascularization of placental tissues.

However, previous experimental studies have also shown that DPO significantly enhances Phx-induced engraftment of colorectal liver metastases by increasing neovascularization and tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether DPO affects engraftment and neovascularization of extrahepatic colorectal metastases after major hepatectomy.\nGreen fluorescent protein-transfected CT26.WT colorectal cancer cells were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of syngeneic BALB/c mice. Animals received a single dose of DPO (10 \u00b5g/kg body weight) at the day of tumor cell implantation (day 0). Phosphate-buffered saline-treated animals served as controls. To study whether the effect of DPO is influenced by Phx, additional animals with and without DPO treatment underwent 70% Phx at day 0. Tumor vascularization and growth as well as tumor cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis were studied repetitively over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry.\nIn nonhepatectomized animals, DPO significantly accelerated tumor cell engraftment and slightly enhanced tumor neovascularization. Tumor cell migration and host tissue infiltration were not affected by DPO. In hepatectomized animals, DPO slightly enhanced tumor growth and significantly accelerated tumor neovascularization, but did not affect tumor cell migration and infiltration.\nThe present study indicates that DPO accelerates extrahepatic engraftment of colorectal cancer cells, most probably by stimulating the process of neovascularization.", "journal": "European surgical research.

In patients with postoperative infection related to the use of artificial dura mater, surgical debridement of the infected wound and removal of the artificial dura mater materials are necessary to control infection. In cases involving cerebrospinal fluid leakage, dura mater reconstruction must be performed immediately. Many useful techniques for performing dura mater reconstruction to treat postoperative infection have been reported; however, some have drawbacks with respect to the need for microvascular anastomosis or difficulties in obtaining watertight closure. We successfully treated 6 patients with postoperative artificial dura mater infection using free thigh fascia lata. Some surgeons believe that the use of free fascia in infected wounds is dangerous because free fascia is a non-vascularized tissue. However, performing complete debridement and covering such free fascia with well-vascularized tissue allow the fascia to become vascularized and tolerant of infection. Therefore, if the blood flow in the scalp is acceptable after a sufficient debridement, free fascia lata can be used for reconstruction in patients with postoperative infection of artificial dura mater.

During development, the vasculature forms via the dual processes of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and is regulated at multiple levels: from transcriptional hierarchies and protein interactions to inputs from the extracellular environment.

In this Review, we will discuss how the process of vascular development can be used to guide approaches to engineering vasculature. Specifically, we will focus on some of the recently reported approaches to stimulate therapeutic angiogenesis by recreating the embryonic vascular microenvironment using biomaterials for vascular engineering and regeneration.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-07-10", "authors": ["Kyung MinPark", "SharonGerecht"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.102194\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1073/pnas.1217796110\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.007\n10.1128/MCB.00036-13\n10.1038/nature10144\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1002/adfm.201101662\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.05.026\n10.1073/pnas.1210580109\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06718.x\n10.1002/smll.201300427\n10.1371/journal.pone.0066734\n10.1097/MOT.0b013e32833454b5\n10.1002/adfm.201200976\n10.1002/adma.201200395\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.048264\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.83\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2011.09.006\n10.1038/nrc2748\n10.3109/08977199309029135\n10.1016/j.ceb.2010.08.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.240622\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4635\n10.1002/stem.321\n10.1002/adma.201304847\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.10.020\n10.1242/dev.062323\n10.1074/jbc.M112.442939\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0285\n10.1007/s10544-012-9699-7\n10.1074/mcp.M113.030528\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00981.x\n10.1182/blood-2010-12-327338\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.027\n10.1126/science.3461562\n10.1083/jcb.141.3.805\n10.1016/j.ceb.2008.06.007\n10.1038/nature08601\n10.1016/j.scr.2013.09.006\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.013\n10.1073/pnas.0914248107\n10.1007/s00395-012-0310-4\n10.1093/ejcts/ezt017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058760\n10.1006/excr.2002.5561\n10.1152/ajpcell.00018.2009\n10.1021/bm301789d\n10.1038/428138a\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.005\n10.1038/nmeth.1671\n10.1073/pnas.1306562110\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021869\n10.1098/rsif.2010.0223\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.881441\n10.1172/JCI8071\n10.1038/nbt.2247\n10.1002/cbin.10097\n10.1182/blood-2008-06-162891\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.022\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002614\n10.1073/pnas.1221602110\n10.1039/c3bm00166k\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178590\n10.1093/abbs/gmr094\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60141-5\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0196\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.104\n10.1038/nprot.2013.110\n10.1038/nmat3766\n10.1172/JCI35298\n10.1038/ncb2679\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104315\n10.1073/pnas.1221526110\n10.1038/ncomms5075\n10.1039/c1jm12527c\n10.1242/dev.01310\n10.1242/jcs.003533\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.07.009\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1007/s10544-012-9679-y\n10.1073/pnas.1310675110\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.046\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083755\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.12.020\n10.1007/s12013-007-0046-1\n10.1038/nrm2354\n10.1038/nature05383\n10.1002/adfm.201303217\n10.1017/S1431927611012402\n10.1182/blood-2008-12-196451\n10.1182/blood-2010-11-316752\n10.1073/pnas.1115973108\n10.1242/dev.092551\n10.1074/jbc.M411913200\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.182162\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61450-6\n10.1021/ma302522x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.063\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.190926\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.050\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058897\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017771\n10.1093/cvr/cvs315\n10.1038/nmat3132\n10.1073/pnas.1209905110\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0481\n10.1073/pnas.1216890110\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.003\n10.1073/pnas.1201240109\n10.1007/s10456-013-9395-0"}

The meniscus provides joint stability and is involved in the early pathological progress of OA. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) has been used to identify pre-radiographic changes in the cartilage in OA, but has been used less commonly to examine the meniscus, and then using only a double dose of the contrast agent. The purpose of this study was to enable improved early OA diagnosis by investigate the temporal contrast agent distribution in the meniscus and femoral cartilage simultaneously, in healthy volunteers, using 3D dGEMRIC at two different doses of the contrast agent Gd-DTPA2-.\nThe right knee in 12 asymptomatic volunteers was examined using a 3D Look-Locker sequence on two occasions after an intravenous injection of a double or triple dose of Gd-DTPA2- (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg body weight). The relaxation time (T1) and relaxation rate (R1 = 1/T1) were measured in the meniscus and femoral cartilage before, and 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after injection, and the change in relaxation rate (\u0394R1) was calculated. Paired t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical evaluation.\nThe triple dose yielded higher concentrations of Gd-DTPA2- in the meniscus and cartilage than the double dose, but provided no additional information. The observed patterns of \u0394R1 were similar for double and triple doses of the contrast agent. \u0394R1 was higher in the meniscus than in femoral cartilage in the corresponding compartments at all time points after injection. \u0394R1 increased until 90-180 minutes in both the cartilage and the meniscus (p < 0.05), and was lower in the medial than in the lateral meniscus at all time points (p < 0.05). A faster increase in \u0394R1 was observed in the vascularized peripheral region of the posterior medial meniscus, than in the avascular central part of the posterior medial meniscus during the first 60 minutes (p < 0.05).\nIt is feasible to examine undamaged meniscus and cartilage simultaneously using dGEMRIC, preferably 90 minutes after the injection of a double dose of Gd-DTPA2- (0.2 mmol/kg body weight).", "journal": "BMC musculoskeletal disorders", "date": "2014-07-10", "authors": ["UlfSigurdsson", "CarlSiversson", "EveliinaLammentausta", "JonasSvensson", "Carl-JohanTiderius", "Leif EDahlberg"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2474-15-226\n10.1016/S1063-4584(05)80017-2\n10.1016/0021-9290(72)90030-9\n10.1302/0301-620X.81B4.9667\n10.1177/0363546508316770\n10.1177/0363546509361018\n10.1007/s00167-008-0498-x\n10.3109/03008208709005619\n10.1136/ard.43.4.635\n10.1089/107632703762687492\n10.1053/joca.1997.0090\n10.1016/j.joca.2010.06.011\n10.1002/mrm.1300\n10.1002/mrm.10389\n10.1016/0009-9120(92)90250-V\n10.1148/radiol.11101841\n10.1073/pnas.0707666105\n10.1002/mrm.1910360504\n10.1148/radiology.205.2.9356644\n10.1002/art.22592\n10.1016/j.joca.2006.03.005\n10.1148/radiology.214.1.r00ja15259\n10.1016/j.joca.2007.01.011\n10.1002/1522-2594(200101)45:1<36::AID-MRM1006>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1016/j.joca.2006.05.007\n10.1177/002215540205000807\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.05.008\n10.1002/ar.21296\n10.1002/jor.20869\n10.1007/s001670050125\n10.1016/j.joca.2011.05.008"}
{"title": "Aesthetic reconstruction of the upper lip with novel split musculomucosal-pedicle cross-lip flap.", "abstract": "The upper lip can be divided into aesthetic subunits. Accordingly, we classified the upper lip defect into 3 categories: medial subunit defect, lateral subunit defect, and cross-subunit defect. The defect should be repaired aesthetically. We developed an innovative partial-thickness myocutaneous flap based on the vascular network of the submucosal and subcutaneous layers. The flap was more flexible for aesthetic reconstruction of the upper lip, even the fine anatomic structures.\nFor three and a half years, a total of 59 patients were used with this new technique, including those with secondary deformities from bilateral cleft lip, postinjury upper lip defects, and posthemangioma treatment defects. The inclusion criteria were that the defects of the upper lip were within 2.0 cm in adults and 1.5 cm in children generally. The split flap was elevated from the posterior portion of the orbicularis oris muscle after the inferior labial artery was divided. The flap was supplied by the vascular network derived mainly from the horizontal labiomental artery and/or the vertical labiomental artery.\nAll 59 cases of musculomucosal-pedicle flaps were viable. The upper lip was reconstructed according to the aesthetic subunits. In some cases, the fine anatomic structures were reconstructed, including the philtral column, the philtral dimple, curve of the Cupid's bow, and vermilion tubercle. The patients were all satisfied with their appearance.\nThis myocutaneous cross-lip flap with musculomucosal-pedicle is an effective method for aesthetic reconstruction of the upper lip.

{"title": "Effect of nano-structured bioceramic surface on osteogenic differentiation of adipose derived stem cells.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering strategies to construct vascularized bone grafts potentially revolutionize the treatment of massive bone loss. The surface topography of the grafts plays critical roles on bone regeneration, while adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) are known for their capability to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis when applied to bone defects. In the present study, the effects of hydroxyapatite (HAp) bioceramic scaffolds with nanosheet, nanorod, and micro-nano-hybrid (the hybrid of nanorod and microrod) surface topographies on attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, as well as the expression of angiogenic factors of rat ASCs were systematically investigated. The results showed that the HAp bioceramic scaffolds with the micro-/nano-topography surfaces significantly enhanced cell attachment and viability, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mRNA expression levels of osteogenic markers and angiogenic factors of ASCs. More importantly, the biomimetic feature of the hierarchical micro-nano-hybrid surface topography showed the highest stimulatory effect. The activation in Akt signaling pathway was observed in ASCs cultured on HAp bioceramics with nanorod, and micro-nano-hybrid surface topographies. Moreover, these induction effects could be repressed by Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002. Finally, the in vivo bone regeneration results of rat critical-sized calvarial defect models confirmed that the combination of the micro-nano-hybrid surface and ASCs could significantly enhance both osteogenesis and angiogenesis as compared with the control HAp bioceramic scaffold with traditional smooth surface. Our results suggest that HAp bioceramic scaffolds with micro-nano-hybrid surface can act as cell carrier for ASCs, and consequently combine with ASCs to construct vascularized tissue-engineered bone.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-07-09", "authors": ["LunguoXia", "KailiLin", "XinquanJiang", "BingFang", "YuanjinXu", "JiaqiangLiu", "DeliangZeng", "MaolinZhang", "XiuliZhang", "JiangChang", "ZhiyuanZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.06.028"}

ES head and neck bone localization is extremely uncommon (2 to 4%). We report a rapid induced membrane reconstruction without primary bone autograft.\nA 7-year-old boy presented with a 50mm mandibular ES centered on the horizontal branch of the right mandible. This patient was treated by a combination of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant radio-chemotherapy, according to the Euro-Ewing 99 protocol. The right horizontal mandibular branch was resected, following induction chemotherapy. A macroplate and a cement spacer were used for the reconstruction, while expecting anatomopathological results. Seventeen days later, we removed the spacer because of scar disunion. The radiographic controls revealed a spontaneous osteogenesis along the macroplate despite the early cement spacer removal. This spontaneously bone growth allowed avoiding a free vascularized bone transfer for the reconstruction. The tissue regeneration potential of this young boy and the cement spacer induced membrane could explain this spontaneous osteogenesis phenomenon.\nInduced membrane can be added to the therapeutic options for pediatric oncologic mandibular bone loss.

{"title": "The role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Since the approval of the multityrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer and Onyx) as the standard of care for intermediate to advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there has been considerable interest in developing more potent TKIs to improve morbidity and mortality for patients with HCC. Much of the research on TKIs targets pathways implicated in angiogenesis, given that HCC is a highly vascularized cancer type. It was theorized that the efficacy of sorafenib is primarily attributable to its angiogenesis targets-namely, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, FLT-3, and RAF kinases. Over the past 2 years, several pivotal phase 3 trials of newer TKIs targeting similar pathways have failed to meet criteria for superiority or noninferiority to sorafenib. Reasons for this may stem from the genetic and biologic heterogeneity of HCC. Genomic studies of tumor samples have shown scarce uniformity in kinase mutations, underscoring the variability that exists in HCC. This beckons the question of whether efforts should shift to other potential targets, either within the realm of TKIs or other targets entirely. Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as those encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, are expressed in certain individuals and have shown to be susceptible to targeted TKIs. As researchers continue to investigate therapies, the goal is to further research efforts into culprit oncogenes that mediate tumor progression, which will likely lead to more personalized and targeted regimens.", "journal": "Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O", "date": "2014-07-08", "authors": ["SunnieKim", "Ghassan KAbou-Alfa"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Overexpression of Wnt5a promotes angiogenesis in NSCLC.", "abstract": "To evaluate Wnt5a expression and its role in angiogenesis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), immunohistochemistry and CD31/PAS double staining were performed to examine the Wnt5a expression and we analyze the relationships between Wnt5a and microvessel density (MVD), vasculogenic mimicry (VM), and some related proteins. About 61.95% of cases of 205 NSCLC specimens exhibited high expression of Wnt5a. Wnt5a expression level was upregulated in the majority of NSCLC tissues, especially in squamous cell carcinoma, while its expression level in adenocarcinoma was the lowest. Wnt5a was also found more frequently expressed in male patients than in female patients. Except for histological classification and gender, little association was found between Wnt5a and clinicopathological features. Moreover, Wnt5a was significantly correlated with prognosis. Overall, Wnt5a-positive expression in patients with NSCLC indicated shorter survival time. As for vascularization in NSCLC, Wnt5a showed close association with VM and MVD. In addition, Wnt5a was positively related with \u03b2 -catenin-nu, VE-cadherin, MMP2, and MMP9. The results demonstrated that overexpression of Wnt5a may play an important role in NSCLC angiogenesis and it may function via canonical Wnt signal pathway.

{"title": "In vitro osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell spheroids impairs their in vivo vascularization capacity inside implanted porous polyurethane scaffolds.", "abstract": "Undifferentiated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (adMSC) spheroids are attractive vascularization units for tissue engineering. Their osteogenic differentiation further offers the possibility of directed generation of bone constructs. The aim of this study was to analyze how this differentiation affects their in vivo vascularization capacity. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive adMSCs were isolated from C57BL/6-TgN(ACTB-EGFP)1Osb/J mice for the generation of undifferentiated and differentiated spheroids using the liquid overlay technique. Subsequently, polyurethane scaffolds were seeded with these spheroids and successful osteogenic differentiation was proven by von Kossa staining and high-resolution microtomography. The scaffolds were then implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of C57BL/6 wild-type mice to analyze their vascularization and incorporation using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. Scaffolds seeded with differentiated spheroids exhibited a markedly impaired vascularization. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that this was caused by the lost ability of differentiated spheroids to form GFP-positive microvascular networks inside the scaffolds. This was associated with a reduced tissue incorporation of the implants. Moreover, they no longer exhibited a mineralized matrix after the 14day implantation period, indicating the dedifferentiation of the spheroids under the given in vivo conditions. These findings indicate that osteogenic differentiation of adMSC spheroids markedly impairs their vascularization capacity. Hence, it may be reasonable to combine adMSC spheroids of varying differentiation stages in scaffolds for bone tissue engineering to promote both vascularization and bone formation.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-07-08", "authors": ["Matthias WLaschke", "Timo ESchank", "ClaudiaScheuer", "SaschaKleer", "TakhirjanShadmanov", "DavidEglin", "MauroAlini", "Michael DMenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.06.035"}

Pre- and post-craniometric measurements were performed for the endocranial bifrontal angle, orbital plane angle, anterior advancement and the interzygomaticofrontal suture distance.\n40 CT scans were analyzed, with similar demographics. No perioperative complications were encountered. The endocranial bifrontal angle increased in the FOA (p = 0.00026) and tilt groups (p = 0.00297), along with the orbital plane angles (FOA, p = 0.020498; tilt, p = 0.07371), the anterior advancement (FOA, p = 0.00932; tilt, p = 0.05823), and the interzygomaticofrontal suture distance (FOA, p = 0.001241; tilt, p = 0.07811).\nBoth techniques improve frontoorbital dimensions for correction of metopic synostosis.

Watertight reconstruction of vascularized tissue is essential to prevent postoperative liquorrhea, especially under conditions that prevent wound healing (e.g., postoperative irradiation therapy).\nWe successfully treated two cases of olfactory neuroblastoma by endoscopic-assisted craniotomy with primary dural closure and anterior cranial base reconstruction using a multi-layered flap technique. Dural defects were closed using temporal fascia or fascia lata in a conventional fashion, immediately after detaching the subdural tumor, in order to isolate and prevent contamination of subdural components and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the tumor and nasal sinuses. Tumor removal and anterior cranial base reconstruction were performed without any concern of CSF contamination after dural closure by craniotomy and endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA). Vascularized pericranial flaps (PCF) and nasoseptal flaps (NSF) were used simultaneously as doubled-over layers for reconstruction.\nThe tumor was completely removed macroscopically and the anterior cranial base was reconstructed in both cases. CSF leak and postoperative meningitis were absent. Postoperative and irradiation therapy courses were successful and uneventful.\nThis multi-layered anterior cranial base reconstruction consisted of three layers: a fascia for dural plasty and double-layered PCF and NSF.

The first case was in a 9-year-old boy who presented with a 6-month history of neck pain and repeated paroxysmal vomiting. Based on preoperative radiographic findings, the initial diagnosis was of an intraaxial medulla oblongata hemangioblastoma. Intraoperatively, the cystic component of the tumor was gray, gelatinous, and soft in consistency. The solid component was light pink, rubbery, and nodular in appearance, with an identifiable boundary. The lesion was completely removed. Histopathological investigation revealed a mature teratoma. Postoperatively, the patient was supported with ventilator assistance and received a tracheotomy, but died of intracranial infection. The second case was in a 10-year-old boy with intermittent headache for 1 month. Radiographs revealed an exophytic cystic and solid lesion with dorsal involvement of the medulla oblongata. The lesion was predominantly solid, pinkish gray, tenacious, and moderately vascularized, with clearly delineated surgical dissection planes. The histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of immature teratoma. Total resection was achieved, followed by postoperative chemotherapy. He was alive without recurrence of the lesion or symptoms at 59 months after surgery. Resection of medulla oblongata teratoma is challenging, with inherent surgical risks that are contingent on the tumor growth pattern. Teratomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of brainstem lesions. Chemotherapy has been suggested for immature teratomas.

Supernatant of BMMSC (P4-P6) was collected for exosome purification. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot were used to identify the quality of isolated exosomes. The amount of exosomes was quantified through bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated from healthy donor and added with isolating exosomes. After co-cultured for 72 h, IFN-\u03b3 from the co-culture system was detected by ELISA. The expression of miRNA-associated with immunity were detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Real-time RT-PCR). The interactions between exosomes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were observed with confocal microscopy. Subconfluent HUVEC were harvested and treated with the indicated concentration of exosomes. Nude mice were injected subcutaneously with exosomes or PBS as control to verify the ability of angiogenesis. The results showed that diameter range of exosomes was range from 40 to 160 nm. The isolated exosomes expressed the CD9. There was approximately linear relation between the secretion of exosomes and cell density. The exosomes suppressed the production of IFN-\u03b3 from PBMNC, and contained miRNA associated with immune regulation such as miR301, miR22 and miR-let-7a.

Flexible gateways were structurally similar to compressed plasmodesmata but were able to accommodate complete SRBSDV virions (~80 nm diameter). Virions were also found in sieve-pore gateways, providing strong evidence for the movement of a virus with large virions within phloem tissue and suggesting that the unusual neovascularization of plant virus-induced tumours facilitated virus spread.

TM4SF1 is an attractive cancer target because of its high expression in both tumor cells and on the vascular endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels. We generated mouse monoclonal antibodies against human TM4SF1 in order to evaluate their therapeutic potential; 13 of the antibodies we generated reacted with extracellular loop-2 (EL2), TM4SF1's larger extracellular, lumen-facing domain. However, none of these antibodies reacted with mouse TM4SF1, likely because the EL2 of mouse TM4SF1 differs significantly from that of its human counterpart. Therefore, to test our antibodies in vivo, we employed an established model of engineered human vessels in which human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are incorporated into Matrigel plugs that are implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient nude mice. We modified the original protocol by (1) preculturing human ECFC on laminin, fibronectin, and collagen-coated plates, and (2) increasing the ECFC/MSC ratio. These modifications significantly increased the human vascular network in Matrigel implants. Two injections of one of our anti-TM4SF1 EL2 monoclonal antibodies, 8G4, effectively eliminated the human vascular component present in these plugs; they also abrogated human PC3 prostate cancer cells that were incorporated into the ECFC/MSC Matrigel mix.

A multifunctional injectable vehicle for the co-delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and osteoinductive peptides is proposed, to specifically direct hMSCs osteogenic differentiation. The osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) inspired the design of two peptides, where the bioactive portion of OGP was flanked by a protease-sensitive linker, or its scrambled sequence, to provide faster and slower release rates, respectively. Peptides were fully characterized and chemically grafted to alginate. Both OGP analogs released bioactive fragments in vitro, at different kinetics, which stimulated hMSCs proliferation and osteogenesis. hMSCs-laden OGP-alginate hydrogels were tested at an ectopic site in a xenograft mouse model. After 4weeks, OGP-alginate hydrogels were more degraded and colonized by vascularized connective tissue than the control (without OGP). hMSCs were able to proliferate, migrate outward the hydrogels, produce endogenous extracellular matrix and mineralize it. Moreover, OGP-groups stimulated hMSCs osteogenesis, as compared with the control. Overall, the ability of the proposed platform to direct the fate of transplanted hMSCs in loco was demonstrated, and OGP-releasing hydrogels emerged as a potentially useful system to promote bone regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-07-01", "authors": ["F RaquelMaia", "MarianaBarbosa", "David BGomes", "NunoVale", "PaulaGomes", "Pedro LGranja", "Cristina CBarrias"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.06.030"}

Although not completely understood, the pathophysiology of the disease involves chronic dysregulation of inflammatory and vascular signalling. In the quest for novel therapeutic targets, we investigated the involvement of galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein endowed with both immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic activities, in the pathophysiology of endometriotic lesions. Here we show that Gal-1 is selectively expressed in stromal and endothelial cells of human endometriotic lesions. Using an experimental endometriosis model induced in wild-type and Gal-1-deficient (Lgals1(-/-) ) mice, we showed that this lectin orchestrates the formation of vascular networks in endometriotic lesions in vivo, facilitating their ectopic growth independently of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the keratinocyte-derived CXC-motif (CXC-KC) chemokine. Targeting Gal-1 using a specific neutralizing mAb reduced the size and vascularized area of endometriotic lesions within the peritoneal compartment. These results underline the essential role of Gal-1 during endometriosis and validate this lectin as a possible target for the treatment of disease.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2014-07-01", "authors": ["Juan IBast\u00f3n", "Rosa IBara\u00f1ao", "Anal\u00eda GRicci", "Mariela ABilotas", "Carla NOlivares", "Jos\u00e9 JSingla", "Alejandro MGonzalez", "Juan CStupirski", "Diego OCroci", "Gabriel ARabinovich", "Gabriela FMeresman"], "doi": "10.1002/path.4397"}

There is a need to identify reliable predictors of complication risk to help inform patients and clinicians in preparation for surgery. Unfortunately, body mass index and serum albumin may not be reliable predictors of complication rates. Analytic morphomics provides a robust quantitative method to measure patients' obesity as it pertains to their risk of complications in undergoing sternal reconstruction.\nWe identified 34 patients with preoperative computed tomography scans of the abdomen from a cohort of sternal reconstructions performed between 1997 and 2010. Using semiautomated analytic morphomics, we identified the patients' skin and fascia layers between the ninth and 12th thoracic spine levels; from these landmarks, we calculated morphomic measurements of the patients' abdomens, including their total body cross sectional area and the cross sectional area of their subcutaneous fat. We obtained the incidence of complications from chart review and correlated the incidence of complications (including seroma, hematoma, recurrent wounds, mediastinitis, tracheostomy, and death) with patients' morphomic measurements.\nSixty-two percent of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a021) suffered complications after their operation. Those who suffered from complications, relative to those who did not have complications, had increased visceral fat area (12,547.2\u00a0mm(2)versus 6569.9\u00a0mm(2), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0080), subcutaneous fat area (16,520.2\u00a0mm(2)versus 8020.1\u00a0mm(2), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0036), total body area (91,028.6\u00a0mm(2)versus 67,506.5\u00a0mm(2), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0022), fascia area (69,238.4\u00a0mm(2)versus 56,730.9\u00a0mm(2), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0118), total body circumference (1101.8\u00a0mm versus 950.2\u00a0mm, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0017), and fascia circumference (967.5\u00a0mm versus 868.1\u00a0mm, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0077).

We defined quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the Intermated B73 \u00d7 Mo17 recombinant inbred maize (Zea mays) population using pyrolysis molecular-beam mass spectrometry to establish stem lignin content and an enzymatic hydrolysis assay to measure glucose and xylose yield. Among five multiyear QTL for lignin abundance, two for 4-vinylphenol abundance, and four for glucose and/or xylose yield, not a single QTL for aromatic abundance and sugar yield was shared. A genome-wide association study for lignin abundance and sugar yield of the 282-member maize association panel provided candidate genes in the 11 QTL of the B73 and Mo17 parents but showed that many other alleles impacting these traits exist among this broader pool of maize genetic diversity. B73 and Mo17 genotypes exhibited large differences in gene expression in developing stem tissues independent of allelic variation. Combining these complementary genetic approaches provides a narrowed list of candidate genes. A cluster of SCARECROW-LIKE9 and SCARECROW-LIKE14 transcription factor genes provides exceptionally strong candidate genes emerging from the genome-wide association study. In addition to these and genes associated with cell wall metabolism, candidates include several other transcription factors associated with vascularization and fiber formation and components of cellular signaling pathways.

Such computer-controlled methods assemble 3D objects by layer-wise deposition or layer-wise cross-linking of materials. They use, for example, nozzle-based deposition of hydrogels and cells, drop-on-demand inkjet-printing of cell suspensions with subsequent cross-linking, layer-by-layer cross-linking of synthetic or biological polymers by selective irradiation with light and even laser-induced deposition of single cells. The need of vessel-like structures has become increasingly crucial for the supply of encapsulated cells for 3D tissue engineering, or even with regard to future application such as vascular grafts. The anticipated potential of providing tubes with tailored branching geometries made of biocompatible or biological materials pushes future visions of patient-specific vascularized tissue substitutions, tissue-engineered blood vessels and bio-based vascular grafts. We review here the early attempts of bringing together innovative free-form manufacturing processes with bio-based and biodegradable materials. The presented studies provide many important proofs of concepts such as the possibility to integrate viable cells into computer-controlled processes and the feasibility of supplying cells in a hydrogel matrix by generation of a network of perfused channels. Several impressive results in the generation of complex shapes and high-aspect-ratio tubular structures demonstrate the potential of additive assembly methods.

One hundred fifteen patients (median age, 34 years; age range, 14-61 years) with nonpalpable testicular lesions were consecutively enrolled between 2006 and 2012 and underwent unenhanced scrotal US, contrast-enhanced US, surgical enucleation, and at least 18 months of follow-up. Clinical and histologic features were recorded, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced US time-intensity curves were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore features of malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC receiver operating characteristic ) curves were developed for cumulative unenhanced and contrast-enhanced US scores.\nAll lesions were 1.5 cm or smaller. Forty-four of the 115 patients (38%) had malignant tumors, 42 had benign tumors (37%), and 29 (25%) had nonneoplastic lesions.

This study is based on an in vitro coculture model consisting of outgrowth endothelial cells and primary osteoblasts and is currently being used in different studies of bone repair processes with special regard to angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Coculture systems of OECs and pOBs positively influence the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells by inducing the formation of angiogenic structures in long-term cultures.

{"title": "Dynamic auxin transport patterns preceding vein formation revealed by live-imaging of Arabidopsis leaf primordia.", "abstract": "Self-regulatory patterning mechanisms capable of generating biologically meaningful, yet unpredictable cellular patterns offer unique opportunities for obtaining mathematical descriptions of underlying patterning systems properties. The networks of higher-order veins in leaf primordia constitute such a self-regulatory system. During the formation of higher-order veins, vascular precursors are selected from a homogenous field of subepidermal cells in unpredictable positions to eventually connect in complex cellular networks. Auxin transport routes have been implicated in this selection process, but understanding of their role in vascular patterning has been limited by our inability to monitor early auxin transport dynamics in vivo. Here we describe a live-imaging system in emerging Arabidopsis thaliana leaves that uses a PIN1:GFP reporter to visualize auxin transport routes and an Athb8:YFP reporter as a marker for vascular commitment. Live-imaging revealed common features initiating the formation of all higher-order veins. The formation of broad PIN1 expression domains is followed by their restriction, leading to sustained, elevated PIN1 expression in incipient procambial cells files, which then express Athb8. Higher-order PIN1 expression domains (hPEDs) are initiated as freely ending domains that extend toward each other and sometimes fuse with them, creating connected domains. During the restriction and specification phase, cells in wider hPEDs are partitioned into vascular and non-vascular fates: Central cells acquire a coordinated cell axis and express elevated PIN1 levels as well as the pre-procambial marker Athb8, while edge cells downregulate PIN1 and remain isodiametric. The dynamic nature of the early selection process is underscored by the instability of early hPEDs, which can result in dramatic changes in vascular network architecture prior to Athb8 expression, which is correlated with the promotion onto vascular cell fate.", "journal": "Frontiers in plant science", "date": "2014-06-27", "authors": ["DanielleMarcos", "ThomasBerleth"], "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2014.00235\n10.1104/pp.126.2.643\n10.1101/gad.497009\n10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.005\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00924-3\n10.1016/j.pbi.2005.07.014\n10.1105/tpc.13.3.495\n10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02892.x\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80682-0\n10.1242/dev.037028\n10.2307/2437246\n10.2307/2438624\n10.1038/nature02085\n10.1105/tpc.017962\n10.1093/emboj/17.5.1405\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000516\n10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.052\n10.1104/pp.70.4.1044\n10.1104/pp.013623\n10.1105/tpc.9.7.1121\n10.1126/science.1123542\n10.2307/2438589\n10.1242/dev.01261\n10.1038/nature02081\n10.1101/gad.390806\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1003294\n10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02193.x\n10.1242/dev.01182\n10.1101/gad.1402406\n10.1073/pnas.89.9.3894\n10.1023/A:1006016319613\n10.1242/dev.02027\n10.1126/science.1121356\n10.1126/science.1121790\n10.1007/s00018-007-6566-4"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of computer-assisted surgery in primary mandibular reconstruction with an iliac crest bone flap compared with an osteomyocutaneous fibula flap.\nPreoperative computed tomography data of the mandible and the iliac crest or fibula donor site were imported into a specific surgical planning software program. Surgical guides were manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique for translating the virtual plan, including information on the transplant dimensions and shape, into real-time surgery. Using postoperative computed tomography scans and an automatic surface-comparison algorithm, the actual postoperative situation was compared with the preoperative virtual simulation.\nThe actual flap position showed a mean difference from the virtual plan of 2.43 mm (standard deviation [SD] \u00b11.26) and a surface deviation of 39% <2 mm and 15% <1 mm for the iliac crest bone flap, and a mean difference of 2.18 mm (SD \u00b11.93) and a surface deviation of 60% <2 mm and 37% <1 mm for the osteomyocutaneous fibula flap. The position of the neomandible reconstructed with an osteomyocutaneous fibula flap indicated a mean difference from the virtual plan of 1.25 mm (SD \u00b11.31) and a surface deviation of 82% <2 mm and 57% <1 mm, in contrast to a mean difference of 1.68 mm (SD \u00b11.25) and a surface deviation of 63% <2 mm and 38% <1 mm for the neomandible after reconstruction with an iliac crest bone flap. For shape analysis, a similarly high accuracy could be calculated for both flaps.\nVirtual surgical planning is an effective method for mandibular reconstruction with vascularized bone flaps, and can help to restore the anatomy of the mandible with high accuracy in position and shape.

It was shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could modulate factors involved in tissue vascularization. A congenital deficiency in ether-phospholipids, also termed \"plasmalogens\", was shown to lead to abnormal ocular vascularization. Because plasmalogens are considered to be reservoirs of PUFAs, we wished to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which plasmalogens regulate retinal vascular development and whether the release of PUFAs by calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) could be involved.\nBy characterizing the cellular and molecular steps of retinal vascular development in a mouse model of plasmalogen deficiency, we demonstrated that plasmalogens modulate angiogenic processes during the early phases of retinal vascularization. They influence glial activity and primary astrocyte template formation, endothelial cell proliferation and retinal vessel outgrowth, and impact the expression of the genes involved in angiogenesis in the retina. These early defects led to a disorganized and dysfunctional retinal vascular network at adult age. By comparing these data to those obtained on a mouse model of retinal iPLA2 inhibition, we suggest that these processes may be mediated by PUFAs released from plasmalogens and further signalling through the angiopoietin/tie pathways.\nThese data suggest that plasmalogens play a crucial role in retinal vascularization processes.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-06-26", "authors": ["SarahSaab", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicteButeau", "LaurentLecl\u00e8re", "Alain MBron", "Catherine PCreuzot-Garcher", "LionelBretillon", "NiyaziAcar"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0101076"}

In this study, we propose a scalable and flexible 3D system based on microsized hydrogel fibers that might be used as building blocks for the establishment of 3D hydrogel constructs for vascularized bone TE applications. For this purpose, chitosan (CHT) coated \u03ba-carrageenan (\u03ba-CA) microfibers were developed using a two-step procedure involving ionotropic gelation (for the fiber formation) of \u03ba-CA and its polyelectrolyte complexation with CHT (for the enhancement of fiber stability). The performance of the obtained fibers was assessed regarding their swelling and stability profiles, as well as their ability to carry and, subsequently, promote the outward release of microvascular-like endothelial cells (ECs), without compromising their viability and phenotype. Finally, the possibility of assembling and integrating these cell-laden fibers within a 3D hydrogel matrix containing osteoblast-like cells was evaluated. Overall, the obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the microsized \u03ba-CA fibers to carry and deliver phenotypically apt microvascular-like ECs. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to assemble these cell-laden microsized fibers into 3D heterotypic hydrogels constructs.

This study is designed with the two-fold aims of verifying the feasibility of non-viral oligonucleotide delivery for the cell sheets and confirming the osteogenesis enhancing effect of antimiR-138 on the cell sheets composed of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The BMSC sheets are fabricated by a vitamin C inducing method, which can be successfully delivered with the oligonucleotides with a high delivery efficiency of nearly 100% by the properly adapted and optimized Lipofactamine2000 based formulation. The antimiR-138 delivery significantly enhances the in\u00a0vitro osteogenic differentiation of BMSC sheets, indicated by the higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production, denser extracellular matrix mineralization and up-regulated osteogenesis related genes including runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2), osterix, ALP, osteocalcin and bone morphogenetic protein-2 at both mRNA and protein levels, compared to controls. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the antimiR-138 delivery down-regulates the endogenous miR-138 levels in the BMSC sheets, consequently activates the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 pathway and enhances the RUNX2 expression.

Doxazosin inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and downstream signaling, including PI3K, Akt, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1). However, it had no effect on VEGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Furthermore, doxazosin reduced tumor growth and suppressed tumor vascularization in a xenograft human ovarian cancer model. These results provide evidence that doxazosin functions in the endothelial cell system to modulate angiogenesis by inhibiting Akt and mTOR phosphorylation and interacting with VEGFR-2.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2014-06-24", "authors": ["Mi SunPark", "Boh-RamKim", "Seung MyungDong", "Seung-HoonLee", "Dae-YongKim", "Seung BaeRho"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.2064"}

However, allograft chondrocyte death due to apoptosis may occur during storage or as a result of implantation stress. We investigated a third possible cause, chondrocyte apoptosis resulting from an immune response, by means of composite tissue allografting, thus eliminating the role of storage and implantation stresses on osteochondral grafts.\nVascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (from Fisher 344 to Lewis rat strains) and isotransplantation (from Lewis to Lewis strains) of rat hind limbs were performed. Immunohistochemistry was performed with use of caspase-3 and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assays. Analyses were performed immediately after perfusion (day zero) and on postoperative days one, three, seven, twelve, and eighteen (n = 5 for immunohistochemistry). Transmission electron microscopy was used for detection of chondrocyte apoptosis. Laser capture microdissection followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays was used for analysis of postoperative caspase-3 gene expression.\nCaspase-3 immunochemistry was increasingly positive in allograft chondrocytes from postoperative day seven onward. In contrast, caspase-3 gene expression decreased in all allografts. TUNEL assays showed increasing apoptosis of allograft chondrocytes, and electron microscopy also revealed evidence supporting the development of apoptosis.\nImmunorejection of chondrocytes in transplanted cartilage has been thought to be unlikely, but our data reveal that chondrocytes can undergo apoptosis in allotransplantation. This apoptosis involves the caspase-3 cascade and indicates that chondrocytes may induce acute rejection.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), vascular-like channels which are lack of the involvement of endothelial cells, has been observed in aggressive cancers and also involves in tumor vascularization. Breast cancer stem/progenitor cells (BCSCs) have been identified as a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with markers of CD24(-)CD44(+), high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(+)) or could be enriched by mammosphere cultivation. These cells have been proven to be associated with tumor vascularization. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms in VM activity of BCSCs. By periodic acid-Schiff or hematoxylin-eosin stain, we found that there were VM structures in two xenografted human breast cancer tissues established from CD24(-)CD44(+) or ALDH(+) cells. Only ALDH(+) or mammosphere-forming BCSCs could form tube structures on matrigel-coated surface as similar as microvascular endothelial cells. Inhibition of the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by gefitinib or knockdown of EGFR by lentiviral shRNA abolished the in\u00a0vitro VM activity of BCSCs. By quercetin treatment, a plant flavonoid compound which is known to suppress heat shock proteins, or siRNA-mediated gene silencing, both Hsp27 expression and VM capability of BCSCs were suppressed. Forced expression of phosphor-mimic form of Hsp27 in ALDH(+) BCSCs could overcome the inhibitory effect of gefitinib. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that VM activity of BCSCs is mediated by EGF/Hsp27 signaling and targeting this pathway may benefit to breast cancer therapy.", "journal": "Biochimie", "date": "2014-06-21", "authors": ["Che-HsinLee", "Yu-TingWu", "Hung-ChunHsieh", "YunYu", "Alice LYu", "Wen-WeiChang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.011"}

Although its etiology is still unknown, recent genome-wide and locus-specific association studies identified RNF213 as an important susceptibility gene of moyamoya disease among East Asian population. A polymorphism in c.14576G>A in RNF213 was identified in 95% of familial patients with moyamoya disease and 79% of sporadic cases, and patients having this polymorphism were found to have significantly earlier disease onset and a more severe form of moyamoya disease, such as the presentation of cerebral infarction and posterior cerebral artery stenosis. The exact mechanism by which the RNF213 abnormality relates to moyamoya disease remains unknown, while recent reports using genetically engineered mice lacking RNF213 by homologous recombination provide new insight for the pathogenesis of this rare entity. Regarding biomarkers of moyamoya disease, moyamoya disease is characterized by an increased expression of angiogenic factors and pro-inflammatory molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factors and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which may partly explain its clinical manifestations of the pathologic angiogenesis, spontaneous hemorrhage, and higher incidence of cerebral hyperperfusion after revascularization surgery. More recently, blockade of these pro-inflammatory molecules during perioperative period is attempted to reduce the potential risk of surgical complication including cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome.

{"title": "Essential role of the ERK/MAPK pathway in blood-placental barrier formation.", "abstract": "The mammalian genome contains two ERK/MAP kinase kinase genes, Map2k1 and Map2k2, which encode dual-specificity kinases responsible for ERK activation. Loss of Map2k1 function in mouse causes embryonic lethality due to placental defects, whereas Map2k2 mutants have a normal lifespan. The majority of Map2k1(+/-) Map2k2(+/-) embryos die during gestation from the underdevelopment of the placenta labyrinth, demonstrating that both kinases are involved in placenta formation. Map2k1(+/-) Map2k2(+/-) mutants show reduced vascularization of the labyrinth and defective formation of syncytiotrophoblast layer II (SynT-II) leading to the accumulation of multinucleated trophoblast giant cells (MTGs). To define the cell type-specific contribution of the ERK/MAPK pathway to placenta development, we performed deletions of Map2k1 function in different Map2k1 Map2k2 allelic backgrounds. Loss of MAP kinase kinase activity in pericytes or in allantois-derived tissues worsens the MTG phenotype. These results define the contribution of the ERK/MAPK pathway in specific embryonic and extraembryonic cell populations for normal placentation. Our data also indicate that MTGs could result from the aberrant fusion of SynT-I and -II. Using mouse genetics, we demonstrate that the normal development of SynT-I into a thin layer of multinucleated cells depends on the presence of SynT-II. Lastly, the combined mutations of Map2k1 and Map2k2 alter the expression of several genes involved in cell fate specification, cell fusion and cell polarity.

Also semaxinib (10(-5)M) inhibited proliferation of both cell lines. VEGF and endostatin did not influence the growth of H727 and TT cells. The inhibitory effect of IFN\u03b1, rapamycin and semaxinib on carcinoid and medullary thyroid cancer growth was revealed in our in vitro study, although some other antiangiogenic agents did not directly influence H727 and TT cell growth.

{"title": "Memantine enhances recovery from stroke.", "abstract": "Stroke treatment is constrained by limited treatment windows and the clinical inefficacy of agents that showed preclinical promise. Yet animal and clinical data suggest considerable poststroke plasticity, which could allow treatment with recovery-modulating agents. Memantine is a well-tolerated N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist in common use for Alzheimer disease.\nMemantine, 30 mg/kg per day, or vehicle, was delivered chronically in drinking water beginning >2 hours after photothrombotic stroke.\nAlthough there was no difference in infarct size, behavior, or optical intrinsic signal maps in the first 7 days after stroke, mice treated chronically with memantine showed significant improvements in motor control, measured by cylinder test and grid-walking performance, compared with vehicle-treated animals. Optical intrinsic signal revealed an increased area of forepaw sensory maps at 28 days after stroke. There was decreased reactive astrogliosis and increased vascular density around the infarcted cortex. Peri-infarct Western blots revealed increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylated-tropomyosin-related kinase-B receptor expression.\nOur results suggest that memantine improves stroke outcomes in an apparently non-neuroprotective manner involving increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, reduced reactive astrogliosis, and improved vascularization, associated with improved recovery of sensory and motor cortical function.

However, this procedure is the most often litigated in aesthetic surgery because of its frequent complications. Our goal in this article is to report our experience with a four-flap technique for implant coverage in maximum reduction mastopexy with prosthesis.\nFrom January 2011 to March 2013, a total of 41 patients with Regnault grade II or grade III ptosis with no hypertrophy underwent primary bilateral augmentation mastopexy. Our technique includes an inverted-T mastopexy and a thin, well-vascularized, inferior dermoglandular flap to cover the inferior pole of the implant. Retrospective data collection revealed a mean patient age of 37.5 years. Thirty-nine patients were treated with round cohesive silicone gel implants and two with anatomical cohesive gel implants. The mean implant volume was 280 cc and mean follow-up time was 14 months.\nThe following complications were observed in declining frequency: four suture dehiscences, two hematomas, one capsular contracture, one implant malposition, and one poor scarring. A satisfaction questionnaire revealed very high satisfaction in 23 patients (56.09 %), high satisfaction in 12 (29.26 %), moderate satisfaction in four (9.75 %), and low satisfaction in two (4.87 %).\nOur results demonstrated a low complication rate (21.9 %) and low reoperation rate (12.1 %) with our technique and make us confident in recommending this technique for grade II and grade III ptosis.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

We aimed to assess the accuracy of endoluminal confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and laparoscopic fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER), using near-infrared imaging and fluorescence from injected Indocyanine Green, to identify the transition from ischemic to vascular areas in a porcine model of mesenteric ischemia.\nSix pigs underwent 1-h sigmoid segmental ischemia. The ischemic area was evaluated by clinical assessment and FLER to determine presumed viable margins. For each sigmoid colon, 5 regions of interest (ROIs) were identified: ischemic (ROI 1), presumed viable margins ROI 2a (distal) and 2b (proximal), and vascular areas 3a (distal) and 3b (proximal). After injection of fluorescein, CLE scanning of the mucosa from the ischemic area toward viable margins was performed. Capillary blood samples were obtained by puncturing the serosa at the ROIs, and capillary lactates were measured with the EDGE(\u00ae) analyzer.\nCapillary lactates were significantly higher at ROI 1 (4.91 mmol/L) when compared to resection margins (2.8 mmol/L; mean difference: 2.11; p < 0.05) identified by FLER. There was no significant difference in lactates between ROI1 and resection margins identified by clinical evaluation. In 50 % of cases, ROI 2aCLINIC-2bCLINIC were considered to match (<1 cm distance) with ROI 2aFLER-2bFLER.

PAI-1 bound the ternary complex PAI-1-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-uPA receptor (uPAR), thereby exerting antiangiogenic effects. By inhibiting the antifibrinolytic activity of PAI-1, 16K PRL also protected mice against thromboembolism and promoted arterial clot lysis.

Currently available hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilizing agents, were comparatively tested for healing potential in liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-injured mice previously reconstituted with Green Fluorescent Protein BM were mobilized with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), Plerixafor or G-CSF+Plerixafor. Hepatic fibrosis, stellate cell activation and oval stem cell frequency were measured by Gomori and by immunohistochemistry for a-Smooth Muscle Actin and Cytokeratin-19, respectively. Angiogenesis was evaluated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of liver Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis-alpha (TNF\u03b1). BM-derived cells were tracked by double immunofluorescence. The spontaneous migration of mobilized HSCs towards injured liver and its cytokine secretion profile was determined in transwell culture systems. Either single-agent mobilization or the combination of agents significantly ameliorated hepatic damage by decreasing fibrosis and restoring the abnormal vascular network in the liver of mobilized mice compared to CCl4-only mice. The degree of fibrosis reduction was similar among all mobilized mice despite that G-CSF+Plerixafor yielded significantly higher numbers of circulating HSCs over other agents. The liver homing potential of variously mobilized HSCs differed among the agents. An extended G-CSF treatment provided the highest anti-fibrotic effect over all tested modalities, induced by the proliferation of hepatic stem cells and decreased hepatic inflammation. Plerixafor-mobilized HSCs, despite their reduced liver homing potential, reversed fibrosis mainly by increasing hepatic PPAR-\u03b3 and VEGF expression. In all groups, BM-derived mature hepatocytes as well as liver-committed BM stem cells were detected only at low frequencies, further supporting the concept that alternative mechanisms rather than direct HSC effects regulate liver recovery.

Like hypoxia-inducible hyper-vascularization, loss of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a trait common to advanced stages of tumor progression in many metastatic cancers. However, no link between the role of Rb and hypoxia-driven metastatic processes has been established. We demonstrated that Rb is a key mediator of the hypoxic response mediated by HIF1\u03b1/\u03b2, the master regulator of the hypoxia response, and its essential co-activator, the thyroid hormone receptor/retinoblastoma-interacting protein (TRIP230). Furthermore, loss of Rb unmasks the full co-activation potential of TRIP230. Using small inhibitory RNA approaches in vivo, we established that Rb attenuates the normal physiological response to hypoxia by HIF1\u03b1. Notably, loss of Rb results in hypoxia-dependent biochemical changes that promote acquisition of an invasive phenotype in MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition, Rb is present in HIF1\u03b1-ARNT/HIF1\u03b2 transcriptional complexes associated with TRIP230 as determined by co-immuno-precipitation, GST-pull-down and ChIP assays.

Moreover, new bone density (BD) was measured with histomorphometry. Compared with rhBMP-7-delivered NBBM scaffolds, rhVEGF165/rhBMP-7-delivered NBBM scaffolds were with more intense intra-scaffold osteogenesis at the early stage and the ultimate sizeable bone grafts of microstructurally more lamellae and trabeculae, and quantitatively higher BD (31.93% vs. 22.37%, p<0.01).

Three of the four dogs in group 2 rejected their VCA transplants after the cessation of immunosuppression. Biopsies obtained from the muscle and skin of VCA from group 1 showed few infiltrating cells compared with extensive infiltrates in biopsies of VCA from group 2. Compared with autologous skin and muscle, elevated levels of CD3+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells were found in the skin and muscle obtained from the VCA of HCT recipients. All group 1 animals were tolerant to their donor skin graft and promptly rejected the third-party skin grafts.\nThese data demonstrated that donor-specific tolerance to all components of the VCA can be established through simultaneous nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT and VCA transplantation protocol.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2014-06-12", "authors": ["David WMathes", "JeffChang", "BillannaHwang", "Scott SGraves", "Barry EStorer", "TiffanyButts-Miwongtum", "George ESale", "RainerStorb"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0000000000000204"}
{"title": "Esophagus tissue engineering: designing and crafting the components for the \"hybrid construct\" approach.", "abstract": "Although being a tubular structure, the esophagus is an extremely complex organ to engineer. To engineer an organ, its components and their structure and function must be well understood. With regards to esophagus, extensive investigations have been performed in experimental models to understand the nature of the esophageal epithelial cells with regards to their isolation, culture, and growth on scaffolds to generate epithelium. Special subpopulations of these cells have been identified that possess proliferative capabilities with subsequent differentiative capacity to generate epithelium. Studies have also been performed to obtain data on the possibilities of utilizing esophageal biopsies from esophagus damaged after caustic exposure for tissue engineering applications. Subsequently, attention is being paid to the esophageal smooth muscle which is an extremely complex structure responsible for the propulsive activities. In addition to the muscle complex, proper functioning of the esophagus will require understanding of the enteric nervous system (ENS) that controls the propulsive activity in a coordinated manner. Investigations have been performed to better understand the esophageal ENS and to isolate and maintain these cells under tissue culture conditions. Besides the cellular elements, studies have also been performed to seed these cells on scaffolds and study the constructs with regards to cell attachment and viability under tissue culture conditions. Tests have also been performed on native esophageal tissue to understand the functioning of this tissue under the effect of pharmacological agents and to establish norms to compare engineered esophageal tissue. Vascularization, which is a limiting factor in tissue engineering, has been approached with the in situ bioreactor concept using the omentum not only to provide vascular ingrowth but also to offer a pedicle for the engineered esophagus to enable its surgical transposition. This review offers an insight into the advances in esophagus tissue engineering in a large experimental model using the \"hybrid construct\" approach which advocates the precise engineering of the tubular gastrointestinal organs based on growth of specific cells on specially designed scaffolds and amalgamating them to create the desired complex tissue structure.", "journal": "European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

{"title": "Epicutaneous Immunotherapy for Aeroallergen and Food Allergy.", "abstract": "IgE-mediated allergies today affect up to 30\u00a0% of the population in industrialized countries. Allergen immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment option with a long-term effect. However, very few patients (<5\u00a0%) choose immunotherapy, due to the long treatment duration (between 3-5\u00a0years) and possible local and systemic allergic side effects of the allergen administrations. The latter occur when an allergen accidentally reaches the blood circulation. Therefore, the ideal application route for allergen immunotherapy should be characterized by two hallmarks: firstly, by a high number of potent antigen-presenting cells, which enhance efficacy and thus shorten treatment duration. Secondly, the allergen administration site is ideally non-vascularized, so that inadvertent systemic distribution of the allergen and consequent systemic allergic side effects are minimized. The epidermis contains high numbers of potent antigen-presenting Langerhans cells and, as an epithelium, is non-vascularized. Therefore, the epidermis represents an interesting administration route. Historical evidence for the clinical efficacy of epicutaneous allergy immunotherapy (EPIT) has now been strengthened by a number of recent double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials performed by independent groups.

Here we propose a multistep procedure to prepare pre-vascularized three-dimensional (3D) cardiac bio-substitutes using dynamic cell cultures and highly porous biocompatible gelatin scaffolds. The strategy adopted exploits the peculiar differentiation potential of two distinct subsets of adult stem cells to obtain human vascularized 3D cardiac tissues. In the first step of the procedure, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are seeded onto gelatin scaffolds to provide interconnected vessel-like structures, while human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) are stimulated in vitro to obtain their commitment toward the cardiac phenotype. The use of a modular bioreactor allows the perfusion of the whole scaffold, providing superior performance in terms of cardiac tissue maturation and cell survival. Both the cell culture on natural-derived polymers and the continuous medium perfusion of the scaffold led to the formation of a densely packaged proto-tissue composed of vascular-like and cardiac-like cells, which might complete maturation process and interconnect with native tissue upon in vivo implantation. In conclusion, the data obtained through the approach here proposed highlight the importance to provide stem cells with complementary signals in vitro able to resemble the complexity of cardiac microenvironment.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2014-06-12", "authors": ["StefaniaPagliari", "AnnalisaTirella", "ArtiAhluwalia", "SjoerdDuim", "Marie-Jos\u00e8Goumans", "TakaoAoyagi", "GiancarloForte"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2014.00210\n10.1161/01.cir.0000032893.55215.fc\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.11.030\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00687-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.12.022\n10.1093/cvr/cvs260\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0131\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.039\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.08.040\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.10.081\n10.1073/pnas.0812242106\n10.1016/S0091-679X(07)83022-6\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1007/s12015-011-9325-8\n10.1002/stem.763\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.003\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1016/j.scr.2008.02.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.034\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.022\n10.1016/j.cellbi.2008.07.020\n10.1007/s10456-013-9354-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047559\n10.1038/nbt1109\n10.1177/147323000803600106\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.020\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.002\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0085\n10.1002/jcb.22167\n10.1002/term.525\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.07.097\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052176\n10.1002/bit.22671\n10.3727/096368912X653282\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.06.010\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp374\n10.1021/nn4058984\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2004.03.024\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-377\n10.2174/09298673113209990032\n10.1002/adma.201003479\n10.1038/nrm2236\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046842\n10.1038/srep01316\n10.1067/mtc.2001.113600\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01144-X\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.249052\n10.1038/ncomms2406\n10.1038/nrd1226\n10.7150/thno.3682\n10.1002/jbm.a.34010\n10.1093/cvr/cvp146\n10.1038/nprot.2008.229\n10.4161/biom.19835\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208991\n10.1007/s10456-009-9147-3\n10.1038/nm1182\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020914\n10.1002/bit.23164\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.10.060\n10.1177/0883911511423563\n10.1038/srep04706\n10.1038/nm1394"}

Injection into the FA resulted in staining of the skin and soft tissues in the medial canthal region and superior eyelid skin in 66% of specimens. CT scan studies confirm our findings with injection into the STA resulting in contrast infiltration of the palpebral arterial arcades in all cases. Injection of the FA resulted in contrast infiltration of the palpebral arterial arcades in 2 of 3 cases.\nBased this study, a periorbital flap can be based on the STA.

Bi-layer silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrices were investigated for their ability to support bladder tissue regeneration and function in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Bladder augmentation was performed with each scaffold configuration in SCI animals for 10\u00a0wk of implantation and compared to non-augmented control groups (normal and SCI alone). Animals subjected to SCI alone exhibited a 72% survival rate (13/18) while SCI rats receiving SIS and bi-layer SF scaffolds displayed respective survival rates of 83% (10/12) and 75% (9/12) over the course of the study period.

{"title": "Recapitulating endochondral ossification: a promising route to in vivo bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Despite its natural healing potential, bone is unable to regenerate sufficient tissue within critical-sized defects, resulting in a non-union of bone ends. As a consequence, interventions are required to replace missing, damaged or diseased bone. Bone grafts have been widely employed for the repair of such critical-sized defects. However, the well-documented drawbacks associated with autografts, allografts and xenografts have motivated the development of alternative treatment options. Traditional tissue engineering strategies have typically attempted to direct in vitro bone-like matrix formation within scaffolds prior to implantation into bone defects, mimicking the embryological process of intramembranous ossification (IMO). Tissue-engineered constructs developed using this approach often fail once implanted, due to poor perfusion, leading to avascular necrosis and core degradation. As a result of such drawbacks, an alternative tissue engineering strategy, based on endochondral ossification (ECO), has begun to emerge, involving the use of in vitro tissue-engineered cartilage as a transient biomimetic template to facilitate bone formation within large defects. This is driven by the hypothesis that hypertrophic chondrocytes can secrete angiogenic and osteogenic factors, which play pivotal roles in both the vascularization of constructs in vivo and the deposition of a mineralized extracellular matrix, with resulting bone deposition. In this context, this review focuses on current strategies taken to recapitulate ECO, using a range of distinct cells, biomaterials and biochemical stimuli, in order to facilitate in vivo bone formation.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2014-06-12", "authors": ["Emmet MThompson", "AmosMatsiko", "EricFarrell", "Daniel JKelly", "Fergal JO'Brien"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1918"}

Furthermore, the vascular systems of the pig gallbladder were analyzed in terms of the adaptation of this organ to changes in its volume during cyclical bile storage and discharge. The gallbladder is supplied by the cystic artery, which in the pig represents a mixed pinnate and bipinnate pattern of branching. The light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic observations of three-dimensional vascular corrosion casts showed the presence of two main complex vascular networks in the wall of the gallbladder, one located in the subserosal and the other in the mucosa. The unique features in the pig, connected with the size of the gallbladder, is the well-developed horizontal venous plexus under folds of the mucosa, which is a voluminous reservoir of fluids absorbed from bile and vascular networks around mucous glands. Superficial blood vessels of the gallbladder run in vascular pairs or triads, where a single artery runs between two veins. The structures of blood flow control, that is, venous valves, were observed only in venules of the subserosal plexus. Spatial arrangement of the vascular network in the pig gallbladder shows functional plasticity during changes in gallbladder volume. The course of superficial blood vessels in the well-filled gallbladder is arcuate, while in the empty gallbladder it is undulated or spiral.

Adipose tissue specimens were analyzed for angiogenic and adipocytic markers and for content of the antiangiogenic peptides endostatin and angiostatin. Cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with adipose tissue homogenate to examine its effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion. MMP12 content and activity were increased in the adipose tissue of wild-type mice at 2 weeks of age, leading to elevated endostatin production, inhibition of VEGF secretion, and decreased adipose tissue vascularity. By 8 weeks of age, adipose MMP12 levels subsided, and the protein was no longer detectable. However, chronic CS exposure led to macrophage accumulation and restored adipose MMP12 activity, thereby suppressing adipose tissue mass and vascularity. Our results reveal a novel systemic role for MMP12 in postnatal adipose tissue expansion and smoking-associated weight loss by suppressing vascularity within the white adipose tissue depots.", "journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "date": "2014-06-11", "authors": ["TakaoTsuji", "Neil JKelly", "SaekoTakahashi", "Adriana SLeme", "A McGarryHoughton", "Steven DShapiro"], "doi": "10.1165/rcmb.2014-0083OC"}

Although the most frequent malignancy arising within a CMN is melanoma, the association between rhabdomyosarcoma and CMN has rarely been documented. We present a case arising in a 4-month-old girl with a giant CMN. She presented for evaluation of a pedunculated lesion at the superior gluteal crease that had been present since birth and exhibited rapid growth. Biopsy of the lesion revealed two distinct components: an expansile proliferation of pleomorphic cells with varying degrees of cellularity and a proliferation of banal-appearing melanocytic nevic cells. The cells of the expansile proliferation displayed a wide range of morphologic features, including nests of round cells, spindle-shaped cells, and more differentiated rhabdomyoblasts within a myxoid, highly vascularized stroma. Cross-striations, a marker of skeletal muscle differentiation, were present. These tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive with desmin, myo-D1, and myogenin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with PAX3/7-FKHR probes was negative. A diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in association with CMN was made. Initial excision revealed tumor at the margins, and the patient underwent reexcision with subsequent chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide. She was disease-free at the 6-year follow-up. It has been postulated that the combination of melanocytic and rhabdomyoblastic cells within the same lesion may imply derivation from a common pluripotent stem cell or neural crest cell. Clinicians following patients with giant CMN should consider rhabdomyosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of lesions arising within the nevus.", "journal": "Pediatric dermatology", "date": "2014-06-11", "authors": ["Mitalee PChristman", "Jennifer KKerner", "CarolCheng", "AdrianoPiris", "Anne GNepo", "AlirezaSepehr", "DanielaKroshinsky"], "doi": "10.1111/pde.12359"}

The inferiorly based flap was then placed into the airway through the cricothyroid membrane. The extent of coverage was measured.\nA total of 10 flaps were performed (6 male and 4 female). The average length of thyroid perichondrial flaps obtained was 1.67 cm. All flaps were able to completely cover the cricoid cartilage and extended to but did not cover the first tracheal ring. Once placed intraluminally, the flaps extended 2.4 cm below the vocal cords. Using both flaps enabled coverage of the entire anterior 180 degrees of the airway lumen in all specimens. There were no significant differences in male/female or right-sided/left-sided flaps.\nThe thyroid ala perichondrial flap is technically feasible and can provide coverage of anterior airway defects up to approximately 2.4 cm below the true vocal cords.

When analyzed for blood cell lysis using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as an indicator, no significant differences were observed between blood exposed to our HFMs and uncoagulated blood. Analysis of protein adsorption showed a low concentration of proteins deposited on the surfaces of HFM after 24\u2009h. Platelet adhesion profiles using human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) showed that a low level of platelets adhered to the HFMs after 24\u2009h, indicating minimal thrombotic potential.

{"title": "Yolk-sac-derived macrophages regulate fetal testis vascularization and morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Organogenesis of the testis is initiated when expression of Sry in pre-Sertoli cells directs the gonad toward a male-specific fate. The cells in the early bipotential gonad undergo de novo organization to form testis cords that enclose germ cells inside tubules lined by epithelial Sertoli cells. Although Sertoli cells are a driving force in the de novo formation of testis cords, recent studies in mouse showed that reorganization of the vasculature and of interstitial cells also play critical roles in testis cord morphogenesis. However, the mechanism driving reorganization of the vasculature during fetal organogenesis remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that fetal macrophages are associated with nascent gonadal and mesonephric vasculature during the initial phases of testis morphogenesis. Macrophages mediate vascular reorganization and prune errant germ cells and somatic cells after testis architecture is established. We show that gonadal macrophages are derived from primitive yolk-sac hematopoietic progenitors and exhibit hallmarks of M2 activation status, suggestive of angiogenic and tissue remodeling functions. Depletion of macrophages resulted in impaired vascular reorganization and abnormal cord formation.

Despite the vast majority of them are of benign origin, the incidence of thyroid cancer is currently rather rising. Although there are several risk factors of thyroid cancer and several clinical, ultrasound, biochemical and molecular diagnostic markers, the exact mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis and the linkage between thyroid nodule ultrasound appearance and its biological character remain unclear. While ionizing radiation is the only one well-known risk factor for thyroid cancer, the significance of some others remains unclear. The aim of our review was to discuss some not completely known pathophysiological mechanisms involved in thyroid oncogenesis as hypothyroidism, mutations of genes regulating cell proliferation, thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy and to describe pathophysiological background of some ultrasound markers of thyroid cancer (size, echogenicity, vascularization, calcifications and stiffness). Better knowledge in this field is crucial for development of novel diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches. For example, the analysis of BRAF, RAS and other mutations in cytological samples may help to distinction between follicular thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid adenoma and may significantly decrease the number of unnecessary surgery among patients with thyroid nodules. Alternatively, the different malign cells growth, angiogenesis, destructions of thyroid follicles, reparative changes, growth retardation, fibrosis and increased interstitial fluid pressure implicate the typical ultrasound appearance of papillary thyroid cancer (hypoechogenicity, irregular vascularization, microcalcifications, stiffness) which is essential to catch the suspicious nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance among large amount of benign nodules.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2014-06-09", "authors": ["JKr\u00e1tk\u00fd", "HV\u00edtkov\u00e1", "JBart\u00e1kov\u00e1", "ZTeli\u010dka", "MAnto\u0161ov\u00e1", "ZL\u00edmanov\u00e1", "JJiskra"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.932818"}

We were able to control the aggregation pattern of ECs in 3D collagen hydrogels, by varying the matrix composition and/or having a source of cells signalling angiogenic proteins. These aggregation patterns reflect the different developmental pathways that ECs take to form different sized tubular structures. Cultures with added laminin and thus increased expression of \u03b16 integrin showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in VEGFR2 positive ECs and increased VEGF uptake. This resulted in the end-to-end network aggregation of ECs. In cultures without laminin and therefore low \u03b16 integrin expression, VEGFR2 levels and VEGF uptake were significantly lower (p<0.05). These ECs formed contiguous sheets, analogous to the 'wrapping' pathway in development.

Human mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (hAMSCs) expressing two luciferase genes, one under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the other under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (osteocalcin or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule), were seeded in fibrin matrices containing BMP-2 and fibrin-binding PDGF-BB, and further implanted intramuscularly or in a mouse calvarial defect.

The peripheral nerve especially peptidergic nerve has effect on the bone regeneration. The peptidergic nerve can be used to construct the neurotized tissue engineered bone by implanting the nerve fiber into the center of bone graft. Thus, constructing a highly vascularized and neurotized tissue engineered bone according with the theory of biomimetics has become a useful method for repairing the large bone defect. Many researchers have used the microsurgical techniques to enhance the vascularization and neurotization of tissue engineered bone and to get a better osteogenesis effect. This review aims to summarize the microsurgical techniques mostly used to construct the vascularized and neurotized tissue engineered bone.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2014-06-06", "authors": ["JunjunFan", "LongBi", "DanJin", "KuanhaiWei", "BinChen", "ZhiyongZhang", "GuoxianPei"], "doi": "10.1155/2014/281872"}
{"title": "The pulmonary localization of virus-specific T lymphocytes is governed by the tissue tropism of infection.", "abstract": "The migration of pathogen-specific T cells into nonlymphoid tissues, such as the lung, is critical to control peripheral infections. Use of in vivo intravascular labeling of leukocytes has allowed for improved discrimination between cells located in the blood from cells present within peripheral tissues, such as the lung. This is particularly important in the lung, which is comprised of an intricate network of blood vessels that harbors a large proportion of the total blood volume at any given time. Recent work has demonstrated that >80% of antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells remain in the pulmonary vasculature following an intratracheal infection with a systemic viral pathogen. However, it remains unclear what proportion of effector CD8 T cells are located within lung tissue following a localized respiratory viral infection. We confirm that most effector and memory CD8 T cells are found in the vasculature after an intranasal infection with the systemic pathogens lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vaccinia virus (VACV). In contrast, following pulmonary viral infections with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza A virus (IAV), 80 to 90% of the antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells were located within lung tissue. Similarly, the majority of antigen-specific CD4 T cells were present within lung tissue during a pulmonary viral infection. Furthermore, a greater proportion of gamma interferon-positive (IFN-\u03b3(+)) effector CD8 and CD4 T cells were located within lung tissue following a localized respiratory viral infection. Our results indicate that T cells exhibit significantly altered distribution patterns dependent upon the tissue tropism of the infection.\nThe migration of T cells to nonlymphoid sites, such as the lung, is critical to mediate clearance of viral infections. The highly vascularized lung holds up to 40% of blood, and thus, the T cell response may be a reflection of lymphocytes localized to the pulmonary vasculature instead of lung tissue. We examined the localization of T cell responses within the lung following either a localized or systemic viral infection. We demonstrate that following intranasal infection with a systemic pathogen, most T cells are localized to the pulmonary vasculature. In contrast, T cells are primarily localized to lung tissue following a respiratory viral infection. Our results demonstrate vast differences in the localization of T cell responses within the lung parenchyma between pathogens that can replicate locally versus systemically and that intravascular antibody labeling can be utilized to assess the localization patterns of T cell responses in nonlymphoid organs.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2014-06-06", "authors": ["Cory JKnudson", "Kayla AWeiss", "Stacey MHartwig", "Steven MVarga"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.00329-14\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00097.x\n10.1146/annurev.ph.57.030195.000525\n10.4049/jimmunol.1102243\n10.4049/jimmunol.1201682\n10.1172/JCI24482\n10.1038/nature06672\n10.4049/jimmunol.1100764\n10.4049/jimmunol.179.8.5415\n10.1002/0471729256.mc15g01s3\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1003054\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902874\n10.1128/JVI.02021-06\n10.1128/JVI.02493-10\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08516.x\n10.1038/ni.1718\n10.4049/jimmunol.1102104\n10.1038/mi.2013.67\n10.1099/0022-1317-66-12-2533\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80573-7\n10.1189/jlb.0313180\n10.1073/pnas.101132698\n10.4049/jimmunol.166.3.1813\n10.1038/ni.2525\n10.1084/jem.193.8.981\n10.1016/S1074-7613(04)00021-4\n10.1172/JCI63287\n10.1073/pnas.1010201107\n10.1084/jem.20090858\n10.1073/pnas.1202288109"}

{"title": "Autophagy and apoptosis: parent-of-origin genome-dependent mechanisms of cellular self-destruction.", "abstract": "Functional genomic imprinting is necessary for the transfer of maternal resources to mammalian embryos. Imprint-free embryos are unable to establish a viable placental vascular network necessary for the transfer of resources such as nutrients and oxygen. How the parental origin of inherited genes influences cellular response to resource limitation is currently not well understood. Because such limitations are initially realized by the placenta, we studied how maternal and paternal genomes influence the cellular self-destruction responses of this organ specifically. Here, we show that cellular autophagy is prevalent in androgenetic (i.e. having only a paternal genome) placentae, while apoptosis is prevalent in parthenogenetic (i.e. having only a maternal genome) placentae. Our findings indicate that the parental origin of inherited genes determines the placenta's cellular death pathway: autophagy for androgenotes and apoptosis for parthenogenotes. The difference in time of arrest between androgenotes and parthenogenotes can be attributed, at least in part, to their placentae's selective use of these two cell death pathways. We anticipate our findings to be a starting point for general studies on the parent-of-origin regulation of autophagy.

We have taken the challenging approach of combining angioplasty and free tissue transfer for limb salvage.\nBetween October 2011 and December 2013, 11 patients (average age of 56.8 years; ranged from 43-72 years old) with peripheral arterial occlusive disease of main tibioperoneal arteries underwent preoperative angioplasty. Afterward, free tissue transfers (nine anterolateral thigh free flaps, one vastus lateralis muscle free flap, and one deep femoral artery perforator flap) were performed on these patients for lower extremity salvage and reconstruction.\nAll 11 free tissue transfers after angioplasty were successful without operative mortality or major complications. Minimal wound dehiscence was seen in one case, and partial flap necrosis was seen in the other cases. During the follow-up period, all of the patients had their wounds healed completely and achieved acceptable contour and quality of gait.\nThe preoperative angioplasty provides well-vascularized tissue that both controls infection and helps free flaps to survive. Therefore, the patients due to receive leg amputation in spite of the free tissue transfer can achieve limb salvage by using the additional technique of angioplasty.

Currently, biological grafts are used to assist in repairing these complex hernias. Dermis grafts are often chosen because of their mechanical characteristics; however, dermis does not have the ability to promote the muscle regeneration needed to regain abdominal wall function. In contrast, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) grafts have been shown to promote muscle generation in volumetric muscle loss (VML) models. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the extent to which SIS grafts can be used together with dermis grafts to repair and promote muscle regeneration in a full-thickness abdominal wall defect in a rat model. The dermis layer is intended to mechanically bridge the defect and support constructive tissue remodeling while the SIS is intended to degrade and promote neo-muscle formation. After 16 weeks of implantation, we found only a small amount of vascularized muscle (<10% of the defect area) in the repaired defects. No significant difference in defect muscle area was found between the groups receiving the dermis\u2009+\u2009SIS scaffolds and the control (dermis alone) group. Our findings indicate that the SIS constructions investigated could not promote appreciable muscle regeneration in this rigorous animal model of VML and incomplete abdominal closure.

{"title": "Cryopreservation and replantation of amputated rat hind limbs.", "abstract": "In spite of the relatively high success rate of limb replantation, many patients cannot undergo replantation surgery because the preservation time of an amputated limb is only about six hours. In addition, although allotransplantation of composite tissues is being performed more commonly with increasingly greater success rates, the shortage of donors limits the number of patients that can be treated. So the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of cryopreservation and replantation of limbs in a rat model.\nTwelve five-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided evenly into group A (above-knee amputation) and group B (Syme's amputation). One hind limb was amputated from each rat. The limbs were irrigated with cryoprotectant, cooled in a controlled manner to -140\u00b0C, and placed in liquid nitrogen.

{"title": "DUSP3/VHR is a pro-angiogenic atypical dual-specificity phosphatase.", "abstract": "DUSP3 phosphatase, also known as Vaccinia-H1 Related (VHR) phosphatase, encoded by DUSP3/Dusp3 gene, is a relatively small member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases. In vitro studies showed that DUSP3 is a negative regulator of ERK and JNK pathways in several cell lines. On the other hand, DUSP3 is implicated in human cancer. It has been alternatively described as having tumor suppressive and oncogenic properties. Thus, the available data suggest that DUSP3 plays complex and contradictory roles in tumorigenesis that could be cell type-dependent. Since most of these studies were performed using recombinant proteins or in cell-transfection based assays, the physiological function of DUSP3 has remained elusive.\nUsing immunohistochemistry on human cervical sections, we observed a strong expression of DUSP3 in endothelial cells (EC) suggesting a contribution for this phosphatase to EC functions. DUSP3 downregulation, using RNA interference, in human EC reduced significantly in vitro tube formation on Matrigel and spheroid angiogenic sprouting. However, this defect was not associated with an altered phosphorylation of the documented in vitro DUSP3 substrates, ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and EGFR but was associated with an increased PKC phosphorylation. To investigate the physiological function of DUSP3, we generated Dusp3-deficient mice by homologous recombination. The obtained DUSP3-/- mice were healthy, fertile, with no spontaneous phenotype and no vascular defect. However, DUSP3 deficiency prevented neo-vascularization of transplanted b-FGF containing Matrigel and LLC xenograft tumors as evidenced by hemoglobin (Hb) and FITC-dextran quantifications. Furthermore, we found that DUSP3 is required for b-FGF-induced microvessel outgrowth in the aortic ring assay.\nAll together, our data identify DUSP3 as a new important player in angiogenesis.", "journal": "Molecular cancer", "date": "2014-06-03", "authors": ["MathieuAmand", "CharlotteErpicum", "KhalidBajou", "FabioCerignoli", "SilviaBlacher", "MaudMartin", "FranckDequiedt", "PierreDrion", "PratibhaSingh", "TinatinZurashvili", "MaudVandereyken", "LuciaMusumeci", "TomasMustelin", "MichelMoutschen", "ChristineGilles", "AgnesNoel", "SouadRahmouni"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-4598-13-108\n10.1007/978-1-62703-562-0_13\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210421\n10.1038/cr.2008.37\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.12.009\n10.2174/187152011794941190\n10.1073/pnas.89.24.12170\n10.1126/science.272.5266.1328\n10.1074/jbc.M006497200\n10.1074/jbc.M110.163295\n10.1038/ncb1398\n10.4161/cc.5.19.3267\n10.1186/1471-2407-8-147\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1224\n10.1172/JCI68642\n10.1002/ijc.22597\n10.1021/jm901016k\n10.1038/ni856\n10.1038/nrc2780\n10.1038/onc.2010.49\n10.1096/fj.06-5885fje\n10.1096/fj.12-213686\n10.4049/jimmunol.0901511\n10.1023/A:1012251229631\n10.1073/pnas.251686198\n10.4049/jimmunol.1300989\n10.1093/hmg/11.11.1251\n10.1016/j.lfs.2011.11.017\n10.1038/onc.2010.449\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-128\n10.1074/jbc.270.48.28495\n10.1016/S0960-9822(95)00191-6\n10.1016/S0960-9822(95)00277-6\n10.1074/jbc.272.29.18382\n10.1074/jbc.272.6.3544\n10.1517/14728222.2011.648617\n10.1038/ni1310\n10.1038/nature02764\n10.1251/bpo30\n10.1182/blood-2011-12-400267\n10.1128/MCB.25.6.2227-2241.2005"}

Pre-clinical animal models that closely mimic human MI are pivotal for a quick translation of research and swine have similarities in anatomy and physiology. Here, we compared coronary surgical ligation versus coil embolization MI models in swine.\nFifteen animals were randomly distributed to undergo surgical ligation (n=7) or coil embolization (n=8). We evaluated infarct size, scar fibrosis, inflammation, myocardial vascularization, and cardiac function by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThirty-five days after MI, there were no differences between the models in infarct size (P=0.53), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (P=0.19), LV end systolic volume (P=0.22), LV end diastolic volume (P=0.84), and cardiac output (P=0.89). Histologically, cardiac scars did not differ and the collagen content, collagen type I (I), collagen type III (III), and the I/III ratio were similar in both groups. Inflammation was assessed using specific anti-CD3 and anti-CD25 antibodies.

{"title": "Soluble Flt1 and placental growth factor are novel determinants of newborn thyroid (dys)function: the generation R study.", "abstract": "Adequate thyroid hormone availability during fetal and early life is crucial for normal child growth and development. Fetal growth heavily depends on angiogenesis. Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a proangiogenic factor sharing high homology with vascular endothelial growth factor, whereas soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1) is a potent antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor and PlGF signaling. Because the thyroid is a highly vascularized organ, we hypothesized that fetal angiogenic factors influence in utero thyrogenesis and impair newborn thyroid function. Therefore, we investigated the association between sFlt1 and PlGF on newborn thyroid function.\nsFlt1, PlGF, TSH, and free T4 (FT4) were determined in cord serum of 3525 newborns from a large prospective cohort study. Analyses were adjusted for relevant maternal and child covariates.\nsFlt1 levels were positively associated with TSH (\u03b2 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 mU/L; P < .001) and inversely with FT4 (\u03b2 -0.58 \u00b1 0.11; P < .001). PlGF showed a positive association with FT4 (\u03b2 0.19 \u00b1 0.02; P < .001). Elevated levels of sFlt1 were associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk of hypothyroxinemia (P = .04). Decreased levels of PlGF were associated with a 6.7-fold increased risk of hypothyroxinemia (P < .001). Within the normal range, a dose-dependent effect of sFlt1 on thyroid dysfunction was observed: high-normal sFlt1 levels were associated with a 17.7-fold increased risk of hypothyroxinemia (P < .001) and a 2.7-fold increased risk of hyperthyrotropinemia (P = .01).\nFetal angiogenic factors sFlt1 and PlGF are associated with newborn thyroid function. Possible effects are most likely mediated through effects on in utero thyrogenesis. Abnormal as well as normal-range fetal sFlt1 and PlGF levels influence the risk of impaired newborn thyroid function, which has been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects.

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether pre-existing vascular changes can be used to predict tumor transformation as benign or malignant. We sought to characterize microvascular changes and tumor development in the intestinal tract of ApcMin/+ mice and ApcMin/+/Vash2-/- mice.\nApcMin/+ mice provide a unique orthotopic model for the development of spontaneous adenomatous polyposis and subsequent carcinomas, a phenomenon termed the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. ApcMin/+ mice were mated with Vash2-/- mice with a mixed C57BL/6 background and the resulting pups were screened for the Min mutation and for the Vash2-/- gene by PCR. Intestinal tumors from ApcMin/+ mice and ApcMin/+/Vash2-/- mice were removed and either frozen or epon-embedded for subsequent analyses. For 3-dimensional imaging using confocal laser-scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, cryosections were made, and immunofluorescent staining for various markers was performed.\nWe found that structural abnormalities in tumor vessels from benign tumors resembled those in malignant tumors. In addition, a novel angiogenic factor, vasohibin-2 (VASH2) protein, was detected around tumor blood vessels in late-stage adenomas and adenocarcinomas, but was absent from early-stage adenomas in ApcMin/+ mice. Tumors used to examine endogenous VASH2 (derived from CMT93 colon carcinomas) were less vascularized in Vash2-/- mice and were more regular than those seen in wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, tumors in Vash2-/- mice were smaller than those in WT mice. Furthermore, cross-breeding of mice homozygous for a deletion of Vash2 with mice heterozygous for the APC mutation resulted in animals that showed a significant decrease in the number of polyps in the small intestine.\nWe propose that VASH2 may modulate the onset of tumors in the gastrointestinal tract by regulating tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Molecular cancer", "date": "2014-06-03", "authors": ["ShujiKitahara", "YasuhiroSuzuki", "MasaeMorishima", "AsukaYoshii", "SachikoKikuta", "KazuhikoShimizu", "ShunichiMorikawa", "YasufumiSato", "TaichiEzaki"], "doi": "10.1186/1476-4598-13-99\n10.1152/physrev.00038.2010\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62965-3\n10.1007/s10555-007-9094-7\n10.1007/s00795-009-0481-8\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64920-6\n10.1038/nm0603-685\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65006-7\n10.1038/nrc1094\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63540-7\n10.4161/cc.20374\n10.3109/03009734.2012.660550\n10.1093/jb/mvs128\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090829\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.080788\n10.1182/blood-2008-07-170316\n10.1016/j.vph.2012.01.002\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0098-T\n10.1054/bjoc.2001.1809\n10.1002/ijc.21282\n10.1126/science.2296722\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4208\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00348.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009070\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9\n10.1038/339058a0\n10.1016/j.ejca.2009.04.007\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604733\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.11.006\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1038/nrc704\n10.1126/science.1104819\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81333-1\n10.1053/gast.2001.29609\n10.1093/carcin/21.4.757\n10.1002/path.1711240108\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64676-7\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199604)178:4<363::AID-PATH491>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1007/s00428-006-0195-4\n10.1016/j.mvr.2009.06.010"}

Metastasis models can reveal insights in tumor development and progression and provide tools to test new intervention strategies.\nTo develop a new cancer metastasis model, we used DU145 human prostate cancer cells and performed repeated rounds of orthotopic prostate injection and selection of subsequent lymph node metastases. Tumor growth, metastasis, cell migration and invasion were analyzed. Microarray analysis was used to identify cell migration- and cancer-related genes correlating with metastasis. Selected genes were silenced using siRNA, and their roles in cell migration and invasion were determined in transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays.\nOur in vivo cycling strategy created cell lines with dramatically increased tumorigenesis and increased ability to colonize lymph nodes (DU145LN1-LN4). Prostate tumor xenografts displayed increased vascularization, enlarged podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels and invasive margins. Microarray analysis revealed gene expression profiles that correlated with metastatic potential. Using gene network analysis we selected 3 significantly upregulated cell movement and cancer related genes for further analysis: EPCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), ITGB4 (integrin \u03b24) and PLAU (urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)). These genes all showed increased protein expression in the more metastatic DU145-LN4 cells compared to the parental DU145. SiRNA knockdown of EpCAM, integrin-\u03b24 or uPA all significantly reduced cell migration in DU145-LN4 cells. In contrast, only uPA siRNA inhibited cell invasion into Matrigel.

{"title": "Complete Achilles tendon rupture after local infiltration of corticosteroids in the treatment of deep retrocalcaneal bursitis.", "abstract": "Complete rupture of the Achilles tendon is relatively rare, but it is an injury of considerable clinical relevance. A common cause of non-traumatic tendon rupture is local corticosteroid infiltration. Corticosteroid injections may start a degenerative process resulting in partial rupture and subsequent complete rupture of the tendon due to a direct toxic effect, because corticosteroids inhibit production of extracellular matrix collagen and also because of poor local vascularization. This paper describes the case of a patient who presented with complete rupture of the Achilles tendon shortly after administration of local corticosteroid injections in the treatment of deep retrocalcaneal bursitis. This confirms that corticosteroid treatment which is not correctly and accurately administered may be a factor contributing to major injury. It demonstrates that the physician must take all necessary precautions when administering corticosteroid infiltration. It is particularly important that corticosteroid injection is performed under ultrasound guidance which permits visualization of the needle tip and therefore exact identification of the injection site.\nLe rotture complete del tendine d\u2019Achille sono piuttosto rare, ma hanno una notevole rilevanza clinica.

This micronutrient deficiency impacts collagen formation and results in damage to a variety of bodily tissues. While clinical manifestations are observed routinely, the lack of specific signatures on bone makes paleopathological diagnosis difficult. Rapid growth in infants, children, and subadults provides abundant remodeled tissue and an increase in vascularization that makes identification possible in younger segments of the population. However, diagnosis of scurvy in adults remains problematic, given that diagnostic lesions are strikingly similar to those associated with rickets, osteomalacia, and other conditions. We argue that this confounding factor underscores the need for a broader anthropological approach to scurvy research that expands beyond differential diagnosis to include more accurate reconstruction of diets and available resources, greater consideration of the possibility - even likelihood - of multiple nutrient deficiencies simultaneously affecting an individual, and the patterning of these deficiencies along lines of status, sex, and age.", "journal": "International journal of paleopathology", "date": "2014-06-01", "authors": ["George JArmelagos", "KendraSirak", "TaylorWerkema", "Bethany LTurner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.09.007"}

{"title": "Impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia pharmacological treatment on transrectal prostate biopsy adverse effects.", "abstract": "Background. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) pharmacological treatment may promote a decrease in prostate vascularization and bladder neck relaxation with theoretical improvement in prostate biopsy morbidity, though never explored in the literature. Methods. Among 242 consecutive unselected patients who underwent prostate biopsy, after excluding those with history of prostate biopsy/surgery or using medications not for BPH, we studied 190 patients. On the 15th day after procedure patients were questioned about symptoms lasting over a week and classified according to pharmacological BPH treatment. Results. Thirty-three patients (17%) were using alpha-blocker exclusively, five (3%) 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor exclusively, twelve (6%) patients used both medications, and 140 (74%) patients used none. There was no difference in regard to age among groups (P = 0.5). Postbiopsy adverse effects occurred as follows: hematuria 96 (50%), hematospermia 53 (28%), hematochezia 22 (12%), urethrorrhagia 19 (10%), fever 5 (3%), and pain 20 (10%). There was a significant negative correlation between postbiopsy hematuria and BPH pharmacological treatment with stronger correlation for combined use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor and alpha-blocker over 6 months (P = 0.0027).

{"title": "Cotton-wool-like bioactive glasses for bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Inorganic sol-gel solutions were electrospun to produce the first bioactive three-dimensional (3-D) scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration with a structure like cotton-wool (or cotton candy). This flexible 3-D fibrous structure is ideal for packing into complex defects. It also has large inter-fiber spaces to promote vascularization, penetration of cells and transport of nutrients throughout the scaffold. The 3-D fibrous structure was obtained by electrospinning, where the applied electric field and the instabilities exert tremendous force on the spinning jet, which is required to be viscoelastic to prevent jet break up. Previously, polymer binding agents were used with inorganic solutions to produce electrospun composite two-dimensional fibermats, requiring calcination to remove the polymer. This study presents novel reaction and processing conditions for producing a viscoelastic inorganic sol-gel solution that results in fibers by the entanglement of the intermolecularly overlapped nanosilica species in the solution, eliminating the need for a binder. Three-dimensional cotton-wool-like structures were only produced when solutions containing calcium nitrate were used, suggesting that the charge of the Ca(2+) ions had a significant effect. The resulting bioactive silica fibers had a narrow diameter range of 0.5-2\u03bcm and were nanoporous.

Healthy volunteers with a history of heavy but cyclic and regular menstrual cycles were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonographic examination was performed before and after six months of LNG-IUS placement: uterine volume, endometrial thickness, and subendometrial and myometrial Doppler blood flow patterns have been evaluated.\nA total of 32 women were enrolled out of 186 initially screened. At six months of follow-up, all subjects showed a reduction in menstrual blood loss; for analysis, they were retrospectively divided into 3 groups: normal cycling women (Group I), amenorrheic women (Group II), and women with prolonged bleedings (Group III). Intergroup analysis documented a statistically significant difference in endometrial thickness among the three groups; in addition, mean pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) in the spiral arteries were significantly lower in Group I and Group III compared to Group II. This difference persisted also when comparing--within subjects of Group III--mean PI and RI mean values before and after insertion.\nThe LNG-IUS not only altered endometrial thickness, but--in women with prolonged bleedings--also significantly changed uterine artery blood flow.

One solution for this problem is to implant scaffolds that contain functional genes that promote vascularization by providing angiogenic growth factors via a gene delivery carrier. Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) is a gene delivery carrier with high transfection efficiency but with cytotoxicity. To solve this problem, we utilized Antheraea pernyi silk fibroin (ASF), which has favorable cytocompatibility and biodegradability, RGD sequences and a negative charge, in conjunction with PEI, as the delivery vector for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165-angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) dual gene simultaneous expression plasmid, creating an ASF/PEI/pDNA complex. The results suggested that the zeta potential of the ASF/PEI/pDNA complex was significantly lower than that of the PEI/pDNA complex. Decreased nitrogen and increased oxygen on the surface of the complex demonstrated that the ASF had successfully combined with the surface of the PEI/pDNA. Furthermore, the complexes resisted digestion by nucleic acid enzymes and degradation by serum. L929 cells were cultured and transfected in vitro and improved cytotoxicity was found when the cells were transfected with ASF/PEI/pDNA compared with PEI/pDNA. In addition, the transfection efficiency and VEGF secretion increased.

Here we determine the key transcriptional events in subcutaneous WAT of mice in response to mitoNEET overexpression and a high-fat diet (HFD). Microarray analyses at key points during weight gain upon body weight divergence with wild-type mice demonstrate that mitoNEET-enriched sWAT early on, upregulates a browning signature programme that limits WAT expansion in transgenic mice for a period of up to 12 weeks of HFD. This compensatory browning phenotype is subsequently lost, resulting in rapid WAT expansion and body weight gain. Exposure to thermoneutral temperatures during HFD prompts weight gain significantly earlier. Similar WAT expansion is achieved upon infection with an adeno-associated virus expressing mitoNEET.

We investigated this with a novel VCA combined flap model incorporating full-thickness hemiabdominal wall and hindlimb osteomyocutaneous (HAW/HLOMC) flaps. Effects of allograft mass (AM) and VBMT on VCA outcome were studied by comparing HAW/HLOMC VCAs with fully MHC-mismatched BN donors and Lewis recipients. Control groups did not receive treatments following transplantation. Treatment groups received a short course of cyclosporine A (CsA), antilymphocyte serum, and three doses of adipocyte-derived stem cells (POD 1, 8, and 15). The results showed that all flaps in control allogeneic groups rejected soon after VCAs. Treatment significantly prolonged allograft survival. Three of eight recipients in HLOMC treatment group had allografts survive long-term and developed donor-specific tolerance. Significantly higher peripheral chimerism was observed in HLOMC than other groups. It is concluded that the relative amount of AM to VBMT is a critical factor influencing long-term allograft survival.

This study is to engineer a vascularized bone graft by integrating a vascularized biomimetic cell-sheet-engineered periosteum (CSEP) and a biodegradable macroporous beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) scaffold. We first cultured human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to form cell sheet and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were then seeded on the undifferentiated hMSCs sheet to form vascularized cell sheet for mimicking the fibrous layer of native periosteum. A mineralized hMSCs sheet was cultured to mimic the cambium layer of native periosteum. This mineralized hMSCs sheet was first wrapped onto a cylindrical \u03b2-TCP scaffold followed by wrapping the vascularized HUVEC/hMSC sheet, thus generating a biomimetic CSEP on the \u03b2-TCP scaffold. A nonperiosteum structural cell sheets-covered \u03b2-TCP and plain \u03b2-TCP were used as controls. In vitro studies indicate that the undifferentiated hMSCs sheet facilitated HUVECs to form rich capillary-like networks. In vivo studies indicate that the biomimetic CSEP enhanced angiogenesis and functional anastomosis between the in vitro preformed human capillary networks and the mouse host vasculature. MicroCT analysis and osteocalcin staining show that the biomimetic CSEP/\u03b2-TCP graft formed more bone matrix compared to the other groups. These results suggest that the CSEP that mimics the cellular components and spatial configuration of periosteum plays a critical role in vascularization and osteogenesis.

{"title": "Evaluation of bovine luteal blood flow by using color Doppler ultrasonography.", "abstract": "Since luteal vascularization plays a decisive role for the function of the corpus luteum (CL), the investigation of luteal blood flow (LBF) might give valuable information about the physiology and patho-physiology of the CL. To quantify LBF, usually Power mode color Doppler ultrasonography is used. This method detects the number of red blood cells moving through the vessels and shows them as color pixels on the B-mode image of the CL. The area of color pixels is measured with computer-assisted image analysis software and is used as a semiquantitative parameter for the assessment of LBF. Although Power mode is superior for the evaluation of LBF compared to conventional color Doppler ultrasonography, which detects the velocity of blood cells, it is still not sufficiently sensitive to detect the blood flow in the small vessels in the center of the bovine CL. Therefore, blood flow can only be measured in the bigger luteal vessels in the outer edge of the CL. Color Doppler ultrasonographic studies of the bovine estrous cycle have shown that plasma progesterone (P4) concentration can be more reliably predicted by LBF than by luteal size (LS), especially during the CL regression. During the midluteal phase, cows with low P4 level showed smaller CL, but LBF, related to LS, did not differ between cows with low and high P4 levels. In contrast to non-pregnant cows, a significant rise in LBF was observed three weeks after insemination in pregnant cows. However, LBF was not useful for an early pregnancy diagnosis due to high LBF variation among cows. When the effects of an acute systemic inflammation and exogenous hormones on the CL are examined, the LBF determination is more sensitive than LS assessment. In conclusion, color Doppler ultrasonography of the bovine CL provides additional information on luteal function compared to measurements of LS and plasma P4, but its value as a parameter concerning assessment of fertility in cows has to be clarified.", "journal": "Reproductive biology", "date": "2014-05-27", "authors": ["JL\u00fcttgenau", "HBollwein"], "doi": "10.1016/j.repbio.2014.03.003"}

We have previously reported the generation of the first PCV model by transgenically expressing human HTRA1 (hHTRA1(+)), a multifunctional serine protease, in mouse RPE. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive examination of the PCV phenotypes (e.g., lesion type and distribution) of hHTRA1(+) mice by a variety of in vivo imaging techniques.\nWe generated improved hHTRA1(+) mice with a more consistent phenotype. Transgenic mice were examined by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), fluorescein angiography, funduscopy, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. In particular, we performed ICGA by tail vein injection of ICG to obtain high-quality ICGA comparable to human studies in terms of the three phases (early, middle, and late) of angiography.\nThe polyps can be detected in the early \"fill-in\" phase of ICGA, and most lesions become visible in the middle phase and are more distinct in the late phase with the fading of surrounding vessels. In addition to the two key features of PCV (polypoidal dilations and BVNs), hHTRA1(+) mice exhibit other features of PCV (i.e., late geographic hyperfluorescence, pigment epithelial detachment, and hyperfluorescent plaque). Polypoidal lesions appear as reddish orange nodules on funduscopy.\nTransgenic hHTRA1(+) mice exhibit a rich spectrum of \"clinical\" features that closely mimic human PCV. This animal model will serve as an invaluable tool for future mechanistic and translational studies of PCV and other forms of choroidal vasculopathies.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2014-05-24", "authors": ["SandeepKumar", "ZacharyBerriochoa", "Balamurali KAmbati", "YingbinFu"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.13-13111"}
{"title": "Renal bioengineering with scaffolds generated from human kidneys.", "abstract": "In 2012, about 16,487 people received kidney transplants in the USA whereas 95,022 candidates were on the waiting list at the end of the year. Moreover, more than 2,600 kidneys procured annually for transplantation are discarded for a variety of reasons. We hypothesize that this pool of discarded kidneys could in part meet the growing, urgent need for transplantable kidneys using current methods for organ bioengineering and regeneration and surgical transplantation. The recellularization of extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds has the potential to meet the uniquely ambitious engineering challenges posed by complex solid organs such as the kidney.\nAttempts to manufacture and implant simpler, hollow structures such as bladders, vessels, urethras, and segments of the upper airways have been successful in the short and mid terms. However, the bioengineering of complex solid organs such as the kidney is a more challenging task that requires a different approach. In previous studies, we showed that decellularized porcine kidneys yield renal ECM scaffolds that preserve their basic architecture and structural components, support cell growth in vivo and in vitro, and maintain a patent vasculature capable of sustaining physiological blood pressure. In a subsequent report, using the same methods, we found that detergent-based decellularization of discarded human renal kidneys preserved their innate ECM framework, biochemical properties, and angiogenic capacity and - importantly - a patent vascular network. Furthermore, the process resulted in the clearance of immunogenic antigens, which has monumental implications for clinical outcomes in the long term in terms of graft rejection. Consequently, these kidneys show promise in bioengineering and transplantation. We refer to this avenue of research and development as 'cell-scaffold technology'.\nIn 2011, more than 4,700 patients died while on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. In this context, we believe that cell-scaffold technology has the potential to form a bridge between regenerative medicine and transplantation surgery. These methods, in theory, could provide a potentially inexhaustible source of transplantable organs. Unfortunately, current investigations are still in their very early stages and clinical translation is not immediately available in the short term. Thus, identifying the most important obstacles confronting cell-scaffold technology and focusing research efforts in this direction will be important for advancing the state of the art and meeting the clinical needs. We believe that cell-scaffold technology research and development would benefit greatly from a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying the natural organogenesis, regeneration, and repair that characterize embryonic humans and simpler organisms.

The binding specificity of the agent was evaluated in human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP, and antagonist properties determined by cell internalization and intracellular calcium mobilization studies. The imaging sensitivity was assessed for the agent itself and for the PC3 cells labeled with agent. The in vivo stability of the agent was determined in human plasma and in the blood of living mice. The in vivo binding of the agent was evaluated in PC3 prostate tumor models in mice, and was validated ex vivo by optical imaging.\nAA3G-740 demonstrated strong and specific binding to GRPR. The sensitivity of detection in vitro indicated suitability of the agent to image very small lesions. In mice, the agent was able to bind to GRPR even in poorly vascularized tumors leading to nearly 2-fold difference in photoacoustic signal relative to the control agent.\nThe ability to image both vasculature and molecular profile outside the blood vessels gives molecular PAI a unique advantage over currently used imaging techniques.

We examined the impact of maternal Western-style diet consumption on the development of islet vascularization and innervation, both of which are critical to normal islet function, in fetal and juvenile offspring. Furthermore, we assessed whether improved dietary intake or resveratrol supplementation could ameliorate the harmful consequences of Western-style diet consumption during pregnancy. Adult female Japanese macaques were maintained on a control or Western-style diet for 4-7 yr. One cohort of dams was switched back onto a control diet, whereas another cohort received resveratrol supplementation throughout gestation. Pregnancies were terminated in the early third trimester by C-section, or offspring were born naturally and sent to necropsy at 1 yr of age. Western-style diet consumption resulted in impaired fetal islet capillary density and sympathetic islet innervation. Furthermore, this reduction in vascularization persisted in the juvenile offspring. This effect is independent of changes in the expression of key angiogenic markers. Diet reversal normalized islet vascularization to control offspring levels, whereas resveratrol supplementation caused a significant increase in capillary density above controls. These data provide a novel mechanism by which maternal Western-style diet consumption leads to increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the offspring.

Both open and endovascular techniques were included.\nA systematic review of key electronic journal databases was undertaken from inception to 22 March 2014. Studies comparing DR versus IR in patients with localised tissue loss were included. Meta-analysis was performed for wound healing, limb salvage, mortality, and re-intervention rates, with numerous sensitivity analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.\nFifteen cohort studies reporting on 1,868 individual limbs were included (endovascular revascularisation, 1,284 limbs; surgical revascularisation, 508 limbs; both methods, 76 limbs). GRADE quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. DR resulted in improved wound healing rates compared with IR (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.54) and improved limb salvage rates (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.45), although this latter effect was lost on high-quality study sensitivity analysis. Wound healing and limb salvage was improved for both open and endovascular intervention. There was no effect on mortality (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50-1.19) or reintervention rates (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.10-1.88).\nDR of the tibial vessels appears to result in improved wound healing and limb salvage rates compared with IR, with no effect on mortality or reintervention rates.

{"title": "Microvesicles as mediators of intercellular communication in cancer.", "abstract": "The discovery that cancer cells generate large membrane-enclosed packets of epigenetic information, known as microvesicles (MVs), that can be transferred to other cells and influence their behavior (Antonyak et al., Small GTPases 3:219-224, 2012; Cocucci et al., Trends Cell Biol 19:43-51, 2009; Rak, Semin Thromb Hemost 36:888-906, 2010; Skog et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:1470-1476, 2008) has added a unique perspective to the classical paracrine signaling paradigm. This is largely because, in addition to growth factors and cytokines, MVs contain a variety of components that are not usually thought to be released into the extracellular environment by viable cells including plasma membrane-associated proteins, cytosolic- and nuclear-localized proteins, as well as nucleic acids, particularly RNA transcripts and micro-RNAs (Skog et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:1470-1476, 2008; Al-Nedawi et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:619-624, 2008; Antonyak et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 108:4852-4857, 2011; Balaj et al., Nat Commun 2:180, 2011; Choi et al., J Proteome Res 6:4646-4655, 2007; Del Conde et al., Blood 106:1604-1611, 2005; Gallo et al., PLoS One 7:e30679, 2012; Graner et al., FASEB J 23:1541-1557, 2009; Grange et al., Cancer Res 71:5346-5356, 2011; Hosseini-Beheshti et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 11:863-885, 2012; Martins et al., Curr Opin Oncol 25:66-75, 2013; Noerholm et al., BMC Cancer 12:22, 2012; Zhuang et al., EMBO J 31:3513-3523, 2012). When transferred between cancer cells, MVs have been shown to stimulate signaling events that promote cell growth and survival (Al-Nedawi et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:619-624, 2008). Cancer cell-derived MVs can also be taken up by normal cell types that surround the tumor, an outcome that helps shape the tumor microenvironment, trigger tumor vascularization, and even confer upon normal recipient cells the transformed characteristics of a cancer cell (Antonyak et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 108:4852-4857, 2011; Martins et al., Curr Opin Oncol 25:66-75, 2013; Al-Nedawi et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 106:3794-3799, 2009; Ge et al., Cancer Microenviron 5:323-332, 2012). Thus, the production of MVs by cancer cells plays crucial roles in driving the expansion of the primary tumor. However, it is now becoming increasingly clear that MVs are also stable in the circulation of cancer patients, where they can mediate long-range effects and contribute to the formation of the pre-metastatic niche, an essential step in metastasis (Skog et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:1470-1476, 2008; Noerholm et al., BMC Cancer 12:22, 2012; Peinado et al., Nat Med 18:883-891, 2012; Piccin et al., Blood Rev 21:157-171, 2007; van der Vos et al., Cell Mol Neurobiol 31:949-959, 2011). These findings, when taken together with the fact that MVs are being aggressively pursued as diagnostic markers, as well as being considered as potential targets for intervention against cancer (Antonyak et al., Small GTPases 3:219-224, 2012; Hosseini-Beheshti et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 11:863-885, 2012; Martins et al., Curr Opin Oncol 25:66-75, 2013; Ge et al., Cancer Microenviron 5:323-332, 2012; Peinado et al., Nat Med 18:883-891, 2012; Piccin et al., Blood Rev 21:157-171, 2007; Al-Nedawi et al., Cell Cycle 8:2014-2018, 2009; Cocucci and Meldolesi, Curr Biol 21:R940-R941, 2011; D'Souza-Schorey and Clancy, Genes Dev 26:1287-1299, 2012; Shao et al., Nat Med 18:1835-1840, 2012), point to critically important roles for MVs in human cancer progression that can potentially be exploited to develop new targeted approaches for treating this disease.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2014-05-20", "authors": ["Marc AAntonyak", "Richard ACerione"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-0856-1_11"}

This event can be overcome by Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) antibody treatment. Collectively, these studies identify a novel CCN1 signaling program in pancreatic cancer cells which activates SHh through autocrine-paracrine circuits to promote endothelial cell migration and tumor angiogenesis and suggests that CCN1 signaling of pancreatic cancer cells is vital for the regulation of tumor angiogenesis.

Each nephron is composed of a large renal corpuscle with well vascularized glomerulus, ciliated neck segment, proximal tubule divided into first and second proximal segments, ciliated intermediate segment, distal tubule, collecting tubule, and duct. The podocytes of visceral epithelium contain large bi-lobed nuclei and their surface membranes pinch off vesicles into the cytoplasm. The processes of the podocytes give rise to pedicels that enclose narrow filtration slits. The endothelium of glomerular capillaries is attenuated and fenestrated. The short cytoplasmic processes of mesangial cells do not penetrate deeply into the sub-endothelial lamina. The glomerular basement membrane is about 286 nm in thickness. The pedicels also arise from podocyte cell bodies, and are connected by diaphragms and enclose slits, which open into narrow urinary spaces between podocytes. The cuboidal cells of the short neck segment display cilia with a characteristic pattern of 9+2 microtubules. The first proximal tubule segment differs from the second proximal segment in having densely packed microvilli, prominent endocytotic-lysosomal apparatus, and numerous basal membrane infoldings associated with mitochondria. The lateral cell membranes like those of other segments are straight and joined by desmosomes and apical adhering and tight junctions. The distal tubules display few short luminal microvilli and numerous basal mitochondria. The distal tubule, collecting tubule and duct are devoid of intercalated cells.

In this study, we examined how the treatment of mid-pregnant mice with KRN633 affects the development and morphology of vascular components (endothelial cells, pericytes, and basement membrane) in the retinas of their newborn pups. Pregnant mice were treated with KRN633 (5 mg/kg) once daily from embryonic day 13.5 until the day of delivery. Vascular components were examined using immunohistochemistry with specific markers for each component. Radial vascular growth in the retina was slightly delayed until postnatal day 4 (P4) in the newborn pups of KRN633-treated mothers. On P8, compared with the pups of control mothers, the pups of KRN633-treated mothers exhibited decreased numbers of central arteries and veins and abnormal branching of the central arteries. No apparent differences in pericytes or basement membrane were observed between the pups of control and KRN633-treated mothers. These results suggest that a critical period for determining retinal vascular patterning is present at the earliest stages of retinal vascular development, and that the impaired vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during this period induces abnormal architecture in the retinal vascular network.", "journal": "Birth defects research.

Four experimental groups were carried out, namely, the syngeneic partial femur transplantation, allogeneic partial femur transplantation with or without cyclosporine A, and allogeneic whole femur transplantation with cyclosporine A. The results showed that the partial femur model was technically simpler and shortened the operative and ischemia time compared to the whole femur model. Gross and histologic appearance confirmed the viability of femur, and its bone marrow inside the bone could also maintain normal morphologically at 60-day posttransplant. Besides, donor multilineage chimerism could be continuously detected in immunosuppressed allogeneic partial femur recipients at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 8-week posttransplant, and it showed no significant differences when compared with whole femur transplantation. Meanwhile, long-term engraftment of donor-origin cells was also confirmed in recipients' bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, but not in thymus.

Restoration of normal scaphoid anatomy at an earlier stage might have functional benefits as maladaptive carpal ligament contractures and the development of preliminary osteoarthritis could be avoided. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if late reconstruction (delayed reconstruction group) was as effective as early reconstruction (early reconstruction group) of scaphoid non-union in restoring clinical and radiological outcome.\nThe early reconstruction group included patients who underwent surgery between 6 and 12 months after the original fracture. This group consisted of 14 male and 2 female patients. The delayed reconstruction group included patients who underwent surgery 12 or more months after the original fracture. This group consisted of 9 male and 1 female patients. Average time from injury to surgery in the early reconstruction group was 10 months (range 6-12 months) and mean postoperative follow-up period averaged 58 months (range 19-72 months). Average time from injury to surgery in the delayed reconstruction group was 69 months (range 12-88 months) and mean postoperative follow-up period averaged 62 months (range 24-80 months). All patients showed a humpback deformity as well as a DISI deformity with the radiolunate angle being greater than 15\u00b0. The outcome was assessed on the basis of measurement of active wrist range of motion and grip power. Wrist pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Functional subjective outcome was evaluated with the DASH and PRWE scores. Results were compared to preoperative measurements as well as to the uninjured contralateral side. Pre- and post-operative radiographs were assessed for scapholunate angle (SLA) as a measure of palmar rotation and radiolunate angle (RLA). The presence of DISI was defined by a difference of >60\u00b0 for the SLA or of >10\u00b0 for the RLA between the affected and unaffected wrist.\nIn the early reconstruction group bone union and correction of DISI deformity could be achieved for all patients (n = 16). In the delayed reconstruction group bone union could only be achieved without correction of the DISI deformity in six patients (60 %). In four patients (40 %) of the delayed reconstruction group non-union persisted. For the early reconstruction group at final follow-up mean flexion-extension arc, mean ulnar-radial-deviation arc and mean grip strength were 82, 91.5 and 82 % of uninjured side, respectively. Mean pain level decreased from 6 points before surgery to 1 point at final follow-up. The preoperative DASH changed from 48 to 17 and the preoperative PRWE changed from 30 to 14. The SLA changed from 51\u00b0 to 48\u00b0 and the RLA from 18\u00b0 to 9\u00b0. Six patients from delayed reconstruction group showed bone union, but no correction of DISI deformity at final follow-up. Functional and radiological results showed only slight improvement. The remaining four patients from delayed reconstruction group with a persistent non-union continued to experience pain, reduced grip strength and limited range of wrist movement and DISI deformity persisted.\nIn conclusion, wedge-shaped bone grafting of scaphoid non-union leads to increased functional scores as well as to improved carpal angles as long as bony union can be achieved. Remaining non-union and the inability to correct DISI deformity are severely correlated with an increased time frame between fracture and surgical treatment.

For in vivo electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) monitoring, two electrodes were anchored to construct edges, covered by NanoGold particles and connected to an impedance-based implantable device. Histological evaluation was performed to identify and characterize GFP cells on post mortem myocardial sections.\nPluripotency, cardiomyogenic and endothelial potential and migratory capacity of porcine-derived MATPCs were demonstrated in vitro. Decellularization protocol efficiency, biodegradability, as well as in vitro biocompatibility after recellularization were also verified. One month after myocardial bioprosthesis implantation, morphometry revealed a 36% reduction in infarct area, Ki67(+)-GFP(+)-MATPCs were found at infarct core and border zones, and bioprosthesis vascularization was confirmed by presence of Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I (GSLI) B4 isolectin(+)-GFP(+)-MATPCs.

Ten patients showing edentulous posterior maxilla underwent maxillary sinus augmentation through particulate equine bone substitute and 10 patients through particulate porcine bone substitute. At the moment of implants insertion, 6 months after grafting, bone specimens were withdrawn and processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses. Notwithstanding the almost comparable clinical performances of both bone substitutes, histological results showed a better integration when an equine bone substitute was used compared to a porcine one. In particular, evident signs of particles resorption were observed in equine bone substitute group specimens compared to porcine ones. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a statistically significant increase of VEGF expression in equine compared to porcine bone substitute group specimens. These results showed both bone substitutes to achieve comparable clinical performance, indicating their successful use for bone regenerative procedures. However, in the same experimental time, equine group specimens showed evident resorption phenomena, whereas no or little signs of resorption were evident in the porcine group specimens. However, a more rapid and intense vascularization was achieved in equine bone substitute group, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis for VEGF expression. Even if differences in vascularization significantly affect the clinical performance of a heterologous bone substitute, its ability to be resorbed is also very important in influencing long-term integration and long-term predictability of implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in regenerated sites.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2014-05-14", "authors": ["StefanoTet\u00e8", "Vincenzo LucaZizzari", "RaffaeleVinci", "SusiZara", "UmbertoDi Tore", "MarcoManica", "AmeliaCataldi", "CarmenMortellaro", "AdrianoPiattelli", "EnricoGherlone"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000000679"}

In this study, we examined the therapeutic potential of implantation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) isolated from Wharton's jelly of human umbilical cords in the treatment of renal I/R injury in mice. To visualize the localization of the transplanted EPCs, the cells were labeled with Q-tracker before injection into the renal capsule. Mice with renal I/R injury showed a significant increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and these effects were decreased by EPC transplantation. The kidney injury score in the mice with I/R injury was also significantly decreased by EPC transplantation. EPC transplantation increased the microvascular density, and some of the EPCs surrounded and were incorporated into microvessels. In addition, EPC transplantation inhibited the I/R-induced cell apoptosis of endothelial, glomerular, and renal tubular cells, as demonstrated by TUNEL staining, and significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production and the expression of the inflammatory chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine, as shown by immunostaining and ELISA. Moreover, EPC transplantation reduced I/R-induced fibrosis, as demonstrated by immunostaining for S100A4, a fibroblast marker, and by Jones silver staining.

We previously demonstrated that, in vAT of mice at early state of ageing, adipocytes mount a stress resistance response consisting in the upregulation of ATGL, which is functional in restraining the production of inflammatory cytokines. Here, we found that, in the late phase of ageing, such an adaptive response is impaired. In particular, 24-months-old mice and aged 3T3-L1 adipocytes display affected expression of ATGL and its downstream PPAR\u03b1-mediated lipid signalling pathway, leading to upregulation of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production. We show that the natural polyphenol compound resveratrol (RSV) efficiently suppresses the expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 in an ATGL/PPAR\u03b1 dependent manner. Actually, adipocytes downregulating ATGL do not show a restored PPAR\u03b1 expression and display elevated cytokines production.

To test this hypothesis, we decellularized porcine renal arteries, stabilized elastin with penta-galloyl glucose and collagen with carbodiimide/activated heparin and implanted them as transposition grafts in the abdominal aorta of rats as direct implants and separately as indirect, isolation-loop implants. All implants resulted in high patency and animal survival rates, ubiquitous encapsulation within a vascularized collagenous capsule, and exhibited lack of lumen thrombogenicity and no graft wall calcification.

{"title": "Cell-generated traction forces and the resulting matrix deformation modulate microvascular alignment and growth during angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The details of the mechanical factors that modulate angiogenesis remain poorly understood. Previous in vitro studies of angiogenesis using microvessel fragments cultured within collagen constructs demonstrated that neovessel alignment can be induced via mechanical constraint of the boundaries (i.e., boundary conditions). The objective of this study was to investigate the role of mechanical boundary conditions in the regulation of angiogenic alignment and growth in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. Angiogenic microvessels within three-dimensional constructs were subjected to different boundary conditions, thus producing different stress and strain fields during growth. Neovessel outgrowth and orientation were quantified from confocal image data after 6 days. Vascularity and branching decreased as the amount of constraint imposed on the culture increased. In long-axis constrained hexahedral constructs, microvessels aligned parallel to the constrained axis. In contrast, constructs that were constrained along the short axis had random microvessel orientation. Finite element models were used to simulate the contraction of gels under the various boundary conditions and to predict the local strain field experienced by microvessels. Results from the experiments and simulations demonstrated that microvessels aligned perpendicular to directions of compressive strain. Alignment was due to anisotropic deformation of the matrix from cell-generated traction forces interacting with the mechanical boundary conditions. These findings demonstrate that boundary conditions and thus the effective stiffness of the matrix regulate angiogenesis.

To address the need for more innovative skeletal muscle repair options, our laboratory has developed scaffoldless tissue-engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs), multiphasic tissue constructs composed of engineered skeletal muscle with engineered bone-tendon ends, myotendinous junctions, and entheses, which in vitro can produce force both spontaneously and in response to electrical stimulation. Though phenotypically immature in vitro, we have shown that following 1 week of implantation in an ectopic site, our muscle constructs develop vascularization and innervation, an epimysium-like outer layer of connective tissue, an increase in myosin protein content, formation of myofibers, and increased force production. These findings suggest that our engineered muscle tissue survives implantation and develops the interfaces necessary to advance the phenotype toward adult muscle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of our SMUs to restore muscle tissue to sites of acute VML. Our results indicate that our SMUs continue to mature in vivo with longer recovery times and have the potential to repair VML sites by providing additional muscle fibers to damaged muscles. We conclude from this study that our SMUs have the potential to restore lost tissue volume in cases of acute VML.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

These features include transplant vasculopathy with intimal hyperplasia, tertiary lymphoid follicles, graft fibrosis, and graft edema. Transplant vasculopathy has been the most consistent finding across cases, and has resulted in graft dysfunction and loss. Antibody-mediated rejection has not been conclusively reported in animal models or human subjects, although some cases have demonstrated donor-specific antibody in conjunction with C4d deposition. Multiple immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms of VCA chronic rejection have been proposed.\nAs in solid organ transplantation, chronic rejection in VCA remains ill-defined. Transplant vasculopathy appears to be a key feature of chronic VCA rejection, whereas tertiary lymphoid follicles, graft fibrosis, and graft edema appear to be less-specific findings.

While many of the different MMPs expressed in breast cancer are produced by stromal cells MMP-9 is produced mainly by the tumor cells themselves. To date, the functional role of tumor cell-produced MMP-9 has remained unclear. Here, we show that human breast cancer cell-produced MMP-9 is specifically required for invasion in cell culture and for pulmonary metastasis in a mouse orthotopic model of basal-like breast cancer. We also find that tumor cell-produced MMP-9 promotes tumor vascularization with only modest impact on primary tumor growth, and that silencing of MMP-9 expression in tumor cells leads to an altered transcriptional program consistent with reversion to a less malignant phenotype. MMP-9 is most highly expressed in human basal-like and triple negative tumors, where our data suggest that it contributes to metastatic progression.

Fifteen gilts DB-90 (DanBred) were divided into three groups according to gestational age at slaughter (50, 80, and 106 days). After slaughter, fetuses and placentas were collected, weighed, and measured. The uterine arterial system was detached by latex repletion for quantification of the number and diameter of the terminal vessels in different regions of the uterine horns (apex, middle region, and base). Fetal and placental measurements were statistically analyzed and correlated with the number and diameter of arteries in each uterine segment. No correlation was observed (P > 0.10) between the number and diameter of arteries destined to the uterus with the number or weight of fetuses or placental weight in any gestational group. It was observed (P < 0.05) that more vessels destined to the medium region of the uterine horns, independent of the gestational age or uterus side. At the 80th day of gestation, fetuses located at the base of the uterus have (P < 0.05) smaller cephalic and thoracic perimeters. It was concluded that there were differences in vascularization of broad ligament that irrigates the different uterine segments, but this was not sufficient to influence the development of fetuses in gilts.

Using a human embryonic stem cell reporter cell line, where green fluorescent protein expression is driven by an endothelial cell-specific VE-cadherin (VEC) promoter, we screened for > 60 bioactive small molecules that would promote endothelial differentiation, and found that administration of BMP4 and a GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor in an early phase and treatment with VEGF-A and inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway in a later phase led to efficient differentiation of hPSCs to the endothelial lineage within six days. This sequential approach generated > 50% conversion of hPSCs to endothelial cells (ECs), specifically VEC(+)CD31(+)CD34(+)CD14(-)KDR(high) endothelial progenitors (EPs) that exhibited higher angiogenic and clonogenic proliferation potential among endothelial lineage cells. Pharmaceutical inhibition or genetical knockdown of Notch signaling, in combination with VEGF-A treatment, resulted in efficient formation of EPs via KDR(+) mesodermal precursors and blockade of the conversion of EPs to mature ECs. The generated EPs successfully formed functional capillary vessels in vivo with anastomosis to the host vessels when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Manipulation of this VEGF-A-Notch signaling circuit in our protocol leads to rapid large-scale production of the hPSC-derived EPs by 12- to 20-fold vs current methods, which may serve as an attractive cell population for regenerative vascularization with superior vessel forming capability compared to mature ECs.", "journal": "Cell research", "date": "2014-05-09", "authors": ["MakotoSahara", "Emil MHansson", "OliverWernet", "Kathy OLui", "DanielaSp\u00e4ter", "Kenneth RChien"], "doi": "10.1038/cr.2014.59"}

Among 13 PLC isozymes, PLC\u03b41 and PLC\u03b43 share high sequence homology and similar tissue distribution, and are expected to have functional redundancy in many tissues. We previously reported that the simultaneous loss of PLC\u03b41 and PLC\u03b43 caused embryonic lethality because of excessive apoptosis and impaired vascularization of the placenta. Prenatal death of PLC\u03b41/PLC\u03b43 double-knockout mice hampered our investigation of the roles of these genes in adult animals. Here, we generated PLC\u03b41/PLC\u03b43 double-knockout mice that expressed PLC\u03b41 in extra-embryonic tissues (cDKO mice) to escape embryonic lethality. The cDKO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, which indicated that the simultaneous loss of PLC\u03b41 and PLC\u03b43 in the embryo proper did not impair embryonic development. However, half of the cDKO mice died prematurely. In addition, the surviving cDKO mice spontaneously showed cardiac abnormalities, such as increased heart weight/tibial length ratios, impaired cardiac function, cardiac fibrosis, dilation, and hypertrophy. Predating these abnormalities, excessive apoptosis of their cardiomyocytes was observed. In addition, siRNA-mediated simultaneous silencing of PLC\u03b41 and PLC\u03b43 increased apoptosis in differentiated-H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Activation of Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) \u03b8 was impaired in the hearts of the cDKO mice. siRNA-mediated simultaneous silencing of PLC\u03b41 and PLC\u03b43 also decreased activated Akt and PKC\u03b8 in differentiated-H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.

{"title": "Sema3A maintains corneal avascularity during development by inhibiting Vegf induced angioblast migration.", "abstract": "Corneal avascularity is important for optical clarity and normal vision. However, the molecular mechanisms that prevent angioblast migration and vascularization of the developing cornea are not clear. Previously we showed that periocular angioblasts and forming ocular blood vessels avoid the presumptive cornea despite dynamic ingression of neural crest cells. In the current study, we investigate the role of Semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a cell guidance chemorepellent, on angioblast migration and corneal avascularity during development. We show that Sema3A, Vegf, and Nrp1 are expressed in the anterior eye during cornea development. Sema3A mRNA transcripts are expressed at significantly higher levels than Vegf in the lens that is positioned adjacent to the presumptive cornea. Blockade of Sema3A signaling via lens removal or injection of a synthetic Sema3A inhibitor causes ectopic migration of angioblasts into the cornea and results in its subsequent vascularization. In addition, using bead implantation, we demonstrate that exogenous Sema3A protein inhibits Vegf-induced vascularization of the cornea. In agreement with these findings, loss of Sema/Nrp1 signaling in Nrp1(Sema-) mutant mice results in ectopic angioblasts and vascularization of the embryonic mouse corneas. Altogether, our results reveal Sema3A signaling as an important cue during the establishment of corneal avascularity in both chick and mouse embryos.

However, tumors that initially respond to this therapy invariably recur with the acquisition of a highly aggressive and invasive phenotype. Although several myeloid populations have been associated to this pattern of recurrence, a specific targetable population has not been yet identified. Here, we present evidence for the accumulation of Tie2-expressing monocytes/macrophages (TEMs) at the tumor/normal brain interface of mice treated with anti-VEGF therapies in regions with heightened tumoral invasion. Furthermore, we describe the presence of TEMs in malignant glioma surgical specimens that recurred after bevacizumab treatment. Our studies showed that TEMs enhanced the invasive properties of glioma cells and secreted high levels of gelatinase enzymatic proteins. Accordingly, Tie2\u207aMMP9\u207a monocytic cells were consistently detected in the invasive tumor edge upon anti-VEGF therapies.

Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses of cerebral cortex sections included immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and collagen type IV (a molecular component of the vascular basal lamina) to determine the glial vascular network in fetal brains and Ki67 as a proliferation marker. Cerebral cortices from I/R-48 and I/R-72 fetuses exhibited general responses to ischemia, including reactive astrocyte morphology, which was not observed in Non-I/R fetuses.

Morphometric analysis of the Non-I/R group with the I/R-48 and I/R-72 groups revealed increased collagen type IV density in I/R-72 cerebral cortex microvessels (p < 0.01), which also frequently displayed a sprouting appearance characterized by growing tip cells and activated pericytes.

In this study, we used biotinylated polyurethane-urea nanoparticles as a model to examine the applicabitility of an adapted hemagglutination assay to quantify the bioadhesive potential of these nanoparticles to red blood cells and, in turn, to extrapolate this data to vascular endothelial cells. We demonstrated that biotinylated nanoparticles adsorb to human erythrocytes and preferentially gather in erythrocyte contact areas. Moreover, these nanoparticles promoted a higher percentage of pig and human erythrocyte agglutination than naked polyurethane-urea nanoparticles in a biotin concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, pegylated nanoparticles were used as a negative control of the technique thus showing decreasing hemagglutination values as compared to naked nanoparticles until a minimum threshold. Furthermore, hemagglutination assay demonstrated an excellent positive correlation with bioadhesion quantification in human endothelial cells and the endothelial layer of pig aorta thus validating the hemagglutination assay described here as a useful method for predicting nanoparticle bioadhesivity to vascular endothelium.

Initial suppression, followed by increased production of the retinal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) expression are key events that trigger the pathological neovascularization in ROP. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an intracellular lipid chaperone that is induced by VEGF in a subset of endothelial cells. FABP4 exhibits a pro-angiogenic function in cultured endothelial cells and in airway microvasculature, but whether it plays a role in modulation of retinal angiogenesis is not known. We hypothesized that FABP4 deficiency could ameliorate pathological retinal vascularization and investigated this hypothesis using a well-characterized mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We found that FABP4 was not expressed in retinal vessels, but was present in resident macrophages/microglial cells and endothelial cells of the hyaloid vasculature in the immature retina. While FABP4 expression was not required for normal development of retinal vessels, FABP4 expression was upregulated and localized to neovascular tufts in OIR. FABP4-/- mice demonstrated a significant decrease in neovessel formation as well as a significant improvement in physiological revascularization of the avascular retinal tissues. These alterations in retinal vasculature were accompanied by reduced endothelial cell proliferation, but no effect on apoptosis or macrophage/microglia recruitment.

This composite tissue was used for reconstruction of an excised sternoclavicular joint following infection or chondrosarcoma. The proximal phalanx was dowel-jointed into the manubrium and fixed with 1 or 2 screws; the metatarsal was plated to the remaining clavicle. The joint was oriented to allow maximal elevation and restricted depression, and the normal mediolateral laxity allowed anterior and posterior movement. Vascular anastomoses were performed to branches of the thoracoacromial axis vessels, and digital nerves were connected to a supraclavicular nerve.\nTwo patients had their excised sternoclavicular joints reconstructed using this technique. Both achieved union at the clavicular and sternal junctions. Both obtained restoration of movement of the sternoclavicular joint and upper limb. One patient developed joint subluxation and pain requiring tendon graft reconstruction of the costoclavicular ligament.\nIn these 2 cases, the vascularized second toe metatarsophalangeal joint satisfactorily reconstructed the widely excised sternoclavicular joint and costoclavicular ligament and restored function.\nTherapeutic IV.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2014-05-07", "authors": ["Charlotte LBendon", "Henk PGiele"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2014.03.027"}

In the present study we investigated whether C-ANP4-23 could also inhibit angiogenesis in the sponge model in vivo. To this end, we evaluated the effects of C-ANP4-23 on inflammatory and angiogenic components of the fibrovascular tissue induced by polyether polyurethane sponge implants in mice. Measurements of the haemoglobin content (\u03bcg/mg wet tissue) and blood flow (laser Doppler perfusion imaging) of the implants, used as an index of vascularization, revealed that single (200\u00a0ng) or multiple (200\u00a0ng/day, 5\u00a0days) doses of C-ANP4-23 reduced angiogenesis in the implants relative to the phosphate-buffered saline-treated group. The peptide exerted an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production (nitrite levels) and had a dual effect on VEGF levels, depending on the number of doses (i.e. stimulation at 4\u00a0days after one dose; inhibition at 7\u00a0days after five doses). Histological analysis corroborated the biochemical and functional parameters indicative of inhibition of neovascularization (decreased vessel number) by C-ANP4-23 . The peptide failed to modulate inflammation in our system. The inhibitory effect of C-ANP4-23 on the angiogenic component of the fibrovascular tissue induced by the synthetic matrix extends the range of the its actions and may indicate its therapeutic potential in controlling angiogenesis in fibroproliferative diseases.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology", "date": "2014-05-07", "authors": ["Simone AAlmeida", "Cibele CCardoso", "Laura AaOrellano", "Adelina MReis", "Luc\u00edola SBarcelos", "Silvia PAndrade"], "doi": "10.1111/1440-1681.12251"}

No correlation was found between placental volume and placental vascular indices.\nThe values of placental vascular indices are constant between the 22nd and 41st week of a normal pregnancy. Placental volume measured with the use of the VOCAL program increases between 22nd and 41st week of a normal pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy the placental vasculature increases adequately to the increase of its volume.

Although abdominal wall transplantation was reported 10 years ago this, technique has not been widely adopted, partly due to its complexity, but largely because of concerns that storing the abdominal allograft until the end of a prolonged intestinal transplant procedure would cause severe ischemia-reperfusion injury. We report six cases of combined small bowel and abdominal wall transplantation where the ischemic time was minimized by remotely revascularizing the abdominal wall on the forearm vessels, synchronous to the intestinal procedure. When the visceral transplant was complete, the abdominal wall was removed from the forearm and revascularized on the abdomen (n = 4), or used to close the abdomen while still vascularized on the forearm (n = 2). Primary abdominal wall closure was achieved in all. Mean cold ischemia was 305 min (300-330 min), and revascularization on the arm was 50 min (30-60 min). Three patients had proven abdominal wall rejection, all treated successfully. Immediate revascularization of the abdominal wall allograft substantially reduces cold ischemia without imposing constraints on the intestinal transplant.

The pathological diagnosis identified 11 cases of ameloblastoma, 3 cases of odontogenic keratocyst, and 1 case of odontogenic myxoma. According to the Urken's CRBS (Condyle, Ramus, Body, Symphysis) classification criteria based on the location of the mandibular defect, there were 3 cases of body type (B type), 3 cases of ramus type (R type), and 9 cases of body and ramus type (BR type). The surgeries were performed via an intraoral approach, except 1 patient with the lesion at the level of sigmoid notch via an auxiliary preauricular incision. To fix the bone grafts to the dissected mandibular defects, reconstructive titanium plates were used, either indirectly according to the computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing mandibular models before surgery (9 patients) or directly according to the exposed mandibles during surgery (6 patients). The patients received benign mandibular tumor resection and primary autogenous bone graft reconstruction with free iliac bones (11 cases) or vascularized fibular flaps (4 cases).

This study tested the hypothesis that the advantage to the featherless broiler condition with respect to breast meat yield and quality is due to differences in muscle development during pre- and posthatch periods. Broilers from the 3 genetic groups were reared under normal (26\u00b0C) and hot (32\u00b0C) conditions and slaughtered on d 29 and 47. Evaluation of myofiber diameter (mean and distribution) and blood-vessel density in breast muscle sections sampled on these days revealed that the fluctuations in breast muscle yields of the different genetic groups under different temperature conditions and the better muscle growth of the featherless broilers are due to changes in muscle hypertrophy and vascularization. In addition, the featherless broilers presented continuous satellite cell proliferation and a slower rate of differentiation compared with the feathered broilers on immediate posthatch period, suggesting a higher reserve of myogenic progeny cells that will contribute to later muscle hypertrophy. In the embryos, breast muscle yield was higher for the featherless versus feathered counterparts between embryonic day (E) 15 and E20. This was manifested in a shift toward higher myofiber diameters in the featherless embryos on E18, and a higher number of myoblasts, which could be explained by higher insulin-like growth factor-I levels in the muscle tissue and lower triiodothyronine levels in the plasma on E17. Together, the data show the advantage of being featherless under hot conditions with regard to breast muscle growth and hypertrophy, and overall performance. Moreover, featherless embryos had increased breast muscle weight compared with their feathered counterparts, likely due to a higher proliferation rate of myoblasts and higher muscle hypertrophy.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2014-05-06", "authors": ["YairHadad", "AvigdorCahaner", "OrnaHalevy"], "doi": "10.3382/ps.2013-03592"}

{"title": "Control of angiogenesis by galectins involves the release of platelet-derived proangiogenic factors.", "abstract": "Platelets contribute to vessel formation through the release of angiogenesis-modulating factors stored in their \u03b1-granules. Galectins, a family of lectins that bind \u03b2-galactoside residues, are up-regulated in inflammatory and cancerous tissues, trigger platelet activation and mediate vascularization processes. Here we aimed to elucidate whether the release of platelet-derived proangiogenic molecules could represent an alternative mechanism through which galectins promote neovascularization. We show that different members of the galectin family can selectively regulate the release of angiogenic molecules by human platelets. Whereas Galectin (Gal)-1, -3, and -8 triggered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release, only Gal-8 induced endostatin secretion. Release of VEGF induced by Gal-8 was partially prevented by COX-1, PKC, p38 and Src kinases inhibitors, whereas Gal-1-induced VEGF secretion was inhibited by PKC and ERK blockade, and Gal-3 triggered VEGF release selectively through a PKC-dependent pathway. Regarding endostatin, Gal-8 failed to stimulate its release in the presence of PKC, Src and ERK inhibitors, whereas aspirin or p38 inhibitor had no effect on endostatin release. Despite VEGF or endostatin secretion, platelet releasates generated by stimulation with each galectin stimulated angiogenic responses in vitro including endothelial cell proliferation and tubulogenesis. The platelet angiogenic activity was independent of VEGF and was attributed to the concerted action of other proangiogenic molecules distinctly released by each galectin. Thus, secretion of platelet-derived angiogenic molecules may represent an alternative mechanism by which galectins promote angiogenic responses and its selective blockade may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-05-03", "authors": ["JuliaEtulain", "SoledadNegrotto", "Mar\u00eda VirginiaTribulatti", "Diego OmarCroci", "JulietaCarabelli", "OscarCampetella", "Gabriel Adri\u00e1nRabinovich", "MirtaSchattner"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0096402"}
{"title": "Type-2 pericytes participate in normal and tumoral angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Tissue growth and function depend on vascularization, and vascular insufficiency or excess exacerbates many human diseases. Identification of the biological processes involved in angiogenesis will dictate strategies to modulate reduced or excessive vessel formation. We examine the essential role of pericytes. Their heterogeneous morphology, distribution, origins, and physiology have been described. Using double-transgenic Nestin-GFP/NG2-DsRed mice, we identified two pericyte subsets. We found that Nestin-GFP(-)/NG2-DsRed(+) (type-1) and Nestin-GFP(+)/NG2-DsRed(+) (type-2) pericytes attach to the walls of small and large blood vessels in vivo; in vitro, type-2, but not type-1, pericytes spark endothelial cells to form new vessels. Matrigel assay showed that only type-2 pericytes participate in normal angiogenesis. Moreover, when cancer cells were transplanted into Nestin-GFP/NG2-DsRed mice, type-1 pericytes did not penetrate the tumor, while type-2 pericytes were recruited during its angiogenesis. As inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising strategy in cancer therapy, type-2 pericytes may provide a cellular target susceptible to signaling and pharmacological manipulation in treating malignancy.

Here we show that depletion of all microRNAs suppresses tumor angiogenesis. We generated microRNA-deficient tumors by knocking out Dicer1. These tumors are highly hypoxic but poorly vascularized, suggestive of deficient angiogenesis signaling. Expression profiling revealed that angiogenesis genes were significantly down-regulated as a result of the microRNA deficiency. Factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), FIH1, is derepressed under these conditions and suppresses HIF transcription. Knocking out FIH1 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering reversed the phenotypes of microRNA-deficient cells in HIF transcriptional activity, VEGF production, tumor hypoxia, and tumor angiogenesis. Using multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9, we deleted regions in FIH1 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain microRNA-binding sites, which derepresses FIH1 protein and represses hypoxia response.

The spectacle is completely renewed during ecdysis. Combined scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and conventional macrophotography were used to image this phenomenon.\nA spectral OCT/SLO examination and macrophotography were performed in four healthy adult corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) and one healthy adult California king snake (Lampropeltis getulus californiae) the day before the start of ecdysis and then daily during ecdysis.\nIn all animals, ecdysis lasted 5\u00a0days. The spectacle was hardly visible at baseline, but became obvious at day one, while the subspectacular space became larger and the superficial cornea presented a hyperechoic band. At day two, eye surface became translucent, and at the same time, vascularization of the spectacle was visible using SLO. At day 3, the vascularization was no longer visible, while the subspectacular space increased and the eye surface remained translucent. At day 4, the eye surface was transparent and the superficial hyperechoic band started to become less bright. At day 5, the old spectacle was shed and all the parameters returned to baseline.\nWe hypothesize that the echogenicity modifications of the anterior cornea correspond to major metabolic activity associated with new spectacle formation. This increased metabolic activity may contribute to the neovascularization and play an important role in the accumulation of fluid in the subspectacular space, facilitating the shedding of the old spectacle.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2014-05-03", "authors": ["GuillaumeCazalot", "FranckRival", "AdelineLinsart", "Pierre-Fran\u00e7oisIsard", "MarionTissier", "Robert LouisPeiffer", "ThomasDulaurent"], "doi": "10.1111/vop.12174"}

We investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of the hormone progesterone (P4) on the growth of human GBM in four genetically different cell lines (U87MG, U87dEGFR, U118MG, LN-229) in vitro and in a U87MG subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. At high concentrations (20, 40, and 80 \u03bcM), P4 significantly (P<0.05) decreased tumor cell viability in all cell lines except LN-229. This effect was not blocked by the P4 receptor antagonist RU468. Conversely, at low physiological concentrations (0.1, 1, and 5 \u03bcM) P4 showed a proliferative effect in all cell lines which was blocked by RU486. In nude mice, P4 (100 and 200 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth significantly (P<0.05) over 5 weeks of treatment and extended survival time of tumor-bearing mice by 60% without signs of systemic toxicity. P4 suppressed tumor vascularization as indicated by the expression of CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Apoptosis in tumor tissue was detected by the expression of cleaved caspase-3, BCl-2, BAD and p53 proteins and confirmed by TUNEL assay. P4 treatment also suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which regulates tumor growth, as demonstrated by the suppression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Our data can be interpreted to suggest that P4 suppresses the growth of human GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo and enhances survival time in mice without any demonstrable side effects.

We have developed a (64)Cu pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP) for targeting, imaging, and quantifying acidic tumors by PET, and our findings reveal utility in assessing prostate tumors. The new pHLIP version limits indiscriminate healthy tissue binding, and we demonstrate its targeting of extracellular acidification in three different prostate cancer models, each with different vascularization and acid-extruding protein carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) expression. We then describe the tumor distribution of this radiotracer ex vivo, in association with blood perfusion and known biomarkers of acidity, such as hypoxia, lactate dehydrogenase A, and CAIX.

Late-stage embryonic lung development is driven by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors Hif-1\u03b1 and Hif-2\u03b1, which act as important regulators for lung development. Expression of the BTB-and kelch-domain-containing (BTB-kelch) protein KLEIP (Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein; also named Klhl20) is controlled by two hypoxia response elements, and KLEIP regulates stabilization and transcriptional activation of Hif-2\u03b1. Based on the available data, we hypothesized an essential role for KLEIP in murine lung development and function. Therefore, we have performed a functional, histological, mechanistic and interventional study in embryonic and neonatal KLEIP(-/-) mice. Here, we show that about half of the KLEIP(-/-) neonates die due to respiratory failure that is caused by insufficient aeration, reduced septal thinning, reduced glycogenolysis, type II pneumocyte immaturity and reduced surfactant production. Expression analyses in embryonic day (E) 18.5 lungs identified KLEIP in lung capillaries, and showed strongly reduced mRNA and protein levels for Hif-2\u03b1 and VEGF; such reduced levels are associated with embryonic endothelial cell apoptosis and lung bleedings. Betamethasone injection in pregnant females prevented respiratory failure in KLEIP(-/-) neonates, normalized lung maturation, vascularization, aeration and function, and increased neonatal Hif-2\u03b1 expression. Thus, the experimental study shows that respiratory failure in KLEIP(-/-) neonates is determined by insufficient angiocrine Hif-2\u03b1-VEGF signaling and that betamethasone activates this newly identified signaling cascade in late-stage embryonic lung development.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2014-05-03", "authors": ["NicoleWoik", "Christian TDietz", "KathrinSch\u00e4ker", "JensKroll"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.014266"}
{"title": "Utility of diagnostic ultrasound in evaluating fracture healing.", "abstract": "With increase in population, modes of transportation and a fast pace of life, an individual's chances of accident and thereby chances of getting fractured have increased significantly. Fracture has thus become a significant factor contributing to morbidity and mortality. To resume a normal life, after one suffers from a fracture is also an ordeal. The transition appears smooth if the fracture healing goes on in a smooth manner as is expected through its routine stages of reactive phase, reparative phase and remodeling phase. But if in this chain something goes wrong or some factors are not optimum upto the mark, then the process becomes unsuccessful and the repair is either partial or directionless. It is therefore very vital to confirm whether or not the callus which bridges the fractured fragments is healthy or not. Here in lies the role of imaging as it can show the status of callus without disturbing it. What complicates the picture is that a callus might not be well demonstratable unless it mineralizes or calcifies. An imaging modality like ultrasound therefore stands out as it can show the state of callus in its different stages. This article aims at demonstrating how ultrasound- a non invasive diagnostic imaging modality can give precise information about the progress of fracture healing and thereby aid in management of fractures, so that an individual can return back to normal productive lifestyle.

{"title": "Curcumin attenuates angiogenesis in liver fibrosis and inhibits angiogenic properties of hepatic stellate cells.", "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is concomitant with sinusoidal pathological angiogenesis, which has been highlighted as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic liver disease. Our prior studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent antifibrotic activity, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The current work demonstrated that curcumin ameliorated fibrotic injury and sinusoidal angiogenesis in rat liver with fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride. Curcumin reduced the expression of a number of angiogenic markers in fibrotic liver. Experiments in vitro showed that the viability and vascularization of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and rat aortic ring angiogenesis were not impaired by curcumin. These results indicated that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that are characterized as liver-specific pericytes could be potential target cells for curcumin. Further investigations showed that curcumin inhibited VEGF expression in HSCs associated with disrupting platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGF-\u03b2R)/ERK and mTOR pathways. HSC motility and vascularization were also suppressed by curcumin associated with blocking PDGF-\u03b2R/focal adhesion kinase/RhoA cascade. Gain- or loss-of-function analyses revealed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) was required for curcumin to inhibit angiogenic properties of HSCs. We concluded that curcumin attenuated sinusoidal angiogenesis in liver fibrosis possibly by targeting HSCs via a PPAR-\u03b3 activation-dependent mechanism.

To achieve this, mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells were isolated and cocultured to form a vascularized bone analogue. Endothelial cells were found to exert osteopotentiating effects on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and reciprocal effects by the stromal cells were found to stimulate vasculogenic responses, suggesting the possible utility of this system to elicit three-way interactions between endothelial, mesenchymal, and prostate cancer cells. We further developed the use of fluorescently labeled cells which could be used to concurrently track cellular migration, proliferation, and morphometric analysis. We demonstrate the concurrent, real-time visualization of prostate cancer and endothelial cells, which may be useful for evaluation of spatiotemporal changes at a single-cell level.

{"title": "Negative feedback regulation of auxin signaling by ATHB8/ACL5-BUD2 transcription module.", "abstract": "The role of auxin as main regulator of vascular differentiation is well established, and a direct correlation between the rate of xylem differentiation and the amount of auxin reaching the (pro)cambial cells has been proposed. It has been suggested that thermospermine produced by ACAULIS5 (ACL5) and bushy and dwarf2 (BUD2) is one of the factors downstream to auxin contributing to the regulation of this process in Arabidopsis. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of the mechanism through which ACL5 modulates xylem differentiation. We show that an increased level of ACL5 slows down xylem differentiation by negatively affecting the expression of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) III and key auxin signaling genes. This mechanism involves the positive regulation of thermospermine biosynthesis by the HD-ZIP III protein Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox8 tightly controlling the expression of ACL5 and BUD2. In addition, we show that the HD-ZIP III protein REVOLUTA contributes to the increased leaf vascularization and long hypocotyl phenotype of acl5 likely by a direct regulation of auxin signaling genes such as like auxin resistant2 (LAX2) and LAX3. We propose that proper formation and differentiation of xylem depend on a balance between positive and negative feedback loops operating through HD-ZIP III genes.", "journal": "Molecular plant", "date": "2014-04-30", "authors": ["SimonaBaima", "ValentinaForte", "MarcoPossenti", "Andr\u00e9sPe\u00f1alosa", "GuidoLeoni", "SergioSalvi", "BarbaraFelici", "IdaRuberti", "GiorgioMorelli"], "doi": "10.1093/mp/ssu051"}

It consists of two allocortex laminae: the gyrus dentatus and the cornu ammonis, one rolled up inside the other, creating a bulge in the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Arterial vascularization of the hippocampus is dependent on the collateral branches of the posterior cerebral artery and the anterior choroidal artery, forming the network of superficial hippocampal arteries that in turn lead to deep intrahippocampal arteries. Venous vascularization is provided by the intrahippocampal veins, which drain into the superficial hippocampal veins.

It represents a minimal invasive approach for \u03b2 cell replacement, but long-term blood control is still largely unachievable. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lack of islet vasculature and hypoxic environment in the immediate post-transplantation period that contributes to the acute loss of islets by ischemia. Moreover, graft failures continue to occur because of immunological rejection, despite the use of potent immunosuppressive agents.

Nonclassic morphologic variants have rarely been reported. We present six challenging cases of CCPRCC with prominent (>75\u00a0%) tubular, acinar, and/or solid component and angioleiomyomatous stroma. The tumors lacked well-organized papillary architecture. All tumors had a variously thick capsule formed by a layer of bands of smooth muscle. The leiomyomatous tissue often entirely encased patches of tubular structures, or it formed only small leiomyomatous islands within the epithelial component. There was a remarkable relationship between the vascular network and the epithelial component in the sense that every single tubule or acinus was associated with a fine capillary network, with the capillaries intimately surrounding the tubular or acinar circumference. CCPRCC with variant morphology expressed carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) in cup-shaped distribution. In addition, the tumor cells stained positive for cytokeratin 34betaE12, CK7, and vimentin. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), P504s/AMACR, Melan A, and HMB45 were negative in tumor cells in all cases examined. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed the presence of a normal copy number for chromosomes 7, 17, 3q, and 3p. CCPRCC with variant morphology seems to have a favorable prognosis. In the current series, tumor stage was low at presentation, and none of the patients had local recurrence or metastatic disease.

Sixty-six articles were included and fully reviewed for data extraction of the surgical procedures and divided into the following 4 groups: pedicled flaps, free flaps, structural fat grafting, and conjoint treatment (free flaps plus lipofilling).\nThe therapeutic management of progressive hemifacial atrophy is based on the severity of the disease. Except for minor degrees of atrophy, for which lipofilling can satisfy the requirements, vascularized fatty tissue is essential for long-term contour correction.

Here, we have investigated arsenite-induced adverse effects on vascular tissues in the model organism zebrafish, Danio rerio. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to arsenite at different exposure windows and the susceptibility to vascular tissue damage was recorded at 72hours post fertilization (hpf). Intersegmental vessel sprouting and growth was most perturbed by exposure to arsenite during the 24-48hpf window, while disruption in the condensation of the caudal vein plexus was more often observed at the 48-72hpf exposure window, reflecting when these structures develop during normal embryogenesis. The vascular growth rate was decreased by arsenite exposure, and deviated from that of control embryos at around 24-26.5hpf. We further mapped changes in expression of key regulators of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vegfr1/flt1) expression was evident already at 24hpf, coinciding with the decreased vascular growth rate. At later time points, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) expression was upregulated, suggesting that arsenite affects the composition of the extracellular matrix. In total, the expression of eight key factors involved in different aspects of vascularization was significantly altered by arsenic exposure. In conclusion, our results show that arsenite is a potent vascular disruptor in the developing zebrafish embryo, a finding that calls for an evaluation of arsenite as a developmental vascular toxicant in mammalian model systems.", "journal": "Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2014-04-29", "authors": ["Catherine WMcCollum", "CharuHans", "ShishirShah", "Fatima AMerchant", "Jan-\u00c5keGustafsson", "MariaBondesson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.04.006"}

A total of 2791 synchronization protocols were carried out on 857 animals over 3\u00a0years. Of these protocols, 823 (29.5%) did not proceed beyond Day 7 (due to the absence of a vascularized CL) and 620 (22.2%) were discontinued on Day 10 (due to the absence of follicles >1.0\u00a0cm and tonic uteri); hence, 1443 (51.7%) protocols did not progress to TAI. Data were analyzed for four periods: P1, transition to spring (from breeding season to low breeding season); P2, low breeding season; P3, transition to fall (low breeding season to breeding season); and P4, breeding season. No differences were found among the four periods in terms of the proportion of protocols that did not result in TAI. Of the 857 buffaloes, 660 (77%) conceived and delivered a calf. The average number of TAI per pregnancy was 2.1 and ranged from 1.9 to 2.3 across years. Logistic regression analysis showed that buffaloes that calved during P3 had a higher odds ratio for pregnancy (1.380; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than buffaloes that calved in other periods. Pregnancy was also influenced by the calving to service period (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.977; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the pregnancy per AI (P/AI) at successive TAI (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.480; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The pregnancy per AI at the first TAI (424/857, 49.5%) was greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than in subsequent TAI.

Indeed, the MC horizon expanded by the discovery of their unique ability to selectively release mediators depending upon the stimulus and receptors involved. Aside from degranulation and transporter usage, MC are also endowed with piecemeal degranulation, a slower process during which mediator release occurs with minor morphological changes. The broad spectrum of pro- and anti-inflammatory bioactive substances MC produce and release, their amounts and delivery pace render these cells bona fide fine-tuners of the immune response.

The authors report a new 3-stage reconstruction of the hemipelvis after Type 3 sacrectomy involving instrumented spinoiliac arthrodesis and pedicled fibula grafting in 2 patients. The anterior stage of the procedure begins with a transabdominal approach to mobilize the viscera and to free up the tumor from the vessels. The posterior divisions of internal iliac vessels, the middle sacral vessels, and the lateral sacral vessels are then ligated. An anterior vertebrectomy is done at the appropriate level, followed by an anterior osteotomy through the lateral planed surgical margin of the sacrum close to the salvaged sacroiliac joint. The second stage includes a major sacral resection with lower-extremity amputation from the pubic symphysis through the intact side of the sacrum, ipsilateral pedicled fibula harvesting, and closure with an ipsilateral pedicled quadriceps flap. The final stage involves reconstruction with lumboiliac instrumentation. The pedicled fibular graft left from the second stage is then placed distally within the previously created iliopectineal docking site and proximally within the L-5 docking site.

She complained of a foreign body sensation, dryness, burning, and persistent uncontrolled blinking. A raised lesion was observed on the nasal conjunctiva that was 1.5 mm in size. It extended slightly onto the nasal cornea. There was moderate vascularity of the lesion that obscured the underlying scleral vessels. Moderate conjunctival hyperemia was detected at and medial to the pterygium. The cornea, anterior chamber, and external anatomy were otherwise unremarkable. The eye was initially treated twice daily with a topical application of dipyridamole in a normal saline solution, which was later reduced to once daily.\nThere was a marked improvement in both the pterygium and the patient's symptoms. The tissue regressed from the limbal region of the cornea, had decreased in length from 1.5 to 1.0 mm, and decreased in height from approximately 1.0 to approximately 0.3 mm. Conjunctival hyperemia and vascularization resolved completely, and the underlying scleral vessels could once again be visualized. At 12 months, the pterygium was graded as stage 0 to I, V0, C2, K0, P0.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case of successful management of a pterygium and associated symptoms using topical dipyridamole.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a powerful antiangiogenic factor that is secreted by adipocytes, elevated in obesity, and implicated in the development of insulin resistance. We explored the angiogenic and metabolic role of adipose-derived PEDF through in vivo studies of mice with overexpression of PEDF in adipocytes (PEDF-aP2). PEDF expression in white adipocytes and PEDF secretion from adipose tissue was increased in transgenic mice, but circulating levels of PEDF were not increased. Overexpression of PEDF did not alter vascularization, the partial pressure of O2, cellular hypoxia, or gene expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue. Energy expenditure and metabolic substrate utilization, body mass, and adiposity were not altered in PEDF-aP2 mice. Whole body glycemic control was normal as assessed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and adipocyte-specific glucose uptake was unaffected by PEDF overexpression. Adipocyte lipolysis was increased in PEDF-aP2 mice and associated with increased adipose triglyceride lipase and decreased perilipin 1 expression. Experiments conducted in mice rendered obese by high-fat feeding showed no differences between PEDF-aP2 and wild-type mice for body mass, adiposity, whole body energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, or adipose tissue oxygenation. Together, these data indicate that adipocyte-generated PEDF enhances lipolysis but question the role of PEDF as a major antiangiogenic or proinflammatory mediator in adipose tissue in vivo.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

However, so far it still remains a big challenge to identify the fine structures of the smallest capillary vessel networks via conventional imaging ways. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography was proposed for the first time to generate mega contrast X-ray images for multiscale vasculature mapping. Particularly, gallium was adopted as the room temperature liquid metal contrast agent and infused into the vessels of in vitro pig hearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the angiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent--the iohexol. As quantitatively demonstrated by the grayscale histograms and numerical indexes, the contrast of the vessels to the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than that of the iohexol enhanced images. And the angiogram has reached detailed enough width of 0.1 mm for the tiny vessels, which indicated that the capillaries can be clearly distinguished under the liquid metal enhanced images. Further, with tomography from the micro-CT, we also managed to reconstruct the 3-D structures of the kidney vessels. Tremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches have been experimentally clarified. It was disclosed that the usually invisible capillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms. This basic mechanism has generalized purpose and can be extended to a wide spectrum of 3-D computational tomographic areas.

Transcription factor Sox17 is specifically expressed in endothelial cells, but its expression and role at the vascular front remain largely unknown.\nTo specify the role of Sox17 and its relationship with the Notch pathway in sprouting angiogenesis.\nEndothelial-specific Sox17 deletion reduces sprouting angiogenesis in mouse embryonic and postnatal vascular development, whereas Sox17 overexpression increases it. Sox17 promotes endothelial migration by destabilizing endothelial junctions and rearranging cytoskeletal structure and upregulates expression of several genes preferentially expressed in tip cells. Interestingly, Sox17 expression is suppressed in stalk cells in which Notch signaling is relatively high. Notch activation by overexpressing Notch intracellular domain reduces Sox17 expression both in primary endothelial cells and in retinal angiogenesis, whereas Notch inhibition by delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) blockade increases it. The Notch pathway regulates Sox17 expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Furthermore, endothelial Sox17 ablation rescues vascular network from excessive tip cell formation and hyperbranching under Notch inhibition in developmental and tumor angiogenesis.\nOur findings demonstrate that the Notch pathway restricts sprouting angiogenesis by reducing the expression of proangiogenic regulator Sox17.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2014-04-24", "authors": ["Seung-HunLee", "SungsuLee", "HanseulYang", "SukhyunSong", "KangsanKim", "Thomas LSaunders", "Jeong KYoon", "Gou YoungKoh", "InjuneKim"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303142"}

{"title": "The effect of interstitial pressure on therapeutic agent transport: coupling with the tumor blood and lymphatic vascular systems.", "abstract": "Vascularized tumor growth is characterized by both abnormal interstitial fluid flow and the associated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). Here, we study the effect that these conditions have on the transport of therapeutic agents during chemotherapy. We apply our recently developed vascular tumor growth model which couples a continuous growth component with a discrete angiogenesis model to show that hypertensive IFP is a physical barrier that may hinder vascular extravasation of agents through transvascular fluid flux convection, which drives the agents away from the tumor. This result is consistent with previous work using simpler models without blood flow or lymphatic drainage. We consider the vascular/interstitial/lymphatic fluid dynamics to show that tumors with larger lymphatic resistance increase the agent concentration more rapidly while also experiencing faster washout. In contrast, tumors with smaller lymphatic resistance accumulate less agents but are able to retain them for a longer time. The agent availability (area-under-the curve, or AUC) increases for less permeable agents as lymphatic resistance increases, and correspondingly decreases for more permeable agents. We also investigate the effect of vascular pathologies on agent transport. We show that elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity contributes to the highest AUC when the agent is less permeable, but to lower AUC when the agent is more permeable. We find that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity contributes to low AUC in general regardless of the transvascular agent transport capability. We also couple the agent transport with the tumor dynamics to simulate chemotherapy with the same vascularized tumor under different vascular pathologies. We show that tumors with an elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity alone require the strongest dosage to shrink. We further show that tumors with elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity are more hypoxic during therapy and that the response slows down as the tumor shrinks due to the heterogeneity and low concentration of agents in the tumor interior compared with the cases where other pathological effects may combine to flatten the IFP and thus reduce the heterogeneity. We conclude that dual normalizations of the micronevironment - both the vasculature and the interstitium - are needed to maximize the effects of chemotherapy, while normalization of only one of these may be insufficient to overcome the physical resistance and may thus lead to sub-optimal outcomes.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2014-04-23", "authors": ["MinWu", "Hermann BFrieboes", "Mark A JChaplain", "Steven RMcDougall", "VittorioCristini", "John SLowengrub"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.04.012"}

In this model, IMQ strongly inhibited melanoma tumor development through prompt mobilization of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and by triggering their cytotoxic functions, and through upregulation of expression of type 1 IFN response genes.

The pre-vascularized inner layer was formed by seeding human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on a cell sheet comprised of a layer of undifferentiated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The outer osteogenic layer was formed by inducing osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In vitro results indicated that the undifferentiated hMSC cell sheet facilitated the alignment of HUVECs and significantly promoted the formation of vascular-like networks. Furthermore, seeded HUVECs rearranged the extracellular matrix produced by hMSC sheet. After subcutaneous implantation, the composite constructs showed rapid vascularization and anastomosis with the host vascular system, forming functional blood vessels in vivo. Osteogenic potential of the BIM was evidenced by immunohistochemistry staining of osteocalcin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and alizarin red staining.

However, while the current regenerative approaches focus on the use of dental stem cells (DSCs), little is known about these cells and their ability to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the paracrine angiogenic properties of postnatal DSCs, in particular dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) and dental follicle precursor cells (FSCs). An antibody array, together with RT-PCR and ELISA, pointed out the differential expression of pro-angiogenic as well as anti-angiogenic factors by cultured DSCs and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). Despite the secretion of proliferation-promoting factors, DSCs caused no notable increase in the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). With regard to other aspects of the angiogenic cascade, DPSCs, SCAPs and HGF-1 significantly promoted endothelial migration in a transwell migration assay. DPSCs also had a pronounced effect on endothelial tubulogenesis, as was shown by an in vitro Matrigel\u2122 assay.

{"title": "PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2 mediate endothelial cell differentiation capability of triple negative breast carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subgroup of breast carcinoma, still lacking specific markers for an effective targeted therapy and with a poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. In this study we investigated the possibility that TNBC cells contribute to the establishment of tumor vascular network by the process known as vasculogenic mimicry, through endothelial cell differentiation. Vascular-like functional properties of breast cancer cell lines were investigated in vitro by tube formation assay and in vivo by confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry on frozen tumor sections. TNBCs express endothelial markers and acquire the ability to form vascular-like channels in vitro and in vivo, both in xenograft models and in human specimens, generating blood lacunae surrounded by tumor cells. Notably this feature is significantly associated with reduced disease free survival. The impairment of the main pathways involved in vessel formation, by treatment with inhibitors (i.e. Sunitinib and Bevacizumab) or by siRNA-mediating silencing, allowed the identification of PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2 as relevant players in this phenomenon. Inhibition of these tyrosine kinase receptors negatively affects vascular lacunae formation and significantly inhibits TNBC growth in vivo. In summary, we demonstrated that TNBCs have the ability to form vascular-like channels in vitro and to generate blood lacunae lined by tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, this feature is associated with poor outcome, probably contributing to the aggressiveness of this breast cancer subgroup. Finally, PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2-mediated pathways, identified as relevant in mediating this characteristic, potentially represent valid targets for a specific therapy of this breast cancer subgroup.", "journal": "Molecular oncology", "date": "2014-04-22", "authors": ["IlariaPlantamura", "PatriziaCasalini", "EricaDugnani", "MariannaSasso", "ElviraD'Ippolito", "MonicaTortoreto", "MatildeCacciatore", "CarlaGuarnotta", "CristinaGhirelli", "IsabellaBarajon", "FrancescaBianchi", "TizianaTriulzi", "RobertoAgresti", "AndreaBalsari", "ManuelaCampiglio", "ClaudioTripodo", "Marilena VIorio", "EldaTagliabue"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molonc.2014.03.015"}
{"title": "The effect of thick fibers and large pores of electrospun poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) vascular grafts on macrophage polarization and arterial regeneration.", "abstract": "The vascular grafts prepared by electrospinning often have relatively small pores, which limit cell infiltration into the grafts and hinder the regeneration and remodeling of the grafts into neoarteries. To overcome this problem, macroporous electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with thicker fibers (5-6\u00a0\u03bcm) and larger pores (\u223c30\u00a0\u03bcm) were fabricated in the present study. In\u00a0vitro cell culture indicated that macrophages cultured on thicker-fiber scaffolds tended to polarize into the immunomodulatory and tissue remodeling (M2) phenotype, while those cultured on thinner-fiber scaffolds expressed proinflammatory (M1) phenotype. In\u00a0vivo implantation by replacing rat abdominal aorta was performed and followed up for 7, 14, 28 and 100\u00a0d. The results demonstrated that the macroporous grafts markedly enhanced cell infiltration and extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion. All grafts showed satisfactory patency for up to 100 days. At day 100, the endothelium coverage was complete, and the regenerated smooth muscle layer was correctly organized with abundant ECM similar to those in the native arteries. More importantly, the regenerated arteries demonstrated contractile response to adrenaline and acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Analysis of the cellularization process revealed that the thicker-fiber scaffolds induced a large number of M2 macrophages to infiltrate into the graft wall. These macrophages further promoted cellular infiltration and vascularization. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that the scaffold structure can regulate macrophage phenotype. Our thicker-fiber electrospun PCL vascular grafts could enhance the vascular regeneration and remodeling process by mediating macrophage polarization into M2 phenotype, suggesting that our constructs may be a promising cell-free vascular graft candidate and are worthy for further in\u00a0vivo evaluation.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-04-22", "authors": ["ZhihongWang", "YunCui", "JianingWang", "XiaohuYang", "YifanWu", "KaiWang", "XuanGao", "DongLi", "YuejieLi", "Xi-LongZheng", "YanZhu", "DelingKong", "QiangZhao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.078"}

Here we show that VEGF activates UPR mediators through a PLC\u03b3-mediated crosstalk with the mTORC1 complex without accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Activation of ATF6 and PERK contributes to the survival effect of VEGF on endothelial cells (ECs) by positively regulating mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473, which is required for full activity of AKT. Low levels of CHOP allow ECs to evade the proapoptotic effect of this UPR product. Depletion of PLC\u03b3, ATF6, or eIF2\u03b1 dramatically inhibited VEGF-induced vascularization in mouse Matrigel plugs, suggesting that the ER and the UPR machinery constitute components of the VEGF signaling circuit that regulates EC survival and angiogenesis, extending their role beyond adaptation to ER stress.", "journal": "Molecular cell", "date": "2014-04-22", "authors": ["EvdoxiaKarali", "SofiaBellou", "DimitrisStellas", "ApostolosKlinakis", "CarolMurphy", "TheodoreFotsis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.022"}

{"title": "Hypothalamic subependymal niche: a novel site of the adult neurogenesis.", "abstract": "The discovery of undifferentiated, actively proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) in the mature brain opened a brand new chapter in the contemporary neuroscience. Adult neurogenesis appears to occur in specific brain regions (including hypothalamus) throughout vertebrates' life, being considered an important player in the processes of memory, learning, and neural plasticity. In the adult mammalian brain, NSCs are located mainly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle ependymal wall. Besides these classical regions, hypothalamic neurogenesis occurring mainly along and beneath the third ventricle wall seems to be especially well documented. Neurogenic zones in SGZ, SVZ, and in the hypothalamus share some particular common features like similar cellular cytoarchitecture, vascularization pattern, and extracellular matrix properties. Hypothalamic neurogenic niche is formed mainly by four special types of radial glia-like tanycytes. They are characterized by distinct expression of some neural progenitor and stem cell markers. Moreover, there are numerous suggestions that newborn hypothalamic neurons have a significant ability to integrate into the local neural pathways and to play important physiological roles, especially in the energy balance regulation. Newly formed neurons in the hypothalamus can synthesize and release food intake regulating neuropeptides and they are sensitive to the leptin. On the other hand, high-fat diet positively influences hypothalamic neurogenesis in rodents. The nature of this intriguing new site of adult neurogenesis is still so far poorly studied and requires further investigations.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "date": "2014-04-20", "authors": ["EwaRojczyk-Go\u0142\u0119biewska", "ArturPa\u0142asz", "RyszardWiaderkiewicz"], "doi": "10.1007/s10571-014-0058-5"}
{"title": "The role of pericytes in neurovascular unit remodeling in brain disorders.", "abstract": "Neurons are extremely vulnerable cells that tightly rely on the brain's highly dynamic and complex vascular network that assures an accurate and adequate distribution of nutrients and oxygen. The neurovascular unit (NVU) couples neuronal activity to vascular function, controls brain homeostasis, and maintains an optimal brain microenvironment adequate for neuronal survival by adjusting blood-brain barrier (BBB) parameters based on brain needs. The NVU is a heterogeneous structure constituted by different cell types that includes pericytes. Pericytes are localized at the abluminal side of brain microvessels and contribute to NVU function. Pericytes play essential roles in the development and maturation of the neurovascular system during embryogenesis and stability during adulthood. Initially, pericytes were described as contractile cells involved in controlling neurovascular tone. However, recent reports have shown that pericytes dynamically respond to stress induced by injury upon brain diseases, by chemically and physically communicating with neighboring cells, by their immune properties and by their potential pluripotent nature within the neurovascular niche. As such, in this paper, we would like to review the role of pericytes in NVU remodeling, and their potential as targets for NVU repair strategies and consequently neuroprotection in two pathophysiologically distinct brain disorders: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD).", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2014-04-20", "authors": ["AymanElAli", "PeterTh\u00e9riault", "SergeRivest"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms15046453\n10.1126/scisignal.2002886\n10.1126/scisignal.2001213\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005066\n10.1038/ncomms3932"}

We had previously found that porcine allograft hemimandibles filled with autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2-soaked absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS) were completely replaced by vascularized bone, provided the construct had been incubated within a periosteal envelope. The present study sought to deepen our understanding of allograft revitalization by investigating the individual contributions of ASCs and rhBMP-2 in the process and the mechanical properties of the revitalized allograft.\nPorcine allograft hemimandible constructs were implanted bilaterally into rib periosteal envelopes in 8 pigs. To examine the contributions of ASCs and rhBMP-2, the following groups were assessed: group 1, periosteum alone; group 2, periosteum+ASCs; group 3, periosteum+rhBMP-2/ACS; and group 4, periosteum+ASCs+rhBMP-2/ACS. After 8 weeks, the allograft constructs were harvested for micro-computed tomography (CT) and histologic analyses and 3-point bending to assess the strength.\nOn harvesting, the constructs receiving rhBMP-2/ACS had significantly greater bone shown by micro-CT than those receiving periosteum only (51,463 vs. 34,310 mm3; P = .031). The constructs receiving ASCs had increased bone compared to group 1 (periosteum only), although not significantly (P = .087). The combination of rhBMP-2/ACS with ASCs produced bone (50,399 mm3) equivalent to that of the constructs containing rhBMP-2/ACS only. The 3-point bending tests showed no differences between the 4 groups and a nonimplanted allograft or native mandible (P = .586), suggesting the absence of decreased strength of the allograft bone when revitalized.\nThese data have shown that rhBMP-2/ACS significantly stimulates new bone formation by way of allograft revitalization and that the revitalized allograft has equivalent mechanical strength to native bone.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2014-04-20", "authors": ["Christopher MRunyan", "Samantha TAli", "WendyChen", "Bennet WCalder", "Aaron ERumburg", "David ABillmire", "Jesse ATaylor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2014.01.017"}

SVF cells are ideal seed cells. Both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and SVF cells can promote neovascularization. However, the half-life (about 50 min) of VEGF is too short to sustain an adequate local concentration. We have investigated whether VEGF-polylactic acid (PLA) nano-sustained release microspheres plus SVF cells can improve neovascularization and survival of transplanted fat tissues. SVF cells were harvested and constructed VEGF-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres in vitro. Human fat tissues was mixed with SVF cells plus VEGF-PLA, SVF cells alone or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as the control. These three mixtures were injected into random sites in 18 nude mice. Two months later, the transplants were weighed and examined histologically; and capillaries were counted to quantify neovascularization. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and anti-VEGF stains were applied to reveal cell infiltration.

More vessels were present in the SVF plus VEGF-PLA transplants than in the other two types. Transplants mixed with SVF cells also had an acceptable density of capillaries. Histological analysis revealed that both the SVF plus VEGF-PLA and SVF alone transplants, but not the control transplants, were composed of adipose tissue, and had less fat necrosis and less fibrosis than control specimens. SVF plus VEGF-PLA transplants had significantly greater capillary density and VEGF expression than the other two transplant groups.

Cost and patient exposure to the challenges of lifelong immunosuppression for what is a quality of life-improving (but not life-saving) operation are the focus of the ongoing discussion. A study performed in 2007 showed that surgeons' opinions on the issue varied widely. Recently, more information has been made available regarding long-term patient outcomes, and significant improvements in immunotherapy protocols have been reported. In light of this, we sought to examine changing attitudes regarding hand allotransplantation and its indications by surveying hand surgeons.\nAn email-based survey was sent to members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. Demographic information and practice profiles were identified, followed by their risk assessment of hand allotransplants and endorsement of performing the operation in different clinical scenarios. Additional questions focused on the appropriate indications for hand allotransplantation, as well as the procedure's associated ethical and financial implications.\nA total of 385 surgeons responded to the survey (14% response rate). The majority (82%) considered hand transplantation to be a high-risk operation (as opposed to 27% in hand replantation), with 78% citing lifelong immunosuppression as the primary factor impacting their overall risk assessment. The most commonly accepted indication for hand vascularized composite allotransplantation was loss of bilateral hands (80% in favor). Dominant hand loss (with an intact contralateral hand) was a far less frequently accepted indication (36% in favor). Patient adherence to immunosuppressive regimens (51%) and expectations of functional/aesthetic outcome (38%) were the most frequently chosen top psychosocial issues that must be addressed by the surgical/medical teams involved in the operation.\nOur study's results demonstrate increasing overall support for hand allotransplantation and increasing acceptance of today's immunosuppressive regimens compared to prior literature. Bilateral hand loss remains the primary agreed-upon indication for transplantation.

When hESC-CMs were challenged with an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, mimicking cell transplantation into an ischemic site, survival was significantly greater among cells pretreated with CoPP versus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-pretreated controls. Compared with PBS-pretreated cells, CoPP-pretreated hESC-CM preparations exhibited higher levels of HO-1 expression, Akt phosphorylation, and vascular endothelial growth factor production, with reduced apoptosis, and a 30% decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species. For in vivo translation, 1 \u00d7 10(7) hESC-CMs were pretreated ex vivo with CoPP or PBS and then injected intramyocardially into rat hearts immediately following acute infarction (permanent coronary ligation). At 1 week, hESC-CM content, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for human Alu sequences, was 17-fold higher in hearts receiving CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells. On histomorphometry, cardiomyocyte graft size was 2.6-fold larger in hearts receiving CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells, occupying up to 12% of the ventricular area. Vascular density of host-perfused human-derived capillaries was significantly greater in grafts composed of CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells.

For large segmental jawbone defects, it is difficult to form the functional vascular networks within the graft due to limited diffusion of nutrition and uneven distribution of seed cells. From the standpoint of bionics, seed cells should be continuously transmitted into the graft to replace the necrotic cells during the entire process of bones regeneration. However, the existing one-time inoculation method (OIM) fails to achieve this goal because it is almost impossible to re-open the wound and inoculate cells into grafts that have already been implanted into the body. Inspired by the anatomical structure of jawbones, we hypothesize that the root canal in teeth of jawbones could be used as a channel through which seed cells could be delivered into the graft. Therefore, the multiple-times inoculation method (MIM) could be achieved via the root canal system if defects are located on the maxillofacial bones with teeth.

Implantation of synthetic mesh might damage vaginal innervation and vascularization, which could cause sexual dysfunction.\nWe aim to evaluate the effects of vaginal mesh surgery on vaginal vasocongestion and vaginal wall sensibility in patients with recurrent POP.\nA prospective study was performed among patients with previous native tissue repair, scheduled for vaginal mesh surgery. Measurements were performed before and 6 months after surgery, during nonerotic and erotic visual stimuli, using a validated vaginal combi-probe.\nThe combi-probe involves vaginal photoplethysmography to assess Vaginal Pulse Amplitude (VPA) (representing vaginal vasocongestion) and four pulse-generating electrodes to measure vaginal wall sensibility (representing vaginal innervation). Sexual function was assessed using validated questionnaires (Female Sexual Function Index, Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised, and Subjective sexual arousal and affect questionnaire).\nSixteen women were included, 14 completed the 6-month follow-up visit. Vaginal vasocongestion under erotic conditions did not significantly alter after mesh implantation. Vaginal wall sensibility of the distal posterior wall was significantly increased after mesh surgery (preoperative threshold 6.3\u2009mA vs. postoperative 3.4\u2009mA, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Sexual function as assessed with questionnaires was not significantly affected.\nIn women with a history of vaginal prolapse surgery, vaginal mesh surgery did not decrease vaginal vasocongestion or vaginal wall sensibility. Vaginal vasocongestion prior to mesh surgery appeared to be lower than that of women never operated on. Apparently, native tissue repair decreased preoperative vaginal vasocongestion levels to such extent that subsequent mesh surgery had no additional detrimental effect. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously.

{"title": "Cell infiltration and vascularization in porous nanoyarn scaffolds prepared by dynamic liquid electrospinning.", "abstract": "A novel electrospun nanoyarn scaffold, aimed to improve cell infiltration and vascularization, as well as guide cell behaviors by its biomimetic structure, was fabricated for tissue engineering. Electrospun nanofibers were deposited and twisted into yarns in a water vortex before collecting on a rotating mandrel to form a nanoyarn scaffold. Field emission-scanning electronic microscope (FE-SEM) images revealed that the scaffold, composed of aligned nanoyarns (24 micro m) which were composed of a bundle of nanofibers, created a porous structure which may be conducive to cellular infiltration. Thus, we hypothesized that the biomimetic nanoyarn will have a positive influence on cell proliferation and morphology. Pig iliac endothelial cells (PIECs) and MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells cultured on the nanoyarn scaffolds showed significantly higher proliferation rates than that on traditional electrospun nanofiber scaffolds. Histological analysis demonstrated that cells infiltrate throughout the nanoyarn scaffolds over a 10-day period, however, no cell infiltration was observed on the nanofiber scaffolds. Moreover, confocal microscopy images indicated that both PIECs and MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells cultured on the nanoyarn scaffolds exhibit an extremely elongated morphology compared to the flattened morphology when cells were cultured on electrospun nanofiber scaffolds or tissue culture plates. Furthermore, complex capillary-like structures were observed when PIECs cultured on the nanoyarn scaffold for 7 days, indicating that the nanoyarns provide templates and topographical cues for the assembly of PIECs and the promotion of a capillary network in vitro. In conclusion, the positive cellular interactions on the nanoyarn scaffold demonstrate potential application for use in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical nanotechnology", "date": "2014-04-17", "authors": ["JingleiWu", "ChenHuang", "WeiLiu", "AnlinYin", "WeimingChen", "ChuanglongHe", "HongshengWang", "ShenLiu", "CunyiFan", "Gary LBowlin", "XiumeiMo"], "doi": "10.1166/jbn.2014.1733"}

Simvastatin has been used for long as a common lipid lowering agent which was reported to have some pleiotropic effects such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation and immunomodulation. In this study we aimed to determine the effect of simvastatin on wound healing process in laboratory rats by means of stereological and histopathological analyses. 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (220 \u00b1 20 g) with a 1 cm(2) circular full-thickness wound on their back were divided into three groups: SS group that received a gel with 2% concentration of simvastatin; UW group that received no treatment but daily irrigation with normal saline; Base group that was treated with the gel base. Duration of the study was 12 days and at the end, wound closure rate, grade of inflammation, granulation-tissue formation, ulceration, epithelization, fibroblast proliferation, collagen-bundles synthesis, and vascularization were determined. Outcome of this study revealed that Simvastatin improves the wound healing by its anti-inflammatory and epithelization induction effect as well as statistically significant induction of fibroblast proliferation and collagen bundle synthesis which were reported by our stereological and histopathological investigations.

Accordingly, we investigated the antiangiogenic efficacy and associated mechanisms of cucurbitacin-I in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cucurbitacin-I inhibited HUVEC proliferation, invasion, migration and tubule formation, as well as angiogenic activity by rat aorta explants. Notably, cucurbitacin-I inhibited phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, which are key regulators of endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. In vivo matrigel plug assay in mice showed significant decrease in vascularization and hemoglobin content in the plugs from cucurbitacin-I-treated mice, compared with control mice. Overall, these results suggest that cucurbitacin-I inhibits various attributes of angiogenesis, which might contribute to its reported antitumor effects.

The features of greatest sensitivity on ultrasonography were intraplacental lacunae and loss of the normal retroplacental clear space. Increased vascularization in the uterine serosa-bladder wall interface and vascularization perpendicular to the uterine wall had the best positive predictive value (92%). At MRI, uterine bulging had the best positive predictive value (85%) and its combination with the presence of dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted images improved the predictive value to 90%.\nUltrasound imaging is the mainstay of screening for placenta accreta.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to neoangiogenesis and to the revascularization process during ischaemic events and play a key role in the response to pancreatic islet injury. In this work we co-transplanted EPCs and islets in the portal vein of chemically-induced diabetic rats to restore islet vascularization and to improve graft survival. Syngenic islets were transplanted, either alone or with EPCs derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic rats, into the portal vein of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Blood glucose levels were monitored and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed. Real time-PCR was carried out to evaluate the gene expression of angiogenic factors. Diabetic-induced rats showed long-lasting (6 months) normoglycemia upon co-transplantation of syngenic islets and EPCs. After 3-5 days from transplantation, hyperglycaemic levels dropped to normal values and lasted unmodified as long as they were checked. Further, glucose tolerance tests revealed the animals' ability to produce insulin on-demand as indexed by a prompt response in blood glucose clearance. Graft neovascularization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry: for the first time the measure of endothelial thickness revealed a donor-EPC-related neovascularization supporting viable islets up to six months after transplant. Our results highlight the importance of a newly formed viable vascular network together with pancreatic islets to provide de novo adequate supply in order to obtain enduring normoglycemia and prevent diabetes-related long-term health hazards.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-04-16", "authors": ["PaolaQuaranta", "SaraAntonini", "SaturninoSpiga", "BenedettaMazzanti", "MicheleCurcio", "GiovannaMulas", "MarcoDiana", "PasquinaMarzola", "FrancoMosca", "BiancamariaLongoni"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094783\n10.4161/isl.1.1.9054"}

The elements of different types are coupled via mechanical mapping encoded in the global stiffness matrix.

Chitosan was grafted with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to biofunctionalize the CPC. HUVEC and HOB were cocultured on macroporous CPC-RGD and CPC control without RGD for up to 42d. The osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation, bone matrix mineral synthesis, and formation of microcapillary-like structures were measured.\nRGD-grafting in CPC increased the gene expressions of osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation markers than those of CPC control without RGD. Cell-synthesized bone mineral content also increased on CPC-RGD, compared to CPC control (p<0.05). Immunostaining with endothelial marker showed that the amount of microcapillary-like structures on CPC scaffolds increased with time. At 42d, the cumulative vessel length for CPC-RGD scaffold was 1.69-fold that of CPC control. SEM examination confirmed the morphology of self-assembled microcapillary-like structures on CPC scaffolds.\nHUVEC+HOB coculture on macroporous CPC scaffold successfully achieved prevascularization.

{"title": "Human adipose tissue-resident monocytes exhibit an endothelial-like phenotype and display angiogenic properties.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue has the unique property of expanding throughout adult life, and angiogenesis is required for its growth. However, endothelial progenitor cells contribute minimally to neovascularization. Because myeloid cells have proven to be angiogenic, and monocytes accumulate in expanding adipose tissue, they might contribute to vascularization.\nThe stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from human adipose tissue were magnetically separated according to CD45 or CD14 expression. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were obtained from SVF CD45- cells. CD14+ monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells and then cultured with SVF-derived MSCs. Freshly isolated or cultured cells were characterized with flow cytometry; the conditioned media were analyzed for the angiogenic growth factors, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with Luminex Technology; their angiogenic capacity was determined in an in vivo gelatinous protein mixture (Matrigel) plug angiogenesis assay.\nCD45+ hematopoietic cells within the SVF contain CD14+ cells that co-express the CD34 progenitor marker and the endothelial cell antigens VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR), VEGFR1/Flt1, and Tie2. Co-culture experiments showed that SVF-derived MSCs promoted the acquisition of KDR and Tie-2 in PB monocytes. MSCs secreted significant amounts of Ang-2 and HGF, but minimal amounts of bFGF, G-CSF, or GM-CSF, whereas the opposite was observed for SVF CD14+ cells. Additionally, SVF CD14+ cells secreted significantly higher levels of VEGF and bFGF than did MSCs. Culture supernatants of PB monocytes cultured with MSCs contained significantly higher concentrations of VEGF, HGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF than did the supernatants from cultures without MSCs. Quantitative analysis of angiogenesis at 14 days after implantation demonstrated that neovascularization of the implants containing SVF CD14+ cells or PB monocytes previously co-cultured with MSCs was 3.5 or 2 times higher than that observed in the implants with SVF-derived MSCs. Moreover, immunofluorescence of Matrigel sections revealed that SVF CD14+ cells differentiated into endothelial cells and contributed to vascular endothelium.\nThe results from this study suggest that adipose tissue-resident monocytes should contribute to tissue vascularization.

The \u03b2 subunits are multifunctional channel modulators and are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). \u03b21, encoded by SCN1B, is best characterized in the central nervous system (CNS), where it plays a critical role in regulating electrical excitability, neurite outgrowth and migration during development. \u03b21 is also expressed in breast cancer (BCa) cell lines, where it regulates adhesion and migration in vitro. In the present study, we found that SCN1B mRNA/\u03b21 protein were up-regulated in BCa specimens, compared with normal breast tissue. \u03b21 upregulation substantially increased tumour growth and metastasis in a xenograft model of BCa. \u03b21 over-expression also increased vascularization and reduced apoptosis in the primary tumours, and \u03b21 over-expressing tumour cells had an elongate morphology. In vitro, \u03b21 potentiated outgrowth of processes from BCa cells co-cultured with fibroblasts, via trans-homophilic adhesion. \u03b21-mediated process outgrowth in BCa cells required the presence and activity of fyn kinase, and Na(+) current, thus replicating the mechanism by which \u03b21 regulates neurite outgrowth in CNS neurons. We conclude that when present in breast tumours, \u03b21 enhances pathological growth and cellular dissemination. This study is the first demonstration of a functional role for \u03b21 in tumour growth and metastasis in vivo.

The use of biomaterials as an alternative of skin replacement has become relevant, but its use is still limited due to poor vascularization inside the scaffolds, resulting in insufficient oxygen and growth factors at the wound site. In this study, we have developed a cell-based wound therapy consisting of the application of collagen-based dermal scaffolds containing mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSC) in an immunocompetent mouse model of angiogenesis. From our comparative study on the secretion profile between WJ-MSC and adipose tissue-derived MSC, we found a stronger expression of several well-characterized growth factors, such as VEGF-A, angiopoietin-1 and aFGF, which are directly linked to angiogenesis, in the culture supernatant of WJ-MSC, both on monolayer and 3D culture conditions. WJ-MSC proved to be angiogenic both in vitro and in vivo, through tubule formation and CAM assays, respectively. Moreover, WJ-MSC consistently improved the healing response in vivo in a mouse model of human-like dermal repair, by triggering angiogenesis and further providing a suitable matrix for wound repair, without altering the inflammatory response in the animals.

Because of its rarity, the literature regarding this tumor remains limited and a detailed immunophenotype of this tumor has not been established as yet. We report a clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of 42 patients with invasive carcinoma NST with OGCs. Macroscopically, these tumors presented as a well-delimited red-brown mass. A remarkable feature of the tumor was the presence of OGCs in the fibroblastic or hemorrhagic vascular stroma, as well as in the adjacent tumor nests or glandular lumina. The number of OGCs varied from 8 to 105 per 10 high-power fields with an average of 48. The tumors were well to moderately differentiated.

{"title": "Prolonged presence of VEGF promotes vascularization in 3D bioprinted scaffolds with defined architecture.", "abstract": "Timely vascularization is essential for optimal performance of bone regenerative constructs. Vascularization is efficiently stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance with a short half-life time. This study investigates the controlled release of VEGF from gelatin microparticles (GMPs) as a means to prolong VEGF activity at the preferred location within 3D bioprinted scaffolds, and the effects on subsequent vascularization. The release of VEGF from GMPs was continuous for 3 weeks during in vitro studies, and bioactivity was confirmed using human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in migration assays. Traditional and real-time migration assays showed immediate and efficient EPC migration in the presence of GMP-released VEGF, indistinguishable from VEGF-solution that was added to the medium. Matrigel scaffolds containing EPCs and VEGF, which was released either in a fast or sustained fashion by application of GMPs, were investigated for their in vivo vasculogenic capacity. Implantation in subcutaneous pockets in nude mice for one week demonstrated that vessel formation was significantly higher in the VEGF sustained-release group compared to the fast release group. In addition, regional differences with respect to VEGF release were introduced in 3D bioprinted EPC-laden scaffolds and their influence on vasculogenesis was investigated in vivo. The different regions were retained and vessel formation occurred analogous with the results seen in the Matrigel plugs. We conclude that GMPs are suitable to generate sustained release profiles of bioactive VEGF, and that they can be used to create defined differentiation regions in 3D bioprinted heterogeneous constructs, allowing a new generation of smart scaffold design.

In the present study the different effects of silver acetate-coating and vaporized metallic silver-coating on the vascularization and perigraft inflammation during the initial phase after implantation of Intergard Silver (IS) and Silver Graft (SG) were compared.\nSilver acetate-coated IS and vaporized metallic silver-coated SG were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per group) to study angiogenesis and leukocyte inflammation at the implantation site by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy over a 14-day period. At the end of the in vivo experiments, apoptosis and cell proliferation in the newly developed granulation tissue surrounding the implants was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.\nIS exhibited an improved vascularization, resulting in a significantly higher functional capillary density when compared to SG. Moreover, the leukocyte inflammatory response to IS was less pronounced, as indicated by a reduced number of adherent leukocytes in perigraft venules. This was associated with a higher proliferative activity of the granulation tissue incorporating the IS when compared to SG. The numbers of apoptotic cells in the perigraft tissue were low and did not differ between the two groups.\nSilver acetate-coated IS exhibits an improved vascularization and reduced perigraft inflammation during the first 14 days after implantation when compared to vaporized metallic silver-coated SG.

Systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, have been investigated for a long time for the treatment of various lung diseases. The pulmonary route, owing to a noninvasive method of drug administration, for both local and systemic delivery of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) forms an ideal environment for APIs acting on pulmonary diseases and disorders. Additionally, this route offers many advantages, such as a high surface area with rapid absorption due to high vascularization and circumvention of the first pass effect. Aerosolization or inhalation of colloidal systems is currently being extensively studied and has huge potential for targeted drug delivery in the treatment of various diseases. Furthermore, the surfactant-associated proteins present at the interface enhance the effect of these formulations by decreasing the surface tension and allowing the maximum effect.

{"title": "Evaluation of computer-assisted mandibular reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest bone graft compared to conventional surgery: a randomized prospective clinical trial.", "abstract": "Computer-assisted surgery plays an increasingly important role in mandibular reconstruction, ensuring the best possible masticatory function and aesthetic outcome.\nTwenty patients were randomly assigned to computer-assisted or conventional mandibular reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest bone graft in a prospective study design.Virtual surgical planning was based on preoperative CT-data using specific surgical planning software. A rapid prototyping guide transferred the virtual surgery plan to the operation site. During surgery the transplant ischemic time, reconstruction time, time for shaping the transplant and amount of bone removed were measured. Additionally, the difference in the intercondylar distance before and after surgery was calculated.\nComputer-assisted surgery shortened the time of transplant ischemia (P\u2009<\u20090.005) and defect reconstruction (P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to conventional surgery. The time to saw and shape the transplant at the donor site was shorter using conventional surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.005); therefore, the overall time for surgery didn't change (P\u2009=\u20090.527). In the computer-assisted group, the amount of bone harvested equaled the defect size, whereas the transplant size in the conventional group exceeded the defect site by 16.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u00a0mm (P\u2009<\u20090.001) on average. The intercondylar distance before compared to after surgery was less affected in the computer-assisted than in the conventional group (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThe presented study shows that computer-assisted surgery can help reduce the time for mandibular defect reconstruction and consequently the transplant ischemic time. In the computer-assisted group, the iliac crest donor site defect was downsized and the postoperative condyle position was less altered, reducing possible risks of postoperative complications and donor site morbidity.\nDRKS00005181.", "journal": "Trials", "date": "2014-04-11", "authors": ["NassimAyoub", "AlirezaGhassemi", "MajeedRana", "MarcusGerressen", "DieterRiediger", "FrankH\u00f6lzle", "AliModabber"], "doi": "10.1186/1745-6215-15-114\n10.1097/00006534-199910000-00011\n10.1002/1098-2388(200010/11)19:3<226::AID-SSU4>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1097/00006534-197001000-00002\n10.1097/00006534-198806000-00007\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2012.04.257\n10.1016/j.joms.2012.08.022\n10.1055/s-0028-1109204\n10.1016/j.joms.2013.06.219\n10.1007/s00266-012-9877-2\n10.1016/j.joms.2010.06.177\n10.1097/mlg.0b013e318031f0cf\n10.1097/01.prs.0000219076.83890.e8\n10.1016/j.joms.2010.07.047\n10.1097/01.prs.0000240703.02620.24\n10.1016/j.joms.2006.04.001\n10.1054/ijom.2002.0278\n10.1097/00006534-199010000-00022\n10.1016/j.joms.2005.12.072\n10.1016/j.joms.2009.04.013\n10.1007/s00784-012-0803-4\n10.1016/j.ijom.2004.03.018"}
{"title": "Endothelial cell-derived non-canonical Wnt ligands control vascular pruning in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Multiple cell types involved in the regulation of angiogenesis express Wnt ligands. Although \u03b2-catenin dependent and independent Wnt signaling pathways have been shown to control angiogenesis, the contribution of individual cell types to activate these downstream pathways in endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel formation is still elusive. To investigate the role of ECs in contributing Wnt ligands for regulation of blood vessel formation, we conditionally deleted the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO). Evi-ECKO mice showed decreased microvessel density during physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and in tumors, respectively. The reduced microvessel density resulted from increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC survival and proliferation. Concomitantly, survival-related genes were downregulated and cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-inducing genes were upregulated. EVI silencing in cultured HUVECs showed similar target gene regulation, supporting a mechanism of EC-derived Wnt ligands in controlling EC function. ECs preferentially expressed non-canonical Wnt ligands and canonical target gene expression was unaffected in Evi-ECKO mice. Furthermore, the reduced vascularization of Matrigel plugs in Evi-ECKO mice could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. Treatment of mouse pups with the non-canonical Wnt inhibitor TNP470 resulted in increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC proliferation, thus mimicking the proliferation-dependent Evi-ECKO remodeling phenotype. Taken together, this study identified EC-derived non-canonical Wnt ligands as regulators of EC survival, proliferation and subsequent vascular pruning during developmental and pathological angiogenesis.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-04-10", "authors": ["ClaudiaKorn", "BeateScholz", "JunhaoHu", "KshitijSrivastava", "JessicaWojtarowicz", "TabeaArnsperger", "Ralf HAdams", "MichaelBoutros", "Hellmut GAugustin", "IrisAugustin"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.104422"}

We present experimental in vitro and in vivo data on 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-(2-(myo-inositolyl)-ethyl)-sn-glycero-3-(R/S)-phosphatidyl-choline (Ino-C2-PAF), the lead compound of a class of synthetic glycosylated phospholipids, in anti-inflammatory therapy. Ino-C2-PAF strongly induced apoptosis only in TNF\u03b1-stimulated, but not in untreated human vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, TNF\u03b1-induced endothelial adhesion molecules that mediated the rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes (vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and ICAM-1) were selectively downregulated by Ino-C2-PAF. Similarly, expression of L-selectin, VCAM-1 receptor \u03b14\u03b21 integrin , and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced without induction of apoptosis. Functionally, these changes were accompanied by significant impairment of rolling and adhesion of human peripheral blood lymphocytes on TNF\u03b1-activated endothelial cells in a dynamic flow chamber system. When the therapeutic potential of Ino-C2-PAF was assessed in two complementary mouse models of psoriasis, K5.hTGF\u03b21 transgenic and JunB/c-Jun-deficient mice, Ino-C2-PAF led to significant alleviation of the clinical symptoms and normalized the pathological cutaneous changes including vascularization.

{"title": "Vascular rarefaction mediates whitening of brown fat in obesity.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a highly vascularized organ with abundant mitochondria that produce heat through uncoupled respiration. Obesity is associated with a reduction of BAT function; however, it is unknown how obesity promotes dysfunctional BAT. Here, using a murine model of diet-induced obesity, we determined that obesity causes capillary rarefaction and functional hypoxia in BAT, leading to a BAT \"whitening\" phenotype that is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid droplet accumulation, and decreased expression of Vegfa. Targeted deletion of Vegfa in adipose tissue of nonobese mice resulted in BAT whitening, supporting a role for decreased vascularity in obesity-associated BAT. Conversely, introduction of VEGF-A specifically into BAT of obese mice restored vascularity, ameliorated brown adipocyte dysfunction, and improved insulin sensitivity. The capillary rarefaction in BAT that was brought about by obesity or Vegfa ablation diminished \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, increased mitochondrial ROS production, and promoted mitophagy. These data indicate that overnutrition leads to the development of a hypoxic state in BAT, causing it to whiten through mitochondrial dysfunction and loss.

Detailed analyses of the persistence of the respiratory deficits following this treatment and means to restore a normal state have not been investigated in full detail. In this study, high oxygen administration to neonatal mouse lungs was established as a proxy to hyperoxia in human preterm infant lungs, to better characterize the associated deficits and thus provide a means to assist in the development of treatments in the future.\nNinety percent oxygen was administered to newborn mice for four consecutive days. The effects of this treatment upon alveolarization and vascularization were investigated by morphometric, histochemical, immunohistochemical and protein analyses at day five (D5), D28 and D56 postpartum.\nRelative to control untreated lungs, septation of hyperoxic lungs was significantly reduced and airspaces were significantly enlarged at all stages examined. Furthermore, compared to controls, the number of secondary septa per tissue area was significantly reduced at D5, significantly increased at D28 and then the same as controls at D56. Analysis of vascularization parameters indicated a reduction in mature blood vessel number and the amount of Pecam1 at D5. Both of these parameters returned to control levels by D28.\nThis study suggests that administration of high oxygen to underdeveloped lungs has a transient reductive effect on secondary septal number and pulmonary vascularization and a significant long-term reduction in alveolarization persisting into adulthood.

Microchannels were seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or HUVEC and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) in co-culture, generating constructs with an internal endothelialized microchannel. Histological analysis demonstrated HASMC/HUVEC-seeded constructs with a confluent lining after 7 days with preservation and further maturation of the lining after 14 days. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated von Willebrand factor and CD31(+) endothelial cells along the luminal surface (neointima) and alpha-smooth muscle actin expressing smooth muscle cells in the subendothelial plane (neomedia). Additionally, the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, heparan sulfate and basal lamina collagen IV were detected after 14 days of culture.

Our specialty is the treatment of benign and malignant bone tumors, tumor-like lesions and surgery of soft tissue tumors.

Limb saving surgery is an interdisciplinary activity both in diagnosis and in treatment. We have proper pathology, radiology and interventional radiology background for the fast and advanced pathomorphological and radiomorphological diagnosis of different tumors. Using modern chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other advanced cancer treatment protocols rapid access to oncology background is provided for children and adults as well, both primary and secondary bone tumors and soft tissue sarcoma cases of the extremities. The limb saving surgery after removal of the tumor is essentially a reconstructive surgery. Reconstructive surgery in childhood and younger ages mean mainly the biological solutions (vascularized autologus bone grafts and/or homologous bone graft), otherwise in elderly ages implantation of tumor endoprostheses has a greater significance. Furthermore, the final tumor surgery requires experienced abdominal surgeon, vascular surgeon and plastic surgeon to ensure the background as well.

{"title": "An engineered muscle flap for reconstruction of large soft tissue defects.", "abstract": "Large soft tissue defects involve significant tissue loss, requiring surgical reconstruction. Autologous flaps are occasionally scant, demand prolonged transfer surgery, and induce donor site morbidity. The present work set out to fabricate an engineered muscle flap bearing its own functional vascular pedicle for repair of a large soft tissue defect in mice. Full-thickness abdominal wall defect was reconstructed using this engineered vascular muscle flap. A 3D engineered tissue constructed of a porous, biodegradable polymer scaffold embedded with endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and/or myoblasts was cultured in vitro and then implanted around the femoral artery and veins before being transferred, as an axial flap, with its vascular pedicle to reconstruct a full-thickness abdominal wall defect in the same mouse. Within 1 wk of implantation, scaffolds showed extensive functional vascular density and perfusion and anastomosis with host vessels. At 1 wk posttransfer, the engineered muscle flaps were highly vascularized, were well-integrated within the surrounding tissue, and featured sufficient mechanical strength to support the abdominal viscera. Thus, the described engineered muscle flap, equipped with an autologous vascular pedicle, constitutes an effective tool for reconstruction of large defects, thereby circumventing the need for both harvesting autologous flaps and postoperative scarification.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-04-09", "authors": ["YuliaShandalov", "DanaEgozi", "JacobKoffler", "DekelDado-Rosenfeld", "DavidBen-Shimol", "AlinaFreiman", "ErezShor", "AvivaKabala", "ShulamitLevenberg"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1402679111"}

Endothelial cells are increasingly used in tissue-engineered constructs to obtain prevascularization and to enhance in vivo neovascularization. Rat bone marrow stromal cells were cultured in thermoresponsive dishes under osteogenic conditions with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to obtain homotypic or heterotypic cell sheets (CSs). Cells were retrieved as sheets from the dishes after incubation at 20\u2009\u00b0C. Monoculture osteogenic CSs were stacked on top of homotypic or heterotypic CSs, and subcutaneously implanted in the dorsal flap of nude mice for 7 days. The implants showed mineralized tissue formation under both conditions. Transplanted osteogenic cells were found at the new tissue site, demonstrating CS bone-inductive effect. Perfused vessels, positive for human CD31, confirmed the contribution of HUVECs for the neovascularization of coculture CS constructs. Furthermore, calcium quantification and expression of osteocalcin and osterix genes were higher for the CS constructs, with HUVECs demonstrating the more robust osteogenic potential of these constructs.

The incidence of early IMR in the setting of primary PCI, its progression and clinical impact over time is still undetermined. We sought to determine the predictors and prognosis of early IMR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nUsing our primary PCI database, we screened for patients who underwent \u22652 transthoracic echocardiograms early (1-3 days) and late (1 year) following primary PCI.

Post-primary PCI IMR was absent in 95 patients (55%), mild in 60 (34%), and moderate to severe in 19 (11%). Early after primary PCI, IMR was independently predicted by an ischemic time > 540 min (OR: 2.92 [95% CI, 1.28 - 7.05]; p = 0.01), and female gender (OR: 3.06 [95% CI, 1.42 - 6.89]; p = 0.004).

General indications for this flap were wounds and small- and medium-sized defects located in distal areas of the lower extremity, not suitable for coverage with myocutaneous or muscle pedicled flaps.

{"title": "In vivo hyperoxia induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 overexpression in LNCaP tumors without affecting the tumor growth rate.", "abstract": "Hypoxia is a recognized cause for solid tumors malignancy and resistance, probably via hypoxia-induced overexpression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, major modulator of the cell response to oxygen deprivation. Although hyperoxia, the opposite condition, may represent a key issue to assess this paradigm, its effect on tumor growth and HIF-1\u03b1 expression remains unclear. To test whether hyperoxia and hypoxia have divergent effects, and to better focus into the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in vivo, athymic mice xenografted with LNCaP cells were exposed for 28 days to atmospheres containing 10, 21 or 30% O2. Whereas the xenografts grew twice faster in hypoxia, their growth rates in hyperoxia and normoxia were similar. To analyze the involved molecular mechanisms, we performed various assays in xenograft tissues. Faster xenografts growth in hypoxia was associated with higher phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and higher expression of Ki67, both related with pro-survival and cell proliferation pathways. By contrast, the expression level of HIF-1\u03b1 was similar in normoxia and hypoxia, but paradoxically twice higher in hyperoxia. The protein level of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) was also higher in hyperoxia, suggesting marked cell response to redox imbalance. Whereas both the vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R2 were overexpressed in hyperoxia, the tissue hemoglobin content was not increased, despite a slight reduction in vascularization. As a whole, this data indicates that the xenografts growth rate was independent of HIF-1\u03b1 expression level, suggesting that in an in vivo setting alternative more effective proliferative paths associated with the cell response to the redox imbalance may override the paths linked to HIF-1\u03b1 signaling.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2014-04-08", "authors": ["LauraTerraneo", "EleonoraVirgili", "AnnaCaretti", "PaolaBianciardi", "MicheleSamaja"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2014.03.019"}
{"title": "Correspondence of retinal thinning and vasculopathy in mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy.", "abstract": "The aberrantly vascularized peripheral retina in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) may be associated with visual field constriction, retinal dysfunction, and abnormalities in retinal thickness which is commonly assessed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). However, due to the limitation of SDOCT for peripheral retinal imaging, retinal thickness in avascular peripheral retina in ROP has not been evaluated. Oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) in mice has features of vasculopathy similar to those in human ROP. These features occur in the posterior retina and thereby are accessible by standard imaging methods. The purpose of the current study was to determine the correspondence between abnormalities in retinal thickness and vasculopathy in neonatal OIR mice by simultaneous SDOCT imaging and fluorescein angiography (FA). Newborn mice (N\u00a0=\u00a019; C57BL/6J strain) were exposed to 77% oxygen from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P12. Age-matched control mice (N\u00a0=\u00a012) were raised in room air. FA and SDOCT were performed in mice between P17 and P19 to visualize retinal vasculature and measure retinal thickness, respectively. Retinal thickness measurements in vascular regions of interest (ROIs) of control mice, and in hypovascular and avascular ROIs of OIR mice were compared. In control mice, FA showed uniformly dense retinal capillary networks between major retinal vessels and retinal thickness of vascular ROIs was 260\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0\u03bcm (N\u00a0=\u00a012). In OIR mice, FA displayed hypovascular regions with less dense and fewer capillaries and avascular regions devoid of visible capillaries. Retinal thickness measurements of hypovascular and avascular ROIs were 243\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0\u03bcm and 209\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0\u03bcm (N\u00a0=\u00a019), respectively.

The aim of this study was to analyse the localization of anastomoses between the infraorbital and posterior superior alveolar artery on 101 computed tomography (CT) scans of maxillary sinuses (patients aged 18-70 years). The distance from the anastomosis to the bone point was measured on CT scans for each tooth location; for edentulous patients measurements were made to the lower edge of the alveolar process, and for dentate patients to the neck of the tooth. Measurements were done independently by two observers. The anastomosis analysed was identified on 50% of CT scans. The distance to the anastomosis was longest above the premolar (20.4 mm from tooth cervical line) and shortest above the first molar (15.9 mm to the edge of the alveolar process). The anastomosis can be localized on a CT scan for exact positioning of the antrotomy in 50% of patients. For the remaining patients, the anatomical information provided in this study can be used to reduce the risk of damage to the anastomosis.

The aim of this study was to develop a new type of artificial bone by transferring the VEGF gene into marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and seeding them into a porous scaffold.\nAn adenovirus vector was employed to transfer the VEGF gene into MSCs and expression of the exogenous gene was confirmed by ELISA. Next the transduced cells were seeded into a collagen I modified PLGA/TCP scaffold. The constructed new complex artificial bone was then assessed for biocompatibility in vitro and blood vessel formation and bone formation in vivo.\nWe found that adenovirus mediated VEGF gene transfer into MSCs sustained VEGF expression in MSCs for 3 weeks. Porous scaffold PLGA/TCP made by rapid prototyping technology exhibited improved biocompatibility resulting from crosslinking with collagen I. Furthermore, the in vivo study showed that large amounts of blood vessels were detected histologically 1 week after artificial bone implantation, and significant bone formation was detected 8 weeks after implantation.\nOur findings suggest that gene transfer of VEGF into MSCs combined with PLGA/TCP scaffold enhances bone repair in vivo by promoting vascularization.", "journal": "Archives of medical science : AMS", "date": "2014-04-05", "authors": ["ChunguangDuan", "JianLiu", "ZhiYuan", "GuolinMeng", "XiumeiYang", "ShuaijunJia", "JinkangZhang", "ShiChen"], "doi": "10.5114/aoms.2012.30950"}

To provide more insight into the role of cell walls in effecting changes in plant structure and function, and in particular their role in the generation of vascularization, an antibody-based approach was implemented to compare the presence and distribution of cell-wall glycan epitopes between (free-living) gametophytes and sporophytes of Ceratopteris richardii 'C-Fern', a widely used model system for ferns.\nMicroarrays of sequential diamino-cyclohexane-tetraacetic acid (CDTA) and NaOH extractions of gametophytes, spores and different organs of 'C-Fern' sporophytes were probed with glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies. The same probes were employed to investigate the tissue- and cell-specific distribution of glycan epitopes.\nWhile monoclonal antibodies against pectic homogalacturonan, mannan and xyloglucan widely labelled gametophytic and sporophytic tissues, xylans were only detected in secondary cell walls of the sporophyte. The LM5 pectic galactan epitope was restricted to sporophytic phloem tissue. Rhizoids and root hairs showed similarities in arabinogalactan protein (AGP) and xyloglucan epitope distribution patterns.\nThe differences and similarities in glycan cell-wall composition between 'C-Fern' gametophytes and sporophytes indicate that the molecular design of cell walls reflects functional specialization rather than genetic origin.

{"title": "Distinct VEGF functions during bone development and homeostasis.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is a key regulator of physiological hemangiogenesis during development, postnatal growth, and homeostasis. It is well known that VEGF is required for effective coupling of angiogenesis to endochondral and membranous bone formation during skeletal development. However, less well known are the roles of VEGF in regulating the differentiation and/or functions of skeletal cells such as chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. In this review, we discuss some of these functions. During early skeletal development, VEGF is important for the survival of chondrocytes in the hypoxic regions of the cartilage models of future bones, the vascularization of developing bones and proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Postnatally, osteoblast-derived VEGF is critical for maintaining bone homeostasis by stimulating the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and repressing their differentiation to adipocytes. Recent data indicate that these effects of VEGF on osteogenic/adipogenic stem cell fates are based on an intracellular (intracrine) mechanism. In contrast, osteoblast-derived VEGF is also known to stimulate the differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts by a paracrine mechanism. Mice with VEGF-deficient osteoblastic lineage cells exhibit age-dependent loss of bone mass and an increase in bone marrow fat. These changes are similar to the changes associated with osteoporosis in humans. Thus, a better understanding of the intracellular mechanisms by which VEGF regulates osteoblastic and adipogenic differentiation may lead to the identification of new targets for therapies to prevent osteoporotic bone loss.", "journal": "Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis", "date": "2014-04-05", "authors": ["YanqiuLiu", "Bjorn ROlsen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00005-014-0285-y"}

Plant-derived phenolic compounds attenuate prostate cancer growth in preclinical models by several mechanisms, which is in line with epidemiological findings suggesting that consumption of plant-based diets is associated with low risk of prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a novel lignan-stilbenoid mixture in PC-3M-luc2 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts. Lignan and stilbenoid -rich extract was obtained from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) knots. Pine knot extract as well as stilbenoids (methyl pinosylvin and pinosylvin), and lignans (matairesinol and nortrachelogenin) present in pine knot extract showed antiproliferative and proapoptotic efficacy at \u2265 40 \u03bcM concentration in vitro. Furthermore, pine knot extract derived stilbenoids enhanced tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis already at \u2265 10 \u03bcM concentrations. In orthotopic PC-3M-luc2 xenograft bearing immunocompromized mice, three-week peroral exposure to pine knot extract (52 mg of lignans and stilbenoids per kg of body weight) was well tolerated and showed anti-tumorigenic efficacy, demonstrated by multivariate analysis combining essential markers of tumor growth (i.e. tumor volume, vascularization, and cell proliferation). Methyl pinosylvin, pinosylvin, matairesinol, nortrachelogenin, as well as resveratrol, a metabolite of pinosylvin, were detected in serum at total concentration of 7-73 \u03bcM, confirming the bioavailability of pine knot extract derived lignans and stilbenoids. In summary, our data indicates that pine knot extract is a novel and cost-effective source of resveratrol, methyl pinosylvin and other bioactive lignans and stilbenoids. Pine knot extract shows anticarcinogenic efficacy in preclinical prostate cancer model, and our in vitro data suggests that compounds derived from the extract may have potential as novel chemosensitizers to TRAIL.

{"title": "Immuno-expression of endoglin and smooth muscle actin in the vessels of brain metastases. Is there a rational for anti-angiogenic therapy?", "abstract": "Despite ongoing clinical trials, the efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of brain metastases (BM) is still questionable. The lower response rate to anti-angiogenic therapy in the presence of BM than in metastatic disease involving other sites suggests that BM may be insensitive to these drugs, although the biological reasons underlining this phenomenon are still to be clarified. With the aim of assessing whether the targets of anti-angiogenic therapies are actually present in BM, in the present study, we analyzed the microvessel density (MVD), a measure of neo-angiogenesis, and the vascular phenotype (mature vs. immature) in the tumor tissue of a series of BM derived from different primary tumors. By using immunohistochemistry against endoglin, a specific marker for newly formed vessels, we found that neo-angiogenesis widely varies in BM depending on the site of the primary tumor, as well as on its histotype. According to our results, BM from lung cancer displayed the highest MVD counts, while those from renal carcinoma had the lowest. Then, among BM from lung cancer, those from large cell and adenocarcinoma histotypes had significantly higher MVD counts than those originating from squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.0043; p=0.0063). Of note, MVD counts were inversely correlated with the maturation index of the endoglin-stained vessels, reflected by the coverage of smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive pericytes (r=-0.693; p<0.0001). Accordingly, all the endoglin-positive vessels in BM from pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma and renal carcinoma, displayed a mature phenotype, while vessels with an immature phenotype were found in highly vascularized BM from pulmonary large cell and adenocarcinoma. The low MVD and mature phenotype observed in BM from some primary tumors may account for their low sensitivity to anti-angiogenic therapies. Although our findings need to be validated in correlative studies with a clinical response, this should be taken into account in therapeutic protocols in order to avoid the adverse effects of useless therapies.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2014-04-05", "authors": ["ValeriaBarresi", "GiovanniBranca", "MariaCaffo", "RosarioCaltabiano", "AntonioIeni", "EnricaVitarelli", "SalvatoreLanzafame", "GiovanniTuccari"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms15045663"}

In order to assess the production of angiogenetic growth factors, this study investigated the content of insulin growth factor (IGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), leptin, and metallothioneine-9 (MMP-9) in the SVF after incubation in differentiation or proliferation media. The SVF was isolated from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Cells were either cultured in proliferation medium (PM) or in differentiation medium (DM). The samples were analysed for the respective factors using ELISA after 3 and 6 days. The GF levels showed a distinctive characteristic over time depending on the culture medium. IGF, PDGF, and MMP-9 levels decreased with PM and increased with DM. VEGF levels were increased in both media. Leptin showed a decrease in both media. The differentiation medium was associated with high inter-individual distribution in growth factor production except for PDGF and Leptin. In conclusion, incubation with differentiation medium produces a more reliable increase of selected growth factors than incubation with proliferation medium.

Cholangiocyte proliferation is critical for the maintenance of the biliary mass and secretory function during the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies. Proliferating cholangiocytes serve as a neuroendocrine compartment during the progression of cholangiopathies, and as such secrete and respond to hormones, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides contributing to the autocrine and paracrine pathways that regulate biliary homeostasis.

HP and PHT groups had a significant increase in VEGF and TGF-b expression in burn wound healing area compared to the control group on all days.\nTopical application of HP can promote re-epithelialization in burn wounds to shorten the wound healing time for superficial burns. Phenytoin, on the other hand, contributes to healing by increasing vascularized granulation tissue and collagen synthesis through re-epithelialization.

To do so, a variety of hurdles must be overcome. In particular, a reliable source of human-sized scaffolds, as well as a method of terminal sterilization of scaffolds, must be identified. Continued research in lung cell and developmental biology will hopefully help identify the number and types of cells that will be required to regenerate functional lung tissue. Finally, bioreactor designs must be improved in order to provide more precise ventilation stimuli and vascular perfusion in order to avoid injury to or death of the cells cultivated within the scaffold.

The vascular pedicle, through the supply of nutritional substances and drugs from the bloodstream, ensures the vitality of the flap, rapid bone integration, and reduced risk of infection.However, due to many surgeons' concerns about orocervical and orosinusal fistulas and infections, bone flaps are usually buried and protected by mucosal flaps or a second skin flap whenever it is not possible to harvest a skin paddle together with the bone flap.The authors, convinced that naked bone free flaps, if well vascularized, are capable of healing and repairing the osteomucosal deficit on their own, with no risk of infection or fistulas, began to harvest, for oral reconstructions, naked bone flaps, that is, bone flaps covered only by a muscle layer 5 to 20 mm thick.In this study, the authors present a review of their experience in oral cavity reconstructions by harvesting naked and covered bone free flaps, retrospectively evaluating the occurrence of major and minor, early and late complications, associated with the different reconstructive technique.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2014-04-03", "authors": ["PaoloGennaro", "MarcoDella Monaca", "Ikenna ValentineAboh", "PaoloPriore", "AriannaFacchini", "ValentinoValentini"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e31829fd298"}
{"title": "Fascia-only anterolateral thigh flap for extremity reconstruction.", "abstract": "The ability to use the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap as a vascularized fascial flap, without skin or muscle, was first documented by Koshima et al in 1989. The authors mention the possibility of using the fascia alone for dural reconstruction. Despite its description more than 20 years ago, little literature exists on the application of the ALT flap as a vascularized fascial flap. In our experience, the ALT flap can be used as a fascia-only flap for thin, pliable coverage in extremity reconstruction.\nAfter approval from the institutional review board, the medical records and photographs of patients who had undergone fascia-only ALT free flaps for extremity reconstruction were reviewed. Photographic images of patients were then matched to patients who had undergone either a muscle-only or a fasciocutaneous free flap reconstruction of an extremity. Photographs of the final reconstruction were then given to medical and nonmedical personnel for analysis, focusing on aesthetics including color and contour.\nReview of cases performed over a 2-year period demonstrated similar ease of harvest for fascia-only ALT flaps compared to standard fasciocutaneous ALT flaps. Fascia-only flaps were used for thin, pliable coverage in the upper and lower extremities. There was no need for secondary procedures for debulking or aesthetic flap revision. In contrast to muscle flaps, which require muscle atrophy over time to achieve their final appearance, there was a similar flap contour from approximately 1 month postoperatively throughout the duration of follow-up. When a large flap is required, the fascia-only ALT has the advantage of a single-line donor-site scar. Photograph comparison to muscle flaps with skin grafts and fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated improved color, contour, and overall aesthetic appearance of the fascia-only ALT over muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps.\nThe fascia-only ALT flap provides reliable, thin, and pliable coverage with improved contour and color over muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps.

To circumvent this problem, a new class of agent inhibiting multiple key pathways important in this disease is being developed to reduce the likelihood of developing resistant disease. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and STAT3 pathways are constitutively activated in 50% to 70% of melanomas, promoting disease development. To identify a drug simultaneously targeting the PI3K, MAPK, and STAT3 cascades, a natural product library was screened to identify leelamine as a potential inhibitor. Leelamine was 4.5-fold more effective at inhibiting cultured melanoma cell survival than normal cells, with average IC(50) values of 2 and 9.3 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. It inhibited cellular proliferation at a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcmol/L by 40% to 80% and longer exposure increased apoptosis 600%. Leelamine inhibited the growth of preexisting xenografted melanoma tumors by an average of 60% by targeting the PI3K, MAPK, and STAT3 pathways without affecting animal body weight or blood markers of major organ function. The mechanism of action of leelamine is mediated by disruption of cholesterol transport, causing decreased cellular proliferation and consequently leading to increased tumor cell apoptosis as well as decreased tumor vascularization. Thus, a unique agent and novel mechanism of action has been identified for the treatment of melanoma that acts by inhibiting the activity of three major signaling pathways regulating the development of this disease.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2014-04-02", "authors": ["RaghavendraGowda", "SubbaRao VMadhunapantula", "Omer FKuzu", "AratiSharma", "Gavin PRobertson"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0867"}

The Oxford Level of Evidence Guidelines and GRADE recommendations were used to rate the quality of evidence and to make treatment recommendations.\n19 studies fit the inclusion criteria constituting 321 ankles at final follow-up.

Due to study quality, imprecise and sparse data, and potential for reporting bias, the quality of evidence is \"very low\". Studies investigating conservative therapy showed that prolonged protective weight bearing provides the best outcomes in early talar AVN.\nGiven the \"very low\" GRADE recommendation, understanding of talar AVN would be significantly altered by higher quality studies. Early talar AVN seems best treated with protected weightbearing and possibly in combination with ESWT. If that fails, core decompression may be an attractive treatment option.

While the cell death rate is elevated in such zones, tumor cells are still suspected to grow and survive independently of extracellular growth factors. In line with this, glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are found closely associated with brain vasculature in situ, and as such are most likely in a protected microenvironment. However, the behavior of GSCs under deprived conditions has not been explored in detail. Using a panel of 14 patient-derived GSCs, we report that ex vivo mitogen deprivation impaired self-renewal capability, abolished constitutive activation of the mTor pathway, and impinged on GSC survival via the engagement of autophagic and apoptotic cascades. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the mTor pathway recapitulated the mitogen deprivation scenario. In contrast, blocking either apoptosis or autophagy, or culturing GSCs with endothelial-secreted factors partly restored mTor pathway activation and rescued GSC survival. Overall, our data suggest that GSCs are addicted to mTor, as their survival and self-renewal are profoundly dependent on this signaling axis. Thus, as mTor governs the fate of GSCs under both deprivation conditions and in the presence of endothelial factors, it could be a key target for therapeutic purposes.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-04-01", "authors": ["Eva MariaGalan-Moya", "LucasTreps", "LisaOliver", "Herv\u00e9Chneiweiss", "Fran\u00e7ois MVallette", "NicolasBid\u00e8re", "JulieGavard"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0093505"}

Three transmyocardial tissue samples were collected prior to ischemia and within 30 min and 150 min of reperfusion.

Fragile elderly patients may particularly benefit from noninvasive and well tolerable immunotherapeutic approaches. Preclinical studies have revealed that the immune-regulatory cytokine IL-27 may exert anti-tumor activities in a variety of tumor types without discernable toxicity. We, thus, investigated whether IL-27 may function as anti-tumor agent in human (h) PCa and analyzed the rationale for its clinical application. In vitro, IL-27 treatment significantly inhibited proliferation and reduced the angiogenic potential of hPCa cells by down-regulating the pro-angiogenesis-related genes fms-related tyrosine kinase (FLT)1, prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/cyclooxygenase-1 (PTGS1/COX-1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)3. In addition, IL-27 up-regulated the anti-angiogenesis-related genes such as CXCL10 and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3). In vivo, IL-27 reduced proliferation and vascularization in association with ischemic necrosis of tumors developed after PC3 or DU145 cell injection in athymic nude mice. In patients' prostate tissues, IL-27R was expressed by normal epithelia and low grade PCa and lost by high tumor grade and stages. Nevertheless, IL-27R was expressed by CD11c(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) leukocytes infiltrating the tumor and draining lymph nodes. These data lead to the conclusion that i) IL-27's anti-PCa potential may be fully exploited in patients with well-differentiated, localized IL-27R positive PCa, since in this case it may act on both cancerous epithelia and the tumor microenvironment; ii) PCa patients bearing high grade and stage tumor that lack IL-27R may benefit, however, from IL-27's immune-stimulatory properties.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2014-04-01", "authors": ["EmmaDi Carlo", "CarloSorrentino", "AlessiaZorzoli", "SerenaDi Meo", "Maria GraziaTupone", "EmanuelaOgnio", "GabriellaMincione", "IrmaAiroldi"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.1425\n10.1002/med.21288/pdf"}

{"title": "Estradiol rapidly modulates odor responses in mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.", "abstract": "In rodents, many social behaviors are driven by the sense of smell. The vomeronasal organ (VNO), part of the accessory olfactory system mediates many of these chemically driven behaviors. The VNO is heavily vascularized, and is readily accessible to circulating peptide or steroid hormones. Potentially, this allows circulating hormones to alter behavior through modulating the output of the primary sensory neurons in the VNO, the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). Based on this, we hypothesized that steroid hormones, in particular 17\u03b2-estradiol, would modulate activity of VSNs. In this paper, we show that the estrogen receptors, GPR30 and ER\u03b1, were present in VSNs and that estradiol may be synthesized locally in the VNO. Our results also showed that 17\u03b2-estradiol decreased responses of isolated VSNs to dilute urine, a potent natural stimulus, with respect to current amplitudes and depolarization. Further, 17\u03b2-estradiol increased the latency of the first action potential (AP) and the AP amplitude. Additionally, calcium responses to sulfated steroids (present in the low molecular weight fraction of urine) that act as ligands for apical vomeronasal receptors were decreased by 17\u03b2-estradiol.

The tissue-engineering of a vascular network in human dermo-epidermal skin substitutes (DESS) is a promising approach to overcome this limitation. Here we report, for the first time, on the use of the adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF)-derived endothelial cell population to tissue-engineer DESS containing a highly efficient capillary plexus. To develop vascular networks in vitro, we employed optimized 3D fibrin or collagen type I hydrogel systems. Upon transplantation onto immune-deficient rats, these pre-formed vascular networks anastomosed to the recipient's vasculature within only four days.

{"title": "Temperature evolution in tissues embedded with large blood vessels during photo-thermal heating.", "abstract": "During laser-assisted photo-thermal therapy, the temperature of the heated tissue region must rise to the therapeutic value (e.g., 43\u00b0C) for complete ablation of the target cells. Large blood vessels (larger than 500 micron in diameter) at or near the irradiated tissues have a considerable impact on the transient temperature distribution in the tissue. In this study, the cooling effects of large blood vessels on temperature distribution in tissues during laser irradiation are predicted using finite element based simulation. A uniform flow is assumed at the entrance and three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer equations in the tissue region and the blood region are simultaneously solved for different vascular models. A volumetric heat source term based on Beer-Lambert law is introduced into the energy equation to account for laser heating. The heating pattern is taken to depend on the absorption and scattering coefficients of the tissue medium. Experiments are also conducted on tissue mimics in the presence and absence of simulated blood vessels to validate the numerical model. The coupled heat transfer between thermally significant blood vessels and their surrounding tissue for three different tissue-vascular networks are analyzed keeping the laser irradiation constant. A surface temperature map is obtained for different vascular models and for the bare tissue (without blood vessels). The transient temperature distribution is seen to differ according to the nature of the vascular network, blood vessel size, flow rate, laser spot size, laser power and tissue blood perfusion rate. The simulations suggest that the blood flow through large blood vessels in the vicinity of the photothermally heated tissue can lead to inefficient heating of the target.", "journal": "Journal of thermal biology", "date": "2014-04-01", "authors": ["AnupPaul", "ArunnNarasimhan", "Franz JKahlen", "Sarit KDas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.02.010"}

Flow was detected using the split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm. Motion artifacts were removed by 3-dimensional (3D) orthogonal registration and merging of 4 scans. The 3D angiography was segmented into 3 layers: inner retina (to show retinal vasculature), outer retina (to identify CNV), and choroid. En face maximum projection was used to obtain 2-dimensional angiograms from the 3 layers. The CNV area and flow index were computed from the en face OCT angiogram of the outer retinal layer. Flow (decorrelation) and structural data were combined in composite color angiograms for both en face and cross-sectional views.\nThe CNV angiogram, CNV area, and CNV flow index.\nEn face OCT angiograms of CNV showed sizes and locations that were confirmed by fluorescein angiography (FA). Optical coherence tomography angiography provided more distinct vascular network patterns that were less obscured by subretinal hemorrhage. The en face angiograms also showed areas of reduced choroidal flow adjacent to the CNV in all cases and significantly reduced retinal flow in 1 case. Cross-sectional angiograms were used to visualize CNV location relative to the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's layer and classify type I and type II CNV. A feeder vessel could be identified in 1 case. Higher flow indexes were associated with larger CNV and type II CNV.\nOptical coherence tomography angiography provides depth-resolved information and detailed images of CNV in neovascular AMD.

More recently, the neurosurgical endoscope has been introduced as a visualization option during removal of skull base tumors, both transcranially and endonasally. The authors retrospectively reviewed the effectiveness of endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) in the management of suprasellar meningiomas.\nBetween 2002 and 2011, 75 patients (81.3% female) with suprasellar meningiomas underwent EES at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The authors present the results of EES and analyze the resection rates, visual outcome, and complications.\nSeventy-one patients presented with primary tumors, whereas 4 were previously treated elsewhere. Their mean age was 57.3 years (range 36-88 years), and most patients presented with visual loss (81.3%). Tumors occupied the tuberculum sellae (86.7%) and planum sphenoidale (50.7%), with extension into the optic canals in 26.7% (unilateral in 21.3% and bilateral in 5.3%) and the pituitary fossa (9.3%). Gross-total tumor resection (Simpson Grade I) was achieved in 76% of the cases in the whole cohort and in 81.4% of the patients in whom it was the goal of surgery. Tumor location and extension into the optic canals was not a limitation for total resection. Tumor size, configuration, and vascular encasement were significant factors that influenced the degree of resection (p < 0.0001). Vision was improved or normalized in 85.7% of the cases. Visual deterioration following EES occurred in 2 patients (3.6%). Complications included postoperative CSF leaks (25.3% overall, 16.1% in recent years) resulting in meningitis in 4 cases. One patient had an intraoperative injury of the artery of Heubner resulting in associated neurological deficit. Another elderly patient died within 1 month after EES due to cerebral vasospasm and multisystem impairment. No patient developed postoperative cerebral contusions, hemorrhage, or seizures. During a mean follow-up period of 29 months (range 1-98 months), 4 patients have shown recurrence, but only 1 required repeat EES.\nWith the goal of gross-total tumor resection and visual improvement, EES can achieve very good results, (comparable to microscopic approaches) for the treatment of suprasellar meningiomas. Avoidance of brain and optic nerve retraction, preservation of the vascularization of the optic apparatus, and wide decompression of the optic canals are the main advantages of EES for the treatment of suprasellar meningiomas, while CSF leaks remain a disadvantage.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2014-04-01", "authors": ["MariaKoutourousiou", "Juan CFernandez-Miranda", "S TonyaStefko", "Eric WWang", "Carl HSnyderman", "Paul AGardner"], "doi": "10.3171/2014.2.JNS13767"}

Proliferation of UM cells incubated with neutralizing anti-VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab (\u2264 2.5 mg/mL), or VEGF-A (\u2264 100 ng/mL) was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) ELISA. It was measured by real-time PCR, whether VEGF-A (100 ng/mL) modulated the expression ratio of VEGF-A itself and its antiangiogenic antagonist pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).\nAll UM cells expressed VEGF-A, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2 mRNA, and protein.

Using a highly selective inhibitor to block MMP-13 protein activity, we demonstrate a striking inhibitory effect on invasive tumor growth and vascularization in murine skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Therapy outcome critically depends on animal age in C57Bl/6 mice and was successful in old female but not in young female mice. Treatment success was recovered by ovariectomy in young and abolished by 17\u00df-estradiol supplementation in old mice, suggesting a hormone dependent inhibitor effect. Responsiveness of the tumorigenic keratinocytes BDVII and fibroblasts to 17\u00df-estradiol was confirmed in vitro, where MMP-13 inhibitor treatment led to a reduction of cell invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. This correlated well with a less invasive and vascularized tumor in treated mice in vivo. 17\u00df-estradiol supplementation also reduced invasion and VEGF release in vitro with no additional reduction on MMP-13 inhibitor treatment. This suggests that low 17\u00df-estradiol levels in old mice in vivo lead to enhanced MMP-13 levels and VEGF release, allowing a more effective inhibitor treatment compared to young mice.

{"title": "XBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1\u03b1 pathway.", "abstract": "Cancer cells induce a set of adaptive response pathways to survive in the face of stressors due to inadequate vascularization. One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours, but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)--a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)--is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1\u03b1 that regulates the expression of HIF1\u03b1 targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1\u03b1 and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis.

A 56-year-old man presented with a large mandibular continuity defect after resection of an enlarged squamous cell carcinoma arising from the floor of the mouth. For secondary reconstruction, the shape of the neomandible and implant position for support of the lower prosthesis were planned virtually. The combined cutting and drilling guide was printed in 3 dimensions. In a 2-step surgical approach, first, the implants were inserted into the fibula and covered with a split-thickness skin graft to form a neogingiva. In a second operation, the fibula was harvested, osteotomized, and fixed with the denture on the preinserted implants. The fibula was placed to its final position guided by the occlusion. Using three-dimensional virtual backward planning, it was feasible to perform a mandibular reconstruction with immediate prosthetic rehabilitation.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2014-03-29", "authors": ["ChristianFreudlsperger", "Jens PhilippBodem", "EvaEngel", "J\u00fcrgenHoffmann"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000000551"}

Over time, serious complications resulting from dental implantology procedures have been reported. This has led to a greater focus on vascularization of the interforaminal region. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the anterior mandibular region in relation to the presence of canals perforating the buccal and lingual cortical plates. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files of 100 cone beam computed tomography scans were analyzed by imaging software. All radiographic cross-sections between the mental foramina were examined to detect the presence and location of perforating buccal or lingual canals. Lingual perforating canals are present in 98% of the cohort. The most common site is the symphysis region. The presence of 2 lingual canals cranially and caudally to the genial apophysis has been found in 39%. Vestibular perforating canals are absent in 61%. The anterior mandible has several lingual perforating canals, which are variable in number and location. Imaging software is a valuable aid in presurgical planning. Because of the higher prevalence of perforating canals in the symphysis region, this site should be preserved.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2014-03-29", "authors": ["RobertoDi Bari", "RobertoCoronelli", "AndreaCicconetti"], "doi": "10.1097/01.scs.0000436735.60042.49"}
{"title": "Biodegradation pattern and tissue integration of native and cross-linked porcine collagen soft tissue augmentation matrices - an experimental study in the rat.", "abstract": "Within the last decades, collagen types I and III have been established as a sufficient biomaterial for GBR and GTR procedures. They might also be an adequate matrix for soft tissue augmentations. However, collagen materials differ significantly regarding resorption time, biodegradation pattern and the invasion of inflammatory cells.The aim of the present study was to compare the biodegradation and tissue integration of native, differently processed and cross-linked collagen scaffolds in rats.\nFour experimental porcine collagen matrices of 1.0 mm thickness, developed for soft tissue augmentation procedures, were tested. Based on the same native dermal Type I and III collagen, native (ND, Mucoderm prototype), specifically defatted (DD), ethylene dioxide cross-linked (ECL) and dehydrothermally cross-linked (DCL) dermis collagen (AAP/Botiss Biomaterials, Berlin, Germany) were evaluated. Two specimens of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091 cm were fixed around a non-absorbable spacer using non-absorbable sutures. After rehydration, specimens (N = 8) were randomly allocated in unconnected subcutaneous pouches on the back of 40 Wistar rats. Rats were divided into five groups (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks), including eight animals each. After each period, eight rats were sacrificed and explanted specimens were prepared for histological analysis. The following parameters were evaluated: membrane thickness as a sign of biodegradation and volume stability, cell ingrowth, vascularization, tissue integration and foreign body reaction.\nBiodegradation pattern of the non cross-linked collagen scaffolds differed only slightly in terms of presence of inflammatory cells and cell invasion into the matrix. In terms of biodegradation, ECL displayed a considerable slower resorption than ND, DCL and DD. Chemical cross-linking using ethylene dioxide showed a significant higher invasion of inflammatory cells.\nWithin the limits of the present study it was concluded that the processing techniques influenced the collagen properties in a different intensity. Dehydrothermal cross-linking and special defatting did not notably change the biodegradation pattern, whereas cross-linking using ethylene dioxide led to significant higher volume stability of the matrix. However, ECL showed an increased inflammatory response and compromised tissue integration. Therefore, ethylene dioxide seems to be not suitable for stabilization of collagen matrices for soft tissue augmentation procedures.", "journal": "Head & face medicine", "date": "2014-03-29", "authors": ["DanielRothamel", "MarcelBenner", "TimFienitz", "ArndtHappe", "MatthiasKreppel", "Hans-JoachimNickenig", "Joachim EZ\u00f6ller"], "doi": "10.1186/1746-160X-10-10\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.1986.tb00854.x\n10.1097/00006534-198805000-00004\n10.1111/j.1600-0757.1993.tb00204.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0757.1998.tb00132.x\n10.1034/j.1600-0501.2001.012001009.x\n10.1016/S0142-9612(96)00175-5\n10.1073/pnas.75.2.871\n10.1902/jop.1984.55.11.623\n10.1902/jop.1997.68.9.857\n10.1902/jop.1995.66.6.495\n10.1007/s10006-006-0681-5\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2007.01486.x\n10.1563/1548-1336(2002)028<0230:ISTMOS>2.3.CO;2\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.1974.tb01257.x\n10.1902/jop.2008.070325\n10.1902/jop.1997.68.2.145\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.2009.01460.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0757.1999.tb00147.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2005.01108.x\n10.1097/00008505-200101000-00016\n10.1902/jop.2008.070361\n10.1002/1097-4636(20001205)52:3<439::AID-JBM1>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1034/j.1600-0501.2003.140302.x\n10.4103/0972-124X.99265\n10.1097/01.id.0000227078.70869.20\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2008.01689.x"}

Although calcineurin promotes maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, we recently showed that the calcineurin splicing variant, CnA\u03b21, has beneficial effects on the infarcted heart. However, whether this variant limits necrosis or improves remodelling is still unknown, precluding translation to the clinical arena. Here, we explored the effects and therapeutic potential of CnA\u03b21 overexpression post-infarction.\nDouble transgenic mice with inducible cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of CnA\u03b21 underwent left coronary artery ligation followed by reperfusion. Echocardiographic analysis showed depressed cardiac function in all infarcted mice 3 days post-infarction. Induction of CnA\u03b21 overexpression 1 week after infarction improved function and reduced ventricular dilatation. CnA\u03b21-overexpressing mice showed shorter, thicker scars, and reduced infarct expansion, accompanied by reduced myocardial remodelling. CnA\u03b21 induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in cardiomyocytes, which resulted in increased infarct vascularization. This paracrine angiogenic effect of CnA\u03b21 was mediated by activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and VEGF.\nOur results indicate that CnA\u03b21 exerts beneficial effects on the infarcted heart by promoting infarct vascularization and preventing infarct expansion.

Ability of candidate drugs administered at sequential remodeling stages to reverse hypertrophy, enlarged LV size and improve cardiac function was monitored. Arguing for clinical relevance of the experimental system, clinically-used drugs operating on the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System (RAAS), namely, the ACE inhibitor Enalapril and the direct renin inhibitor Aliskerin fully reversed remodeling. Remodeling reversal by these drugs was not accompanied by neovascularization and reached a point-of-no-return. Similarly, the PPAR\u03b3 agonist Pioglitazone was proven capable of reversing all aspects of cardiac remodeling without affecting the vasculature. Extending the arsenal of remodeling-reversing drugs to pathways other than RAAS, a specific inhibitor of 11\u03b2-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2 HSD1), a key enzyme required for generating active glucocorticoids, fully rescued myocardial hypertrophy.

{"title": "A novel early precursor cell population from rat bone marrow promotes angiogenesis in vitro.", "abstract": "Some studies demonstrated therapeutic angiogenesis attributable to the effects of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), others have reported disappointing results. This may be due to the fact that EPC populations used in these contradictory studies were selected and defined by highly variable and differing experimental protocols. Indeed, the isolation and reliable characterization of ex vivo differentiated EPC raises considerable problems due to the fact there is no biomarker currently available to specifically identify EPC exclusively. On the other hand traditional differentiation of primary immature bone marrow cells towards the endothelial lineage is a time-consuming process of up to 5\u00a0weeks. To circumvent these shortcomings, we herein describe a facile method to isolate and enrich a primary cell population from rat bone marrow, combining differential attachment methodology with cell sorting technology.\nThe combination of these techniques enabled us to obtain a pure population of early endothelial precursor cells that show homogenous upregulation of CD31 and VEGF-R2 and that are positive for CD146. These cells exhibited typical sprouting on Matrigel\u2122. Additionally, this population displayed endothelial tube formation when resuspended in Matrigel\u2122 as well as in fibrin glue, demonstrating its functional angiogenic capacity. Moreover, these cells stained positive for DiI-ac-LDL and FITC-UEA, two markers that are commonly considered to stain differentiating EPCs. Based upon these observations in this study we describe a novel and time-saving method for obtaining a pure endothelial precursor cell population as early as 2-3\u00a0weeks post isolation that exhibits endothelial abilities in vitro and which still might have retained its early endothelial lineage properties.\nThe rapid isolation and the high angiogenic potential of these syngeneic cells might facilitate and accelerate the pre-vascularization of transplanted tissues and organs also in a human setting in the future.", "journal": "BMC cell biology", "date": "2014-03-29", "authors": ["AndreasBrandl", "QuanYuan", "Anja MBoos", "Justus PBeier", "AndreasArkudas", "UlrichKneser", "Raymund EHorch", "OliverBleiziffer"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2121-15-12\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01564.x\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01545.x\n10.2478/s11658-010-0026-0\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01247.x\n10.1002/jor.22097\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181d4c360\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000114236.77009.06\n10.1186/1465-9921-8-50\n10.1007/s10616-010-9329-2\n10.1182/blood-2004-04-1396\n10.1093/jb/mvm060\n10.1056/NEJMoa022287\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0603\n10.1083/jcb.99.6.2034\n10.1007/s10456-009-9146-4\n10.1089/ten.teb.2007.0435\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.04.003\n10.1164/ajrccm.163.1.9912036\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000052948.64125.AB\n10.1007/s10456-010-9192-y\n10.1056/NEJM199711273372203"}

The posterior layer of the Gerota's fascia appears very thickened at the level of the lower pole of the kidney and is very adherent with the surrounding structures, in particular the psoas muscle.\u2029 Gerota's fascia is incised and removed from the previous surgery and the psoas muscle is identified. The distal lumbar ureter is tenaciously anchored to the psoas muscle. The lower pole of the kidney is freed from the adhesions of the previous surgery. The proximal ureter is hardly isolable for the presence of fibrosis. The renal pelvis is fixed to the psoas due to fibrotic tissue that is cut with scissors. Once the pelvis and the ureter are separated from the psoas, the surgery proceeds with the liberation of the pelvis from the adipose tissue and fibrosis that surround it. The pieloureteral obstruction is not easily identifiable. The renal pelvis is opened at the level of the ureteral junction, the ureter is spatulated on its medial side. The scar tissue is removed until well vascularized tissue is seen. The anastomosis between the ureter and pelvis is performed with 2 semicontinuous running sutures. Once the anterior plate of the anastomosis is completed a cystoscopic retrograde DJ ureteral stent insertion is performed. The procedure ends with the packaging of the posterior plate of the anastomosis with the second running suture.\u2029\nThe operation lasted 180 minutes.

This kind of surgery has to be carried out after having gained considerable laparoscopy experience. Specifically, the reoperation of laparoscopic pyeloplasty after 2 previous intervention poses the following difficulties: the creation of appropriate space, dissection of the ureter and pelvis from the psoas muscle, appropriate mobilization of the lower pole of the kidney to get a \"tension free\" anastomosis, liberation of the pelvis and ureter from the tenaciously adherent fibrotic tissue, identification of the stenotic ureteropelvic junction.\u2029\nLaparoscopic pyeloplasty after failure of past interventions remains a difficult procedure that should only be performed after major laparoscopic experience.

{"title": "Excessive nitrite affects zebrafish valvulogenesis through yielding too much NO signaling.", "abstract": "Sodium nitrite, a common food additive, exists widely not only in the environment but also in our body. Excessive nitrite causes toxicological effects on human health; however, whether it affects vertebrate heart valve development remains unknown. In vertebrates, developmental defects of cardiac valves usually lead to congenital heart disease. To understand the toxic effects of nitrite on valvulogenesis, we exposed zebrafish embryos with different concentrations of sodium nitrite. Our results showed that sodium nitrite caused developmental defects of zebrafish heart dose dependently. It affected zebrafish heart development starting from 36 hpf (hour post fertilization) when heart initiates looping process. Comprehensive analysis on the embryos at 24 hpf and 48 hpf showed that excessive nitrite did not affect blood circulation, vascular network, myocardium and endocardium development. But development of endocardial cells in atrioventricular canal (AVC) of the embryos at 48 hpf was disrupted by too much nitrite, leading to defective formation of primitive valve leaflets at 76 hpf.

{"title": "Rapid engineering of endothelial cell-lined vascular-like structures in in situ crosslinkable hydrogels.", "abstract": "Fabrication of perfusable vascular networks in vitro is one of the most critical challenges in the advancement of tissue engineering. Because cells consume oxygen and nutrients during the fabrication process, a rapid fabrication approach is necessary to construct cell-dense vital tissues and organs, such as the liver. In this study, we propose a rapid molding process using an in situ crosslinkable hydrogel and electrochemical cell transfer for the fabrication of perfusable vascular structures. The in situ crosslinkable hydrogel was composed of hydrazide-modified gelatin (gelatin-ADH) and aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-CHO). By simply mixing these two solutions, the gelation occurred in less than 20 s through the formation of a stable hydrazone bond. To rapidly transfer cells from a culture surface to the hydrogel, we utilized a zwitterionic oligopeptide, which forms a self-assembled molecular layer on a gold surface. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells adhering on a gold surface via the oligopeptide layer were transferred to the hydrogel within 5 min, along with electrochemical desorption of the oligopeptides. This approach was applicable to cylindrical needles 200-700 \u00b5m in diameter, resulting in the formation of perfusable microchannels where the internal surface was fully enveloped with the transferred endothelial cells. The entire fabrication process was completed within 10 min, including 20 s for the hydrogel crosslinking and 5 min for the electrochemical cell transfer. This rapid fabrication approach may provide a promising strategy to construct perfusable vasculatures in cell-dense tissue constructs and subsequently allow cells to organize complicated and fully vascularized tissues while preventing hypoxic cell injury.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["TatsutoKageyama", "TakahiroKakegawa", "TatsuyaOsaki", "JunkoEnomoto", "TaichiIto", "TadashiNittami", "JunjiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/025006"}

However, the ability to form endothelial networks is lost when such gels are allowed to compact via cell-mediated remodeling. In this study, we created co-cultures of human EC and human MSC in both constrained and unconstrained COL/FIB matrices and systematically added nanoparticulate hydroxyapatite (HA, 0-20 mg ml(-1)), a bone-like mineral that has been shown to have pro-vasculogenic effects. Constructs cultured for 7 days were assayed for gel compaction, vascular network formation, and mechanical properties. In vitro, robust endothelial network formation was observed in constrained COL/FIB constructs without HA, but this response was significantly inhibited by addition of 5, 10, or 20 mg ml(-1) HA. In unconstrained matrices, network formation was abolished in pure COL/FIB constructs but was rescued by 1.25 or 2.5 mg ml(-1) HA, while higher levels again inhibited vasculogenesis. HA inhibited gel compaction in a dose-dependent manner, which was not correlated to endothelial network formation. HA affected initial stiffness of the gels, but gel remodeling abrogated this effect. Subcutaneous implantation of COL/FIB with 0, 2.5 or 2 0mg ml(-1) HA in the mouse resulted in increased perfusion at the implant site, with no significant differences between materials.

In trans, complex formation was delayed and phosphorylation of phospholipase C\u03b3 (PLC\u03b3) and extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was prolonged, whereas ERK1 phosphorylation was reduced. Trans complex formation suppressed initiation and vascularization of NRP1-expressing mouse fibrosarcoma and melanoma.

We examined the structural alterations of intratumoral blood vessels in human gastroenteropancreatic NET. Microvessel density was evaluated using the endothelial cell markers vasohibin-1 (VASH-1), CD31, and endoglin in 135 cases. Double immunohistochemistry staining was performed to localize endothelium and pericytes on the same vessels using the pericyte marker nestin. The ratio of Ki-67/CD31 was significantly correlated with that of VASH-1/CD31 positivity (P<.001), indicating that the ratio of VASH-1/CD31 also reflects the status of neovascularization in NET. This ratio was higher in NET than in its nonneoplastic counterpart (P=.10) and tended to increase according to World Health Organization (WHO) grade, although the differences were not statistically significant (P=.32). The ratio of VASH-1/nestin-positive vessels, representing the maturation of neovessels, was also significantly higher in NET than in its nonneoplastic counterparts (P=.003). Among WHO grades, the ratio increased from grade 1 to grade 2 (P=.36) and decreased in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P=.34). Our results demonstrated that VASH-1/CD31 can be an ideal immunohistochemical marker for characterizing neovascularization in NET.

Taking inspiration from biological tissues such as dentin and bone, these mechanical deficiencies can be mitigated by complex hierarchical structural features near to channel surfaces.

Early-stage GBC is curable with complete resection but invisible metastases at unobvious sites remain problematic. In this study, at least 450 patients relapsed, most had peritoneal metastasis. The peritoneum is a common metastatic site, its microenvironment is intrinsically hypoxic, well vascularized and lined with mesothelium overlaying immune aggregates, which express pro-angiogenic and adhesion molecules that are highly selective for tumour growth and evolution. There are no medical/molecular antagonists to inhibit peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Treatment options for these tumors often include surgery with preoperative embolization, which can pose major cardiovascular risk to patients. As demonstrated by this case report, hemodynamic instability following preoperative embolization of a carotid body tumor may indicate severe carotid sinus hypersensitivity and the need for temporary cardiac pacing. OBSERVATIONS This case report describes a man in his early 30s who presented for staged surgical resection of bilateral carotid body tumors with preoperative embolization. After embolization of the second tumor, the patient displayed transient episodes of bradycardia and hypotension, which resolved with medical management. Surgery commenced, and with minimal manipulation intraoperatively, the patient became asystolic and required resuscitation. Following a negative cardiac workup, a temporary pacemaker was implanted, and surgical resection of the tumor was successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a rare but serious risk of preoperative embolization of carotid body tumors.

{"title": "Cell sheet technology-driven re-epithelialization and neovascularization of skin wounds.", "abstract": "Skin regeneration remains a challenge, requiring a well-orchestrated interplay of cell-cell and cell-matrix signalling. Cell sheet (CS) engineering, which has the major advantage of allowing the retrieval of the intact cell layers along with their naturally organized extracellular matrix (ECM), has been poorly explored for the purpose of creating skin substitutes and skin regeneration. This work proposes the use of CS technology to engineer cellular constructs based on human keratinocytes (hKC), key players in wound re-epithelialization, dermal fibroblasts (hDFb), responsible for ECM remodelling, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hDMEC), part of the dermal vascular network and modulators of angiogenesis. Homotypic and heterotypic three-dimensional (3-D) CS-based constructs were developed simultaneously to target wound re-vascularization and re-epithelialization. After implantation of the constructs in murine full-thickness wounds, human cells were engrafted into the host wound bed and were present in the neotissue formed up to 14 days post-implantation. Different outcomes were obtained by varying the composition and organization of the 3-D constructs. Both hKC and hDMEC significantly contributed to re-epithelialization by promoting rapid wound closure and early epithelial coverage. Moreover, a significant increase in the density of vessels at day 7 and the incorporation of hDMEC in the neoformed vasculature confirmed its role over neotissue vacularization. As a whole, the obtained results confirmed that the proposed 3-D CS-based constructs provided the necessary cell machinery, when in a specific microenvironment, guiding both re-vascularization and re-epithelialization. Although dependent on the nature of the constructs, the results obtained sustain the hypothesis that different CS-based constructs lead to improved skin healing.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["M TCerqueira", "R PPirraco", "A RMartins", "T CSantos", "R LReis", "A PMarques"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.03.006"}

Delayed tPA intervention drastically increased the risk of HT and exaggerated the ischemic injury. To assess the effect of IMM-H004 on delayed treatment of tPA-induced toxicity after ischemia and reperfusion, various approaches were used, including a behavior test, TTC-staining, determination of cerebral hemorrhage, laser speckle imaging, Western blot, gelatin zymogram, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining.

Combination therapy of tPA and IMM-H004 prevented the development of HT, and reduced the mortality rate, infarct volume and brain edema. IMM-H004 also exerted a protective role by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases, the co-localization of matrix metalloproteinase-2 with astrocytes and increasing occludin.

Specifically, we previously showed that supplemental choline reduced placental and maternal circulating concentrations of the anti-angiogenic factor, fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT1), in pregnant women as well as sFLT1 production in cultured human trophoblasts. The current study aimed to quantify the effect of choline on a wider array of biomarkers related to trophoblast function and to elucidate possible mechanisms. Immortalized HTR-8/SVneo trophoblasts were cultured in different choline concentrations (8, 13, and 28\u2009\u00b5M [control]) for 96-h and markers of angiogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and blood vessel formation were examined. Choline insufficiency altered the angiogenic profile, impaired in vitro angiogenesis, increased inflammation, induced apoptosis, increased oxidative stress, and yielded greater levels of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms \u03b4 and \u03f5 possibly through increases in the PKC activators 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycerol. Notably, the addition of a PKC inhibitor normalized angiogenesis and apoptosis, and partially rescued the aberrant gene expression profile.

{"title": "Treatment of medulloblastoma with oncolytic measles viruses expressing the angiogenesis inhibitors endostatin and angiostatin.", "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common type of pediatric brain tumor. Although numerous factors influence patient survival rates, more than 30% of all cases will ultimately be refractory to conventional therapies. Current standards of care are also associated with significant morbidities, giving impetus for the development of new treatments. We have previously shown that oncolytic measles virotherapy is effective against medulloblastoma, leading to significant prolongation of survival and even cures in mouse xenograft models of localized and metastatic disease. Because medulloblastomas are known to be highly vascularized tumors, we reasoned that the addition of angiogenesis inhibitors could further enhance the efficacy of oncolytic measles virotherapy. Toward this end, we have engineered an oncolytic measles virus that express a fusion protein of endostatin and angiostatin, two endogenous and potent inhibitors of angiogenesis.\nOncolytic measles viruses encoding human and mouse variants of a secretable endostatin/angiostatin fusion protein were designed and rescued according to established protocols. These viruses, known as MV-hE:A and MV-mE:A respectively, were then evaluated for their anti-angiogenic potential and efficacy against medulloblastoma cell lines and orthotopic mouse models of localized disease.\nMedulloblastoma cells infected by MV-E:A readily secrete endostatin and angiostatin prior to lysis. The inclusion of the endostatin/angiostatin gene did not negatively impact the measles virus' cytotoxicity against medulloblastoma cells or alter its growth kinetics. Conditioned media obtained from these infected cells was capable of inhibiting multiple angiogenic factors in vitro, significantly reducing endothelial cell tube formation, viability and migration compared to conditioned media derived from cells infected by a control measles virus. Mice that were given a single intratumoral injection of MV-E:A likewise showed reduced numbers of tumor-associated blood vessels and a trend for increased survival compared to mice treated with the control virus.\nThese data suggest that oncolytic measles viruses encoding anti-angiogenic proteins may have therapeutic benefit against medulloblastoma and support ongoing efforts to target angiogenesis in medulloblastoma.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["BrianHutzen", "Hemant KumarBid", "Peter JHoughton", "Christopher RPierson", "KimerlyPowell", "AnnaBratasz", "CoreyRaffel", "Adam WStudebaker"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-14-206\n10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01424-X\n10.1038/ncponc0794\n10.1200/JCO.2006.06.4980\n10.1016/S0959-8049(98)00212-3\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.10.038\n10.1038/clpt.2010.211\n10.1093/neuonc/noq057\n10.1093/neuonc/nor231\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62352-5\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1252\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.03.008\n10.1203/01.pdr.0000305884.29279.6b\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81848-6\n10.1101/SQB.1994.059.01.052\n10.1016/S1097-2765(04)00102-9\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.11.015\n10.1083/jcb.152.6.1247\n10.1126/science.295.5563.2198\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.1486\n10.1128/JVI.02389-05\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1002/pbc.22868\n10.1002/pbc.24006\n10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00225-8\n10.1200/JCO.2002.02.082\n10.1200/JCO.2003.12.120\n10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6762\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0804\n10.1038/gt.2009.74\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0867\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0884\n10.1089/hum.2006.17.556\n10.1006/gyno.1999.5614\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9098(199703)64:3<222::AID-JSO9>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.002\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2762"}

There is increasing evidence that myeloid cell lineages play a role in neovascularization. In this study, the efficiency of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells to home to the site of injury and enhance diabetic wound healing by neoangiogenesis after intravenous administration was investigated. Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells were injected into tail vein after establishment of dorsal window chamber, hindlimb ischaemia and ear-punch injury in diabetic or non-diabetic mice. The Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells efficiently homed to the site of injury after intravenous administration and increased neoangiogenesis. The chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is robustly expressed by Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells. Inhibition of CXCR4 decreases the homing ability of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells to the site of injury, which indicates that the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis plays an important role in the homing of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells to the site of injury. In addition, Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells were found to improve blood flow recovery of ischaemic limb and enhance wound healing in diabetic mice by neoangiogenesis after intravenous administration.

Three newborn females, stranded dead on the coast of Sergipe and Bahia, Brazil, were used.

The Humpback whale sclera was thick and had an irregular surface with mechanoreceptors in its lamina propria. Lens was dense, transparent, and ellipsoidal, consisting of three layers, and the vascularized choroid contains melanocytes, mechanoreceptors, and a fibrous tapetum lucidum.

This disease is characterized by inconspicuous onset, high malignancy, and poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of cinnamaldehyde on melanoma tumorigenicity and its mechanism. Melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected into a nude mouse to establish the tumour model. A comparison was made for the difference in formation and growth of melanoma cell tumor between normal saline and cinnamaldehyde. A comparison was also made for the number of new vessels between the normal saline group (the control group) and the cinnamaldehyde group (the experimental group) through immumohistochemical staining. The western blot was used to detect the difference in expression levels of vascularization related proteins. The results indicated that the volume of tumors formed and the number of new vessels in melanoma cells of the cinnamaldehyde group decreased significantly compared with those in the cells of the normal saline group. A further study indicated that the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-a (HIF-\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the melanoma of the cinnamaldehyde group decreased significantly.

Therefore, a set of in situ-forming starPEG-heparin hydrogels was used to identify matrix parameters and cellular interactions that best support EC morphogenesis. We showed that a particular type of soft, matrix metalloproteinase-degradable hydrogel containing covalently bound integrin ligands and reversibly conjugated pro-angiogenic growth factors could boost the development of highly branched, interconnected, and lumenized endothelial capillary networks. Using these effective matrix conditions, 3D heterocellular interactions of ECs with different mural cells were demonstrated that enabled EC network modulation and maintenance of stable vascular capillaries over periods of about one month in vitro. The approach was also shown to permit in vitro tumor vascularization experiments with unprecedented levels of control over both ECs and tumor cells.

{"title": "Therapeutic effects of the transplantation of VEGF overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the hippocampus of murine model of Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by progressive memory loss, behavioral and learning dysfunction and cognitive deficits, such as alterations in social interactions. The major pathological features of AD are the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles together with neuronal and vascular damage. The double transgenic mouse model of AD (2xTg-AD) with the APPswe/PS1dE9 mutations shows characteristics that are similar to those observed in AD patients, including social memory impairment, senile plaque formation and vascular deficits. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), when transplanted into the brain, produce positive effects by reducing amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition in transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilins1 (PS1) mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), exhibits neuroprotective effects against the excitotoxicity implicated in the AD neurodegeneration. The present study investigates the effects of MSCs overexpressing VEGF in hippocampal neovascularization, cognitive dysfunction and senile plaques present in 2xTg-AD transgenic mice. MSC were transfected with vascular endothelial growth factor cloned in uP vector under control of modified CMV promoter (uP-VEGF) vector, by electroporation and expanded at the 14th passage. 2xTg-AD animals at 6, 9 and 12 months old were transplanted with MSC-VEGF or MSC. The animals were tested for behavioral tasks to access locomotion, novelty exploration, learning and memory, and their brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vascularization and A\u03b2 plaques.

The ARP genes encode MYB transcription factors that interact with Class 1 KNOX genes in a regulatory module that controls meristem-leaf determinations and is highly conserved in plants. ARP loss of function alleles and subsequent KNOX1 overexpression cause many unusual leaf phenotypes including loss or partial loss of the ability to produce a lamina and production of \"knots\" on leaf blades. CRISPA (CRI) is the ARP gene in pea, and a number of its mutant alleles are known.\nWe made morphological and anatomical evaluations of cri-1 mutant plants while controlling for genetic background and for heteroblastic effects, and we used aldehyde fixation and resin preparations for anatomical analysis. Further, we compared gene expression in WT and cri-1 shoot tips and HOP1/PsKN1 and CRI expression in other leaf mutants.\nThe cri-1 plants had more extensive abnormalities in the proximal than in the distal regions of the leaf, including ectopic stipules, narrow leaflets, and shortened petioles with excessive adaxial expansion. \"Knots\" were morphologically and anatomically variable but consisted of vascularized out-pocketing of the adaxial leaflet surface. HOP1/PsKN1 and UNI mRNA levels were higher in cri-1 shoot tips, and some auxin-regulated genes were lower. Low LE expression suggests that the GA level is high in cri-1 shoot tips.\nThe CRISPA gene of pea suppresses KNOX1 genes and UNI and functions to (1) maintain proximal-distal regions in their appropriate positions, (2) restrict excessive adaxial cell proliferation, and (3) promote laminar expansion.", "journal": "American journal of botany", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["Darleen ADeMason", "VenkateswariChetty"], "doi": "10.3732/ajb.1300415"}

{"title": "Place of hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases.", "abstract": "The rationale for hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy (HACT) is based on the predominantly arterial vascularization of liver metastases (HM). The intra-arterial route of administration thus increases the exposure of tumor cells to cytotoxic agents while limiting systemic toxicity. Chemotherapy is administered through a catheter placed in the gastroduodenal artery by either a surgical or percutaneous approach. Several anticancer agents can be administered to hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (HMCRC) by HACT. Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), used mainly in the United States, has a high intrahepatic extraction rate but also has intrinsic hepatobiliary toxicity. The HACT route is less suitable for irinotecan, since its active metabolite requires first-pass metabolism. In France, oxaliplatin is the most commonly used agent administered by HACT in combination with intravenous chemotherapy according to a 5-FU-Leucovorin protocol. The three main indications for HACT are: (1) potentially resectable HMCRC, (2) adjuvant treatment after resection of HMCRC in patients at high risk of intrahepatic recurrence, (3) palliative treatment of patients with primarily intra-hepatic disease that is definitely unresectable. In the setting of potentially resectable HMCRC, HACT can increase the chemotherapeutic response rate and improve the rate of secondary resectability. In the adjuvant setting, HACT seems to improve disease-free survival after complete resection of HMCRC in patients at high risk of intrahepatic recurrence. Finally, in the palliative setting, HACT prolongs progression-free survival, even in patients whose disease has progressed with intravenously administered oxaliplatin.", "journal": "Journal of visceral surgery", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["M-AAllard", "DMalka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2013.12.003"}

An adhesive macroporous hydrogel system, in which cell-affinitive domains and sufficient cytoskeleton reorganization space were simultaneously constructed, was proposed in this report to support cell adhesion and spreading, respectively, and facilitate cell differentiation and function establishment eventually. The adhesive macroporous alginate hydrogel was developed by RGD peptide graft and gelatin microspheres hybridization to generate cellular adhesion sites and highly interconnected macropores. The successful stretched morphology and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells in this modified alginate hydrogel showed clearly the feasibility that cell function may be effectively facilitated. Besides, this hydrogel model can be further applied to construct complex micropatterned structure, such as individual microgels in shapes of circle, square, cross and ring, and osteon-like structure containing both osteogenic and vascularized area generated by a double-ring assembly.

{"title": "Overexpression of EphB4 in the mammary epithelium shifts the differentiation pathway of progenitor cells and promotes branching activity and vascularization.", "abstract": "Postnatally, the mammary gland undergoes continuous morphogenesis and thereby is especially prone to malignant transformation. Thus, the maintenance of the epithelium depends on a tight control of stem cell recruitment. We have previously shown that epithelial overexpression of the EphB4 receptor results in defective mammary epithelial development and conferred a metastasizing tumor phenotype on experimental mouse mammary tumors accompanied by a preponderance of progenitor cells. To analyze the effect of EphB4 overexpression on mammary epithelial cell fate, we have used Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analyses to quantify epithelial sub-populations and repopulation assays of cleared fat pads to investigate their regenerative potential. These experiments revealed that deregulated EphB4 expression leads to an augmentation of bi-potent progenitor cells and to a shift of the differentiation pathway towards the luminal lineage. The analyses of the ductal outgrowths indicated that EphB4 overexpression leads to enforced branching activity, impedes ductal differentiation and stimulates angiogenesis. To elucidate the mechanisms forwarding EphB4 signals, we have compared the expression profile of defined cell populations between EphB4 transgene and wild type mammary glands concentrating on the wnt signaling pathway and on genes implicated in cell migration. With respect to wnt signaling, the progenitor cell population was the most affected, whereas the stem cell-enriched population showed the most pronounced deregulation of migration-associated genes. Thus, the luminal epithelial EphB4 signaling contributes, most likely via wnt signaling, to the regulation of migration and cell fate of early progenitors and is involved in the determination of branching points along the ductal tree.", "journal": "Development, growth & differentiation", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["PhilipKaenel", "StefanHahnewald", "CarlosWotzkow", "RobertStrange", "Anne-CatherineAndres"], "doi": "10.1111/dgd.12126"}

Blood samples were analyzed for the production of porcine and/or human inflammatory cytokines as well as complement activation products. Biopsy samples were examined for deposition of human and porcine C3b/c, C4b/c, and C6 as well as CD62E (E-selectin) and CD106 (VCAM-1) expression. Apoptosis was measured in the porcine muscle tissue using TUNEL assays. Finally, the formation of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes was measured in EDTA plasma samples.\nNo hyperacute rejection was seen in this model. Extremity perfusions lasted for up to 12\u00a0h without increase in vascular resistance and were terminated due to continuous small blood losses.

Our 9L-European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) model was developed from cells acquired at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (NY, USA) in 1997 and implanted in the right caudate nucleus of syngeneic Fisher rats. It has been largely used by the user community of the ESRF during the last decade, for imaging, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, including innovative treatments based on particular irradiation techniques and/or use of new drugs. This work presents a detailed study of its characteristics, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic analysis. The data used for this work were from rats sampled in six experiments carried out over a 3-year period in our lab (total number of rats = 142). The 9L-ESRF tumors were induced by a stereotactic inoculation of 10(4) 9L cells in the right caudate nucleus of the brain. The assessment of vascular parameters was performed by MRI (blood volume fraction and vascular size index) and by immunostaining of vessels (rat endothelial cell antigen-1 and type IV collagen). Immunohistochemistry and regular histology were used to describe features such as tumor cell infiltration, necrosis area, nuclear pleomorphism, cellularity, mitotic characteristics, leukocytic infiltration, proliferation, and inflammation. Moreover, for each of the six experiments, the survival of the animals was assessed and related to the tumor growth observed by MRI or histology. Additionally, the cytogenetic status of the 9L cells used at ESRF lab was investigated by comparative genomics hybridization analysis. Finally, the response of the 9L-ESRF tumor to radiotherapy was estimated by plotting the survival curves after irradiation. The median survival time of 9L-ESRF tumor-bearing rats was highly reproducible (19-20 days). The 9L-ESRF tumors presented a quasi-exponential growth, were highly vascularized with a high cellular density and a high proliferative index, accompanied by signs of inflammatory responses. We also report an infiltrative pattern which is poorly observed on conventional 9 L tumor. The 9L-ESRF cells presented some cytogenetic specificities such as altered regions including CDK4, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MDM2 genes. Finally, the lifespan of 9L-ESRF tumor-bearing rats was enhanced up to 28, 35, and 45 days for single doses of 10, 20, and 2 \u00d7 20 Gy, respectively. First, this report describes an animal model that is used worldwide. Second, we describe few features typical of our model if compared to other 9L models worldwide. Altogether, the 9L-ESRF tumor model presents characteristics close to the human high-grade gliomas such as high proliferative capability, high vascularization and a high infiltrative pattern.

Additional aim was to investigate any relation between the age, pack years and differences in shape, density, vascularization of fPap and sex. In 166 smokers (81 males, 85 females, age range 20-80 years), divided in age groups, electrogustometry (EGM) thresholds at the chorda tympani area, at the soft palate area and at the area of the vallate papillae were recorded bilaterally. Morphology and density of the fPap and blood vessels' density and morphology at the tip of the tongue were examined using contact endoscopy (CE). EGM thresholds of all smoking subjects tended to increase compared to the non-smoking participants. Morphology, vascularization and density of fPap were found to be worse in smokers than in non-smokers. Interestingly, some participants, despite having increased number of pack years, tended to have almost similar EGM thresholds with non-smoking subjects of the same age group. Smoking tends to affect density, morphology and vascularization of the fPap. There is a correlation between the duration of smoking (pack years) and the afore-mentioned parameters. The use of \u03c4-Kendall criterion provided useful information about the different correlation between the EGM thresholds and vascularization, the EGM thresholds and morphology of fPap and EGM thresholds and density of fPap. The majority of smokers had elevated EGM thresholds compared to non-smokers. Smoking is an important factor which can lead to decreased taste acuity.

{"title": "Acellular bi-layer silk fibroin scaffolds support tissue regeneration in a rabbit model of onlay urethroplasty.", "abstract": "Acellular scaffolds derived from Bombyx mori silk fibroin were investigated for their ability to support functional tissue regeneration in a rabbit model of urethra repair. A bi-layer silk fibroin matrix was fabricated by a solvent-casting/salt leaching process in combination with silk fibroin film casting to generate porous foams buttressed by homogeneous silk fibroin films. Ventral onlay urethroplasty was performed with silk fibroin grafts (Group 1, N = 4) (Width \u00d7 Length, 1 \u00d7 2 cm(2)) in adult male rabbits for 3 m of implantation. Parallel control groups consisted of animals receiving small intestinal submucosa (SIS) implants (Group 2, N = 4) or urethrotomy alone (Group 3, N = 3). Animals in all groups exhibited 100% survival prior to scheduled euthanasia and achieved voluntary voiding following 7 d of initial catheterization. Retrograde urethrography of each implant group at 3 m post-op revealed wide urethral calibers and preservation of organ continuity similar to pre-operative and urethrotomy controls with no evidence of contrast extravasation, strictures, fistulas, or stone formation. Histological (hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome), immunohistochemical, and histomorphometric analyses demonstrated that both silk fibroin and SIS scaffolds promoted similar extents of smooth muscle and epithelial tissue regeneration throughout the original defect sites with prominent contractile protein (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin and SM22\u03b1) and cytokeratin expression, respectively. De novo innervation and vascularization were also evident in all regenerated tissues indicated by synaptophysin-positive neuronal cells and vessels lined with CD31 expressing endothelial cells. Following 3 m post-op, minimal acute inflammatory reactions were elicited by silk fibroin scaffolds characterized by the presence of eosinophil granulocytes while SIS matrices promoted chronic inflammatory responses indicated by mobilization of mononuclear cell infiltrates. The results of this study demonstrate that bi-layer silk fibroin scaffolds represent promising biomaterials for onlay urethroplasty, capable of promoting similar degrees of tissue regeneration in comparison to conventional SIS scaffolds, but with reduced immunogenicity.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["Yeun GooChung", "DuongTu", "DebraFranck", "Eun SeokGil", "KhalidAlgarrahi", "Rosalyn MAdam", "David LKaplan", "Carlos REstrada", "Joshua RMauney"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0091592\n10.1111/j.1600-0757.2011.00408.x\n10.1097/MOU.0b013e328357bc62\n10.4103/0970-0358.105979\n10.5489/cuaj.399\n10.1016/j.urology.2013.03.081\n10.4103/0189-6725.86054\n10.1038/nrurol.2013.164\n10.1016/j.juro.2009.06.027\n10.1159/000353101\n10.4103/0970-1591.109984\n10.1111/iju.12236\n10.1016/j.urology.2011.08.043\n10.1007/s11934-013-0329-6\n10.1016/j.urology.2011.09.055\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62354-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.067\n10.1038/nprot.2011.379\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.038\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.051"}
{"title": "A novel single pulsed electromagnetic field stimulates osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and bone repair.", "abstract": "Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been successfully applied to accelerate fracture repair since 1979. Recent studies suggest that PEMF might be used as a nonoperative treatment for the early stages of osteonecrosis. However, PEMF treatment requires a minimum of ten hours per day for the duration of the treatment. In this study, we modified the protocol of the single-pulsed electromagnetic field (SPEMF) that only requires a 3-minute daily treatment. In the in vitro study, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was evaluated in the hBMSCs. In the in vivo study, new bone formation and revascularization were evaluated in the necrotic bone graft. Results from the in vitro study showed no significant cytotoxic effects on the hBMSCs after 5 days of SPEMF treatment (1 Tesla, 30 pulses per day). hBMSC proliferation was enhanced in the SPEMF-treated groups after 2 and 4 days of treatment. The osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs was significantly increased in the SPEMF-treated groups after 3-7 days of treatment. Mineralization also increased after 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of treatment in SPEMF-treated groups compared to the control group. The 7-day short-course treatment achieved similar effects on proliferation and osteogenesis as the 25-day treatment. Results from the in vivo study also demonstrated that both the 7-day and 25-day treatments of SPEMF increased callus formation around the necrotic bone and also increased new vessel formation and osteocyte numbers in the grafted necrotic bone at the 2nd and 4th weeks after surgery. In conclusion, the newly developed SPEMF accelerates osteogenic differentiation of cultured hBMSCs and enhances bone repair, neo-vascularization, and cell growth in necrotic bone in mice. The potential clinical advantage of the SPEMF is the short daily application and the shorter treatment course. We suggest that SPEMF may be used to treat fractures and the early stages of osteonecrosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-03-19", "authors": ["Yin-ChihFu", "Chih-ChunLin", "Je-KenChang", "Chung-HwanChen", "I-ChunTai", "Gwo-JawWang", "Mei-LingHo"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0091581"}

Clinically, donor-age may be within a wide spectrum; therefore, investigation of the role of donor's age on immunoregulatory potential is of critical importance to translate stem cell therapies from bench to bedside.\nAdipose and bone marrow derived MSCs (ASCs and BMSCs) were isolated in parallel from Lewis and Brown Norway rats of young (less than 4-week old) and senior groups (older than 15-month). The presentation of cells and time required for growth to 90% confluence was recorded. FACS sorting based on the expression of CD90 and CD29 double positive and CD45 CD11 double negative quantified the proportions of MSCs. After expansion, ASCs and BMSCs from different age groups were co-cultured in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR; Lewis vs. Brown Norway) assays. The suppression of CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cell populations by different sources of MSCs were compared.\nThe kinetics of cell growth was slower in old animals (17.3\u00b12days) compared with young animals (8.8\u00b13days), and cell morphology was irregular and enlarged in the senior groups. The yield of MSCs by FACS sorting was significantly higher in young groups compared to senior groups (p<0.02).

{"title": "Characterizing EPR-mediated passive drug targeting using contrast-enhanced functional ultrasound imaging.", "abstract": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is extensively used in drug delivery research. Taking into account that EPR is a highly variable phenomenon, we have here set out to evaluate if contrast-enhanced functional ultrasound (ceUS) imaging can be employed to characterize EPR-mediated passive drug targeting to tumors. Using standard fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) and two different protocols for hybrid computed tomography-fluorescence molecular tomography (CT-FMT), the tumor accumulation of a ~10 nm-sized near-infrared-fluorophore-labeled polymeric drug carrier (pHPMA-Dy750) was evaluated in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. In the same set of animals, two different ceUS techniques (2D MIOT and 3D B-mode imaging) were employed to assess tumor vascularization. Subsequently, the degree of tumor vascularization was correlated with the degree of EPR-mediated drug targeting. Depending on the optical imaging protocol used, the tumor accumulation of the polymeric drug carrier ranged from 5 to 12% of the injected dose. The degree of tumor vascularization, determined using ceUS, varied from 4 to 11%. For both hybrid CT-FMT protocols, a good correlation between the degree of tumor vascularization and the degree of tumor accumulation was observed, within the case of reconstructed CT-FMT, correlation coefficients of ~0.8 and p-values of <0.02.

In this study, we developed an amphiphilic biodegradable polymer platform for the stable encapsulation and sustained release of S1P. Mimicking the interaction between amphiphilic S1P and its binding proteins, a series of polymers with hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) core and lipophilic flanking segments of polylactide and/or poly(alkylated lactide) with different alkyl chain lengths were synthesized. These polymers were electrospun into fibrous meshes, and loaded with S1P in generally high loading efficiencies (>90%). Sustained S1P release from these scaffolds could be tuned by adjusting the alkyl chain length, blockiness and lipophilic block length, achieving 35-55% and 45-80% accumulative releases in the first 8h and by 7 days, respectively. Furthermore, using endothelial cell tube formation assay and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, we showed that the different S1P loading doses and release kinetics translated into distinct pro-angiogenic outcomes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of the thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) receptor CD36 in mediating ovarian angiogenesis and regulating ovarian function.\nThe role of CD36 was evaluated in granulosa cells in vitro and ovarian morphology and protein expression were determined in wild type and CD36 null mice.\nIn vitro, CD36 inhibition increased granulosa cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.

This implies early and high bone apposition onto the implant surface. A nanostructured coating material based on an osseoinductive bone grafting is investigated in relation to the osseointegration at early stages. The goal is to transmit the structure (silica matrix with embedded hydroxyapatite) and the properties of the bone grafting into a coating material. The bone grafting substitute offers an osseoinductive potential caused by an exchange of the silica matrix in vivo accompanied by vascularization. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analysis show that the coating material consists of a high porous silica matrix with embedded nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite with the same morphology as human hydroxyapatite. An in vitro investigation shows the early interaction between coating and human blood. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the silica matrix was replaced by an organic matrix within a few minutes.

Furthermore, the transcription factor Sox17 may act as a link between Wnt and Notch in the induction of a correct arterio/venous differentiation.\nIn the past years, the research on vascular development was mostly focused on the mechanisms that regulate vessel growth.

{"title": "Regulation of vascular endothelial junction stability and remodeling through Rap1-Rasip1 signaling.", "abstract": "The ability of blood vessels to sense and respond to stimuli such as fluid flow, shear stress, and trafficking of immune cells is critical to the proper function of the vascular system. Endothelial cells constantly remodel their cell-cell junctions and the underlying cytoskeletal network in response to these exogenous signals. This remodeling, which depends on regulation of the linkage between actin and integral junction proteins, is controlled by a complex signaling network consisting of small G proteins and their various downstream effectors. In this commentary, we summarize recent developments in understanding the small G protein RAP1 and its effector RASIP1 as critical mediators of endothelial junction stabilization, and the relationship between RAP1 effectors and modulation of different subsets of endothelial junctions. \u00a0 The vasculature is a dynamic organ that is constantly exposed to a variety of signaling stimuli and mechanical stresses. In embryogenesis, nascent blood vessels form via a process termed vasculogenesis, wherein mesodermally derived endothelial precursor cells aggregate into cords, which subsequently form a lumen that permits trafficking of plasma and erythrocytes. (1)(,) (2) Angiogenesis occurs after establishment of this primitive vascular network, where new vessels sprout from existing vessels, migrate into newly expanded tissues, and anastomose to form a functional and complex circulatory network. (1)(,) (2) In the mouse, this process occurs through the second half of embryogenesis and into postnatal development in some tissues, such as the developing retinal vasculature. (3) Further, angiogenesis occurs in a variety of pathological conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, wound healing, and tumor growth. (1)(,) (2)(,) (4) Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are driven through signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and therapeutic agents targeting this pathway have shown efficacy in a number of diseases. (5)(-) (9) Blood vessels must have a sufficient degree of integrity so as to not allow indiscriminate leak of plasma proteins and blood cells into the underlying tissue. However, vessels must be able to sense their environment, respond to local conditions, and mediate the regulated passage of protein, fluid, and cells. For example, endothelial cells are the primary point of attachment for immune cells leaving the blood stream and entering tissue, and leukocytes subsequently migrate either through the endothelial cell body itself (the transcellular route), or through transient disassembly of cell-cell junctions (the paracellular route). (10) Precise regulation of endothelial junctions is critical to the proper maintenance of vascular integrity and related processes, and disruption of vascular cell-cell contacts is an underlying cause or contributor to numerous pathologies such as cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

We report our experience leaving a single side of the reconstructed mandible unsecured to the glenoid fossa, allowing the mandible to \"hang.\" We hypothesized that a good functional recovery may be achieved with this simple approach while avoiding the potential for ankylosis and TMJ dysfunction.\nA retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing free fibula reconstruction of the mandible with condylar removal was performed. Outcomes were determined by maximum interincisal opening, occlusion, and diet after full recovery.\nSix patients were studied. Two had condylar reconstruction with a contoured fibular head secured to the glenoid fossa. One of them had progressive postoperative trismus and ankylosis. One patient was reconstructed with the native condyle rigidly fixed to the fibula flap, complicated by avascular necrosis requiring condylar resection, with good function afterward. Three patients were left to \"hang.\" All 3 had either normal or improved function after surgery.

Despite of very aggressive treatment options based on surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of affected patients has remained poor and showed only slight improvements during the last 30 years. Research on glioblastoma border zone was hindered by the tumor's intense invasion into the brain parenchyma and the lack of suitable tumor cell markers. Nevertheless, the compact tumor mass and tumor invasion zone are composed of distinct cell types that need to be distinguished from each other to be addressed selectively. As the isoform 140 of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-140) was recently demonstrated to be lost in human gliomas with rising WHO grade, human multiform glioblastomas were characterized as a NCAM-140 negative entity displaying three main distinct invasion patterns. Evaluation of putative therapy targets within the tumor tissue and tumor invasion zone has been made possible through NCAM-140 negativity. In the present study, brain tissue controls and human glioblastoma samples with compact tumor mass and invasion areas were analyzed for their vascularization at the tumor border and the expression of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR-1) within tumor tissue and vascular vessel walls. Use of NCAM-140 enabled the identification of the tumor invasion zone and its experimental investigation. Tissue vascularization was found to be significantly increased in the compact tumor mass of glioblastomas compared to their invasion zone and tumor-free controls with a significantly high and specific overexpression of PAR-1 within tumor cells and within tumor blood vessels depending upon the tumor area.

Over the years, the BPD phenotype has evolved, but despite various advances in neonatal management approaches, the reduction in the BPD burden is minimal. With the advent of surfactant, glucocorticoids, and new ventilation strategies, BPD has evolved from a disease of structural injury into a new BPD, marked by an arrest in alveolar growth in the lungs of extremely premature infants. This deficient alveolar growth has been associated with a diminution of pulmonary vasculature. Several investigators have described the epithelial / vascular co-dependency and the significant role of crosstalk between vessel formation, alveologenesis, and lung dysplasia's; hence identification and study of factors that regulate pulmonary vascular emergence and inflammation has become crucial in devising effective therapeutic approaches for this debilitating condition. The potent antiangiogenic and proinflammatory protein Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide II (EMAP II) has been described as a mediator of pulmonary vascular and alveolar formation and its expression is inversely related to the periods of vascularization and alveolarization in the developing lung. Hence the study of EMAP II could play a vital role in studying and devising appropriate therapeutics for diseases of aberrant lung development, such as BPD.

Therefore, imaging the tumor vasculature and determining its morphometric characteristics represent a critical goal for optimizing the cancer treatment that targets the blood vessels (i.e. antiangiogenesis therapy). The aim of this study was to evaluate new vascular morphometric parameters in colorectal cancer, difficult to achieve through conventional immunohistochemistry, by using the confocal laser endomicroscopy method. Fresh biopsies from tumor and normal tissue were collected during colonoscopy from five patients with T3 colorectal carcinoma without metastasis and were marked with fluorescently labeled anti-CD31 antibodies. A series of optical slices spanning 250 \u00b5m inside the tissue were immediately collected for each sample using a confocal laser endomicroscope. All measurements were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error. The mean diameter of tumor vessels was significantly larger than the normal vessels (9.46\u00b10.4 \u00b5m vs. 7.60\u00b10.3 \u00b5m, p\u200a=\u200a0.0166).

However, the role of PPAR\u03b4 in colon cancer cells in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment is not fully understood. We found that expression of the tumor-promoting cytokines, IL-8 and VEGF, induced by hypoxia (<1% O2) and deferoxamine (a hypoxia mimetic) was significantly attenuated in PPAR\u03b4-deficient HCT116 colon cancer cells. Consequently, PPAR\u03b4-knockout colon cancer cells exposed to hypoxia and deferoxamine failed to stimulate endothelial cell vascularization and macrophage migration/proliferation, whereas wild-type cells were able to induce angiogenesis and macrophage activation in response to hypoxic stress. Hypoxic stress induced transcriptional activation of PPAR\u03b4, but not its protein expression, in HCT116 cells. Exogenous expression of p300 potentiated deferoxamine-induced PPAR\u03b4 transactivation, while siRNA knockdown of p300 abolished hypoxia- and deferoxamine-induced PPAR\u03b4 transactivation. PPAR\u03b4 associated with p300 upon hypoxic stress as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation studies. PI3K inhibitors or siRNA knockdown of Akt suppressed the PPAR\u03b4 transactivation induced by hypoxia and deferoxamine in HCT116 cells, leading to decreased expression of IL-8 and VEGF. Collectively, these results reveal that PPAR\u03b4 is required for hypoxic stress-mediated cytokine expression in colon cancer cells, resulting in promotion of angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and macrophage proliferation in the tumor microenvironment. p300 and the PI3K/Akt pathway play a role in the regulation of PPAR\u03b4 transactivation induced by hypoxic stress.

Two of these targets, the fornix and subgenual cingulate white matter (SgCwm) tracts, were further investigated using a computational modeling framework that combined segmented volumes of the vascularized brain, finite element models of the tissue voltage during DBS, and multi-compartment axon models to predict the direct electrophysiological effects of endovascular DBS.\nThe models showed that: (1) a ring-electrode conforming to the vessel wall was more efficient at neural activation than a guidewire design, (2) increasing the length of a ring-electrode had minimal effect on neural activation thresholds, (3) large variability in neural activation occurred with suboptimal placement of a ring-electrode along the targeted vessel, and (4) activation thresholds for the fornix and SgCwm tracts were comparable for endovascular and stereotactic DBS, though endovascular DBS was able to produce significantly larger contralateral activation for a unilateral implantation.\nTogether, these results suggest that endovascular DBS can serve as a complementary approach to stereotactic DBS in select cases.", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "date": "2014-03-13", "authors": ["Benjamin ATeplitzky", "Allison TConnolly", "Jawad ABajwa", "Matthew DJohnson"], "doi": "10.1088/1741-2560/11/2/026011"}
{"title": "Biodegradable gelatin microspheres enhance the neuroprotective potency of osteopontin via quick and sustained release in the post-ischemic brain.", "abstract": "Gelatin microspheres (GMSs) are widely used as drug carriers owing to their excellent biocompatibilities and toxicologically safe degradation products. The drug release profile is easily tailored by controlling the cross-linking density and surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. size, of the GMS. In this study, we employed GMSs which are 25 \u03bcm in diameter and cross-linked with 0.03125% glutaraldehyde, to enable rapid initial and a subsequent sustained release. Therapeutic potency of human recombinant osteopontin (rhOPN) with or without encapsulation into GMSs was investigated after administrating them to rat stroke model (Sprague-Dawley; middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO). The administration of rhOPN/GMS (100 ng/100 \u03bcg) at 1h post-MCAO reduced the mean infarct volume by 81.8% of that of the untreated MCAO control and extended the therapeutic window at least to 12h post-MCAO, demonstrating a markedly enhanced therapeutic potency for the use of OPN in the post-ischemic brain. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs revealed that GMSs maintained the three-dimensional shape for more than 5 days in normal brain but were degraded rapidly in the post-ischemic brain, presumably due to high levels of gelatinase induction. After encapsulation with GMS, the duration of OPN release was markedly extended; from the period of 2 days to 5 days in normal brain, and from 2 days to 4 days in the post-ischemic brain; these encompass the critical period for recovery processes, such as vascularization, and controlling inflammation. Together, these results indicate that GMS-mediated drug delivery has huge potential when it was used in the hyperacute period in the post-ischemic brain.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-03-13", "authors": ["YinchuanJin", "In-YongKim", "Il-DooKim", "Hye-KyungLee", "Jin-YoungPark", "Pyung-LimHan", "Kyekyoon KevinKim", "HyungsooChoi", "Ja-KyeongLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.045"}
{"title": "Assessment of inhibited alveolar-capillary membrane structural development and function in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.", "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of extreme prematurity and is defined clinically by dependence on supplemental oxygen due to impaired gas exchange. Optimal gas exchange is dependent on the development of a sufficient surface area for diffusion. In the mammalian lung, rapid acquisition of distal lung surface area is accomplished in neonatal and early adult life by means of vascularization and secondary septation of distal lung airspaces. Extreme preterm birth interrupts secondary septation and pulmonary capillary development and ultimately reduces the efficiency of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Although pulmonary health in BPD infants rapidly improves over the first few years, persistent alveolar-capillary membrane dysfunction continues into adolescence and adulthood. Preventative therapies have been largely ineffective, and therapies aimed at promoting normal development of the air-blood barrier in infants with established BPD remain largely unexplored. The purpose of this review will be: (1) to summarize the histological evidence of aberrant alveolar-capillary membrane development associated with extreme preterm birth and BPD, (2) to review the clinical evidence assessing the long-term impact of BPD on alveolar-capillary membrane function, and (3) to discuss the need to develop and incorporate direct measurements of functional gas exchange into clinically relevant animal models of inhibited alveolar development.", "journal": "Birth defects research.

Plastic adherent fibroblastoid cell populations with distinctive homogeneous morphology were isolated from caprine Wharton's jelly explants. These Wharton's jelly derived cells were found positive for the surface markers CD-73, STRO-1 and CD-105, whereas they were negative for hematopoetic stem cell marker CD-34. In vitro cultured cWJ-MSCs also showed differentiation properties into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages as demonstrated by von Kossa, Oil Red-O and Alcian blue staining respectively, which was further confirmed and quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, these well characterized cWJ-MSCs were evaluated for the wound-healing potential in full-thickness skin wounds in rabbit model for 28 days. Caprine WJ- MSCs treated skin wounds showed significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) higher percentage of wound contraction especially at the 21(st) day post transplantation when compared to PBS treated control group animals. Further, we observed better healing potential of cWJ-MSCs in terms of histo-morphological evaluation, epithelialisation and collagenization with matured vascularization stage by day 28 as compared to control. In conclusion, cWJ- MSCs provide an alternative inexhaustible source of mesenchymal stem cells and also unravel new perspectives pertaining to the therapeutic use of these cells in different species.", "journal": "Veterinary research communications", "date": "2014-03-08", "authors": ["M DPratheesh", "Nitin EGade", "Pawan KDubey", "AmarNath", "T BSivanarayanan", "D NMadhu", "BhaskarSharma", "NoneAmarpal", "GSaikumar", "G TaruSharma"], "doi": "10.1007/s11259-014-9597-y"}

Reconstructed MDCT studies were assessed to determine the hepatic arterial configuration (origin of every hepatic arterial branch, branching pattern and anatomical course) and the hepatic segmental vascularization territory of all branches. Aberrant hepatic arteries were defined as hepatic arterial branches that did not originate from the celiac axis/CHA/PHA. Early branching patterns were defined as hepatic arterial branches originating from the celiac axis/CHA.\nThe hepatic arterial configuration and segmental vascularization pattern could be assessed in 110 of 133 patients.

The expression and function of the longer transcripts namely the long noncoding RNAs in the vasculature are largely unknown.\nHere, we characterized the expression of long noncoding RNAs in human endothelial cells and elucidated the function of the highly expressed metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1).\nEndothelial cells of different origin express relative high levels of the conserved long noncoding RNAs MALAT1, taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), linc00657, and linc00493. MALAT1 was significantly increased by hypoxia and controls a phenotypic switch in endothelial cells. Silencing of MALAT1 by small interfering RNAs or GapmeRs induced a promigratory response and increased basal sprouting and migration, whereas proliferation of endothelial cells was inhibited. When angiogenesis was further stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, MALAT1 small interfering RNAs induced discontinuous sprouts indicative of defective proliferation of stalk cells. In vivo studies confirmed that genetic ablation of MALAT1 inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells and reduced neonatal retina vascularization. Pharmacological inhibition of MALAT1 by GapmeRs reduced blood flow recovery and capillary density after hindlimb ischemia. Gene expression profiling followed by confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that silencing of MALAT1 impaired the expression of various cell cycle regulators.\nSilencing of MALAT1 tips the balance from a proliferative to a migratory endothelial cell phenotype in vitro, and its genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition reduces vascular growth in vivo.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2014-03-08", "authors": ["Katharina MMichalik", "XintianYou", "YosifManavski", "AnuradhaDoddaballapur", "MartinZ\u00f6rnig", "ThomasBraun", "DavidJohn", "YuliyaPonomareva", "WeiChen", "ShizukaUchida", "Reinier ABoon", "StefanieDimmeler"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303265"}

Thanks to newer ultrasound contrast agents, CEUS has become a well-established, live-imaging technique in many contexts, but it has never been used extensively for brain imaging. The use of intraoperative CEUS (iCEUS) imaging in neurosurgery is limited.\nTo provide the first dynamic and continuous iCEUS evaluation of a variety of brain lesions.\nWe evaluated 71 patients undergoing iCEUS imaging in an off-label setting while being operated on for different brain lesions; iCEUS imaging was obtained before resecting each lesion, after intravenous injection of ultrasound contrast agent. A semiquantitative, offline interobserver analysis was performed to visualize each brain lesion and to characterize its perfusion features, correlated with histopathology.\nIn all cases, the brain lesion was visualized intraoperatively with iCEUS. The afferent and efferent blood vessels were identified, allowing evaluation of the time and features of the arterial and venous phases and facilitating the surgical strategy. iCEUS also proved to be useful in highlighting the lesion compared with standard B-mode imaging and showing its perfusion patterns. No adverse effects were observed.\nOur study is the first large-scale implementation of iCEUS in neurosurgery as a dynamic and continuous real-time imaging tool for brain surgery and provides the first iCEUS characterization of different brain neoplasms.

This study investigates the ability of clinical, cytological and sonographic data to predict malignancy in indeterminate nodules with the scope of determining the need for total thyroidectomy in these patients.\nThe study population consisted of 249 cases presenting indeterminate nodules (Thy3): 198 females (79.5%) and 51 males (20.5%) with a mean age of 52.43\u2009\u00b1\u200913.68 years.

Of the sonographic characteristics, only echogenicity and the presence of irregular margins were identified as being statistically significant predictors of malignancy. 52/162 benign lesions (32.1%) and 54/87 malignant were hypoechoic (62.07%); irregular margins were present in 13/162 benign lesions (8.02%), and in 60/87 malignant lesions (68.97%).

Thus, considering the fact that clinical and cytological features were found to be inaccurate predictors of malignancy, it is our opinion that surgery should always be recommended. Moreover, total thyroidectomy is advisable, being the most suitable procedure in cases of multiple lesions, hyperplastic nodular goiter, or thyroiditis; the high incidence of malignancy and the unreliability of intraoperative frozen section examination also support this preference for total over hemi-thyroidectomy.", "journal": "BMC surgery", "date": "2014-03-07", "authors": ["Pietro GiorgioCal\u00f2", "FabioMedas", "RosaSanta Cruz", "FrancescoPodda", "EnricoErdas", "GiuseppePisano", "AngeloNicolosi"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2482-14-12\n10.1056/NEJMoa1203208\n10.1308/147870811X565232\n10.1089/thy.2008.0200\n10.1089/thy.2008.0338\n10.1089/thy.2005.15.583\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050725\n10.1002/jcp.24242\n10.1530/EJE-13-0431\n10.1111/j.1365-2265.2007.03158.x\n10.1002/dc.10043\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2004.07.006\n10.1002/dc.21136\n10.1111/j.1365-2265.2006.02625.x\n10.1530/eje.1.02020\n10.1111/j.1365-2265.2012.04427.x\n10.1530/ERC-13-0157\n10.1530/EJE-11-0181\n10.1210/jc.2011-1469\n10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2010.08.020\n10.1007/s12020-013-9877-2"}

However, the teeth grafts were fully covered by new bone by the sixth month. The radiograph demonstrated the progressive change in the bone and grafted tooth interface from radiolucency to radiopacity during different time periods. Histologically, vascularization led to a temporary fibrous integration in the graft-bone interface. The bone contact rate of 1 and 3 months was significantly lower than that of the 6 months.

Transplantation of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a promising tool for regenerating the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and efficacy of transplantation of cultured autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs mixed with \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) in combination with vascularized bone grafts for the treatment of advanced stage ION in a clinical trial.

{"title": "Adipogenic factor-loaded microspheres increase retention of transplanted adipose tissue.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop and test a controlled delivery system of two adipogenic factors (insulin and dexamethasone [Dex]), to generate stable adipose tissue when mixed with disaggregated human fat.

It was hypothesized that the slow release of insulin and Dex would enhance both adipogenesis and angiogenesis, thus retaining the fat graft volume in a nude mouse model. Insulin/Dex-loaded PLGA MS (Insulin/Dex MS) were prepared using both single and double emulsion/solvent extraction techniques. The bioactivity of the drugs was assessed by mixing the MS with human lipoaspirate and injecting subcutaneously into the dorsal aspect of an athymic mouse. Five doses of the drugs were examined and samples were analyzed grossly and histologically after 5 weeks in vivo. Mass and volume of the grafts were measured with the microsphere-containing samples, demonstrating increased mass and volume with increasing drug doses. Histological analysis, including H&E and CD31, indicated increased vascularization within the insulin/Dex MS-containing samples compared with the lipoaspirate-only samples.

In vitro prevascularization of engineered tissues has been explored as a potential solution to this challenge. The traditional paradigm of in vitro prevascularization is to implant an engineered tissue with a preformed vascular network that is perfused after anastomosis with the host circulation. We investigated the efficacy of this strategy by implanting cell-dense prevascularized tissues created via cell-mediated contraction and composed of collagen and a collagen-fibrin mixture into dorsal window chambers surgically prepared on immunocompromised mice. We found that host-implant anastomosis takes place in 2-6 days and that perfusion of vessels within the implants is subsequently restricted by thrombosis. However, by day 7, a functional vascular network composed of host and implant vessels developed. Prevascularization enhanced intra-implant pO2 significantly as early as 2 days postimplantation, reaching a maximum of 55 mmHg by day 8, which was significantly greater than the maximum within cellularized control tissues (18 mmHg).

We developed a large animal critical-sized mandibular defect model in which osseous free fibula flaps were used for reconstruction.In this study a total of eight 3-month-old Yorkshire pigs underwent 6 cm full-thickness resection of the left hemimandible. An osseous free fibula flap from the left leg was harvested and contoured to the mandibular defect. Bone placement and plate position was confirmed with fluoroscopy. Animals were followed with serial radiographs and clinical evaluations.Free fibulas were transferred successfully in all eight animals. The average operative time was 346 minutes, and the average flap ischemia time was 86 minutes.

{"title": "Novel insights into the development and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier.", "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system (CNS) and is a prerequisite for proper neuronal function. The BBB is localized to microvascular endothelial cells that strictly control the passage of metabolites into and out of the CNS. Complex and continuous tight junctions and lack of fenestrae combined with low pinocytotic activity make the BBB endothelium a tight barrier for water soluble moleucles. In combination with its expression of specific enzymes and transport molecules, the BBB endothelium is unique and distinguishable from all other endothelial cells in the body. During embryonic development, the CNS is vascularized by angiogenic sprouting from vascular networks originating outside of the CNS in a precise spatio-temporal manner. The particular barrier characteristics of BBB endothelial cells are induced during CNS angiogenesis by cross-talk with cellular and acellular elements within the developing CNS. In this review, we summarize the currently known cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating brain angiogenesis and introduce more recently discovered CNS-specific pathways (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Norrin/Frizzled4 and hedgehog) and molecules (GPR124) that are crucial in BBB differentiation and maturation. Finally, based on observations that BBB dysfunction is associated with many human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and brain tumors, we discuss recent insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining barrier characteristics in the mature BBB endothelium.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["BrittaEngelhardt", "StefanLiebner"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-014-1811-2"}
{"title": "The role of macrophage phenotype in vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is crucial for the success of most tissue engineering strategies. The natural inflammatory response is a major regulator of vascularization, through the activity of different types of macrophages and the cytokines they secrete. Macrophages exist on a spectrum of diverse phenotypes, from \"classically activated\" M1 to \"alternatively activated\" M2 macrophages. M2 macrophages, including the subsets M2a and M2c, are typically considered to promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, while M1 macrophages are considered to be anti-angiogenic, although these classifications are controversial. Here we show that in contrast to this traditional paradigm, primary human M1 macrophages secrete the highest levels of potent angiogenic stimulators including VEGF; M2a macrophages secrete the highest levels of PDGF-BB, a chemoattractant for stabilizing pericytes, and also promote anastomosis of sprouting endothelial cells in\u00a0vitro; and M2c macrophages secrete the highest levels of MMP9, an important protease involved in vascular remodeling. In a murine subcutaneous implantation model, porous collagen scaffolds were surrounded by a fibrous capsule, coincident with high expression of M2 macrophage markers, while scaffolds coated with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide were degraded by inflammatory macrophages, and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked scaffolds were infiltrated by substantial numbers of blood vessels, accompanied by high levels of M1 and M2 macrophages. These results suggest that coordinated efforts by both M1 and M2 macrophages are required for angiogenesis and scaffold vascularization, which may explain some of the controversy over which phenotype is the angiogenic phenotype.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["Kara LSpiller", "Rachel RAnfang", "Krista JSpiller", "JohnathanNg", "Kenneth RNakazawa", "Jeffrey WDaulton", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.012"}

These adhesions are frustrating and potentially fatal, representing a major postoperative complication in abdominal surgery. It is estimated that 32% of horses undergoing laparotomy will present clinical symptoms due to adhesions, but the true prevalence is not known because a large proportion of animals with postoperative recurrent colics are medically treated or submitted to euthanasia without necropsy. Adhesions are highly cellular, vascularized, dynamic structures that are influenced by complex signaling mechanisms. Understanding their pathogenesis could assist in applying better therapeutic strategies and in developing more effective antiadhesion products. Currently, there are no definitive strategies that prevent adhesion formation, and it is difficult to interpret the results of existing studies due to nonstandardization of an induction model and evaluation of their severity. The best clinical results have been obtained from using minimally traumatic surgical techniques, anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobials, anticoagulants, and mechanical separation of serosal surfaces by viscous intraperitoneal solutions or physical barriers.

{"title": "Optimizing recellularization of whole decellularized heart extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "Perfusion decellularization of cadaveric hearts removes cells and generates a cell-free extracellular matrix scaffold containing acellular vascular conduits, which are theoretically sufficient to perfuse and support tissue-engineered heart constructs. However, after transplantation, these acellular vascular conduits clot, even with anti-coagulation. Here, our objective was to create a less thrombogenic scaffold and improve recellularized-left ventricular contractility by re-lining vascular conduits of a decellularized rat heart with rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs).\nWe used three strategies to recellularize perfusion-decellularized rat heart vasculature with RAECs: retrograde aortic infusion, brachiocephalic artery (BA) infusion, or a combination of inferior vena cava (IVC) plus BA infusion. The re-endothelialized scaffolds were maintained under vascular flow in vitro for 7 days, and then cell morphology, location, and viability were examined. Thrombogenicity of the scaffold was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Both BA and IVC+BA cell delivery resulted in a whole heart distribution of RAECs that proliferated, retained an endothelial phenotype, and expressed endothelial nitric oxide synthase and von Willebrand factor. Infusing RAECs via the combination IVC+BA method increased scaffold cellularity and the number of vessels that were lined with endothelial cells; re-endothelialization by using BA or IVC+BA cell delivery significantly reduced in vitro thrombogenicity. In vivo, both acellular and re-endothelialized scaffolds recruited non-immune host cells into the organ parenchyma and vasculature. Finally, re-endothelialization before recellularization of the left ventricular wall with neonatal cardiac cells enhanced construct contractility.\nThis is the first study to re-endothelialize whole decellularized hearts throughout both arterial and venous beds and cavities by using arterial and venous delivery. The combination (IVC+BA) delivery strategy results in enhanced scaffold vessel re-endothelialization compared to single-route strategies. Re-endothelialization reduced scaffold thrombogencity and improved contractility of left ventricular-recellularized constructs. Thus, vessel and cavity re-endothelialization creates superior vascularized scaffolds for use in whole-organ recellularization applications.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-03-04", "authors": ["Matthew JRobertson", "Jessica LDries-Devlin", "Stefan MKren", "Jana SBurchfield", "Doris ATaylor"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0090406"}

Prevention of this life-threatening event can be achieved pharmacologically or mechanically with intravascular filter systems. The ability to evaluate the risk of embolization of certain techniques and procedures in vascular and microvascular surgery, such as, tissue glue or fibrin based haemostatic agents lacks convincing models. We performed 64 microvascular anastomoses in 44 rats, including 44 micro-pore polyurethane filter-anastomoses and 20 non-filter anastomoses. The rats were re-anesthetized and the aorta was re-exposed and removed four hours, three, seven, fourteen, thirty-one days, and six months postoperatively. The specimens were examined macro- and microscopically with regard to the appearance of the vessel wall, condition of the filter and the amount of thrombembolic material. Typical postoperative histopathological changes in vessel architecture were observed. Media necrosis was the first significant change three days postoperatively. Localized intimal hyperplasia, media necrosis, increase of media fibromyocytes and adventitial hypercellularity were seen to a significant extent at day seven postoperatively. Significant neovascularization of adventitia adjacent to the filter was seen after 14 days. A significant amount of thrombotic material was seen after four hours, three and 14 days interval. Only three intravascular filters became completely occluded (6.82%). The aorta-filter-anastomosis model appeared to be a valid in-vivo model in situations at risk for thrombembolic events, for microsurgical research and allowed sensitive analysis of surgical procedures and protection of the vascularized tissue.

In its most typical form it is characterized by the presence of hypertelorism, bifid uvula/cleft palate and aortic aneurysm and/or arterial tortuosity. LDS is caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the genes encoding TGF\u03b2 receptor 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and -2), which lead to a paradoxical increase in TGF\u03b2 signaling. To address this apparent paradox and to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of aneurysmal disease, we characterized a new Tgfbr1 mouse model carrying a p.Y378* nonsense mutation. Study of the natural history in this model showed that homozygous mutant mice die during embryonic development due to defective vascularization. Heterozygous mutant mice aged 6 and 12 months were morphologically and (immuno)histochemically indistinguishable from wild-type mice. We show that the mutant allele is degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay, expected to result in haploinsufficiency of the mutant allele. Since this haploinsufficiency model does not result in cardiovascular malformations, it does not allow further study of the process of aneurysm formation.

{"title": "The ubiquitin ligase ASB4 promotes trophoblast differentiation through the degradation of ID2.", "abstract": "Vascularization of the placenta is a critical developmental process that ensures fetal viability. Although the vascular health of the placenta affects both maternal and fetal well being, relatively little is known about the early stages of placental vascular development. The ubiquitin ligase Ankyrin repeat, SOCS box-containing 4 (ASB4) promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation to vascular lineages and is highly expressed early in placental development. The transcriptional regulator Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) negatively regulates vascular differentiation during development and is a target of many ubiquitin ligases. Due to their overlapping spatiotemporal expression pattern in the placenta and contrasting effects on vascular differentiation, we investigated whether ASB4 regulates ID2 through its ligase activity in the placenta and whether this activity mediates vascular differentiation. In mouse placentas, ASB4 expression is restricted to a subset of cells that express both stem cell and endothelial markers. Placentas that lack Asb4 display immature vascular patterning and retain expression of placental progenitor markers, including ID2 expression. Using JAR placental cells, we determined that ASB4 ubiquitinates and represses ID2 expression in a proteasome-dependent fashion. Expression of ASB4 in JAR cells and primary isolated trophoblast stem cells promotes the expression of differentiation markers. In functional endothelial co-culture assays, JAR cells ectopically expressing ASB4 increased endothelial cell turnover and stabilized endothelial tube formation, both of which are hallmarks of vascular differentiation within the placenta. Co-transfection of a degradation-resistant Id2 mutant with Asb4 inhibits both differentiation and functional responses. Lastly, deletion of Asb4 in mice induces a pathology that phenocopies human pre-eclampsia, including hypertension and proteinuria in late-stage pregnant females. These results indicate that ASB4 mediates vascular differentiation in the placenta via its degradation of ID2.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-03-04", "authors": ["W H DavinTownley-Tilson", "YaxuWu", "James EFerguson", "CamPatterson"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0089451"}

Female llamas with a growing follicle of 8 mm or greater in diameter were assigned randomly to one of three groups (n = 10 llamas per group) and given a single intramuscular dose of PBS (1 mL), GnRH (50 \u03bcg), or purified OIF/NGF (1.0 mg). Cineloops of ultrasonographic images of the ovary containing the dominant follicle were recorded in brightness and power Doppler modalities. Llamas were examined every 4 hours from the day of treatment (Day 0) until ovulation, and every other day thereafter to Day 16. Still frames were extracted from cineloops for computer-assisted analysis of the vascular area of the preovulatory follicle from treatment to ovulation and of the growing and regressing phases of subsequent CL development. Blood samples were collected for the measurement of plasma LH and progesterone concentrations. The diameter of the dominant follicle at the time of treatment did not differ among groups (P = 0.48).

{"title": "Cardiac responses to elevated seawater temperature in Atlantic salmon.", "abstract": "Atlantic salmon aquaculture operations in the Northern hemisphere experience large seasonal fluctuations in seawater temperature. With summer temperatures often peaking around 18-20\u00b0C there is growing concern about the effects on fish health and performance. Since the heart has a major role in the physiological plasticity and acclimation to different thermal conditions in fish, we wanted to investigate how three and eight weeks exposure of adult Atlantic salmon to 19\u00b0C, previously shown to significantly reduce growth performance, affected expression of relevant genes and proteins in cardiac tissues under experimental conditions.\nTranscriptional responses in cardiac tissues after three and eight weeks exposure to 19\u00b0C (compared to thermal preference, 14\u00b0C) were analyzed with cDNA microarrays and validated by expression analysis of selected genes and proteins using real-time qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. Up-regulation of heat shock proteins and cell signaling genes may indicate involvement of the unfolded protein response in long-term acclimation to elevated temperature. Increased immunofluorescence staining of inducible nitric oxide synthase in spongy and compact myocardium as well as increased staining of vascular endothelial growth factor in epicardium could reflect induced vascularization and vasodilation, possibly related to increased oxygen demand. Increased staining of collagen I in the compact myocardium of 19\u00b0C fish may be indicative of a remodeling of connective tissue with long-term warm acclimation. Finally, higher abundance of transcripts for genes involved in innate cellular immunity and lower abundance of transcripts for humoral immune components implied altered immune competence in response to elevated temperature.\nLong-term exposure of Atlantic salmon to 19\u00b0C resulted in cardiac gene and protein expression changes indicating that the unfolded protein response, vascularization, remodeling of connective tissue and altered innate immune responses were part of the cardiac acclimation or response to elevated temperature.", "journal": "BMC physiology", "date": "2014-03-04", "authors": ["Sven MartinJ\u00f8rgensen", "VicenteCastro", "AlekseiKrasnov", "JacobTorgersen", "GerritTimmerhaus", "Ernst MortenHevr\u00f8y", "Tom JohnnyHansen", "SisselSusort", "OlavBreck", "HaraldTakle"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6793-14-2\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02380.x\n10.1139/Z09-092\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024464\n10.1242/jeb.00547\n10.1242/jeb.01057\n10.1242/jeb.019281\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.10.037\n10.1128/JVI.02154-10\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037269\n10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.10.007\n10.1016/j.cbd.2010.04.006\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1186/1471-2164-12-459\n10.1093/nar/30.9.e36\n10.1242/jeb.01488\n10.1016/j.aquatox.2004.03.019\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.025\n10.1007/s00360-012-0704-5\n10.1086/669265\n10.1242/jeb.080556\n10.1242/jeb.00707\n10.1016/j.niox.2008.10.006\n10.1016/j.cbpb.2005.05.051\n10.1038/35025215\n10.1139/z88-351\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-205\n10.1016/0145-305X(94)90252-6\n10.1007/BF02112361\n10.1016/j.dci.2003.10.003"}

Nonabsorbable sutures may cause various reactions, including granuloma reactions, both sterile and inflammatory.\nThe aim of the study was to analyze prospective ultrasound examinations of the abdominal integuments in order to detect tissue reactions to surgical sutures.\nFor 10 years, ultrasound examinations of the abdominal integuments involved the assessment of surgical scars in all patients who underwent open or closed surgeries for various reasons (in total 2254 patients). Ultrasound examinations were performed only with the use of linear probes with the frequency ranging from 7 to 12 MHz. Each scar in the abdominal integuments was scanned in at least two planes. When a lesion was detected, the image was enlarged and the transducer was rotated by approximately 180\u00b0 in order to capture the dimensions of the granuloma and the most characteristic image of the suture. Moreover, vascularization of the lesion was also assessed with the use of color Doppler mode set to detect the lowest flows.\nAll granulomas (19 lesions, two in one patient) created hypoechoic oval or round nodules, were relatively well-circumscribed and their size ranged from 8 \u00d7 4 mm to 40 \u00d7 14 mm. In the center of the lesion, it was possible to notice a thread that was coiled to various degrees and presented itself as a double, curved hyperechoic line. In 9 out of 19 granulomas, slight peripheral vascularization was observed. The substantial majority of the lesions (n = 15) were in contact with the fascia. In seven patients, compression with the transducer induced known local pain (n = 4) or intensified pain that had already been present (n = 3); all of these granulomas infiltrated the fascia and showed slight peripheral vascularization. Cutaneous fistulae developed in two patients with purulent reactions to the running stitch (in one patient - two fistulae).\nSuture granulomas in the abdominal integuments manifest themselves as nodular hypoechoic lesions, usually localized at the edge of the fascia - subcutaneous fat. A pathognomonic sign of this type of granulomas is the presence of a thread in their center that usually manifests itself as a chaotically shaped, double hyperechoic line.

{"title": "Combined blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 by telmisartan effectively inhibits vascularization and growth of murine endometriosis-like lesions.", "abstract": "Is telmisartan effective in the treatment of endometriosis?\nCombined blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 by telmisartan inhibits vascularization and growth of murine endometriosis-like lesions.\nAT1R and PPAR-\u03b3 are involved in the regulation of inflammation, proliferation and angiogenesis. These processes are also crucial for the pathogenesis of endometriosis and both receptors are expressed in endometrial tissue. Telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR-\u03b3, which additionally blocks AT1R.\nThis was a randomized study in the mouse dorsal skinfold chamber and peritoneal model of endometriosis. Endometriosis-like lesions were induced in dorsal skinfold chambers of 21 female C57BL/6 mice, and in the peritoneal cavity of 15 additional animals, which were daily treated with an i.p. injection of pioglitazone (10 mg/kg, n = 12), telmisartan (10 mg/kg, n = 12) or vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), n = 12) throughout an observation period of 14 and 28 days, respectively.\nThe anti-angiogenic actions of pioglitazone, a full PPAR-\u03b3 agonist, and telmisartan were firstly assessed in vitro by an aortic ring assay. Endometriosis-like lesions were induced in the dorsal skinfold chamber or peritoneal cavity and the effects of telmisartan and pioglitazone on their vascularization, immune cell content and growth were studied by intravital fluorescence microscopy, high-resolution ultrasound imaging as well as histological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses. Additional quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) arrays served for gene expression profiling of the lesions. To limit the role of chance, the experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with appropriate vehicle-treated controls. Statistical significance was accepted for a value of P < 0.05.\nTelmisartan inhibited vascular sprout formation of aortic rings more effectively than pioglitazone. Accordingly, endometriosis-like lesions in dorsal skinfold chambers of telmisartan-treated animals exhibited a markedly lower functional microvessel density and blood perfusion. High-resolution ultrasound analyses of peritoneal endometriosis-like lesions revealed that the compound inhibited the stromal tissue growth, resulting in a significantly reduced final lesion volume. In contrast, the development of cysts did not differ between the groups. Moreover, telmisartan induced an up-regulation of PPAR-\u03b3 and a down-regulation of AT1R proteins in endometriosis-like lesions, which was associated with a decreased density of CD31-positive microvessels, a reduced immune cell content and a lower number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells. qRT-PCR arrays further demonstrated an inhibitory action of telmisartan on the expression of several angiogenic and inflammatory genes.\nEndometriosis-like lesions were induced by syngeneic tissue transplantation into recipient mice without the use of pathological endometriotic tissue of human nature. Therefore, the results obtained in this study may not fully relate to human patients with endometriosis.\nThis study demonstrates that telmisartan inhibits vascularization, immune cell content and growth of endometriosis-like lesions. Accordingly, the combined blockade of AT1R and activation of PPAR-\u03b3 represents a promising new concept in the development of novel compounds for the treatment of endometriosis.\nThere was no specific funding of this study.

{"title": "Islet-1 overexpression in human mesenchymal stem cells promotes vascularization through monocyte chemoattractant protein-3.", "abstract": "The LIM-homeobox transcription factor islet-1 (ISL1) has been proposed to mark a cardiovascular progenitor cell lineage that gives rise to cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether forced expression of ISL1 in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) influenced the differentiation capacity and angiogenic properties of hMSCs. The lentiviral vector, EF1\u03b1-ISL1, was constructed using the Multisite Gateway System and used to transduce hMSCs. We found that ISL1 overexpression did not alter the proliferation, migration, or survival of hMSCs or affect their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, or endotheliocytes. However, ISL1-hMSCs differentiated into smooth muscle cells more efficiently than control hMSCs. Furthermore, conditioned medium from ISL1-hMSCs greatly enhanced the survival, migration, and tube-formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In vivo angiogenesis assays also showed much more vascular-like structures in the group cotransplanted with ISL1-hMSCs and HUVECs than in the group cotransplanted with control hMSCs and HUVECs. Quantitative RT-PCR and antibody arrays detected monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP3) at a higher level in conditioned medium from ISL1-hMSCs cultures than in conditioned medium from control hMSCs. Neutralization assays showed that addition of an anti-MCP3 antibody to ISL1-hMSCs-conditioned medium efficiently abolished the angiogenesis-promoting effect of ISL1-hMSCs. Our data suggest that overexpression of ISL1 in hMSCs promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through increasing secretion of paracrine factors, smooth muscle differentiation ability, and enhancing the survival of HUVECs.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2014-03-01", "authors": ["JiaLiu", "WeiqiangLi", "YinfenWang", "WendongFan", "PanlongLi", "WanyiLin", "DayaYang", "RongFang", "MingzheFeng", "ChenghengHu", "ZhiminDu", "GuifuWu", "Andy PengXiang"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.1682"}

{"title": "In vivo bioluminescent tracking of mesenchymal stem cells within large hydrogel constructs.", "abstract": "The use of multicomponent scaffolds for cell implantation has necessitated sophisticated techniques for tracking of cell survival in vivo. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) has emerged as a noninvasive tool for evaluating the therapeutic potential of cell-based tissue engineering strategies. However, the ability to use BLI measurements to longitudinally assess large 3D cellular constructs in vivo and the effects of potential confounding factors are poorly understood. In this study, luciferase-expressing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were delivered subcutaneously within agarose and RGD-functionalized alginate hydrogel vehicles to investigate the impact of construct composition and tissue formation on BLI signal. Results showed that alginate constructs exhibited twofold greater BLI counts than agarose constructs at comparable hMSC doses. However, each hydrogel type produced a linear correlation between BLI counts and live cell number, indicating that within a given material, relative differences in cell number could be accurately assessed at early time points. The survival efficiency of delivered hMSCs was highest for the lower cell doses embedded within alginate matrix. BLI signal remained predictive of live cell number through 1 week in vivo, although the strength of correlation decreased over time. Irrespective of hydrogel type or initial hMSC seeding dose, all constructs demonstrated a degree of vascularization and development of a fibrotic capsule after 1 week. Formation of tissue within and adjacent to the constructs was accompanied by an attenuation of BLI signal during the initial period of the image acquisition time-frame. In alginate constructs only, greater vessel volume led to a delayed rise in BLI signal following luciferin delivery. This study identified vascular and fibrotic tissue ingrowth as potential confounding variables for longitudinal BLI studies.

A selected gene panel for endothelial and osteoblastic differentiation as well as genes that can affect MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were investigated. Moreover, gene expression profile of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog transcription factors was assessed. Our results showed that under growth factor stimulation PDPCs are induced toward an osteoblastic differentiation, while S-MSCs seem to move along an endothelial phenotype. This different commitment seems to be linked to a diverse MAPK or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation. The analysis of genes for stemness evidenced that at least in PDPCs multipotency and differentiation could coexist.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been used both in vitro and in vivo to promote angiogenesis but due to its short half-life its controlled delivery is a sought after method. In this study we present a new concept of degradable drug loaded nanoparticles entrapped into exponentially growing multilayer films. Through hydrolysis of the nanoparticles, the drug can be delivered over long periods in a controlled manner. Poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) nanoparticles were loaded with VEGF and in turn the release of VEGF from a surface is controlled by a thick layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte film. Direct loading of VEGF inside the film was not efficient for long-term applications. When VEGF loaded nanoparticles were introduced into the film, the particles were equally distributed inside and were stable after several washes. Moreover, the presence of the film sustained the release of VEGF for 7 days. Addition of the nanoparticles to the film promoted endothelial cell proliferation, mainly due to the presence of VEGF. Mechanical properties of the film (Young's moduli) were also improved by the presence of nanoparticles. However, in the presence of the film loaded with nanoparticles and without any direct contact with this film, endothelial cell growth was also enhanced on polystyrene and on Transwell insert surfaces which demonstrates the effectiveness of the nanoparticles not only to improve the mechanical properties of the film but also to deliver active VEGF. An increase in nitric oxide levels as an indicator of endothelial cell activity was monitored and was correlated with the release of VEGF from the nanoparticle/film platform.

After finding significantly increased ITT levels in men with KS, a finding even more striking than in the 41,XXY* KS mouse model, we set out to find a possible 'vascular' explanation for the lack of T release into the testicular blood stream. In testis biopsies from patients,reliable analysis of the vessels is, however, not possible because of the bias resulting from the dissection technique requiring avoidance of larger blood vessels to prevent bleeding. Consequently, the blood vessel constitution was evaluated in whole testis sections from adult male 41,XXY* and 40,XY*mice (n=5, each). Indeed, the blood vessel/testes surface ratio correcting for the smaller testes of XXY*mice was significantly lower in these mice compared with XY*controls. In conclusion, testicular T production does not seem to be impaired in men with KS. On the contrary, ITT concentrations are increased, but not because of increased SHBG activity. The data from the mouse model let us speculate that a reduced vascular bed might be involved in lower release of T into the blood stream.", "journal": "Andrology", "date": "2014-02-28", "authors": ["FTuttelmann", "O SDamm", "C MLuetjens", "MBaldi", "MZitzmann", "SKliesch", "ENieschlag", "JGromoll", "JWistuba", "MSimoni"], "doi": "10.1111/j.2047-2927.2014.00190.x"}
{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor coordinates islet innervation via vascular scaffolding.", "abstract": "Neurovascular alignment is a common anatomical feature of organs, but the mechanisms leading to this arrangement are incompletely understood. Here, we show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling profoundly affects both vascularization and innervation of the pancreatic islet. In mature islets, nerves are closely associated with capillaries, but the islet vascularization process during embryonic organogenesis significantly precedes islet innervation. Although a simple neuronal meshwork interconnects the developing islet clusters as they begin to form at E14.5, the substantial ingrowth of nerve fibers into islets occurs postnatally, when islet vascularization is already complete. Using genetic mouse models, we demonstrate that VEGF regulates islet innervation indirectly through its effects on intra-islet endothelial cells. Our data indicate that formation of a VEGF-directed, intra-islet vascular plexus is required for development of islet innervation, and that VEGF-induced islet hypervascularization leads to increased nerve fiber ingrowth. Transcriptome analysis of hypervascularized islets revealed an increased expression of extracellular matrix components and axon guidance molecules, with these transcripts being enriched in the islet-derived endothelial cell population. We propose a mechanism for coordinated neurovascular development within pancreatic islets, in which endocrine cell-derived VEGF directs the patterning of intra-islet capillaries during embryogenesis, forming a scaffold for the postnatal ingrowth of essential autonomic nerve fibers.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-02-28", "authors": ["Rachel BReinert", "QingCai", "Ji-YoungHong", "Jennifer LPlank", "KristieAamodt", "NripeshPrasad", "RadhikaAramandla", "ChunhuaDai", "Shawn ELevy", "AmbraPozzi", "Patricia ALabosky", "Christopher V EWright", "MarcelaBrissova", "Alvin CPowers"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.098657"}

Currently, studies only partially described the molecular pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus-associated effects on vasculature. However, better understanding of systemic effects is essential in unraveling key molecular events in the vascular tissue responsible for disease onset and progression.\nOur overall aim was to get an all-encompassing view of diabetes mellitus-induced key molecular changes in the vasculature. An integrative proteomic and bioinformatics analysis of data from aortic vessels in the low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model (10 animals) was performed. We observed pronounced dysregulation of molecules involved in myogenesis, vascularization, hypertension, hypertrophy (associated with thickening of the aortic wall), and a substantial reduction of fatty acid storage. A novel finding is the pronounced downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (Gsk3\u03b2) and upregulation of molecules linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (eg, aspartate aminotransferase [Got2] and hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase [Adhfe1]). In addition, pathways involving primary alcohols and amino acid breakdown are altered, potentially leading to ketone-body production. A number of these findings were validated immunohistochemically. Collectively, the data support the hypothesis that in this diabetic model, there is an overproduction of ketone-bodies within the vessels using an alternative tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated pathway, ultimately leading to the development of atherosclerosis.\nStreptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in animals leads to a reduction of fatty acid biosynthesis and an upregulation of an alternative ketone-body formation pathway.

{"title": "Angiogenic microenvironment augments impaired endothelial responses under diabetic conditions.", "abstract": "Diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy is characterized by cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction, with no treatment options currently available. Hyperglycemic memory by endothelial cells may play the key role in microvascular complications in diabetes, providing a potential target for therapeutic approaches. This study tested the hypothesis that a proangiogenic environment can augment diabetes-induced deficiencies in endothelial cell angiogenic and biomechanical responses. Endothelial responses were quantified for two models of diabetic conditions: 1) an in vitro acute and chronic hyperglycemia where normal cardiac endothelial cells were exposed to high-glucose media, and 2) an in vivo chronic diabetes model where the cells were isolated from rats with type I streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Capillary morphogenesis, VEGF and nitric oxide expression, cell morphology, orientation, proliferation, and apoptosis were determined for cells cultured on Matrigel or proangiogenic nanofiber hydrogel. The effects of biomechanical stimulation were assessed following cell exposure to uniaxial strain. The results demonstrate that diabetes alters cardiac endothelium angiogenic response, with differential effects of acute and chronic exposure to high-glucose conditions, consistent with the concept that endothelial cells may have a long-term \"hyperglycemic memory\" of the physiological environment in the body. Furthermore, endothelial cell exposure to strain significantly diminishes their angiogenic potential following strain application. Both diabetes and strain-associated deficiencies can be augmented in the proangiogenic nanofiber microenvironment.

We also show that the upregulation of the Hh pathway in response to injury and during regeneration is significantly impaired in mdx muscle. Shh treatment increases the proliferative potential of satellite cells isolated from the muscles of mdx mice. This treatment also increases the production of proregenerative factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, from fibroblasts isolated from the muscle of mdx mice.

These findings were found on magnetic resonance angiography (our preferred methodology due to its simplicity). We planned testing the sufficiency of her pedal pulses after temporarily clamping her peroneal artery but prior to harvesting, to ensure minimal risk to the longevity of her donor leg. During the operation, after dissection of a 10cm segment of her fibula with the peroneal artery, the peroneal artery proximal to the graft was temporarily clamped and the tourniquet was released. As adequate sustainable pedal pulses were confirmed, the graft was harvested and transplanted to her wrist. There was no morbidity in her right leg postoperatively and the union of the grafted fibula was substantiated 10 months postoperatively.\nWe concluded two findings: firstly, for accurate preoperative planning of a vascularized free fibula procedure, examination of the bilateral lower leg vasculature either by angiography or other imaging should be performed. Secondly, abnormalities are not in themselves reason to abandon the vascularized free fibula procedure.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine closely related to the inflammatory cytokines detected in degenerative intervertebral disc tissues. However, the existence and role of MIF and its receptor CD74 in intervertebral disc degeneration have not been elucidated.\nWe asked whether (1) MIF and its receptor CD74 are expressed in cartilage end plates with Type 1 Modic changes, (2) MIF is associated with cartilage end plate degeneration, (3) the MIF antagonist (S, R)-3(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) suppresses MIF-induced inflammatory cytokine release, and (4) inflammatory cytokines are released by cartilage end plate chondrocytes via CD74 by activating the CD74 antibody (CD74Ab).\nWe examined MIF and CD74 expression by human cartilage end plate chondrocytes and tissues with Type 1 Modic changes from eight patients using immunocytofluorescence and immunohistochemistry.

There have been several studies regarding surgical techniques for minimizing fistula formation. Specifically, the vascularized seromuscular patch flap has been used for reinforcing the anastomosis site; however, this flap does not yield a sufficient range of motion because of traction on the vascular pedicle.\nBetween 2004 and 2011, 4 patients underwent vascularized seromuscular patch flaps with free jejunal transfer. A short segment of jejunum on a mesenteric pedicle is usually opened longitudinally along the antimesenteric border to make a patch flap; however, we made a longitudinal incision along 1 side of the mesenteric border. To investigate the vascular anatomy of the flap, a lead oxide-gelatin mixture was injected into the arterial system of 4 fresh cadavers.\nThe flap had increased mobility without traction on the vascular pedicle and adequate circulation. In the injection study, it was shown that the modification guaranteed adequate circulation across the antimesenteric border and from the proximal to the distal end of the flap.\nIn conclusion, an incision along 1 side of the mesenteric border produces increased mobility of the jejunal seromuscular patch flap.

The bi-directionality of the interaction between both pathways has been shown on physiological and only recently also on molecular level. But the consequences of a disturbed circadian rhythm for the hypoxic response and the cardiovascular system have never been addressed in any organism. Here we show that the hypoxic response of animals subjected to chronodisruption is reduced by approximately 30%, as reflected by decreased expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 and its down-stream target genes erythropoietin, responsible for the generation of red blood cells (RBC) and vascular endothelial growth factor, which is essential for proper vascularization. Beside malformations of their vascular beds, chronodisrupted animals surprisingly revealed elevated numbers of senescent erythrocytes under normoxic conditions, due to a reduced clearance rate via apoptosis. Over-aged erythrocytes in turn are characterized by decreased oxygen transport capacities and an increased tendency for aggregation, explaining the higher mortality of chronodisrupted animals observed in our study.

Solid silicone rods implanted in different animals served as controls. The specimens were then double immunostained for ED1 (CD68, a general macrophage marker) and ED2 (CD163, an M2 macrophage marker). Immunostaining for CD34 (a marker for vascularization and wound healing) was also performed. Expression levels of CD34, CD163, and mannose receptor c type 1 (an M2 macrophage marker) mRNAs were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nMTA-implanted subcutaneous tissues showed significant increases in the density of ED1+ED2+ macrophages beneath the implantation site and expression levels of CD163 and MMR mRNAs compared with Life-implanted and control tissues. MTA-implanted subcutaneous tissues also showed a significant increase of CD34-immunostained areas and up-regulation of CD34 mRNAs compared with Life-implanted and control tissues.\nMTA implantation induced the accumulation of M2 macrophage marker (ED2)-expressing macrophages and enhanced the expression of M2 macrophage marker genes.

In particular, the cosmetic outcome of skin graft reconstructions, following epidermoidal carcinoma removal, is generally poor due to wide marginal tumour excision, loss of subcutaneous tissues, and subsequent pigmented atrophic scarring of the graft coverage. Skin grafting sequelae need a three dimensional correction to restore either the epidermal layer or the dermal/subdermal volume and vascularization.\nThe surgeons combined CO2 laser ablation, subdermal lipofilling according to the Coleman's technique and epidermal cell suspension autografting to correct wide depressed and dyschromic facial scar. The Authors applied this new technique on three nasal skin cancer resected patients: two of them actually need a longer follow-up, the third patient, a 48\u00a0yr old caucasian male, presented a skin grafting scar due to sclerodermiform basal cell carcinoma removal. This case is reported discussing pre-intra and post-operative records up to a complete twelve months follow-up.\nRecords at six and twelve months follow-up after surgery demonstrate a fully integrated skin graft and a good restoration of the treated area, presenting the same texture and pigmentation of the adjacent untreated skin. Optimal, stable three-dimensional skin cosmetic restoration was obtained in a single stage surgical procedure.\nAutologous non-cultured epidermal cell suspension transplantation on an epidermal laser ablated skin area, in combination with lipofilling subdermal reconstruction, appears to be an effective, simple and time-saving method to correct skin graft sequelae, in skin cancer patients. This new technique allows to restore a three-dimensional morphological structure of the treated area and to recover a natural appearance of the skin at the same time.

Although scaffolds with promising features have been produced via a variety of innovative methods, there are no fully synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds that possess all the desired properties in one three-dimensional construct. Herein, we report the development of novel polyester poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) sponges that display many of the desirable scaffold characteristics. Our novel synthetic approach utilizes acidchloride/alcohol chemistry, whereby the reaction between a hydroxyl end-functionalized 4-arm PEG and sebacoyl chloride resulted in cross-linking and simultaneous hydrogen chloride gas production, which was exploited for the in situ formation of highly interconnected pores. Variation of the fabrication conditions, including the precursor volume and concentration, allowed the pore size and structure as well as the compressive properties to be tailored. The sponges were found to possess excellent elastic properties, preserving their shape even after 80% compressive strain without failure. The benign properties of the sponges were demonstrated in an in vivo subcutaneous rat model, which also revealed uniform infiltration of vascularized tissue by 8 weeks and complete degradation of the sponges by 16 weeks, with only a minimal inflammatory response being observed over the course of the experiments.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-02-25", "authors": ["BerkayOzcelik", "AntonBlencowe", "JasonPalmer", "KatharinaLadewig", "Geoffrey WStevens", "Keren MAbberton", "Wayne AMorrison", "Greg GQiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.019"}
{"title": "Enzymatic conjugation of a bioactive peptide into an injectable hyaluronic acid-tyramine hydrogel system to promote the formation of functional vasculature.", "abstract": "In this study, one-step enzyme-mediated preparation of a multi-functional injectable hyaluronic-acid-based hydrogel system is reported. Hydrogel was formed through the in situ coupling of phenol moieties by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and bioactive peptides were simultaneously conjugated into the hydrogel during the gel formation process. The preparation of this multi-functional hydrogel was made possible by synthesizing peptides containing phenols which could couple with the phenol moieties of hyaluronic-acid-tyramine (HA-Tyr) during the HRP-mediated crosslinking reaction. Preliminary studies demonstrated that two phenol moieties per molecule resulted in a consistently high degree of conjugation into the HA-Tyr hydrogel network, unlike the one modified with one phenol moiety per molecule. Therefore, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide bearing two phenol moieties (phenol2-poly(ethylene glycol)-RGD) was designed for conjugation to endow the HA-Tyr hydrogel with adhesion signals and enhance its bioactivities. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on or within the RGD-modified hydrogels showed significantly different adhesion behavior, from non-adherence on the HA-Tyr hydrogel to strong adhesion on hydrogels modified with phenol2-poly(ethylene glycol)-RGD. This altered cell adhesion behavior led to improved cell proliferation, migration and formation of capillary-like network in the hydrogel in vitro. More importantly, when HUVECs and human fibroblasts (HFF1) were encapsulated together in the RGD-modified HA-Tyr hydrogel, functional vasculature was observed inside the cell-laden gel after 2weeks in the subcutaneous tissue. Taken together, the in situ conjugation of phenol2-poly(ethylene glycol)-RGD into HA-Tyr hydrogel system, coupled with the ease of incorporating cells, offers a simple and effective means to introduce biological signals for preparation of multi-functional injectable hydrogels for tissue engineering application.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-02-25", "authors": ["Li-ShanWang", "FanLee", "JaehongLim", "ChanDu", "Andrew C AWan", "Su SeongLee", "MotoichiKurisawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.022"}

Therefore, to investigate the role of inflammatory response and the change in mechanotransduction started by TEC after implantation, we placed a unique TEC model on the surface of the groin fat pads in rats to study the expression of cytokines and tissue development in the TEC. The number of infiltrating cells was counted, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression levels in the chamber at multiple time points postimplantation were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue samples were collected at various time points and labeled for specific cell populations. The result showed that new adipose tissue formed in the chamber at day 60. Also, the expression of MCP-1 and VEGF in the chamber decreased slightly from an early stage as well as the number of the infiltrating cells. A large number of CD34+/perilipin- perivascular cells could be detected at day 30. Also, the CD34+/perilipin+ adipose precursor cell numbers increased sharply by day 45 and then decreased by day 60. CD34-/perilipin+ mature adipocytes were hard to detect in the chamber content at day 30, but their number increased and then peaked at day 60. Ki67-positive cells could be found near blood vessels and their number decreased sharply over time. Masson's trichrome showed that collagen was the dominant component of the chamber content at early stage and was replaced by newly formed small adipocytes over time.

{"title": "Utilizing PCL microcarriers for high-purity isolation of primary endothelial cells for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are widely used in research, both for fundamental vascular biology research and for exploring strategies to create engineered vascularized tissues. Primary isolation often results in contamination from fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells that can potentially affect function, particularly during the initial expansion period needed to establish the cell culture. In the current study, we explored the use of microcarriers to selectively isolate ECs from the lumen of intact vessels to enhance the purity during the isolation procedure. First, rat aortic explant culture was performed and after 2 weeks of culture, flow cytometry revealed that only 60% of the expanded cell population was positive for the endothelial marker CD31. Then, we employed a strategy to selectively isolate ECs and improve their purity by introducing microcarriers to the lumen of intact aorta. After 10 days, microcarriers were carefully removed and placed in cell culture dishes and at 15 days, a large near confluent layer of primary ECs populated the dish. Flow cytometry revealed that >90% of the expanded cells expressed CD31. Moreover, the cells were capable of forming tubule-like structures when plated onto Matrigel, confirming their function also. The highly modular and transportable nature of microcarriers has significant potential for isolating ECs at high purity, with minimal contamination.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The present study attempts to clarify the effects of continuous taurocholic acid (TCA) exposure, which is neither mutagenic nor genotoxic, on ESCC progression.\nA squamous carcinoma cell line (ESCC-DR) was established from a tumor induced in a rat model of gastroduodenal reflux. ESCC-DR cells were incubated with 2 mM TCA for \u22652 months. The effects of continuous TCA exposure were evaluated in vitro on cell morphology, growth, and invasion and in vivo on xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, the mean level of secreted transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins in cell culture supernatants and mRNA synthesis of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF-A of ESCC cells were measured. The angiogenic potential was further examined by a migration assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).\nContinuous TCA exposure induced marked formation of filopodia in vitro. Expression levels of angiogenic factors were significantly higher in the cells treated with TCA than in control cells. Tumor xenografts derived from cells pre-exposed to TCA were larger and more vascularized than those derived from control cells. In addition, TCA exposure increased HUVEC migration.\nContinuous TCA exposure enhanced ESCC progression due to reduced cell loss in vivo.

Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 \u00d7 10(6) exponentially growing Lewis carcinoma 3LL cells into the dorsum. Study variables 9 days later were tumor weight (TW), Hb content, an index of tumor vascularization, VEGF, and AP activity. T4 produced parallel increases in TW and angiogenesis. L-NAME reduced TW and angiogenesis in control, hyperthyroid, and hypothyroid mice, whereas AG had no effect on these variables. Tetrac arrested TW in normal and T4-treated mice but did not decrease angiogenesis in T4-treated animals. Negative correlations were found between TW and AP activity in tumors from control hyper- and hypothyroid groups and an inverse relationship was observed between TW and AP activities in tetrac-treated mice. T4 enhances TW and angiogenesis, in which NO participates, but requires activation of integrin \u03b1v\u00df3 to promote carcinogenesis. NO blockade reduces TW, regardless of the thyroid status.

In this method, ECM-nanofilm is constructed using layer-by-layer assembly of fibronectin and gelatin on culture cells. The ECM-nanofilm promotes cell-to-cell interaction; then the three-dimensional (3D) multilayered tissue can be constructed with morphological change of the cells mimicking living tissues. By using this method, we have successfully produced tubular networks of human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) in 3D multilayered normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). This study demonstrated morphological characteristics of the vascular networks in the engineered tissues by using light and electron microscopy. In light microscopy, HUVECs and HDLECs formed luminal structures such as native blood and lymphatic capillaries, respectively. Electron microscopy showed distinct ultrastructural aspects of the vasculature of HUVECs or HDLECs with intermediated NHDFs and abundant ECM. The vasculature constructed by HUVECs exhibited structures similar to native blood capillaries, involving overlapping endothelial connections with adherens junctions, abundant vesicles in the endothelial cells and basement membrane-like structure. The detection of laminin around HUVEC-constructed vessels supported the presence of perivascular basal lamina. The vasculature constructed by HDLECs showed some ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of native lymphatic capillaries such as irregular vascular shape, loose adhesive connection and gap formation between endothelial cells.

{"title": "Endothelial cell-derived interleukin-6 regulates tumor growth.", "abstract": "Endothelial cells play a complex role in the pathobiology of cancer. This role is not limited to the making of blood vessels to allow for influx of oxygen and nutrients required for the high metabolic demands of tumor cells. Indeed, it has been recently shown that tumor-associated endothelial cells secrete molecules that enhance tumor cell survival and cancer stem cell self-renewal. The hypothesis underlying this work is that specific disruption of endothelial cell-initiated signaling inhibits tumor growth.\nConditioned medium from primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) stably transduced with silencing RNA for IL-6 (or controls) was used to evaluate the role of endothelial-derived IL-6 on the activation of key signaling pathways in tumor cells. In addition, these endothelial cells were co-transplanted with tumor cells into immunodefficient mice to determine the impact of endothelial cell-derived IL-6 on tumor growth and angiogenesis.\nWe observed that tumor cells adjacent to blood vessels show strong phosphorylation of STAT3, a key mediator of tumor progression. In search for a possible mechanism for the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, we observed that silencing interleukin (IL)-6 in tumor-associated endothelial cells inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in tumor cells. Notably, tumors vascularized with IL-6-silenced endothelial cells showed lower intratumoral microvessel density, lower tumor cell proliferation, and slower growth than tumors vascularized with control endothelial cells.\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that IL-6 secreted by endothelial cells enhance tumor growth, and suggest that cancer patients might benefit from targeted approaches that block signaling events initiated by endothelial cells.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2014-02-19", "authors": ["Kathleen GNeiva", "Kristy AWarner", "Marcia SCampos", "ZhaochengZhang", "JulianaMoren", "Theodora EDanciu", "Jacques EN\u00f6r"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-14-99\n10.3322/caac.20107\n10.1002/1097-0142(19900601)65:11<2507::AID-CNCR2820651120>3.0.CO;2-9\n10.1046/j.1525-1438.1999.09895.x\n10.1006/gyno.2000.5826\n10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04646-8\n10.1002/cncr.20064\n10.1002/cncr.20877\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0231\n10.1093/jnci/djj067\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1038/nrc905\n10.1056/NEJMra0706596\n10.1126/science.289.5482.1197\n10.1016/S1367-5931(00)00207-6\n10.1016/j.drup.2008.09.001\n10.1056/NEJMp048143\n10.1016/j.ejca.2006.09.015\n10.1038/nrc2152\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e3282f9b575\n10.1006/gyno.2001.6235\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605212\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206226\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1497\n10.1038/labinvest.3780253\n10.1593/neo.07815\n10.1593/neo.06274\n10.1172/JCI31871\n10.1172/JCI32533\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.054\n10.1002/cmdc.200800123\n10.1196/annals.1378.063\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210422\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4790\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00248-4\n10.1038/nrc839\n10.1073/pnas.0606836103\n10.1016/j.advenzreg.2006.12.013\n10.1016/j.cyto.2011.05.012\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.09.033\n10.1038/nrc2442"}

The most challenging category in FNAB is atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS). The Bethesda system (BS) recommends repeat FNAB in that category due to its low risk of malignancy. In our study, we aimed to investigate the malignancy rate of thyroid nodules of AUS and FLUS and whether there were different malignancy rates among the different patterns in this category, and to evaluate the presence of biochemical, clinical, and echographic features possibly predictive of malignancy related to AUS and FLUS. Data of 268 patients operated for AUS and FLUS cytology were screened retrospectively. Ultrasonographic features and thyroid function tests, thyroid antibodies, scintigraphy, and histopathological results were evaluated. Of the 268 patients' results, 276 nodules are evaluated. Malignancy rates were 24.3 % in the AUS group, 19.8 % in the FLUS group, and 22.8 % in both groups. In the evaluation of all nodules, the predictive features of malignancy are hypoechogenicity and peripheral vascularization of the nodule. We determined that the malignancy rates in these nodules are higher than that in the literature rate. This high ratio may be due to the fact that we studied only patients who underwent surgery. The ultrasonographic features alone may be insufficient to predict the malignancy; therefore, all the clinical and ultrasonographic features must be considered in the evaluation of the thyroid nodules.

Using the Rip1Tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), we have investigated the potential benefit of a combination of anti-angiogenic treatment with targeted internal radiotherapy.\n[Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, a radiopeptide that selectively binds to GLP-1R expressed on insulinoma and other neuroendocrine tumor cells, was co-administered with oral vatalanib (an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)) or imatinib (a c-kit/PDGFR inhibitor). The control groups included single-agent kinase inhibitor treatments and [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-natIn)NH2]-exendin-4 monotherapy. For biodistribution, Rip1Tag2 mice were pre-treated with oral vatalanib or imatinib for 0, 3, 5, or 7 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Subsequently, [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 was administered i.v., and the biodistribution was assessed after 4 h. For therapy, the mice were injected with 1.1 MBq [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and treated with vatalanib or imatinib 100 mg/kg orally for another 7 days. Tumor volume, tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation, and microvessel density were quantified.\nCombination of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and vatalanib was significantly more effective than single treatments (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and reduced the tumor volume by 97% in the absence of organ damage. The pre-treatment of mice with vatalanib led to a reduction in the tumor uptake of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, indicating that concomitant administration of vatalanib and the radiopeptide was the best approach.

Recently, advances in oncoplastic techniques are capable of preserving the breast form and quality of life. Although most BCS defects can be managed with primary closure, the aesthetic outcome may be unpredictable. Among technical options, therapeutic reduction mammaplasty (TRM) remains a useful procedure since the BCS defect can be repaired and the preoperative appearance can be improved, resulting in more proportional breasts. As a consequence of rich breast tissue vascularization, the greater part of reduction techniques have based their planning on preserving the pedicle of the nipple-areola complex after tumor removal. Reliable circulation and improvement of a conical shape to the breast are commonly described in TRM reconstructions. With an immediate approach, the surgical process is smooth since both procedures can be carried out in one operative setting. Additionally, it permits wider excision of the tumor, with a superior mean volume of the specimen and potentially reduces the incidence of margin involvement. Regardless of the fact that there is no consensus concerning the best TRM technique, the criteria is determined by the surgeon's experience, the extent/location of glandular tissue resection and the size of the defect in relation to the size of the remaining breast. The main advantages of the technique utilized should include reproducibility, low interference with the oncological treatment and long-term results.

Among them, MMP-9 has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, a member of the family of MMP inhibitors, induces apoptosis and inhibits various stages of angiogenesis. Previous studies analyzing the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-2 in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are scarce. The aims of the current study were to evaluate MMP-9 and TIMP-2 expression in MTC samples and correlate the results with clinical parameters. Paraffin-embedded samples from 77 MTC patients were evaluated for expression by immunohistochemistry. The clinical data in medical records were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 77 patients aged 35.6\u00b117.1 years were enrolled. Of these patients, 36 had hereditary disease (46.8%). Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9 and TIMP-2 was detected in 89.6 and 93.5% of the samples, respectively. The expression of MMP-9 was not found to correlate with clinical parameters, although, a trend toward a correlation between MMP-9 and distant metastasis was observed (P=0.053). By contrast, TIMP-2 staining was found to correlate with age at diagnosis (P=0.026) and negatively correlate with tumor size and tumoral stage (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Notably, the highest levels of TIMP-2 expression were observed in patients with intrathyroidal disease.

Acute pulmonary emboli usually resolve <6 months. However, in some instances, thrombi transform into fibrous vascular obstructions, resulting in occlusion of the deep veins, or in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We proposed that dysregulated thrombus angiogenesis may contribute to thrombus persistence.\nMice with an endothelial cell-specific conditional deletion of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2/kinase insert domain protein receptor were used in a model of stagnant flow venous thrombosis closely resembling human deep vein thrombosis. Biochemical and functional analyses were performed on pulmonary endarterectomy specimens from patients with CTEPH, a human model of nonresolving venous thromboembolism. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of kinase insert domain protein receptor and subsequent ablation of thrombus vascularization delayed thrombus resolution. In accordance with these findings, organized human CTEPH thrombi were largely devoid of vascular structures. Several vessel-specific genes, such as kinase insert domain protein receptor, vascular endothelial cadherin, and podoplanin, were expressed at lower levels in white CTEPH thrombi than in organizing deep vein thrombi and organizing thrombi from aortic aneurysms. In addition, red CTEPH thrombi attenuated the angiogenic response induced by vascular endothelial growth factor.\nIn the present work, we propose a mechanism of thrombus nonresolution demonstrating that endothelial cell-specific deletion of kinase insert domain protein receptor abates thrombus vessel formation, misguiding thrombus resolution.

On these premises, we sought to assess the reparative potential of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells bioengineered to secrete PlGF or MMP9 and delivered to infarcted myocardium upon a poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen scaffold. When assessing optimal stiffness of the PEG-fibrinogen (PF) scaffold, we found that the appearance of contracting cells after cardiogenic induction was accelerated on the support designed with an intermediate stiffness. Revascularization and hemodynamic parameters of infarcted mouse heart were significantly improved by injection into the infarct of this optimized PF scaffold seeded with both MiPS (iPS cells engineered to secrete MMP9) and PiPS (iPS cells engineered to secrete PlGF) cells as compared with nonengineered cells or PF alone.

Tertiary lymphoid tissue (TLT) is an ectopic organized lymph node-like structure that typically forms at sites of chronic inflammation and is involved in adaptive immune responses. Its occurrence in cancer is sporadically documented and its role and clinical relevance is largely unknown.\nThe occurrence of TLT, the correlation with TILs, and the clinical relevance were evaluated retrospectively, in a cohort study involving a consecutive series of 351 patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer. The role of TLT in lymphocyte recruitment was assessed in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer.\nIn both human colorectal cancer and in a murine model of colorectal cancer, we identified organized TLT, highly vascularized (including high endothelial venules), and correlated with the density of CD3(+) TILs. Intravenous injection in mice of GFP splenocytes resulted in homing of lymphocytes to TLT, suggesting an active role of TLT in the recruitment of lymphocytes to tumor areas. Accordingly, TLT density and TIL infiltration correlated and were coordinated in predicting better patient's outcome among patients with stage II colorectal cancer.\nWe provide evidence that TLT is associated with lymphocyte infiltration in colorectal cancer, providing a pathway of recruitment for TILs.

Among them endograft infection is a rare but devastating occurrence, accounting for an incidence ranging from 0.2% to 0.7% in major series, and almost 1% of all causes of endograft explantations. However, a real estimation of the incidence of the problem respect to the number of EVAR implantations is difficult to obtain. Time to infection is usually defined as the period between EVAR and presentation of symptoms that leads to the infection diagnosis. It can be extremely variable, depending on bacterial virulence and host conditions. The diagnosis of an endograft infection is usually based on a combination of clinical symptoms, imaging studies and microbial cultures whenever possible. If computed tomography (CT) scan is employed in almost 100% of infection diagnosis, a combination of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT scan is nowadays used with increasing frequency in order to rise the likelihood of detecting a graft infection, since even cultures of blood or samples collected from the infected field can sometimes be negative. Complete graft excision seems the best approach whenever a surgical reconstruction could be attempted. In situ reconstruction can be performed by the interposition of an autologous vein, a cryopreserved allograft or a rifampin-soaked Dacron graft. The so-called conventional treatment contemplates the re-establishment of vascularization through extranatomical routes, thus preserving the new graft material from possible contamination by the surgical field just cleaned. When severe comorbid conditions did not allow graft excision, a conservative treatment should be taken into account. It is mainly based on broad-spectrum or culture-specific antibiotic therapy combined, whenever possible, with percutaneous drainage of the infectious cavity or aneurismal sac followed by irrigation with saline and antibiotic solutions. New techniques of percutaneous drainage under CT scan guidance can allow expedite collection of fluid material for microbial culture or fluid drainage, catheter positioning to collect infectious material from the cavity and perform irrigation of the infected field or injection of iodine contrast when the suspicion of aortoenteric fistula exists.", "journal": "The Journal of cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2014-02-13", "authors": ["LCapoccia", "GMestres", "VRiambau"], "doi": null}

The transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM), vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM), and oblique designs (ORAM) are the most common. The most frequent complication with these flaps is partial flap necrosis. We describe a new vascular zoning method and a revised classification of abdominal wall perfusion that is applicable when harvesting pedicled TRAM flaps to make them more secure.\nFrom February 2009 to February 2013, we performed 70 pedicled RAM flaps in 68 patients for breast reconstruction (79%) as well as pelvic and inguinal reconstruction after bowel and gynecologic tumor resection. Clinical data about cutaneous vascularization of the flaps along with before and after photos were prospectively collected and analyzed, and results were evaluated retrospectively. We collected observations on partial flap necrosis, reviewed the literature, and made design modifications to exclude doubtful vascular territories.\nOf the total number of flaps, 59 were TRAMs, 7 were VRAMs, and 1 was an ORAM flap. Three combined horizontal and vertical flaps, or what we call TV RAM flaps, were performed. No flap-related complications were observed with VRAM, TV RAM, or ORAM flaps. Three instances of partial necrosis (in the same vascular territory) occurred with TRAM flaps; as a result, we changed our approach to these flaps and examined alternatives to the classical vascular zoning.\nWe discussed abdominal skin perfusion in accordance with the literature and based on our experience with harvesting pedicled RAM flaps.

The two vascular networks of the embryonic forebrain, pial and periventricular, are spatially distinctive and have different origins and growth patterns. Endothelial cells from the pial and periventricular vascular networks have unique gene expression profiles and functions. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for isolation, culture, and verification of pure populations of endothelial cells from the periventricular vascular network (PVECs) of the embryonic forebrain (telencephalon). In this approach, telencephalon devoid of pial membrane obtained from embryonic day 15 mice is minced, digested with collagenase/dispase, and dispersed mechanically into a single cell suspension. PVECs are purified from cell suspension using positive selection with anti-CD-31/PECAM-1 antibody conjugated to MicroBeads using a strong magnetic separation method. Purified cells are cultured on collagen 1 coated culture dishes in endothelial cell culture medium until they become confluent and further subcultured. PVECs obtained with this protocol exhibit cobblestone and spindle shaped phenotypes, as visualized by phase-contrast light microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Purity of PVEC cultures was established with endothelial cell markers. In our hands, this method reliably and consistently yields pure populations of PVECs.

{"title": "Strategies affording prevascularized cell-based constructs for myocardial tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The production of a functional cardiac tissue to be transplanted in the injured area of the infarcted myocardium represents a challenge for regenerative medicine. Most cell-based grafts are unviable because of inadequate perfusion; therefore, prevascularization might be a suitable approach for myocardial tissue engineering. To this aim, cells with a differentiation potential towards vascular and cardiac muscle phenotypes have been cocultured in 2D or 3D appropriate scaffolds. In addition to these basic approaches, more sophisticated strategies have been followed employing mixed-cell sheets, microvascular modules, and inosculation from vascular explants. Technologies exerting spatial control of vascular cells, such as topographical surface roughening and ordered patterning, represent other ways to drive scaffold vascularization. Finally, microfluidic devices and bioreactors exerting mechanical stress have also been employed for high-throughput scaling-up production in order to accelerate muscle differentiation and speeding the endothelialization process. Future research should address issues such as how to optimize cells, biomaterials, and biochemical components to improve the vascular integration of the construct within the cardiac wall, satisfying the metabolic and functional needs of the myocardial tissue.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2014-02-11", "authors": ["ClaudioMuscari", "EmanueleGiordano", "FrancescaBonaf\u00e8", "MarcoGovoni", "CarloGuarnieri"], "doi": "10.1155/2014/434169"}

Vessels were detected by staining with fluorescent antibodies against CD31. We showed that Gelfoam(\u00ae) implanted in transgenic mice expressing the nestin promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP mice) was rapidly vascularized with ND-GFP-expressing nascent blood vessels. Angiogenesis in the Gelfoam(\u00ae) was quantified by measuring the total length of ND-GFP-expressing nascent blood vessels in a skin flap by in vivo fluorescence microscopy imaging. The ND-GFP-expressing nascent blood vessels formed a network on the surface of the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-treated Gelfoam(\u00ae). We then developed a color-coded imaging model that can visualize the interaction between \u03b1v integrin linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in osteosarcoma cells and blood vessels in Gelfoam(\u00ae) vascularized after implantation in red fluorescent protein (RFP) transgenic nude mice. The implanted Gelfoam(\u00ae) became highly vascularized with RFP-expressing vessels in 14 days. 143B osteosarcoma cells expressing \u03b1v integrin-GFP were injected into the Gelfoam(\u00ae) after transplantation of Gelfoam(\u00ae). After cancer cell injection, cancer cells interacting with blood vessels were observed in the Gelfoam(\u00ae) by color-coded confocal microscopy through the skin flap window. We developed another color-coded Gelfoam(\u00ae)-based imaging model that can visualize the anastomosis between blood vessels. RFP-expressing vessels in vascularized Gelfoam(\u00ae), previously transplanted into RFP transgenic mice, were re-transplanted into ND-GFP mice. Skin flaps were made and anastomosis between the GFP-expressing nascent blood vessels of ND-GFP transgenic nude mice and RFP blood vessels in the transplanted Gelfoam(\u00ae) could be imaged.

{"title": "Examining vascular remodeling in the hypoxic central nervous system.", "abstract": "The goal of this chapter is to highlight techniques used to determine the role of molecular mechanisms involved in remodeling of cerebral blood vessels. Enhanced vascularization in the central nervous system (CNS) is seen in many diseases including stroke, cancer, and multiple sclerosis (MS). However, despite the prevalence of this phenomenon in these different pathological conditions, the exact nature of how it occurs still remains unclear. To better understand the process of cerebrovascular remodeling, we use the chronic hypoxia model, in which a vigorous and robust angiogenic remodeling response takes place. In this model, mice are placed in a hypoxic chamber (8 % O2 for up to 14 days), which results in strong vascular remodeling and increased vessel density within the CNS. Using an immunofluorescent (IF)-based approach, different aspects of this vascular remodeling response can be examined. By employing this method, we have shown that chronic mild hypoxia triggers both angiogenic (capillary sprouting) and arteriogenic (widening of arterial vessels) responses. Furthermore, we have used this system to define both the expression pattern and potential role of candidate adhesion molecules in this vascular remodeling process. Thus, the techniques described in this chapter can be used to define the importance of different molecular mechanisms in vascular remodeling in the CNS.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2014-02-11", "authors": ["AminBoroujerdi", "Jennifer VWelser-Alves", "RichardMilner"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-0320-7_15"}
{"title": "Analysis of angiogenesis in the developing mouse central nervous system.", "abstract": "In order to study basic mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis, researchers worldwide rely on the use of model tissues such as rodent retina, which becomes vascularized postnatally, to study the growth of blood vessels. By definition, models have to be simple, recapitulating angiogenic processes in a stereotyped and relatively easy accessible manner, allowing the application of standardized analyses. These criteria also apply in an ideal manner to the embryonic mouse hindbrain, which becomes vascularized by sprouting angiogenesis from a preformed perineural vascular plexus, leading to the stereotypical formation of a capillary subventricular plexus. Similar to the retina model, between embryonic days 10.5 and 13.5, the hindbrain can be flat-mounted in an \"open-book\" preparation, allowing the analysis of the vascular bed in two-dimensional extension, of parameters like vessel density, morphology, and remodeling including branching and sprouting. In addition to sprouting angiogenesis, the hindbrain is a suitable model for investigating inductive mechanisms towards the blood-brain barrier phenotype of microvessels in the central nervous system.

The ability to regenerate new bone tissues that faithfully replicate the anatomy would revolutionize treatment options. Advances in the field of bone tissue engineering over the past few decades offer promising new treatment alternatives using biocompatible scaffold materials and autologous cells. This approach combined with recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies may soon allow the generation of large, bioartificial bone grafts with custom, patient-specific architecture. In this study, we use a custom-built 3D printer to develop anatomically shaped polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with varying internal porosities. These scaffolds are assessed for their ability to support induction of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to form vasculature and bone, two essential components of functional bone tissue. The development of functional tissues is assessed in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to print large mandibular and maxillary bone scaffolds that replicate fine details extracted from patient's computed tomography scans.

We introduce a tissue engineering approach to explore the interactions between human tumor cells and a humanized bone microenvironment. Scaffolds, seeded with human primary osteoblasts in conjunction with BMP7, were implanted into immunodeficient mice to form humanized tissue engineered bone constructs (hTEBCs) which consequently resulted in the generation of highly vascularized and viable humanized bone. At 12 weeks, PC3 and LNCaP cells were injected into the hTEBCs. Seven weeks later the mice were euthanized. Micro-CT, histology, TRAP, PTHrP and osteocalcin staining results reflected the different characteristics of the two cell lines regarding their phenotypic growth pattern within bone. Microvessel density, as assessed by vWF staining, showed that tumor vessel density was significantly higher in LNCaP injected hTEBC implants than in those injected with PC3 cells (p < 0.001). Interestingly, PC3 cells showed morphological features of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes suggesting a cellular plasticity within this microenvironment. Taken together, a highly reproducible humanized model was established which is successful in generating LNCaP and PC3 tumors within a complex humanized bone microenvironment. This model simulates the conditions seen clinically more closely than any other model described in the literature to date and hence represents a powerful experimental platform that can be used in future work to investigate specific biological questions relevant to bone metastasis.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2014-02-11", "authors": ["ParisaHesami", "Boris MHolzapfel", "AnnaTaubenberger", "MartineRoudier", "LadanFazli", "ShirlySieh", "LaureThibaudeau", "Laura SGregory", "Dietmar WHutmacher", "Judith AClements"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-014-9638-5"}

Pravastatin has been demonstrated to be useful in preventing steroid-induced ONFH in animal models. However, its exact mechanisms acting on this disease have not been fully elucidated. To address this problem, steroid-induced ONFH rat model was constructed to evaluate the effects of pravastatin treatment on the osteonecrotic changes and repair processes. Then, Micro-CT-based micro-angiography was performed to assess the effects of pravastatin treatment on vascularization. In addition, serum lipid levels were detected by haematological examination. After that, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), Wnt3a, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), \u03b2-catenin and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) at both mRNA and protein levels were further detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot analyses. The results, the ratio of empty lacuna, adipose tissue area, and adipocyte perimeter in the bone marrow were dramatically lower in the pravastatin treatment groups than in the model group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, by micro-CT quantification, pravastatin treatment dose-dependently increased vessel volume, vessel surface, percentage of vessel volume, and vessel thickness of the femoral heads of steroid-induced ONFH rats. Importantly, pravastatin treatment could prevent steroid-induced ONFH by suppressing the expression of PPAR\u03b3, and increasing the expression of Wnt3a, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, and RUNX2, at both mRNA and protein levels, in the femoral heads of steroid-induced ONFH rats.

{"title": "B cells mediate chronic allograft rejection independently of antibody production.", "abstract": "Chronic rejection is the primary cause of long-term failure of transplanted organs and is often viewed as an antibody-dependent process. Chronic rejection, however, is also observed in mice and humans with no detectable circulating alloantibodies, suggesting that antibody-independent pathways may also contribute to pathogenesis of transplant rejection. Here, we have provided direct evidence that chronic rejection of vascularized heart allografts occurs in the complete absence of antibodies, but requires the presence of B cells. Mice that were deficient for antibodies but not B cells experienced the same chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), which is a pathognomonic feature of chronic rejection, as WT mice; however, mice that were deficient for both B cells and antibodies were protected from CAV. B cells contributed to CAV by supporting splenic lymphoid architecture, T cell cytokine production, and infiltration of T cells into graft vessels. In chimeric mice, in which B cells were present but could not present antigen, both T cell responses and CAV were markedly reduced. These findings establish that chronic rejection can occur in the complete absence of antibodies and that B cells contribute to this process by supporting T cell responses through antigen presentation and maintenance of lymphoid architecture.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2014-02-11", "authors": ["QiangZeng", "Yue-HarnNg", "TriptiSingh", "KeJiang", "Khaleefathullah ASheriff", "ReneeIppolito", "SalwaZahalka", "QiLi", "ParmjeetRandhawa", "Rosemary AHoffman", "BalathiripurasundariRamaswami", "Frances ELund", "GeethaChalasani"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI70084\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03539.x\n10.1016/j.humimm.2010.09.012\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01599.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2007.01836.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2007.01997.x\n10.1034/j.1600-6143.2003.00164.x\n10.1073/pnas.93.9.4051\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2010.03223.x\n10.1038/nri2729\n10.1084/jem.194.11.1649\n10.1084/jem.187.7.1009\n10.1038/350423a0\n10.1038/334676a0\n10.4049/jimmunol.1002983\n10.1172/JCI41861\n10.1038/nm1673\n10.1002/art.20430\n10.1172/JCI46274"}

Tumor angiogenesis can be quantified by microvascular density (MVD), which is evaluated in highly vascularized tumor areas (hot spots) by immunohistochemical assays using CD34 and CD31 pan-endothelial antibodies. More recently, CD105 has been successfully used for some tumor types because it could discriminate neovascularization. The expression of CD34 and CD105 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and hepatic precancerous lesions has been reported-although the results for CD105 are controversial-but to the best our knowledge, CD105 has not been previously investigated in dysplastic nodules (DN). We investigated and compared MVD-CD34 and MVD-CD105 immunoexpression in tissues containing different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, including DN.\nA total of 31 regenerative nodules (RN), 26 DN and 25 small HCC from explants were used for immunohistochemical tests with CD34 and CD105 antibodies.

{"title": "Pontine encephalocele and abnormalities of the posterior fossa following transclival endoscopic endonasal surgery.", "abstract": "Transclival endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has recently been used for the treatment of posterior fossa tumors. The optimal method of reconstruction of large clival defects following EES has not been established.\nA morphometric analysis of the posterior fossa was performed in patients who underwent transclival EES to compare those with observed postoperative anatomical changes (study group) to 50 normal individuals (anatomical control group) and 41 matched transclival cases with preserved posterior fossa anatomy (case-control group) using the same parameters. Given the absence of clival bone following transclival EES, the authors used the line between the anterior commissure and the basion as an equivalent to the clival plane to evaluate the location of the pons. Four parameters were studied and compared in the two populations: the pontine location/displacement, the maximum anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the pons, the maximum AP diameter of the fourth ventricle, and the cervicomedullary angle (CMA). All measurements were performed on midsagittal 3-month postoperative MR images in the study group.\nAmong 103 posterior fossa tumors treated with transclival EES, 14 cases (13.6%) with postoperative posterior fossa anatomy changes were identified. The most significant change was anterior displacement of the pons (transclival pontine encephalocele) compared with the normal location in the anatomical control group (p < 0.0001). Other significant deformities were expansion of the AP diameter of the pons (p = 0.005), enlargement of the fourth ventricle (p = 0.001), and decrease in the CMA (p < 0.0001). All patients who developed these changes had undergone extensive resection of the clival bone (> 50% of the clivus) and dura. Nine (64.3%) of the 14 patients were overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 25 kg/m(2)). An association between BMI and the degree of pontine encephalocele was observed, but did not reach statistical significance. The use of a fat graft as part of the reconstruction technique following transclival EES with dural opening was the single significant factor that prevented pontine displacement (p = 0.02), associated with 91% lower odds of pontine encephalocele (OR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.77). The effect of fat graft reconstruction was more pronounced in overweight/obese individuals (p = 0.04) than in normal-weight patients (p = 0.52). Besides reconstruction technique, other noticeable findings were the tendency of younger adults to develop pontine encephalocele (p = 0.05) and the association of postoperative meningitis with the development of posterior fossa deformities (p = 0.05). One patient developed a transient, recurrent subjective diplopia; all others remained asymptomatic.\nSignificant changes in posterior fossa anatomy that have potential clinical implications have been observed following transclival transdural EES.

Efficacy of a post-exposure topical doxycycline (2\u2009mg/ml in phosphate buffer saline, \u00d74/d), targeted to the different phases of the clinical injury, was evaluated.\nElevated MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities were found in all corneas during the acute injury and in vascularized corneas during the delayed pathology. In the tear fluid, high MMP-9 activity and negligible MMP-2 activity were found in all the exposed eyes until after the appearance of the delayed pathology symptoms. Prolonged doxycycline treatment reduced MMP-9 activity in the tear fluid. During the acute phase, doxycycline treatment reduced corneal MMP-9 activity and the severity of the injury. Targeting the delayed pathology, doxycycline was clinically efficient only when treatment began before NV appearance.\nThis in vivo study showed the involvement of MMP-9 and MMP-2 during different phases of the SM-induced ocular injury, and the potential of doxycycline treatment as a post exposure measure for reducing the acute injury and as a preventive therapy for ameliorating the delayed pathology. The tear fluid provided a non-invasive method for continuous follow-up of MMPs activity and revealed additional beneficial aspects of injury and the treatment.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2014-02-08", "authors": ["VeredHorwitz", "ShlomitDachir", "MaayanCohen", "HilaGutman", "LiatCohen", "EliezerFishbine", "RachelBrandeis", "JosephTuretz", "AdinaAmir", "ArielGore", "TamarKadar"], "doi": "10.3109/02713683.2013.874443"}
{"title": "Breaking wind to survive: fishes that breathe air with their gut.", "abstract": "Several taxonomically disparate groups of fishes have evolved the ability to extract oxygen from the air with elements of their gut. Despite perceived difficulties with balancing digestive and respiratory function, gut air breathing (GAB) has evolved multiple times in fishes and several GAB families are among the most successful fish families in terms of species numbers. When gut segments evolve into an air-breathing organ (ABO), there is generally a specialized region for exchange of gases where the gut wall has diminished, vascularization has increased, capillaries have penetrated into the luminal epithelium and surfactant is produced. This specialized region is generally separated from digestive portions of the gut by sphincters. GAB fishes tend to be facultative air breathers that use air breathing to supplement aquatic respiration in hypoxic waters. Some hindgut breathers may be continuous, but not obligate air breathers (obligate air breathers drown if denied access to air). Gut ABOs are generally used only for oxygen uptake; CO\u2082 elimination seems to occur via the gills and skin in all GAB fishes studied. Aerial ventilation in GAB fishes is driven primarily by oxygen partial pressure of the water (PO\u2082) and possibly also by metabolic demand. The effect of aerial ventilation on branchial ventilation and the cardiovascular system is complex and generalizations across taxa or ABO type are not currently possible. Blood from GAB fishes generally has a low blood oxygen partial pressure that half saturates haemoglobin (p50) with a very low erythrocytic nucleoside triphosphate concentration [NTP]. GAB behaviour in nature depends on the social and ecological context of the animal as well as on physiological factors.", "journal": "Journal of fish biology", "date": "2014-02-08", "authors": ["J ANelson"], "doi": "10.1111/jfb.12323"}
{"title": "Secretion of VEGF-165 has unique characteristics, including shedding from the plasma membrane.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of endothelial cell differentiation and vasculogenesis during both development and tumor vascularization. VEGF-165 is a major form that is secreted from the cells via a poorly characterized pathway. Here we use green fluorescent protein- and epitope-tagged VEGF-165 and find that its early trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi requires the small GTP-binding proteins Sar1 and Arf1 and that its glycosylation in the Golgi compartment is necessary for efficient post-Golgi transport and secretion from the cells. The relative temperature insensitivity of VEGF secretion and its Sar1 and Arf1 inhibitory profiles distinguish it from other cargoes using the \"constitutive\" secretory pathway. Prominent features of VEGF secretion are the retention of the protein on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and the stimulation of its secretion by Ca(2+) and protein kinase C. Of importance, shedding of VEGF-165 from the cell surface together with other membrane components appears to be a unique feature by which some VEGF is delivered to the surroundings to exert its known biological actions. Understanding VEGF trafficking can reveal additional means by which tumor vascularization can be inhibited by pharmacological interventions.", "journal": "Molecular biology of the cell", "date": "2014-02-07", "authors": ["Maria LuisaGuzm\u00e1n-Hern\u00e1ndez", "GaelPotter", "Krist\u00f3fEgerv\u00e1ri", "Jozsef ZKiss", "TamasBalla"], "doi": "10.1091/mbc.E13-07-0418"}

Circulating levels of positive regulators of angiogenesis [VEGF, osteopontin (OPN), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)], and the negative regulator pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), were measured by immunoassay at baseline and 12 months. Changes were compared using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for baseline levels of analytes and body mass index (BMI).\nVEGF, OPN, or PAI-1 levels did not differ by intervention arm. Participants randomized to exercise significantly reduced PEDF (-3.7%) versus controls (+3.0%; P = 0.009).

There was a significant association between decreases in VO2max, and increased reductions in PEDF (Ptrend = 0.03), compared with participants who increased their level of fitness.\nFat loss reduces circulating PAI-1 and PEDF.

{"title": "Parathyroid hormone 1-84 targets bone vascular structure and perfusion in mice: impacts of its administration regimen and of ovariectomy.", "abstract": "Bone vessel functions during bone remodeling are poorly understood. They depend on both vessel network structure and vasomotor regulation. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a systemic vasodilator that may modulate microvascularization. Moreover, although intermittent PTH is anti-osteoporotic, continuous PTH administration can be catabolic for bone. Finally, ovariectomy (OVX) reduces bone perfusion and vessel density in mice. We reasoned that the effects of PTH on bone vascularization might depend on its administration regimen and be impacted by ovariectomy. A 100-\u00b5g/kg PTH 1-84 daily dose was administered for 15 days to 4-month-old female C57BL/6 mice, either as daily sc injection (iPTH) or continuously (cPTH; ALZET minipump). Blood pressure (BP) and tibia bone perfusion were measured in vivo with a laser Doppler device. Histomorphometry of bone and barium-contrasted vascular network were performed on the same tibia. Compared with untreated controls, both iPTH and cPTH increased bone formation but had opposite effects on resorption. Both iPTH and cPTH were slightly angiogenic. Intermittent PTH increased microvessel size (+48%, p < 0.001), whereas cPTH decreased it (-29%, p = 0.009). iPTH increased bone perfusion (27%, p < 0.001) with no change in BP, whereas cPTH did not. The vascular effects of a 15-day iPTH treatment were analyzed in OVX mice and compared with sham-operated and OVX untreated controls. Two other anti-osteoporotic drugs, zoledronate (one injection, 70\u2009\u00b5g/kg) and propranolol, (5 mg/kg/d) were tested in OVX mice. Although no change in bone mass was observed, iPTH stimulated bone formation and prevented the OVX-induced reduction in bone perfusion and vessel density. Both zoledronate and propranolol strongly lowered bone turnover, but surprisingly, zoledronate prevented OVX-induced reduction in bone perfusion but propranolol did not. Our integrative approach thus demonstrates that the effects of PTH on bone vessel structure and function depend on its mode of administration as well as on the HPG-axis hormonal status, and that OVX-induced vascular changes are prevented by iPTH.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2014-02-06", "authors": ["BernardRoche", "ArnaudVanden-Bossche", "LucMalaval", "MyriamNormand", "MartinJannot", "RobinChaux", "LaurenceVico", "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8neLafage-Proust"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2191"}

In addition, two authors reviewed together available digital ultrasound images and used pattern recognition to describe the typical ultrasound appearance of decidualized endometriomas.\nEighteen eligible women were identified.

Seventeen women (94%) were asymptomatic and one presented with pelvic pain. In three of the 18 women an ultrasound diagnosis of endometrioma had been made before pregnancy. The original ultrasound examiner was uncertain whether the mass was benign or malignant in 10 (56%) women and suggested a diagnosis of benignity in nine (50%) women, borderline in eight women (44%), and invasive malignancy in one (6%) woman. Seventeen decidualized endometriomas contained a papillary projection, and in 16 of these at least one of the papillary projections was vascularized at power or color Doppler examination.

In each limb the median artery was catheterized at the level of the carpus and India ink was injected under constant manual pressure. The limbs were frozen and 5 mm thick sections of the foot were cut in the sagittal, coronal, or transverse planes on a band saw. The sections were fixed in 10% formalin and cleared using a modified Spalteholz technique. Once cleared, the sections were photographed and the microvascular anatomy identified.\nThe vascular injections revealed a rich intra-osseous microvascular supply of the distal phalanx originating from the medial and lateral palmar digital arteries. In addition, numerous smaller vessels from the terminal arch, formed by anastomosis of the medial and lateral palmar digital arteries, could be seen branching into the distal aspects of the distal phalanx. This distal portion of the distal phalanx appeared more densely vascularized than the proximal part in all specimens examined.\nThe increased vascularity demonstrated in the distal portion of the distal phalanx appears to correlate with improved fracture healing reported in this area.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a multifactorial, stress related cardiomyopathy, rarely reported in association with thyrotoxicosis. Simultaneous occurrence of TCM and thyrotoxicosis due to hepatitis C and its treatment has never been reported.\nA 47-year-old woman was admitted for acute chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations and diaphoresis. She had been diagnosed with CHC and had undergone 7 months of IFN\u03b1 and Ribavirin therapy. At admission electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation, negative T waves and troponin was elevated suggesting ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular apical akinesia and ballooning, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%. Contrast angiography showed normal epicardial coronaries, yet a ventriculogram revealed left ventricular apical ballooning, consistent with TCM. Cardiac MRI showed left ventricle apical ballooning and no late enhancement suggesting the absence of any edema, scar or fibrosis in the left myocardium. She was diagnosed with non-autoimmune destructive thyroiditis: TSH=0.001 mU/L, free T4=2.41 ng/dl, total T3=199 ng/dl and negative thyroid antibodies. The thyroid ultrasonography showed a diffuse small goiter, no nodules and normal vascularization of the parenchyma. Following supportive treatment she experienced a complete recovery after a few weeks and she successfully completed her antiviral treatment, with no thyroid or cardiovascular dysfunction ever since. In patients treated with IFN\u03b1 for CHC, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction varies between 2.5-45.3% of cases. TCM is a stress related cardiomyopathy characterized by elevated cardiac enzymes, normal coronary angiography and an acute, transient, left ventricular apical dysfunction that mimics myocardial infarction. Most of the patients survive the initial acute event, typically recover normal ventricular function within one to four weeks and have a favorable outcome, as was the case with our patient. Thyrotoxicosis induced stress cardiomyopathy is rare and has been mostly reported in association with Graves' disease, thyroid storm, thyrotoxicosis factitia or following radioiodine therapy for toxic multinodular goiter.\nRoutine thyroid screening should be done in patients receiving IFN-alpha and Ribavirin for CHC and thyrotoxicosis should be considered as a possible and treatable underlying cause of TCM.", "journal": "BMC endocrine disorders", "date": "2014-02-05", "authors": ["Carmen SorinaMartin", "Luminita NicoletaIonescu", "Carmen GabrielaBarbu", "Anca ElenaSirbu", "Ioana MariaLambrescu", "Ioana SmaranditaLacau", "Doina RuxandraDimulescu", "Simona VasilicaFica"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6823-14-10\n10.1056/NEJMoa020047\n10.1016/j.beem.2009.07.004\n10.1089/thy.1997.7.891\n10.1536/jhj.45.889\n10.1253/circj.71.990\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.01.023\n10.1111/j.1440-1746.2009.05812.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2002.00974.x\n10.2459/JCM.0b013e3283403454\n10.1016/j.recesp.2011.01.003\n10.1089/thy.2009.0444\n10.1093/qjmed/hcq099\n10.3810/pgm.2009.05.2012\n10.1007/s12630-013-9964-0\n10.1089/thy.2012.0101\n10.1378/chest.07-0608\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2007.07.002\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfp008\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl032\n10.1016/j.ahj.2007.11.008\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl570\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.16\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.062\n10.4158/EP.14.9.1137\n10.1136/hrt.74.6.700\n10.1056/NEJM200102153440707\n10.1089/thy.2007.0252\n10.1089/105072502760143809\n10.1111/j.1365-2265.2006.02514.x\n10.1210/en.2003-1670\n10.1161/01.RES.69.5.1234\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.10.041\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.03.050"}

The logical approach to suppress T1D is to inactivate or eliminate the lymphocytes responsible for inducing inflammation and targeting the \u03b2\u2011cells. Antigen-specific approaches have been devised and were able to target inflammatory lymphocytes and induce apoptosis or block trafficking to pancreatic islets. Lack of costimulation, expansion of Tregs and bystander suppression are likely mechanisms by which antigen-specific treatments modulate pathogenic T cells. This strategy, however, while prevents the onset of T1D, could not overcome overt T1D, perhaps because of collateral damage to the islet vascular network.

Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation.

{"title": "Targeting the synovial angiogenesis as a novel treatment approach to osteoarthritis.", "abstract": "Synovitis is a key feature in osteoarthritis and is associated with symptom severity. Synovial membrane inflammation is secondary to cartilage degradation which occurs in the early stage and is located adjacent to cartilage damage. This inflammation is characterized by the invasion and activation of macrophages and lymphocytes, the release in the joint cavity of large amounts of pro-inflammatory and procatabolic mediators, and by a local increase of synovial membrane vascularity. This latter process plays an important role in the chronicity of the inflammatory reaction by facilitating the invasion of the synovium by immune cells. Therefore, synovial membrane angiogenesis represents a key target for the treatment of osteoarthritis. This paper is a narrative review of the literature referenced in PubMed during the past 5 years.

{"title": "Silicate bioceramics enhanced vascularization and osteogenesis through stimulating interactions between endothelia cells and bone marrow stromal cells.", "abstract": "The facts that biomaterials affect the behavior of single type of cells have been widely accepted. However, the effects of biomaterials on cell-cell interactions have rarely been reported. Bone tissue engineering involves osteoblastic cells (OCs), endothelial cells (ECs) and the interactions between OCs and ECs. It has been reported that silicate biomaterials can stimulate osteogenic differentiation of OCs and vascularization of ECs. However, the effects of silicate biomaterials on the interactions between ECs and OCs during vascularization and osteogenesis have not been reported, which are critical for bone tissue regeneration in\u00a0vivo. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of calcium silicate (CS) bioceramics on interactions between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) and on stimulation of vascularization and osteogenesis in\u00a0vivo through combining co-cultures with CS containing scaffolds. Specifically, the effects of CS on the angiogenic growth factor VEGF, osteogenic growth factor BMP-2 and the cross-talks between VEGF and BMP-2 in the co-culture system were elucidated. Results showed that CS stimulated co-cultured HBMSCs (co-HBMSCs) to express VEGF and the VEGF activated its receptor KDR on co-cultured HUVECs (co-HUVECs), which was also up-regulated by CS. Then, BMP-2 and nitric oxide expression from the co-HUVECs were stimulated by CS and the former stimulated osteogenic differentiation of co-HBMSCs while the latter stimulated vascularization of co-HVUECs. Finally, the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/CS composite scaffolds with the co-cultured HBMSCs and HUVECs significantly enhanced vascularization and osteogenic differentiation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, which indicates that it is a promising way to enhance bone regeneration by combining scaffolds containing silicate bioceramics and co-cultures of ECs and OCs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-02-04", "authors": ["HaiyanLi", "KeXue", "NiKong", "KaiLiu", "JiangChang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.039"}

{"title": "Activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis may drive vascularization of the ovine placenta.", "abstract": "Early pregnancy, when most embryonic losses occur, is a critical period in which vital placental vascularization is established. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of angiogenesis, and factors that regulate VEGF function, expression, or both may ultimately affect vascularization. Activation of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by its cognate ligand, C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), increases VEGF synthesis and secretion, which in turn stimulates CXCL12 and CXCR4 production and this synergistic regulation may influence placental vascularization. We hypothesized that expression of CXCL12, CXCR4, select angiogenic factors, and their receptors would increase in placental tissues during early pregnancy and that treatment of ovine trophectoderm cells with CXCL12 would increase production of angiogenic factors. To test this hypothesis, maternal caruncle (CAR) and fetal extraembryonic membrane (FM) tissues were collected on days 18, 20, 22, 25, 26, and 30 of pregnancy and on day 10 of the estrous cycle (control, NP) to determine relative mRNA or protein expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 and selected angiogenic factors. In CAR, expression of mRNA for CXCR4 increased on day 18, 20, 22, and 25 and CXCL12 increased on day 18 and 20 compared with NP ewes. CXCL12 protein followed a similar pattern in CAR tissue, with greater levels on day 20 than in NP tissue. Greater levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) mRNA was observed in CAR on day 20 of gestation than on day 30. In FM, CXCL12, CXCR4, angiopoietin 1, VEGF, and VEGF receptor 1 were enhanced with advancing pregnancy, whereas FGF2 and kinase insert domain receptor (or VEGF receptor 2) peaked on day 25. An increase in protein levels occurred on day 25 compared with day 20 in FM for CXCL12 and CXCR4, as well as a similar tendency for FGF2 protein.

The use of stem cells to treat this condition represents a promising new therapeutic strategy; therefore, a variety of stem cell treatments have been recently examined in animal models of CNS trauma. In this work, we analyzed the effects of third trimester amniotic fluid cells in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. Among the different cultures used for transplantation, some were able to induce a significant improvement in motor recovery (cultures #3.5, #3.6 and #7.30), evaluated by means of open field free locomotion. All effective cell cultures expressed the surface marker nerve/glial antigen 2, ortholog of the human chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, which is present on several types of immature progenitor cells. The improved motor functional recovery was correlated with higher myelin preservation in the ventral horn white matter and an increased vascularization in the peri-lesion area. Real-Time PCR analysis showed higher expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 mRNA two days after cells transplantation compared to PBS-treated animals, indicating that an angiogenic pathway might have been activated by these cells, possibly through the production of hepatocyte growth factor. This cytokine appears to be produced mostly in filtering organs, such as the lung, of the transplanted animals and is likely released in the blood suggesting an endocrine role of hepatocyte growth factor in targeting the injury site.", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "date": "2014-02-04", "authors": ["DanieleBottai", "GiuseppeScesa", "DanielaCigognini", "RaffaellaAdami", "EmanuelaNicora", "SergioAbrignani", "Anna MariaDi Giulio", "AlfredoGorio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.01.015"}

Original radioanatomical and NanoSPECT-CT Bioscan microvascular study].", "abstract": "The composite radial forearm flap is a surgical option in the reconstruction of large traumatic or oncologic orofacial defects. Nevertheless, it has been criticized for its poor bone transport faculties that would make this flap insufficient in large osseous mandibular reconstructions, or for oral prosthetic rehabilitation with dental implants. What is more, the morbidity of the donor site has often been pointed. The aim of this radioanatomic study was to revisit the vascularization of the composite radial forearm flap, focusing on the bone stick.\nA radioanatomic study was performed on seven upper limbs taken from fresh cadavers. First, the vessels were washed with a 40\u00b0C solution of potassium acetate. Then an intra-arterial injection of a mixture of lead oxide and agar-agar was performed. 3D-CT-scan examinations of the anatomical pieces were performed. In a second step, the flaps were harvested and analyzed with a Microscan examination (NanoSPECT-CT Bioscan(\u00ae), voxel 220\u00a0microns). Collateral branches of the radial artery to the bone and the skin were counted and classified.\nOne radial diaphyseal artery was present in all the cases. The nutrient foramen took place at the anteromedial aspect of the diaphysis, between 45\u00a0and 65\u00a0% of the length of the bone. A dense anastomotic periosteal network was highlightened, supplied by one to four musculoperiosteal branches, and one to six fascio-periosteal arteries arising from the radial artery. A total of mean five osseous branches, and 12\u00a0cutaneous branches have been observed.\nThe results of the present preclinical study suggested that a 16-cm bone stick could be harvested with an optimal vascular safety, without consideration for the morbidity at the donor site. The original approach in this study, relating anatomy to the preclinical imaging, allowed a precise visualization of the microvascularization of the soft and hard tissues.

The BAM scaffold conjugated with bFGF (CL-BAM/bFGF) could bind more bFGF and achieve controlled release of bFGF, which promoted human fibroblasts to proliferate in vitro and accelerated cellularization and vascularization after subcutaneous implantation. Using the rat bladder reconstruction model, the CL-BAM/bFGF group showed better tissue regeneration compared with the other groups.

This study was to determine stability of tibial defect reconstruction with fibular graft (FG) of different lengths by single free vascularized fibular graft (SFVFG) and double-barrel free vascularized fibular graft (DBFVFG). The left lower extremity of a male volunteer was scanned with computer tomography scanner. The contours of the tibia and fibula were extracted and the geometry of both bones rebuilt. From this intact model, the models of tibial defect reconstruction with fibular graft and external fixation were developed. Inter-fragmentary motion (IFM) and Von Mises stress on the fibular bone flap, and the locations of maximum Von Mises stress were introduced to quantify the biomechanical environment. Under the condition of the same graft length, the Von Mises stress value in DBFVFG group was 1.37 to 1.77 times higher than that in SFVFG group. When the length of graft was greater than 15 cm in the SFVFG group, the IFM exceeded 1 mm, but the IFM of the graft in the DBFVFG group was always less than 1 mm. The maximum Von Mises stress of models was frequently located at the second or third pin-bone interface. Thus, external fixation can provide a stable biomechanical environment for the reconstruction of tibial defect by both SFVFG and DBFVFG. The second or third pin-bone interface requires intensive care and that in the reconstruction of tibial defect by SFVFG, the graft length should not exceed 15 cm.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2014-02-01", "authors": ["HuiqiangChen", "YingZhang", "HongXia", "FeiWang", "ZhiboLi", "XuxiangChen"], "doi": null}

This research is performed in the bigger scope of a revascularization project of Thiel embalmed specimens. This technique enables teaching anatomy, practicing surgical procedures and doing research under lifelike circumstances.\nAfter cannulation of the pulmonary trunk and the left atrium, the vascular system was flushed with paraffinum perliquidum (PP) through a heart-lung machine. A continuous circulation was then established using red PP, during which perfusion parameters were measured. The distribution of contrast-containing PP in the pulmonary circulation was visualized on computed tomography. Finally, the amount of leak from the vascular system was calculated.\nA reperfusion of the vascular system was initiated for 37 min. The flow rate ranged between 80 and 130 ml/min throughout the experiment with acceptable perfusion pressures (range: 37-78 mm Hg). Computed tomography imaging and 3D reconstruction revealed a diffuse vascular distribution of PP and a decreasing vascularization ratio in cranial direction. A self-limiting leak (i.e. 66.8% of the circulating volume) towards the tracheobronchial tree due to vessel rupture was also measured.\nPP enables circulation in an isolated porcine lung model with an acceptable pressure-flow relationship resulting in an excellent recruitment of the vascular system. Despite these promising results, rupture of vessel walls may cause leaks. Further exploration of the perfusion capacities of PP in other organs is necessary. Eventually, this could lead to the development of reperfused Thiel embalmed human bodies, which have several applications.", "journal": "European surgical research.

{"title": "3D high-content screening for the identification of compounds that target cells in dormant tumor spheroid regions.", "abstract": "Cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. As distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. As cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to this class of anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, substances that target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of solid tumors. With three-dimensional growth conditions, multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) reproduce several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor regions. We here report the setup of a 3D cell culture compatible high-content screening system and the identification of nine substances from two commercially available drug libraries that specifically target cells in inner MCTS core regions, while cells in outer MCTS regions or in 2D cell culture remain unaffected. We elucidated the mode of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in inner MCTS core regions critically depends on extracellular glucose concentrations. Finally, combinational treatment with cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in MCTS. The data presented here shows for the first time a high-content based screening setup on 3D tumor spheroids for the identification of substances that specifically induce cell death in inner tumor spheroid core regions.

Teeth develop through interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme. The developing capillaries in the enamel organ, the dental epithelial structure, occur simultaneously by mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis at the onset of dentinogenesis. The vascular neoformation in the dental mesenchyme has been reported to start from the cap stage. However, the mechanisms of vascularization in the dental mesenchyme remain unknown. In the hope of understanding the mechanisms of the formation of dental mesenchymal vasculature, mouse lower molar germs from embryonic day (E) 13.5 to E16.5 were processed for immunostaining of CD31 and CD34, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the role of apoptosis for the vascularization in dental mesenchyme was examined by in vitro culture of E14.0 lower molars in the presence of the apoptosis inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) and a subsequent subrenal culture. Our results showed that CD31- and CD34-positive cells progressively entered the central part of the dental papilla from the peridental mesenchyme. For TEM, angioblasts, young capillaries with thick endothelium and endothelial cells containing vacuoles were observed in peripheral dental mesenchyme, suggesting vasculogenesis was taking place. The presence of lateral sprouting, cytoplasmic filopodia and transluminal bridges in the dental papilla suggested angiogenesis was also occurring. Inhibition of apoptosis delayed the angiogenic vascularization of the dental papilla. Therefore, these data demonstrated that molar mesenchyme is progressively vascularized by mechanisms of both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and apoptosis partially contributes to the vascularization of the dental papilla.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2014-01-31", "authors": ["GuohuaYuan", "LiZhang", "GuobinYang", "JingwenYang", "ChunyanWan", "LuZhang", "GuangtaiSong", "ShuoChen", "ZhiChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-013-1785-5"}

However, the nature of these exchanges has not yet been fully explored. We studied the mutual regulation between endothelial cells (EC), melanoma cells and hypoxia that dictate tumor aggressiveness and angiogenic activity. Here, we investigated the presence of bidirectional autocrine/paracrine endothelin (ET)-1/ET receptor (ETBR) signaling in melanoma cells, blood and lymphatic EC. In all these cells, hypoxia enhanced ET-1 expression, which in turn induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGF-C secretion, through the hypoxia-inducible growth factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1. Autocrine/paracrine exchanges of ET-1, VEGF-A and VEGF-C promoted tumor aggressiveness and morphological changes in blood and lymphatic EC. Furthermore, conditioned media from EC enhanced melanoma cell migration and vessel-like channel formation. This regulation was inhibited by ETBR blockade, by using the selective ETBR antagonist, or ETBR small interfering RNA (siRNA), and by VEGFR-2/-3 antibodies, indicating that ET-1, VEGF-A/VEGF-C, produced by melanoma cells or EC mediated inter-regulation between these cells. Interestingly, HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 siRNA, impaired this reciprocal regulation, demonstrating the key role of these transcriptional factors in signaling exchanges. In melanoma xenografts, the ETBR antagonist reduced tumor growth and the number of blood and lymphatic vessels. These results reveal an interplay between melanoma cells and EC mediated by ET-1 and VEGF-A/-C and coordinated by the hypoxic microenvironment through HIF-1\u03b1/2\u03b1 transcriptional programs.

Furthermore, we show that the growth-suppressing effects of ER\u03b2 agonist are also valid for human B-cell lymphomas as demonstrated in tumors derived from Granta-519 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and Raji Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. In Granta-519 MCL tumors, activation of ER\u03b2 reduced expression of BAFF and GRB7, 2 important molecules involved in B-cell proliferation and survival. Importantly, activation of ER\u03b2 inhibited angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, possibly mediated by impaired vascular endothelial growth factor C expression. Furthermore, using disseminating Raji BL cells, we show that ER\u03b2 activation reduces dissemination of grafted Raji BL tumors. We also show by immunohistochemistry that ER\u03b2 is expressed in primary MCL tissue. These results suggest that targeting ER\u03b2 with agonists may be valuable in the treatment of some lymphomas, affecting several aspects of the malignant process, including proliferation, vascularization, and dissemination.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2014-01-29", "authors": ["KonstantinYakimchuk", "Mohammad SharifHasni", "JiyuGuan", "Mark PChao", "BirgittaSander", "SamOkret"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2013-07-517292"}
{"title": "In vivo vascularization of cell sheets provided better long-term tissue survival than injection of cell suspension.", "abstract": "Cell sheets have shown a remarkable ability for repairing damaged myocardium in clinical and preclinical studies. Although they demonstrate a high degree of viability as engrafted cells in vivo, the reason behind their survivability is unclear. In this study, the survival and vascularization of rat cardiac cell sheets transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue of athymic rats were investigated temporally. The cell sheets showed significantly higher survival than cell suspensions for up to 12 months, using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system to detect luciferase-positive transplanted cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay also showed a smaller number of apoptotic cells in the cell sheets than in the cell suspensions at 1 day. Rapid vascular formation and maturation were observed inside the cell sheets using an in vivo imaging system. Leaky vessels appeared at 6 h, red blood cells flowing through functional vessels appeared at 12 h, and morphologically matured vessels appeared at 7 days. In addition, immunostaining of cell sheets with nerve/glial antigen-2 (NG2) showed that vessel maturity increased over time. Interestingly, these results correlated with the dynamics of cell sheet mRNA expression. Genes related to endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting were highly expressed within 1 day, and genes related to pericyte recruitment and vessel maturation were highly expressed at 3 days or later. This suggested that the cell sheets could secrete appropriate angiogenic factors in a timely way after transplantation, and this ability might be a key reason for their high survival.

{"title": "Cell-type-specific roles for COX-2 in UVB-induced skin cancer.", "abstract": "In human tumors, and in mouse models, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels are frequently correlated with tumor development/burden. In addition to intrinsic tumor cell expression, COX-2 is often present in fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells of the tumor microenvironment, and in infiltrating immune cells. Intrinsic cancer cell COX-2 expression is postulated as only one of many sources for prostanoids required for tumor promotion/progression. Although both COX-2 inhibition and global Cox-2 gene deletion ameliorate ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced SKH-1 mouse skin tumorigenesis, neither manipulation can elucidate the cell type(s) in which COX-2 expression is required for tumorigenesis; both eliminate COX-2 activity in all cells. To address this question, we created Cox-2(flox/flox) mice, in which the Cox-2 gene can be eliminated in a cell-type-specific fashion by targeted Cre recombinase expression. Cox-2 deletion in skin epithelial cells of SKH-1 Cox-2(flox/flox);K14Cre(+) mice resulted, following UVB irradiation, in reduced skin hyperplasia and increased apoptosis. Targeted epithelial cell Cox-2 deletion also resulted in reduced tumor incidence, frequency, size and proliferation rate, altered tumor cell differentiation and reduced tumor vascularization. Moreover, Cox-2(flox/flox);K14Cre(+) papillomas did not progress to squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast, Cox-2 deletion in SKH-1 Cox-2(flox/flox); LysMCre(+) myeloid cells had no effect on UVB tumor induction. We conclude that (i) intrinsic epithelial COX-2 activity plays a major role in UVB-induced skin cancer, (ii) macrophage/myeloid COX-2 plays no role in UVB-induced skin cancer and (iii) either there may be another COX-2-dependent prostanoid source(s) that drives UVB skin tumor induction or there may exist a COX-2-independent pathway(s) to UVB-induced skin cancer.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2014-01-29", "authors": ["JingJiao", "CarolMikulec", "Tomo-oIshikawa", "ClaraMagyar", "Darren SDumlao", "Edward ADennis", "Susan MFischer", "HarveyHerschman"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgu020"}

{"title": "The neck as a preferred recipient site for vascularized composite allotransplantation in the mouse.", "abstract": "The mouse is still considered the premier model in basic immunologic and transplant-related research. However, because of its much smaller size, the mouse has proven to be a technically difficult and physiologically fragile model from a surgical standpoint. That is why only a few studies currently use mouse models in vascularized composite allotransplantation. The purpose of this study therefore was to develop a reproducible and reliable surgical technique in the mouse for future vascularized composite allotransplantation studies.\nForty DBA/2 (H2-D) hindlimb osteomyocutanous flaps were transplanted into the right cervical region of C57BL/6 (H2-D) mice using a nonsuture cuff technique. The donor iliac artery and femoral vein were mounted with polyimide cuffs (inner diameter, 0.404 mm; wall thickness, 0.025 mm) and subsequently anastomosed to the recipient common carotid artery and external jugular vein. Immunosuppressant drugs were used postoperatively.\nThe overall success rate was 85.0 percent (34 of 40). The mortality rate was 12.5 percent (five of 40); all deaths resulted from perioperative bleeding. Only one arterial insufficiency was encountered after transplantation. The operative time was approximately 2 hours. Indefinite allograft survival (>120 days) could be achieved using a specific immunosuppressant regimen.\nThis novel mouse model allows performing vascularized composite allotransplantation with very high success and survival rates. The advantages over conventional models are multifold. A high-flow common carotid artery keeps the anastomosis patent, and diastolic suction of the heart reduces the risk of venous stasis and thrombus formation.

The authors developed a classification system and treatment algorithm that is practical and surgically applicable.\nThe majority of the transplants have been described in the surgical literature and the media, and a review of the data was performed. A classification system and a treatment algorithm were designed. Skeletal defects were defined by craniofacial osteotomies and soft-tissue defects by aesthetic facial subunits. The soft-tissue defect was subdivided into the following subunits: oral-nasal (type 1), oronasal-orbital (type 2), and full facial (type 3). The bony defects were subdivided into mandibular involvement (M), Le Fort 1 (A), Le Fort 3 (B), and monobloc (C).\nThe mechanisms of injury included trauma (n = 13), burns (n = 8), congenital deformity (n = 3), oncologic resection (n = 1), and unreported (n = 2). According to the proposed classification system: one was type 1; one was type 1-M; one was type 1-MB; two were type 2; two were type 2-B; two were type 2-MB; six were type 3; one was type 3-B; and three were type 3-MB; eight could not be classified due to a lack of data. The treatment algorithm designed a vascularized composite allotransplantation that addressed the bony and soft-tissue components.\nPatient selection for these complicated procedures, currently dependent on lifelong immunosuppression, is crucial to their success.

Recognition of diffusion limitations in thick tissues has prompted regenerative strategies that seek to accelerate establishment of a functional vasculature.

However, the mechanisms controlling the relationship of mechanical and biophysical properties of the ECM to neovessel growth during sprouting angiogenesis are just beginning to be understood. In this research, we characterized the relationship between matrix density and microvascular topology in an in vitro 3D organ culture model of sprouting angiogenesis. We used these results to design and calibrate a computational growth model to demonstrate how changes in individual neovessel behavior produce the changes in vascular topology that were observed experimentally. Vascularized gels with higher collagen densities produced neovasculatures with shorter vessel lengths, less branch points, and reduced network interconnectivity. The computational model was able to predict these experimental results by scaling the rates of neovessel growth and branching according to local matrix density. As a final demonstration of utility of the modeling framework, we used our growth model to predict several scenarios of practical interest that could not be investigated experimentally using the organ culture model. Increasing the density of the ECM significantly reduced angiogenesis and network formation within a 3D organ culture model of angiogenesis. Increasing the density of the matrix increases the stiffness of the ECM, changing how neovessels are able to deform and remodel their surroundings. The computational framework outlined in this study was capable of predicting this observed experimental behavior by adjusting neovessel growth rate and branching probability according to local ECM density, demonstrating that altering the stiffness of the ECM via increasing matrix density affects neovessel behavior, thereby regulated vascular topology during angiogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-01-28", "authors": ["Lowell TEdgar", "Clayton JUnderwood", "James EGuilkey", "James BHoying", "Jeffrey AWeiss"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0085178"}

The emerging field of modular tissue engineering aims to address this limitation by fabricating constructs from the bottom up, with the objective of recreating native tissue architecture and promoting extensive vascularization. In this paper, we report the elements of a simple yet efficient method for fabricating vascularized tissue constructs by fusing biodegradable microcapsules with tunable interior environments. Parenchymal cells of various types, (i.e. trophoblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes) were suspended in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) solutions (4%/1.5% chondroitin sulfate/carboxymethyl cellulose, or 1.5 wt% hyaluronan) and encapsulated by forming chitosan-GAG polyelectrolyte complex membranes around droplets of the cell suspension. The interior capsule environment could be further tuned by blending collagen with or suspending microcarriers in the GAG solution These capsule modules were seeded externally with vascular endothelial cells (VEC), and subsequently fused into tissue constructs possessing VEC-lined, inter-capsule channels. The microcapsules supported high density growth achieving clinically significant cell densities. Fusion of the endothelialized, capsules generated three dimensional constructs with an embedded network of interconnected channels that enabled long-term perfusion culture of the construct. A prototype, engineered liver tissue, formed by fusion of hepatocyte-containing capsules exhibited urea synthesis rates and albumin synthesis rates comparable to standard collagen sandwich hepatocyte cultures.

A vessel-like network was formed within the cell constructs, wherein HUVECs were organized around the channels in a multilayer manner, while the CMs were located in-between the channels and exhibited the characteristic morphological features of a mature cardiac fiber. Acellular scaffolds with the affinity-bound basic fibroblast growth factor were implanted subcutaneously in mice.

However, the absence of pre-vascularization and the subsequent degradation of materials often lead to the failure of in vivo application. In this study, with the assistance of hypoxia-activated human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs), pedicled muscle flaps were used as materials and pre-incubated in ventral penile subcutaneous cavity of rabbit for 3 weeks to prepare a pre-vascularized urethral construct. We found that small vessels and muscle fibres were scattered in the construct after 3 weeks' pre-incubation. The construct presented a fibrous reticular structure, which was similar to that of the corpus spongiosum under microscope examination. The produced constructs were then used as a patch graft for reconstruction of the defective rabbit urethra (experimental group), natural muscular patch was used as control (control group). Twelve weeks after the reconstructive surgery, urethrography and urethroscope inspections showed wide calibres of the reconstructed urethra in the experimental group. Histopathological studies revealed that fibrous connective tissues and abundant muscle fibres constituted the main body of the patch-grafted urethra. In contrast, in the control group, only adipose tissue was found in the stenosis-reconstructed urethra, replacing the originally grafted muscular tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first report that successfully constructed a pre-vascularized urethral construct by using hypoxia-activated hUCMSC and pedicled muscle flaps. More importantly, the pre-vascularized construct showed a good performance in urethral reconstruction when applied in vivo.

{"title": "Effects of calcium phosphate/chitosan composite on bone healing in rats: calcium phosphate induces osteon formation.", "abstract": "Vascularization of an artificial graft represents one of the most significant challenges facing the field of bone tissue engineering. Over the past decade, strategies to vascularize artificial scaffolds have been intensively evaluated using osteoinductive calcium phosphate (CaP) biomaterials in animal models. In this work, we observed that CaP-based biomaterials implanted into rat calvarial defects showed remarkably accelerated formation and mineralization of new woven bone in defects in the initial stages, at a rate of \u223c60\u2009\u03bcm/day (0.8\u2009mg/day), which was considerably higher than normal bone growth rates (several \u03bcm/day, 0.1\u2009mg/day) in implant-free controls of the same age. Surprisingly, we also observed histological evidence of primary osteon formation, indicated by blood vessels in early-region fibrous tissue, which was encapsulated by lamellar osteocyte structures. These were later fully replaced by compact bone, indicating complete regeneration of calvarial bone. Thus, the CaP biomaterial used here is not only osteoinductive, but vasculogenic, and it may have contributed to the bone regeneration, despite an absence of osteons in normal rat calvaria. Further investigation will involve how this strategy can regulate formation of vascularized cortical bone such as by control of degradation rate, and use of models of long, dense bones, to more closely approximate repair of human cortical bone.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Twelve Syrian hamsters had their right buccal pouches submitted to tumor induction with dimethylbenzanthracene and carbamide peroxide for 55 days. The animals were then divided into two groups of six animals each; group I was treated with sunitinib malate and group II (control) was remained untreated. After 4 weeks, the hamsters had their vascular networks casted by Mercox\u00ae resin and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The qualitative study of the vascular network of the control tumor-bearing pouches showed images of intussusception and sprouting angiogenesis, flattened blood vessels, abrupt variations in their diameter, and a tortuous course. The samples treated with sunitinib exhibited a qualitative reduction of the signs of vascular proliferation. In addition, these casts presented an attenuation of the morphological features observed in the untreated tumor-bearing pouches. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the pouches treated with sunitinib did not show a decrease (P > 0.05) in the vascular diameter and intervessel distances when compared with the control group. The results of the present study suggest that sunitinib may act on the vascular network of oral SCC, normalizing the blood vessels.

Disorders for which good animal models do not exist have very few drugs in development or clinical trial. Even where there are accepted, albeit imperfect models, the leap from promising preclinical drug results to positive clinical trials commonly fails, including in disorders of skeletal muscle. The main alternative model for early drug development, tissue culture, lacks both the architecture and, usually, the metabolic fidelity of the normal tissue in vivo. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility and validity of human to mouse xenografts as a preclinical model of myopathy. Human skeletal muscle biopsies transplanted into the anterior tibial compartment of the hindlimbs of NOD-Rag1(null) IL2r\u03b3(null) immunodeficient host mice regenerate new vascularized and innervated myofibers from human myogenic precursor cells. The grafts exhibit contractile and calcium release behavior, characteristic of functional muscle tissue. The validity of the human graft as a model of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is demonstrated in disease biomarker studies, showing that gene expression profiles of xenografts mirror those of the fresh donor biopsies.

{"title": "Axon guidance factor SLIT2 inhibits neural invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastasizes by neural, vascular, and local invasion routes, which limit patient survival. In nerves and vessels, SLIT2 and its ROBO receptors constitute repellent guidance cues that also direct epithelial branching. Thus, the SLIT2-ROBO system may represent a key pinch point to regulate PDAC spread. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that escaping from repellent SLIT2-ROBO signaling is essential to enable PDAC cells to appropriate their local stromal infrastructure for dissemination. Through immunohistochemical analysis, we detected SLIT2 receptors ROBO1 and ROBO4 on epithelia, nerves, and vessels in healthy pancreas and PDAC specimens, respectively. SLIT2 mRNA expression was reduced in PDAC compared with nontransformed pancreatic tissues and cell lines, suggesting a reduction in SLIT2-ROBO pathway activity in PDAC. In support of this interpretation, restoring the SLIT2 expression in SLIT2-deficient PDAC cells inhibited their bidirectional chemoattraction with neural cells, and more specifically, impaired unidirectional PDAC cell navigation along outgrowing neurites in models of neural invasion. Restoring autocrine/paracrine SLIT2 signaling was also sufficient to inhibit the directed motility of PDAC cells, but not their random movement. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated silencing of ROBO1 stimulated the motility of SLIT2-competent PDAC cells. Furthermore, culture supernatants from SLIT2-competent PDAC cells impaired migration of endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), whereas an N-terminal SLIT2 cleavage fragment stimulated such migration. In vivo investigations of pancreatic tumors with restored SLIT2 expression demonstrated reduced invasion, metastasis, and vascularization, with opposing effects produced by ROBO1 silencing in tumor cells or sequestration of endogenous SLIT2. Analysis of clinical specimens of PDAC showed that those with low SLIT2 mRNA expression exhibited a higher incidence and a higher fraction of tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes. Taken together, our findings argue that disrupting SLIT2-ROBO signaling in PDAC may enhance metastasis and predispose PDAC cells to neural invasion.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2014-01-23", "authors": ["AndreasG\u00f6hrig", "Katharina MDetjen", "GeorgHilfenhaus", "Jan LK\u00f6rner", "MartinaWelzel", "RuzaArsenic", "RosaSchmuck", "MarcusBahra", "Jane YWu", "BertramWiedenmann", "ChristianFischer"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1012"}

However, this procedure is fraught with high complication rates, including infection. While raising the previously incised scalp flap overlying the full-thickness calvarial defect, the dissection is performed within the loose areolar tissue plane beneath the galea aponeurosis, thus leaving vascularized pericranium intact over the dura.\nA total of 50 consecutive patients were treated by the senior author encompassing 46 cranioplasties using the pericranial-onlay approach, along with 4 isolated temporal soft tissue reconstructions with liquid poly-methyl-methacrylate. Of the 46 cranioplasties (>\u20095 cm), only 1 autologous bone flap developed deep infection necessitating bone flap removal (1 of 46, 2.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-11.3).

Vascularization is first observed in preantral follicles, and thereafter the vasculature markedly increases in follicles undergoing development. Neovascularization includes angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Vasculogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels by bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells. It is unclear whether vasculogenesis occurs during follicular growth. Blood vessels must be mature to be functional blood vessels. Mature blood vessels are characterized by the recruitment of pericytes. However, it is unclear where pericytes come from and whether they contribute to neovascularization in the follicle during follicular growth.

{"title": "VAN4 encodes a putative TRS120 that is required for normal cell growth and vein development in Arabidopsis.", "abstract": "Leaf venation develops complex patterns in angiosperms, but the mechanism underlying this process is largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing vein pattern formation, we previously isolated vascular network defective (van) mutants that displayed venation discontinuities. Here, we report the phenotypic analysis of van4 mutants, and we identify and characterize the VAN4 gene. Detailed phenotypic analysis shows that van4 mutants are defective in procambium cell differentiation and subsequent vascular cell differentiation. Reduced shoot and root cell growth is observed in van4 mutants, suggesting that VAN4 function is important for cell growth and the establishment of venation continuity. Consistent with these phenotypes, the VAN4 gene is strongly expressed in vascular and meristematic cells. VAN4 encodes a putative TRS120, which is a known guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPase involved in regulating vesicle transport, and a known tethering factor that determines the specificity of membrane fusion. VAN4 protein localizes at the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE). Aberrant recycling of the auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins is observed in van4 mutants. These results suggest that VAN4-mediated exocytosis at the TGN plays important roles in plant vascular development and cell growth in shoot and root.

{"title": "Mechanical interaction of angiogenic microvessels with the extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels sprout from existing blood vessels, enabling new vascular elements to be added to an existing vasculature. This review discusses our investigations into the role of cell-matrix mechanics in the mechanical regulation of angiogenesis. The experimental aspects of the research are based on in vitro experiments using an organ culture model of sprouting angiogenesis with the goal of developing new treatments and techniques to either promote or inhibit angiogenic outgrowth, depending on the application. Computational simulations were performed to simulate angiogenic growth coupled to matrix deformation, and live two-photon microscopy was used to obtain insight into the dynamic mechanical interaction between angiogenic neovessels and the extracellular matrix. In these studies, we characterized how angiogenic neovessels remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and how properties of the matrix such as density and boundary conditions influence vascular growth and alignment. Angiogenic neovessels extensively deform and remodel the matrix through a combination of applied traction, proteolytic activity, and generation of new cell-matrix adhesions. The angiogenic phenotype within endothelial cells is promoted by ECM deformation and remodeling. Sensitivity analysis using our finite element model of angiogenesis suggests that cell-generated traction during growth is the most important parameter controlling the deformation of the matrix and, therefore, angiogenic growth and remodeling. Live two-photon imaging has also revealed numerous neovessel behaviors during angiogenesis that are poorly understood such as episodic growth/regression, neovessel colocation, and anastomosis. Our research demonstrates that the topology of a resulting vascular network can be manipulated directly by modifying the mechanical interaction between angiogenic neovessels and the matrix.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2014-01-21", "authors": ["Lowell TEdgar", "James BHoying", "UrsUtzinger", "Clayton JUnderwood", "LaxminarayananKrishnan", "Brenda KBaggett", "Steve AMaas", "James EGuilkey", "Jeffrey AWeiss"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4026471\n10.1007/978-3-0348-9006-9\n10.1111/j.1365-2796.2003.01297.x\n10.1161/01.RES.0000039537.73816.E5\n10.1002/jcb.20614\n10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v33.i5.10\n10.1007/BF02621134\n10.1002/jcp.1041510106\n10.1159/000170194\n10.1161/01.HYP.31.1.162\n10.1006/mvre.1998.2122\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00233-9\n10.1016/j.mvr.2005.10.005\n10.1007/BF02723003\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000124103.86943.1e\n10.1073/pnas.76.1.514\n10.1023/A:1023889805133\n10.1126/stke.2002.119.pe7\n10.1016/S0171-9335(99)80006-5\n10.1159/000081806\n10.1006/mvre.2001.2311\n10.1016/0092-8674(89)90294-8\n10.1016/S0090-3019(00)00307-4\n10.1095/biolreprod63.1.134\n10.1093/cvr/cvn055\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.238725\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085178\n10.1080/10255842.2012.662678\n10.1115/1.4005694\n10.1115/1.3118773\n10.1115/1.3005331\n10.1089/107632704322791880\n10.1115/1.1688774\n10.1115/1.2834308\n10.1007/s12195-008-0022-x\n10.1152/ajpcell.00018.2009\n10.1007/s10456-012-9257-1\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.035"}

We reviewed 40 flexor tendon reconstructions (four flexor pollicis longus and 36 finger flexors) with vascularized FDS tendon grafts in 38 consecutive patients. The donor tendons were transferred based on the ulnar vessels as a single-stage procedure (37 pedicled flaps, three free flaps). Four patients required composite tendon and skin island transfer. Minimum follow-up was 12 months, and functional results were evaluated using a total active range of motion score. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors that could be associated with the postoperative total active range of motion. The average postoperative total active range of motion (excluding the thumbs) was 178.05\u00b0 (SD 50\u00b0). The total active range of motion was significantly lower for patients who were reconstructed with free flaps and for those who required composite tendon and skin island flap. Age, right or left hand, donor/motor tendon and pulley reconstruction had no linear effect on total active range of motion. Overall results were comparable with a published series on staged tendon grafting but with a lower complication rate. Vascularized pedicled tendon grafts/flaps are useful in the reconstruction of defects of finger flexor tendons in a single stage, although its role in the reconstructive armamentarium remains to be clearly established.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery, European volume", "date": "2014-01-18", "authors": ["P CCavadas", "AP\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda", "AThione", "CLorca-Garc\u00eda"], "doi": "10.1177/1753193413520277"}
{"title": "Therapeutic magnetic microcarriers guided by magnetic resonance navigation for enhanced liver chemoembilization: a design review.", "abstract": "This review paper describes the past, present and future design of therapeutic magnetic carriers (TMMC) being guided in the vascular network using a novel technique known as magnetic resonance navigation (MRN). This targeting method is an extension of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies. MRN, based on magnetic gradient variation, aims to navigate carriers in real-time along a pre-planned trajectory from their injection site to a targeted area. As such, this approach should minimize systemic distribution of toxic agents loaded into the carriers and improve therapeutic efficacy by delivering a larger proportion of the drug injected. MRN-compatible carriers (shape, material, size, magnetic properties, biocompatibility) have to be designed by taking into consideration the constraints of the medical task and MRN. In the past, as a proof of concept of MRN feasibility, a 1.5-mm ferromagnetic bead was guided in the artery of a living swine with a clinical MRI system. Present day, to aim at medical applications, TMMC have been designed for targeted liver chemoembolization by MRN. TMMC are 50-\u03bcm biodegradable microparticles loaded with iron-cobalt nanoparticles and doxorubicin as an antitumor drug. TMMC were selectively guided to the right or left liver lobes in a rabbit model with a clinical MRI scanner upgraded with steering coils. To treat human liver tumor, according to the theoretical MRN model, future TMMC design should take into consideration magnetic nanoparticle properties (nature and loading), MRN platform performances (gradient amplitude and rise time) and vascular hepatic network properties (blood flow velocity and geometry) to optimize the carrier diameter for efficient chemoembolization.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2014-01-18", "authors": ["PierrePouponneau", "Ga\u00eblBringout", "SylvainMartel"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-014-0972-1"}

At present, the clinical treatment for dental caries is root canal therapy. This treatment results in loss of tooth sensitivity and vitality. Tissue engineering can potentially solve this problem by enabling regeneration of a functional pulp tissue. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have been shown to be an excellent source for pulp regeneration. However, limited availability of these cells hinders its potential for clinical translation. We have investigated the possibility of using somatic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from other sources for dental pulp tissue regeneration using a biomimetic dental pulp extracellular matrix (ECM) incorporated scaffold. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and human bone marrow stromal cells (HMSCs) were investigated for their ability to differentiate toward an odontogenic lineage. In vitro real-time PCR results coupled with histological and immunohistochemical examination of the explanted tissues confirmed the ability of PDLSCs and HMSCs to form a vascularized pulp-like tissue. These findings indicate that the dental pulp stem derived ECM scaffold stimulated odontogenic differentiation of PDLSCs and HMSCs without the need for exogenous addition of growth and differentiation factors.

A retrospective chart review was performed on all myelodysplastic defects closed at the University of Chicago Medicine from 2002 to 2012. Twenty-three patients were treated: eight were closed using V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flaps, eight primarily, two with transposition flaps and five with bilateral latissimus dorsi and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flaps. Patient defect characteristics, reconstructive details, follow up time, and wound complications were analyzed. The primary closure group included eight patients. There was one minor complication and two major complications that required debridement and plastic surgery consultation in this group. The transposition group included two patients and had no wound healing issues. The latissimus and gluteus myocutaneous group included five patients and had one minor wound healing issues. The V-Y crescentic group included eight patients. There were four minor wound breakdowns in the lateral donor sites and one major wound complication involving a CSF leak, meningitis and wound breakdown that required debridement. The groups were stratified by size, <5 cm and >5 cm, and further analyzed. Bilateral V-Y crescentic rotation advancement flap is a useful option when confronted with large myelodysplastic defects.

Current techniques for quantitative analysis of vascular network structure have provided important insight into 3D vessel assembly. However, these methods typically require immunohistochemical staining, which requires sample destruction, or fluorescent cell labeling, which may alter cell behavior. The methods also may require sophisticated and expensive microscopy. More robust, easily quantifiable techniques are needed for imaging vascular networks non-invasively. We present an imaging method based on widefield optical sectioning and digital deconvolution (WOSD) that enables imaging of vascular networks in 3D culture without the use of cell labeling, staining, or sample destruction. WOSD can be performed using a standard optical microscope and allows non-invasive 3D monitoring of vascular network formation. This method is illustrated by imaging vascular networks in a 3D hydrogel system. WOSD enabled production of quantifiable 3D images of the network structure. Accuracy of the technique was evaluated by comparing data from WOSD with confocal images of fixed and fluorescently stained samples. Data for vessel length, diameter, and density are consistent between the two methods.

{"title": "[Modern breast reconstruction with endoscopically assisted latissimus dorsi flap harvesting].", "abstract": "Skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomies made immediate breast reconstruction possible on a systemic level within breast cancer surgery. Mass reconstruction needs brought by the most common malignancy in women can only be met by the use of implant-based techniques, providing excellent cosmetic results and high patient satisfaction. For these postmastectomy reconstructions the replacement of the skin is no longer a challenge, but the well vascularized, good quality soft tissue coverage of the implant. Oncoplastic breast surgery today is able to conduct oncologically radical complete removal of the glandular tissue through an incision of 6-10 cm made in the armpit, with the nearly scarless retention of the natural skin envelope of the breast, and in the same time adequate axillary staging (sentinel node biopsy/axillary lymphadenectomy) is performed, then using the same incision, the implementation of one-step or multi-step breast reconstruction is possible. During these complex interventions, the latissimus dorsi flap formed by endoscopic technique (leaving no scar on the back), rotated to the anterior chest wall can be used for total autologous reconstruction of low-volume breasts as complete coverage of implants placed under the spared skin-envelope or for revitalization of thin or radiation damaged breast skin.

{"title": "CD13 promotes mesenchymal stem cell-mediated regeneration of ischemic muscle.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, tissue-resident cells that can facilitate tissue regeneration and thus, show great promise as potential therapeutic agents. Functional MSCs have been isolated and characterized from a wide array of adult tissues and are universally identified by the shared expression of a core panel of MSCs markers. One of these markers is the multifunctional cell surface peptidase CD13 that has been shown to be expressed on human and murine MSCs from many tissues. To investigate whether this universal expression indicates a functional role for CD13 in MSC biology we isolated, expanded and characterized MSCs from bone marrow of wild type (WT) and CD13(KO) mice. Characterization of these cells demonstrated that both WT and CD13(KO) MSCs expressed the full complement of MSC markers (CD29, CD44, CD49e, CD105, Sca1), showed comparable proliferation rates and were capable of differentiating toward the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, MSCs lacking CD13 were unable to differentiate into vascular cells, consistent with our previous characterization of CD13 as an angiogenic regulator. Compared to WT MSCs, adhesion and migration on various extracellular matrices of CD13(KO) MSCs were significantly impaired, which correlated with decreased phospho-FAK levels and cytoskeletal alterations. Crosslinking human MSCs with activating CD13 antibodies increased cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers and induced FAK activation in a time dependent manner.

However, these tracers have generally been characterized in xenograft models in which integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was constitutively expressed by the tumor cells themselves. In the studies presented here, the use of (111)In-RGD2 as a tracer to image only integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression on blood vessels in the tumor was determined using tumor xenografts in which tumor cells were integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-negative.\nDOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was radiolabeled with (111)In ((111)In-RGD2), and biodistribution studies were performed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) xenograft mouse models to determine the optimal peptide dose to image angiogenesis. Next, biodistribution and imaging studies were performed at the optimal peptide dose in 3 HNSCC mouse models, FaDu, SCCNij3, and SCCNij202. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor vascular and cell surface expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and correlation analysis of vascular integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and autoradiography were completed.\nAll 3 HNSCC xenografts expressed integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 on the vessels only. The optimal peptide dose of (111)In-RGD2 was 1 \u03bcg or less for specific integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-mediated uptake of the tracer. SPECT/CT imaging showed clear uptake of the tracer in the periphery of the tumors, corresponding with well-vascularized areas of the tumor. Within the tumor, (111)In-RGD2 autoradiography coincided with vascular integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression, as determined immunohistochemically. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-mediated uptake was also detected in nontumor tissues, which, through immunohistochemical analysis, proved positive for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.\n(111)In-RGD2 allows the visualization of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 in xenograft models in which integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is expressed only on the neovasculature, such as in the HNSCC tumors. Thus, (111)In-RGD2 allows specific visualization of angiogenesis in tumor models lacking constitutive tumoral integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression but may be less useful for this purpose in many tumors in which tumor cells express integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2014-01-11", "authors": ["Samantha Y ATerry", "KeelaraAbiraj", "CathelijneFrielink", "Laura Kvan Dijk", "JohanBussink", "Wim JOyen", "Otto CBoerman"], "doi": "10.2967/jnumed.113.129668"}

The purpose was to investigate the nature and prevalence of this anomaly.\nThe existence of non-ostial thoracic intersegmental artery stenoses was evaluated in 50 angiograms; the contribution of stenosed branches to the anterior spinal artery was recorded. Angiograms performed in 3 patients with right-sided aortas were also reviewed. The topographic relationships of the upper thoracic intersegmental artery with surrounding structures were investigated in 3 cadavers.\nThirty-seven non-ostial stenoses were found in 26 patients (52%), predominantly on the left side (92%), between T3 and T8, most frequently at T4 and T5 (54%). Severe lesions were observed in 10% of cases. Patients with stenoses had fewer detectable anterior radiculomedullary arteries between T3 and T5 (35% versus 54%). Upper intersegmental artery stenoses, documented on the left side of all 3 specimens, appeared to be caused by the recurrent path of these intersegmental arteries related to the leftward position of the thoracic aorta, and by their course around reinforced paramedian longitudinal strands of the endothoracic fascia.\nUpper thoracic intersegmental artery stenoses are frequent. They result from the leftward deviation of the descending aorta and the existence of a fixed point along the course of the intersegmental arteries related to the endothoracic fascia. Because contributors to the spinal vascularization often originate at similar levels, these stenoses may play a role in the susceptibility of the upper and midthoracic spinal cord to ischemia.", "journal": "AJNR.

Studies in mice examining the role of MC function in the physiology and pathology of skin regenerative processes have obtained contradictory results. To clarify the specific role of MCs in regenerative conditions, here we used a recently developed genetic mouse model that allows conditional MC ablation to examine MC-specific functions in skin. This mouse model is based on the cell type-specific expression of Cre recombinase in connective tissue-type MCs under control of the Mcpt5 promoter and the Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor-mediated cell lineage ablation by diphtheria toxin. In response to excisional skin injury, genetic ablation of MCs did not affect the kinetics of reepithelialization, the formation of vascularized granulation tissue, or scar formation. Furthermore, genetic ablation of MCs failed to prevent the development of skin fibrosis upon bleomycin challenge. The amount of deposited collagen and the biochemistry of collagen fibril crosslinks within fibrotic lesions were comparable in MC-depleted and control mice. Collectively, our findings strongly suggest that significant reduction of MC numbers does not affect skin wound healing and bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice, and provide to our knowledge previously unreported insight in the long-debated contribution of MCs in skin regenerative processes.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2014-01-11", "authors": ["SebastianWillenborg", "BeateEckes", "J\u00fcrgenBrinckmann", "ThomasKrieg", "AriWaisman", "KarinHartmann", "AxelRoers", "Sabine AEming"], "doi": "10.1038/jid.2014.12"}

Diagnosis of vascular abnormalities at the digital level is challenging. Angiography is the gold standard for assessment of DOAD but is invasive and expensive to perform.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients referred at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) for upper extremity arterial assessment during a 27-month period. Finger-brachial index, skin blood flow (in arbitrary units [a.u.]), and skin temperature (in degrees Celsius) were recorded in each digit on the pulp at baseline and after a thermal challenge test (hand placed in a thermal box at 47.0\u00b0C for 15 minutes). Angiogram analysis was blinded and performed by a radiologist using a vascularization scale ranging from 0 (no vessel) to 4 (normal). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to define a specific cutoff point to detect DOAD. Twenty-two patients had LDF measurements and complete angiograms.\nA total of 185 digits were analyzed because some patients had only analysis of one hand. The best area under the curve (AUC) was 0.98 (range, 0.94-0.99) for postwarming skin blood flow, with a cutoff point of \u2264206 a.u.

Skin, a critical component of VCA, has consistently presented the most stringent challenge to transplant tolerance. Here, we demonstrate, in a clinically relevant miniature swine model, induction of immunologic tolerance of VCAs across MHC barriers by induction of stable hematopoietic mixed chimerism. Recipient conditioning consisted of T cell depletion with CD3-immunotoxin, and 100 cGy total body irradiation prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and a 45-day course of cyclosporine A. VCA transplantation was performed either simultaneously to induction of mixed chimerism or into established mixed chimeras 85-150 days later.

Iliosacral chondrosarcomas with involvement of the sciatic notch are sufficiently challenging tumors.

A patient with an iliosacral chondrosarcoma with lumbar spine extension is presented in this report to illustrate a novel lumbopelvic spinal construct. Following combined external pelvectomy and hemisacrectomy with contralateral L3-5 hemilaminectomy and ipsilateral pediculotomy, bicortical transvertebral body screws were substituted for the missing pedicles, resulting in the creation of \"false pedicles,\" which were further supplemented with an autologous vascularized fibular strut graft from the amputated lower limb and applied to the lateral aspect of the vertebral bodies.

Three out of seven independent cell isolates showed the ability to differentiate into osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. In vitro multipotency of an established mBMSC line was maintained over 45 passages. The osteogenic differentiation of this cell line was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of specific markers such as osteocalcin and shown to be Runx2 dependent.

{"title": "Serglycin proteoglycan is required for multiple myeloma cell adhesion, in vivo growth, and vascularization.", "abstract": "Recently, it was discovered that serglycin, a hematopoietic cell proteoglycan, is the major proteoglycan expressed and constitutively secreted by multiple myeloma (MM) cells. High levels of serglycin are present in the bone marrow aspirates of at least 30% of newly diagnosed MM patients. However, its contribution to the pathophysiology of MM is unknown. Here, we show that serglycin knockdown (by \u223c85% compared with normal levels), using lentiviral shRNA, dramatically attenuated MM tumor growth in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. Tumors formed from cells deficient in serglycin exhibited diminished levels of hepatocyte growth factor expression and impaired development of blood vessels, indicating that serglycin may affect tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, knockdown of serglycin significantly decreased MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells and collagen I. Even though serglycin proteoglycan does not have a transmembrane domain, flow cytometry showed that serglycin is present on the MM cell surface, and attachment to the cell surface is, at least in part, dependent on its chondroitin sulfate side chains. Co-precipitation of serglycin from conditioned medium of MM cells using a CD44-Fc chimera suggests that CD44 is the cell surface-binding partner for serglycin, which therefore may serve as a major ligand for CD44 at various stages during myeloma progression. Finally, we demonstrate that serglycin mRNA expression in MM cells is up-regulated by activin, a predominant cytokine among those increased in MM patients with osteolytic lesions. These studies provide direct evidence for a critical role for serglycin in MM pathogenesis and show that targeting serglycin may provide a novel therapeutic approach for MM.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-01-10", "authors": ["AnuragPurushothaman", "Bryan PToole"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M113.532143"}
{"title": "Prefabrication and prelamination strategies for the reconstruction of complex defects of trachea and larynx.", "abstract": "Complex tracheal and laryngeal defects can be reconstructed using prelamination and prefabrication techniques. Three clinical situations are described in detail in the article. In short segment restenosis defects within scarred surroundings, we restore the fibrocartilaginous defect with a radial forearm fascia flap prelaminated with buccal mucosa or cartilage. This provides a newly vascularized inner lining to the tracheal defect and restores the tubular convexity. For long segment defects we need a technique that can withstand respiratory forces. We use a heterotopic prefabrication strategy to vascularize a tracheal allograft wrapped in forearm fascia. Chimerism is created by replacing donor respiratory epithelium with buccal mucosa of the recipient. After orthotopic transfer, this chimerism allows immunosuppression to be tapered and stopped when bronchoscopy shows mucosal integrity of the new trachea, since the recipient epithelium replaces the allogeneic inner tracheal lining by means of a chronic rejection process. A distinct situation occurs after resection of a unilateral larynx tumor, which usually results in a total laryngectomy with loss of both vocal cords, since reconstruction of the hemilarynx is considered too complex. First, we prefabricate a nearby four-ring autologous tracheal segment using radial forearm fascia. In a second stage, this orthotopically vascularized trachea restores the laryngeal structure with the aim to conserve one vocal cord and thus speech. Orthotopic and heterotopic prelamination and prefabrication strategies offer efficient and reproducible solutions for the restoration of challenging short and long segment tracheal defects, as well as unilateral laryngeal defects.

TGF-\u03b2 signalling is complex and mediates both pro- and anti-tumoural activities in cancer cells depending on their context, in space and time, and their microenvironment. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway and its deregulation in PDAC and HCC development and progression at the cellular and microenvironment levels. We also summarize key preclinical and clinical data on the role of TGF-\u03b2 as a target for therapeutic intervention in PDAC and HCC, and explore perspectives to optimize TGF-\u03b2 inhibition therapy.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2014-01-08", "authors": ["CindyNeuzillet", "Armandde Gramont", "Annemila\u00efTijeras-Raballand", "Louisde Mestier", "J\u00e9romeCros", "SandrineFaivre", "EricRaymond"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.1569"}

Defeat of numerous conventional therapies to cure this cancer makes urgent to develop new tools usable by clinicians for a better management of the disease. Aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer relies on its own hallmarks: a low vascular network as well as a prominent stromal compartment (desmoplasia), which creates a severe hypoxic environment impeding correct oxygen and nutrients diffusion to the tumoral cells. To survive and proliferate in those conditions, pancreatic cancer cells set up specific metabolic pathways to meet their tremendous energetic and biomass demands. However, as PDAC is a heterogenous tumor, a complex reprogramming of metabolic processes is engaged by cancer cells according to their level of oxygenation and nutrients supply. In this review, we focus on the glycolytic activity of PDAC and the glucose-connected metabolic pathways which contribute to the progression and dissemination of this disease. We also discuss possible therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in order to cure this disease which still until now is resistant to numerous conventional treatments.", "journal": "Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2014-01-08", "authors": ["FabienneGuillaumond", "Juan LucioIovanna", "SophieVasseur"], "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2013.12.019"}

Survival of the graft was complete, the bony structures-both maxillae and part of the left mandible-and mucosal lining of the nasal cavities and hard palate could all be vascularized by connecting only the facial vessels. Twelve months after transplantation, the speech intelligibility is normal in words, but slightly impaired in sentences due to moderate hypernasality.

{"title": "Glycine inhibits angiogenic signaling in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascularized tumor with limited susceptibility to chemotherapy. Modern targeted therapies are aimed at specific properties of this neoplasm. Glycine is a simple non-essential amino acid with potential antiangiogenic effects. In this study, the amino acid's effect on angiogenic signaling in an in vitro model of HCC was evaluated. HepG2 and Huh7 cells were treated with glycine-free DMEM supplemented with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10\u00a0mM glycine. The direct effects of glycine on the viability of HCC cells were monitored using MTT assay. To detect angiogenic signaling, mRNA and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) were measured using RT-PCR and Western Blot assays. To determine whether or not glycine receptors (GlyR) played a significant role, the specific antagonist, strychnine, was used as a direct inhibitor. Western Blotting was performed to show the presence of GlyR. While there was no direct pro- or antiproliferative effect of either glycine or strychnine in both cell lines, glycine was shown to significantly decrease VEGF-A expression on mRNA and protein level up to 63\u00a0% in both cell lines. This effect was blunted by the presence of strychnine. GlyR was also identified in both cell lines. Glycine decreases GlyR-dependent, VEGF-A-mediated, angiogenic signaling in human HCC and thus might be a promising additive to chemotherapy treatment strategies for highly vascularized tumors.", "journal": "Amino acids", "date": "2014-01-07", "authors": ["HelgeBruns", "MariusPetrulionis", "DanielSchultze", "MohammedAl Saeedi", "ShiboLin", "KenyaYamanaka", "MariusAmbrazevi\u010dius", "K\u0119stutisStrupas", "PeterSchemmer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00726-013-1662-2"}
{"title": "Ultrastructural characterization of the implant interface response to loading.", "abstract": "Dynamic loading can affect the bone surrounding implants. For ultrastructural exploration of the peri-implant tissue response to dynamic loading, titanium implants were installed in rat tibiae, in which one implant was loaded while the contralateral served as the unloaded control. The loaded implants received stimulation either within 24 hrs after implantation (immediate loading) or after a 28-day healing period (delayed loading) for 4, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days. The samples were processed for histology and gene expression quantification. Compared with the unloaded control, bone-to-implant contact increased significantly by immediate loading for 28 days (p < .05), but not in case of delayed loading. No effect of loading was observed on the bone formation in the implant thread areas, on the blood vessel area, and on endosteal callus formation. Loading during healing (immediate) for 7 days induced, relative to the unloaded control, a 2.3-fold increase of Runx2 in peri-implant cortical bone (p < .01) without a change in the RANKL/Opg ratio. Loading after healing (delayed) for 7 days up-regulated Runx2 (4.3-fold, p < .01) as well as Opg (22.3-fold, p < .05) compared with the unloaded control, resulting in a significantly decreased RANKL/Opg ratio.

{"title": "Endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.", "abstract": "There are many theories regarding the ultimate cause of pre-eclampsia, and nowadays it is thought that the mechanism of pathogenesis is most likely multifactorial. The pathophysiology probably involves both fetal or placental and maternal factors. The most likely relevant factors in the pathogenesis are the abnormal development of the placenta, systemic endothelial dysfunction or cell activation, and an imbalance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic proteins with a predominance of anti-angiogenic factors. In women with pre-eclampsia, placental tissue overproduces two main anti-angiogenic proteins which enter into the maternal circulation: soluble Fms- such as tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1 or sVEGFR1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). Moreover, these patients have low circulating blood levels of two pro-angiogenic peptides: placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Adequate levels of CECs (circulating endothelial cells), EPCs (endothelial progenitor cells) and microparticles most likely play an important part in the development and regulation of vascularization in pregnancy but the exact role of these cells and micropatticles in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is unknown.

Here, we developed a 3D microfluidic model to analyze the specificity of human breast cancer metastases to bone, recreating a vascularized osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment with human osteo-differentiated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. The tri-culture system allowed us to study the transendothelial migration of highly metastatic breast cancer cells and to monitor their behavior within the bone-like matrix. Extravasation, quantified 24\u00a0h after cancer cell injection, was significantly higher in the osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment compared to collagen gel-only matrices (77.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7% vs. 37.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3%), and the migration distance was also significantly greater (50.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0\u03bcm vs. 31.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0\u03bcm). Extravasated cells proliferated to form micrometastases of various sizes containing 4 to more than 60 cells by day 5.

{"title": "Fibroblast growth factor receptors as therapeutic targets in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly vascularized tumor type that is often associated with inactivating mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene that ultimately drives pro-angiogenic signaling pathways, including the VEGF pathway. As such, new therapies indicated for RCC have largely focused on blocking angiogenesis by inhibiting this pathway. Despite the contribution of these agents to clinical outcomes in RCC, acquired resistance that stimulates tumor regrowth and revascularization quickly emerges. Resistance to VEGF inhibition appears to largely result from activation of compensatory angiogenesis pathways (including the fibroblast growth factor [FGF] pathway), providing a rationale to investigate their inhibition.\nThis review explores the role of the FGF pathway in resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy and rationale for targeting in RCC. PubMed, as well as ASCO and ESMO congress abstracts, were searched for preclinical and clinical data for FGF inhibitors in RCC.\nThe FGF pathway presents a logical target in RCC and trials of the FGF receptor inhibitors regorafenib, dovitinib, nintedanib, lenvatinib and cediranib demonstrated clinical activity.

{"title": "Vimentin as an integral regulator of cell adhesion and endothelial sprouting.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a multistep process that requires intricate changes in cell shape to generate new blood vessels. IF are a large family of proteins that play an important structural and functional role in forming and regulating the cytoskeleton. Vimentin, a major type III intermediate filament protein is expressed in endothelial and other mesenchymal cells. The structure of vimentin is conserved in mammals and shows dynamic expression profiles in various cell types and different developmental stages. Although initial studies with vimentin-deficient mice demonstrated a virtually normal phenotype, subsequent studies have revealed several defects in cell attachment, migration, signaling, neurite extension, and vascularization. Regulation of vimentin is highly complex and is driven by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and cleavage by intracellular proteases. This review discusses various novel functions which are now known to be mediated by vimentin, summarizing structure, regulation and roles of vimentin in cell adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, neurite extension, and cancer. We specifically highlight a pathway involving growth factor-mediated calpain activation, vimentin cleavage, and MT1-MMP membrane translocation that is required for endothelial cell invasion in 3D environments.

{"title": "A GFP endometriosis model reveals important morphological characteristics of the angiogenic process that govern benign and malignant diseases.", "abstract": "Endometriosis involves the growth of endometriotic tissue outside the uterine cavity, and is frequently associated with different malignancies. A well-reported alteration in the disease microenvironment is the proliferation of new blood vessels around the lesions, as part of a necessary repertory to contribute to the invasiveness and development of infiltrating endometriosis. Therefore, the establishment of a reliable experimental model is essential to elucidate the contribution of angiogenesis and to develop new therapeutic approaches to endometriosis treatment. For this purpose we transplanted endometrial fragments from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mice (n=20) into the peritoneal cavity of wild-type mice (n=20), and then analyzed the morphological changes and the process of angiogenesis. The lesions were cystic and vascularized, and showed morphological hallmarks such as endometrial glands and stroma. An increase in endometriotic lesion vascular density was revealed by immunostaining and RNAm expression for Vegf and its receptor Flk-1, and the lesions were confirmed as a tissue-donor source by GFP fluorescent cells. The same pattern was observed through staining of activated macrophages and an increase of about 25% in the number of macrophage-positive cells was also demonstrated in endometriotic lesions by flow cytometry, which concords with previous data that correlate endometriosis, angiogenesis and inflammation. According to our understanding, this is the first demonstration that the pattern of the angiogenic process in the GFP endometriosis model is very similar to that of cancer. These observations will be useful for investigation of the process of angiogenesis involved in the attachment and invasion of endometrial cells, as well as an in vivo platform model to study the effects of antiangiogenic drugs.", "journal": "Histology and histopathology", "date": "2014-01-05", "authors": ["Daniel EscorsimMachado", "Ant\u00f4nioPalumbo", "Jo\u00e3o MarcosSantos", "R\u00f4mulo MedinaMattos", "Thiago Alvesdos Santos", "Sergio HenriqueSeabra", "Leonardo da CunhaBoldrini", "Jamila AlessandraPerini", "Luiz EuricoNasciutti"], "doi": "10.14670/HH-29.903"}

Histone acetylation balance obtained through opposing actions of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases is one epigenetic mechanism controlling gene expression and is, thus, associated with disease etiology and progression. Interfering pharmacologically with HDAC activity can correct abnormalities in cell proliferation, migration, vascularization, and death.\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) represent a new class of cytostatic agents that interfere with the function of HDACs and are able to increase gene expression by indirectly inducing histone acetylation.

These biomaterials uniquely combine adaptability to various clinical applications to proven tissue regeneration properties. In the present work, the biomaterials were formulated either as hydrogel or as paste formulation and their potential as wound dressing material or as dermal substitute was assessed by two in vivo models in pig skin: The healing full-thickness punch biopsy model and the non-healing full-thickness polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) chamber model. The results clearly show that collagen deposition is induced by the presence of these biomaterials. A unique pattern of early inflammatory response, eliciting neutrophils and controlling macrophage infiltration, is followed by tissue cell colonization of the wound bed with a significant deposition of collagen fibers. The study also highlighted the importance in the use of optimal formulations and appropriate handling upon implantation. In large size, non-healing wounds, wound dermis was best obtained with the paste formulation as hydrogels appeared to be too loose to ensure lasting scaffolding properties.

Direct closure with a combination of autologous fat, local bone, and/or synthetic grafts remains the standard of care for leaks encountered at the time of surgery as well as postoperatively. The development of the vascularized nasoseptal flap as a closure technique has increased the surgeon's capacity to correct even larger openings in the dura of the sella as well as widely exposed anterior skull base defects. Yet these advances in the technical nuances for management of post-transsphenoidal CSF leak are useless without the ability to recognize a CSF leak by physical examination, clinical history, biochemical testing, or radiographic assessment. Here, we report a case of a patient who developed a CSF leak 28 years after transsphenoidal surgery, precipitated by a robotic-assisted hysterectomy during which increased intra-abdominal pressure and steep Trendelenberg positioning were both factors. Given the remote nature of the patient's transsphenoidal surgery and relative paucity of data regarding such a complication, the condition went unrecognized for several months.

We have previously shown that Wnt7b promotes osteoblast differentiation during mouse embryogenesis, and that its expression in the perichondrium is dependent on Ihh signaling. To test the hypothesis that Wnt7b may mediate some aspects of Ihh function during endochondral bone development, we activated Wnt7b expression from the R26-Wnt7b allele with Col2-Cre in the Ihh(-/-) mouse. Artificial expression of Wnt7b rescued vascularization of the hypertrophic cartilage in the Ihh(-/-) mouse, but failed to restore orthotopic osteoblast differentiation in the perichondrium. Similarly, Wnt7b did not recover Ihh-dependent perichondral bone formation in the Ihh(-/-); Gli3(-/-) embryo. Interestingly, Wnt7b induced bone formation at the diaphyseal region of long bones in the absence of Ihh, possibly due to increased vascularization in the area. Thus, Ihh-dependent expression of Wnt7b in the perichondrium may contribute to vascularization of the hypertrophic cartilage during endochondral bone development.", "journal": "Bone research", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["Kyu SangJoeng", "FanxinLong"], "doi": "10.1038/boneres.2014.4"}
{"title": "Advancements in in vitro hepatic models: application for drug screening and therapeutics.", "abstract": "The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body, performing a multitude of functions. Liver tissue engineering is a combination of various strategies that aim at generating functional liver tissue that can help restore and/or support the ailing liver as it recuperates. Conventionally, in vitro culture has involved growing cells in different media compositions or layering them on matrices largely composed of native ECM components such as collagen or Matrigel. With recent advances in technology, more sophisticated techniques are being devised that are better equipped to capture distinct features of the liver in an in vivo microenvironment. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of liver cells in 3D scaffolds, as spheroids or cell sheets, allow for a high degree of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction and an in vivo-like architecture. More recently, decellularized matrices have been used as scaffolds that support ideal cell-matrix interactions. Microfabrication technologies initially used to pattern semiconductors in the integrated circuit industry have grown out of this field and now encompass a variety of methods to etch patterns onto both 2D and 3D scaffolds to allow incorporation of custom-made features resembling the fluid network and organization in native liver. This improvisation permits for enhanced vascularization and oxygen diffusion to the in vitro liver tissue.

{"title": "Endoglin (CD105) expression differentiates between aseptic loosening and periprosthetic joint infection after total joint arthroplasty.", "abstract": "The differentiation between aseptic loosening and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total joint arthroplasty is essential for successful therapy. A better understanding of pathogenesis of aseptic loosening and PJI may help to prevent or treat these complications. Previous investigations revealed an increased vascularization in the periprosthetic membrane in cases of PJI via PET signals. Based on these findings our hypothesis was that PJI is associated with an increased neovascularization in the periprosthetic membrane. Tissue samples from periprosthetic membranes of the bone-implant interface were investigated histologically for inflammation, wear particles, vascularization and fibrosis. To identify vascular structures antibodies against CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII and CD 105 (endoglin) were applied for immunohistochemical investigations. According to a consensus classification of Morawietz the tissue samples were divided into four types: type I (wear particle induced type, n\u2009=\u200911), type II (infectious type, n\u2009=\u20097), type III (combined type, n\u2009=\u20097) and type IV (indeterminate type, n\u2009=\u20097). Patients with PJI (type II) showed a pronounced infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes in the periprosthetic membrane and an enhanced neovascularization indicated by positive immunoreaction with antibodies against CD 105 (endoglin). Tissue samples classified as type I, type III and type IV showed significantly less immune reaction for CD 105. In cases of aseptic loosening and PJI vascularization is found in different expression in periprosthetic membranes. However, in aseptic loosening, there is nearly no neovascularization with CD 105-positive immune reaction. Therefore, endoglin (CD 105) expression allows for differentiation between aseptic loosening and PJI.", "journal": "SpringerPlus", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["PhilippJansen", "TorstenMumme", "ThomasRandau", "SaschaGravius", "BenitaHermanns-Sachweh"], "doi": "10.1186/2193-1801-3-561\n10.1302/0301-620X.88B10.17933\n10.1016/j.otsr.2013.03.014\n10.1093/clinids/24.5.914\n10.1089/lrb.2012.0018\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4478\n10.1302/0301-620X.95B4.30388\n10.1007/s11999-012-2474-5\n10.1086/605593\n10.1055/s-2003-38649\n10.1007/s00393-013-1315-6\n10.1099/jmm.0.035303-0\n10.3109/17453674.2011.618908\n10.1016/S0883-5403(03)00448-0\n10.3109/17453674.2013.862460\n10.1136/jcp.2005.027458\n10.1007/s00113-003-0591-z\n10.1055/s-2003-42848\n10.1007/s00402-005-0810-x\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B1.20899\n10.1007/s11999-008-0471-5\n10.1007/s11999-011-1822-1\n10.1002/art.23915\n10.1302/0301-620X.87B4.14954\n10.1182/blood-2012-06-435347\n10.5301/ijao.5000150\n10.1016/j.prp.2010.05.015\n10.1007/PL00012413\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-421040"}

{"title": "The role of peripheral nerve fibers and their neurotransmitters in cartilage and bone physiology and pathophysiology.", "abstract": "The peripheral nervous system is critically involved in bone metabolism, osteogenesis, and bone remodeling. Nerve fibers of sympathetic and sensory origin innervate synovial tissue and subchondral bone of diathrodial joints. They modulate vascularization and matrix differentiation during endochondral ossification in embryonic limb development, indicating a distinct role in skeletal growth and limb regeneration processes. In pathophysiological situations, the innervation pattern of sympathetic and sensory nerve fibers is altered in adult joint tissues and bone. Various resident cell types of the musculoskeletal system express receptors for sensory and sympathetic neurotransmitters. Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, mesenchymal stem cells, synovial fibroblasts, and different types of chondrocytes produce distinct subtypes of adrenoceptors, receptors for vasointestinal peptide, for substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Many of these cells even synthesize neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide and are positive for tyrosine-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for biosynthesis of catecholamines. Sensory and sympathetic neurotransmitters modulate osteo-chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells during endochondral ossification in limb development. In adults, sensory and sympathetic neurotransmitters are critical for bone regeneration after fracture and are involved in the pathology of inflammatory diseases as rheumatoid arthritis which manifests mainly in joints. Possibly, they might also play a role in pathogenesis of degenerative joint disorders, such as osteoarthritis. All together, accumulating data imply that sensory and sympathetic neurotransmitters have crucial trophic effects which are critical for proper limb formation during embryonic skeletal growth. In adults, they modulate bone regeneration, bone remodeling, and articular cartilage homeostasis in addition to their classic neurological actions.", "journal": "Arthritis research & therapy", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["Susanne GGr\u00e4ssel"], "doi": "10.1186/s13075-014-0485-1\n10.1016/S8756-3282(00)00326-4\n10.1161/01.STR.0000014510.48897.7D\n10.1093/rheumatology/kem301\n10.1080/000164702317281459\n10.1359/JBMR.041108\n10.1038/80826\n10.1016/0306-3623(94)00292-U\n10.1016/0014-2999(83)90511-3\n10.1038/304129a0\n10.1124/pr.54.2.233\n10.2165/00003495-198400282-00002\n10.1097/00003086-200110001-00004\n10.1159/000046497\n10.1007/s004410050017\n10.1016/8756-3282(95)00425-4\n10.1016/j.npep.2003.09.001\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05370.x\n10.1038/nrrheum.2012.181\n10.1002/jcp.21258\n10.1136/ard.2006.063354\n10.1016/0749-8063(90)90054-H\n10.1136/ard.62.6.513\n10.1007/s11926-012-0279-x\n10.1002/jor.20498\n10.1096/fj.99-1082com\n10.1016/j.joca.2013.06.018\n10.1007/BF00270017\n10.1002/dvdy.20512\n10.1186/ar2898\n10.1002/art.30482\n10.1002/art.33449\n10.1002/art.10711\n10.1046/j.1439-0264.2002.00361.x\n10.1002/1529-0131(200009)43:9<2091::AID-ANR21>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1016/j.npep.2008.09.004\n10.1016/S0304-3940(01)01713-X\n10.1002/jcp.21317\n10.1126/science.2433770\n10.1007/BF01419729\n10.1126/science.2457950\n10.1007/s00018-005-5175-3\n10.1359/jbmr.040915\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.08.020\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04239.x\n10.1038/87887\n10.1002/jcb.21646\n10.1152/ajpendo.00515.2010\n10.1016/j.bone.2009.05.004\n10.1002/art.38695\n10.1016/j.mce.2010.03.021\n10.1016/0196-9781(88)90023-X\n10.1016/0306-4522(93)90588-7\n10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00165-3\n10.3109/17453678508993002\n10.3109/17453679408995457\n10.1016/j.matbio.2014.06.007\n10.1002/jor.20406\n10.1038/nature03398\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.2599\n10.1007/s00441-009-0784-z\n10.1556/APhysiol.97.2010.4.8\n10.1002/jor.1100150120\n10.1007/s10067-009-1258-0\n10.1016/j.npep.2007.05.003\n10.1016/j.abb.2008.11.012\n10.1074/jbc.M113.481309\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00494-X\n10.1007/s11010-014-2016-4\n10.1016/j.npep.2006.11.002\n10.1016/j.bone.2009.04.203\n10.1002/1097-4644(20010601)81:3<499::AID-JCB1063>3.0.CO;2-Y\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.003\n10.1016/j.regpep.2009.11.004\n10.3390/ijms15045874\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.135\n10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.9.1667\n10.1002/jcb.23304\n10.1016/j.npep.2010.05.002\n10.3390/ijms15046224\n10.1002/jcp.22266"}

Bone healing occurs despite periosteal stripping of the dorsal and medial surfaces of this widely articulated bone followed by osteotomy in the midsection of the bone. The objective of this study was to characterize the blood supply of the medial cuneiform.\nThirty matched pairs of adult cadaver legs, 60 legs total, were amputated below the knee, and arterial casts were created with India ink and latex. Soft tissues were debrided, allowing visualization of the extraosseous blood vessels. In 53 specimens the vascular supply to the medial cuneiform was photographed and recorded. Forty-nine specimens were then cleared using a modified Sp\u00e4lteholz technique. The intraosseous vascularity of the medial cuneiform was successfully characterized and reviewed in 48 of these specimens.\nThe extraosseous blood supply was similar to previous reports with a middle pedicle branch originating from the dorsalis pedis artery. The medial plantar and superficial medial plantar artery supplied the plantar aspect of the bone. Intraosseous analysis showed a dense capillary network throughout the cuneiform, with typically one central medial major and several minor nutrient arteries noted. Areas of hypovascularity were infrequent and when noted occurred at inconsistent locations.\nThese findings support the clinical suspicion that the medial cuneiform is well vascularized from multiple sources. The plantar blood supply is likely sufficient to allow bone healing after dorsal periosteal exposure and possible injury to the middle pedicle branch of the distal medial tarsal artery.\nA medial cuneiform opening wedge osteotomy can be used to correct forefoot deformity.

Here, we report that ADAM8 is abundantly expressed in breast tumors and derived metastases compared to normal tissue, especially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Furthermore, high ADAM8 levels predicted poor patient outcome. Consistently, ADAM8 promoted an aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in culture. In a mouse orthotopic model, tumors derived from TNBC cells with ADAM8 knockdown failed to grow beyond a palpable size and displayed poor vascularization. Circulating tumor cells and brain metastases were also significantly reduced. Mechanistically, ADAM8 stimulated both angiogenesis through release of VEGF-A and transendothelial cell migration via \u03b21-integrin activation. In vivo, treatment with an anti-ADAM8 antibody from the time of cell inoculation reduced primary tumor burden and metastases. Furthermore, antibody treatment of established tumors profoundly decreased metastases in a resection model.

To meet the clinical demand, recent attentions in the regeneration and repair of bone have been focused on the use of stem cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and circulating skeletal stem cells. Circulating stem cells are currently paid a lot of attention due to their ease of clinical setting and high potential for osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In this report, we focus on the first proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the collaborative characteristics of circulating CD34(+) cells, known as endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cell-rich population, which are capable to differentiate into both endothelial cells and osteoblasts. Transplantation of circulating CD34(+) cells provides a favorable environment for fracture healing via angiogenesis/vasculogenesis and osteogenesis, finally leading to functional recovery from fracture. Based on a series of basic studies, we performed a phase 1/2 clinical trial of autologous CD34(+) cell transplantation in patients with tibial or femoral nonunions and reported the safety and efficacy of this novel therapy.

This study used both in vivo [Wistar rats treated with 1 mg/kg nicotine from 2 wk prior to mating until gestational day (GD) 15] and in vitro (RCHO-1 cell line; treated with 10(-9) to 10(-3)M nicotine) models to examine the effects of nicotine on these pathways. At GD 15, control and treated placentas were examined for the impact of nicotine on 1) trophoblast invasion, proliferation, and degree of hypoxia, 2) labyrinth vascularization, 3) expression of key genes of placental development, and 4) expression of placental angiogenic factors. The RCHO-1 cell line was used to determine the direct effects of nicotine on trophoblast differentiation. Our in vivo experiments show that nicotine inhibits trophoblast interstitial invasion, increases placental hypoxia, downregulates labyrinth vascularization as well as key transcription factors Hand1 and GCM1, and decreases local and circulating EG-VEGF, a key placental angiogenic factor. The in vitro experiments confirmed the inhibitory effects of nicotine on the trophoblast migration, invasion, and differentiation processes and demonstrated that those effects are most likely due to a dysregulation in the expression of nicotine receptors and a decrease in MMP9 activity. Taken together, these data suggest that adverse effects of maternal smoking on pregnancy outcome are due in part to direct and endocrine effects of nicotine on the main processes of placental development and establishment of FC.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Furthermore, their self-renewal capacity was assessed in adhesion as well as in suspension. Moreover, the isolated cells were differentiated toward keratinocytes and adipocytes. To assess the regenerative capacities of EpSCs, six full-thickness skin wounds were made: three were treated with EpSCs and platelet-rich-plasma (EpSC/PRP-treated), while the remaining three were administered carrier fluid alone (PRP-treated). The dermis of EpSC/PRP-treated wounds was significantly thinner and exhibited more restricted granulation tissue than did the PRP-treated wounds.

{"title": "Preludes to brain failure: executive dysfunction and gait disturbances.", "abstract": "The progressive and insidious gait and cognitive decline seen in older individuals without overt disease may result from a combination of age-dependent neuronal changes that are often exacerbated by vascular pathomechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that slow gait and executive dysfunction are early phenomena in this decline and may further evolve to the development of falls and dementia. These early manifestations can be seen as \"brain failure\" and their co-occurrence suggests that they may share a common underlying mechanism. The authors argue that brain cortical control of motor and gait performance; and high complex cognitive functions such as executive function, share the same brain networks. Due to its particular watershed vascularization, these brain networks are highly susceptible to microvascular damage and the effects of vascular risk factors. A unified approach for evaluating and treating these two features of aging will close the gap in our understanding of cognitive-motor interactions and ultimately alter the pathways to disability. Besides the standard treatment for cognitive and mobility decline, the authors suggest that treating reversible vascular risk factors and hypertension, especially when they represent early manifestations of brain damage, has the potential to be a complementary method to prevent loss of mobility and cognitive decline in older adults.", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "date": "2013-12-25", "authors": ["ManuelMontero-Odasso", "VladimirHachinski"], "doi": "10.1007/s10072-013-1613-4"}

In adult fish, urea is produced by hepatic and extrahepatic ornithine urea cycles (OUCs). However, little is known about the urea retention mechanism in developing cartilaginous fish embryos. In order to address the question as to the mechanism of urea-based osmoregulation in developing embryos, the present study examined the gene expression profiles of OUC enzymes in oviparous holocephalan elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii) embryos. We found that the yolk sac membrane (YSM) makes an important contribution to the ureosmotic strategy of the early embryonic period. The expression of OUC enzyme genes was detectable in the embryonic body from at least stage 28, and increased markedly during development to hatching, which is most probably due to growth of the liver. During the early developmental period, however, the expression of OUC enzyme genes was not prominent in the embryonic body. Meanwhile, we found that the mRNA expression of OUC enzymes was detected in the extra-embryonic YSM; the mRNA expression of cmcpsIII in the YSM was much higher than that in the embryonic body during stages 28-31. Significant levels of enzyme activity and the existence of mitochondrial-type cmgs1 transcripts in the YSM supported the mRNA findings. We also found that the cmcpsIII transcript is localized in the vascularized inner layer of the YSM. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that the YSM is involved in urea-based osmoregulation during the early to mid phase of development in oviparous cartilaginous fish.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2013-12-24", "authors": ["WataruTakagi", "MakikoKajimura", "HironoriTanaka", "KumiHasegawa", "Justin DBell", "TesToop", "John ADonald", "SusumuHyodo"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.094649"}

So far, little is known about the development of blood and lymphatic vessels in pigmented skin analogs after transplantation. In this experimental study, we analyzed the advancement and differences of host blood and lymphatic vessel ingrowth into light- and dark-pigmented human tissue-engineered skin analogs in a rat model.\nKeratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts from light- and dark-pigmented skin biopsies were isolated, cultured, and expanded. For each donor, melanocytes and keratinocytes were seeded in ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 onto fibroblast-containing collagen gels. The skin analogs were subsequently transplanted onto full-thickness wounds of immuno-incompetent rats and quantitatively analyzed for vascular and lymphatic vessel density after 8 and 15 weeks.\nThe skin analogs revealed a significant difference in vascularization patterns between light- and dark-pigmented constructs after 8 weeks, with a higher amount of blood vessels in light compared to dark skin. In contrast, no obvious difference could be detected within the light- and dark-pigmented group when varying melanocyte/keratinocyte ratios were used. However, after 15 weeks, the aforementioned difference in blood vessel density between light and dark constructs could no longer be detected. Regarding lymphatic vessels, light and dark analogs showed similar vessel density after 8 and 15 weeks, while there were generally less lymphatic than blood vessels.\nThese data suggest that, at least during early skin maturation, keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts from different skin color types used to construct pigmented dermo-epidermal skin analogs have distinct influences on the host tissue after transplantation.

An antioxidant and apocynin, which inhibits NOX, blocked ROS generation. High levels of exogenous recombinant PEDF induced apoptosis of GCs, which was prevented by antioxidants, implying involvement of ROS.\nPEDF is emerging as an ovarian factor, which has unexpected ROS-augmenting activities in the human ovary.

At some specific sites, such as the vertebral body (VB) of the spine, the process of bone repair with implanted biomaterials is rarely reported. Recently, adipose tissue was found to be an alternative source of MSC besides bone marrow. However, the strategy of using adipose-derived stromal (ADS) cells with bioactive scaffold for the repair of spinal bone defects has seldom been studied.\nTo use a sintered poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) microspheres scaffold seeded with induced rat ADS cells to repair a bone defect of the VB in a rat model.\nBasic science and laboratory study.\nA sintered porous microspheres scaffold was manufactured by PLGA.

These assembled bioactive scaffolds then were implanted in lumbar VB bone defects in Fischer 344 rats. The ex\u00a0vivo differentiation of the cells was confirmed by von Kossa staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction.

This second period of significant bone formation happened simultaneously with collapsing of the scaffolds. It was then demonstrated histologically that vascularization early in the process and cooperation between host bone and implanted cells accompanied by collapse of the scaffold may be the factors that influence bone formation.

They are derived from the stromal mesenchyme, a progenitor population distinct from nephron stem cells. Whether mesangial cells have a distinct origin from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the pathways that govern their specification are unknown. Here we show that Notch signaling in stromal progenitors is essential for mesangial cell formation but is dispensable for the smooth muscle and interstitial cell lineages. Deletion of RBPjk, the common DNA-binding partner of all active Notch receptors, with Foxd1(tgCre) results in glomerular aneurysm and perinatal death from kidney failure. This defect occurs early in glomerular development as stromal-derived, desmin-positive cells fail to coalesce near forming nephrons and thus do not invade the vascular cleft of the S-shaped body. This is in contrast to other mutants in which the loss of the mesangium was due to migration defects, and suggests that loss of Notch signaling results in a failure to specify this population from the stroma. Interestingly, Pdgfrb-positive VSMCs do not enter the vascular cleft and cannot rescue the mesangial deficiency. Notch1 and Notch2 act redundantly through \u03b3-secretase and RBPjk in this process, as individual mutants have mesangial cells at birth.

The emerging concept of organ engineering may offer a new hope for these patients. Researchers in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are using three-dimensional whole organ scaffolds composed of allogeneic or xenogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) for engineering functional tissue suitable for transplantation. Perfusion decellularization is an approach that generates native ECM scaffolds with intact 3D anatomical architecture and vasculature. Decellularized organs provide the ideal transplantable scaffold with all the necessary microstructure and extracellular cues for cell attachment, differentiation, vascularization, and function. The present manuscript will review the role of the ECM in normal development, the concept of ECM tissue specificity, and the effect of processing methods on eventual clinical outcomes. An overview of existing challenges and future directions will also be discussed.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["Denver MFaulk", "Scott AJohnson", "LiZhang", "Stephen FBadylak"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.24532"}

{"title": "Theme and variations: amphibious air-breathing intertidal fishes.", "abstract": "Over 70 species of intertidal fishes from 12 families breathe air while emerging from water. Amphibious intertidal fishes generally have no specialized air-breathing organ but rely on vascularized mucosae and cutaneous surfaces in air to exchange both oxygen and carbon dioxide. They differ from air-breathing freshwater fishes in morphology, physiology, ecology and behaviour. Air breathing and terrestrial activity are present to varying degrees in intertidal fish species, correlated with the tidal height of their habitat. The gradient of amphibious lifestyle includes passive remainers that stay in the intertidal zone as tides ebb, active emergers that deliberately leave water in response to poor aquatic conditions and highly mobile amphibious skipper fishes that may spend more time out of water than in it. Normal terrestrial activity is usually aerobic and metabolic rates in air and water are similar. Anaerobic metabolism may be employed during forced exercise or when exposed to aquatic hypoxia. Adaptations for amphibious life include reductions in gill surface area, increased reliance on the skin for respiration and ion exchange, high affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen and adjustments to ventilation and metabolism while in air. Intertidal fishes remain close to water and do not travel far terrestrially, and are unlikely to migrate or colonize new habitats at present, although in the past this may have happened. Many fish species spawn in the intertidal zone, including some that do not breathe air, as eggs and embryos that develop in the intertidal zone benefit from tidal air emergence. With air breathing, amphibious intertidal fishes survive in a variable habitat with minimal adjustments to existing structures. Closely related species in different microhabitats provide unique opportunities for comparative studies.", "journal": "Journal of fish biology", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["K LMartin"], "doi": "10.1111/jfb.12270"}

Recent advances in high-resolution imaging enable highly detailed three-dimensional geometrical representation of the whole-tumor microvascular architecture.

We present a novel methodology that combines ex-vivo high-resolution micro-computed tomography imaging data with a bioimage informatics algorithm to track and reconstruct the whole-tumor vasculature of a human breast cancer model. The reconstructed tumor vascular network is used as an input of a computational model that estimates blood flow in each segment of the tumor microvascular network. This formulation involves a well-established biophysical model and an optimization algorithm that ensures mass balance and detailed monitoring of all the vessels that feed and drain blood from the tumor microvascular network.

These receptors make an attractive anticancer target owing to their overexpression in variety of cancer especially in prostate and breast cancer. Inhibitors of IGF signaling were subjected to clinical cancer trials with the main objective to confirm the effectiveness of these receptors as a therapeutic target. However, the results that these trials produced proved to be disappointing as the role played by the cross talk between IGF and insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathways at the receptor level or at downstream signaling level became more lucid. Therapeutic strategy for IGF-1R and IR inhibition mainly encompasses three main approaches namely receptor blockade with monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibition (ATP antagonist and non-ATP antagonist), and ligand neutralization via monoclonal antibodies targeted to ligand or recombinant IGF-binding proteins. Other drug-discovery approaches are employed to target IGF-1R, and IR includes antisense oligonucleotides and recombinant IGF-binding proteins. However, therapies with monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibition targeting the IGF-1R are not evidenced to be satisfactory as expected. Factors that are duly held responsible for the unsuccessfulness of these therapies include (a) the existence of the IR isoform A overexpressed on a variety of cancers, enhancing the mitogenic signals to the nucleus leading to the endorsement of cell growth, (b) IGF-1R and IR that form hybrid receptors sensitive to the stimulation of all three IGF axis ligands, and (c) IGF-1R and IR that also have the potential to form hybrid receptors with other tyrosine kinase to potentiate the cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, and tumor vascularization.

{"title": "Vascularization and nutrient delivery at root-knot nematode feeding sites in host roots.", "abstract": "Plants are constantly challenged by pathogens and pests, which can have a profound impact on the yield and quality of produce in agricultural systems. The vascular system of higher plants is critical for growth and for their ability to counteract changing external conditions, serving as a distribution network for water, nutrients, and photosynthates from the source organs to regions where they are in demand. Unfortunately, these features also make it an attractive target for pathogens and pests that demand access to a reliable supply of host resources. The vascular tissue of plants therefore often plays a central role in pathogen and parasite interactions. One of the more striking rearrangements of the host vascular system occurs during root-knot nematode infestation of plant roots. These sedentary endoparasites induce permanent feeding sites that are comprised of 'giant cells' and are subject to extensive changes in vascularization, resulting in the giant cells being encaged within a network of de novo formed xylem and phloem cells. Despite being considered critical to the function of the feeding site, the mechanisms underlying this vascularization have received surprisingly little attention when compared with the amount of research on giant cell development and function.

We then use this information to derive MM from PSCs.

{"title": "Connexin 36 mediates blood cell flow in mouse pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "The insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells are contained within islets of Langerhans, which are highly vascularized. Blood cell flow rates through islets are glucose-dependent, even though there are no changes in blood cell flow within in the surrounding exocrine pancreas. This suggests a specific mechanism of glucose-regulated blood flow in the islet. Pancreatic islets respond to elevated glucose with synchronous pulses of electrical activity and insulin secretion across all \u03b2-cells in the islet. Connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctions between islet \u03b2-cells mediate this synchronization, which is lost in Cx36 knockout mice (Cx36(-/-)). This leads to glucose intolerance in these mice, despite normal plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity. Thus, we sought to investigate whether the glucose-dependent changes in intraislet blood cell flow are also dependent on coordinated pulsatile electrical activity. We visualized and quantified blood cell flow using high-speed in vivo fluorescence imaging of labeled red blood cells and plasma. With the use of a live animal glucose clamp, blood cell flow was measured during either hypoglycemia (\u223c50 mg/dl) or hyperglycemia (\u223c300 mg/dl). In contrast to the large glucose-dependent islet blood velocity changes observed in wild-type mice, only minimal differences are observed in both Cx36(+/-) and Cx36(-/-) mice. This observation supports a novel model where intraislet blood cell flow is regulated by the coordinated electrical activity in the islet \u03b2-cells. Because Cx36 expression and function is reduced in type 2 diabetes, the resulting defect in intraislet blood cell flow regulation may also play a significant role in diabetic pathology.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

CGCG generally affects those younger than 30\u00a0years and occurs more frequently in women (2:1). This lesion corresponds to approximately 7% of all benign tumors of the jaws, with prevalence in the anterior region of the jaw. Aggressive lesions are characterized by symptoms, such as pain, numbness, rapid growth, cortical perforation, root resorption, and a high recurrence rate after curettage. In contrast, nonaggressive CGCGs have a slow rate of growth, may contain sparse trabeculation, and are less likely to move teeth or cause root resorption or cortical perforation. Nonaggressive CGCGs are generally asymptomatic lesions and thus are frequently found on routine dental radiographs. Radiographically, the 2 forms of CGCG present as radiolucent, expansive, unilocular or multilocular masses with well-defined margins. The histopathology of CGCG is characterized by multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by round, oval, and spindle-shaped mononuclear cells, scattered in dense connective tissue with hemorrhagic and abundant vascularization foci. The final diagnosis is determined by histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen. The preferred treatment for CGCG consists of excisional biopsy, curettage with a safety margin, and partial or total resection of the affected bone. Conservative treatments include local injections of steroids, calcitonin, and antiangiogenic therapy. Drug treatment using antibiotics, painkillers, and corticosteroids and clinical and radiographic monitoring are necessary for approximately 10\u00a0days after surgery. There are only a few cases of spontaneous CGCG regression described in the literature; therefore, a detailed case report of CGCG regression in a 12-year-old boy with a 4-year follow-up is presented and compared with previous studies.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2013-12-11", "authors": ["R\u00fabia da RochaVieira", "\u00c9der RicardoBiasoli", "Marcelo MacedoCrivelini", "Glauco IssamuMiyahara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2013.10.009"}
{"title": "Recellularization of well-preserved acellular kidney scaffold using embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "For chronic kidney diseases, there is little chance that the vast majority of world's population will have access to renal replacement therapy with dialysis or transplantation. Tissue engineering would help to address this shortcoming by regeneration of damaged kidney using naturally occurring scaffolds seeded with precursor renal cells. The aims of the present study were to optimize the production of three-dimensional (3D) rat whole-kidney scaffolds by shortening the duration of organ decellularization process using detergents that avoid nonionic compounds, to investigate integrity of extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and to enhance the efficacy of scaffold cellularization using physiological perfusion method. Intact rat kidneys were successfully decellularized after 17\u2009h perfusion with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The whole-kidney scaffolds preserved the 3D architecture of blood vessels, glomeruli, and tubuli as shown by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Micro-computerized tomography (micro-CT) scan confirmed integrity, patency, and connection of the vascular network. Collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin staining of decellularized scaffolds were similar to those of native kidney tissues. After infusion of whole-kidney scaffolds with murine embryonic stem (mES) cells through the renal artery, and pressure-controlled perfusion with recirculating cell medium for 24 and 72\u2009h, seeded cells were almost completely retained into the organ and uniformly distributed in the vascular network and glomerular capillaries without major signs of apoptosis. Occasionally, mES cells reached peritubular capillary and tubular compartment. We observed the loss of cell pluripotency and the start of differentiation toward meso-endodermal lineage. Our findings indicate that, with the proposed optimized protocol, rat kidneys can be efficiently decellularized to produce renal ECM scaffolds in a relatively short time, and rapid recellularization of vascular structures and glomeruli. This experimental setup may open the possibility to obtain differentiation of stem cells with long lasting in vitro perfusion.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Therefore the stimulation of vascularization of TEM is essential to improve survival in vivo. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment, used to improve wound healing, stimulates the secretion of angiogenic factors. In this study we evaluated the effect of daily HBO treatments on TEM for 1, 3, or 5 consecutive days. Overall histology with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed no apparent changes after one treatment. After three and five HBO treatments, the basal layer became irregular and pyknotic cells were observed. Measurements of the viable epithelium showed significant thinning after one and five treatments, however, proliferation was not affected. The angiogenic factors keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFbasic), and placental growth factor (PlGF) were significantly increased after one HBO treatment, whereas after three treatments a significant decrease of FGFbasic and PlGF was seen. After five treatments KGF, PlGF, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased.

This adaptability has spurred interest in using engineered skeletal muscle to power soft robotics devices and in biotechnology and medical applications. However, the challenges to doing this are similar to those facing the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields; specifically, how do we translate our understanding of myogenesis in vivo to the engineering of muscle constructs in vitro to achieve functional integration with devices. To do this researchers are developing a number of ways to engineer the cellular microenvironment to guide skeletal muscle tissue formation. This includes understanding the role of substrate stiffness and the mechanical environment, engineering the spatial organization of biochemical and physical cues to guide muscle alignment, and developing bioreactors for mechanical and electrical conditioning. Examples of engineered skeletal muscle that can potentially be used in soft robotics include 2D cantilever-based skeletal muscle actuators and 3D skeletal muscle tissues engineered using scaffolds or directed self-organization. Integration into devices has led to basic muscle-powered devices such as grippers and pumps as well as more sophisticated muscle-powered soft robots that walk and swim. Looking forward, current, and future challenges include identifying the best source of muscle precursor cells to expand and differentiate into myotubes, replacing cardiomyocytes with skeletal muscle tissue as the bio-actuator of choice for soft robots, and vascularization and innervation to enable control and nourishment of larger muscle tissue constructs.", "journal": "Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Tumor osteolysis was induced by in situ inoculation of Walker 256/B malignant cells. Six other rats were sham operated and served as control. Twenty days later, rats were euthanized, and femurs were collected than radiographed. Angioarchitecture [mean lumen diameter (MLD), wall thickness (WTh), Vessel number, volume, and separation (VNb, VV, and VSp respectively)] was studied by histomorphometry at 2 different positions (P1: diaphysis, and P2: metaphysis) of the operated femora. Some hematological parameters were also assessed. Walker 256/B induced marked tumor osteolysis, with cortical perforation and trabecular destruction, associated increase in bone vascularization (increases of VNb and VV and decrease of VSp). Angioarchitecture of W256/B rats was disorganized and showed large MLD and lower WTh. These effects were more prominent in P2. When compared to Sham group, significantly decreases at levels of red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), and white blood cell (WBC) were observed in W256/B rats. These results suggest that Walker 256/B cells induced tumor osteolysis, improve hypervasculature especially near the tumoral foci (P2) associated hematological disruption.

Ten non-embalmed legs from cadavers were used. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were done at the middle third of the tendon. Magnetic resonance images of the hind foot were made in 60 living subjects to analyze the morphological alterations of tendon and paratenon. The paratenon is a thick fibrous layer with few elastic fibers, continuous with the crural fascia, well vascularized and innervated. It forms a sheath around the tendon similar to a synovial layer, but less organized. Indeed, it has no complete epithelium, but only some cells producing hyaluronan, called fasciacytes. Crural fascia and paratenon can be clearly observed by MRI, appearing as homogeneous, low signal intensity bands, sharply defined in the context of subcutaneous tissue in T1-weighted sequences. The mean thickness of the crural fascia was 1.11 mm in healthy subjects and 1.30 mm in patients (p < 0.005). The mean value of paratenon thickness in patients was 1.34 mm, 0.85 in healthy (p < 0.0001). The paratenon is more highly vascularized and innervated than the tendon, supporting the hypothesis that it is the origin of pain in tendinopathy. The imaging study suggests that, an increase in the thickness of the paratenon more than 1.35 mm is predictive of paratendinopathy, even before tendon damage.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2013-12-10", "authors": ["CarlaStecco", "AlessandroCappellari", "VeronicaMacchi", "AndreaPorzionato", "AldoMorra", "AntonioBerizzi", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-013-1244-8"}
{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide mitigates reperfusion injury in a porcine model of vascularized composite autotransplantation.", "abstract": "Devastating extremity injuries are prevalent but often survivable on the modern battlefield. These complex injuries require advanced methods of reconstruction, involving prolonged ischemic periods and reperfusion injury. Using our group's validated porcine model of gracilis myocutaneous flap transplantation, this study demonstrates that an interim perfusion of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mitigates the effects of reperfusion injury in the setting of delayed restoration of blood flow.\nA gracilis myocutaneous flap (200-400 g; surface area, 250 cm\u00b2) was procured from the hind limb of a Yorkshire swine (70-90 kg, n=16). The right external carotid artery and the internal jugular vein are the recipient axis. Group 1 (control, n = 6) underwent delayed anastomosis with a 3-hour ischemic period. Group 2 (n=10) underwent a similar delayed anastomosis with an interim perfusion of H2S during the ischemic period. The animals survived for 14 days. Systemic biomarker assays for skeletal muscle tissue injury (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate transaminase) and proinflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6) provide assessment of reperfusion injury at the cellular level.\nThe control animals (3 hours of ischemia with an interim perfusion of heparinized saline) demonstrated increased levels of injury biomarkers and proinflammatory cytokines compared with the animals receiving H2S infusion and identical ischemic interval. The control flaps had a mean creatine kinase level of 280\u00b3\u00d710 U/L (\u00b180\u00d710\u00b3), compared with the H2S group, which had a mean of 99\u00d710\u00b3 U/L (\u00b114\u00d710\u00b3; P=0.0007 at postoperative day 2). lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean) were 26\u00d710\u00b3 U/L (\u00b18\u00d710\u00b3) versus 9\u00d710\u00b3 U/L (\u00b13\u00d710\u00b3; P=0.0004) and aspartate transaminase levels (mean) were 1651 U/L (\u00b1324) versus (873 U/L [\u00b1279]; P=0.0013) for the control and treatment groups, respectively.

In addition to the neoplastic cell population, PTCLs have a microenvironment component, composed of non-tumor cells and stroma, which is quantitatively and qualitatively variable, and which may have an effect on their pathological and clinical features. The best example is provided by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a designation reflecting the typical vascularization and reactive immunoblastic content of the tumor tissues. In this disease, a complex network of interactions between the lymphoma cells and the microenvironment exists, presumably mediated by the neoplastic T cells with follicular helper T-cell properties.

We describe a 78-year-old woman with such a pannus, which in the past has typically been referred to as keloidal or hypertrophic. The involved eye had only light perception, and she underwent a penetrating keratoplasty that improved her vision to 20/100. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations of a the specimen disclosed a reactive spindle cell stromal proliferation of myofibroblasts that were smooth muscle actin positive with a low Ki67 proliferation index. Desmin, caldesmon, and calponin were negative, in keeping with the incomplete myofilamentary differentiation of a myofibroblast. There was a generous admixture of CD68/163-positive histiocytes and dispersed C3/5-positive T-lymphocytes. An absence of CD138- and IgG4-positive plasma cells ruled out an IgG4-related disease. For a lesion to be keloidal, the collagen must have a thick hyaline character, sharp edges, and a sparsity of intervening cells and vessels. A hypertrophic pannus would be composed of large swollen cells not necessarily increased in number.

{"title": "Concise review: cell-based strategies in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Cellular strategies play an important role in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (BTE/RM). Variability in cell culture procedures (e.g., cell types, cell isolation and expansion, cell seeding methods, and preculture conditions before in vivo implantation) may influence experimental outcome. Meanwhile, outcomes from initial clinical trials are far behind those of animal studies, which is suggested to be related to insufficient nutrient and oxygen supply inside the BTE/RM constructs as some complex clinical implementations require bone regeneration in too large a quantity. Coculture strategies, in which angiogenic cells are introduced into osteogenic cell cultures, might provide a solution for improving vascularization and hence increasing bone formation for cell-based constructs. So far, preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell-based tissue-engineered constructs generally induce more bone formation compared with acellular constructs.

Estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, and SHBG were assayed. Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Free Estrogen Index (FEI) were calculated. The patients were randomly submitted to OC (group I; n = 21) or vaginal ring (group II; n = 19).\nUltrasonographic clitoral volume, pulsatility index (PI) of dorsal clitoral arteries, MFSQ, BDI, and hormonal and biochemical assays were analyzed.\nAfter therapy, the testosterone levels were reduced in both groups, whereas estradiol decreased only in group I women. The SHBG increased in all the subjects, and both FAI and FEI decreased. The clitoral volume decreased in all the women. The PI of the dorsal clitoral artery increased only in patients on OC. The hormonal contraception was associated, in both studied groups, with a significant decrease of the two-factor Italian MFSQ score, which was more marked in OC users. In group I subjects, there was a reduction of the number of intercourse/week and a reduction of orgasm frequency during intercourse. The pain during intercourse worsened after OC use. The vaginal ring users reported a vaginal wetness.\nSix-month treatment with hormonal contraception is associated with a diminished MFSQ score.

{"title": "Human skin cell fractions fail to self-organize within a gellan gum/hyaluronic acid matrix but positively influence early wound healing.", "abstract": "Split-thickness autografts still are the current gold standard to treat skin, upon severe injuries. Nonetheless, autografts are dependent on donor site availability and often associated to poor quality neoskin. The generation of dermal-epidermal substitutes by tissue engineering is seen as a promising strategy to overcome this problematic. However, solutions that can be safely and conveniently transplanted in one single surgical intervention are still very challenging as their production normally requires long culture time, and graft survival is many times compromised by delayed vascularization upon transplantation. This work intended to propose a strategy that circumvents the prolonged and laborious preparation period of skin substitutes and allows skin cells self-organization toward improved healing. Human dermal/epidermal cell fractions were entrapped directly from isolation within a gellan gum/hyaluronic acid (GG-HA) spongy-like hydrogel formed from an off-the-shelf dried polymeric network. Upon transplantation into full-thickness mice wounds, the proposed constructs accelerated the wound closure rate and re-epithelialization, as well as tissue neovascularization. A synergistic effect of the GG-HA matrix and the transplanted cells over those processes was demonstrated at early time points. Despite the human-derived and chimeric blood vessels found, the proposed matrix did not succeed in prolonging cells residence time and in sustaining the self-organization of transplanted human cells possibly due to primitive degradation. Despite this, the herein proposed approach open the opportunity to tackle wound healing at early stages contributing to re-epithelialization and neovascularization.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Canine and porcine whole-heart discrete arterial models were extracted from high-resolution cryomicrotome vessel image stacks. Five parameterisation methods were considered that are primarily distinguished by the level of anatomical data used in the definition of the permeability and pressure-coupling fields. Continuum multi-compartment porous perfusion model pressure results derived using these parameterisation methods were compared quantitatively via a root-mean-square metric to the Poiseuille pressure solved on the discrete arterial vasculature. The use of anatomical detail to parameterise the porous medium significantly improved the continuum pressure results. The majority of this improvement was attributed to the use of anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. It was found that the best results were most reliably obtained by using porosity-scaled isotropic permeabilities and anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields.

This study evaluated the capacity of an aligned, fibrin-based, stretch-conditioned cardiac patch consisting of either the native population or a cardiomyocyte (CM)-depleted population (i.e., CM+ or CM- patches) of neonatal rat heart cells to ameliorate left ventricular (LV) remodeling in the acute-phase postinfarction in syngeneic, immunocompetent rats. Patches were exposed to 7 days of static culture and 7 days of cyclic stretching prior to implantation. Within 1 week of implantation, both patches became vascularized, and non-CMs began migrating from CM+ patches. By week 4, patches had been remodeled into collagenous tissue, and live, elongated, donor CMs were found within grafted CM+ patches. Significant improvement in cardiac contractile function was seen with the administration of the CM+ patch (ejection fraction increased from 35.1% \u00b1 4.0% for MI only to 58.8% \u00b1 7.3% with a CM+ patch, p<0.05) associated with a 77% reduction in infarct size (61.3% \u00b1 7.9% for MI only, 13.9% \u00b1 10.8% for CM+ patch, p<0.05), and the elimination of LV free-wall thinning. Decreased infarct size and reduced wall thinning also occurred with the administration of the CM- patch (infarct size 36.9% \u00b1 10.2%, LV wall thickness: 1058.2 \u00b1 135.4 \u03bcm for CM- patch, 661.3 \u00b1 37.4 \u03bcm for MI only, p<0.05), but without improvements in cardiac function. Approximately 36.5% of the transplanted CMs survived at 4 weeks; however, they remained separated and electrically uncoupled from the host myocardium by a layer of CM-free tissue, which suggests that the benefits of CM+ patch transplantation resulted from paracrine mechanisms originating from CMs. Collectively, these observations suggest that the transplantation of CM-containing engineered heart tissue patches can lead to dramatic improvements in cardiac function and remodeling after acute MI.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Gore-Tex\u00ae is the material of choice that is traditionally used to repair thoracic defects. This material is well accepted by the recipient; however, though not rejected, it is an inert material and behaves like a 'foreign body' within the thoracic wall. By contrast, there are materials that have the potential to physiologically integrate into the host, and these materials are currently under in\u00a0vitro and also in\u00a0vivo investigation. These materials offer a gradual but complete biodegradation over time, and severe adverse inflammatory responses can be avoided. Here, we present a novel material that is a biodegradable nanocomposite based on poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles in comparison to the traditionally employed Gore-Tex\u00ae being the standard for chest-wall replacement. On a mouse model of thoracic wall resection, that resembles the technique and localization applied in humans, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles and Gore-Tex\u00ae were implanted subcutaneously and additionally tested in a separate series as a chest-wall graft. After 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks cell infiltration into the respective materials, inflammatory reactions as well as neo-vascularization (endothelial cells) were determined in six different zones. While Gore-Tex\u00ae allowed for cell infiltration only at the outer surface, electrospun poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles were completely penetrated by infiltrating cells. These cells were composed mainly by macrophages, with only 4% of giant cells and lymphocytes. Total macrophage count increased by time while the number of IL1-\u03b2-expressing macrophages decreased, indicating a protective state towards the graft. As such, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles seem to develop ideal characteristics as a material for chest-wall replacement by (a) having the advantage of full biodegradation, (b) displaying stable chest-wall structures and (c) adapting a physiological and integrating graft compared to Gore-Tex\u00ae.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["WolfgangJungraithmayr", "IsabelleLaube", "NoraHild", "Wendelin JStark", "DanielaMihic-Probst", "WalterWeder", "JohannaBuschmann"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328213513621"}

Chitosan is widely envisioned as hydrogel in biomedical fields for its bioresorbability, biocompatibility, and fungistatic and bacteriostatic properties. In this study, we report that the modulation of the polymer concentration, the degree of acetylation, the gelation processes [or neutralization routes (NR)] in the preparation of different chitosan-based hydrogels lead to substantially and significantly different biological responses. We show that it is possible to tune the physicochemical characteristics, mechanical properties, and biological responses of such matrices. Physical hydrogels prepared from highly acetylated chitosan were softer, degraded quickly in vivo, and were not suitable for in vitro culture of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor derived endothelial cells. In contrast, for a same chitosan concentration and obtained by the same processing route, a low degree of acetylation chitosan hydrogel provided a more elastic material, better cell adhesion on its surface and tissue regeneration, and restored tissue neo-vascularization as well.

These vascular networks connect at the lymphovenous (LV) junction, where lymph drains into blood and an LV valve (LVV) prevents backflow of blood into lymphatic vessels. Here we describe an essential role for platelets in preventing blood from entering the lymphatic system at the LV junction. Loss of CLEC2, a receptor that activates platelets in response to lymphatic endothelial cells, resulted in backfilling of the lymphatic network with blood from the thoracic duct (TD) in both neonatal and mature mice. Fibrin-containing platelet thrombi were observed at the LVV and in the terminal TD in wild-type mice, but not Clec2-deficient mice. Analysis of mice lacking LVVs or lymphatic valves revealed that platelet-mediated thrombus formation limits LV backflow under conditions of impaired valve function. Examination of mice lacking integrin-mediated platelet aggregation indicated that platelet aggregation stabilizes thrombi that form in the lymphatic vascular environment to prevent retrograde blood flow.

In the present study, we investigated whether this approach is affected by the cellular composition of the grafts. For this purpose, endometrial tissue fragments covered with luminal epithelium (LE(+)) and without luminal epithelium (LE(-)) were transplanted from transgenic green-fluorescent-protein-positive (GFP(+)) donor mice into the dorsal skinfold chamber of GFP(-) wild-type recipient animals to analyze their vascularization, growth and morphology by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry during a 14-day observation period. LE(-) fragments developed into typical endometriosis-like lesions with cyst-like dilated endometrial glands and a well-vascularized endometrial stroma. In contrast, LE(+) fragments exhibited a polypoid morphology and a significantly reduced blood perfusion after engraftment, because the luminal epithelium prevented the vascular interconnection with the microvasculature of the surrounding host tissue. This was associated with a markedly decreased growth rate of LE(+) lesions compared with LE(-) lesions. In addition, we found that many GFP(+) microvessels grew outside the LE(-) lesions and developed interconnections to the host microvasculature, indicating that inosculation is an important mechanism in the vascularization process of endometriosis-like lesions. Our findings demonstrate that the luminal epithelium crucially affects the vascularization, growth and morphology of endometriosis-like lesions.

We postulate that succinate/GPR91 enhances post-HI vascularization and reduces infarct size in a model of newborn HI brain injury.\nThe Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI was used. Succinate was measured by mass spectrometry, and microvascular density was evaluated by quantification of lectin-stained cryosection. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Succinate levels rapidly increased in the penumbral region of brain infarcts. GPR91 was foremost localized not only in neurons but also in astrocytes. Microvascular density increased at 96 hours after injury in wild-type animals; it was diminished in GPR91-null mice leading to an increased infarct size. Stimulation with succinate led to an increase in growth factors implicated in angiogenesis only in wild-type mice. To explain the mode of action of succinate/GPR91, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4, previously proposed in neural angiogenesis. Succinate-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression was abrogated by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a selective prostaglandin E receptor 4 antagonist. This antagonist also abolished succinate-induced neovascularization.\nWe uncover a dominant metabolic sensor responsible for post-HI neurovascular adaptation, notably succinate/GPR91, acting via prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4 to govern expression of major angiogenic factors. We propose that pharmacological intervention targeting GPR91 could improve post-HI brain recovery.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2013-11-29", "authors": ["DavidHamel", "MelanieSanchez", "Fran\u00e7oisDuhamel", "OlivierRoy", "Jean-ClaudeHonor\u00e9", "BaraaNoueihed", "TianweiZhou", "MathieuNadeau-Vall\u00e9e", "XinHou", "Jean-ClaudeLavoie", "GrantMitchell", "Orval AMamer", "SylvainChemtob"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.302131"}
{"title": "Anti-YKL-40 antibody and ionizing irradiation synergistically inhibit tumor vascularization and malignancy in glioblastoma.", "abstract": "Chemo/radiotherapies are the most common adjuvant modality treated for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) following surgery. However, the overall therapeutic benefits are still uncertain, as the mortality remains high. Elevated expression of YKL-40 in GBM was correlated with increases in mural cell-associated vessel coverage, stability and density, and decreases in vessel permeability and disease survival. To explore the potential role of YKL-40 in mural cell-mediated tumor vascularization, we employed an anti-YKL-40 neutralizing antibody (mAY) and ionizing irradiation (IR) in xenografted brain tumor models. Although single treatment with mAY or IR partially increased mouse survival, their combination led to dramatic inhibition in tumor growth and increases in mouse survival. mAY blocked mural cell-mediated vascular stability, integrity and angiogenesis; whereas IR merely promoted tumor cell and vascular cell apoptosis. Vascular radioresistance is at least partially attributed to expression of YKL-40 in mural cells. These divergent effects were also recapitulated in cultured systems using endothelial cells and mural cells differentiated from glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). Dysfunction of intercellular contact N-cadherin was found to mediate mAY-inhibited vascularization. Collectively, the data suggest that the conjunction therapy with mAY and IR synergistically inhibit tumor vascularization and progression. The evidence may shed light on a new adjuvant therapy in clinic.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["RongShao", "RalphFrancescone", "NipapornNgernyuang", "BrookeBentley", "Sherry LTaylor", "LuisMoral", "WeiYan"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgt380"}

{"title": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition delayed by E-cad to promote tissue formation in hepatic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro.", "abstract": "Hepatic differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) usually results in a single cell lineage, and the formation of liver tissues remains difficult. Here, we examine the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by epithelial cadherin (E-cad) expression in hepatic tissue formation from ESCs. E-cad was transfected into mouse ESCs to enable a stable expression of E-cad. Hepatic differentiation of ESCs was then induced by hepatic growth factors. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and EMT speed were examined to determine the differentiation process. Hepatic and angiogenesis markers, as well as differentiated cell-adhesive force were also examined to identify the hepatic tissue differentiation. In our results, E-cad expression gradually decreased in normal ESC (N-ESC) differentiation, but remained stable in the E-cad transfected ESC (EC-ESC) group. In EC-ESC differentiation, expressions of cytoplastic \u03b2-catenin and EMT were much lower and significantly prolonged. Angiogenesis markers vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and CD31/PECAM-1 were expressed only on day 5-13 in N-ESC differentiation, whereas VEGFR-1 and CD31/PECAM-1 were expressed prolonged on day 5-17 in the EC-ESC group and were coincident with the expression of hepatic markers. Finally, EC-ESC differentiation maintained multilayer-growth patterns, and abundant vascular network structures appeared and migrated in albumin-positive cell areas. The cellular adhesion forces between embryonic body cells in EC-ESC differentiation during day 13-17 were similar to those of mouse liver tissue. In conclusion, accelerated EMT due to the decreased E-cad expression may partially contribute to the failure of hepatic tissue formation in N-ESC differentiation. E-cad can act in synergy with hepatic growth factors and facilitate the early-stage formation of hepatic tissues through down-regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and delaying EMT.

To elucidate mechanisms through which NCM directs skeletal development and evolution, we made chimeras from quail and duck embryos, which differ markedly in their craniofacial morphology and maturation rates. We show that quail NCM, when transplanted into duck, maintains its faster timetable for development and autonomously executes molecular and cellular programs for the induction, differentiation, and mineralization of bone, including premature expression of osteogenic genes such as Runx2 and Col1a1. In contrast, the duck host systemic environment appears to be relatively permissive and supports osteogenesis independently by providing circulating minerals and a vascular network. Further experiments reveal that NCM establishes the timing of osteogenesis by regulating cell cycle progression in a stage- and species-specific manner. Altering the time-course of D-type cyclin expression mimics chimeras by accelerating expression of Runx2 and Col1a1. We also discover higher endogenous expression of Runx2 in quail coincident with their smaller craniofacial skeletons, and by prematurely over-expressing Runx2 in chick embryos we reduce the overall size of the craniofacial skeleton.

We found that the enteric and vascular networks initially had very distinct patterns of development. In the foregut, ENCC migrated through areas devoid of established vascular networks. In vessel-rich areas, such as the midgut and hindgut, the distribution of migrating ENCC did not support the idea that these cells followed a pre-established vascular network. Moreover, when gut vascular development was impaired, either genetically in Vegfa(120/120) or Tie2-Cre;Nrp1(fl/-) mice or using an in vitro Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26(Yfp/+) mouse model of ENS development, ENCC still colonised the entire length of the gut, including the terminal hindgut. These results demonstrate that blood vessel networks are not necessary to guide migrating ENCC during ENS development. Conversely, in miRet(51) mice, which lack ENS in the hindgut, the vascular network in this region appeared to be normal suggesting that in early development both networks form independently of each other.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2013-11-23", "authors": ["Jean-MarieDelalande", "DipaNatarajan", "BertrandVernay", "MalcolmFinlay", "ChristianaRuhrberg", "NikhilThapar", "Alan JBurns"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.11.007"}
{"title": "Micro-CT imaging of tumor angiogenesis: quantitative measures describing micromorphology and vascularization.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer, and its noninvasive visualization and quantification are key factors for facilitating translational anticancer research. Using four tumor models characterized by different degrees of aggressiveness and angiogenesis, we show that the combination of functional in\u00a0vivo and anatomical ex\u00a0vivo X-ray micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) allows highly accurate quantification of relative blood volume (rBV) and highly detailed three-dimensional analysis of the vascular network in tumors. Depending on the tumor model, rBV values determined using in\u00a0vivo \u03bcCT ranged from 2.6% to 6.0%, and corresponds well with the values assessed using IHC. Using ultra-high-resolution ex\u00a0vivo \u03bcCT, blood vessels as small as 3.4 \u03bcm and vessel branches up to the seventh order could be visualized, enabling a highly detailed and quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional micromorphology of tumor vessels. Microvascular parameters such as vessel size and vessel branching correlated very well with tumor aggressiveness and angiogenesis. In rapidly growing and highly angiogenic A431 tumors, the majority of vessels were small and branched only once or twice, whereas in slowly growing A549 tumors, the vessels were much larger and branched four to seven times. Thus, we consider that combining highly accurate functional with highly detailed anatomical \u03bcCT is a useful tool for facilitating high-throughput, quantitative, and translational (anti-) angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis research.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2013-11-23", "authors": ["JosefEhling", "BenjaminTheek", "FelixGremse", "SarahBaetke", "DianaM\u00f6ckel", "JulianaMaynard", "Sally-AnnRicketts", "HolgerGr\u00fcll", "MichalNeeman", "RuthKnuechel", "WiltrudLederle", "FabianKiessling", "TwanLammers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.10.014"}

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a switch molecule controlling HSC activation. We investigated PPAR\u03b3 regulation of angiogenic signal transduction and the molecular mechanisms involved in HSCs. Primary rat HSCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) were isolated and used in this study. Boyden chamber and tubulogenesis assays, identified that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-RhoA signaling activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was required for HSC motility and the associated vascularization. PDGF also stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and HSC-driven vascularization through signals mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 interrupted FAK-RhoA, ERK and mTOR cascades and inhibited HSC-based vascularization. Molecular evidence further revealed that PPAR\u03b3 attenuation of HSC angiogenic properties was dependent on inhibition of PDGF-\u03b2 receptor expression. We concluded that PPAR\u03b3 inhibited angiogenic signal transduction through transrepression of PDGF-\u03b2 receptor leading to reduced HSC motility, reduced VEGF expression, and thereby attenuated HSC-driven angiogenesis.

{"title": "Stem cell-derived endochondral cartilage stimulates bone healing by tissue transformation.", "abstract": "Although bone has great capacity for repair, there are a number of clinical situations (fracture non-unions, spinal fusions, revision arthroplasty, segmental defects) in which auto- or allografts attempt to augment bone regeneration by promoting osteogenesis. Critical failures associated with current grafting therapies include osteonecrosis and limited integration between graft and host tissue. We speculated that the underlying problem with current bone grafting techniques is that they promote bone regeneration through direct osteogenesis. Here we hypothesized that using cartilage to promote endochondral bone regeneration would leverage normal developmental and repair sequences to produce a well-vascularized regenerate that integrates with the host tissue. In this study, we use a translational murine model of a segmental tibia defect to test the clinical utility of bone regeneration from a cartilage graft. We further test the mechanism by which cartilage promotes bone regeneration using in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro culture experiments. Our data show that cartilage grafts support regeneration of a vascularized and integrated bone tissue in vivo, and subsequently propose a translational tissue engineering platform using chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Interestingly, lineage tracing experiments show the regenerate was graft derived, suggesting transformation of the chondrocytes into bone. In vitro culture data show that cartilage explants mineralize with the addition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) or by exposure to human vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC)-conditioned medium, indicating that endothelial cells directly promote ossification. This study provides preclinical data for endochondral bone repair that has potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in a variety of musculoskeletal diseases and injuries. Further, in contrast to the dogmatic view that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis before bone formation, our data suggest cartilage can transform into bone by activating the pluripotent transcription factor Oct4A. Together these data represent a paradigm shift describing the mechanism of endochondral bone repair and open the door for novel regenerative strategies based on improved biology.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2013-11-22", "authors": ["Chelsea SBahney", "Diane PHu", "Aaron JTaylor", "FedericoFerro", "Hayley MBritz", "BenediktHallgrimsson", "BrianJohnstone", "TheodoreMiclau", "Ralph SMarcucio"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2148"}
{"title": "A novel and essential role for Fc\u03b3RIIa in cancer cell-induced platelet activation.", "abstract": "Platelets play a role in cancer by acting as a dynamic reservoir of effectors that facilitate tumor vascularization, growth, and metastasis. However, little information is available about the mechanism of tumor cell-induced platelet secretion (TCIPS) or the molecular machinery by which effector molecules are released from platelets. Here we demonstrate that tumor cells directly induce platelet secretion. Preincubation of platelets with human colon cancer (Caco-2), prostate cancer (PC3M-luc), or breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231;MCF-7) resulted in a marked dose-dependent secretion of dense granules. Importantly, TCIPS preceded aggregation which always displayed a characteristic lag time. We investigated the role of platelet receptors and downstream molecules in TCIPS. The most potent modulators of TCIPS were the pharmacologic antagonists of Syk kinase, phospholipase C and protein kinase C, all downstream mediators of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) cascade in platelets. Supporting this, we demonstrated a central role for the immune Fc\u03b3 receptor IIa (Fc\u03b3RIIa) in mediating platelet-tumor cell cross-talk. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cancer cells can promote platelet dense-granule secretion, which is required to augment platelet aggregation.

One class of materials that improves FBR outcomes is made by sphere-templating, resulting in porous structures with uniform, interconnected 34\u00a0\u03bcm pores. With these materials we observe reduced fibrosis and increased vascularization. We hypothesized that improved healing is a result of a shift in macrophage polarization, often measured as the ratio of M1 pro-inflammatory cells to M2 pro-healing cells. In this study, macrophage polarity of 34\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants was compared to non-porous and 160\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants in subcutaneous mouse tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophages in implant pores displayed a shift towards an M1 phenotype compared to externalized cells. Macrophages in 34\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants had up to 63% greater expression of M1 markers and up to 85% reduction in M2 marker expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

One of the molecular hallmarks of triple-negative breast cancers is increased expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are implicated in many critical aspects of cancer progression including metabolism, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and stem cell maintenance. Ganetespib is a second-generation inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone that is essential for the stability and function of multiple client proteins in cancer cells including HIF-1\u03b1. In this study, human MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 triple-negative breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice that received weekly intravenous injections of ganetespib or vehicle following the development of palpable tumors. Ganetespib treatment markedly impaired primary tumor growth and vascularization, and eliminated local tissue invasion and distant metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lungs. Ganetespib treatment also significantly reduced the number of Aldefluor-positive cancer stem cells in the primary tumor. Primary tumors of ganetespib-treated mice had significantly reduced levels of HIF-1\u03b1 (but not HIF-2\u03b1) protein and of HIF-1 target gene mRNAs encoding proteins that play key roles in angiogenesis, metabolism, invasion, and metastasis, thereby providing a molecular basis for observed effects of the drug on the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.\nTriple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) respond poorly to available chemotherapy.

T11 target structure (T11TS), a bioactive molecule, has been documented as an anti-neoplastic agent in glioma-induced rats and also in human glioma in vitro. This novel molecule induces apoptosis of tumor cells by way of immune potentiation and impairs the glioma cell cycle, but its role in glioma angiogenesis has not been worked out in detail. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes promoting tumor angiogenesis by enzymatically remodeling the extracellular matrix and altering surface protein expression such as integrin \u03b1v and the matrix-bound proteins like TGF-\u03b21. The present study was formulated to assess the efficacy of T11TS in the modulations of MMP-2 and -9 and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) as well as modulations of integrin \u03b1v and TGF-\u03b21 in glioma-induced rats and also on the phenotypic markers of endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34).

{"title": "Upper extremity transplantation: current concepts and challenges in an emerging field.", "abstract": "Loss of an isolated upper limb is an emotionally and physically devastating event that results in significant impairment. Patients who lose both upper extremities experience profound disability that affects nearly every aspect of their lives. While prosthetics and surgery can eventually provide the single limb amputee with a suitable assisting hand, limited utility, minimal haptic feedback, weight, and discomfort are persistent problems with these techniques that contribute to high rates of prosthetic rejection. Moreover, despite ongoing advances in prosthetic technology, bilateral amputees continue to experience high levels of dependency, disability, and distress. Hand and upper extremity transplantation holds several advantages over prosthetic rehabilitation. The missing limb is replaced with one of similar skin color and size. Sensibility, voluntary motor control, and proprioception are restored to a greater degree, and afford better dexterity and function than prosthetics. The main shortcomings of transplantation include the hazards of immunosuppression, the complications of rejection and its treatment, and high cost. Hand and upper limb transplantation represents the most commonly performed surgery in the growing field of Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA). As upper limb transplantation and VCA have become more widespread, several important challenges and controversies have emerged. These include: refining indications for transplantation, optimizing immunosuppression, establishing reliable criteria for monitoring, diagnosing, and treating rejection, and standardizing outcome measures.

However, previous studies involving DAT-derived scaffolds have not fully revealed their potentials for in vivo adipose tissue construction. With the aim of developing a more efficient adipose tissue engineering technique based on DAT, in this study, we investigated the in vivo adipogenic potential of a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) delivery system based on heparinized DAT (Hep-DAT). To generate this system, heparins were cross-linked to mouse DATs by using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide and N-Hydroxysuccinimide. The bFGF-binding Hep-DATs were first tested for controlled release ability in vitro and then transplanted subcutaneously. Highly vascularized adipose tissues were formed 6weeks after transplantation. Histology and gene expression analysis revealed that majority of the Hep-DAT scaffolds were infiltrated with host-derived adipose tissues that possessed similar adipogenic and inflammatory gene expression as endogenous adipose tissues. Additionally, strong de novo adipogenesis could also be induced when bFGF-binding Hep-DATs were thoroughly minced and injected subcutaneously. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that bFGF-binding Hep-DAT could be an efficient, biocompatible and injectable adipogenic system for in vivo adipose tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2013-11-19", "authors": ["QiqiLu", "MingmingLi", "YuZou", "TongCao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.11.007"}

To detect the inflamed endothelium via imaging analysis or guide the drug to target lesions is therefore important for early diagnosis and treatment of vascular inflammatory diseases. In this study, we obtained a novel peptide NTTTH through high throughout biopanning and bioinformatic analysis. In vitro studies indicated that NTTTH homologs could especially target inflamed vascular endothelial cells, as imaging quantitative analysis indicated that the mean of integrated optical density (MIOD) and mean of stained area (MSA) were significantly higher versus control (P<0.05). In vivo studies showed that, after intravenous injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled NTTTH homologs into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed mice for 30min, NTTTH homologs were distributed in highly vascularized and inflamed organs like liver and kidney. As a control, little fluorescence could be detected in mice injected with EGFP alone. Cryosection showed that NTTTH homologs especially targeted inflamed vasculatures but not normal ones. We did not detect fluorescence signal in either normal or inflamed mice which were injected with EGFP alone.

Inadequate trophoblast invasion and vascular dysfunction are believed to be involved in preeclampsia. Axl, which interacts with its ligand Gas6, known to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and vascular angiogenesis or homeostasis and vascular network formation, may be implicated in preeclampsia, as preeclampsia is a specific vascular disease. sAxl, a soluble form of Axl, is bound to Gas6 in plasma, which inhibits the activation of the Axl-Gas6 pathway. The aim of this study was to determine the changes and significance of plasma concentrations of sAxl in severe preeclampsia, as well as its correlation with the clinical parameters of severe preeclampsia.\nFifty-eight women with severe preeclampsia and 31 healthy pregnant women were included in the study, from April 2012 to October 2012. Plasma sAxl concentrations were detected with an immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.\nPlasma sAxl concentrations were significantly higher in the preeclampsia group (61.52\u00b117.57ng/mL) than in the normal pregnancy group (45.29\u00b115.44ng/mL) (P<0.05).

Then we described the effects of miR-126 on placental vasculogenesis in preeclampsia rats, including the evaluation of placental blood perfusion using microbubbles-assisted contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), placental histology, immunohistochemistry and pregnancy outcome. Finally, we investigated the possible target gene and pathway that miR-126 modulates. Together, our results showed that preeclampsia animal with over-expressed miR-126 had higher pup weight, placenta weight and proportion of live pups. Quantification of uteroplacental perfusion by CEUS and CD34 staining of placental tissue revealed that blood volume and microvessel density increased in miR-126 treated group.

The contours of the constructs were designed digitally and transferred onto the bioartificial bone grafts using a titanium cage, which was bent over a stereolithographic model of the defined subvolume intraoperatively. At the end of the prefabrication process, only the axial vascularized constructs of group A demonstrated vital bone formation with considerable stability.

{"title": "Sustained delivery of proangiogenic microRNA-132 by nanoparticle transfection improves endothelial cell transplantation.", "abstract": "Transplantation of endothelial cells (ECs) for therapeutic vascularization or tissue engineering is a promising method for increasing tissue perfusion. Here, we report on a new approach for enhanced EC transplantation using targeted nanoparticle transfection to deliver proangiogenic microRNA-132 (miR-132) to cultured ECs before their transplantation, thereby sensitizing cells to the effects of endogenous growth factors. We synthesized biodegradable PLGA polymer nanoparticles (NPs) that were loaded with miR-132 and coated with cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptides that target integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expressed on cultured human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs), increasing NP uptake through clathrin-coated pits. Unlike previously reported NPs for miR delivery, these NPs slowly release RNA for several weeks. The endocytosed NPs remain in clathrin-coated vesicles from which they mediate intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA. Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 enhances growth factor-induced proliferation and migration in 2D culture, producing a 1.8- and 5-fold increase, respectively. However, while the effects of conventional transfection were short-lived, NP transfection produced protein knockdown and biological effects that were significantly longer in duration (\u2265 6 d). Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 NP resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of microvessels per square millimeter compared to lipid after transplantation into immunodeficient mice and led to a higher number of mural cell-invested vessels than control transfection.

{"title": "Antitumor effects of recombinant antivascular protein ABRaA-VEGF121 combined with IL-12 gene therapy.", "abstract": "Development and neoplastic progression strongly rely on tumor microenvironment cells. Various kinds of cells that form such tumor milieu play substantial roles in angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Attempts to inhibit tumor vascularization alter tumor milieu and enhance immune response against the tumor. Anticancer therapeutic strategy bringing together antiangiogenic and immunostimulating agents has emerged as a promising approach. We here investigated whether therapy directed against preexisting vessels, combined with an immunomodulatory factor would be equally effective in arresting tumor growth. To this goal, we investigated the effectiveness of ABRaA-vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 121 (VEGF121), an antivascular drug constructed by us. It is a fusion protein composed of VEGF121, and abrin A chain (translation-inhibiting toxin). We used it in combination with interleukin (IL-12) gene therapy and tried to inhibit B16-F10 melanoma tumor growth. ABRaA-VEGF121 is a chimeric recombinant protein capable of destroying tumor vasculature and triggering necrosis in the vicinity of damaged vessels. IL-12 cytokine, in turn, activates both specific and non-specific immune responses. Our results demonstrate that combination of ABRaA-VEGF121 antivascular agent with immunostimulatory cytokine IL-12 indeed inhibits tumor growth more effectively than either agent alone, leading to complete cure of ca. 20\u00a0% mice. Post-therapeutic analysis of tumors excised from mice treated with combination therapy showed decreased numbers of blood microvessels in the tumor microenvironment, lowered numbers of regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as showed higher levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) as compared to control mice.

Progesterone priming upregulates luteal vascularization; however, its effect on follicular angiogenesis is poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that progesterone priming of seasonally anoestrous ewes treated with dose multiple injections of GnRH eliminates defective luteal function by altering the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2, angiopoietin (ANG)-1, ANG-2, and TIE-2 during early and late preovulatory follicle development. Ten seasonally anoestrous ewes were given 20 mg of progesterone im 3 days before the start of GnRH treatment; 10 other animals served as controls.

Small (2-2.5 mm) and large (>2.5 mm) follicles were analyzed for protein and mRNA expression of the angiogenic factors using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays.

However, progesterone-primed animals showed significantly (P \u2264 0.05) higher levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, ANG-1, and ANG-2 in large follicles compared with nonprimed ones.

After synchronization of estrus, the ovaries of crossbred beef heifers (N = 5) were assessed using daily US with a GE Voluson i US scanner until the end of the first follicle wave, then every other day until emergence of the final (ovulatory) wave, when daily US resumed until ovulation. Follicle and CL growth were recorded and mapped. Measures of diameter (2D) and volume (3D) of the DF from the first and ovulatory waves of the cycles; and CL development were captured and stored for further analysis. Blood flow to the DF and CL were assessed using 3D power Doppler US measuring vascularization index (VI; %), vascularization flow index (0/100) and flow index (0/100). Jugular blood samples were collected every 24 hours for progesterone from the first estrus until the second ovulation. Concentrations of estradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured every 8 hours from estrus to second follicle wave emergence; then, E2 only was measured from final follicle wave emergence until ovulation. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED and PROC REG in SAS. Dominant follicle blood flow tended to decrease during follicle wave emergence and DF VI increased (P < 0.05) 24 hours before ovulation after peak E2. Measures of the DF and CL volume (3D) were highly predictive of 2D diameter measures throughout the cycle (P < 0.0001). Predictive values (r(2)) for day of wave emergence and day from ovulation were similar for 2D and 3D measures; however, 2D measures had higher repeatability when compared with 3D measures. There was no relationship between CL VI and progesterone early in the cycle (r(2) = 0.12; P = 0.1); however, there was a strong positive relationship approaching ovulation (r(2) = 0.77; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, 3D power Doppler measures of blood flow appears to be representative of vascular changes in the DF and CL throughout the estrous cycle.

Although therapeutically targeting these hypoxic environments has been proposed for many years, to date no approaches have shown the therapeutic value to gain regulatory approval. Here, we demonstrated that a novel hypoxia-activated prodrug, Q6, exhibits potent antiproliferative efficacy under hypoxic conditions and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, with no obvious toxicity being detected in 2 normal liver cell lines. Treatment with Q6 markedly downregulated HIF1A [hypoxia inducible factor 1, \u03b1 subunit (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor)] expression and transcription of the downstream target gene, VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A). This dual hypoxia-targeted modulation mechanism leads to high potency in suppressing tumor growth and vascularization in 2 in vivo models. Intriguingly, it is the autophagy-dependent degradation pathway that plays a crucial role in Q6-induced attenuation of HIF1A expression, rather than the proteasome-dependent pathway, which is normally regarded as the predominant mechanism underlying posttranslational regulation of HIF1A. Inhibition of autophagy, either by short interfering RNA (siRNA) or by chemical inhibitors, blocked Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. Autophagic degradation of HIF1A was further confirmed by the observation that HIF1A coimmunoprecipitated with the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, SQSTM1, which is degraded through autophagy. Additionally, silencing of SQSTM1 inhibited Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. These findings suggest that the novel hypoxia-targeted agent, Q6, has potential clinical value in the therapy of HCC. Furthermore, the identification of autophagy as a crucial regulator of HIF1A provides new insights into hypoxia-related treatments.", "journal": "Autophagy", "date": "2013-11-14", "authors": ["Xiao-WenLiu", "Tian-YuCai", "HongZhu", "JiCao", "YiSu", "Yong-ZhouHu", "Qiao-JunHe", "BoYang"], "doi": "10.4161/auto.26838\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0749\n10.1245/s10434-011-1570-1\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2821\n10.1038/nrc1187\n10.1002/hep.25497\n10.1038/nrc1367\n10.1007/s10555-007-9059-x\n10.1097/00042737-200505000-00002\n10.1007/s10555-010-9224-5\n10.1017/S1462399409001173\n10.1182/blood-2004-07-2958\n10.1126/science.1059796\n10.1016/j.tips.2012.01.005\n10.1038/nrd1199\n10.3390/molecules17089683\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3096\n10.1002/hep.510280111\n10.1016/j.tibs.2012.06.004\n10.1038/446745a\n10.1126/science.290.5497.1717\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2634\n10.1016/j.jhep.2011.07.031\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1439\n10.1007/s00280-012-1852-8\n10.1101/gad.2016211\n10.4161/auto.7.4.14397\n10.1074/jbc.M800102200\n10.1101/gad.521709\n10.1083/jcb.200507002"}

Five-micrometer-thick sections were made from all the samples and stained using hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff stains. A light microscopic examination was performed to study the histopathologic changes.\nThe corneal findings on clinical examination were haze, scarring, vascularization, stromal edema, pigment clumps on endothelial surface, and corneal thinning. The histopathologic evaluation revealed changes in all layers of cornea. Epithelial changes seen were intraepithelial edema, fibrosis, epithelial downgrowths, and pannus formation. The Bowman membrane was fragmented or absent. Stroma was characterized by alteration in the lamellar pattern, scarring, edema, loss of keratocytic nuclei, and calcification. The Descemet membrane was thickened to a variable extent in most specimens and there was marked loss of endothelial cells in all.\nMost histologic features are consistent with the previous few reports. The remarkable finding in all corneal specimens was a moderate to severe degree of loss of the endothelial cells.

{"title": "Significance of calcium phosphate coatings for the enhancement of new bone osteogenesis--a review.", "abstract": "A systematic analysis of results available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials on the effects of biocompatible calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings is presented. An overview of the most frequently used methods to prepare CaP-based coatings was conducted. Dense, homogeneous, highly adherent and biocompatible CaP or hybrid organic/inorganic CaP coatings with tailored properties can be deposited. It has been demonstrated that CaP coatings have a significant effect on the bone regeneration process. In vitro experiments using different cells (e.g. SaOS-2, human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblast-like cells) have revealed that CaP coatings enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation and differentiation to promote bone regeneration. However, in vivo, the exact mechanism of osteogenesis in response to CaP coatings is unclear; indeed, there are conflicting reports of the effectiveness of CaP coatings, with results ranging from highly effective to no significant or even negative effects. This review therefore highlights progress in CaP coatings for orthopaedic implants and discusses the future research and use of these devices. Currently, an exciting area of research is in bioactive hybrid composite CaP-based coatings containing both inorganic (CaP coating) and organic (collagen, bone morphogenetic proteins, arginylglycylaspartic acid etc.) components with the aim of promoting tissue ingrowth and vascularization. Further investigations are necessary to reveal the relative influences of implant design, surgical procedure, and coating characteristics (thickness, structure, topography, porosity, wettability etc.) on the long-term clinical effects of hybrid CaP coatings. In addition to commercially available plasma spraying, other effective routes for the fabrication of hybrid CaP coatings for clinical use still need to be determined and current progress is discussed.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["Roman ASurmenev", "Maria ASurmeneva", "Anna AIvanova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.036"}

Porous constructs have been successful in allowing for vessel infiltration without requiring extensive matrix degradation. We hypothesized that the rate and maturity of infiltrating vessels could be enhanced by complementing the open pore structure with the added delivery of DNA encoding for angiogenic growth factors. Both 100 and 60 \u03bcm porous and non-porous hyaluronic acid hydrogels loaded with pro-angiogenic (pVEGF) or reporter (pGFPluc) plasmid nanoparticles were used to study the effects of pore size and DNA delivery on angiogenesis in a mouse subcutaneous implant model. GFP-expressing transfected cells were found inside all control hydrogels over the course of the study, although transfection levels peaked by week 3 for 100 and 60 \u03bcm porous hydrogels. Transfection in non-porous hydrogels continued to increase over time corresponding with continued surface degradation. pVEGF transfection levels were not high enough to enhance angiogenesis by increasing vessel density, maturity, or size, although by 6 weeks for all pore size hydrogels more hydrogel implants were positive for vascularization when pVEGF polyplexes were incorporated compared to control hydrogels. Pore size was found to be the dominant factor in determining the angiogenic response with 60 \u03bcm porous hydrogels having more vessels/area present than 100 \u03bcm porous hydrogels at the initial onset of angiogenesis at 3 weeks.

The aim of this study was to show the effectiveness of liposomes as an ultrasound contrast agent to describe the 3-D vascular architecture of a tumor. Eight C57BL/6 mice grafted with syngeneic B16-F10 murine melanoma cells were injected with a bolus of 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (DSPC)-based non-targeted liposomes and with a bolus of microbubbles. 3-D contrast-enhanced images of the tumor lesions were acquired in three conditions: pre-contrast, after the injection of microbubbles, and after the injection of liposomes. By using a previously developed reconstruction and characterization image processing technique, we obtained the 3-D representation of the vascular architecture in these three conditions. Six descriptive parameters of these networks were also computed: the number of vascular trees (NT), the vascular density (VD), the number of branches, the 2-D curvature measure, the number of vascular flexes of the vessels, and the 3-D curvature. Results showed that all the vascular descriptors obtained by liposome-based images were statistically equal to those obtained by using microbubbles, except the VD which was found to be lower for liposome images. All the six descriptors computed in pre-contrast conditions had values that were statistically lower than those computed in presence of contrast, both for liposomes and microbubbles.

To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine and/or CKD-516, H460 xenograft mice were treated with CKD-516 (2.5 mg/kg) and/or gemcitabine (40 mg/kg), and tumor growth was compared with vehicle-treated control.

S516 disrupted tubulin assembly and resulted in microtubule dysfunction, which induced cell cycle arrest (G2/M). S516 markedly enhanced the depolymerization of microtubules, perhaps due to the vascular disrupting properties of S516. Interestingly, S516 decreased the amount of total tubulin protein in HUVECs.

It is well established that cross talk between endodermal and mesenchymal components of the foregut occurs, particularly regarding the vascularization of developing organs. Furthermore, genetic mutations in mesenchymal and hepatic compartments of the developing foregut result in similar foregut pathologies: hypoplastic liver, absence of GB, biliary atresia (intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic), and failure of gut elongation and rotation.

Clinical outcomes in terms of knee stability, clinical scores, vascularization, proprioception, tibial tunnel enlargement and complications were qualitatively compared.\nThirteen studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Compared with the standard procedure, significantly better results regarding knee stability in the remnant preserving group were reported in two of nine studies in the instrumented knee laxity, one of eight studies in the Lachman test and none of eight studies regarding the pivot shift test. Five studies assessed International Knee Documentation Committee scores but found no differences. One of two studies indicated significantly earlier revascularization according to the signal/noise quotient value of the graft on magnetic resonance imaging. One of two studies indicated significantly better proprioceptive function in terms of joint position sense using the reproduction of passive positioning test. Two of two studies showed significantly less tibial tunnel enlargement in the remnant preserving group. None of the studies showed significant increase in the risk of cyclops lesion formation and the loss of knee range of motion in the remnant augmentation group.\nThe current evidence suggests that the short-term clinical outcomes of patients with the remnant augmentation technique are comparable, if not superior, with that of patients undergoing the standard technique, although it is insufficient to justify the remnant preserving augmentation as a routine treatment for anterior cruciate ligament ruptures.\nSystematic review, Level IV.", "journal": "Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA", "date": "2013-11-05", "authors": ["JianzhongHu", "JinQu", "DaqiXu", "TaoZhang", "JingyongZhou", "HongbinLu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00167-013-2749-8"}

But little is known about the optimal pore size and level of cross-linking. Different formulations of dermal substitutes with unidirectional pores were tested in porcine full-thickness wounds in combination with autologous split skin mesh grafts (SSG). Effect on wound healing was evaluated both macro- and microscopically. CE scaffolds with a pore size of 80 or 100\u00a0\u03bcm resulted in good wound healing after one-stage grafting. Application of scaffolds with a larger average pore size (120\u00a0\u03bcm) resulted in more myofibroblasts and more foreign body giant cells (FBGC). Moderate crosslinking impaired wound healing as it resulted in more wound contraction, more FBGC and increased epidermal thickness compared to no cross-linking. In addition, take rate and redness were negatively affected compared to SSG only. Vascularization and the number of myofibroblasts were not affected by cross-linking. Surprisingly, stability of cross-linked scaffolds was not increased in the wound environment, in contrast to in vitro results. Cross-linking reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro, which might explain the reduced clinical outcome. The non-cross-linked CE substitute with unidirectional pores allowed one-stage grafting of SSG, resulting in good wound healing. In addition, only a very mild foreign body reaction was observed. Cross-linking of CE scaffolds negatively affected wound healing on several important parameters. The optimal non-cross-linked CE substitute is a promising candidate for future clinical evaluation.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

{"title": "Heparin modification of a biomimetic bone matrix for controlled release of VEGF.", "abstract": "Bone regeneration using tissue engineered constructs requires strategies to effectively stimulate vascularization within such a construct that is crucial for its supply and integration with the host tissue. In this work, porous scaffolds of a collagen/hydroxyapatite nanocomposite were modified with heparin to generate biomimetic bone matrices which are able to release angiogenic factors in a controlled manner. Heparin was either integrated during material synthesis (in situ) or added to the scaffolds after their fabrication (post). Both approaches resulted in stable incorporation of heparin into the matrix of mineralized collagen. Investigations of binding and release of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A\u2081\u2086\u2085) loaded onto the scaffolds revealed an enhanced binding capacity as well as a sustained and nearly constant delivery of VEGF as result of both heparin modification methods. The release rate could be controlled by varying the quantity of incorporated heparin and the modification method. Although the biological activity of VEGF released after 7 days from the unmodified scaffolds was reduced in comparison to control VEGF, it was maintained after release from post or even enhanced after release from in situ modified scaffolds. In conclusion, the heparin-modified scaffolds of mineralized collagen exhibited favorable growth factor binding and release properties and may be beneficial to stimulate vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Here we present a completely novel role for the helix-loop-helix transcription factor Early B-cell factor 1 (Ebf1), originally identified for B-cell maturation, for the proper maturation of glomerular cells from mesenchymal progenitors. The expression of Ebf1 was both spatially and temporally regulated within the developing cortex and glomeruli. Using Ebf1-null mice, we then identified biochemical, metabolic, and histological abnormalities in renal development that arose in the absence of this transcription factor. In the Ebf1 knockout mice, the developed kidneys show thinned cortices and reduced glomerular maturation. The glomeruli showed abnormal vascularization and severely effaced podocytes. The mice exhibited early albuminuria and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, the glomerular filtration rate was reduced >66% and the expression of podocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A was decreased compared with wild-type control mice. Thus, Ebf1 has a significant and novel role in glomerular development, podocyte maturation, and the maintenance of kidney integrity and function.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2013-11-01", "authors": ["Jackie AFretz", "TracyNelson", "HeinoVelazquez", "YougenXi", "Gilbert WMoeckel", "Mark CHorowitz"], "doi": "10.1038/ki.2013.433"}
{"title": "Considerations in the surgical use of the flexor sheath and pulley system.", "abstract": "The use of the digital flexor sheath to reconstruct damaged structures in the fingers is an intriguing but under-investigated subject. The sheath is anchored firmly to the phalanges and palmar plates and has well-vascularized outer and synovial inner layers. The middle layer is strong and fibrous and not all of it is required for its main biomechanical function of maintaining the moment arm of the flexor tendons. These characteristics have led to several descriptions of different reconstructive uses. In sheath reconstruction, flaps can be used to repair damaged A2 and A4 pulleys. As an anchor, the sheath is useful for tenodeses and tendon transfers. It has been used in the correction of ulnar claw and swan neck deformities. In ligament reconstruction, the A1 pulley has been used to reconstruct the transverse intermetacarpal ligament in cleft hand and ray amputations. The sheath has also been used to cover tendon repairs and periosteal defects with the aim of decreasing adhesions. There is potential for further use of the flexor sheath in reconstructive surgery. The digital flexor sheath can be used to restore various finger functions providing its physiological roles are recognized and preserved.

Extensively studied for its capacity to promote cancer progression, heparanase enzyme was recently implicated as an important determinant in several inflammatory disorders as well. Applying immunohistochemical staining, we detected preferential expression of heparanase by epidermal keratinocytes in human psoriatic lesions. To investigate the role of the enzyme in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we utilized heparanase transgenic mice in a model of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced cutaneous inflammation. We report that over-expression of the enzyme promotes development of mouse skin lesions that strongly recapitulate the human disease in terms of histomorphological appearance and molecular/cellular characteristics. Importantly, heparanase of epidermal origin appears to facilitate abnormal activation of skin-infiltrating macrophages, thus generating psoriasis-like inflammation conditions, characterized by induction of STAT3, enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling, elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and increased vascularization. Taken together, our results reveal, for the first time, involvement of heparanase in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and highlight a role for the enzyme in facilitating abnormal interactions between immune and epithelial cell subsets of the affected skin.

Within the present work, we demonstrate a novel standardized, time-efficient, and reproducible protocol for the decellularization of solid tissues to derive a ready to use biomatrix within only 5 h. Furthermore, we prove that biomatrices are usable as potential scaffolds for tissue engineering of vascularized tissues, even beyond tissue and maybe even species barriers. To prove this, we seeded human primary osteoblasts into a rat kidney bioscaffold. Here, seeded cells spread homogeneously within the matrix and proliferate under dynamic culture conditions. The cells do not only maintain their original phenotype within the matrix, they also show a strong metabolic activity and remodel the biomatrix toward a bone-like extracellular matrix.

Myocardial miRNAs modulate processes such as cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy, excitation-contraction coupling, and apoptosis; non-CM-specific miRNAs regulate myocardial vascularization and fibrosis. Recently, the possibility that circulating miRNAs may be biomarkers of cardiovascular disease has been raised.\nForty-one HCM patients were characterized with conventional transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance.

Two murine models of respectively 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-Acetate (TPA)-induced dermatitis and mechanical skin lesion were used here to assess the efficacy of d-Limonene or POH applied topically. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of skin lesions was performed as well as that of P-selectin expression, together with measurements of serum concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the first model. Healing and angiogenesis around the scar were examined in the second model. Because differences in angiogenesis were noted, the effect of both d-Limonene and POH was further tested on an in vitro model of endothelial microtubules formation. Both d-Limonene and POH reduced the severity and extension of TPA-induced skin lesions with significantly lowered macroscopic and microscopic scores (p<0.04 in both cases). Moreover, the expression of P-selectin induced by TPA was abrogated by POH and significantly lower serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were observed in d-Limonene- and POH-treated mice (p<0.04 and 0.03). In the second model, tissue regeneration was improved, especially by POH, and was clearly associated with reduced neovascularization. This surprising anti-angiogenic effect was confirmed in the matrigel model of endothelial microtubules formation. These studies show that d-Limonene and POH demonstrate significant anti-inflammatory effects in murine dermal inflammation and wound-healing.

To achieve this goal, we developed a multiculture microfluidic platform enabling precise control over paracrine signaling, cell-seeding densities, and hydrogel mechanical properties. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded in fibrin gels and cultured alongside human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). The engineered vessels formed in our device contained patent, perfusable lumens.

The number of branches, average branch length, percent vascularized area, and average vessel diameter were found to depend uniquely on several input parameters. Importantly, multiple inputs were found to control any given output network parameter. For example, the vessel diameter can be decreased either by applying angiogenic growth factors--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and sphingosine-1-phsophate (S1P)--or by increasing the fibrinogen concentration in the hydrogel.

We transduced the ECs that coat the modules with a lentiviral construct to overexpress the angiogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1). Upon injection of modules in a subcutaneous SCID/Bg mouse model, there was an increase in the number of blood vessels for implants with ECs transduced to overexpress Del-1 compared with control implants (with enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP]-transduced ECs) over the 21-day duration of the study. The greatest difference between Del-1 and eGFP implants and the highest number of blood vessels were observed 7 days after transplantation. The day-7 Del-1 implants also had increased SMA+ staining compared with control, suggesting increased blood vessel maturation through recruitment of SMA+ smooth muscle cells or pericytes to stabilize the newly formed blood vessels. Perfusion studies (microcomputed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and systemic injection of fluorescent UEA-1 or dextran) showed that some of the newly formed blood vessels (both donor derived and host derived, in both Del-1 and eGFP implants) were perfused and connected to the host vasculature as early as 7 days after transplantation, and at later time points as well.

Although chemical crosslinking has been used to stiffen collagen and protect it against enzymatic degradation in vivo, it remains unclear how crosslinking alters the vascularization of collagen hydrogels. In this study, we examine how the crosslinking agents genipin and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide alter vascular stability and function in microfluidic type I collagen gels in vitro. Under moderate perfusion (\u223c10 dyn/cm(2) shear stress), tubes of blood endothelial cells (ECs) exhibited indistinguishable stability and barrier function in untreated and crosslinked scaffolds. Surprisingly, under low perfusion (\u223c5 dyn/cm(2) shear stress) or nearly zero transmural pressure, microvessels in crosslinked scaffolds remained stable, while those in untreated gels rapidly delaminated and became poorly perfused. Similarly, tubes of lymphatic ECs under intermittent flow were more stable in crosslinked gels than in untreated ones. These effects correlated well with the degree of mechanical stiffening, as predicted by analysis of fracture energies at the cell-scaffold interface. This work demonstrates that crosslinking of collagen scaffolds does not hinder normal EC physiology; instead, crosslinked scaffolds promote vascular stability.

Genetically modified pigs were characterized at the molecular, cellular, histological, and physiological levels.\nA 7.6-kb fragment containing the entire upstream region of the porcine THBD gene was found to drive a high expression in a porcine endothelial cell line and was therefore used to control hTM expression in transgenic pigs. The abundance of hTM was restricted to the endothelium, according to the predicted pattern, and the transgene expression of hTM was stably inherited to the offspring. When endothelial cells from pigs carrying the hTM transgene--either alone or in combination with an aGalTKO and a transgene encoding the human CD46-were tested in a coagulation assay with human whole blood, the clotting time was increased three- to four-fold (P<0.001) compared to wild-type and aGalTKO/CD46 transgenic endothelial cells. This, for the first time, demonstrated the anticoagulant properties of hTM on porcine endothelial cells in a human whole blood assay.\nThe biological efficacy of hTM suggests that the (multi-)transgenic donor pigs described here have the potential to overcome coagulation incompatibilities in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2013-10-24", "authors": ["AnnegretWuensch", "AndreaBaehr", "Anjan KBongoni", "ElisabethKemter", "AndreasBlutke", "WiebkeBaars", "SonjaHaertle", "ValeriZakhartchenko", "MayukoKurome", "BarbaraKessler", "ClaudiusFaber", "Jan-MichaelAbicht", "BrunoReichart", "RuedigerWanke", "ReinhardSchwinzer", "HiroshiNagashima", "RobertRieben", "DavidAyares", "EckhardWolf", "NikolaiKlymiuk"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e3182a95cbc"}

The immediate result of these operations is often good, but the long-term result is unfortunately unpredictable. The authors used an experimental model to evaluate the vascularization, survival, and metabolic changes after free fat transfer and the impact of proangiogenic therapy on these processes.\nFat was collected from the mouse epididymal region and placed into the subcutaneous tissue of the forehead. Fat grafts were treated with proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (n = 9) or the control vector (n = 9). Metabolic activity and fat graft volume were investigated by positron emission tomography-computed tomography at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks. Histologic analysis was performed at 12 weeks.\nThe glucose metabolism (fluorodeoxyglucose uptake) of the transferred epididymal fat was higher than in the epididymal fat before transplantation in both study groups (VEGF-A and control) and resembled that of normal subcutaneous fat. VEGF-A therapy enhanced the survival and capillary density of the transferred fat after surgery.\nTransfer of the metabolically inactive (epididymal) fat into a new environment modulated the metabolic activity of the fat grafts to resemble the situation in the recipient site. These novel findings support the clinical use of free fat grafts in various anatomical regions and tissue types.

To meet this goal, 2-N,6-O-sulfated chitosan (26SCS) based nanoparticle (S-NP) was successfully developed and showed a dose-dependent enhancement on angiogenesis in vitro. For the repair of a critical sized defect in rabbit radius, we developed BMP-2 loaded S-NP (BMP-2/S-NP) with protein loading efficiency of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2% and fabricated a gelatin sponge (G) based implant loaded with BMP-2/S-NP (BMP-2/S-NP/G). This implant exerted a delivery of BMP-2 with an initial burst release of 15.3 \u00b1 4.1% in first 24 h and a gradual release for 21 days to 77.8 \u00b1 3.6%. The in vitro ALP assay revealed that the activity of released BMP-2 from BMP-2/S-NP/G was maintained after 3-d and 7-d delivery and further enhanced after 14-d delivery compared with the original BMP-2. Furthermore, the in vivo effects of BMP-2/S-NP/G on the bone regeneration and vessel formation in the critical sized defect (18 mm) of rabbit radius were investigated by synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR\u03bcCT) imaging, three dimensional micro-computed tomographic (\u03bcCT) imaging, histological analysis, immunohistochemistry and biomechanical measurement. Based on the results, both peripheral vessel and new vessel formation were significantly increased by the BMP-2/S-NP/G treatment, along with the bridged defects at as early as 2 weeks, the healed defects at 8 weeks and the reunion of bone marrow cavity at 12 weeks. The results indicated that both controlled release of active BMP-2 and favorable vascularization at the defect site contributed by BMP-2/S-NP/G played a crucial role in accelerating and promoting bone augmentation.

{"title": "Using Del-1 to tip the angiogenic balance in endothelial cells in modular constructs.", "abstract": "Modular tissue engineering is a method of building vascularized tissue-engineered constructs. Submillimeter-sized collagen pieces (modules) coated with a layer of endothelial cells (EC; vascular component), and with embedded functional cells, are self-assembled into a larger, three-dimensional tissue. In this study, we examined the use of developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), an extracellular matrix protein with proangiogenic properties, as a means of tipping the angiogenic balance in human umbilical vein endothelial cells incorporated in modular tissue-engineered constructs. The motivation was to enhance the vascularization of these constructs upon transplantation in vivo, in this case, without the use of exogenous mesenchymal stromal cells. EC were transduced using a lentiviral construct to overexpress Del-1. The Del-1 EC formed more sprouts in a fibrin gel sprouting assay in vitro compared with eGFP (control) transduced EC, as expected. Del-1 EC had a distinct profile of gene expression (upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9], urokinase-type plasminogen activator [uPA/PLAU], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF-A], and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]; downregulation of angiopoietin-2 [Ang2]), also supporting the notion of \"tipping the angiogenic balance\". On the other hand, contrary to our expectations, when Del-1 EC-coated modules were implanted subcutaneously in a severe combined immunodeficient/beige animal model, the proangiogenic effect of Del-1 was less remarkable. There was only a small increase in the number of blood vessels formed in Del-1 implants compared with the eGFP implants, and only few blood vessels formed at the implant site in both cases. This was presumed due to limited EC survival after transplantation. We speculate that if we could improve EC survival in our study (for example, by adding other prosurvival factors or supporting cells), we would see a greater Del-1-induced angiogenic benefit in vivo as a consequence of increased Del-1 secretion by a higher number of surviving cells.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Fluid shear stress pre-conditioning promotes endothelial morphogenesis of embryonic stem cells within embryoid bodies.", "abstract": "Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are capable of differentiating into all mesoderm-derived cell lineages, including endothelial, hematopoietic, and cardiac cell types. Common strategies to direct mesoderm differentiation of ESCs rely on exposing the cells to a series of biochemical and biophysical cues at different stages of differentiation to promote maturation toward specific cell phenotypes. Shear forces that mimic cardiovascular physiological forces can evoke a myriad of responses in somatic and stem cell populations, and have, thus, been studied as a means to direct stem cell differentiation. However, elucidating the effects of shear pre-conditioning on the subsequent vascular differentiation and morphogenesis of ESCs has yet to be examined. In this study, ESC monolayers were subjected to physiological shear (5\u2009dyn/cm(2)) or static conditions for 2 days on collagen IV-coated substrates before initiating embryoid body (EB) differentiation. Immediately after the pre-conditioning period, shear pre-conditioned and statically cultured ESCs exhibited similar morphologies and largely retained a pluripotent phenotype; however, ESCs exposed to fluid shear expressed increased levels of endothelial marker genes Flk-1 (\u223c3-fold), VE-cadherin (\u223c3-fold), and PECAM (\u223c2-fold), compared with statically cultured ESCs. After 7 days of EB culture, \u223c70% of EBs formed from shear pre-conditioned ESCs expressed significantly higher levels of endothelial marker genes compared with EBs formed from statically cultured ESCs. Interestingly, unlike EBs formed from statically cultured ESCs, EBs formed from fluid shear stress pre-conditioned ESCs exhibited a centrally localized region of VE-cadherin(+) cells that persisted for at least 10 days of differentiation. These results demonstrate that fluid shear stress pre-conditioning not only promotes ESC endothelial gene expression but also subsequently impacts the organization of endothelial cells within EBs. Together, these studies highlight a novel approach to promote in vitro morphogenesis of developmental vasculogenic models and potentially promote pre-vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs derived from pluripotent stem cells.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a platelet-derived growth factor with pleiotropic effects on many cell types. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exhibit unique secretory and stimulatory characteristics depending on their differentiation state. In light of the potential of MSC in cell-based therapies, we examined the ability of LPA to abrogate SD/H-induced apoptosis in human MSC at increasing stages of osteogenic differentiation in vitro and assessed MSC survival in vivo. Undifferentiated MSC were rescued from SD/H-induced apoptosis by treatment with both 25 and 100 \u03bcM LPA. However, MSC conditioned with osteogenic supplements responded to 25 \u03bcM LPA, and cells conditioned with dexamethasone-containing osteogenic media required 100 \u03bcM LPA. This rescue was mediated through LPA1 in all cases. The addition of 25 \u03bcM LPA enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by MSC in all conditions, but VEGF availability was not responsible for protection against apoptosis. We also showed that codelivery of 25 \u03bcM LPA with MSC in alginate hydrogels significantly improved the persistence of undifferentiated MSC in vivo over 4 weeks as measured by bioluminescence imaging. Osteogenic differentiation alone was protective of SD/H-induced apoptosis in vitro, and the synergistic delivery of LPA did not enhance persistence of osteogenically induced MSC in vivo. These data demonstrate that the capacity of LPA to inhibit SD/H-induced apoptosis in MSC is dependent on both the differentiation state and dosage. This information will be valuable for optimizing osteogenic conditioning regimens for MSC before in vivo implementation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Past studies had shown that Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant genes lead to overactivation of mTOR in the regulating pathways in developing fetus. We used conditional Cre-loxp gene knockout approach to delete Tsc1 in mice's endothelial cells in our experimental models. Similarly, activation of mTOR signaling in endothelial cells of these embryos (Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-)) was found. Majority of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos died at embryonic day 14.5 in utero. Cardiovascular defects, subcutaneous edema and hemorrhage were present among them. Whole-mount immunostaining in these embryos revealed a disorganized vascular network, defective sprouting of vessels in yolk sac and thickening of the labyrinth layer in the placenta. A thinner ventricular wall with disorganized trabeculae was present in the hearts of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos. Endothelial cells in Tsc1-deficient mice showed defective mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticular morphology, but no significant change was observed in cell junctions. The mutant embryos displayed significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and disturbed expression of angiogenic factors. A cohort of mice was treated prenatally with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The offspring of these mutant mice survived up to 22 days after birth.

{"title": "Proangiogenic microtemplated fibrin scaffolds containing aprotinin promote improved wound healing responses.", "abstract": "Survival of tissue engineered constructs after implantation depends heavily on induction of a vascular response in host tissue, promoting a quick anastomosis of the cellular graft. Additionally, implanted constructs typically induce fibrous capsule formation, effectively preventing graft integration with host tissue. Previously we described the development of a high density microtemplated fibrin scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering applications with tunable degradation and mechanical properties which promoted seeded cell survival and organization in vitro (Thomson et al., Tissue Eng Part A, 2013). Scaffold degradation in vitro was controllable by addition of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and/or the fibrin cross-linker Factor XIII (FXIII). The goal of this study was to assess host tissue responses to these fibrin scaffold formulations by determining effects on scaffold degradation, angiogenic responses, and fibrous capsule formation in a subcutaneous implant model. Aprotinin significantly decreased scaffold degradation over 2\u00a0weeks of implantation. A significant increase in capillary infiltration of aprotinin implants was found after 1 and 2\u00a0weeks, with a significantly greater amount of capillaries reaching the interior of aprotinin scaffolds. Interestingly, after 2\u00a0weeks the aprotinin scaffolds had a significantly thinner, yet apparently more cellular fibrous capsule than unmodified scaffolds. These results indicate aprotinin not only inhibits fibrin scaffold degradation, but also induces significant responses in the host tissue. These included an angiogenic response resulting in increased vascularization of the scaffold material over a relatively short period of time.

As the absence of tissue vascularization limits the ability to stimulate new tissue growth, relatively few surgical approaches are currently available (alloplastic implants or sculpted autologous cartilage grafts) to repair or reconstruct the auricle (or pinna) as a result of traumatic loss or congenital absence (e.g., microtia). Alternatively, tissue engineering can offer the potential to grow autogenous cartilage suitable for implantation. While tissue-engineered auricle cartilage constructs can be created, a substantial number of cells are required to generate sufficient quantities of tissue for reconstruction. Similarly, as routine cell expansion can elicit negative effects on chondrocyte function, we have developed an approach to generate large-sized engineered auricle constructs (\u22653\u2009cm(2)) directly from a small population of donor cells (20,000-40,000 cells/construct). Using rabbit donor cells, the developed bioreactor-cultivated constructs adopted structural-like characteristics similar to native auricular cartilage, including the development of distinct cartilaginous and perichondrium-like regions.

The transplantation of iPSc also significantly decreased the low-/high-frequency ratio and arrhythmia score of programmed electric stimulation-induced VA. In conclusion, iPSc intramyocardial transplantation reduces vulnerability to VAs, and the mechanism was related to the remodeling amelioration of autonomic nerves and gap junctions. Moreover, possible mechanisms of iPSc transplantation in improving neural remodeling may be related to attenuated oxidative stress and inflammatory response.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["FengxiangZhang", "GuixianSong", "XiaorongLi", "WeijuanGu", "YahuiShen", "MinglongChen", "BingYang", "LingmeiQian", "KejiangCao"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.24687"}

Definitive treatment frequently requires well vascularized tissue harvested from the chest. To limit tracheostoma obstruction, a thin and pliable flap is preferable. The internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) island flap fulfills these criteria, but it is not well known and is not commonly used by head and neck surgeons. In this article, based on our experience, we describe our surgical technique and the strengths and weaknesses of this flap.\nRetrospective cohort study and systematic review of the literature.\nAn IMAP flap was performed on 12 patients to repair postoperative fistulas, located in the lower neck close to the tracheal stoma or involving the posterior tracheal wall, from March 2009 to December 2012. The medical records of each of patient were retrospectively analyzed.\nA breach of the pleura occurred in one patient. It was diagnosed and treated perioperatively. One patient had a total flap necrosis and required a reoperation. The postoperative course was uneventful in 11 patients (92%). All donor sites were closed primarily without any wound-healing problems.\nThe IMAP flap is reliable. Its advantages make it a convenient flap to repair peritracheostomal defects and fistulas.

Of 55 US-guided injections, 48 (87.3%) were successful and 7 (12.7%) were missed. The FL-guided SIJ approach exhibited a greater accuracy (98.2%) than the US-guided approach. Vascularization around the SIJ was seen in 34 of 55 patients. Among the 34 patients, 7 had vascularization inside the joint, 23 had vascularization around the joint, and 4 had vascularization both inside and around the joint. Three cases of intravascular injections occurred in the FL group.\nThe US-guided approach may facilitate the identification and avoidance of the critical vessels around or within the SIJ. Function and pain relief significantly improved in both groups without significant differences between groups.

{"title": "Calcitriol reduces thrombospondin-1 and increases vascular endothelial growth factor in breast cancer cells: implications for tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Calcitriol, a potent antineoplastic vitamin D metabolite, inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and slows the growth of tumors. Calcitriol also may exert either antiangiogenic or proangiogenic effects depending on the tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1) are key factors involved in promoting and inhibiting angiogenesis, respectively. The effects of calcitriol on Tsp-1 have not been studied in the mammary gland, while VEGF regulation is not clear, since opposite outcomes have been demonstrated. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of calcitriol on VEGF and Tsp-1 expression in primary breast tumor-derived cells and a panel of established breast cancer cell lines. In vivo studies in athymic mice were also performed in order to gain further insight into the biological effects of calcitriol on angiogenesis. Real time-PCR and ELISA analyses showed that calcitriol stimulated VEGF mRNA expression and protein secretion while elicited the opposite effect on Tsp-1 in 7 out of 8 cell lines studied, independently of the cell phenotype (P<0.05 in n=5). In vivo, calcitriol significantly inhibited the relative tumoral volume after 4 weeks of treatment; however, serum VEGF was higher in calcitriol-treated animals compared to controls (P<0.05). The integrated fluorescence intensity analysis of CD31, a vessel marker, showed that xenografted breast cancer cells developed tumors with similar vascular density regardless of the treatment. Nevertheless, larger necrotic areas were observed in the tumors of calcitriol-treated mice compared to controls. Since the antineoplastic activity of calcitriol has been consistently demonstrated in several studies including this one, our results suggest that the antitumoral effect of calcitriol in vivo involve different mechanisms not necessarily related to the inhibition of tumor vascularization. Overall, our findings indicate that calcitriol can impact the angiogenic process in breast cancer by regulating VEGF and Tsp-1 expression.

The porous hydrogels generated from chemical sintering possessed pore uniformity and interconnectivity comparable to the commonly used non- and heat sintering techniques. Moreover, a similar cell response to the porous hydrogels generated from each sintering approach was observed in cell viability, spreading and proliferation in vitro, as well as cellular invasion in vivo.

We characterized the immunomodulatory properties of syngeneic (derived from the recipient strain) adipocyte-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and investigated their potential to induce VCA tolerance in rats.\nADSCs were isolated from Lewis (LEW, RT1A(l)) rats; their immunomodulatory properties were evaluated by means of mixed lymphocyte reactions in vitro and VCAs in vivo across a full major histocompatibility complex mismatch with the use of Brown-Norway (BN, RT1A(n)) donor rats. Two control and four experimental groups were designed to evaluate treatment effects of ADSCs and transient immunosuppressants (anti-lymphocyte globulin, cyclosporine) with or without low-dose (200 cGy) total body irradiation. Flow cytometry was performed to quantify levels of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs).\nCultured syngeneic ADSCs exhibited CD90.1(+)CD29(+)CD73(+)CD45(-)CD79a(-)CD11b/c(-) phenotype and the plasticity to differentiate to adipocytes and osteocytes. ADSCs dramatically suppressed proliferation of LEW splenocytes against BN antigen and mitogen, respectively, in a dose-dependent fashion, culminating in abrogation of allo- and mitogen-stimulated proliferation at the highest concentration tested. Accordingly, one infusion of syngeneic ADSCs markedly prolonged VCA survival in LEW recipients treated with transient immunosuppression; of these, 66% developed tolerance. Total body irradiation provided no additional VCA survival benefit. An important role for Tregs in tolerance induction/maintenance was suggested in vivo and in vitro.\nTreatment comprising syngeneic ADSCs and transient immunosuppression (i) increased levels of circulating Tregs and (ii) induced tolerance in 66% of recipients of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched VCAs.", "journal": "Cytotherapy", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["Hui-YunCheng", "NicolaeGhetu", "Wei-ChaoHuang", "Yen-LingWang", "Christopher GlennWallace", "Chih-JenWen", "Hung-ChangChen", "Ling-YiShih", "Chih-FanLin", "Shiaw-MinHwang", "Shuen-KueiLiao", "Fu-ChanWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.06.020"}

A 16-year-old white male was referred to the Ophthalmology Clinic due to deterioration of vision in his left eye. Medical history was significant for dyskeratosis congenita associated with thrombocytopenia. General physical examination revealed reticular pigmentation on the upper half of the chest, vertical ridges and splitting of finger nails, and oral mucosal leukoplakia. Ophthalmological examination of the anterior segment was unremarkable. Retinal examination revealed vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye veiling the retinal details. A possible history of trauma was denied. Fundus examination of the right eye showed retinal vascular sheathing with a few dot and blot retinal hemorrhages. Fluorescein angiography revealed extensive areas of non-perfusion beyond the equator in the right eye, later treated with scatter laser photocoagulation. We performed a 23-gauge vitrectomy with endolaser treatment of the new vascularization areas in the left eye. After 6 months, best-corrected visual acuity in the right and left eye was 20/20 and 20/25, respectively. Rather than being confined to anterior segment abnormalities like conjunctivitis, blepharitis and nasolacrimal duct obstruction which are reported in the literature, dyskeratosis congenita can cause significant visual loss due to retinal vasculitis and vitreous hemorrhage.

{"title": "Generation of bioartificial heart tissue by combining a three-dimensional gel-based cardiac construct with decellularized small intestinal submucosa.", "abstract": "The in vitro generation of a bioartificial cardiac construct (CC) represents a promising tool for the repair of ischemic heart tissue. Several approaches to engineer cardiac tissue in vitro have been conducted. The main drawback of these studies is the insufficient size of the resulting construct for clinical applications. The focus of this study was the generation of an artificial three-dimensional (3D), contractile, and suturable myocardial patch by combining a gel-based CC with decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), thereby engineering an artificial tissue of 11\u2009cm\u00b2 in size. The alignment and morphology of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs) in SIS-CC complexes were investigated as well as the re-organization of primary endothelial cells which were co-isolated in the rCM preparation. The ability of a rat heart endothelial cell line (RHE-A) to re-cellularize pre-existing vessel structures within the SIS or a biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) was determined. SIS-CC contracted spontaneously, uniformly, and rhythmically with an average rate of 200 beats/min in contrast to undirected contractions observed in CC without SIS support. rCM exhibited an elongated morphology with well-defined sarcomeric structures oriented along the longitudinal axis in the SIS-CC, whereas round-shaped and random-arranged rCM were observed in CC. Electric coupling of rCM was demonstrated by microelectrode array measurements. A dense network of CD31\u207a/eNOS\u207a cells was detected as permeating the whole construct. Superficial supplementation of RHE-A cells to SIS-CC led to the migration of these cells through the CC, resulting in the re-population of pre-existing vessel structures within the decelluarized SIS. By infusion of RHE-A cells into the BioVaM venous and arterial pedicles, a re-population of the BioVaM vessel bed as well as distribution of RHE-A cells throughout the CC was achieved. Rat endothelial cells within the CC were in contact with RHE-A cells. Ingrowth and formation of a network by endothelial cells infused through the BioVaM represent a promising step toward engineering a functional perfusion system, enabling the engineering of vascularized and well-nourished 3D CC of dimensions relevant for therapeutic heart repair.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Seamless vascularized large-diameter tubular collagen scaffolds reinforced with polymer knittings for esophageal regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "A clinical demand exists for alternatives to repair the esophagus in case of congenital defects, cancer, or trauma. A seamless biocompatible off-the-shelf large-diameter tubular scaffold, which is accessible for vascularization, could set the stage for regenerative medicine of the esophagus. The use of seamless scaffolds eliminates the error-prone tubularization step, which is necessary when emanating from flat scaffolds. In this study, we developed and characterized three different types of seamless tubular scaffolds, and evaluated in vivo tissue compatibility, including vascularization by omental wrapping. Scaffolds (luminal \u00d8 \u223c 1.5 cm) were constructed using freezing, lyophilizing, and cross-linking techniques and included (1) single-layered porous collagen scaffold, (2) dual-layered (porous+dense) collagen scaffold, and (3) hybrid scaffold (collagen+incorporated polycaprolacton knitting). The latter had an ultimate tensile strength comparable to a porcine esophagus. To induce rapid vascularization, scaffolds were implanted in the omentum of sheep using a wrapping technique. After 6 weeks of biocompatibility, vascularization, calcification, and hypoxia were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Scaffolds were biocompatible, and cellular influx and ingrowth of blood vessels were observed throughout the whole scaffold. No calcification was observed, and slight hypoxic conditions were detected only in the direct vicinity of the polymer knitting. It is concluded that seamless large-diameter tubular collagen-based scaffolds can be constructed and vascularized in vivo.

In adipose tissue reduced blood vessel density is related to hypoxia state, cell death and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that adipocytes of poorly vascularized enlarged visceral adipose tissue (i.e. adipose tissue of old mice) suffer from limited nutrient delivery. In particular, nutrient starvation elicits increased activity of mitochondrial proline oxidase/dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH) that is causal in triggering a ROS-dependent induction of ATGL. We demonstrate that ATGL promotes the expression of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1), thus setting a metabolic switch towards fat utilization that supplies energy to starved adipocytes and prevents cell death, as well as adipose tissue inflammation.

{"title": "Diet-induced obesity may affect the uterine immune environment in early-mid pregnancy, reducing NK-cell activity and potentially compromising uterine vascularization.", "abstract": "To investigate the effect of obesity in early-mid pregnancy on crucial pregnancy hormones and the uterine immune environment.\nObesity impacts reproductive ability, adversely affecting conception and leading to complications in pregnancy. Obesity is often regarded as a stress state and an immune disease, both of which may contribute to pregnancy failure. We previously demonstrated that stress in early pregnancy greatly alters progesterone secretion. As progesterone is an immunomodulator, altered progesterone secretion may adversely modify the maternal immune system. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that obesity during pregnancy adversely alters the uterine immune environment.\nAn obese mouse model was created by feeding C57/BL6 mice on a high-fat (HF)/sugar diet for 12 weeks before pregnancy. Control mice were fed on lower-fat/sugar chow. Mice were mated, and on day 7.5 of pregnancy plasma progesterone and prolactin were measured by immunoassay. Cells from the uterus-draining inguinal lymph nodes were collected for analysis of the uterine immune response by flow cytometry.\nDiet-induced obesity increased the secretion of progesterone and altered a number of uterine natural killer (NK)- and T-cell responses. These included a marked reduction in the percentage of leucocyte-derived NK cells and reduced expression of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in the NK cells compared with control mice.\nMaternal obesity, induced by an HF diet, may lead to a reduction in the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in NK cells. NK-cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 is reported to be involved in supporting uterine spiral artery remodelling. Thus, obesity in early pregnancy may compromise vascularization by reducing the expression of IFN-\u03b3-positive NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of uterine CD8(+) cells was reduced in the HF diet-fed mice, suggesting obesity may adversely alter the maternal immune adaptation that is essential for effective pregnancy.", "journal": "International journal of obesity (2005)", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["V JParker", "M ESolano", "P CArck", "A JDouglas"], "doi": "10.1038/ijo.2013.164"}
{"title": "Significance and function of different spinal collateral compartments following thoracic aortic surgery: immediate versus long-term flow compensation.", "abstract": "Iatrogenic paraplegia has been accompanying cardiovascular surgery since its beginning. As a result, surgeons have been developing many theories about the exact mechanisms of this devastating complication. Thus, the impact of single arteries that contribute to the spinal perfusion is one of the most discussed subjects in modern surgery. The subsequent decision of reattachment or the permanent disconnection of these intercostal arteries divides the surgical community. On the one hand, the anatomical or vascular approach pleads for the immediate reimplantation to reconstruct the anatomical situation. On the other hand, the decision of the permanent disconnection aims at avoiding stealing phenomenon away from the spinal vascular network. This spinal collateral network can be described as consisting of three components-the intraspinal and two paraspinal compartments-that feed the nutrient arteries of the spinal cord. The exact functional impact of the different compartments of the collateral network remains poorly understood. In this review, the function of the intraspinal compartment in the context of collateral network principle as an immediate emergency backup system is described. The exact structure and architectural principles of the intraspinal compartment are described. The critical parameters with regard to the risk of postoperative spinal cord ischaemia are the number of anterior radiculomedullary arteries (ARMAs) and the distance between them in relation to the longitudinal extent of aortic disease. The paraspinal network as a sleeping reserve is proposed as the long-term backup system. This sleeping reserve has to be activated by arteriogenic stimuli. These are presented briefly, and prior findings regarding arteriogenesis are discussed in the light of the collateral network concept.

{"title": "The role of angiogenic factors in fibroid pathogenesis: potential implications for future therapy.", "abstract": "It is well established that tumors are dependent on angiogenesis for their growth and survival. Although uterine fibroids are known to be benign tumors with reduced vascularization, recent work demonstrates that the vasculature of fibroids is grossly and microscopically abnormal. Accumulating evidence suggests that angiogenic growth factor dysregulation may be implicated in these vascular and other features of fibroid pathophysiology.\nLiterature searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles with content related to angiogenic growth factors and myometrium/leiomyoma. The findings are hereby reviewed and discussed.\nMultiple growth factors involved in angiogenesis are differentially expressed in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. These include epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding-EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and adrenomedullin. An important paradox is that although leiomyoma tissues are hypoxic, leiomyoma feature down-regulation of key molecular regulators of the hypoxia response. Furthermore, the hypoxic milieu of leiomyoma may contribute to fibroid development and growth. Notably, common treatments for fibroids such as GnRH agonists and uterine artery embolization (UAE) are shown to work at least partly via anti-angiogenic mechanisms.\nAngiogenic growth factors play an important role in mechanisms of fibroid pathophysiology, including abnormal vasculature and fibroid growth and survival. Moreover, the fibroid's abnormal vasculature together with its aberrant hypoxic and angiogenic response may make it especially vulnerable to disruption of its vascular supply, a feature which could be exploited for treatment.

{"title": "Scaffold biomaterials for nano-pathophysiology.", "abstract": "This review is intended to provide an overview of tissue engineering strategies using scaffold biomaterials to develop a vascularized tissue engineered construct for nano-pathophysiology. Two primary topics are discussed. The first is the biological or synthetic microenvironments that regulate cell behaviors in pathological conditions and tissue regeneration. Second is the use of scaffold biomaterials with angiogenic factors and/or cells to realize vascularized tissue engineered constructs for nano-pathophysiology. These topics are significantly overlapped in terms of three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of cells and blood vessels. Therefore, this review focuses on neovascularization of 3-D scaffold biomaterials induced by angiogenic factors and/or cells. The novel strategy of this approach in nano-pathophysiology is to utilize the vascularized tissue engineered construct as a tissue model to predict the distribution and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of a drug delivery system with different physicochemical and biological properties.", "journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "date": "2013-10-01", "authors": ["MasayaYamamoto", "ShahinRafii", "Sina YRabbany"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addr.2013.09.009"}

Two patients, who were treated with the designed flap, and with more than one year of follow-up, were reviewed. The technical innovations, end result and complications are described. In the two cases described, there was no recurrence of synostosis, which is the most frequent complication described in this condition, and no postoperative complications were observed. In the literature, many filler materials, from artificial to biological free or vascularized, have been used the radioulnar space after excision of synostosis. The technique that provides the best results is the interposition of muscle or vascularized adipofascial flaps. The Interosseous posterior antegrade flow pedicled flap is reliable, with a low morbidity, and is an effective alternative for the treatment of proximal radioulnar synostosis.", "journal": "Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia", "date": "2013-09-28", "authors": ["FMart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez", "J MMoreno-Fern\u00e1ndez", "AGarc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez", "VIzquierdo-Santiago", "SIllan-Franco"], "doi": "10.1016/j.recot.2013.07.009"}
{"title": "Boosting angiogenesis and functional vascularization in injectable dextran-hyaluronic acid hydrogels by endothelial-like mesenchymal stromal cells.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis and neovascularization are fundamental for the success of clinically relevant-sized tissue-engineered (TE) constructs. The next generation of TE constructs relies on providing instructive materials combined with the delivery of angiogenic growth factors and cells to avoid tissue ischemia. However, the majority of materials and cell types screened so far show limited clinical relevance, either due to insufficient number of cells or due to the use of animal-derived matrixes. Here, we investigated whether endothelial-like cells derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (EL-MSCs) can be used for vascular TE in combination with injectable dextran-hyaluronic acid (Dex-g-HA) hydrogels. These hydrogels can be easily modified, as demonstrated by the incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We examined in vitro the reciprocal influences between cells and matrix. Dex-g-HA enabled higher EL-MSC metabolic rates associated with optimal cell sprouting in vitro compared to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In vivo evaluation demonstrated the absence of an acute inflammatory response, and EL-MSCs incorporated within Dex-g-HA formed a functional vascular network integrated with the host vascular system. This work demonstrates that Dex-g-HA is an efficient delivery method of VEGF to induce angiogenesis. Additionally, functional neovascularization can be achieved in vitro and in vivo by the combination of Dex-g-HA with EL-MSC.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Electrosprayed microparticles with loaded pDNA-calcium phosphate nanoparticles to promote the regeneration of mature blood vessels.", "abstract": "The lack of control over microvasculature formation remains a key roadblock to the therapeutic vascularization and regeneration of functional tissues. In the current study, the integration of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensation and electrospraying technologies was proposed to promote the regeneration of mature blood vessels through injectable or infusible administration of microparticles.\nCalcium phosphate (CP) nanoparticles with encapsulated plasmids encoding vascular endothelial growth factors (pVEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (pbFGF) were synthesized using reverse microemulsions. Electrosprayed microparticles with the loading of CP-pDNA nanoparticles were evaluated on both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and after subcutaneous infusion into animals.\nCP-pDNA nanoparticles was obtained with an average size of around 110\u00a0nm and electrosprayed into microparticles, resulting in high loading efficiency and extended protection on pDNA from external DNase environment. The inoculation of poly(ethylene glycol) into microparticle matrices realized a gradual release for 4\u00a0weeks of CP-pDNA nanoparticles, leading to an incremental transfection efficiency and strong secretion of extracellular matrices. After subcutaneous infusion of microparticles with encapsulated both CP-pVEGF and CP-pbFGF nanoparticles, significantly higher densities of blood vessels were achieved than those containing individual nanoparticles, and induced a rapid generation of mature blood vessels with few cytotoxicity and inflammation reactions.\nElectrosprayed microparticle with CP-pDNA nanoparticles encapsulated promoted the formation of vascular networks, providing clinical relevance for therapeutic vascularization and regeneration of functional tissues after injection to ischemic sites or entrapment into tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["XueqinGuo", "TianXia", "HuanWang", "FangChen", "RongCheng", "XiaomingLuo", "XiaohongLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11095-013-1209-y"}

Dependent on the stimulus, SMC can either be in a proliferative (synthetic) or differentiated state. Alterations of SMC phenotype also appear in several disease settings, further contributing to disease progression.\nHere, we asked whether microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), which are strong posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, could alter SMC proliferation. Results and Innovation: Employing a robotic-assisted high-throughput screening method using miRNA libraries, we identified hypoxia-regulated miR-24 as a master regulator of SMC proliferation. Proteome profiling showed a strong miR-24-dependent impact on cellular stress-associated factors, overall resulting in reduced stress resistance. In vitro, synthetic miR-24 overexpression had detrimental effects on SMC functional capacity inducing apoptosis, migration defects, enhanced autophagy, and loss of contractile marker genes. Impaired SMC function was mediated in part by the herein identified direct target gene heme oxygenase 1. Ex vivo, miR-24 was shown to inhibit the development of vasculature in a model of engineered heart tissue.\nCollectively, we report the identification of the hypoxamir-24 as an inhibitor of SMC proliferation, contributing to loss of vascularization.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["JanFiedler", "AndreaSt\u00f6hr", "Shashi KumarGupta", "DorotheeHartmann", "AngelikaHolzmann", "AnnetteJust", "ArneHansen", "DeniseHilfiker-Kleiner", "ThomasEschenhagen", "ThomasThum"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2013.5418"}

Osteogenic differentiation of these cells is crucial to bone formation. Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF) is a sulfated polysaccharide that potentiates several growth factors, including pro-angiogenic growth factors. To investigate whether hASC preconditioning with LMWF promoted bone repair, we compared the effects of LMWF and low-molecular-weight heparin on hASC phenotype and osteogenic differentiation. LMWF did not modify the stem-cell phenotype of hASCs but enhanced their osteogenic differentiation (formation of calcium deposits, increased activity and expression of alkaline phosphatase, and increased expression of osteopontin and runt-related transcription factor 2). However, when hASCs were exposed to LMWF before their adhesion to biphasic calcium phosphate particles and implantation in a bone-growth mouse model, no bone formation was apparent after 5 or 8 weeks, probably due to cell death. In conclusion, LMWF may hold promise for enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs before their implantation.

However, the morphology of the cerebrovasculature and many circulatory anastomosis in the brain result in high variations in the extent of contrast agent filling in the blood vessels and as a result, the vasculature of different subjects appear differently in the acquired images. Specifically, the posterior circulation is not consistently perfused with the contrast agent in many brain specimens and thus, many major vessels that perfuse blood to the midbrain and hindbrain are not visible in the micro-CT images acquired from these samples.\nIn this paper, we present a modified surgical procedure of cerebral vasculature perfusion through the left ventricle with Microfil contrast agent, in order to achieve a more uniform perfusion of blood vessels throughout the brain and as a result, more consistent images of the cerebrovasculature. Our method consists of filling the posterior cerebral circulation with contrast agent, followed by the perfusion of the whole cerebrovasculature.\nOur histological results show that over 90% of the vessels in the entire brain, including the cerebellum, were filled with contrast agent.\nOur results show that the new technique of sample perfusion decreases the variability of the posterior circulation in the cerebellum in micro-CT images by 6.9%.\nThis new technique of sample preparation improves the quality of cerebrovascular images.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2013-09-24", "authors": ["SaharGhanavati", "Lisa XYu", "Jason PLerch", "John GSled"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.09.002"}

Additional aims were to elucidate the surface receptors and to investigate the role of the intracellular signaling pathways by blocking the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Jak-2 protein tyrosine kinase (JAK2), and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). The primary outcome measures were two mineralization assays, Arsenazo III and alizarin red, applied after 10, 14, and 21 days. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase activity, cell number, and cell viability were determined after 2 and 7 days. A proportional dose-response relationship was observed. In vivo, the lowest effective dose of 20 IU/ml should be used for further research to accommodate safety concerns about adverse effects. Ex vivo, the most effective dose of 100 IU/ml could facilitate vascularization and bone ingrowth in cell-based scaffolds.

Tumors can occur in many sites in the body, but how surrounding normal tissues at different anatomical sites affect tumor microenvironments and their subsequent response to therapy is not known.We demonstrated that tumors from renal, colon, or prostate cell lines in orthotopic locations responded to immunotherapy consisting of three agonist antibodies, termed Tri-mAb, to a much lesser extent than the same tumor type located subcutaneously. A tissue-specific response to Tri-mAb was confirmed by ex vivo separation of subcutaneous (SC) or orthotopic tumor cells from stromal cells, followed by reinjection of tumor cells into the opposite site. Compared with SC tumors, orthotopic tumors had a microenvironment associated with a type 2 immune response, related to immunosuppression, and an involvement of alternatively activated macrophages in the kidney model. Orthotopic kidney tumors were more highly vascularized than SC tumors. Neutralizing the macrophage- and Th2-associated molecules chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 or interleukin-13 led to a significantly improved therapeutic effect.

{"title": "In vitro mimics of bone remodeling and the vicious cycle of cancer in bone.", "abstract": "Bone remodeling is a natural process that enables growth and maintenance of the skeleton. It involves the deposition of mineralized matrix by osteoblasts and resorption by osteoclasts. Several cancers that metastasize to bone negatively perturb the remodeling process through a series of interactions with osteoclasts, and osteoblasts. These interactions have been described as the \"vicious cycle\" of cancer metastasis in bone. Due to the inaccessibility of the skeletal tissue, it is difficult to study this system in vivo. In contrast, standard tissue culture lacks sufficient complexity. We have developed a specialized three-dimensional culture system that permits growth of a non-vascularized, multiple-cell-layer of mineralized osteoblastic tissue from pre-osteoblasts. In this study, the essential properties of bone remodeling were created in vitro by co-culturing the mineralized collagenous osteoblastic tissue with actively resorbing osteoclasts followed by reinfusion with proliferating pre-osteoblasts. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions were determined by confocal microscopy as well as by assays for cell specific cytokines and growth factors. Osteoclasts, differentiated in the presence of osteoblasts, led to degradation of the collagen-rich extracellular matrix. Further addition of metastatic breast cancer cells to the co-culture mimicked the vicious cycle; there was a further reduction in osteoblastic tissue thickness, an increase in osteoclastogenesis, chemotaxis of cancer cells to osteoclasts and formation of cancer cells into large colonies. The resulting model system permits detailed study of fundamental osteobiological and osteopathological processes in a manner that will enhance development of therapeutic interventions to skeletal diseases.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2013-09-12", "authors": ["VenkateshKrishnan", "Erwin AVogler", "Donna MSosnoski", "Andrea MMastro"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.24464"}

Recent studies have shown that vascularization and ossification can be stimulated by mild heat stress (MHS), which would offer the option to enhance the bone regeneration process by relatively simple means. However, the mechanisms of MHS-enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis, as well as potential risks for the treated cells are unclear. We have investigated the direct effect of MHS on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in a co-culture system of human outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) and primary osteoblasts (pOBs), and assessed cytotoxic effects, as well as the levels of various heat shock proteins (HSPs) synthesized under these conditions. Enhanced formation of microvessel-like structures was observed in co-cultures exposed to MHS (41\u00b0C, 1 h), twice per week, over a time period of 7-14 days. As shown by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was up-regulated in MHS-treated co-cultures 24 h post-treatment. At the protein level, significantly elevated VEGF and Ang-1 concentrations were observed in MHS-treated co-cultures and pOB mono-cultures compared with controls, indicating paracrine effects associated with MHS-induced angiogenesis. MHS-stimulated co-cultures and OEC mono-cultures released higher levels of Ang-2 than untreated cultures. On the other hand MHS treatment of co-cultures did not result in a clear effect regarding osteogenesis. Nevertheless, real-time PCR demonstrated that MHS increased the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase, interleukin-6, and bone morphogenetic protein 2, known as HSP-related molecules in angiogenic and osteogenic regulation pathways. In agreement with these observations, the expression of some selected HSPs also increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in MHS-treated co-cultures.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Relaxin exerts its functions via the receptor RXFP1. Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) in contrast acts through the related receptor RXFP2, and plays an essential role in the production of androgens within growing antral follicles. INSL3 is also produced in large amounts by the male fetus shortly after sex determination, where it controls the first transabdominal phase of testicular descent. However, this fetal INSL3 is also able to influence placental and maternal physiology, indicating associations with later preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction. Other members of this relaxin-like family of peptides, such as INSL4, INSL5 and INSL6 are less well studied, though all suggest modulatory roles in ovarian and/or placental function.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular endocrinology", "date": "2013-09-03", "authors": ["RavinderAnand-Ivell", "RichardIvell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mce.2013.08.010"}
{"title": "Regulation of placental angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Ample interest has been evoked in using placental angiogenesis as a target for the development of diagnosis tools and potential therapeutics for pregnancy complications based on the knowledge of placental angiogenesis in normal and aberrant pregnancies. Although these goals are still far from reach, one would expect that two complementary processes should be balanced for therapeutic angiogenesis to be successful in restoring a mature and functional vascular network in the placenta in any pregnancy complication: (i) pro-angiogenic stimulation of new vessel growth and (ii) anti-angiogenic inhibition of vessel overgrowth. As the best model of physiological angiogenesis, investigations of placental angiogenesis provide critical insights not only for better understanding of normal placental endothelial biology but also for the development of diagnosis tools for pregnancy complications. Such investigations will potentially identify novel pro-angiogenic factors for therapeutic intervention for tissue damage in various obstetric complications or heart failure or anti-angiogenic factors to target on cancer or vision loss in which circulation needs to be constrained.

The reference treatment for intermediary stages of the Barcelona (B) classification is hepatic artery chemoembolization. The aim of chemoembolization is to inject the tumor chemotherapy into the artery and then to embolize the artery (or arteries), which supply the tumor. For this, knowledge of the anatomy of the hepatic artery is essential. Approximately 55% of the patients belong to the modal distribution, although numerous anatomical variants exist and must be recognized. In addition, primarily non-hepatic arteries may contribute to the vascularization of some hepatocellular carcinomas. Furthermore, new arterial supplies can be recruited by tumors after surgical or chemoembolization treatments. The aim of this article is to describe the different arteries, which may vascularize hepatocellular carcinomas.

This study is novel because no osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation protocols were applied to the cells prior to implantation. After 6 weeks, X-ray, microCT, and histological analysis showed that the hESC-MCs had consistently formed a highly vascularized new bone that bridged the bone defect and seamlessly integrated with host bone. The implanted hESC-MCs differentiated in situ to functional hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes forming new bone tissue via an endochondral ossification pathway. Evidence for the direct participation of the human cells in bone morphogenesis was verified by two separate assays: with Alu and by human mitochondrial antigen positive staining in conjunction with co-localized expression of human bone sialoprotein in histologically verified regions of new bone. The large volume of new bone in a calvarial defect and the direct participation of the hESC-MCs far exceeds that of previous studies and that of the control adult hMSCs. This study represents a key step forward for bone tissue engineering because of the large volume, vascularity, and reproducibility of new bone formation and the discovery that it is advantageous to not over-commit these progenitor cells to a particular lineage prior to implantation.

{"title": "Tbx1 regulates brain vascularization.", "abstract": "The transcription factor TBX1 is the major gene involved in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Using mouse models of these diseases, we have previously shown that TBX1 activates VEGFR3 in endothelial cells (EC), and that this interaction is critical for the development of the lymphatic vasculature. In this study, we show that TBX1 regulates brain angiogenesis. Using loss-of-function genetics and molecular approaches, we show that TBX1 regulates the VEGFR3 and DLL4 genes in brain ECs. In mice, loss of TBX1 causes global brain vascular defects, comprising brain vessel hyperplasia, enhanced angiogenic sprouting and vessel network disorganization. This phenotype is recapitulated in EC-specific Tbx1 conditional mutants and in an EC-only 3-dimensional cell culture system (matrigel), indicating that the brain vascular phenotype is cell autonomous. Furthermore, EC-specific conditional Tbx1 mutants have poorly perfused brain vessels and brain hypoxia, indicating that the expanded vascular network is functionally impaired. In EC-matrigel cultures, a Notch1 agonist is able to partially rescue microtubule hyperbranching induced by TBX1 knockdown. Thus, we have identified a novel transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis that exerts its effect in brain by negatively regulating angiogenesis through the DLL4/Notch1-VEGFR3 regulatory axis. Given the similarity of the phenotypic consequences of TBX1 mutation in humans and mice, this unexpected role of TBX1 in murine brain vascularization should stimulate clinicians to search for brain microvascular anomalies in 22q11.2DS patients and to evaluate whether some of the anatomical and functional brain anomalies in patients may have a microvascular origin.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2013-08-16", "authors": ["SaraCioffi", "StefaniaMartucciello", "Filomena GabriellaFulcoli", "MarchesaBilio", "RosaFerrentino", "EdoardoNusco", "ElizabethIllingworth"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddt400"}

Large volumes of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) that functionally interact with osteoblasts during osteogenesis are difficult to obtain. In this study, we simulated bone healing by co-culturing differentiated ECs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) either on a culture plate or on a polylactide glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffold in vitro. We also evaluated the effect of osteogenesis in repairing rabbit mandible defects in vivo. In this study, MSCs were separated from rabbit as the seed cells. After passage, the MSCs were cultured in an EC-conditioned medium to differentiate into ECs. Immunohistochemical staining analysis with CD34 showed that the induced cells had the characteristics of ECs and MSC. The induced ECs were co-cultured in vitro, and the induction of MSCs to osteoblast served as the control. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red (AZR) staining experiments were performed, and the Coomassie brilliant blue total protein and ALP activity were measured. The MSCs proliferated and differentiated into osteoblast-like cells through direct contact between the derived ECs and MSCs. The co-cultured cells were seeded on PLGA scaffold to repair 1 cm mandible defects in the rabbit. The effectiveness of the repairs was assessed through soft X-ray and histological analyses. The main findings indicated that MSCs survived well on the scaffold and that the scaffold is biocompatible and noncytotoxic. The results demonstrated that the co-cultured MSC-derived ECs improved MSC osteogenesis and promoted new bone formation.

Nevertheless, fibrin presents a complex milieu of signals to embedded cells, many of which are not well understood. Synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs) provide a blank slate that can ostensibly be populated with specific bioactive cues, including growth factors, growth factor binding motifs, adhesive peptides and peptide crosslinks susceptible to proteases, thereby enabling a degree of customization for specific applications.

{"title": "NG2 proteoglycan promotes tumor vascularization via integrin-dependent effects on pericyte function.", "abstract": "The NG2 proteoglycan stimulates the proliferation and migration of various immature cell types, including pericytes. However, the role of NG2 in mediating pericyte/endothelial cell interaction has been less clear. In this study, we show that pericyte-specific NG2 ablation causes several structural deficits in blood vessels in intracranial B16F10 melanomas, including decreased pericyte ensheathment of endothelial cells, diminished formation of endothelial junctions, and reduced assembly of the vascular basal lamina. These deficits result in decreased tumor vessel patency, increased vessel leakiness, and increased intratumoral hypoxia. NG2-dependent mechanisms of pericyte interaction with endothelial cells are further explored in pericyte/endothelial cell co-cultures. siRNA-mediated NG2 knockdown in pericytes leads to reduced formation of pericyte/endothelial networks, reduced formation of ZO-1 positive endothelial cell junctions, and increased permeability of endothelial cell monolayers.

Previously, cell isolation devices have been based on hollow fiber membranes, porous polymer scaffolds, alginate systems, or micro-machined membranes. We present the development and characterization of a novel dual porosity electrospun membrane based device, which supports cellular infiltration and vascularization of its outer porous layer and maintains cellular isolation within a lumen bounded by an inner low porosity layer. Electrospinning conditions were initially established to support electrospun fiber deposition onto nonconductive silicone surfaces. With these parameters established, devices for in vivo evaluations were produced using nylon as a nonconductive scaffold for deposition of dual porosity electrospun fibers. The outer porous layer supported the development of a penetrating microcirculation and the membrane supported the transfer of insulin from encapsulated sustained release pellets for 4 weeks. Viable cells implanted within the device could be identified after 2 weeks of implantation. Through the successful demonstration of survival and cellular isolation of human epithelial cells within the implanted devices and the ability to use the device to deliver insulin, we have established the utility of this device toward localized cell transplantation. The cell delivery device establishes a platform to test the feasibility of approaches to cell dose control and cell localization at the site of implantation in the clinical use of modified autologous or allogeneic cells.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Surface density of vascular endothelial growth factor modulates endothelial proliferation and differentiation.", "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies aim to regulate vasculature either by encouraging vessel growth for tissue engineering or inhibiting vascularization around a tumor. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential to these processes, and there are several strategies that manipulate VEGF signaling. Here we develop a method to control the surface density of VEGF, which is covalently attached to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), and explore cellular responses to surfaces with varying VEGF densities. We show that the crosslinker reduces but does not eliminate the biological activity of soluble VEGF as measured by endothelial proliferation. However, endothelial cells cultured on surfaces of covalently bound VEGF did not proliferate in response to surface cues. Interestingly, compared to cells incubated with soluble VEGF (10 ng/ml) and cultured on TCPS, lower cell proliferation was observed when endothelial cells were cultured on high VEGF surface densities (5.9 ng/cm(2)), whereas higher cell proliferation occurred when cells were cultured on low surface densities (0.04 ng/cm(2)). High density surfaces (5.9 ng/cm(2)) also acted in synergy with an inhibitor of VEGF receptors to further suppress endothelial cell proliferation. We also examined the effect of VEGF surfaces on endothelial differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. No effect was observed when cells were cultured on VEGF surfaces; however, the VEGF surfaces acted in synergy with an inhibitor of VEGF receptors to decrease the ability of differentiated cells to form vascular networks. Together, these results suggest that surface density of bound VEGF can be used to modulate cell behavior and inhibit an angiogenic response.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2013-08-06", "authors": ["Richard JGalas", "Julie CLiu"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.24638"}

The remodeling of vascular structures through generation of new vessels (for example, via tumor angiogenesis) is a well studied, even if still quite poorly understood, process in human cancer. Antiangiogenic therapies have provided insight into the contribution of angiogenesis to the biology of human tumors, yet have also revealed the ease with which resistance to antiangiogenic drugs can develop, presumably involving alterations to vascular signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, cellular and/or molecular changes to pre-existing vessels could represent subtle pre-metastatic alterations to the vasculature, which are important for cancer progression. These changes, and associated molecular markers, may forecast the behavior of individual tumors and contribute to the early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

Grafts were used for defects caused by mandible tumors in 2 patients and firearm injuries in 9 patients. Reconstruction was achieved by using various non-vascularized bones, including iliac crest, fibula and scapula. To improve graft supply, periosteum of the grafts was spared and multiple bores were created on the graft during surgery by drilling.

These flaps have the advantage of being performed on all skin perforators and in reducing donor site morbidity. The disadvantage, however is that the size of their angiosome is not defined and the evaluation of their relay on the experience of the surgeon. An evaluation of the size of an angiosome by conducting intraoperative angiography is proposed. Intraoperative angiography is performed after injection of indocyanine green. Stimulation of the indocyanine green by infrared causes the emission of fluorescent radiation. This fluorescence is then detected by a specific camera that displays real-time visualization of the skin's perfusion. We present the case of a 39-year-old patient who had an open tibial pilon fracture, for which we performed a pedicled propeller flap based on a posterior tibial perforator. Angiography was used to determine accurately the optimal skin perfusion of the propeller flap, which was based on a perforator from the posterior tibial artery. Angiography identified several levels of skin perfusion with a high fluorescence, intermediate and absent. The non-vascularized part of the skin paddle was resected. Given the unreliability of this technique, hypoperfused area was retained. Debridment of this area, however was necessary at day 5 postoperative with repositionning of the flap. Indocyanine green angiography may be a useful decision-making tool for intraoperative surgeon. It allows to adjust the size of the propeller flap's skin paddle to it angiosome.

The OITT approach is appropriate for the treatment of these AVMs if they are located midline or paramedian and vascularized preferentially by the rostral branches of the superior cerebellar arteries. For AVMs extending beyond midline, deep to the fourth ventricles, or caudally to the cerebellar tonsils; and/or vascularized by caudal branches of the superior cerebellar arteries, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and/or posterior inferior cerebellar arteries; or having an aneurysm on any of these arteries, the OITT alone may not be appropriate. Preoperative embolization can target contralateral, deep, and caudal feeders or aneurysms, potentially rendering the OITT a favorable route. The OITT can also be combined with other approaches for AVMs that extend caudally with multiple feeders.\nThe OITT is a valuable approach for specific superior vermian, superomedian cerebellar, and tectal AVMs. Detailed assessment of angiographic features may however preclude its safety as a unique treatment plan, and complementary or alternative therapeutic options should be considered.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["NancyMcLaughlin", "Neil AMartin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2013.07.075"}

We investigated the angiogenic/antiangiogenic properties of equine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eBMSCs) before and after differentiation in vitro. Conditioned media from chondrogenic and osteogenic cell pellets and undifferentiated cells was applied to endothelial tube formation assays using Matrigel\u2122. Additionally, the cell secretome was analysed using LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and screened for angiogenesis and neurogenesis-related factors using protein arrays. Endothelial tube-like formation was supported by conditioned media from undifferentiated eBMSCs. Conversely, chondrogenic and osteogenic conditioned media was antiangiogenic as shown by significantly decreased length of endothelial tube-like structures and degree of branching compared to controls. Undifferentiated cells produced higher levels of angiogenesis-related proteins compared to chondrogenic and osteogenic pellets. In summary, eBMSCs produce an array of angiogenesis-related proteins and support angiogenesis in vitro via a paracrine mechanism.

The initial benign diagnoses on biopsy specimens included fibrous dysplasia in three cases, chondroblastoma in one case, and a giant cell tumor in one case. The average number of histological examinations was 1.8. Low-grade osteosarcomas are well suited for biological reconstruction: seven cases were reconstructed by frozen autografts, distraction osteogenesis, or vascularized bone grafts.\nLow-grade osteosarcomas can be misdiagnosed as benign lesions, especially fibrous dysplasia. If the diagnosis of a low-grade osteosarcoma is not established on the basis of radiologic findings, care should be exercised, even when a biopsy suggests a benign lesion. Low-grade osteosarcomas should be treated with wide excision, even after an intralesional excision. Biological reconstruction might be a better option for low-grade osteosarcomas.", "journal": "International journal of clinical oncology", "date": "2013-07-25", "authors": ["KatsuhiroHayashi", "HiroyukiTsuchiya", "NorioYamamoto", "ToshiharuShirai", "HidejiNishida", "AkihikoTakeuchi", "HiroakiKimura", "ShinjiMiwa", "HiroyukiInatani", "HidekiOkamoto", "SatoshiYamada", "HirokoIkeda", "SeikoSawada-Kitamura", "TakayukiNojima", "AkishiOoi", "TakanobuOtsuka"], "doi": "10.1007/s10147-013-0592-z"}

Therefore, we wanted to investigate direct effects of DPO on the liver tumor cell lines HepG2, SkHep1, Huh-7, AKN1, HCC-T and HCC-M, as well as on primary human hepatocytes (hHeps). DPO (0-40\u00a0ng/ml) did not affect viability of hHeps, HepG2, SkHep1, AKN1, HCC-T and HCC-M cells, as determined by Resazurin conversion. However, Huh-7 cells' viability dose-dependently decreased from 5\u00a0ng/ml DPO on. Lack of LDH release into culture medium and negative DNA laddering excluded apoptosis or necrosis as the cause for the reduced Resazurin conversion. In Huh-7 cells, DPO increased the expression of p53. Interestingly, Huh-7 cells showed the highest basal TGF-\u03b21 expression as compared to the other cell lines. Upon inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signaling, DPO no longer reduced viability in Huh-7 cells. On the contrary, co-incubation with TGF-\u03b21 made the other cell lines responsive to DPO. Summarizing our data, we show that DPO reduces the growth of Huh-7 cells by up-regulation of the tumor-suppressor gene p53. This mechanism seems to be dependent on a strong TGF-\u03b2 expression and corresponding signaling in these cells, as other cell lines became responsive to DPO with TGF-\u03b21 supplementation.

{"title": "Neonatal human dermal fibroblasts immobilized in RGD-alginate induce angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Promoting angiogenesis in a damaged tissue is a major challenge for tissue regeneration. Recent findings in tissue engineering suggest that fibroblasts (FBs) play an important role in orchestrating the angiogenic process. Fibroblasts maintain the structural integrity of connective tissue by continuously secreting growth factors and extracellular matrix precursors, which are essential for endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and spreading, thus playing a crucial role in angiogenesis. We hypothesized that FBs immobilized in alginate gels grafted with the RGD peptidic sequence could influence the recruitment of ECs to improve vascularization. In this work, the modulation of immobilized human FBs within the 3D synthetic extracellular matrix was assessed. Experiments using cocultures of ECs and FBs in indirect contact as well as angiogenic assays were performed to assess the influence of FBs immobilized in RGD-alginate in ECs' viability, stabilization, sprouting, and assembly into capillary-like structures. This study demonstrates the ability of FBs immobilized within RGD-alginate microspheres to modulate and support capillary-like structures' assembly.

{"title": "Delayed bone regeneration is linked to chronic inflammation in murine muscular dystrophy.", "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients exhibit skeletal muscle weakness with continuous cycles of muscle fiber degeneration/regeneration, chronic inflammation, low bone mineral density, and increased risks of fracture. Fragility fractures and associated complications are considered as a consequence of the osteoporotic condition in these patients. Here, we aimed to establish the relationship between muscular dystrophy and fracture healing by assessing bone regeneration in mdx mice, a model of DMD with absence of osteoporosis. Our results illustrate that muscle defects in mdx mice impact the process of bone regeneration at various levels. In mdx fracture calluses, both cartilage and bone deposition were delayed followed by a delay in cartilage and bone remodeling. Vascularization of mdx fracture calluses was also decreased during the early stages of repair. Dystrophic muscles are known to contain elevated numbers of macrophages contributing to muscle degeneration. Accordingly, we observed increased macrophage recruitment in the mdx fracture calluses and abnormal macrophage accumulation throughout the process of bone regeneration. These changes in the inflammatory environment subsequently had an impact on the recruitment of osteoclasts and the remodeling phase of repair. Further damage to the mdx muscles, using a novel model of muscle trauma, amplified both the chronic inflammatory response and the delay in bone regeneration. In addition, PLX3397 treatment of mdx mice, a cFMS (colony stimulating factor receptor 1) inhibitor in monocytes, partially rescued the bone repair defect through increasing cartilage deposition and decreasing the number of macrophages. In conclusion, chronic inflammation in mdx mice contributes to the fracture healing delay and is associated with a decrease in angiogenesis and a transient delay in osteoclast recruitment. By revealing the role of dystrophic muscle in regulating the inflammatory response during bone repair, our results emphasize the implication of muscle in the normal bone repair process and may lead to improved treatment of fragility fractures in DMD patients.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2013-07-17", "authors": ["RanaAbou-Khalil", "FrankYang", "MarieMortreux", "ShirleyLieu", "Yan-YiuYu", "MaudWurmser", "CatiaPereira", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricRelaix", "TheodoreMiclau", "Ralph SMarcucio", "C\u00e9lineColnot"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2038"}

Vascularized flaps are the option of choice, whether free or pedicled. Free flaps have the added benefit of access to the more cephalad defects of the anterior cranial base without the constraints of the rotation arc of pedicled flaps. The authors compared various flaps used for the reconstruction of defects of the anterior or middle skull base after resection of malignant tumors.\nThe authors identified 12 patients in whom 14 flaps were performed. All patients had malignant neoplasms extending to the anterior or middle cranial base that were reconstructed with free or pedicled flaps. A retrospective analysis was performed to compare the characteristics of patient demographics, tumor, and surgical technique. Complications among the various flaps were compared. Patients' assessments of function and quality of life were assessed by conducting a telephone survey.\nMost patients had stage 3 or 4 squamous cell carcinoma originating in the paranasal sinuses and extending to the anterior or middle skull base, requiring orbital exenteration. The flaps used included 6 radial forearm free flaps (RFFFs), 3 anterolateral thigh flaps (ALTs), 4 thoracodorsal artery perforator free flaps (TDAPs), and 1 pedicled supraclavicular flap. There were no major complications, such as perioperative heart attack, stroke, death, or meningitis. Minor complications included 3 mesh exposures after radiation treatment, 1 wound infection, and 2 flaps with wound dehiscence after radiation. These 2 dehiscences were seen with RFFFs and were later reoperated using TDAPs. There were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks or donor-site morbidity. There were no complaints of functional deficits, such as feeding difficulties or speech impairments. Some visual disturbance was reported after orbital exenteration, although this was an expected outcome.\nVascularized flaps provide reliable and durable reconstructive options for anterior and middle skull base defects after resection of large complex malignant neoplasms of the craniofacial region.

{"title": "Tumour-stroma interactions in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: rationale and current evidence for new therapeutic strategies.", "abstract": "Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced/metastatic disease and have a dismal prognosis. Despite the proven albeit modest benefits of gemcitabine demonstrated over a decade ago, subsequent advances have been slow, suggesting it may be time to take a different approach. It is thought that some key characteristics of pancreatic cancer, such as the desmoplasia, restricted vasculature and hypoxic environment, may prevent the delivery of chemotherapy to the tumour thereby explaining the limited benefits observed to-date. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the stroma is not only a mechanical barrier but also constitutes a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumours that is critically involved in tumour formation, progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting the stroma and the tumour represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Currently, several stroma-targeting agents are entering clinical development. Among these, nab-paclitaxel appears promising since it combines cytotoxic therapy with targeted delivery via its proposed ability to bind SPARC on tumour and stromal cells. Preclinical data indicate that co-treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine results in stromal depletion, increased tumour vascularization and intratumoural gemcitabine concentration, and increased tumour regression compared with either agent alone. Phase I/II study data also suggest that a high level of antitumor activity can be achieved with this combination in pancreatic cancer. This was recently confirmed in a Phase III study which showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved overall survival (HR 0.72) and progression-free survival (HR 0.69) versus gemcitabine alone for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.", "journal": "Cancer treatment reviews", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["VHeinemann", "MReni", "MYchou", "D JRichel", "TMacarulla", "MDucreux"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ctrv.2013.04.004"}
{"title": "Lamina propria: the functional center of the bladder?", "abstract": "The bladder mucosa consists of the urothelium, basement membrane, and lamina propria (LP). Although the urothelium has been given much attention, it may be regarded as one part of a signaling system involving another equally important component of the bladder mucosa, namely, the LP. The LP lies between the basement membrane of the mucosa and the detrusor muscle and is composed of an extracellular matrix containing several types of cells, including fibroblasts, adipocytes, interstitial cells, and afferent and efferent nerve endings. In addition, the LP contains a rich vascular network, lymphatic vessels, elastic fibers, and smooth muscle fascicles (muscularis mucosae). The roles of the LP and its components in bladder function have not been definitively established, though it has been suggested to be the capacitance layer of the bladder, determining bladder compliance and enabling adaptive changes to increasing volumes. However, the bladder LP may also serve as a communication center, with an important integrative role in signal transduction to the central nervous system (nociception, mechanosensation). The LP may also, by means of its different components, make it possible for the urothelium to transmit information to other components of the bladder wall, contributing to activation of the detrusor muscle.

It does so by stimulating a sequence of well studied anti-apoptotic pro-survival mechanisms in a similar manner to various 'ischemic' pre-/post-conditioning approaches which achieve their cardio protective effects in both laboratory and clinical situations. Proliferation of newly formed blood vessels, resulting in formation of highly vascularized granulation tissue, is an essential stage of infarct healing. It can be evaluated by detecting various angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) or by quantification of expression of vascular smooth muscle progenitors, such as Nestin. Expression of these three markers was used to evaluate the effect of early isoflurane post-conditioning in ischemia-reperfusion type cardiac injury. A large reduction in infarct size (59.3% of control), and marked increase of expression of VEGF (43.4%), PECAM-1/CD31 (136%) and Nestin (77.9%) was found in experimental animals when compared to control animals that did not receive isoflurane treatment.

Controversy exists, therefore, over the indications and risk/benefit ratios of VCA. Transplantation failure is a basic measurable risk of VCA. In this report we attempt to analyze perioperative factors associated with failures. Such factors are generally independent of technical performance and can be assessed to better define regulations applied to VCA. Ninety-one VCA procedures were identified, and 18 (19.8%) of them failed. Significant (P < 0.05) failure rates were associated with idiosyncratic cases (100%), cases performed without psychological screening (56.3%), cases performed without competent social support systems (44%), and cases done in developing countries (52.4%). A substantial but not significant failure rate was observed in cases performed without institutional review (36.4%). These findings suggest that institutional, professional, social, and ethical standards applied to VCA should require clarification of perioperative risk managements for any clinical VCA program, because such managements can be critical factors in determining outcome.

Clinical examination revealed corneal edema and vascularization, marked hypopyon, and thickening of the dorsal iris, which was confirmed by ultrasonography. Hematologic and biochemical analyses, abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography, and abdominocentesis with cytologic and biochemical analysis revealed no significant abnormalities. Cytological examination of an aqueous humor sample revealed a population of predominantly large lymphoblasts with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round or irregular nuclei, clumped nuclear chromatin, multiple large prominent nucleoli, and a small volume of basophilic cytoplasm. The cytologic diagnosis was intraocular lymphoma. Biopsy of the right submandibular lymph node revealed no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Euthanasia and a complete necropsy were performed and revealed no evidence of neoplasia in any tissue other than the right eye, which had an extensive, well-defined infiltrate of neoplastic lymphocytes expanding the ciliary body and iris, infiltrating the ciliary epithelium, and extending into the pars plana and peripheral choroid. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that neoplastic cells expressed the T-cell marker CD3. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of primary, solitary uveal T-cell lymphoma in a horse. Although apparently rare, lymphoma should be considered in horses with uveitis, even when inflammation is unilateral and in the absence of extraocular signs of neoplasia.

{"title": "Water transport across the peritoneal membrane.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis involves diffusive and convective transports and osmosis through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. The capillary endothelium offers the rate-limiting hindrance for solute and water transport. It can be functionally described in terms of a three-pore model including transcellular, ultrasmall pores responsible for free-water transport during crystalloid osmosis. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) corresponds to the ultrasmall pore located in endothelial cells. Studies in Aqp1 mice have shown that deletion of AQP1 is reflected by a 50% decrease in ultrafiltration and a disappearance of the sodium sieving. Haploinsufficiency in AQP1 is also reflected by a significant attenuation of water transport. Conversely, studies in a rat model and in PD patients have shown that the induction of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries by corticosteroids is reflected by increased water transport and ultrafiltration, without affecting the osmotic gradient and small-solute transport. Recent data have demonstrated that a novel agonist of AQP1, predicted to stabilize the open-state conformation of the channel, modulates water transport and improves ultrafiltration. Whether increasing the expression of AQP1 or gating the already existing channels would be clinically useful in PD patients remains to be investigated.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2013-06-27", "authors": ["OlivierDevuyst", "BengtRippe"], "doi": "10.1038/ki.2013.250"}

Blood vessel formation in tumors is the result of rapid, disorganized vascular growth through two distinct mechanisms: sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to elucidate the morphological aspects of these two vascular growth mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma induced in hamster buccal pouch. Eight Syrian golden hamsters had their right buccal pouch treated with DMBA 0.5% and 10% carbamide peroxide for 90 days in order to produce squamous cell carcinoma in this site. Next, buccal pouches of the animals were submitted to the vascular corrosion technique and then analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The vascular figures of sprouts were observed in the entire vascular network of the buccal pouches, as opposed to the intussusceptive angiogenesis that was predominantly observed in the sub-epithelial network. It was possible to differentiate the figures of sprouts from artifacts by the analysis of the blind ending of these structures. Intussusceptive angiogenesis was identified by the presence of holes trespassing the lumen of the capillaries. Vascular expansion occurred through intussusceptive angiogenesis in two ways: by the fusion of the pillars to form a new capillary and, by increasing the girth of the pillar to form meshes.

In this respect, BPC 157 was concluded to be the most potent angiomodulatory agent, acting through different vasoactive pathways and systems (e.g. NO, VEGF, FAK) and leading to optimization of the vascular response followed, as it has to be expected, by optimization of the healing process. Formation of new blood vessels involves two main, partly overlapping mechanisms, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The additional mechanism of arteriogenesis is involved in the formation of collaterals. In conjunction with blood vessel function, we at least have to consider leakage of fluid/proteins/plasma, resulting in edema/exudate formation as well as thrombogenesis.

We have established the animal model of the gastric MALT lymphoma by the Helicobacter heilmannii (H. heilmannii) peroral infection of C57BL/6 mice. The disease induced by this model is very similar to the human counterpart, because of the lymphoepithelial lesion characteristic of the human MALT lymphoma as well as the rich vascularization and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, Flt-1, Flk-1 and Flt-4. By administering VEGF receptor antibodies or celecoxib, one of the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, we were able to induce a significant decrease in the size of the tumor and the apoptotic changes of the endothelial cells of the microvascular network.

{"title": "Accelerating the early angiogenesis of tissue engineering constructs in vivo by the use of stem cells cultured in matrigel.", "abstract": "In tissue engineering research, generating constructs with an adequate extent of clinical applications remains a major challenge. In this context, rapid blood vessel ingrowth in the transplanted tissue engineering constructs is the key factor for successful incorporation. To accelerate the microvascular development in engineered tissues, we preincubated osteoblast-like cells as well as mesenchymal stem cells or a combination of both cell types in Matrigel-filled PLGA scaffolds before transplantation into the dorsal skinfold chambers of balb/c mice. By the use of preincubated mesenchymal stem cells, a significantly accelerated angiogenesis was achieved. Compared with previous studies that showed a decisive increase of vascularization on day 6 after the implantation, we were able to halve this period and achieve explicitly denser microvascular networks 3 days after transplantation of the tissue engineering constructs. Thereby, the inflammatory host tissue response was acceptable and low, comparable with former investigations. A co-incubation of osteoblast-like cells and stem cells showed no additive effect on the density of the newly formed microvascular network. Preincubation of mesenchymal stem cells in Matrigel is a promising approach to develop rapid microvascular growth into tissue engineering constructs. After the implantation into the host organism, scaffolds comprising stem cells generate microvascular capillary-like structures exceptionally fast. Thereby, transplanted stem cells likely differentiate into vessel-associated cells. For this reason, preincubation of mesenchymal stem cells in nutrient solutions supporting different steps of angiogenesis provides a technique to promote the routine use of tissue engineering in the clinic.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Adipose tissue angiogenesis: impact on obesity and type-2 diabetes.", "abstract": "The growth and function of tissues are critically dependent on their vascularization. Adipose tissue is capable of expanding many-fold during adulthood, therefore requiring the formation of new vasculature to supply growing and proliferating adipocytes. The expansion of the vasculature in adipose tissue occurs through angiogenesis, where new blood vessels develop from those pre-existing within the tissue. Inappropriate angiogenesis may underlie adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, which in turn increases type-2 diabetes risk. In addition, genetic and developmental factors involved in vascular patterning may define the size and expandability of diverse adipose tissue depots, which are also associated with type-2 diabetes risk. Moreover, the adipose tissue vasculature appears to be the niche for pre-adipocyte precursors, and factors that affect angiogenesis may directly impact the generation of new adipocytes. Here we review recent advances on the basic mechanisms of angiogenesis, and on the role of angiogenesis in adipose tissue development and obesity. A substantial amount of data points to a deficit in adipose tissue angiogenesis as a contributing factor to insulin resistance and metabolic disease in obesity. These emerging findings support the concept of the adipose tissue vasculature as a source of new targets for metabolic disease therapies.

{"title": "Single-cell suspension methodology favors survival and vascularization of fetal striatal grafts in the YAC128 mouse model of Huntington's disease.", "abstract": "Cell replacement therapies have yielded variable and short-lived benefits in Huntington's disease (HD) patients. This suboptimal outcome is likely due to the fact that graft survival is compromised long term because grafts are subjected to a host's microglial inflammatory response, to a lack of adequate trophic support, and possibly to cortical excitotoxicity. However, graft demise may also relate to more straightforward issues such as cell preparation methodology (solid grafts vs. cell suspension). Indeed, we recently reported that solid grafts are poorly revascularized in HD patients transplanted 9 and 12 years previously. To evaluate whether methodological issues relating to cell preparation may have an impact on graft viability, we implanted green fluorescent protein (GFP(+)) single-cell suspensions of fetal striatal neuronal cells into the striatum of YAC128 HD mice. Postmortem evaluation yielded comparable graft survival in YAC128 mice and their wild-type littermates (noncarrier) at 1 and 3 months posttransplantation. Additionally, the degrees of graft revascularization in the YAC128 and noncarrier mice were similar, with both capillaries and large-caliber vessels observable within the grafted tissue. Furthermore, GFP(+) cells interacted well with host blood vessels, indicating integration of the donor cells within the recipient brain. These observations, combined with our recent report of poor revascularization of solid grafts in the HD-transplanted patients, suggest that the success of cell transplantation can be improved by optimizing methodological aspects relating to cell preparation.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["GCisbani", "MSaint-Pierre", "FCicchetti"], "doi": "10.3727/096368913X668636"}

In group 3, approximately half of the flap was filled with barium contrast and no single pedicle was identified on day 42.\nPreexisting scar tissue and pedicle division in the pedicle site of a standard flap diminished dimensions of surviving flap when compared to control flaps. Incision-scar-pedicled flaps achieved better survival compared to excision-group flaps, particularly in the late postoperative period. The study findings showed that it may be possible to raise a flap from previously mutilated site secondary to scar formation and pedicle injury.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2013-06-14", "authors": ["Kahraman BerkhanYlmaz", "RaffiGurunluoglu", "MehmetBayrami\u00e7li"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e31827fb346"}

{"title": "A facile method to fabricate hydrogels with microchannel-like porosity for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Hydrogels are widely used as three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering scaffolds due to their tissue-like water content, as well as their tunable physical and chemical properties. Hydrogel-based scaffolds are generally associated with nanoscale porosity, whereas macroporosity is highly desirable to facilitate nutrient transfer, vascularization, cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Diverse techniques have been developed for introducing macroporosity into hydrogel-based scaffolds. However, most of these methods involve harsh fabrication conditions that are not cell friendly, result in spherical pore structure, and are not amenable for dynamic pore formation. Human tissues contain abundant microchannel-like structures, such as microvascular network and nerve bundles, yet fabricating hydrogels containing microchannel-like pore structures remains a great challenge. To overcome these limitations, here we aim to develop a facile, cell-friendly method for engineering hydrogels with microchannel-like porosity using stimuli-responsive microfibers as porogens. Microfibers with sizes ranging 150-200 \u03bcm were fabricated using a coaxial flow of alginate and calcium chloride solution. Microfibers containing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were encapsulated within a 3D gelatin hydrogel, and then exposed to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution at varying doses and duration. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed effective dissolution of alginate microfibers after EDTA treatment, leaving well-defined, interconnected microchannel structures within the 3D hydrogels. Upon release from the alginate fibers, HEK cells showed high viability and enhanced colony formation along the luminal surfaces of the microchannels. In contrast, HEK cells in non-EDTA treated control exhibited isolated cells, which remained entrapped in alginate microfibers. Together, our results showed a facile, cell-friendly process for dynamic microchannel formation within hydrogels, which may simultaneously release cells in 3D hydrogels in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. This platform may be adapted to include other cell-friendly stimuli for porogen removal, such as Matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive peptides or photodegradable gels. While we used HEK cells in this study as proof of principle, the concept described in this study may also be used for releasing clinically relevant cell types, such as smooth muscle and endothelial cells that are useful for repairing tissues involving tubular structures.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Is the renin-angiotensin system actually hypertensive?", "abstract": "The historical view of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is that of an endocrine hypertensive system that is controlled by renin and mediated via the action of angiotensin II on its type 1 receptor. Numerous new angiotensins (Ang) and receptors have been described, the majority being hypotensive and natriuretic, namely Ang-(1-7) and its receptor rMas. Renin and its precursor (pro-renin) can bind their common receptor. In addition to the production of Ang II, this receptor triggers intracellular effects. Given the control of renin production by intracellular calcium, calcium homeostasis is of particular importance. Ang-(1-12), which is not controlled by renin, is converted to several different angiotensin peptides and is a new pathway of the RAS. Local RAS enzymes produce or transform the different hyper- or hypotensive angiotensin within vessels and organs, but also in blood through circulating forms of the enzymes. In the kidney, a powerful local vascular RAS allows for the independence of renal vascularization from systemic control. Moreover, the kidney also contains an independent urinary RAS, which counterbalances the systemic RAS and coordinates proximal and distal sodium reabsorption. The systemic and local effects of renal RAS cannot be analyzed without taking into account the antagonistic effect of renalase. Our concept of RAS needs to evolve to take into account its dual potentiality (hyper- or hypotensive).", "journal": "Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2013-06-07", "authors": ["EtienneB\u00e9rard", "OlivierNiel", "AmandineRubio"], "doi": "10.1007/s00467-013-2481-0"}

Both types of cells were seeded on temperature-responsive culture dishes with PDLSCs alone, HUVECs alone and various ratios of the latter cells (1 : 1, 2 : 1, 5 : 1 and 1 : 5) to obtain confluent cell sheets. The expressions of osteo/odontogenic pathway markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), were analyzed at 3 and 7 d using RT-PCR. Further ALP protein quantification was performed at 7 and 14 d using ALP assay. The calcium nodule formation was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by alizarin red assay. Histological evaluations of three cell sheet constructs treated with different combinations (PDLSC-PDLSC-PDLSC/PDLSC-HUVEC-PDLSC/co-culture-co-culture-co-culture) were performed with hematoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescence staining. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test (p < 0.05).\nSignificantly higher ALP gene expression was observed at 3 d in 1 : 1 (PDLSC-HUVEC) (2.52 \u00b1 0.67) and 5 : 1 (4.05 \u00b1 1.07) co-culture groups compared with other groups (p < 0.05); this was consistent with ALP protein quantification. However, the expression of BSP and RUNX2 genes was higher at 7 d compared to 3 d. Significant calcium mineralization was detected as quantified by alizarin red assay at 14 d in 1 : 1 (1323.55 \u00b1 6.54 \u03bcm) and 5 : 1 (994.67 \u00b1 4.15 \u03bcm) co-cultures as compared with monoculture cell sheets (p < 0.05). Hematoxylin and eosin and CD31 immunostaining clearly exemplified the development of a layered cell sheet structure with endothelial cell islands within the constructed PDLSC-HUVEC-PDLSC and co-culture groups. Furthermore, HUVECs invaded the layered cell sheet, suggestive of rudimentary vascular network initiation.\nThis study suggests that the PDLSC-HUVEC co-culture, cell sheet, model exhibits significantly high levels of osteo/odontogenic markers with signs of initial vascular formation.

Although a number of surgical procedures have been described, closure of large sacrococcygeal defects resulting from excision of extensive HS still remains a challenge.\nHere, we present the use of triangular closure technique as a new alternative in surgical treatment of extensive HS of sacrococcygeal region.\nFor more than 4 years, triangular closure technique has been used for skin coverage of the large sacrococcygeal defects resulting from excision of the HS in 16 patients (12 men and 4 women) aged between 18 and 52. The size of the defects range from 10 to 25 cm in the greatest dimension.\nIn all patients, a successful tension-free closure of the defect was obtained. Except for 2 patients who had tip necrosis, all patients healed uneventfully. There was no patient with infection and wound dehiscence. A mean follow-up for 36 months (6 months-5 years) revealed no recurrence and an aesthetically acceptable scar formation in all patients. No patient required additional surgery.\nTriangular closure technique enables the surgeon to achieve a tension-free defect closure of remarkably large sacrococcygeal defects resulting from surgical excision of extensive HS. Using 2 well-vascularized fasciocutaneous flaps, it provides a durable coverage and soft tissue padding over sacrococcygeal and gluteal region with good cosmesis.

A preoperative MDCT of abdominal vascularization was performed in all patients.\nMDCT identified a dominant perforator with a paramuscular course in 12.4% of abdominal walls. In all cases, it was located in the midline and emerged directly from the deep inferior epigastric system. Its mean caliber was 1.9 mm. The flap was harvested based on this perforator in all these patients, and mean harvest time was 51 minutes. The characteristics of this perforator made dissection easier and reduced morbidity at the donor site.

In most cases, tissue engineering scaffolds must possess a three-dimensional interconnected porous network for tissue ingrowth and construct vascularization. Here, PBAE properties were explored and systems were selected to serve as both the pore-forming agent and the outer matrix of a scaffold that exhibits controlled pore opening upon degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a biodegradable hydrogel porogen system entrapped in a degradable hydrogel outer matrix. Scaffolds were prepared, and the degradation, compressive moduli, and porosity were analyzed. An added advantage of a degradable porogen is the potential for controlled drug release, and a model protein was released from the porogen particles to demonstrate this application. Finally, pluripotent cells seeded onto predegraded scaffolds were viable during the first 24 h of exposure, and furthermore, cell tracking confirmed the presence of cells within the pores of the scaffold.

Five patients had problems of exposed prosthesis, three required reconstruction after resection of scalp tumor and one patient presented with third degree flame burns of the scalp. All flaps survived without re-exploration, except three flaps with tip necrosis requiring secondary procedures of debridement and small Z-plasty reconstructions. The superficial temporal artery and its concomitant vein were used as recipient vessels, apart from two cases where previous surgery and flame burns excluded these choices, for which facial arteries and veins were used instead. Primary closure of the donor-site was possible in six cases; with skin grafting performed for the other three patients. All donor sites healed without complications. The ALT flap offers the advantage of customizable size, option of fascia lata as vascularized dural replacement, and minimal flap atrophy typical of muscle flaps. Indications include very large defects, defects with exposed prosthesis, or defects with bone or dural loss. Our experience lends credible support to the use of customized free ALT flaps to achieve functional and cosmetically superior result for the reconstruction of large scalp defects, especially with bone exposure.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2013-05-04", "authors": ["Pao-YuanLin", "RosMiguel", "Khong-YikChew", "Yur-RenKuo", "Johnson Chia-ShenYang"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22103"}

Here, we investigate whether decellularized liver scaffolds provide cell-friendly biocompatible three-dimensional (3-D) environment to support the proliferation and differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells. Mouse liver tissues are efficiently decellularized through portal vein perfusion. Using the reversibly immortalized mouse fetal hepatic progenitor cells (iHPCs), we are able to effectively recellularize the decellularized liver scaffolds. The perfused iHPCs survive and proliferate in the 3-D scaffolds in vitro for 2 weeks. When the recellularized scaffolds are implanted into the kidney capsule of athymic nude mice, cell survival and proliferation of the implanted scaffolds are readily detected by whole body imaging for 10 days. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is shown to significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of the implanted iHPCs. Histologic and immunochemical analyzes indicate that iHPCs are able to proliferate and differentiate to mature hepatocytes upon EGF stimulation in the scaffolds. The recellularization of the biomaterial scaffolds is accompanied with vascularization. Taken together, these results indicate that decullarized liver scaffolds effectively support the proliferation and differentiation of iHPCs, suggesting that decellularized liver matrix may be used as ideal biocompatible scaffolds for hepatocyte transplantation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In this prospective clinical study, ITGs in 30 patients with sialolithiasis-related chronic sialadenitis or an unilateral submandibular mass and 18 disease-free submandibular gland controls were quantitatively analyzed by CEUS using the contrast agent SonoVue. In addition, clinical complaints according to visual analog scales (VAS) were documented. VAS data documented significantly less complaints only in benign tumors compared with the other pathologies of the submandibular gland. In parallel, CEUS-derived ITGs revealed significantly reduced ITGs only in benign tumors (n = 5) compared to the controls (n = 18). Despite of comparably reduced wash-in velocities in malignant lesions (n = 3) statistical significance was not reached. Chronic sialadenitis (n = 18) and its sclerosing variant (K\u00fcttner tumor, n = 4) revealed comparable ITGs as controls. Tumors of the submandibular gland present with reduced functional microcirculatory networks comparing with healthy gland controls and chronically inflamed submandibular glands.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ranolazine and propranolol when administered either alone or combined prior to I/R induction in a pig model. Thirty domestic pigs were randomly assigned to five groups of six animals including (i) sham animals; (ii) untreated animals with 45-min ischemia and 1-min reperfusion; animals administered intravenously with (iii) ranolazine, or (iv) propranolol, or (v) both combined, prior to 45-min ischemia and 1-min reperfusion. The heart rate (HR), duration of monophasic action potentials (dMAP), and peak of the time derivative of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) were measured during ischemia and after 1 min of reperfusion. Structural and functional parameters of mitochondria were analyzed in tissue samples taken from the left ventricle ischemic area at the end of the experiment. I/R induced expected effects, namely accelerated HR, decreased dMAP and LV dP/dt max, and altered mitochondrial structural and functional parameters including decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reduced calcium retention capacity resulting in the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP). Ranolazine and propranolol administered either alone or combined prior to I/R significantly decreased all of these deleterious consequences.

{"title": "Numbness in the tip of the tongue and lower lip caused by thalamic hemorrhage.", "abstract": "Although patients with isolated oral syndrome or facial sensory loss following stroke of thalamic ventroposteromedial (VPM) nucleus have been reported, there have been no reports of numbness in the tip of the tongue and lower lip. Furthermore, symptoms in the tip of the tongue caused by stroke are typically characterized as gustatory sensory disturbances. A 62-year-old hypertensive man experienced an acute onset of severe numbness in the left tip of the tongue and ipsilateral lower lip. Neurological examination revealed no other abnormalities except for the aforementioned numbness. Head computed tomography showed a small hematoma in the medial part of the right thalamus, most likely within the VPM nucleus. The somatosensory impulse of the tongue is conveyed via the lingual nerve, and it reaches the contralateral medial VPM proper via the trigeminal spinal nucleus. Therefore, thalamic stroke mainly involving the medial VPM proper has the potential to elicit numbness in the tip of the tongue. A major portion of the VPM nucleus is vascularized by the inferolateral arteries. The inferolateral arteries vary greatly in the number and position of the arteries and their tributaries, and small-vessel disease in this territory can present with diverse symptoms because of this complexity. These findings indicate that central neurological involvement should not be overlooked in the case of sensory disturbance restricted to the tip of the tongue and lip.", "journal": "Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["MitsuteruShimohata", "YumikoWatanabe", "HajimeTanaka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.03.021"}
{"title": "Effects of VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful growth factor that promotes vascularization as well as osteoblastic differentiation and bone regeneration, all of which are key processes in the osseointegration of dental implants. Strategies to increase vascularization through delivery of VEGF may improve osseointegration, especially in patients with reduced bone healing potential. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of chitosan coatings on titanium to deliver VEGF and to support growth and matrix production of osteoblastic cells in vitro. Chitosan was chemically bonded to titanium coupons via silane-glutaraldehyde linker molecules and loaded with 0, 20, 50, or 100 ng of VEGF. Protein was released during a three day period with around 75% of VEGF (4.44, 11.37, and 22.10 ng/mL/cm(2) from the 20, 50, and 100 ng loaded levels, respectively) released during the first 12 h, and 90-95% of the VEGF released from the coatings by day 3. Saos-2 bone cells continued to proliferate over the 28-day period on the VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings in contrast to cells seeded on uncoated titanium, which plateaued after 14 days. Cells on uncoated titanium exhibited a peak in alkaline phosphatase expression at approximately 14 days, concomitant with the plateau in growth. While osteoblast-like cells on all chitosan coatings exhibited up to a 2-fold enhancement of the alkaline phosphatase activity and 10-fold increase in calcium deposition compared to uncoated controls, the incorporation of VEGF into the coatings did not enhance osteoblast matrix production over plain chitosan coatings throughout this study.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Evaluation of magnesium-yttrium alloy as an extraluminal tracheal stent.", "abstract": "Tracheomalacia is a relatively rare problem, but can be challenging to treat, particularly in pediatric patients. Due to the presence of mechanically deficient cartilage, the trachea is unable to resist collapse under physiologic pressures of respiration, which can lead to acute death if left untreated. However, if treated, the outcome for patients with congenital tracheomalacia is quite good because the cartilage tends to spontaneously mature over a period of 12 to 18 months. The present study investigated the potential for the use of degradable magnesium-3% yttrium alloy (W3) to serve as an extraluminal tracheal stent in a canine model. The host response to the scaffold included the formation of a thin, vascularized capsule consisting of collagenous tissue and primarily mononuclear cells. The adjacent cartilage structure was not adversely affected as observed by bronchoscopic, gross, histologic, and mechanical analysis. The W3 stents showed reproducible spatial and temporal fracture patterns, but otherwise tended to corrode quite slowly, with a mix of Ca and P rich corrosion product formed on the surface and observed focal regions of pitting. The study showed that the approach to use degradable magnesium alloys as an extraluminal tracheal stent is promising, although further development of the alloys is required to improve the resistance to stress corrosion cracking and improve the ductility.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

To prolong the function of tissue-engineered constructs after transplantation, a rapid and sufficient vascularization of engrafted tissue is essential. The in vitro formation of network structures derived from endothelial cells (ECs) in grafts before transplantation contributes to the induction of functional anastomosis in vivo. This study compared the angiogenic potential of ADSC sheets containing dissociated ECs (non-prevascular cell-sheets) and networked ECs (prevascular cell-sheets) after transplantation. For preparing the two different types of ECs-containing layered cell-sheets, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were sandwiched between two human ADSC sheets. Non-prevascular cell-sheets were obtained immediately after sandwiching without further cultivation. Prevascular cell-sheets were harvested form temperature-responsive culture dishes following re-cultivation for allowing them to form an EC network structure. In transplant experiments in the subcutaneous tissues of immune-deficient rat for 4 days, prevascular cell-sheets were observed to promote neovascularization with HUVEC-lined microvessels. In contrast, neovessels were hardly observed in non-prevascular cell-sheets. These results suggested that prefabricated EC network in layered cell-sheet was effective for making a rapid connection to the host vasculature in the early post-transplanted period.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The reconstructed fingers included the index, middle, ring, and little fingers; thumb reconstruction was not included in this study. The flap size ranged from 2.5\u00d71.8 to 5\u00d73 cm. A composite flap with a segment of tendon was applied for a complex reconstruction in 4 cases. Either superficial branch of radial nerve or dorsal branch of ulnar nerve was included in flap elevation because of its perineural vascular network contributing to the flap perfusion.

The in vivo impact of MSCs on graft oxygenation and neovascularization was assessed in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes that were subcutaneously transplanted with islets coencapsulated with AMSCs (n\u2009=\u20098) or BM-MSCs (n\u2009=\u20096).

Recipients were monitored metabolically and immunologically, and neoangiogenesis was assessed on explanted grafts. Results were compared with primates transplanted with islets encapsulated alone (n\u2009=\u20095). The cotransplantation of islets with BM-MSCs or AMSCs in diabetic rats showed significantly higher graft oxygenation than islets alone (3% and 3.6% O2 for islets\u2009+\u2009BM-MSCs or AMSCs, respectively, vs. 2.2% for islets alone). A significantly better glycated hemoglobin correction (28 weeks posttransplantation) was found for primates transplanted with islets and MSCs (7.4% and 8.1%, respectively) in comparison to islets encapsulated alone (10.9%). Greater neoangiogenesis was found in the periphery of coencapsulated islets and AMSCs in comparison to islets alone (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In conclusion, the coencapsulation of pig islets with MSCs can improve significantly the islets' survival/function in vitro.

Several miRNAs control the formation of new blood vessels either by increasing or by inhibiting angiogenesis. Here, we investigated the possible role of the miR-106b\u223c25 cluster in postnatal neovascularization and in regulation of the angiogenic properties of adult bone marrow-derived stromal cells.\nTo study the effect of miR-106b\u223c25 deletion on neovascularization, we used a miR-106b\u223c25 knockout (KO) mouse model. After inducing hindlimb ischaemia, we showed that vascularization in ischaemic mice devoid of miR-106b\u223c25 is impaired, as evident from the reduced blood flow on laser Doppler perfusion imaging. The miR-106b\u223c25 cluster was also shown here to be an essential player in the proper functioning of bone marrow-derived stromal cells through its regulation of apoptosis, matrigel tube formation capacity, cytokine secretion, and expression of the stem-cell marker Sca-1. In addition, we showed that capillary sprouting from miR-106b\u223c25 KO aortic rings is diminished.\nThese results show that the miR-106b\u223c25 cluster regulates post-ischaemic neovascularization in mice, and that it does so in part by regulating the function of angiogenic bone marrow-derived stromal cells and of endothelial cells.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2013-02-20", "authors": ["JonathanSemo", "RinatSharir", "ArnonAfek", "CamilaAvivi", "IrisBarshack", "SofiaMaysel-Auslender", "YakovKrelin", "DavidKain", "MichalEntin-Meer", "GadKeren", "JacobGeorge"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/eht041"}

Using an in vitro system, we examined the role that chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure plays in gene expression changes during the early stage of embryonic differentiation. We demonstrated that EtOH affected the cell morphology, cell cycle progression and also delayed the down-regulation of OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis demonstrated that EtOH deregulates many genes and pathways that are involved in early embryogenesis. Follow-up analyzes revealed that EtOH exposure to embryoid bodies (EBs) induced the expression of an organizer-specific gene, goosecoid (GSC), in comparison to controls. Moreover, EtOH treatment altered several important genes that are involved in embryonic structure formation, nervous system development, and placental and embryonic vascularization, which are all common processes that FASD can disrupt. Specifically, EtOH treatment let to a reduction in ALDOC, ENO2 and CDH1 expression, whereas EtOH treatment induced the expression of PTCH1, EGLN1, VEGFA and DEC2 in treated EBs. We also found that folic acid (FA) treatment was able to correct the expression of the majority of genes deregulated by EtOH exposure during early embryo development. Finally, the present study identified a gene set including GSC, which was deregulated by EtOH exposure that may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).

This newly identified artery was subsequently named the artery of Percheron (AOP). Given the estimated prevalence of the AOP in up to one third of the population and its significant proportion of all thalamic infarcts, it is necessary for physicians to be aware of this anatomic vascular variant and its clinical consequences. Although occlusion of the AOP may present similar to other arterial thalamic occlusions, it can be identified through susceptibility-weighted imaging and ruled out with conventional or magnetic resonance angiography. Occlusion of the AOP typically causes a simultaneous and symmetric infarction. Treatment efficacy is time-dependent and necessitates thrombolytics and anticoagulative medications.

However, although human progenitors expressing cardiac markers were present in the patches before implantation, none of them could be subsequently identified in the grafted tissue.

Three strategies were evaluated by changing spatiotemporal cues: (a) induction of osteogenesis prior to vasculogenesis; (b) induction of vasculogenesis prior to osteogenesis; or (c) simultaneous induction of osteogenesis and vasculogenesis. By 5 weeks of culture, bone-like tissue development was evidenced by the deposition of bone matrix proteins, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, along with the formation of vascular networks, evidenced by endothelial cell surface markers, such as CD31 and von Willebrand factor, and morphometric analysis. Most robust development of the two tissue compartments was achieved by sequential induction of osteogenesis followed by the induction of vasculogenesis. Taken together, the collected data strongly support the utility of hASCs as a single-cell source for the formation of vascularized bone tissue.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-08-21", "authors": ["CristinaCorreia", "WarrenGrayson", "RyanEton", "Jeffrey MGimble", "Rui ASousa", "Rui LReis", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1564"}
{"title": "Enhanced endothelial differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells by substrate nanotopography.", "abstract": "Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have great potential as a cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine because they are easier to obtain, have lower donor-site morbidity and are available in larger numbers than stem cells harvested using bone marrow aspiration. Until now, little has been known about how nanotopography affects the proliferation and endothelial differentiation of ADSCs. In the present study, two nanograting substrates with a period (ridge and groove) of about 250 and 500 nm, respectively, were fabricated on quartz and their effect on ADSC fate was investigated. The results showed that proliferation of ADSCs on nanograting substrates decreased while cell attachment was not significantly affected compared to a flat substrate. Endothelial differentiation of ADSCs on both flat and nanograting substrates can be induced with vascular endothelial growth factor, as shown by immunofluorescent staining. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed significantly enhanced upregulation of vWF, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin at the gene level by ADSCs on the nanograting substrates. In vitro angiogenesis assay on Matrigel showed that nanograting substrates enhanced capillary tube formation. This study highlights the beneficial influence of nanotopography on the differentiation of ADSC into endothelial cells which play an important role in vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-05-26", "authors": ["ZhilongShi", "K GNeoh", "E TKang", "Chye KhoonPoh", "WilsonWang"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1496"}
{"title": "Promotion of diabetic wound healing by collagen scaffold with collagen-binding vascular endothelial growth factor in a diabetic rat model.", "abstract": "Studies show that VEGF can promote tissue regeneration in diabetic wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a new composite biomaterial, a collagen scaffold with CBD-VEGF, for wound healing in a diabetic rat model.\nWe produced a collagen scaffold loaded with CBD-VEGF, which allowed VEGF to bind to the collagen scaffold. The diabetic rat model was constructed by injecting streptozocin (STZ) peritoneally and removing a 2 x 2.5\u2009cm thick slice of skin from the back of the animal. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: blank control (BC Group, n\u2009=\u200924), collagen scaffold loaded with PBS (PBS Group, n\u2009=\u200924), collagen scaffold loaded with NAT-VEGF (NAT-VEGF Group, n\u2009=\u200924), and collagen scaffold loaded with CBD-VEGF (CBD-VEGF Group, n\u2009=\u200924). Wounds of the BC Group were covered with gauze and those of the PBS, NAT-VEGF and CBD-VEGF Groups were grafted by corresponding collagen scaffolds, respectively. Healing rates were calculated and compared among groups. Wound tissue was evaluated by histologic analysis.\nThe CBD-VEGF group showed a higher wound healing rate, better vascularization and higher level of VEGF in the granulation tissue wound compared with NAT-VEGF and PBS groups.\nThe collagen scaffold with CBD-VEGF promoted wound healing in a diabetic rat model, which could potentially provide better therapeutic options for the treatment of diabetic wounds.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-05-10", "authors": ["QianTan", "BingChen", "XinYan", "YueLin", "ZhifengXiao", "XianglinHou", "JianwuDai"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1513"}
{"title": "Vertical bone augmentation using different osteoconductive scaffolds combined with barrier domes in the rat calvarium.", "abstract": "To compare the regenerative potential for vertical bone augmentation of various osteoconductive scaffolds when used in conjunction with barrier domes.\nFollowing exposure and perforation of the calvarium, a gold occlusive dome was filled with the tested scaffold and anchored by fixation screws. Flaps were repositioned and secured. The four treatment groups, three to five rats each, were as follows: Bio-Oss collagen (BOC), \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), collagen sponge (COL), and empty domes (C). Rats were sacrificed 8 weeks later, and specimens were prepared for histological and histomorphometric analysis. Vertical bone height and total tissue height were measured.\nThe newly regenerated bone appeared mature, highly vascularized, and with no signs of inflammation. Vertical bone height in the TCP group (mean 2.04 \u00b1 0.2 mm) was greater than all other groups (0.76 \u00b1 0.02, 1.52 \u00b1 0.18, and 1.77 \u00b1 0.61 mm for the BOC, C, and COL, respectively) but significantly only for the BOC group (p = .0145). Total tissue height was significantly higher (p < .0001) in both BOC and TCP groups (4.48 \u00b1 0.23 and 5.5 \u00b1 0.24 mm, respectively) compared with COL (3.22 \u00b1 0.11 mm) and C (2.39 \u00b1 0.3 mm) groups.\nTCP in conjunction with barrier dome resulted in greater vertical bone augmentation in the calvarium of rats.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2012-03-17", "authors": ["HadarZigdon", "DinaLewinson", "TovaBick", "Eli EMachtei"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1708-8208.2012.00452.x"}
