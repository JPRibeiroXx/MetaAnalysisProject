Without access to adequate nutrients, cells placed deep within the tissue construct will die out, leading to non-uniform tissue regeneration. Currently, there is a necessity to design nutrient conduit networks within the tissue construct to enable cells to survive in the matrix. However, the design of complex networks within a tissue construct is challenging. In this paper, we present the Lindenmayer system, an elegant fractal-based language algorithm framework, to generate conduit networks in two- and three-dimensional architecture with several degrees of complexity. The conduit network maintains a parent-child relationship between each branch of the network. Several L-system parameters have been studied-branching angle, branch length, ratio of parent to child branch diameter, etc-to simulate several architectures under a given L-system notation. We have also presented a layered manufacturing-based UV-photopolymerization process using the Texas Instruments DLP system to fabricate the branched structures.

Nanoparticles were printed under varied conditions either in the biopolymer or loaded inside cells. Cell viability, alginate viscosity, nanoparticle movement and printing resolution were measured. We now show that while nanoparticles decreased cell viability, nozzle size had no significant effect. High printing pressure decreased cell viability, but viability loss was not accentuated by nanoparticles. High nanoparticle concentrations increased alginate viscosity at higher alginate concentrations. Nanoparticle velocity in response to a magnetic field was a function of nanoparticle diameter and scaffold viscosity, which agreed with a mathematical model of nanoparticle movement. Finally, the nano-bioprinting system resolution and patterning precision were not affected by nanoparticles in the prepolymer solution.

In our first paper (Mondy et al 2009 Tissue Eng. at press), using micro-CT, we studied the possibility of using vascular tissues to produce data capable of aiding the design of vascular tree scaffolding, which would help in the reverse engineering of a complete vascular tree system including capillary bed structures. In this paper, we used STL models of large datasets of computer-aided design (CAD) data of vascular structures which contained capillary structures that mimic those in the dermal layers of rabbit skin. Using CAD software we created from 3D STL models a bio-CAD design for the development of capillary-containing vascular tree scaffolding for skin.

Among many important scaffold applications, hydrogel scaffolds have been utilized in tissue engineering as a technique to confide the desired proliferation of seeded cells in vitro and in vivo into its architecturally porous three-dimensional structures. Such fabrication techniques not only enable the reconstruction of scaffolds with accurate anatomical architectures but also enable the ability to incorporate bioactive species such as growth factors, proteins, and living cells. This paper presents a bioprinting system designed for the freeform fabrication of porous alginate scaffolds with encapsulated endothelial cells. The bioprinting fabrication system includes a multinozzle deposition system that utilizes SFF techniques and a computer-aided modeling system capable of creating heterogeneous tissue scaffolds. The manufacturing process is biologically compatible and is capable of functioning at room temperature and relatively low pressures to reduce the fluidic shear forces that could deteriorate biologically active species. The deposition system resolution is 10 microm in the three orthogonal directions XYZ and has minimum velocity of 100 microm/s.

The pH-stimuli-responsive polysaccharide chitosan was enlisted to form a freestanding hydrophilic membrane structure in microfluidic networks where pH gradients are generated at the converging interface between a slightly acidic chitosan solution and a slightly basic buffer solution. A simple and effective pumping strategy was devised to realize a stable flow interface thereby generating a stable, well-controlled and localized pH gradient. Chitosan molecules were deprotonated at the flow interface, causing gelation and solidification of a freestanding chitosan membrane from a nucleation point at the junction of two converging flow streams to an anchoring point where the two flow streams diverge to two output channels. The fabricated chitosan membranes were about 30-60 microm thick and uniform throughout the flow interface inside the microchannels. A T-shaped membrane formed by sequentially fabricating orthogonal membranes demonstrates flexibility of the assembly process. The membranes are permeable to aqueous solutions and are removed by mildly acidic solutions. Permeability tests suggested that the membrane pore size was a few nanometres, i.e., the size range of antibodies.

Recent studies have shown that the acidic calcium phosphates, brushite and monetite, are osteoconductive, osteoinductive and resorb faster in vivo than hydroxyapatite. Moreover, they can be 3D printed allowing precise host bone-implant conformation. The objectives of this study were to confirm that craniofacial screw fixation of 3D printed monetite blocks was possible and to compare the resulting vertical bone augmentation with autograft. 3D printed monolithic monetite onlay implants were fixed with osteosynthesis screws on the calvarial bone surface of New Zealand rabbits. After 8 weeks, integration between the implant and the calvarial bone surface was observed in all cases. Histomorphometry revealed that 42% of the monetite was resorbed and that the new bone formed within the implant occupied 43% of its volume, sufficient for immediate dental implant placement. Bone tissue within the autologous onlay occupied 60% of the volume. We observed that patterns of regeneration within the implants differed throughout the material and propose that this was due to the anatomy and blood supply pattern in the region. Rapid prototyped monetite being resorbable osteoconductive and osteoinductive would appear to be a promising biomaterial for many bone regeneration strategies.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-08-22", "authors": ["FalehTamimi", "JesusTorres", "UweGbureck", "EnriqueLopez-Cabarcos", "David CBassett", "Mohammad HAlkhraisat", "Jake EBarralet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.049"}

Scaffolds may elicit adverse host responses and interfere with direct cell-cell interaction, as well as assembly and alignment of cell-produced ECM. Thus, fabrication techniques for production of scaffold-free engineered tissue constructs have recently emerged. Here we report on a fully biological self-assembly approach, which we implement through a rapid prototyping bioprinting method for scaffold-free small diameter vascular reconstruction. Various vascular cell types, including smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, were aggregated into discrete units, either multicellular spheroids or cylinders of controllable diameter (300-500 microm). These were printed layer-by-layer concomitantly with agarose rods, used here as a molding template. The post-printing fusion of the discrete units resulted in single- and double-layered small diameter vascular tubes (OD ranging from 0.9 to 2.5mm). A unique aspect of the method is the ability to engineer vessels of distinct shapes and hierarchical trees that combine tubes of distinct diameters.

It is essential to understand the cell responses to process-induced mechanical disturbances because they alter cell morphology and function. We carried out analysis and quantification of the degree of cell injury induced by bioprinting process. A parametric study with different process parameters was conducted to analyze and quantify cell injury as well as to optimize the parameters for printing viable cells. A phenomenological model was developed correlating the percentage of live, apoptotic and necrotic cells to the process parameters. This study incorporates an analytical formulation to predict the cell viability through the system as a function of the maximum shear stress in the system.

Thus, here we report the development of a hybrid, nanostructured, extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking scaffold by a combination of ePCL nanofibers and self-assembled peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers. The PAs have ECM mimicking characteristics including a cell adhesive ligand (RGDS) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mediated degradable sites. Transmission electron microscope imaging verified successful PA self-assembly into nanofibers (diameters of 8-10 nm) using a solvent evaporation method. This evaporation method was then used to successfully coat PAs onto ePCL nanofibers (diameters of 300-400 nm), to develop hybrid, bioactive scaffolds. Scanning electron microscope characterization showed that the PA coatings did not interfere with the porous ePCL nanofiber network. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were seeded onto the hybrid scaffolds to evaluate their bioactivity. Significantly greater attachment and spreading of hMSCs were observed on ePCL nanofibers coated with PA-RGDS as compared to ePCL nanofibers coated with PA-S (no cell adhesive ligand) and uncoated ePCL nanofibers. Overall, this novel strategy presents a new solution to overcome the current bioactivity challenges of electrospun scaffolds and combines the unique characteristics of ePCL nanofibers and self-assembled PA nanofibers to provide an ECM mimicking environment.

The industrial potential of biofabrication technology is far beyond the traditional medically oriented tissue engineering and organ printing and, in the short term, it is essential for developing potentially highly predictive human cell- and tissue-based technologies for drug discovery, drug toxicity, environmental toxicology assays, and complex in vitro models of human development and diseases.

However, as many tissues experience cyclic physiological strains, this may provide a mechanism to enhance solute transport in vivo before vascularization of the scaffold. The hypothesis of this study was that pore cross-sectional geometry and interconnectivity are of major importance for the effectiveness of cyclic deformation-induced solute transport. Transparent elastic polyurethane scaffolds, with computer-programmed design of pore networks in the form of interconnected channels, were fabricated using a 3D printing and injection molding technique. The scaffold pores were loaded with a colored tracer for optical contrast, cyclically compressed with deformations of 10 and 15% of the original undeformed height at 1.0 Hz. Digital imaging was used to quantify the spatial distribution of the tracer concentration within the pores. Numerical simulations of a fluid-structure interaction model of deformation-induced solute transport were compared to the experimental data. The results of experiments and modeling agreed well and showed that pore interconnectivity heavily influences deformation-induced solute transport. Pore cross-sectional geometry appears to be of less relative importance in interconnected pore networks. Validated computer models of solute transport can be used to design optimal scaffold pore geometries that will enhance the convective transport of nutrients inside the scaffold and the removal of waste, thus improving the cell survivability deep inside the scaffold.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2009-05-26", "authors": ["Jorn OpDen Buijs", "DanDragomir-Daescu", "Erik LRitman"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-009-9712-3"}

{"title": "Sponge spicules as blueprints for the biofabrication of inorganic-organic composites and biomaterials.", "abstract": "While most forms of multicellular life have developed a calcium-based skeleton, a few specialized organisms complement their body plan with silica. However, of all recent animals, only sponges (phylum Porifera) are able to polymerize silica enzymatically mediated in order to generate massive siliceous skeletal elements (spicules) during a unique reaction, at ambient temperature and pressure. During this biomineralization process (i.e., biosilicification) hydrated, amorphous silica is deposited within highly specialized sponge cells, ultimately resulting in structures that range in size from micrometers to meters. Spicules lend structural stability to the sponge body, deter predators, and transmit light similar to optic fibers. This peculiar phenomenon has been comprehensively studied in recent years and in several approaches, the molecular background was explored to create tools that might be employed for novel bioinspired biotechnological and biomedical applications. Thus, it was discovered that spiculogenesis is mediated by the enzyme silicatein and starts intracellularly. The resulting silica nanoparticles fuse and subsequently form concentric lamellar layers around a central protein filament, consisting of silicatein and the scaffold protein silintaphin-1. Once the growing spicule is extruded into the extracellular space, it obtains final size and shape. Again, this process is mediated by silicatein and silintaphin-1, in combination with other molecules such as galectin and collagen. The molecular toolbox generated so far allows the fabrication of novel micro- and nanostructured composites, contributing to the economical and sustainable synthesis of biomaterials with unique characteristics. In this context, first bioinspired approaches implement recombinant silicatein and silintaphin-1 for applications in the field of biomedicine (biosilica-mediated regeneration of tooth and bone defects) or micro-optics (in vitro synthesis of light waveguides) with promising results.", "journal": "Applied microbiology and biotechnology", "date": "2009-05-12", "authors": ["Werner E GM\u00fcller", "XiaohongWang", "Fu-ZhaiCui", "Klaus PeterJochum", "WolfgangTremel", "JoachimBill", "Heinz CSchr\u00f6der", "FilipeNatalio", "UteSchlossmacher", "MatthiasWiens"], "doi": "10.1007/s00253-009-2014-8"}

It is beneficial to create standard orbits classified according to the aforementioned categories of gender, ethnicity, and age.

These methods will be used in the future to make molds for many different ages, genders, and races in order to create accurate models of the eye orbit. These can then be used to develop impact tests by incorporating eye samples into these sockets of uniform shape.

In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate flow fields within porous scaffolds used for cell growth. From these models the shear stresses acting on the scaffold fibres are calculated. The results led to the conclusion that the Darcian (k(1)) permeability constant is a good predictor for the shear stresses in scaffold systems for tissue engineering. This permeability constant is easy to calculate from the distance between and thickness of the fibres used in a 3D printed scaffold. As a consequence computational effort and specialists for CFD can be circumvented by using this permeability constant to predict the shear stresses. If the permeability constant is below a critical value, cell growth within the specific scaffold design may cause a significant increase in shear stress. Such a design should therefore be avoided when the shear stress experienced by the cells should remain in the same order of magnitude.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2009-04-11", "authors": ["PetraVossenberg", "G AHiguera", "Gvan Straten", "C Avan Blitterswijk", "A J Bvan Boxtel"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-009-0153-6"}

The modified inkjet printer may be a useful tool for creating three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models, because it offers an inexpensive and high-throughput solution to microfabrication, and because the printer can be easily manipulated to produce varying tissue attributes. We hypothesized, however, that when ink is replaced with a biologically based fluid (i.e. a 'bio-ink'), specifically a serum-free cell culture medium, printer nozzle failure can result from salt scale build-up as fluid evaporates on the printhead surface. In this study, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was used as a culture medium additive to prevent salt scaling and cell aggregation during the bioprinting process. The results showed that EDTA, at a concentration typically found in commercially available trypsin solutions (0.53 mM), prevented nozzle failure when a serum-free culture medium was printed from a nozzle at 1000 drops/s. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of EDTA appeared to mildly decrease aggregation of 4T07 cells.

A novel precision extruding deposition (PED) technique was developed to fabricate polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds. It was possible to manufacture scaffolds with a controlled pore size of 350 microm with designed structural orientations using this method. The scaffold morphology, internal micro-architecture and mechanical properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and mechanical testing, respectively. An in vitro cell-scaffold interaction study was carried out using primary fetal bovine osteoblasts. Specifically, the cell proliferation and differentiation was evaluated by Alamar Blue assay for cell metabolic activity, alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast production of calcium. An in vivo study was performed on nude mice to determine the capability of osteoblast-seeded PCL to induce osteogenesis. Each scaffold was implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and, following sacrifice, was explanted at one of a series of time intervals. The explants were then evaluated histologically for possible areas of osseointegration.

It was found that the resulting PCL nanofiber (NF) meshes had similar topological structures to that of the template stainless steel mesh. Such PCL nanofiber meshes (NF meshes) had improved the tensile strength with Young's modulus of 62.7 +/- 5.3 MPa, which is >40% higher than the modulus of 44 +/- 5.7 MPa as measured with the corresponding randomly oriented PCL nanofiber mats (RNF mat). On the other hand, the ultimate strain (87.30%) of the PCL NF meshes was distinctly lower than that of the PCL RNF mats (146.46%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mechanical properties of nanofiber meshes with tailored architectures and patterns were studied and reported. When cultured with a mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1), the electrospun PCL NF meshes gave a much higher proliferation rate as compared with the randomly oriented PCL RNF mats. More importantly, it was found that the cells grew and elongated along the fiber orientation directions, and the resulted cellular organization and distribution mimicked the topological structures of the PCL NF meshes.

{"title": "Scaffold engineering: a bridge to where?", "abstract": "A significant amount of federal research funding (over $4 billion) has gone into tissue engineering over the last 20 years. This has led to an exponential increase in research productivity as evidenced by the number of published papers referencing 'tissue engineering' and 'scaffold'. However, the number of tissue engineering products resulting from this research remains a paltry few, of which true tissue engineering products can be counted using the fingers of two hands. The fundamental question remains 'Why does such a gap exist between research and translation?'. This paper argues that such a gap exists in part due to the research paradigms followed in tissue engineering, in which a linear model is followed that assumed individual technical discovery can be bundled into model tissue engineering systems, followed by manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval. As such, most research funding follows this linear model with the vast majority of research spent on the discovery phase. This includes funding on both cell therapy and scaffold materials and engineering. It is assumed that therapy systems can readily be constructed by combining disparate technologies derived in different laboratories and that these therapies can readily achieve regulatory approval. Yet, most tissue engineering technologies fail to make it to clinical application because they simply have not been engineered for these specific applications or cannot be scaled to clinical level production. This paper argues that a different research paradigm is needed, essentially that of Pasteur's Quadrant proposed by Donald Stokes in the book of the same name. In this paradigm, research is pursued from the twin perspective of end use and the need for fundamental understanding. From this perspective, more funding emphasis should be placed on scalable manufacturing of systems that are designed for specific clinical applications that can attain regulatory approval. Funding of such scaffold/cell manufacturing technologies would not only enable greater translation of technology to clinical application, but would also enable a richer investigation of basic science issues. For example, the investigation of stem cell biology and differentiation in controlled 3D environments instead of 2D culture dishes. In this sense, a concentration of scaffold manufacturing would enable a quicker bridge across the 'Valley of Death' by providing for faster regulatory approval as stand alone products that would pave the way to combination products. At the same time, such manufacturing capabilities would broaden the scientific horizons in cell therapy.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2009-03-01", "authors": ["Scott JHollister"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/1/1/012001"}
{"title": "Mechanical and in vitro performance of apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic reinforced hydroxyapatite composite fabricated by 3D-printing.", "abstract": "In situ hydroxyapatite/apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic composite was fabricated by a three dimensional printing (3DP) technique and characterized. It was found that the as-fabricated mean green strength of the composite was 1.27 MPa which was sufficient for general handling. After varying sintering temperatures (1050-1300 degrees C) and times (1-10 h), it was found that sintering at 1300 degrees C for 3 h gave the greatest flexural modulus and strength, 34.10 GPa and 76.82 MPa respectively. This was associated with a decrease in porosity and increase in densification ability of the composite resulting from liquid phase sintering. Bioactivity tested by soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) and In Vitro toxicity studies showed that 3DP hydroxyapatite/A-W glass ceramic composite was non-toxic and bioactive. A new calcium phosphate layer was observed on the surface of the composite after soaking in SBF for only 1 day while osteoblast cells were able to attach and attain normal morphology on the surface of the composite.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

{"title": "Biofabrication of antibodies and antigens via IgG-binding domain engineered with activatable pentatyrosine pro-tag.", "abstract": "We report the assembly of seven different antibodies (and two antigens) into functional supramolecular structures that are specifically designed to facilitate integration into devices using entirely biologically based bottom-up fabrication. This is enabled by the creation of an engineered IgG-binding domain (HG3T) with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag that facilitates purification and a C-terminal enzyme-activatable pentatyrosine \"pro-tag\" that facilitates covalent coupling to the pH stimuli-responsive polysaccharide, chitosan. Because we confer pH-stimuli responsiveness to the IgG-binding domain, it can be electrodeposited or otherwise assembled into many configurations. Importantly, we demonstrate the loading of both HG3T and antibodies can be achieved in a linear fashion so that quantitative assessment of antibodies and antigens is feasible. Our demonstration formats include: conventional multiwell plates, micropatterned electrodes, and fiber networks. We believe biologically based fabrication (i.e., biofabrication) provides bottom-up hierarchical assembly of a variety of nanoscale components for applications that range from point-of-care diagnostics to smart fabrics.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2009-02-19", "authors": ["Hsuan-ChenWu", "Xiao-WenShi", "Chen-YuTsao", "Angela TLewandowski", "RohanFernandes", "Chi-WeiHung", "PhilipDeShong", "EiryKobatake", "James JValdes", "Gregory FPayne", "William EBentley"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.22238"}
{"title": "Histological evaluation of osteogenesis of 3D-printed poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds in a rabbit model.", "abstract": "Utilizing a suitable combination of lactide and glycolide in a copolymer would optimize the degradation rate of a scaffold upon implantation in situ. Moreover, 3D printing technology enables customizing the shape of the scaffold to biometric data from CT and MRI scans. A previous in vitro study has shown that novel 3D-printed poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds had good biocompatibility and mechanical properties comparable with human cancellous bone, while they could support proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. Based on the previous study, this study evaluated PLGA scaffolds for bone regeneration within a rabbit model. The scaffolds were implanted at two sites on the same animal, within the periosteum and within bi-cortical bone defects on the iliac crest. Subsequently, the efficacy of bone regeneration within the implanted scaffolds was evaluated at 4, 12 and 24 weeks post-surgery through histological analysis. In both the intra-periosteum and iliac bone defect models, the implanted scaffolds facilitated new bone tissue formation and maturation over the time course of 24 weeks, even though there was initially observed to be little tissue ingrowth within the scaffolds at 4 weeks post-surgery. Hence, the 3D-printed porous PLGA scaffolds investigated in this study displayed good biocompatibility and are osteoconductive in both the intra-periosteum and iliac bone defect models.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2009-02-12", "authors": ["ZigangGe", "XianfengTian", "Boon ChinHeng", "VictorFan", "Jin FeiYeo", "TongCao"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/4/2/021001"}
{"title": "Solute transport in cyclically deformed porous tissue scaffolds with controlled pore cross-sectional geometries.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of pore geometry on the transport rate and depth after repetitive mechanical deformation of porous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Flexible cubic imaging phantoms with pores in the shape of a circular cylinder, elliptic cylinder, and spheroid were fabricated from a biodegradable polymer blend using a combined 3D printing and injection molding technique. The specimens were immersed in fluid and loaded with a solution of a radiopaque solute. The solute distribution was quantified by recording 20 microm pixel-resolution images in an X-ray microimaging scanner at selected time points after intervals of dynamic straining with a mean strain of 8.6+/-1.6% at 1.0 Hz. The results show that application of cyclic strain significantly increases the rate and depth of solute transport, as compared to diffusive transport alone, for all pore shapes. In addition, pore shape, pore size, and the orientation of the pore cross-sectional asymmetry with respect to the direction of strain greatly influence solute transport. Thus, pore geometry can be tailored to increase transport rates and depths in cyclically deformed scaffolds, which is of utmost importance when thick, metabolically functional tissues are to be engineered.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in calcium phosphate scaffolds by inorganic copper ion release.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis in a tissue-engineered device may be induced by incorporating growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), genetically modified cells, and=or vascular cells. It represents an important process during the formation and repair of tissue and is essential for nourishment and supply of reparative and immunological cells. Inorganic angiogenic factors, such as copper ions, are therefore of interest in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering due to their low cost, higher stability, and potentially greater safety compared with recombinant proteins or genetic engineering approaches. The purpose of this study was to compare tissue responses to 3D printed macroporous bioceramic scaffolds implanted in mice that had been loaded with either VEGF or copper sulfate. These factors were spatially localized at the end of a single macropore some 7 mm from the surface of the scaffold. Controls without angiogenic factors exhibited only poor tissue growth within the blocks; in contrast, low doses of copper sulfate led to the formation of microvessels oriented along the macropore axis. Further, wound tissue ingrowth was particularly sensitive to the quantity of copper sulfate and was enhanced at specific concentrations or in combination with VEGF. The potential to accelerate and guide angiogenesis and wound healing by copper ion release without the expense of inductive protein(s) is highly attractive in the area of tissue-engineered bone and offers significant future potential in the field of regenerative biomaterials.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Organ printing: tissue spheroids as building blocks.", "abstract": "Organ printing can be defined as layer-by-layer additive robotic biofabrication of three-dimensional functional living macrotissues and organ constructs using tissue spheroids as building blocks. The microtissues and tissue spheroids are living materials with certain measurable, evolving and potentially controllable composition, material and biological properties. Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with \"built-in\" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. Thus, organ printing is a new emerging enabling technology paradigm which represents a developmental biology-inspired alternative to classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2009-01-30", "authors": ["VladimirMironov", "Richard PVisconti", "VladimirKasyanov", "GaborForgacs", "Christopher JDrake", "Roger RMarkwald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.084"}
{"title": "Fabrication of freeform bone-filling calcium phosphate ceramics by gypsum 3D printing method.", "abstract": "Transformation of gypsum model fabricated by three-dimensional printing (3DP) into hydroxyapatite (HA) by treating in ammonium phosphate solution is possible. However, 3DP powder supplied by the manufacturer contains unknown additives which may be questionable for biomaterials. Accordingly, pure plaster of Paris (POP) powder was used for fabrication in the present study. For accurate fabrication, reduction of supplied binder ink to 80% of standard amount for 3DP powder supplied by the manufacturer was found to be the optimal condition for POP fabrication. Transformation from POP to HA was done by immersing into 1 mol/L ammonium phosphate solution. However, preheating of fabricated POP specimen at 200 degrees C for 30 min to change from calcium sulfate dihydrate into calcium sulfate hemihydrate could accelerate the transformation into HA effectively. To increase compressive strength, HA transformed specimen was sintering at 1150 degrees C for 3 h. The compressive strength increased four times comparing with as transformed HA specimen. However, crystal structure was transformed to beta-TCP due to the chemical reaction between the transformed HA and remained phosphate from ammonium phosphate solution at the sintering temperature. A sophisticated application of the present 3DP method to fabricate the freeform bioceramic for osseous defect was attempted, and jaw bone defect filling biomaterial of beta-TCP and scaffold with macroporous structures could be fabricated. Present 3DP method has possibility to fabricate freeform bioceramic for osseous defect or scaffold.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue constructs by centrifugal casting in a decellularized natural scaffold with laser-machined micropores.", "abstract": "Centrifugal casting allows rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue constructs by suspending living cells in an in situ cross-linkable hydrogel. We hypothesize that introduction of laser-machined micropores into a decellularized natural scaffold will facilitate cell seeding by centrifugal casting and increase hydrogel retention, without compromising the biomechanical properties of the scaffold. Micropores with diameters of 50, 100, and 200 mum were machined at different linear densities in decellularized small intestine submucosa (SIS) planar sheets and tubular SIS scaffolds using an argon laser. The ultimate stress and ultimate strain values for SIS sheets with laser-machined micropores with diameter 50 mum and distance between holes as low as 714 mum were not significantly different from unmachined control SIS specimens. Centrifugal casting of GFP-labeled cells suspended in an in situ cross-linkable hyaluronan-based hydrogel resulted in scaffold recellularization with a high density of viable cells inside the laser-machined micropores. Perfusion tests demonstrated the retention of the cells encapsulated within the HA hydrogel in the microholes. Thus, an SIS scaffold with appropriately sized microholes can be loaded with hydrogel encapsulated cells by centrifugal casting to give a mechanically robust construct that retains the cell-seeded hydrogel, permitting rapid biofabrication of tubular tissue construct in a \"bioreactor-free\" fashion.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

{"title": "Proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblasts within 3D printed poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid scaffolds.", "abstract": "Bone repair and regeneration can be enhanced through implantation of biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds, which serve primarily as osteoconductive moieties. In this study, the mechanical properties and microenviroment of 3D printed poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds are examined. Additionally, the proliferation and differentiation of human fetal osteoblasts are evaluated after 3 weeks of in vitro culture on the scaffolds. The results showed that the PLGA scaffolds examined had mechanical properties similar to that of trabecular bone, but was still much weaker compared to cortical bone. In addition to general porosity, the PLGA scaffolds also had micropores within macropore walls. Cultured human osteoblasts could proliferate upon seeding on the PLGA scaffolds. Alkaline phosphatase activity and osteonectin expression of the osteoblasts cultured on the PLGA scaffolds remained stable over three weeks, whilst expression of collagen type I and osteopontin decreased. The alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts cultured on PLGA scaffolds is comparable with that from two commercially-available scaffolds - OPLA and collagen scaffolds (Becton-Dickinson (BD) Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Hence, the results suggested that the PLGA scaffolds examined are conducive for promoting osteogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2008-09-02", "authors": ["NoneZigang Ge", "NoneLishan Wang", "NoneBoon Chin Heng", "Xian-FengTian", "NoneKai Lu", "VictorTai Weng Fan", "NoneJin Fei Yeo", "NoneTong Cao", "EuniceTan"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328208094301"}
