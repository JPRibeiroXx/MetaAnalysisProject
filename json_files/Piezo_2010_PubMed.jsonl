{"title": "The Microscopic Origin of Residual Stress for Flat Self-Actuating Piezoelectric Cantilevers.", "abstract": "In this study, flat piezoelectric microcantilevers were fabricated under low-stress Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) film conditions. They were analyzed using the Raman spectrum and wafer curvature methods. Based on the residual stress analysis, we found that a thickness of 1 \u03bcm was critical, since stress relaxation starts to occur at greater thicknesses, due to surface roughening. The (111) preferred orientation started to decrease when the film thickness was greater than 1 \u03bcm. The d33 value was closely related to the stress relaxation associated with the preferred orientation changes. We examined the harmonic response at different PZT cantilever lengths and obtained a 9.4-\u03bcm tip displacement at 3 Vp-p at 1 kHz. These analyses can provide a platform for the reliable operation of piezoelectric microdevices, potentially nanodevice when one needs to have simultaneous control of the residual stress and the piezoelectric properties.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2011-12-01", "authors": ["Jeong HoonLee", "Kyo SeonHwang", "Tae SongKim"], "doi": "10.1007/s11671-010-9810-z\n10.1063/1.2890142\n10.1088/0022-3727/42/8/085301\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.06.007\n10.1063/1.2715542\n10.1063/1.2010606\n10.1063/1.353862\n10.1063/1.1426271\n10.1063/1.3330897\n10.1063/1.370638\n10.1063/1.1308061\n10.1063/1.2986448\n10.1016/S1359-6454(02)00254-9\n10.1016/S0040-6090(00)01563-7\n10.1063/1.1558228\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.04.017\n10.1063/1.1427403\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.01.024"}

Fine-grained PMN-PT ceramics exhibited comparable dielectric and piezoelectric properties to their coarse-grained counterpart in the low frequency range (<10 MHz), but offered greater mechanical strength and improved property stability with decreasing thickness, corresponding to higher operating frequencies (>40 MHz). For PMN-PT single crystals, however, the dielectric and electromechanical properties degraded with decreasing thickness, while ternary Pb(In(1/2)Nb(1/2))O(3)-Pb(Mg(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-PbTiO(3) (PIN-PMN-PT) exhibited minimal size dependent behavior. The origin of property degradation of PMN-PT crystals was further studied by investigating the dielectric permittivity at high temperatures, and domain observations using optical polarized light microscopy.

However, protein extracts from most body fluid or biopsy samples are available in very small volumes and are often unsuitable for large-scale antibody microarray studies. To demonstrate the potential for protein analysis with as little as a few nanoliters of sample, we have developed a new technology called NanoProbeArrays based on piezoelectric liquid dispensing for non-contact printing and probing of antibody arrays. Instead of flooding the protein sample on the antibody microarray surface, as in conventional microarray screening, a piezoelectric inkjet printer is used to dispense nanoliters of fluorescently labeled proteins over the antibody spots on the array. The ability of NanoProbeArrays to precisely identify and reliably distinguish between test proteins from different sources, without any loss of sensitivity and specificity as compared with conventional antibody microarrays, is illustrated here. The utility of NanoProbeArrays for biomarker identification in a complex biological sample was tested by detecting the cytokine interleukin-4 in serum.

However, new powerful electrical circuits were developed that are capable of operating TSM quartz crystal sensors in fluids which enabled this method to be introduced into electrochemical and biological applications. These applications include the detection of virus capsids, bacteria, mammalian cells, the interaction of DNA and RNA with complementary strands, specific recognition of protein ligands by immobilized receptors, and last but not least the study of complete immunosensors. Piezoelectric quartz transducers allow a label-free identification of molecules; they are more than mass sensors since the biosensor response is also influenced by the surface charge of adsorbed proteins, interfacial phenomena, surface roughness and viscoelastic properties of the adhered biomaterial. These new characteristics have recently been used to investigate cell, liposome, and protein adhesion onto surfaces, thus permitting the rapid determination of morphological cell changes as a response to pharmacological substances, and changes in the water content of biopolymers avoiding of time-consuming methods. We validated an alternative quantitative acoustical engineering for cell adhesion process monitored by the TSM.

We also investigate the influence of disorder. In the clean limit we obtain the divergence of the piezoelectric tensor at the critical point. The effect of a small amount of disorder is to translate the critical point in the temperature-electric field phase diagram. For large values of the disorder, the paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition becomes diffuse but a maximum of the piezoelectric tensor is still obtained even though the divergence of the piezoelectric response is lost. These results are in agreement with experimental observations for the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Mg(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3)-PbTiO(3). We use a Ginzburg-Landau model which explicitly includes the coupling of the polarization to the strain, the electrostatic interaction between polarizations, and a quenched random compressional stress field generated by point defects.

{"title": "Electrical polarization and orbital magnetization: the modern theories.", "abstract": "Macroscopic polarization P and magnetization M are the most fundamental concepts in any phenomenological description of condensed media. They are intensive vector quantities that intuitively carry the meaning of dipole per unit volume. But for many years both P and the orbital term in M evaded even a precise microscopic definition, and severely challenged quantum-mechanical calculations. If one reasons in terms of a finite sample, the electric (magnetic) dipole is affected in an extensive way by charges (currents) at the sample boundary, due to the presence of the unbounded position operator in the dipole definitions. Therefore P and the orbital term in M--phenomenologically known as bulk properties--apparently behave as surface properties; only spin magnetization is problemless. The field has undergone a genuine revolution since the early 1990s. Contrary to a widespread incorrect belief, P has nothing to do with the periodic charge distribution of the polarized crystal: the former is essentially a property of the phase of the electronic wavefunction, while the latter is a property of its modulus. Analogously, the orbital term in M has nothing to do with the periodic current distribution in the magnetized crystal. The modern theory of polarization, based on a Berry phase, started in the early 1990s and is now implemented in most first-principle electronic structure codes. The analogous theory for orbital magnetization started in 2005 and is partly work in progress. In the electrical case, calculations have concerned various phenomena (ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and lattice dynamics) in several materials, and are in spectacular agreement with experiments; they have provided thorough understanding of the behaviour of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. In the magnetic case the very first calculations are appearing at the time of writing (2010). Here I review both theories on a uniform ground in a density functional theory (DFT) framework, pointing out analogies and differences. Both theories are deeply rooted in geometrical concepts, elucidated in this work. The main formulae for crystalline systems express P and M in terms of Brillouin-zone integrals, discretized for numerical implementation. I also provide the corresponding formulae for disordered systems in a single k-point supercell framework. In the case of P the single-point formula has been widely used in the Car-Parrinello community to evaluate IR spectra.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

This paper will relate the study of adatom dynamics at the \u03b1-Sn/Ge(111) and \u03b1-Sn/Si(111) surfaces, discussing in detail the methods we used for such kinds of time-resolved measurements. The microscope tip was used to record the tunnelling current on top of an oscillating Sn adatom, keeping the feedback loop turned off. The dynamics of the adatoms is detected as telegraph noise present in the tunnelling versus time curves.

We used an adaptive optics system to determine how the temporal location of the correction affects the response. The system consists of a Shack-Hartmann sensor sampling at 20 Hz and a 37-actuator piezoelectric deformable mirror. An extra sensing channel allows for an independent measure of the accommodation level of the eye. The accommodation response of four subjects was measured during a +/- 0.5 D step change in stimulus vergence whilst aberrations were corrected at various time locations. We found that continued correction of aberrations after the step change decreased the gain for disaccommodation, but increased the gain for accommodation. These results could be explained based on the initial lag of accommodation to the stimulus and changes in the level of aberrations before and after the stimulus step change.

In this study the use of a multiple barrier approach incorporating coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the removal of intracellular and extracellular cyanobacterial toxins from two naturally occurring blooms in South Australia. Also investigated was the impact of these treatments on the UF flux. In this multibarrier approach, coagulation was used to remove the cells and thus the intracellular toxin while PAC was used for extracellular toxin adsorption and finally the UF was used for floc, PAC and cell removal. Cyanobacterial cells were completely removed using the UF membrane alone and when used in conjunction with coagulation. Extracellular toxins were removed to varying degrees by PAC addition.

This technique affords the resolution of the magnetization processes in soft magnetic materials, in terms of reversible deformation of pinned domain walls, domain wall displacements and spin rotation, for which characteristic parameters such as the alloy initial permeability and the relaxation frequencies, indicating the dispersion of each process, can be defined. Additionally, these parameters can be correlated with chemical composition variation, size effects and induced anisotropies, leading to a more physical insight for the understanding of the frequency dependent magnetic response of amorphous alloys, which is of prime interest for the development of novel applications in the field of telecommunication and sensing technologies.

Self-polymerisation of dopamine is used as a powerful approach for applying multifunctional coatings onto the surface of a gold electrode. The polydopamine film is used not only as the immobilisation platform, but also as a cross-linker reagent for the immobilisation of the anti-SRB antibody. The polydopamine film is loaded with a high density of anti-SRB antibodies linked to the substrate to obtain high response signals. The formation and fabrication of the biosensor and the quantification of antibody anchoring are monitored, and SRB detection is performed by either quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After modeling the impedance Nyquist plots of the SRB/anti-SRB/polydopamine/gold electrode for increasing concentrations of SRB, the electron transfer resistance (R(ct)) is used as a measure of immunocomplex binding. The R(ct) is correlated with the concentration of bacterial cells in the range of 1.8\u00d710(2) to 1.8\u00d710(6) CFU mL(-1); the detection limit is 50 CFU mL(-1).

{"title": "Progress in developing a thermal method for measuring the output power of medical ultrasound transducers that exploits the pyroelectric effect.", "abstract": "Progress in developing a new measurement method for ultrasound output power is described. It is a thermal-based technique with the acoustic power generated by a transducer being absorbed within a specially developed polyurethane rubber material, whose high absorption coefficient ensures energy deposition within a few mm of the ultrasonic wave entering the material. The rate of change of temperature at the absorber surface is monitored using the pyroelectric voltage generated from electrodes disposed either side of a 60 mm diameter, 0.061 mm thick membrane of the piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) bonded to the absorber. The change in the pyroelectric output voltage generated by the sensor when the transducer is switched ON and OFF is proportional to the delivered ultrasound power. The sensitivity of the device is defined as the magnitude of these switch voltages to a unit input stimulus of power (watt). Three important aspects of the performance of the pyroelectric sensor have been studied. Firstly, measurements have revealed that the temperature dependent sensitivity increases over the range from approximately 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C at a rate of +1.6% \u00b0C(-1). Studies point to the key role that the properties of both the absorbing backing layer and pvdf membrane play in controlling the sensor response. Secondly, the high sensitivity of the technique has been demonstrated using an NPL Pulsed Checksource, a 3.5 MHz focused transducer delivering a nominal acoustic power level of 4 mW. Finally, proof-of-concept of a new type of acoustic sensor responding to time-averaged intensity has been demonstrated, through fabrication of an absorber-backed hydrophone of nominal active element diameter 0.4 mm. A preliminary study using such a device to resolve the spatial distribution of acoustic intensity within plane-piston and focused 3.5 MHz acoustic fields has been completed.

However, here, we observe from the electrical response that significant motional anharmonicity is introduced in the presence of attached analyte. Experiments were conducted with streptavidin-coated polystyrene microbeads of various sizes attached to a quartz crystal resonator via specific and nonspecific molecular tethers in liquid. Quantitative analysis reveals that the deviation of odd Fourier harmonics of the response caused by introduction of microbeads as a function of oscillation amplitude presents a unique signature of the molecular tether. Hence, the described anharmonic detection technique (ADT) based on this function allows screening of biomolecules and provides an additional level of selectivity in receptor-based detection that is often associated with nonspecific interactions.

Vasculature is visualized by virtue of its high hemoglobin content compared to surrounding breast parenchyma. The technique is compatible with dynamic contrast-enhanced studies.\nPhotoacoustic sonic waves were stimulated in the breast with a pulsed laser operating at 800 nm and a mean exposure of 20 mJ/pulse over an area of approximately 20 cm2. These waves were subsequently detected by a hemispherical array of piezoelectric transducers, the temporal signals from which were filtered and backprojected to form three-dimensional images with nearly uniform k-space sampling.\nThree-dimensional vascular images of a human volunteer demonstrated a clear visualization of vascular anatomy with submillimeter spatial resolution to a maximum depth of 40 mm using a 24 s image acquisition protocol. Spatial resolution was nearly isotropic and approached 250 microm over a 64 x 64 x 50 mm field of view.\nThe authors have successfully visualized submillimeter breast vasculature to a depth of 40 mm using an illumination intensity that is 32 times less than the maximum permissible exposure according to the American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers. Clearly, the authors can achieve greater penetration depth in the breast by increasing the intensity and the cross-sectional area of the illumination beam.

{"title": "Quantitative modeling of the transduction of electromagnetic acoustic transducers operating on ferromagnetic media.", "abstract": "The noncontact nature of electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) offers a series of advantages over traditional piezoelectric transducers, but these features are counter-balanced by their relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and their strong dependence on material properties such as electric conductivity, magnetic permeability, and magnetostriction. The implication is that full exploitation of EMATs needs detailed modeling of their operation. A finite element model, accounting for the main transduction mechanisms, has been developed to allow the optimization of the transducers. Magnetostriction is included and described through an analogy with piezoelectricity. The model is used to predict the performance of a simple EMAT: a single current-carrying wire, parallel to a bias magnetic field generating shear horizontal waves in a nickel plate close to it. The results are validated against experiments. The model is able to successfully predict the wave amplitude dependence on significant parameters: the static bias field, the driving current amplitude, and the excitation frequency. The comparison does not employ any arbitrary adjustable parameter; for the first time an absolute validation of a magnetostrictive EMAT model has been achieved. The results are satisfactory: the discrepancy between the numerical predictions and the measured values of wave amplitude per unit current is less than 20% over a 200 kHz frequency range. The study has also shown that magnetostrictive EMAT sensitivity is not only a function of the magnetostrictive properties, because the magnetic permeability also plays a significant role in the transduction mechanism, partly counterbalancing the magnetostrictive effects.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2010-12-16", "authors": ["RemoRibichini", "FredericCegla", "Peter BNagy", "PeterCawley"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1754"}

It uses an inherent impedance property of transducers and thus does not need an external electric matching circuit or extra acoustic matching section. The input electrical equivalent circuit includes a radiation component and a dielectric capacitor. The radiation component consists of a radiation resistance and a radiation reactance. The total reactance is the sum of the radiation reactance and the dielectric capacitive reactance. This reactance becomes zero at two frequencies where the impedance is real. The transducer size can be properly chosen so that the impedance at one of the zero-crossing frequencies is close to 50 \u03a9, the output impedance of signal generators. At this off-resonant operating frequency, the reflection coefficient of the transducer is minimized without using any matching circuit. Other than the size, the impedance can also be fine tuned by adjusting the thickness of material that bonds the transducer plate to the substrates. The acoustic impedance of the substrate and that of the bonding material can also be used as design elements in the transducer structure to achieve better transducer matching.

A number of technologies for this procedure have evolved lately, such as the most commonly utilized piezo-assisted ICSI technique (P-ICSI).

A completely different and mercury-free injection technology, called the rotationally oscillating drill (Ros-Drill) (RD-ICSI), was recently developed. It uses microprocessor-controlled rotational oscillations of a spiked micropipette after the pipette deforms the membrane to a certain tension level. Inappropriate selection of this initiation instant typically results in cell damage, which ultimately leads to unsuccessful ICSI. During earlier manual clinical tests of Ros-Drill, the technicians' expertise determined this instant in an ad hoc fashion.

{"title": "Nanocomposites with increased energy density through high aspect ratio PZT nanowires.", "abstract": "High energy storage plays an important role in the modern electric industry. Herein, we investigated the role of filler aspect ratio in nanocomposites for energy storage. Nanocomposites were synthesized using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with two different aspect ratio (nanowires, nanorods) fillers at various volume fractions dispersed in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix. The permittivity constants of composites containing nanowires (NWs) were higher than those with nanorods (NRs) at the same inclusion volume fraction. It was also indicated that the high frequency loss tangent of samples with PZT nanowires was smaller than for those with nanorods, demonstrating the high electrical energy storage efficiency of the PZT NW nanocomposite. The high aspect ratio PZT NWs showed a 77.8% increase in energy density over the lower aspect ratio PZT NRs, under an electric field of 15 kV mm(-1) and 50% volume fraction. The breakdown strength was found to decrease with the increasing volume fraction of PZT NWs, but to only change slightly from a volume fraction of around 20%-50%. The maximum calculated energy density of nanocomposites is as high as 1.158 J cm(-3) at 50% PZT NWs in PVDF. Since the breakdown strength is lower compared to a PVDF copolymer such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-tertrifluoroethylene-terchlorotrifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TreEE-CTFE) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) P(VDF-HFP), the energy density of the nanocomposite could be significantly increased through the use of PZT NWs and a polymer with greater breakdown strength.

{"title": "Technologies for continuous glucose monitoring: current problems and future promises.", "abstract": "Devices for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are currently a major focus of research in the area of diabetes management. It is envisioned that such devices will have the ability to alert a diabetes patient (or the parent or medical care giver of a diabetes patient) of impending hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events and thereby enable the patient to avoid extreme hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic excursions as well as minimize deviations outside the normal glucose range, thus preventing both life-threatening events and the debilitating complications associated with diabetes. It is anticipated that CGM devices will utilize constant feedback of analytical information from a glucose sensor to activate an insulin delivery pump, thereby ultimately realizing the concept of an artificial pancreas. Depending on whether the CGM device penetrates/breaks the skin and/or the sample is measured extracorporeally, these devices can be categorized as totally invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive. In addition, CGM devices are further classified according to the transduction mechanisms used for glucose sensing (i.e., electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric). However, at present, most of these technologies are plagued by a variety of issues that affect their accuracy and long-term performance. This article presents a critical comparison of existing CGM technologies, highlighting critical issues of device accuracy, foreign body response, calibration, and miniaturization.

The model is a prototype of a device which converts ambient acoustical energy to electrical energy with the use of piezoelectric devices. The paper then proposes an enhancement of the energy harvesting process using a nonlinear processing of the output voltage of piezoelectric actuators, and suggests that this improves the energy conversion and reduces the sensitivity to frequency drifts. A theoretical discussion is given for the electrical power that can be expected making use of various models. This and supporting experimental results suggest that a nonlinear optimization approach allows a gain of up to 10 in harvested energy and a doubling of the bandwidth.

{"title": "Properties of photocured epoxy resin materials for application in piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer matching layers.", "abstract": "This paper describes the acoustic properties of a range of epoxy resins prepared by photocuring that are suitable for application in piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer matching layers. Materials, based on blends of diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol diglycidyl ether, are described. Furthermore, in order to vary the elastic character of the base resin, samples containing polymer microspheres or barium sulfate particles are also described. The acoustic properties of the materials are determined by a liquid coupled through transmission methodology, capable of determining the velocity and attenuation of longitudinal and shear waves propagating in an isotropic layer. Measured acoustic properties are reported which demonstrate materials with specific acoustic impedance varying in the range 0.88-6.25 MRayls. In the samples comprising blends of resin types, a linear variation in the acoustic velocities and density was observed. In the barium sulfate filled samples, acoustic impedance showed an approximately linear variation with composition, reflecting the dominance of the density variation. While such variations can be predicted by simple mixing laws, relaxation and scattering effects influence the attenuation in both the blended and filled resins. These phenomena are discussed with reference to dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry of the samples.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["AlexandreTrog\u00e9", "Richard LO'Leary", "GordonHayward", "Richard APethrick", "Anthony JMullholland"], "doi": "10.1121/1.3483734"}
{"title": "Nonlinear propagation acoustics of dual-frequency wide-band excitation pulses in a focused ultrasound system.", "abstract": "In this article, acoustic propagation effects of dual-frequency wide-band excitation pulses in a focused ultrasound system are demonstrated in vitro. A designed and manufactured dual-frequency band annular array capable of transmitting 0.9/7.5 MHz center frequency wide-band pulses was used for this purpose. The dual-frequency band annular array, has been designed using a bi-layer piezo-electric stack. Water tank measurements demonstrate the function of the array by activating the low- and high-frequency layers individually and simultaneously. The results show that the array works as intended. Activating the low- and high-frequency layers individually, results in less than -50 dB signal level from the high- and low-frequency layers respectively. Activating both layers simultaneously, produce a well defined dual-frequency pulse. The presence of the low-frequency pulse leads to compression, expansion, and a time delay of the high-frequency pulse. There is a phase shift between the low- and high-frequency pulse as it propagates from the array to the focus. This makes the latter described effects also dependent on the array configuration. By varying the low-frequency pressure, a shift of up to 0.5 MHz in center frequency of a 8.0 MHz transmitted high-frequency pulse is observed at the array focus. The results demonstrate the high propagation complexity of dual-frequency pulses.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2010-11-30", "authors": ["Svein-ErikM\u00e5s\u00f8y", "\u00d8yvindStandal", "Jochen MDeibele", "Sven PeterN\u00e4sholm", "Bj\u00f8rnAngelsen", "Tonni FJohansen", "Thor AndreasTangen", "RuneHansen"], "doi": "10.1121/1.3488308"}

{"title": "Ultrasonic array of thick film transducers for biological tissue characterization.", "abstract": "The initial motivation for this work was to accomplish an easy way to manufacture different geometries of ultrasonic transducers and arrays using a PZT powder, combined with a standard process to have repetitive series of them. The piezoelectric thick film was obtained using a PZT paste and applying it by screen printing on an alumina substrate. Then, the film was drying and sintered with a temperature-time profile determined by the paste characteristics. Each transducer is composed by three layers, one by PZT and two acting as electrodes. The active element of the paste is a PZT powder which is dispersed in a commercial vehicle to obtain rheological properties suitable for use the screen printing process. The connection between PZT particles is improved by adding a lead borosilicate frit glass that also helps to attach the film to the substrate due to the relatively low temperature of sintered that has been used in this process. The PZT film has low density that is generated by internal porosity, so its acoustic impedance is lower than for a bulk ceramic transducer and so is well adapted to testing human tissues. At the same time the thick film technology is well suited to make medium size transducers and also arrays performed with tiny ultrasonic transducers.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "A new apparatus for analysis of viscoelastic fluids by ultrasound radiation force.", "abstract": "The acoustic radiation force has been used as the method to examine the physical properties of materials in several areas. Vibro-acoustography is an acoustic radiation force technique that is being used to perform analysis of mechanical properties of materials. In this application a focused acoustic modulated force excites target which vibrates at the frequency of modulation. The emitted sound is characteristic of the medium mechanical impedance and it is measured using a dedicated hydrophone. In this paper, we propose a modification of the vibro-acoustography (VAG) technique and apply a technique called vibro-acustomagnetography (VAMG) by replacing the hydrophone by a magnetic sensor with high sensitivity. In this case, the modulated acoustic radiation will be applied on a magnetized target immersed in the fluid under study. With this procedure, static and dynamic displacement of the magnetic target (ball) will be measured when acoustically excited. In this study, we used a magnetoresistive sensor with resolution of about nT for mounting the transducer to detect displacement of the magnetic target. The vibration of the target was induced by a non-contact force, using an ultrasonic beam modulated by two concentric beams generated by confocal piezoelectric elements with equal area and common focus to 7 cm. The target used was a magnetic sphere of NdFeB with a radius of 2.36 mm. The apparatus was evaluated through of measurements in water and oil.

{"title": "Impact of movement on cardiorespiratory coordination in conscious rats.", "abstract": "In this study we assessed the impact of movement on the interaction between the heart rhythm and respiration in rats while they were conscious and freely moving. In eight male adult Sprague-Dawley (SD, n=4) and Hooded Wistar (HW, n=4) rats, we recorded respiratory rate using whole-body plethysmography with a piezoelectric sensor attached to simultaneously monitor body movement. Heart rate was recorded using a radio-telemetry transmitter. For the assessment of cardiorespiratory coordination, we analysed the phase-locking between heart rate and respiration, estimating the instantaneous phases using Hilbert transform. For statistical analysis, the piezoelectric signal was dichotomized into low-intensity (LIm) and high-intensity (HIm) movement. The R-R intervals, respiratory intervals and cardiorespiratory coordination between LIm and HIm of each rat were assessed with Student's t-test. A significant decrease in the mean values for respiratory interval (0.34 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 0.23 \u00b1 0.1 s, p < 0.01 in HW rats) and R-R interval (0.19 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 s, p < 0.001 in SD rats) was observed during HIm. The phase-locking between the cardiac and respiratory signals also decreased significantly during HIm (overall coordination during LIm vs. HIm: 89.3 \u00b1 3.3% vs. 8.7 \u00b1 1.7%, p < 0.001).

Ten common carotid arteries of hypertensive men were evaluated. D was calculated by using B-mode ultrasonic imaging and specialized software designed with Artificial Neural Networks. Instantaneous arterial pressure of all subjects was measured by piezoelectric tonometry. Arterial wall properties were evaluated using a linear autoregressive with exogenous input model. The new method, which determinates the arterial diameter, was compared respect to a specialized and previously validated method. Results showed no significant differences in all parameters derived of D (Bland & Altman test) and no differences in all the wall arterial mechanic indexes (p>0.05).

{"title": "Histotripsy erosion of model urinary calculi.", "abstract": "Histotripsy is a pulsed focused ultrasound technology in which initiation and control of acoustic cavitation allow for precise mechanical fractionation of tissues. The present study examines the feasibility of using histotripsy for erosion of urinary calculi.\nHistotripsy treatment was delivered from a 750-kHz transducer in the form of 5-cycle acoustic pulses at a 1-kHz pulse repetition frequency. Model stones were sonicated for 5 minutes at peak negative pressures (p-) of 10, 15, 19, 22, and 24-MPa. Resulting fragment sizes and comminution rates were assessed and compared with those achieved with a piezoelectric lithotripter (Wolf Piezolith 3000) operated at 2-Hz pulse repetition frequency and power level 17 (p-\u2009= 14-MPa).\nHistotripsy eroded the surface of stones producing fine (< 100 \u03bcm) particulate debris in contrast to the progressive and incomplete subdivision of stones achieved with piezoelectric lithotripsy. The histotripsy erosion rate increased with increasing peak negative pressure from 10 to 19 MPa and then saturated, yielding an average rate of 87.9 \u00b1 12.8 mg/min at maximum treatment intensity. Piezoelectric lithotripsy achieved an average treatment rate of 110.7 \u00b1 27.4 mg/min.\nHistotripsy comminution of urinary calculi is a surface erosion phenomenon that is mechanistically distinct from conventional shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), producing only fine debris as opposed to coarse fragments. These characteristics suggest that histotripsy offers a potential adjunct to traditional SWL procedures, and synergistic interplay of the two modalities may lead to possible increases in both rate and degree of stone fragmentation.", "journal": "Journal of endourology", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["Alexander PDuryea", "Timothy LHall", "Adam DMaxwell", "ZhenXu", "Charles ACain", "William WRoberts"], "doi": "10.1089/end.2010.0407"}

A cementless femoral component was instrumented with accelerometers and a piezoelectric (PZT) patch. Data was obtained during implant impaction into replicate femurs. Acceleration measurements were obtained and signal processing techniques were applied. Metrics were analyzed from PZT excitation data. The two most correlative indices are the frequency of the anti-resonance in the 10.5 to 12 kHz band and the peak magnitude in the 9 to 11 kHz band. Both demonstrate good convergence as the prosthesis is inserted. Impact test data revealed the sum of the acceleration divided by the sum of the impact force demonstrates good convergence with implant insertion. This pattern of convergence indicates these two indices may demonstrate the ability to accurately predict optimal implant seating. This methodology is promising and has the potential to enable intraoperative determination of maximal femoral component seating and provide the surgeon valuable information to potentially prevent intraoperative fractures.", "journal": "Surgical technology international", "date": "2010-11-18", "authors": ["R MichaelMeneghini", "MikeGuthrie", "Hunter DMoore", "DeenaAbou-Trabi", "PhillipCornwell", "Aaron GRosenberg"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Shear wave velocity imaging using transient electrode perturbation: phantom and ex vivo validation.", "abstract": "This paper presents a new shear wave velocity imaging technique to monitor radio-frequency and microwave ablation procedures, coined electrode vibration elastography. A piezoelectric actuator attached to an ablation needle is transiently vibrated to generate shear waves that are tracked at high frame rates. The time-to-peak algorithm is used to reconstruct the shear wave velocity and thereby the shear modulus variations. The feasibility of electrode vibration elastography is demonstrated using finite element models and ultrasound simulations, tissue-mimicking phantoms simulating fully (phantom 1) and partially ablated (phantom 2) regions, and an ex vivo bovine liver ablation experiment. In phantom experiments, good boundary delineation was observed. Shear wave velocity estimates were within 7% of mechanical measurements in phantom 1 and within 17% in phantom 2. Good boundary delineation was also demonstrated in the ex vivo experiment. The shear wave velocity estimates inside the ablated region were higher than mechanical testing estimates, but estimates in the untreated tissue were within 20% of mechanical measurements. A comparison of electrode vibration elastography and electrode displacement elastography showed the complementary information that they can provide. Electrode vibration elastography shows promise as an imaging modality that provides ablation boundary delineation and quantitative information during ablation procedures.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2010-11-16", "authors": ["Ryan JDeWall", "TomyVarghese", "Ernest LMadsen"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2010.2091412"}

{"title": "Simulation of the effects of cavitation and anatomy in the shock path of model lithotripters.", "abstract": "We report on recent efforts to develop predictive models for the pressure and other flow variables in the focal region of shock wave lithotripters. Baseline simulations of three representative lithotripters (electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric) compare favorably with in vitro experiments (in a water bath). We proceed to model and investigate how shock focusing is altered by the presence of material interfaces associated with different types of tissue encountered along the shock path, and by the presence of cavitation bubbles that are excited by tensile pressures associated with the focused shock wave. We use human anatomical data, but simplify the description by assuming that the tissue behaves as a fluid, and by assuming cylindrical symmetry along the shock path. Scattering by material interfaces is significant, and regions of high pressure amplitudes (both compressive and tensile) are generated almost 4 cm postfocus. Bubble dynamics generate secondary shocks whose strength depends on the density of bubbles and the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). At sufficiently large densities, the bubbles also attenuate the shock. Together with experimental evidence, the simulations suggest that high PRF may be counterproductive for stone comminution. Finally, we discuss how the lithotripter simulations can be used as input to more detailed physical models that attempt to characterize the mechanisms by which collapsing cavitation models erode stones, and by which shock waves and bubbles may damage tissue.", "journal": "Urological research", "date": "2010-11-11", "authors": ["JeffKrimmel", "TimColonius", "MichelTanguay"], "doi": "10.1007/s00240-010-0332-z"}

Adults of all species could be detected when crawling or scraping. The smallest insects in the study, first-fourth-instar C. lectularius nymphs, could not be detected easily when crawling, but could be detected when scraping. Sound and vibration sensors detected brief, 3-10-ms impulses from all tested species, often grouped in distinctive trains (bursts), typical of impulses in previous acoustic detection experiments. To consider the potential for targeting or focusing detection on particular species of interest, indicators were developed to assess the likelihood of detection of C. lectularius. Statistically significant differences were found between C. lectularius and other species in distributions of three measured variables: infrared signal durations, sound impulse-burst durations, and sound pressure levels (energy) of impulses that best matched an averaged spectrum (profile) of scraping behavior.

Using fabricated microcantilevers, the real time changes in resonant frequency upon hybridization were measured by utilizing different probe and target sets. The results revealed that the microcantilevers experienced a resonant frequency upshift during the hybridization with complementary DNAs if a dimer structure was present between DNA probes.

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices have shown promise in allowing samples to be manipulated, although designing complex fluid operations involves using multiple electrode transducers. We now demonstrate a simple interface between a piezoelectric SAW device and a disposable microfluidic chip, patterned with phononic structures to control the acoustic wave propagation. The surface wave is coupled from the piezoelectric substrate into the disposable chip where it interacts with the phononic lattice. By implementing both a phononic filter and an acoustic waveguide, we illustrate the potential of the technique by demonstrating microcentrifugation for particle and cell concentration in microlitre droplets. We show for the first time that the interaction of the fluid within this metamaterial phononic lattice is dependent upon the frequency of the acoustic wave, providing a route to programme complex fluidic functions into a microchip (in much the same way, by analogy, that a holographic element would change the phase of a light wave in optical tweezers).

The aim of the work was to increase the sensitivity of the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. The polyelectrolytes used to build the multilayers were poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) alternately adsorbed from 150mM NaCl. The multilayer build up is linear and the internal structure of the PAH/PSS multilayer is compact and rigid as observed by low relative water content (20-25%) and high layer refractive index (n\u223c1.5) after the formation of five bilayers. Incorporation of IgG within the PAH/PSS multilayer did not give rise to overcharging and did not affect the linear build up. ELISpot test on PAH/PSS multilayer modified polystyrene wells showed that the cytokine response was significantly smaller than on the regular PVDF backed polystyrene wells. This may be due to the compact and rigid nature of the PAH/PSS multilayer, which does not allow formation of the kind of three dimensional support needed to achieve bioactive IgG binding to the surface.

To address these limitations, a piezoelectric floating-mass transducer (PFMT) has recently been developed. This paper presents the results of a comparative study of these two types of vibration transducer developed for IMEHDs. The differential electromagnetic floating-mass transducer (DFMT) and the PFMT were implanted in two different sets of three cadaveric human temporal bones. The resulting stapes displacements were measured and compared on the basis of the ASTM standard for describing the output characteristics of IMEHDs. The experimental results show that the PFMT can produce significantly higher equivalent sound pressure levels above 3\u00a0kHz, due to the flat response of the PFMT, than can the DFMT.

Sensors on several stent struts could give information about the heterogeneity of healing across the stent.\nA piezoelectric microcantilever was insulated with parylene and demonstrated as an endothelialization detector for incorporation within an active coronary stent. After initial characterization, endothelial cells were plated onto the cantilever surface. After they attached to the surface, they caused an increase in mass, and thus a decrease in the resonant frequencies of the cantilever. This shift was then detected electrically with an LCR meter. The self-sensing, self-actuating cantilever does not require an external, optical detection system, thus allowing for implanted applications.\nA cell density of 1300 cells/mm2 on the cantilever surface is detected.\nWe have developed a self-actuating, self-sensing device for detecting the presence of endothelial cells on a surface. The device is biocompatible and functions reliably in ionic liquids, making it appropriate for implantable applications. This sensor can be placed along the struts of a coronary stent to detect when the struts have been covered with a layer of endothelial cells and are no longer available surfaces for clot formation.

Preliminary evaluation of the actuator for an IMEHD was conducted using a temporal bone model. Initial results from one temporal bone study indicated that the actuator was small enough to be implanted within the middle ear cavity, and sufficient stapes displacement can be generated for patients with mild to moderate hearing losses, especially at higher frequency range, by the actuator suspended onto the stapes. There was an insignificant mass-loading effect on normal sound transmission (<3 dB) when the actuator was attached to the stapes and switched off. Improved vibration performance is predicted by more firm attachment. The actuator power consumption and its generated equivalent sound pressure level are also discussed. In conclusion, the actuator has advantages of small size, lightweight, and micropower consumption for potential use as IMHEDs.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2010-11-03", "authors": ["ZhigangWang", "RobertMills", "HongyanLuo", "XiaolinZheng", "WenshengHou", "LijunWang", "Stuart IBrown", "AlfredCuschieri"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2010.2090150"}

To evaluate the effects of metal thickness, mass loading caused by bioreaction, and different viscous fluid loading, the sensing region is further divided into three layers: piezoelectric substrate, metal layer, and fluid layer. In contrast to the conventional study, which is focused on the change of phase velocity, this model can evaluate the insertion loss and phase shifts under different sensing conditions. It can be shown that the integration of the COM model can provide guidelines for designing the bio-sensing device such as choosing the proper number of IDT, the width of the overlap, and the thickness of the metal layer. Furthermore, the generalized model can be utilized to evaluate the optimal thickness of the metal layer to achieve the maximum sensitivity.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2010-11-03", "authors": ["Meng-ShiunTsai", "Jie-TingJeng"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1721"}

However, mesh fixation remains a matter of discussion. This study was designed to compare noninvasive fibrin-glue attachment with tack fixation of meshes developed primarily for intra-abdominal use. It was hypothesized that particular mesh structures would substantially influence detachment force.\nFor initial evaluation, specimens of laminated polypropylene/polydioxanone meshes were anchored to porcine abdominal walls by either helical titanium tacks or absorbable tacks in vitro. A universal tensile-testing machine was used to measure tangential detachment forces (TF). For subsequent experiments of glue fixation, polypropylene/polydioxanone mesh and 4 additional meshes with diverse particular mesh structure, ie, polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh, a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh, a polyester mesh bonded with a resorbable collagen, and a macroporous condensed PTFE mesh were evaluated.\nTF tests revealed that fibrin-glue attachment was not substantially different from that achieved with absorbable tacks (median TF 7.8 Newton [N], range 1.3 to 15.8 N), but only when certain open porous meshes (polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh: median 6.2 N, range 3.4 to 10.3 N; titanium-coated polypropylene mesh: median 5.2 N, range 2.1 to 11.7 N) were used.

The propagation behaviour of Love waves in a functionally graded piezoelectric material (FGPM) is investigated in this article. It involves a thin FGPM layer bonded perfectly to an elastic substrate. The inhomogeneous FGPM heterostructure has been stratified along the depth direction, hence each state can be considered as homogeneous and the ordinary differential equation method is applied. The obtained solutions are used to study the effect of an exponential gradient applied to physical properties. Such numerical approach allows applying different gradient variation for mechanical and electrical properties. For this case, the obtained results reveal opposite effects. The dispersive curves and phase velocities of the Love wave propagation in the layered piezoelectric film are obtained for electrical open and short cases on the free surface, respectively. The effect of gradient coefficients on coupled electromechanical factor, on the stress fields, the electrical potential and the mechanical displacement are discussed, respectively.

There is a pathological healing in which the fundamental healing phenomenon is deviated from the normal. There are three variable parameters responsible for the pathological evolution of a scar: the cellular population, the fundamental matrix and the fibers. The healing evolution can be deviated to an intense maturation with an \"old\", atrophic scar, or to an incomplete maturation and the result is a hypertrophic or a keloid scar. For the hypertrophic scars, the excision and the skin graft lead to good results and the relapses are rare; the keloid relapse is always at the border between the graft and the wound edge, or between the two skin grafts.

The carbohydrate microarray is prepared by piezo printing of thiol-terminated sugars onto a maleimide functionalized glass slide. The hyperspectral ToF-SIMS imaging data are analyzed by multivariate curve resolution (MCR) to discern secondary ions from regions of the array containing saccharide, linker, salts from the printing buffer, and the background linker chemistry. Analysis of secondary ions from the linker common to all of the sugar molecules employed reveals a relatively uniform distribution of the sugars within the spots formed from solutions with saccharide concentration of 0.4 mM and less, whereas a doughnut shape is often formed at higher-concentration solutions. A detailed analysis of individual spots reveals that in the larger spots the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) salts are heterogeneously distributed, apparently resulting in saccharide concentrated at the rim of the spots. A model of spot formation from the evaporating sessile drop is proposed to explain these observations.

{"title": "Degradation studies of transparent conductive electrodes on electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride) for uric acid measurements.", "abstract": "Biochemical analysis of physiological fluids using, for example, lab-on-a-chip devices requires accurate mixing of two or more fluids. This mixing can be assisted by acoustic microagitation using a piezoelectric material, such as the \u03b2-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (\u03b2-PVDF). If the analysis is performed using optical absorption spectroscopy and \u03b2-PVDF is located in the optical path, the material and its conductive electrodes must be transparent. Moreover, if, to improve the transmission of the ultrasonic waves to the fluids, the piezoelectric transducer is placed inside the fluidic structures, its degradation must be assessed.

A compact endoscope catheter was fabricated by using a tubular piezoelectric actuator with quartered electrodes in combination with a resonant fiber cantilever. A cantilever weight was attached to the fiber cantilever to reduce the resonance frequency down to 63 Hz, well in the desirable range for Fourier-domain OCT. The resonant-cantilever scanner was driven at semi-resonance frequencies that were well out of the resonance peak but within a range of partial resonance. This driving strategy has been found to minimize the phase difference between the two scan axes for a better scan stability against environmental perturbations as well as for a driving simplicity. By driving the two axes at slightly different frequencies, a low-order Lissajous pattern has been obtained for a 2D area scan. 3D OCT images have been successfully acquired in an acquisition time of 1.56 seconds for a tomogram volume of 2.2 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.1 mm(3).

Large-scale nanofabrication methods have been restricted in accessibility due to their complexity and cost. Likewise, bottom-up synthesis of nanowires has been limited in methods to assemble these structures at precisely defined locations. Nanomaterials such as PbZr(x)Ti(1-x)O(3) (PZT) nanowires (NWs)--which may be useful for nonvolatile memory storage (FeRAM), nanoactuation, and nanoscale power generation--are difficult to synthesize without suffering from polycrystallinity or poor stoichiometric control. Here, we report a novel fabrication method which requires only low-resolution photolithography and electrochemical etching to generate ultrasmooth NWs over wafer scales. These nanostructures are subsequently used as patterning templates to generate PZT nanowires with the highest reported piezoelectric performance (d(eff) \u223c 145 pm/V).

We further demonstrate that while the presence of the shell is required to capture the electron polarization effects that control the clamped ion part of the piezoelectric constant, the major shortcoming of the classical potentials is a significant underprediction of the clamped ion term as compared to previous ab initio results.

Educational courses discuss clinical ultrasound and biopsy techniques but not ultrasound physics and instrumentation.\nTo review modern ultrasound physics and instrumentation to help pathologists understand the basis of modern ultrasound.\nA review of recent literature and textbooks was performed.\nUltrasound physics and instrumentation are the foundations of clinical ultrasound. The key physical principle is the piezoelectric effect. When stimulated by an electric current, certain crystals vibrate and produce ultrasound. A hand-held transducer converts electricity into ultrasound, transmits it into tissue, and listens for reflected ultrasound to return. The returning echoes are converted into electrical signals and used to create a 2-dimensional gray-scale image. Scanning at a high frequency improves axial resolution but has low tissue penetration. Electronic focusing moves the long-axis focus to depth of the object of interest and improves lateral resolution. The short-axis focus in 1-dimensional transducers is fixed, which results in poor elevational resolution away from the focal zone. Using multiple foci improves lateral resolution but degrades temporal resolution. The sonographer can adjust the dynamic range to change contrast and bring out subtle masses. Contrast resolution is limited by processing speed, monitor resolution, and gray-scale perception of the human eye. Ultrasound is an evolving field. New technologies include miniaturization, spatial compound imaging, tissue harmonics, and multidimensional transducers.

This study investigates the performance of ferroelectret transducers in the generation and reception of ultrasonic waves in air. As previous studies have noted, the piezoelectric coupling coefficients of these foams depend on the number, size, and distribution of charged voids in the microstructure. The present work studies the influence of these parameters both theoretically and experimentally. First, a three-dimensional model is employed to explain the variation of piezoelectric coupling coefficients, elastic stiffness, and dielectric permittivity as a function of void fraction based on void-scale physics and void geometry. Laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurements of the effective d(33) coefficient of a specially fabricated prototype transmitting transducer are then shown which clearly indicate that the charged voids in the ferroelectret material are randomly distributed in the plane of the foam. The frequency-dependent dynamic d(33) coefficient is then reported from 50 to 500 kHz for different excitation voltages and shown to be largely insensitive to drive voltage.

Impact of A-site and B-site dopants on the electromechanical properties of KNN ceramics are distinguished in view of transition temperatures. It is shown that the addition of most A-site and B-site dopants reduces the transition temperatures and improves the piezoactivity at room temperature. This is attributed to the shift of polymorphic transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase in the vicinity of room temperature.

Furthermore, these <001>-oriented crystals exhibit low mechanical quality Q and coercive fields, restricting their usage in high-power applications. In this survey, recent developments on binary and ternary perovskite relaxor-PT crystal systems are reviewed with respect to their temperature usage range. General trends of dielectric and piezoelectric properties of relaxor-PT crystal systems are discussed in relation to their respective T(C)/T(RT).

{"title": "Dynamic characterization of human breast cancer cells using a piezoresistive microcantilever.", "abstract": "In this paper, frequency response (dynamic compression and recovery) is suggested as a new physical marker to differentiate between breast cancer cells (MCF7) and normal cells (MCF10A). A single cell is placed on the laminated piezoelectric actuator and a piezoresistive microcantilever is placed on the upper surface of the cell at a specified preload displacement (or an equivalent force). The piezoelectric actuator excites the single cell in a sinusoidal fashion and its dynamic deformation is then evaluated from the displacement converted by measuring the voltage output through a piezoresistor in the microcantilever. The microcantilever has a flat contact surface with no sharp tip, making it possible to measure the overall properties of the cell rather than the local properties. These results indicate that the MCF7 cells are more deformable in quasi-static conditions compared with MCF10A cells, consistent with known characteristics. Under conditions of high frequency of over 50 Hz at a 1 \u03bcm preload displacement, 1 Hz at a 2 \u03bcm preload displacement, and all frequency ranges tested at a 3 \u03bcm preload displacement, MCF7 cells showed smaller deformation than MCF10A cells. MCF7 cells have higher absorption than MCF10A cells such that MCF7 cells appear to have higher deformability according to increasing frequency. Moreover, larger preload and higher frequencies are shown to enhance the differences in cell deformability between the MCF7 cells and MCF10A cells, which can be used as a physical marker for differentiating between MCF10A cells and MCF7 cells, even for high-speed screening devices.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["SangjoShim", "Man GeunKim", "KyoungwooJo", "Yong SeokKang", "BoreumLee", "SungYang", "Sang-MoShin", "Jong-HyunLee"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4002180"}
{"title": "Probing model tumor interfacial properties using piezoelectric cantilevers.", "abstract": "Invasive malignant breast cancers are typically branchy and benign breast tumors are typically smooth. It is of interest to characterize tumor branchiness (roughness) to differentiate invasive malignant breast cancer from noninvasive ones. In this study, we examined the shear modulus (G) to elastic modulus (E) ratio, G/E, as a quantity to describe model tumor interfacial roughness using a piezoelectric cantilever capable of measuring both tissue elastic modulus and tissue shear modulus. The piezoelectric cantilever used had two lead zirconate titanate layers to facilitate all-electrical elastic (shear) modulus measurements using one single device. We constructed model tissues with tumors by embedding one-dimensional (1D) corrugated inclusions and three-dimensional (3D) spiky-ball inclusions made of modeling clay in gelatin. We showed that for smooth inclusions, G/E was 0.3 regardless of the shear direction. In contrast, for a 1D corrugated rough inclusion G/E was 0.3 only when the shear was parallel to corrugation and G/E increased with an increasing angle between the shear direction and the corrugation. When the shear was perpendicular to corrugation, G/E became >0.7. For 3D isotropic spiky-ball inclusions we showed that the G/E depended on the degree of the roughness. Using the ratio s/r of the spike length (s) to the overall inclusion radius (r) as a roughness parameter, we showed that for inclusions with s/r larger than or equal to 0.28, the G/E ratio over the inclusions was larger than 0.7 whereas for inclusions with s/r less than 0.28, the G/E decreased with decreasing s/r to around 0.3 at s/r=0.

Modeling has been applied to rectangular and cylindrical elements. In each case, the exact equations of the displacements along the three coordinate axes and the corresponding electric impedance are calculated. The general resonance conditions are stated for these two geometries. It is shown that, contrary to the 1-D models, a unique equation describes lateral and thickness vibrations, or radial and thickness vibrations. These properties enable us to analytically calculate the frequency spectrum of rectangular elements, thick disks, or cylinders and also thick rings or hollow cylinders versus the width to thickness ratio. It is then very easy to determine the corresponding dispersion diagram related to each geometry sample. These resonance conditions are similar to those deduced from the 1-D model described in the IEEE standard but are more general and necessitate no cancelling out assumptions. In addition, contrary to 1-D models, the wave velocities and the permittivity are independent of the element geometry (parallelepiped or cylindrical). The wave velocities are equal to those stated for the wave propagation in infinite medium and measured with pulse-echo techniques.

However, MPB has been studied merely in ferroelectric systems, not in another large class of ferroic systems, the ferromagnets. In this Letter, we report the existence of an MPB in a ferromagnetic system TbCo2-DyCo2. Such a magnetic MPB involves a first-order magnetoelastic transition, at which both magnetization direction and crystal structure change simultaneously. The MPB composition demonstrates a 3-6 times larger \"figure of merit\" of magnetostrictive response compared with that of the off-MPB compositions. The finding of MPB in ferromagnets may help to discover novel high-performance magnetostrictive and even magnetoelectric materials.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2010-09-28", "authors": ["SenYang", "HuixinBao", "ChaoZhou", "YuWang", "XiaobingRen", "YoshitakaMatsushita", "YoshioKatsuya", "MasahikoTanaka", "KeisukeKobayashi", "XiaopingSong", "JianrongGao"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.197201"}
{"title": "Alginic acid-based macromolecular chemiluminescent probe for universal protein assay on a solid-phase membrane.", "abstract": "A novel chemiluminescent (CL) technique for the rapid determination of proteins on a membrane is described. The method utilizes an interaction between luminol-labeled alginic acid macromolecule and proteins. The synthesis of the macromolecular probe consists of the oxidation of alginic acid with NaIO(4), the introduction of luminol through imine formation as a CL tag, and the reduction of the conjugate with NaBH(4) to obtain the stable probe. The analytical protocol consists of adsorbing proteins on a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane, incubating the membrane for 30 min with the probe solution in the presence of boric acid and a surfactant, two short washing steps in order to remove an excess of the probe, and detection of CL intensity with hemin, tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide and H(2)O(2). This proposed CL assay for proteins can be finished within 1 h, and indicates the detection limit of 15-250 ng of proteins on the membrane. The CL signals in the calibration curves for some proteins such as albumin show proportional intensities against the amounts of the proteins less than ca. 125 ng, though there is a logarithmic relationship between the CL signals and the protein amounts larger than ca. 125 ng. However, some other proteins indicate the proportional CL intensities against the increasing amounts in wider range up to 500 ng of the proteins. The synthesised alginic acid-based probe indicates specific selectivity towards proteins, and should be used as a CL probe for the universal detection of various proteins on a solid-phase membrane even in the presence of DNA and RNA.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2010-09-25", "authors": ["TomaszKrawczyk", "MidoriKondo", "Md GolamAzam", "HuanZhang", "TakayukiShibata", "MasaakiKai"], "doi": "10.1039/c0an00282h"}

The crystal of 1o\u00b7FN with the size of 1-5 mm in length exhibits reversible bending motion upon alternate irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. The reversible bending could be repeated over 250 times. In situ X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the deformation of the crystal is due to the elongation of the b-axis of the unit cell, which corresponds to the long axis of the plate crystal, induced by the shape change of component diarylethene molecules upon photocyclization. The bending motion was observed even at 4.7 K, and dynamic measurement of the bending proved that the anisotropic expansion of the crystal takes place in the microsecond time scale at the low temperature. Molecular crystal cantilevers made of 1o\u00b7FN can lift metal balls, the weight of which is 200-600 times heavier than the weight of the crystal, upon UV irradiation.

{"title": "Characterization of a double probe for local pulse wave velocity assessment.", "abstract": "Local pulse-wave velocity (PWV) is an accurate indicator of the degree of arteriosclerosis (stiffness) in an artery, providing a direct characterization of the properties of its wall. Devices currently available for local PWV measurement are mainly based on ultrasound systems and have not yet been generalized to clinical practice since they require high technical expertise and most of them are limited in precision, due to the lack of reliable signal processing methods. The present work describes a new type of probe, based on a double-headed piezoelectric (PZ) sensor. The principle of PWV measurement involves determination of the pulse transit time between the signals acquired simultaneously by both PZs, placed 23 mm apart. The double probe (DP) characterization is accomplished in three main studies, carried out in a dedicated test bench system, capable of reproducing a range of clinically relevant properties of the cardiovascular system. The first study refers to determination of the impulse response (IR) for each PZ sensor, whereas the second one explores the existence of crosstalk between both transducers. In the last one, DP time resolution is inferred from a set of three different algorithms based on (a) the maximum of cross-correlation function, (b) the maximum amplitude detection and (c) the zero-crossing point identification. These values were compared with those obtained by the reference method, which consists of the simultaneous acquisition of pressure waves by means of two pressure sensors. The new probe demonstrates good performance on the test bench system and results show that the signals do not exhibit crosstalk. A good agreement was also verified between the PWV obtained from the DP signals (19.55 \u00b1 2.02\u2009 ms(-1)) and the PWV determined using the reference method (19.26 \u00b1 0.04\u2009 ms(-1)).

{"title": "Production efficiency of micellar casein concentrate using polymeric spiral-wound microfiltration membranes.", "abstract": "Most current research has focused on using ceramic microfiltration (MF) membranes for micellar casein concentrate production, but little research has focused on the use of polymeric spiral-wound (SW) MF membranes. A method for the production of a serum protein (SP)-reduced micellar casein concentrate using SW MF was compared with a ceramic MF membrane. Pasteurized (79\u00b0C, 18s) skim milk (1,100 kg) was microfiltered at 50\u00b0C [about 3 \u00d7 concentration] using a 0.3-\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride spiral-wound membrane, bleed-and-feed, 3-stage process, using 2 diafiltration stages, where the retentate was diluted 1:2 with reverse osmosis water. Skim milk, permeate, and retentate were analyzed for SP content, and the reduction of SP from skim milk was determined. Theoretically, 68% of the SP content of skim milk can be removed using a single-stage 3\u00d7 MF. If 2 subsequent water diafiltration stages are used, an additional 22% and 7% of the SP can be removed, respectively, giving a total SP removal of 97%. Removal of SP greater than 95% has been achieved using a 0.1-\u03bcm pore size ceramic uniform transmembrane pressure (UTP) MF membrane after a 3-stage MF with diafiltration process. One stage of MF plus 2 stages of diafiltration of 50\u00b0C skim milk using a polyvinylidene fluoride polymeric SW 0.3-\u03bcm membrane yielded a total SP reduction of only 70.3% (stages 1, 2, and 3: 38.6, 20.8, and 10.9%, respectively). The SP removal rate for the polymeric SW MF membrane was lower in all 3 stages of processing (stages 1, 2, and 3: 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03 kg/m(2) per hour, respectively) than that of the comparable ceramic UTP MF membrane (stages 1, 2, and 3: 0.30, 0.11, and 0.06 kg/m(2) per hour, respectively), indicating that SW MF is less efficient at removing SP from 50\u00b0C skim milk than the ceramic UTP system. To estimate the number of steps required for the SW system to reach 95% SP removal, the third-stage SP removal rate (27.4% of the starting material SP content) was used to extrapolate that an additional 5 water diafiltration stages would be necessary, for a total of 8 stages, to remove 95% of the SP from skim milk. The 8-plus stages necessary to remove >95% SP for the SW MF membrane would create more permeate and a lengthier process than required with ceramic membranes.", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "date": "2010-09-22", "authors": ["S LBeckman", "JZulewska", "MNewbold", "D MBarbano"], "doi": "10.3168/jds.2010-3261"}

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the PAHs, highly toxic, whose concentration correlates well with the total PAHs contents in environmental samples; its detection by immunosensors has been rarely described because of its low molecular weight and poor solubility in water.

We found relevant to set up immunosensors based on a direct or indirect competitive format. BaP was detected by PM-IRRAS with both immunosensor formats with similar sensitivity, ca. 5 \u03bcM. Flow-injection piezoelectric transduction in the indirect competitive format set up led to a slightly better sensitivity than that reached by PM-IRRAS.

A regulated cavitation generator has been developed in an in vitro configuration of standing wave field. This system implements the regulation of the cavitation level during sonication by modulating the applied acoustic intensity with a feedback loop based on acoustic measurements. The experimental setup consists of a plane piezoelectric transducer for sonication (continuous wave, frequency 445 kHz) and a hydrophone pointing to the sonicated medium. The cavitation level is quantified every 5 ms from a spectral analysis of the acoustic signal. The results show that the regulation device generates reproducible mean cavitation levels with a standard deviation lower than 1.6% in the applied intensity range (from 0.12 to 3.44 W/cm(2)), while this standard deviation can reach 76% without regulation.

It is suggested that a combination of both compositional and novel structural engineering approaches will be required in order to realize viable lead-free alternatives to current lead-based materials for piezoelectric actuator applications.", "journal": "Science and technology of advanced materials", "date": "2010-09-10", "authors": ["Serhiy OLeontsev", "Richard EEitel"], "doi": "10.1088/1468-6996/11/4/044302\n10.1016/S1359-835X(98)00137-7\n10.1007/s10832-005-0956-5\n10.1143/JPSJ.8.615\n10.1143/JJAP.35.5104\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01450.x\n10.1038/nature03028\n10.1007/s10832-007-9056-z\n10.1143/JJAP.47.3787\n10.1080/10408430490490905\n10.1063/1.1957130\n10.1063/1.365983\n10.1080/00150190802408531\n10.1063/1.371120\n10.1103/PhysRev.71.890\n10.1121/1.1908324\n10.1143/JJAP.45.L30\n10.1143/JJAP.45.7405\n10.1143/JJAP.47.8468\n10.1143/JJAP.46.7035\n10.1143/JJAP.46.L97\n10.1063/1.1732613\n10.1143/JJAP.40.5703\n10.1143/JJAP.44.5040\n10.1007/s10832-007-9146-y\n10.1143/JJAP.46.1081\n10.1107/S0108768101020845\n10.1080/00150199508018512\n10.1080/00150198808223232\n10.1080/00150197408238042\n10.1143/JJAP.47.3829\n10.1143/JJAP.30.2236\n10.1016/j.matlet.2003.08.034\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.08.007\n10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2007.11.003\n10.1016/S0955-2219(02)00027-4\n10.1016/j.mseb.2006.02.070\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.09.038\n10.1002/pssa.2211570234\n10.1143/JJAP.38.5564\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.02.016\n10.1143/JJAP.45.4493\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/10/042\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02469.x\n10.1063/1.2903498\n10.1143/JJAP.45.5138\n10.1143/JJAP.42.7401\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.336\n10.1143/JJAP.44.4350\n10.1002/pssa.200510034\n10.1038/nature03142\n10.1103/PhysRev.82.727\n10.1103/PhysRev.93.672\n10.1109/58.842064\n10.1063/1.354934\n10.1063/1.120290\n10.1063/1.2472524\n10.1143/JJAP.46.7084\n10.1143/JJAP.47.7702\n10.1143/JJAP.48.07GA05\n10.1107/S0365110X51001112\n10.1107/S0567739476000983\n10.1107/S056773947800056X\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1959.tb12971.x\n10.1103/PhysRev.96.581\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2004.11.022\n10.1016/j.mseb.2006.03.039\n10.1143/JJAP.43.7159\n10.1143/JJAP.44.6618\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00229.x\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1967.tb15121.x\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1962.tb11127.x\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2004.05.007\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00743.x\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.00960.x\n10.1016/j.matlet.2004.07.057\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01893.x\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.02.110\n10.1080/00150190600732512\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.06.034\n10.1063/1.2382348\n10.1063/1.2897033\n10.1063/1.2908960\n10.1063/1.2794400\n10.1063/1.2753390\n10.1016/0038-1098(69)90597-3\n10.1063/1.2731312\n10.1126/science.1080615\n10.1143/JJAP.40.5999\n10.1143/JJAP.41.2099\n10.1063/1.3112564\n10.1063/1.2969773\n10.1080/00150190701508860\n10.1063/1.371953\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03313.x\n10.1063/1.3271682\n10.1063/1.2956410\n10.1063/1.2123387\n10.1063/1.3182725\n10.1007/s10832-007-9136-0\n10.1063/1.1813636\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.12.069\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02871.x\n10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1223\n10.1007/s10854-009-9899-y\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.287\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.02935.x"}

High performance size-exclusion chromatography and multiangle laser light scattering results suggested the presence of a small fraction of IgG aggregates with average radius >100 nm under anion-exchange flowthrough conditions. The small filtration area presented by the 0.35 mL membrane volume Mustang Q coin limited the membrane throughput due to fouling from the aggregates at higher antibody loading. Data in this report indicated that a 0.2 \u03bcm hybrid polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene fluoride membrane in-line prefilter with a minimum filtration area of 20 sq cm alleviated the Mustang Q coin fouling. The combined cake filtration and intermediate blocking model was proposed as the most likely membrane pore blocking mechanism. Increasing the filtration area in the in-line prefilter resulted in higher IgG mass throughput. Thus, using an appropriately sized in-line prefilter could provide more robust antibody throughput performance on scale-down membrane anion-exchange units.", "journal": "Biotechnology progress", "date": "2010-09-10", "authors": ["Ajay RLajmi", "SamuelNochumson", "AymBerges"], "doi": "10.1002/btpr.483"}

{"title": "High-speed tracking control of piezoelectric actuators using an ellipse-based hysteresis model.", "abstract": "In this paper, an ellipse-based mathematic model is developed to characterize the rate-dependent hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators. Based on the proposed model, an expanded input space is constructed to describe the multivalued hysteresis function H[u](t) by a multiple input single output (MISO) mapping Gamma:R(2)-->R. Subsequently, the inverse MISO mapping Gamma(-1)(H[u](t),H[u](t);u(t)) is proposed for real-time hysteresis compensation. In controller design, a hybrid control strategy combining a model-based feedforward controller and a proportional integral differential (PID) feedback loop is used for high-accuracy and high-speed tracking control of piezoelectric actuators. The real-time feedforward controller is developed to cancel the rate-dependent hysteresis based on the inverse hysteresis model, while the PID controller is used to compensate for the creep, modeling errors, and parameter uncertainties. Finally, experiments with and without hysteresis compensation are conducted and the experimental results are compared. The experimental results show that the hysteresis compensation in the feedforward path can reduce the hysteresis-caused error by up to 88% and the tracking performance of the hybrid controller is greatly improved in high-speed tracking control applications, e.g., the root-mean-square tracking error is reduced to only 0.34% of the displacement range under the input frequency of 100 Hz.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["GuoyingGu", "LiminZhu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3470117"}

The match between experiment and theory is so close that it not only facilitates the absolute calibration the sensors but it also allows the limits of Hertz theory to be probed.

{"title": "A micro-machined piezoelectric flexural-mode hydrophone with air backing: a hydrostatic pressure-balancing mechanism for integrity preservation.", "abstract": "Although an air-backed thin plate is an effective sound receiver structure, it is easily damaged via pressure unbalance caused by external hydrostatic pressure. To overcome this difficulty, a simple pressure-balancing module is proposed. Despite its small size and relative simplicity, with proper design and operation, micro-channel structure provides a solution to the pressure-balancing problem. If the channel size is sufficiently small, the gas-liquid interface may move back and forth without breach by the hydrostatic pressure since the surface tension can retain the interface surface continuously. One input port of the device is opened to an intermediate liquid, while the other port is connected to the air-backing chamber. As the hydrostatic pressure increases, the liquid in the micro-channel compresses the air, and the pressure in the backing chamber is then equalized to match the external hydrostatic pressure. To validate the performance of the proposed mechanism, a micro-channel prototype is designed and integrated with the piezoelectric micro-machined flexural sensor developed in our previous work. The working principle of the mechanism is experimentally verified.

Implant sites were prepared by an Er:YAG laser, a dental drill or a piezoelectric device. For each time period, six implants were used for biomechanical removal torque testing and six implants for a semi-quantitative histological assessment of the bone-to-implant contact (BIC).\nAn initially missing implant adjusted site preparation led to slightly higher BIC and torque values in the piezoelectric and laser groups due to a press-fit effect after 4 weeks. Statistical analysis of the average mean BIC after 4, 6, and 8 weeks revealed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the different osteotomy techniques. Comparison of individual removal torque values showed the highest value for laser osteotomy after 8 weeks (1,698.50 +/- 67.52 Nmm), which was significantly higher than the corresponding value for drill osteotomy (P = 0.006).\nAlthough BIC and removal torque values decreased in the laser and piezoelectric groups at 6 weeks during an active remodeling process, favorable and superior BIC as well as torque values could be demonstrated at 8 weeks.

The intrinsic piezoelectric response of the monoclinic (M(C)) PMN-xPT crystals, 0.31</=x</=0.35, exhibited peak values for compositions close to R-M(C) and M(C)-T phase boundaries, however, being less than 2000 pCN.

The maximum piezoelectric response was observed in rhombohedral PMN-0.30PT crystals, being on the order of 2500 pCN. This ultrahigh piezoelectric response was determined to be related to the high shear piezoelectric activity of single domain state, corresponding to an ease in polarization rotation, for compositions close to a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). The role of monoclinic phase is only to form a MPB with R phase, but not directly contribute to the ultrahigh piezoelectric activity in rhombohedral PMN-0.30PT crystals. The extrinsic contribution to piezoelectric activity was found to be less than 5% for the compositions away from R-M(C) and M(C)-T phase boundaries, due to a stable domain engineered structure.

Oscillations stemming from the weakly damped resonances of the tube scanner are a major source of image distortion, putting a limitation on the achievable imaging speed. This paper demonstrates active damping of these oscillations in multiple scanning axes without the need for additional position sensors. By connecting the tube scanner in a capacitive bridge circuit the scanner oscillations can be measured in both scanning axes, using the same piezo material as an actuator and sensor simultaneously. In order to compensate for circuit imbalance caused by hysteresis in the piezo element, an adaptive balancing circuit is used. The obtained measurement signal is used for feedback control, reducing the resonance peaks in both scanning axes by 18 dB and the cross-coupling at those frequencies by 30 dB. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in scanner oscillations when applying the typical triangular scanning signals, as well as a strong reduction in coupling induced oscillations.

Stapes motions were measured with acoustic stimuli as well as mechanical stimuli using a custom-made three-axis piezoelectric actuator, and errors in the motion components were analyzed. The ratio of error in each motion component was reduced by increasing the magnitude of the stimuli, but the improvement was limited when the motion component was small relative to other components. This problem was solved with an improved reflectivity on the measurement surface. Errors in estimating the position of the stapes also caused errors on the coordinates of the measurement points and the laser beam direction relative to the stapes footplate, thus producing errors in the 3-D motion components. This effect was small when the position error of the stapes footplate did not exceed 5 degrees.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2010-08-31", "authors": ["Jae HoonSim", "MichaelLauxmann", "MichailChatzimichalis", "ChristofR\u00f6\u00f6sli", "AlbrechtEiber", "Alexander MHuber"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2010.08.009"}
{"title": "Calibration of the 1-MHz Sonitron ultrasound system.", "abstract": "Successful drug and gene delivery across cellular membranes can lead to improved therapeutic outcomes. Recent studies have suggested that sonoporation may enhance drug and gene delivery across cellular membranes. The enhancement may be a result of transient permeation of the membrane from cavitation or microstreaming effects of microbubbles exposed to ultrasound. Given limited acoustic pressure calibration and beam profile characterization of the Sonitron ultrasound systems in cellular bioeffects studies previously published, the objective of this work was to calibrate the acoustic output and explore the potential for standing waves in a cell-well plate. In this study, three 1-MHz transducers driven by Sonitron ultrasound systems, which have been used in a number of sonoporation studies, were calibrated. Transducers with 10-mm, 6-mm and 20-mm-diameter apertures (Sonitron 1000 and 2000, Rich-Mar, Inola, OK, USA) were calibrated using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) needle hydrophones. Axial and transverse beam profiles were obtained, and the pressures were measured as a function of Sonitron intensity dial setting and duty cycle. The acoustic intensity was calculated and compared with the Sonitron intensity dial setting for duty cycles from 10-100%. Standing waves caused by reflections from the hydrophone holder were detected for each transducer. This observation may also have implications for in vitro sonoporation studies.

Inkjet printing of line patterns with a feature size of 100 microm width and lengths ranging from 1 to 5 cm was performed on glass substrates with a piezoelectric inkjet printer.

The use of gum arabic for the dispersion of carboxyl-functionalized nanotubes demonstrated a further drastic decrease (18-fold) of the resistance compared with a purified CNT-based composite owing to the formation of an extended continuous network within the line pattern.

{"title": "Electrically active nanomaterials as improved neural tissue regeneration scaffolds.", "abstract": "Numerous biomaterials have provided promising results toward improving the function of injured nervous system tissue. However, significant hurdles, such as delayed or incomplete tissue regeneration, remain toward full functional recovery of nervous system tissue. Because of this continual need for better nervous system biomaterials, more recent approaches to design the next generation of tissue engineering scaffolds for the nervous system have incorporated nanotechnology, or more specifically, nanoscale surface feature dimensions which mimic natural neural tissue. Compared to conventional materials with micron-scale surface dimensions, nanomaterials have exhibited an ability to enhance desirable neural cell activity while minimizing unwanted cell activity, such as reactive astrocyte activity in the central nervous system. The complexity of neural tissue injury and the presence of inhibitory cues as well as the absence of stimulatory cues may require multifaceted treatment approaches with customized biomaterials that nanotechnology can provide. Combinations of stimulatory cues may be used to incorporate nanoscale topographical and chemical or electrical cues in the same scaffold to provide an environment for tissue regeneration that is superior to inert scaffolds. Ongoing research in the field of electrically active nanomaterials includes the fabrication of composite materials with nanoscale, piezoelectric zinc oxide particles embedded into a polymer matrix. Zinc oxide, when mechanically deformed through ultrasound, for example, can theoretically provide an electrical stimulus, a known stimulatory cue for neural tissue regeneration.

{"title": "A strong ferroelectric ferromagnet created by means of spin-lattice coupling.", "abstract": "Ferroelectric ferromagnets are exceedingly rare, fundamentally interesting multiferroic materials that could give rise to new technologies in which the low power and high speed of field-effect electronics are combined with the permanence and routability of voltage-controlled ferromagnetism. Furthermore, the properties of the few compounds that simultaneously exhibit these phenomena are insignificant in comparison with those of useful ferroelectrics or ferromagnets: their spontaneous polarizations or magnetizations are smaller by a factor of 1,000 or more. The same holds for magnetic- or electric-field-induced multiferroics. Owing to the weak properties of single-phase multiferroics, composite and multilayer approaches involving strain-coupled piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components are the closest to application today. Recently, however, a new route to ferroelectric ferromagnets was proposed by which magnetically ordered insulators that are neither ferroelectric nor ferromagnetic are transformed into ferroelectric ferromagnets using a single control parameter, strain. The system targeted, EuTiO(3), was predicted to exhibit strong ferromagnetism (spontaneous magnetization, approximately 7 Bohr magnetons per Eu) and strong ferroelectricity (spontaneous polarization, approximately 10 microC cm(-2)) simultaneously under large biaxial compressive strain. These values are orders of magnitude higher than those of any known ferroelectric ferromagnet and rival the best materials that are solely ferroelectric or ferromagnetic. Hindered by the absence of an appropriate substrate to provide the desired compression we turned to tensile strain. Here we show both experimentally and theoretically the emergence of a multiferroic state under biaxial tension with the unexpected benefit that even lower strains are required, thereby allowing thicker high-quality crystalline films. This realization of a strong ferromagnetic ferroelectric points the way to high-temperature manifestations of this spin-lattice coupling mechanism.

{"title": "Enhancement of IVF in the mouse by zona-drilling.", "abstract": "Cryopreservation of mouse sperm has become an essential method for the long-term storage of novel, genetically modified mouse lines. Cryopreserved sperm from most hybrid lines can be effectively used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) of mouse oocytes. Unfortunately, IVF recovery with cryopreserved sperm from inbred lines is very inefficient. This is especially troublesome since many transgenic lines are created on the popular C57Bl/6 inbred strain. Cryopreserved sperm from C57Bl/6 inbred and genetically modified lines is generally very inefficient when used in standard IVF recovery experiments, with fertilization rates that can be lower than 10%. Assisted reproductive techniques have been developed to improve the IVF efficiencies of cryopreserved inbred sperm. These techniques include zona-drilling, which introduces a hole into the zona pellucida (ZP) surrounding mouse oocytes, using a chemical solution (acid Tyrode's), mechanical disruption (partial zona dissection or piezo-driven micropipette drilling), or laser photoablation. By allowing direct access of the sperm to the cytoplasmic membrane, zona-drilling can improve the efficiency of IVF fertilization rates with inbred sperm to greater than 90%, thus improving the chances of recovering mouse lines on inbred backgrounds that are maintained with cryopreserved sperm. The technique described in this chapter makes use of a piezo controller to mechanically disrupt the ZP, resulting in dramatic increases in the fertilization efficiency of cryopreserved sperm.", "journal": "Methods in enzymology", "date": "2010-08-10", "authors": ["Kevin AKelley"], "doi": "10.1016/S0076-6879(10)76013-4"}

Although the success rates of somatic cloning have been inefficient and the mechanism of reprogramming is still largely unknown, therefore, the nuclear transfer (NT) method has been thought of as a \"black box approach\" and inadequate to determine the detail of how genomic reprogramming occurs. However, only the NT approach can reveal dynamic and global modifications in the epigenome without using genetic modification, as well as can create live animals. At present, this is the only technique available for the preservation and propagation of valuable genetic resources from mutant mice that are infertile or too old, or recovered from carcasses, without the use of germ cells. This chapter describes a basic protocol for mouse cloning and embryonic stem (ES) cell establishment from cloned embryo using a piezo-actuated micromanipulator.

We have developed an in process control filtration-assisted chemiluminometric immunoassay (FAL-ELISA), to detect and quantify NCP in vaccine-antigen batches regardless of its volume and composition. Samples are filtered through PVDF-filter microplates pre-coated with a monoclonal antibody against NCP. Filtration removes all unbound components in the sample and captured NCP are detected by anti-NCP conjugate followed by incubation with the substrate, luminol/peroxide. Analytical detection limit was 2 ng for purified NCP and 4 ng for vaccine-antigen batches spiked with NCP, which makes this assay sensitive enough to be applied to purity control of FMD vaccines.

Commonly known as a neurotransmitter, dopamine is also a small-molecule mimic of the adhesive proteins of mussels. Polymerization of dopamine in the presence of template molecule (1,3,5-pentanetricarboxylic acid, an analogue of domoic acid, in this case) could produce an adherent molecularly imprinted polydopamine film coating on QCM crystals. Advantages, such as high hydrophilicity, high biocompatibility and controllable thickness, make this molecularly imprinted polydopamine film an attractive recognition element for sensors. Selective rebinding of domoic acid on mussel-inspired molecularly imprinted polymer (m-MIP) coated crystal was observed as a frequency shift quantified by piezoelectric microgravimetry with the QCM system. The decreasing frequency shows a good linear relationship with the concentration of domoic acid. The quantitation limit of domoic acid was 5 ppb with the linear range of 0-100 ppb. The QCM sensor has high selectivity and was able to distinguish domoic acid from its analogous p-phthalic acid and o-phthalic acid owing to the molecular imprinting effect. In addition, the practical analytical performance of the sensor was examined by evaluating the detection of domoic acid in mussel extracts with satisfactory results. It is envisaged that m-MIP could be suitable as recognition element for sensors and the proposed m-MIP QCM sensor could be employed to detect analyte of interest in complex matrices.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2010-08-06", "authors": ["Wen-HuiZhou", "Shui-FenTang", "Qiu-HongYao", "Fa-RongChen", "Huang-HaoYang", "Xiao-RuWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2010.07.024"}

The osteotome technique has been developed for minor sinus floor elevation. This is a method with relatively high predictability but is technically demanding. During the past decade, different osteotome-mediated sinus floor elevation techniques have been developed to augment the sinus for predictable implant placement. All these methods aim to access a better, predictable sinus augmentation with low morbidity. Some of these techniques require special equipment or materials, complicated procedure, and a long learning curve. This article describes an innovative approach to sinus augmentation, namely, piezoelectric-assisted osteotome-mediated sinus floor elevation. This method uses a newly designed piezoelectric tip, which can perform sinus floor osteotomy in a simple and atraumatic way. This approach has the greatest advantages of good tactile sense in osteotomy, least perforation, patient comfort with the least and lightest malleting, and shortened surgery.

{"title": "Analytical study of dual-mode thin film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) based on ZnO and AlN films with tilted c-axis orientation.", "abstract": "In this paper, we present the analytical study of thin film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBARs) using ZnO and AlN films with a c-axis tilt angle (off-normal) from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. The tilted c-axis orientation induces normal plane and inplane polarizations, which leads to the coexistence of the longitudinal mode and shear mode in the resonator. The equation for predicting electric impedance of FBARs was derived from the basic piezoelectric constitutive equations. Material properties including elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric coefficients, bulk wave properties including acoustic velocity and electromechanical coupling coefficient, and impedance of FBARs were calculated and showed strong dependence on the tilt angle. Interestingly, it was found that for ZnO FBARs, pure thickness longitudinal modes occur at 0 degrees and 65.4 degrees, and pure thickness shear modes occur at 43 degrees and 90 degrees. For AlN FBARs, pure longitudinal modes occur at 0 degrees and 67.1 degrees, and pure shear modes occur at 46.1 degrees and 90 degrees for AlN. In other words, pure thickness longitudinal and shear modes exist in ZnO and AlN FBARs at specific tilted polarization angles. In addition, two peaks of shear mode electromechanical coefficient are found at 33.3 degrees and 90 degrees for ZnO, and 34.5 degrees and 90 degrees for AlN. Therefore, ZnO and AlN films with specific tilt angles may provide options in the design and fabrication of FBARs, considering their strong shear resonance with high electromechanical coefficients. The use of dual-mode FBARs for mass sensors is also analyzed; the calculated large resonant frequency shift caused by mass loading shows that they have good prospects for use in sensor applications with high sensitivity. The simulation results agreed well with the reported experiment results, and can be used for design and application of FBARs.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2010-08-04", "authors": ["LifengQin", "QingmingChen", "HongbinCheng", "Qing-MingWang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1623"}
{"title": "Theory and experimental verifications of the resonator Q and equivalent electrical parameters due to viscoelastic and mounting supports losses.", "abstract": "A novel analytical/numerical method for calculating the resonator Q and its equivalent electrical parameters due to viscoelastic, conductivity, and mounting supports losses is presented. The method presented will be quite useful for designing new resonators and reducing the time and costs of prototyping. There was also a necessity for better and more realistic modeling of the resonators because of miniaturization and the rapid advances in the frequency ranges of telecommunication. We present new 3-D finite elements models of quartz resonators with viscoelasticity, conductivity, and mounting support losses. The losses at the mounting supports were modeled by perfectly matched layers (PMLs). A previously published theory for dissipative anisotropic piezoelectric solids was formulated in a weak form for finite element (FE) applications. PMLs were placed at the base of the mounting supports to simulate the energy losses to a semi-infinite base substrate. FE simulations were carried out for free vibrations and forced vibrations of quartz tuning fork and AT-cut resonators. Results for quartz tuning fork and thickness shear AT-cut resonators were presented and compared with experimental data. Results for the resonator Q and the equivalent electrical parameters were compared with their measured values. Good equivalences were found. Results for both low- and high-Q AT-cut quartz resonators compared well with their experimental values. A method for estimating the Q directly from the frequency spectrum obtained for free vibrations was also presented. An important determinant of the quality factor Q of a quartz resonator is the loss of energy from the electrode area to the base via the mountings. The acoustical characteristics of the plate resonator are changed when the plate is mounted onto a base substrate. The base affects the frequency spectra of the plate resonator. A resonator with a high Q may not have a similarly high Q when mounted on a base. Hence, the base is an energy sink and the Q will be affected by the shape and size of this base. A lower-bound Q will be obtained if the base is a semi-infinite base because it will absorb all acoustical energies radiated from the resonator.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2010-08-04", "authors": ["Yook-KongYong", "Mihir SPatel", "MasakoTanaka"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1622"}

Two 3 minute periods of intra-oral pressure monitoring were conducted on each participant, using two different oral end fittings connected to a piezo-resistive relative pressure sensor: (1) a flexible OS and (2) a small-dimensioned air-permeable end cap (EC), which was placed laterally in the premolar region, thus recording intra-oral pressure independent of the influence of the OS. Pressure curve characteristics for both periods and between the malocclusion groups were evaluated with reference to the frequency of swallowing peaks, duration, and altitude of negative pressure plateau phases and the area under the pressure curve. Statistical analysis was undertaken using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test, and spearman correlation coefficient. A median number of two peaks (median height -20.9 mbar) and three plateau phases (median height of -2.3 mbar) may be regarded as normative for normal occlusion subjects during a 3 minute period, at rest. OS application raised the median average duration and height of intra-oral negative pressure plateau phases in the II1 subjects, exceeding those of group I, but less than the plateau duration in group II2.

In a recent study, we analyzed the PPG signal and detected the FM and amplitude modulation effect that controlled breathing had on it, and inferred the rate of respiration using the time-frequency spectrum (TFS) (via a wavelet (WT) or complex demodulation (CDM) approach). We showed that such TFS BR detection methods were very accurate and consistently outperformed the exclusively time-domain autoregressive modeling (AR) method, especially in the real-time (data length of 1 min) case. We now explore the possibility of using these methods on the ECG and the finger PZO signal, of which only the former has been previously used with some success to derive BR. Testing performed on 15 healthy human subjects for a range of BR and two body positions showed that though the PPG signal gave the most consistently high performance, the ECG and PZO also proved to be reasonably accurate over longer time segments.

Polarization degradation was observed to suddenly occur above 50-100 bipolar cycles in <110> oriented samples, while <001> oriented samples exhibited almost fatigue free characteristics. The fatigue behavior was investigated as a function of orientation, magnitude of the electric field and manganese dopant.

The stack is subsequently cured and baked to enhance the acoustic properties of the interfacial resist.

In this paper we discuss the fractionation of the different PEGylated forms of a protein by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a stack of hydrophilized PVDF membrane, which has been shown to be environment responsive, as stationary phase. With the model protein examined in this study (i.e. lysozyme), the apparent hydrophobicity in the presence of a lyotropic salt increased with the degree of PEGylation. Based on this, unmodified lysozyme and its mono-, di- and tri-PEGylated forms could each be resolved into separate chromatographic peaks.

The present work focuses on the relative efficiency of a signal combining two neighbouring frequencies and a one-frequency signal for initiating ultrasound inertial cavitation. Experiments were carried out in a water tank, using a 550kHz piezoelectric composite spherical transducer focused on targets with 46\u03bcm roughness. The acoustic signal scattered, either by the target or by the cavitation bubbles, is filtered using a spectral and cepstral-like method to obtain an inertial cavitation activity measurement. The ultrasound excitations consist of 1.8ms single bursts of single frequency f(0)=550kHz excitation, in the monofrequency case, and of dual frequency f(1)=535kHz and f(2)=565kHz excitation, in the bifrequency case. It is shown that depending on the value of the monofrequency cavitation threshold intensity the bifrequency excitation can increase or reduce the cavitation threshold. The analysis of the thresholds indicates that the mechanisms involved are nonlinear. The progress of the cavitation activity beyond the cavitation threshold is also studied. The slope of the cavitation activity considered as a function of the acoustic intensity is always steeper in the case of the bifrequency excitation. This means that the delimitation of the region where cavitation occurs should be cleaner than with a classical monofrequency excitation.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2010-07-20", "authors": ["IzellaSaletes", "BrunoGilles", "Jean-ChristopheBera"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2010.06.003"}
{"title": "Ultrasound focusing using magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging: application to ultrasound transcranial therapy.", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance guided ultrasonic therapy is a promising minimally invasive technology for constantly growing variety of clinical applications. Delivery of focused ultrasound (FUS) energy to the targeted point with optimal intensity is highly desired; however, due to tissue aberrations, optimal focal intensity is not always achieved. Especially in transcranial applications, the acoustic waves are shifted and distorted mainly by the skull. In order to verify that magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) can be used as a focusing tool in transcranial treatments, such an imaging was applied in vivo on a porcine brain via ex vivo human skull. Then, by the use of MR-ARFI technique, an improved ultrasound focusing algorithm is proposed and demonstrated for both transcranial and none brain applications.\nMR-ARFI images were acquired on a GE 1.5 T scanner equipped with InSightec FUS systems ExAblate 2000 and ExAblate 4000. Imaging was performed with MR-ARFI sequences of line-scan spin-echo and single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar. The in-plane resolution of both acquisitions was 0.9 x 0.9 mm2. The total acquisition time of MR-ARFI image was 31 s by the line-scan sequence and 1 s by the echo-planar sequence. An in vivo experiment was performed using FUS transducer, which is built out of 1024 ultrasound transmitting piezoelectric elements at 220 kHz frequency. The transducer was focused into the brain of a pig, which was wrapped in a human skull, in degassed water environment to resemble human treatments. The pig underwent a wide bilateral craniectomy to prevent a bone heating from the ultrasound beams. Two focusing experiments were performed in phantoms using 1 MHz and 710 kHz FUS transducers working with 208 and 225 elements, respectively. In the first experiment, aberration was added virtually to the apparatus by adding random phases to the phase map of the transducer. A simple focusing correction scheme was used, in which the corrected phase of a group of elements was chosen such that it maximizes the radiation force at the focal point. In the second experiment, aberrations made by a human skull were corrected using geometrical and phase based adjustments on segments of the transducer.\nA maximum displacement of 10 microm was obtained using 1.4 kW acoustic power on a live pig's head that its skull was removed and replaced by ex vivo human skull. Aberration correction using MR-ARFI resulted in near optimal focus, as the radiation force was similar to the nonaberration case. Transcranial, MR-ARFI based aberration correction performed better than CT based aberration correction, a technique that is currently used in brain FUS treatments.\nIn the present work, the authors show for the first time a result of MR-ARFI in a live brain through ex vivo human skull. They have demonstrated that aberration correction could be done using MR-ARFI by measuring the radiation force at the focal point. Aberration correction using MR-ARFI is a promising noninvasive technique for transcranial focusing, which may result in near optimal focus and more reliable and safer brain FUS treatments.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2010-07-17", "authors": ["YHertzberg", "AVolovick", "YZur", "YMedan", "SVitek", "GNavon"], "doi": "10.1118/1.3395553"}

The ion source is modeled as a controlled-current electrolytic cell, in which the piezoelectric transducer electrode, which mechanically drives the charged droplet generation using ultrasonic atomization, also acts as the oxidizing/corroding anode (positive mode). The interplay between advective and diffusive ion transport of electrochemically generated ions is analyzed as a function of the transducer duty cycle and electrode location. A time scale analysis of the relative importance of advective vs. diffusive ion transport provides valuable insight into optimality, from the ionization prospective, of alternative design and operation modes of the ion source operation. A computational model based on the solution of time-averaged, quasi-steady advection-diffusion equations for electroactive species transport is used to substantiate the conclusions of the time scale analysis. The results show that electrochemical ion generation at the piezoelectric transducer electrodes located at the back-side of the ion source reservoir results in poor ionization efficiency due to insufficient time for the charged analyte to diffuse away from the electrode surface to the ejection location, especially at near 100% duty cycle operation. Reducing the duty cycle of droplet/analyte ejection increases the analyte residence time and, in turn, improves ionization efficiency, but at an expense of the reduced device throughput. For applications where this is undesirable, i.e., multiplexed and disposable device configurations, an alternative electrode location is incorporated. By moving the charging electrode to the nozzle surface, the diffusion length scale is greatly reduced, drastically improving ionization efficiency. The ionization efficiency of all operating conditions considered is expressed as a function of the dimensionless Peclet number, which defines the relative effect of advection as compared to diffusion. This analysis is general enough to elucidate an important role of electrochemistry in ionization efficiency of any arrayed ion sources, be they mechanically-driven or electrosprays, and is vital for determining optimal design and operation conditions.", "journal": "Journal of electroanalytical chemistry (Lausanne, Switzerland)", "date": "2010-07-08", "authors": ["Thomas PForbes", "F LeventDegertekin", "Andrei GFedorov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jelechem.2010.05.004"}

In this paper, we report that through designing multi-layered structures with carbon nanofiber (CNF)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composites intercalated by a pure PVDF layer, enhanced dielectric constant and low loss were achieved. The dielectric loss was similar to that of pure PVDF at high frequencies and even lower than pure PVDF at low frequencies. The results were achieved by designing special multi-layered structures including CNF/PVDF composite layers. The multi-layered sandwich-like or laminate structure composites with transversely heterogeneous CNF distributions were prepared using a simple two-step processing including solution casting and compression molding methods. The dielectric constant obtained from the sandwich structure containing 5, 7 and 15 wt% CNF/PVDF composite layers is even more independent of the frequency in a wide range from 10(2) to 10(6) Hz. Furthermore, the effects of the heterogeneous CNF distribution on the dielectric properties were studied by designing different multi-layered composite structures with varying architecture while maintaining the same CNF concentration level. It is shown that varying this stack-up architecture of different CNF distributions plays an important role in the enhancement level of the dielectric constant while having negligible effect on the dielectric loss of the nanocomposite, which is determined mainly by the CNF loading content.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2010-07-07", "authors": ["L LSun", "BLi", "YZhao", "GMitchell", "W HZhong"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/305702"}

The purpose of this work is to present the theoretical and experimental validation of an ultrasonic methodology for estimating the acoustical properties of paraffin wax on the surface of steel. The method is based on modeling and inversion of the complete electro-acoustic channel from the transmitted voltage over the active piezoelectric element, to the received voltage resulting from the acoustic reverberations in the multilayered structure. In the current work, two conceptually different models of the same multi-layer transducer structure attached to steel is developed and compared with measurements. A method is then suggested for suppressing the strong reverberations in steel, hence isolating the wax signals. This contrast enhancement method is fitted to the model of the structure, facilitating parameter inversion from the wax layer. The results show that the models agree well with measurements and that up to three parameters (travel time, impedance and attenuation) can be inverted from the wax simultaneously. Hence, given one of the three parameters, density, sound speed or thickness, the other two can be estimated in addition to the attenuation.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2010-07-06", "authors": ["TarjeiRommetveit", "Tonni FJohansen", "RoyJohnsen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2010.06.002"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of posterior mandibular alveolar ridge deficiencies with the piezoelectric hinge-assisted ridge split technique: a retrospective observational report.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of alveolar defects in the posterior edentulous mandible can be a difficult task. In addition to complicating anatomic features, such as the inferior alveolar nerve, mental foramen, oblique ridge, and lingual undercut of the mylohyoid ridge, edentulous ridges in the posterior mandible have thicker cortices and decreased volumes of vascular trabecular bone than their maxillary counterparts. Traditionally, these areas have been treated with autogenous block grafts. Significant resorption of these grafts, in combination with patient morbidity at secondary donor sites, has led clinicians to seek alternatives for augmenting the edentulous posterior mandible. The aim of this retrospective consecutive case series is to report on both the technique of the piezoelectric hinge-assisted ridge split procedure for augmenting these sites and the results that were achieved.\nThirteen patients with 17 horizontal alveolar ridge deficiencies of the posterior mandible were treated with the piezoelectric hinge-assisted ridge split procedure. After an average healing period of 14 weeks, dental implants were placed into the augmented sites. Intrasurgical alveolar ridge measurements taken at the initial surgery and subsequently at the time of implant placement documented the horizontal gains achieved by this procedure.\nOverall mean gain in horizontal width was 4.03 mm (\u00b1 0.67). For single implant-site augmentations, the mean gain was 3.38 mm (\u00b1 0.25). For multiple adjacent implant-site augmentations, mean gain was 4.25 mm (\u00b1 0.62). A total of 31 dental implants were successfully placed in all sites and none required additional augmentation procedures. There were no instances of adverse outcomes, such as neurosensory deficits or sequestration of mobilized buccal plates. After a minimum of 6 months of loading, all dental implants have been successful.\nThis retrospective observational report demonstrates that the piezoelectric hinge-assisted ridge split procedure can achieve substantial gains in horizontal ridge width of the edentulous posterior mandible without associated morbidity.

Our results show that the acoustic waves are effectively self-focused by constructive interference in glycerin (with a viscosity of 1400 mPa s), giving small focal points with a high pressure. Due to the high attenuation, the wave pressure decreases significantly with the distance from the FZP. Nevertheless, the pressure at the focal points 2.5 and 6.5 mm from the FZP is high enough to eject glycerin droplets in the drop-on-demand mode.

In this paper, two novel modeling techniques are demonstrated to extract the axial and torsional resonant frequencies of a complex nonlinear geometry. The first decomposes the complex geometry into easy to model components, while the second uses scaling techniques combined with the finite element method. Both models overcome problems associated with using current analytical methods as design tools, and enable a full investigation of how changes in the geometric parameters affect the resonant frequencies of interest.

Generally, the intraosseous maxillary branches ran caudo-rostrally; but in five maxillae, we found two parallel arteries, while in three cases the maxillary artery ran vertically. No differences were found between the left and right side.\nThe risk of vascular damage in sinus floor elevation surgery is a real problem for the oral surgeon. Detailed anatomical knowledge about sinus vascularization is very important to reduce the risk of vascular damage and bleeding. In addition the visualization of sinus anastomosis by radiology and less invasive surgery, such as piezo-surgery, could be helpful.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2010-07-01", "authors": ["L FRodella", "MLabanca", "RBoninsegna", "GFavero", "MTschabitscher", "RRezzani"], "doi": null}

{"title": "A new method to efficiently produce transgenic embryos and mice from low-titer lentiviral vectors.", "abstract": "Vector injection into the perivitelline space has emerged as the standard delivery method to transduce lentivirus to mammalian oocytes or one-cell embryos, but its application is limited by the need for high titers of lentivirus. Herein we developed a new method by using a Piezo impact micro-manipulator for injecting low titer of lentivirus into the subzonal space of two-cell embryos or the perivitelline space of one-cell embryos that were shrunk with a highly concentrated sucrose solution. The survival rate of embryos was greater than 98% using this micromanipulation strategy, which was increased compared to the normal one-cell embryo injection method. More than 90% of injected embryos were GFP positive after subzonal injection of a lentivirus vector carrying the GFP gene with titers of 2 \u00d7 10\u2078 I.U./ml. Even when a low titer of lentivirus (2 \u00d7 10\u2076 I.U./ml) was used, 53.26% and 40.85% transgenic embryos were obtained after two-cell embryonic injection and one-cell sucrose treated embryonic injection, respectively. The GFP-positive rates were also greater than in the conventional method of injecting one-cell embryos (25.39%). In addition, blastocysts from the two-cell embryo injection group displayed stronger GFP fluorescence than the one-cell embryo injection groups treated with or without the sucrose solution. Increased expression of GFP suggests that the embryos obtained from this injection method have higher exogenous gene expression levels compared to previous methods. Therefore, in contrast with the traditional injection method, we have demonstrated a simplified and efficient lentivirus-mediated gene transfer method based on a low-titer virus preparation.", "journal": "Transgenic research", "date": "2010-06-30", "authors": ["KaiMiao", "MinGuo", "LeiAn", "Xiao LingXu", "HanWu", "DongWang", "Zhong HongWu", "Jian HuiTian"], "doi": "10.1007/s11248-010-9414-5"}

The objectives of the present study were to report our experience with the piezoelectric device in the intact canal mastoidectomy, and to compare the results with traditional method by means of microdrill. A non-randomized controlled trial was undertaken on 60 intact canal wall mastoidectomy performed using the piezoelectric device (30 patients) or the microdrill (30 patients). Before 1 month and 1 year after surgery, all the patients underwent the following instrumental examinations: otomicroscopic evaluation of the tympanic membrane and external auditory duct, bone conduction threshold audiometry, tympanometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions with linear click emission, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response (ABR) by MK 12-ABR screener with natus-ALGO2e (Amplifon, Milan, Italy), and electronystamographic recording. The piezoelectric device is proved to be effective in sclerotic and pneumatic mastoid, with an excellent control and without side effects on the adjacent structures of the middle and inner ear (lateral sinus, facial nerve, and/or dura mater). The operation time has been the same as compared with microdrill, and the average hospital stay was significantly (p < 0.05) shorter.

With handheld devices the measuring procedure is brought to bedside and surgery theatres, as well as to patients who are not able to sit behind the slit lamp. The dynamic contour tonometer (DCT) represents a new method of direct IOP measurement. Its physical principle is based on piezo-electronic contour matching tonometry and is claimed to be less dependent on biochemical properties of the cornea. Besides the IOP, the ocular pulse amplitude can also be measured. Until now, the DCT had been available as a slit lamp mounted device. In this report, we present a portable prototype of the device.

This mAb was used in a Far Western blotting experiment in which VE was separated by electrophoresis, and then transferred to a PVDF strip that was incubated with SP-ML. It was found that SP-ML binds to the VE component gp37 (Xenopus homolog of mammalian ZP1). The antigens reactive to mAb 16A2A7 showed apparent molecular weights of 65-130 and 20-30 kDa, and were distributed relatively evenly over the entire sperm surface. Periodate oxidation revealed that both the pertinent epitope on the sperm surface and the ligands of VE gp37 were sugar moieties.

In vivo interstitial MMP activity (fluorescent substrate cleavage; 943+/-59 versus 1210+/-72 U; P<0.05) in the MI region was lower with LHFS than in UNSTIM. In the MI region, MMP-2 levels were lower and TIMP-1 and collagen levels were higher with LHFS than in UNSTIM (all P<0.05). Transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1 and phosphorylated SMAD-2/3 levels within the MI region were higher with LHFS than in UNSTIM. Electric stimulation (4 Hz) of isolated fibroblasts resulted in reduced MMP-2 and MT1-MMP levels but increased TIMP-1 levels compared with unstimulated fibroblasts.\nThese unique findings demonstrate that LHFS of the MI region altered left ventricular wall thickness and material properties, likely as a result of reduced regional MMP activity.

{"title": "Evaluation of toxicity and antitumor activity of cycloviolacin O2 in mice.", "abstract": "Cycloviolacin O2 is a small cyclic cysteine-rich protein belonging to the group of plant proteins called cyclotides. This cyclotide has been previously shown to exert cytotoxic activity against a variety of human tumor cell lines as well as primary cultures of human tumor cells in vitro. This study is the first evaluation of its tolerability and antitumor activity in vivo. Maximal-tolerated doses were estimated to 1.5 mg/kg for single intravenous (i.v.) dosing and 0.5 mg/kg for daily repeated dosing, respectively. Two different in vivo methods were used: the hollow fiber method with single dosing (i.v., 1.0 mg/kg) and traditional xenografts with repeated dosing over 2 weeks (i.v., 0.5 mg/kg daily, 5 days a week). The human tumor cell lines used displayed dose-dependent in vitro sensitivity (including growth in hollow fibers to confirm passage of cycloviolacin O2 through the polyvinylidene fluoride fibers), with IC5o values in the micromolar range. Despite this sensitivity in vitro, no significant antitumor effects were detected in vivo, neither with single dosing in the hollow fiber method nor with repeated dosing in xenografts. In summary, the results indicate that antitumor effects are minor or absent at tolerable (sublethal) doses, and cycloviolacin O2 has a very abrupt in vivo toxicity profile, with lethality after single injection at 2 mg/kg, but no signs of discomfort to the animals at 1.5 mg/kg.

The developed method was successfully applied for detection of total nickel in samples taken from several hot springs located at the Northwest of Iran. The frequency shifts were linear with respect to the concentration of nickel in solution. Using this method, nickel can be measured in the range of 3-20 mg L(-1). A lower limit of detection of 0.79 mg L(-1) and a sensitivity factor of 4.429 Hz/mg L(-1) were obtained. Some possible interference such as heavy metal ions (lead, mercury, and cadmium) was checked. No major interference was observed with the performance of the sensor except for mercury. To evaluate the ability of the PPy-modified QCN in discriminating between nickel ions and interfering mercury ions, a principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out. PCA was utilized to process the frequency response data of the single piezoelectric crystal at different times, considering different adsorption-desorption dynamics of nickel and interfering mercury ions on electrode. Using PCA, it was found that about 97.90% of the data variance could still be explained by two principal components (PC1 and PC2).

The feed concentration had no marked impact on the permeate flux and the rejection of fluoride. The precipitation of CaCO3 would clog the hollow fiber inlets and foul the membrane surface with the increase of concentration factor when natural groundwater was used directly as the feed, which resulted in a rapid decline of the module efficiency. This phenomenon was diminished by acidification of the feed. The experimental results showed that the permeate flux and the quality of obtained distillate kept stable before concentration factor reached 5.0 with the acidified groundwater as feed. The membrane module efficiency began to decline gradually when the feed continued to be concentrated, which can be mainly attributed to the formation of CaF2 deposits on the membrane surface.

{"title": "Lead identification and optimization in crude samples using label free resonant acoustic profiling.", "abstract": "Detecting the molecular basis of protein-protein recognition is an essential element in understanding protein function because their ability to form specific complexes with other proteins underlies most cellular processes. The use of labels has limitations, such as changes to the binding kinetics due to the alterations in structure and function that occur with label addition, difficulty in detecting biochemical activities and the need for additional steps in assay development. These issues have driven the development of label-free formats for identifying the full range of biochemical activities. Although optical-based systems dominate the label-free biosensor market, electrochemical, piezoelectric and acoustic devices represent similar but significantly less expensive alternatives. Acoustic biosensors have been employed in the label-free detection of an incredibly broad range of analytes, from interfacial chemistries and lipid membranes, to small molecules and whole cells. Resonant acoustic profiling (RAP) technology offers label-free, real-time analysis of biomolecular interactions and offers an efficient way to optimize the development and production process of recombinant proteins. RAP measures only the physical binding events and is insensitive to refractive index and colour changes. This enables direct measurement in undiluted crude and complex samples, such as cell culture media or periplasmic extracts, without intensive assay calibration. This advantage simplifies experimental design and eliminates expensive time-consuming purification of often limited material, while delivering high content information. In this respect RAP technology reduces costs and increases the throughput and the density of information to optimize and control the processes more effectively.", "journal": "Journal of molecular recognition : JMR", "date": "2010-06-16", "authors": ["Helge RSchnerr"], "doi": "10.1002/jmr.1057"}

{"title": "Reflector-based phase calibration of ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "Recently, the measurement of phase transfer functions (PTFs) of piezoelectric transducers has received more attention. These PTFs are useful for e.g. coding and interference based imaging methods, and ultrasound contrast microbubble research. Several optical and acoustic methods to measure a transducer's PTF have been reported in literature. The optical methods require a setup to which not all ultrasound laboratories have access to. The acoustic methods require accurate distance and acoustic wave speed measurements. A small error in these leads to a large error in phase, e.g. an accuracy of 0.1% on an axial distance of 10cm leads to an uncertainty in the PTF measurement of \u00b197\u00b0 at 4MHz. In this paper we present an acoustic pulse-echo method to measure the PTF of a transducer, which is based on linear wave propagation and only requires an estimate of the wave travel distance and the acoustic wave speed. In our method the transducer is excited by a monofrequency sine burst with a rectangular envelope. The transducer initially vibrates at resonance (transient regime) prior to the forcing frequency response (steady state regime).

{"title": "Preliminary report: biomechanics of vertebral artery segments C1-C6 during cervical spinal manipulation.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to measure strains in the human vertebral artery (VA) within the cervical transverse foramina and report the first results on the mechanical loading of segments of the VA during spinal manipulation of the cervical spine.\nEight piezoelectric ultrasound crystals of 0.5-mm diameter were sutured into the lumen of the left and right VA of one cadaver. Four hundred-nanosecond ultrasound pulses were sent between the crystals to measure the instantaneous lengths of the VA segments (total segments n = 14) at a frequency of 200 Hz. Vertebral artery engineering strains were then calculated from the instantaneous lengths during cervical spinal range of motion testing, chiropractic cervical spinal manipulation adjustments, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency testing.\nThe results of this study suggest complex and nonintuitive strain patterns of the VA within the cervical transverse foramina. Consistent (for 2 chiropractors) and repeatable (for 3 repeat measurements for each chiropractor) elongation and shortening of adjacent VA segments were observed simultaneously and could not be explained with a simple model of neck movement. We hypothesized that they were caused by variations in the location and stiffness of the VA fascial attachments to the vertebral foramina and by coupled movements of the cervical vertebrae. However, in agreement with previous work on VA strains proximal and distal to the cervical transverse foramina, strains for cervical spinal manipulations were consistently lower than those obtained for cervical rotation.\nAlthough general conclusions should not be drawn from these preliminary results, the findings of this study suggest that textbook mechanics of the VA may not hold, that VA strains may not be predictable from neck movements alone, and that fascial connections within the transverse foramina and coupled vertebra movements may play a crucial role in VA mechanics during neck manipulation. Furthermore, the engineering strains during cervical spinal manipulations were lower than those obtained during range of motion testing, suggesting that neck manipulations impart stretches on the VA that are well within the normal physiologic range of neck motion.", "journal": "Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics", "date": "2010-06-11", "authors": ["SarahWuest", "BruceSymons", "TimothyLeonard", "WalterHerzog"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmpt.2010.03.007"}

Imaging was performed on a clinical 1.5 Tesla scanner, using conventional balanced gradient echo sequences (SSFP), T2*-weighted sequences, and IRON-imaging. In vitro experiments were conducted in an agarose phantom.

Using IRON, the mesh was clearly exhibited hyperintensely with suppression of on-resonant background signals with a distinct differentiation to other sources of off-resonances. Concentrations of approximately 9 mg/g led to best positive contrast and highest contrast-to-noise-ratios using IRON. Depending on B0-orientation, phase encoding direction and the STI's SPIO-load, the IRON-signal showed a characteristic pattern and an overestimation of STI size up to 4.6 mm.\nThe integration of SPIOs into the base material combined with IRON is a feasible approach to visualize STI with MRI.

In this paper, noncontact transportation of small particles around a circular trajectory was investigated. A circular aluminum plate with a piezoelectric ring was employed as a vibrating plate. On the basis of finite element analysis (FEA) calculations, the electrodes of the piezoelectric ring were divided into 24 pieces to generate a flexural vibration mode with one nodal circle and four nodal lines at the resonance frequency of 47.8 kHz. A circular plate having the same dimensions as the vibrating plate was installed parallel to the vibrator. It was used as a reflector to generate an acoustic standing wave in the air between the two plates. The acoustic field between the vibrating plate and reflector was calculated by FEA and the distribution of the acoustic radiation force acting on a small rigid particle was calculated to predict the position of the trapped particle. Using a prototype of the vibrating plate, polystyrene particles with diameters of several millimeters could be trapped at regular intervals along the horizontal nodal line of the standing wave. The sound pressure distribution between the vibrating plate and reflector was measured by a fiber optic probe and the experimental and calculated results showed good agreement.

Charged-coupled device (CCD) laser displacement sensors, strobe lighting technique, laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high fidelity piezoelectric pressure transducers measured impact velocities, cavitation images, squeeze flow velocities, vortices, and pressure changes at impact, respectively. The movable rods created cavitation at critical impact velocities of 1.6 and 1.2\u00a0m/s; squeeze flow velocities were 2.8 and 4.64\u00a0m/s. The isolated water hammer created cavitation at 1.3\u00a0m/s piston speed. The combined piston and stationary rod created cavitation at an impact speed of 0.9\u00a0m/s and squeeze flow of 3.2\u00a0m/s. These results show squeeze flow alone caused cavitation, notably at lower impact velocity as contact area increased. Water hammer alone also caused cavitation with faster displacement. Both effects together were additive. The pressure change at the vortex center was only 150\u00a0mmHg, which cannot generate the magnitude of pressure drop required for cavitation bubble formation. Cavitation occurred at 3-5\u00a0m/s squeeze flow, significantly different from the 14\u00a0m/s derived by Bernoulli's equation; the temporal acceleration of unsteady flow requires further study.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2010-05-22", "authors": ["Chi-WenLo", "Sheng-FuChen", "Chi-PeiLi", "Po-ChienLu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-010-0070-y"}

A 10MHz AT-cut shear-thickness-mode bulk-acoustic-wave quartz crystal resonator with Pt film electrodes was used as the signal transducer. Adenine electrooxidation was prevented by the barrier film. The MIP film was deposited by electrochemical co-polymerization of two functional monomers of bis(bithiophene) derivatives, bearing either the 18-crown-6 or dioxaborinane substituent, in the presence of the adenine template. A strong base solution was then used to extract the template. Completeness of the template removal was substantiated by the UV-vis, XPS, DPV, and EIS measurements. The chemosensor performance was evaluated with the piezoelectric microgravimetry detection at QCM under FIA conditions using a carrier acetonitrile-water (1:1, v:v) mixed solvent solution. The linear dynamic concentration range extended from at least 0.1 to 1mM for the 35 microL/min flow rate, and 100 microL volume of the injected adenine solution. The chemosensor selectivity allowed for discrimination of the adenine analyte from structurally and functionally related interferants, such as 2-aminopurine, guanine, and ascorbic acid.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that in the bulk of the PVDF/OMMT precursor OMMT platelets are homogeneously dispersed in PVDF and can be both intercalated and exfoliated. It is found that the diameter of the PVDF/OMMT composite nanofibers is smaller than that of the neat PVDF fibers because the lower viscosity of PVDF/OMMT solution, which is attributed to the possible adsorption of PVDF chains on OMMT layers and thus reduction in number of entanglement. The crystal structure of the composite nanofibers was investigated using WAXD and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and compared with that of thin film samples. The results show that the nonpolar alpha phase is completely absent in the electrospun PVDF/OMMT composite nanofibers, whereas it is still present in the neat PVDF electrospun fibers and in the thin films of PVDF/OMMT nanocomposites. The cooperative effect between electrospinning and nanoclay on formation of polar beta and gamma crystalline phases in PVDF is discussed. The IR result reveals that electrospinning induces formation of long trans conformation, whereas OMMT platelets can retard relaxation of PVDF chains and stabilize such conformation due to the possible interaction between the PVDF chains and OMMT layers.

Electrical activation of the LV of pigs (n = 10, 30-35 kg) was achieved by pacing (150 beats/min) at left atrial and LV sites such that normal atrioventricular activation (60 min) was followed by regional early LV activation for 60 min within 1.5 cm of the paced site and restoration of normal atrioventricular pacing for 120 min. Regional shortening (piezoelectric crystals) and interstitial MMP activity (microdialysis with MMP fluorogenic substrate) at the LV pacing site and a remote LV site were monitored at 30-min intervals. During aberrant electrical stimulation, interstitial MMP activity at the paced site was increased (122 +/- 4%) compared with the remote region (100%, P < 0.05). Restoration of atrioventricular pacing after the 60-min period of aberrant electrical activation normalized segmental shortening (8.5 +/- 0.4%), but MMP activity remained elevated (121 +/- 6%, P < 0.05).

The purpose of this effort is to develop a device to precisely control deflection of tissue while measuring interface loads within an MRI bore. Displacement of a tissue sample is provided via a non-ferromagnetic linear piezoelectric motor mounted on an aluminum sliding stage. A software program is developed to synchronize and gate the motor motion with the pulse sequence of the MRI using signals sent by the MRI controller. The piezoelectric motor has submicron position precision with closed loop encoder control allowing for accurate control. The motor encoder relays position data to the motor control software which is used to calculate the deflection, velocity, strain, and strain rate. An end effecter is mounted to the motor stage and transmits load to the tissue. The end effecter will contain a single axis load cell to record the compression force during displacement. Tissue samples are contained within an acrylic container and immersed in saline solution. The motor stage and container are mounted on a stack of sliding platforms that allow the user to easily move the motor stage and end indenter relative to the container or the motor stage, end effecter, and container relative to the MRI head coil. These degrees of freedom provide the user a means for quick and easy test setup. The device will measure strain, strain rate, and load in time.

However, most piezoelectric actuators are made of piezoceramics which have a major drawback related to their natural hysteresis nonlinearity. To compensate the hysteresis nonlinearity of piezoelectric actuators, many hysteresis models have been proposed such as the Preisach model, the classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, and so on. This paper provides a new approach to model the asymmetric hysteresis nonlinearity of piezoelectric actuators. Unlike the classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, the proposed model is based on a combination of two asymmetric operators which can independently simulate the ascending branch and descending branch of hysteresis. Moreover, the proposed model can be calculated using the recursive least-squares method and this makes the model easy and convenient to be calculated. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing its simulation results with experimental measurements.

A second analytical or numerical simulation is therefore often required to calculate the pressure field in the propagating medium (typically water) to deduce many important characteristics of the transducer, such as spatial resolutions and side lobe levels. This is why a hybrid algorithm was developed, combining finite- difference and pseudo-spectral methods in the case of 2-D configurations to simulate accurately both the generation of acoustic waves by the piezoelectric transducer and their propagation in the surrounding media using a single model. The algorithm was redefined in this study to take all three dimensions into account and to model single-element transducers, which usually present axisymmetrical geometry. This method was validated through comparison of its results with those of finite-element software, and was used to simulate the behavior of planar and lens-focused transducers. A high-frequency (30 MHz) transducer based on a screen-printed piezoelectric thick film was fabricated and characterized.

Experimental results demonstrated that focused second harmonic pressures could be controlled to occur at specific depths by controlling the f-number of the transducer. The experimental results were in good agreement with the modeled results. Experiments were conducted using three imaging modalities: fundamental 20 MHz (F20), second harmonic 40 MHz (H40), and fundamental 40 MHz (F40).

However, with D. melanogaster our knowledge of the behavioral activity of olfactory receptor ligands has relied largely on close-range attraction, rather than on long-range orientation behavior. We developed a flight assay to relate chemosensory perception to behavior. Headspace volatiles from vinegar attracted 62% of assayed flies during a 15-min experimental period. Flies responded irrespective of age, sex, and mating state, provided they had been starved. To identify behaviorally relevant chemicals from vinegar, we compared the responses to vinegar and synthetic chemicals. Stimuli were applied by a piezoelectric sprayer at known and constant release rates. Re-vaporized methanol extracts of Super Q-trapped vinegar volatiles attracted as many flies as vinegar. The main volatile component of vinegar, acetic acid, elicited significant attraction as a single compound. Two other vinegar volatiles, 2-phenyl ethanol and acetoin, produced a synergistic effect when added to acetic acid. Geosmin, a microbiological off-flavor, diminished attraction to vinegar.

For materials intended for Reinke's space, ramifications of property values are of great concern because of their impact on ease of voice onset. Our objectives were: 1) to measure viscoelastic properties of a new nonresorbing carbomer and well-known vocal fold injectables at vocalization frequencies using established and new instrumentation, and 2) to predict phonation threshold pressures using a computer model with intended placement in Reinke's space.\nRheology and phonation threshold pressure calculations.\nInjectables were evaluated with a traditional rotational rheometer and a new piezo-rotary vibrator. Using these data at vocalization frequencies, phonation threshold pressures (PTP) were calculated for each biomaterial, assuming a low dimensional model with supraglottic coupling and adjusted vocal fold length and thickness at each frequency. Results were normalized to a nominal PTP value.\nViscoelastic data were acquired at vocalization frequencies as high as 363 to 1,400 Hz for six new carbomer hydrogels, Hylan B, and Extracel intended for vocal fold Reinke's space injection and for Cymetra (lateral injection). Reliability was confirmed with good data overlap when measuring with either rheometer. PTP predictions ranged from 0.001 to 16 times the nominal PTP value of 0.283 kPa.\nAccurate viscoelastic measurements of vocal fold injectables are now possible at physiologic frequencies. Hylan B, Extracel, and the new carbomer hydrogels should generate easy vocal onset and sustainable vocalization based on their rheologic properties if injected into Reinke's space.

As is found to be not uncommon, many real systems are subject to the constraints which are described by the non-smooth functions such as absolute value function. The non-smooth and nonlinear nature poses significant challenges to the modeling and control work. To overcome these difficulties, a novel idea proposed in this work is to use a scalar sign function approach to effectively transform the original nonlinear and non-smooth model into a smooth nonlinear rational function model. Upon the resulting smooth model, a systematic digital controller design procedure is established, in which an optimal linearization method, LQR design and digital implementation through an advanced digital redesign technique are sequentially applied.

The DCMD experimental results indicated that the feed concentration had no significant influence on the permeate flux and the rejection of solute. When natural groundwater was used directly as the feed, the precipitation of CaCO(3) would be formed and clog the hollow fibre inlets with gradual concentration of the feed, which resulted in a rapid decline of the module efficiency. The negative influence of scaling could be eliminated by acidification of the feed. Finally, a 250 h DCMD continuous desalination experiment of acidified groundwater with the concentration factor at constant 4.0 was carried out. The permeate flux kept stable and the permeate conductivity was less than 7.0 microS cm(-1) during this process. Furthermore, there was no deposit observed on the membrane surface.

A training set was used to assess signal processing, and a validation set was used to verify its accuracy. A peak detection algorithm was developed to quantify flight time from the acceleration modulus, and its results were compared with platform data. The Pearson correlation coefficient of ankle accelerations and the integral of each signal were adopted to describe, respectively, the movement coordination and the limbs rotation during the flight time. The flight times obtained from the accelerometers and force plate were highly correlated (Spearman's coefficient >0.95); they were compared, for each jump, and the maximum mean error, for subject, was 4.8%. The movement coordination was in good agreement with subjects' clinical features and with the different jump phases. The signal integral presented significant differences, among jumps, related to leg rotations (p < 0.0005).

Mild alerting stimuli produced stereotyped tachypnoeic responses, without affecting heart rate: tapping the chamber raised respiratory rate from 117+/-7 to 430+/-15 cpm; sudden side move--from 134+/-13 to 487+/-16 cpm, and turning on lights--from 136+/-12 to 507+/-14 cpm (n=10; p<0.01 for all; no inter-strain differences). We conclude that: i) sniffing is an integral part of the generalized arousal response and does not depend on the modality of sensory stimuli; ii) tachypnoea is a sensitive index of arousal; and iii) respiratory rate is tightly correlated with motor activity.", "journal": "Physiology & behavior", "date": "2010-04-14", "authors": ["Muammar MKabir", "Mirza IBeig", "MathiasBaumert", "MimosaTrombini", "FrancescaMastorci", "AndreaSgoifo", "Frederick RWalker", "Trevor ADay", "EugeneNalivaiko"], "doi": "10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.04.004"}

Most of the current research activities refer to classical piezoelectric ceramic materials, but more recently the development of electrostrictive polymers has generated novel opportunities for high-strain actuators. At present, the investigation of using electrostrictive polymers for energy harvesting (a conversion of mechanical to electrical energy) is beginning to show potential for this application. This paper discusses the development of a model that is able to predict the energy harvesting capabilities of an electrostrictive polymer composite (EPC). An equivalent electrical scheme has been developed by using the model of current that was recently developed by our group.

Jerk-cost measuring systems have thus far been unable to determine the jerk-cost of each chewing phase over time. The purposes of this study were (i) to develop a new method for measuring momentary jerk-cost of the jaw movement using a small triaxial piezoelectric accelerometer and (ii) to test the hypothesis that the lowest smoothness is seen during jaw-opening phase. The accelerometer was attached to the skin of the mentum of each subject. Vertical jaw displacement, acceleration, the jerk, and the time differential of jerk-cost during gum chewing were analysed as a function of time in five normal dentate subjects (n = 5). The system revealed intra-class correlation coefficients of intra-examiner, inter-examiner, and test-retest consistency of substantially high values (0.80-0.88). In all subjects, the highest jerk-cost was observed in the opening phase of each chewing cycle when the gum was parting from the teeth; the lowest jerk-cost was observed in the intercuspal phase throughout the chewing cycle, thus confirming the hypothesis. Significant differences were observed between the opening, closing, and intercuspal chewing phases (N = 5, P = 0.007).

Our study focused on the effect of different solvents on the morphology of PVDF wrapping on SWCNTs. Three organic solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) were chosen for PVDF. When DMSO was used as solvent, the decorating degree of PVDF on the surface of SWCNTs increases significantly with the increase of SC CO(2) pressure, and nanocrystals wrapping on SWCNTs can be observed at high pressure. FTIR and Raman spectra indicated that there exist interactions between SWCNTs and PVDF chains. What's more, FTIR results also show that there exists a transformation from the beta-phase to the alpha-phase of PVDF in DMSO with the assistance of SC CO(2), which is similar to the action of elongation/shear flow field. It indicated that the alpha-phase is the predominant form occurring on the surface of SWCNTs after treatment with SC CO(2). And the helical structure on SWCNTs observed from the TEM image reflected the alternate trans- and gauche-bond conformation of the alpha-form. When DMF or DMAc was used as the solvent, although nanocrystal wrapping and helical structure was not visible, the samples had more excellent dispersion than that in DMSO. Particularly, for DMF, a typical network structure was observed, which is similar to a spider web. Therefore, this work supplies a clue that the various morphologies of nanohybrid structure can be obtained just by changing the solvent during the treatment process of SC CO(2), and accordingly, the tailored nanohybrid structure are promising and important for functional design as a basic component in microfabrication and other fields.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Scanning electron microscopy and capillary flow analyses verified that the fiber mats had an average fiber diameter of 970 +/- 480 nm and a mean pore diameter of 1.7 microm, respectively. Thermally stimulated depolarization current spectroscopy measurements confirmed the piezoelectric property of the PVDF-TrFE fibrous scaffolds by the generation of a spontaneous current with the increase in temperature in the absence of an electric field, which was not detected in the unprocessed PVDF-TrFE powder. Differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that the electrospinning process increased the crystallinity and presence of the polar, beta-phase crystal compared with the unprocessed powder. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and a cell proliferation assay demonstrated spreading and increased cell numbers (human skin fibroblasts) over time on PVDF-TrFE scaffolds, which was comparable with tissue culture polystyrene.

The advantage of the self-sensing cantilever is its simplicity, particularly its simple structure. It can be used for the construction of an atomic force microscopy system with a vacuum, fluids, and a low temperature chamber. Additionally, the self-actuating cantilever can be used for a high speed scanning system because the bandwidth is larger than the bulk scanner. Frequently, ZnO film has been used as an actuator in a self-actuating cantilever. In this paper, we studied the characteristics of the self-sensing and self-actuating cantilever with an integrated Wheatstone bridge circuit substituting the ZnO film with a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) film as the actuator. We can reduce the leakage current (to less than 10(-4) A/cm(2)) in the PZT cantilever and improve sensor sensitivity through a reduction of noise level from the external sensor circuit using the Wheatstone bridge circuit embedded into the cantilever. The self-sensing and actuating cantilever with an integrated Wheatstone bridge circuit was compared with a commercial self-sensing cantilever or self-sensing and actuating cantilever without an integrated Wheatstone bridge circuit. The measurement results have shown that sensing the signal to noise level and the minimum detectable deflection improved to 4.78 mV and 1.18 nm, respectively.

Preliminary measurements using two passive cavitation detectors (megahertz-frequency focused and unfocused piezoelectric transducers) installed in a mercury test target to monitor cavitation generated by proton beams with charges ranging from 0.041 to 4.1 muC will be reported on. Cavitation was initially detected for a beam charge of 0.082 muC by the presence of an acoustic emission approximately 250 mus after arrival of the incident proton beam. This emission was consistent with an inertial cavitation collapse of a bubble with an estimated maximum bubble radius of 0.19 mm, based on collapse time. The peak pressure in the mercury for the initiation of cavitation was predicted to be 0.6 MPa. For a beam charge of 0.41 muC and higher, the lifetimes of the bubbles exceeded the reverberation time of the chamber ( approximately 300 mus), and distinct windows of cavitation activity were detected, a phenomenon that likely resulted from the interaction of the reverberation in the chamber and the cavitation bubbles.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2010-04-08", "authors": ["Nicholas JManzi", "Parag VChitnis", "R GlynnHolt", "Ronald ARoy", "Robin OCleveland", "BernieRiemer", "MarkWendel"], "doi": "10.1121/1.3353095"}

{"title": "Actuating mechanism and design of a cylindrical traveling wave ultrasonic motor using cantilever type composite transducer.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic motors (USM) are based on the concept of driving the rotor by a mechanical vibration excited on the stator via piezoelectric effect. USM exhibit merits such as simple structure, quick response, quiet operation, self-locking when power off, nonelectromagnetic radiation and higher position accuracy.\nA cylindrical type traveling wave ultrasonic motor using cantilever type composite transducer was proposed in this paper. There are two cantilevers on the outside surface of cylinder, four longitudinal PZT ceramics are set between the cantilevers, and four bending PZT ceramics are set on each outside surface of cantilevers. Two degenerate flexural vibration modes spatially and temporally orthogonal to each other in the cylinder are excited by the composite transducer. In this new design, a single transducer can excite a flexural traveling wave in the cylinder. Thus, elliptical motions are achieved on the teeth. The actuating mechanism of proposed motor was analyzed. The stator was designed with FEM. The two vibration modes of stator were degenerated. Transient analysis was developed to gain the vibration characteristic of stator, and results indicate the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are nearly ellipses.\nThe study results verify the feasibility of the proposed design. The wave excited in the cylinder isn't an ideal traveling wave, and the vibration amplitudes are inconsistent. The distortion of traveling wave is generated by the deformation of bending vibration mode of cylinder, which is caused by the coupling effect between the cylinder and transducer. Analysis results also prove that the objective motions of nodes on the teeth are three-dimensional vibrations. But, the vibration in axial direction is minute compared with the vibrations in circumferential and radial direction.

We subsequently show how such a device can be used in the field of mass spectrometry (MS) detection, demonstrating that SAW nebulization (SAWN) can be performed either in a discontinuous or pulsed mode, similar to that for matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) or in a continuous mode like electrospray ionization (ESI). We present data showing the transfer of peptides to the gas phase, where ions are detected by MS. These peptide ions were subsequently fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, from which the sequence was assigned. Unlike MALDI mass spectra, which are typically contaminated with matrix ions at low m/z, the SAWN generated spectra had no such interference. In continuous mode, the SAWN plume was sampled on a microsecond time scale by a linear ion trap mass spectrometer and produced multiply charged peptide precursor ions with a charge state distribution shifted to higher m/z compared to an identical sample analyzed by ESI. The SAWN technology also provides the opportunity to re-examine a sample from a flat surface, repeatedly. The process can be performed without the need for capillaries, which can clog, reservoirs, which dilute the sample, and electrodes, which when in direct contact with sample, cause unwanted electrochemical oxidation. In both continuous and pulsed sampling modes, the quality of precursor ion scans and tandem mass spectra of peptides was consistent across the plume's lifetime.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2010-04-07", "authors": ["Scott RHeron", "RabWilson", "Scott AShaffer", "David RGoodlett", "Jonathan MCooper"], "doi": "10.1021/ac100372c"}

Several tens of whiskers (or vibrissae) are distributed in a regular manner on both sides of the snout. Many tactile discrimination tasks using this system need multiple contacts with more than one whisker to be solved. With the aim of mimicking those multi-whisker stimuli during electrophysiological recordings, we developed a novel mechanical stimulator composed of 24 independent multi-directional piezoelectric benders adapted to the five rows and the five caudal arcs of the rat whisker pad. The most widely used technology for producing mechanical deflections of the whiskers is based on piezoelectric benders that display a non-linear behavior when driven with high frequency input commands and, if not compensated, show high unwanted ringing at particular resonance frequencies. If not corrected, this non-linear behavior precludes the application of high frequency deflections and the study of cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. To cope with the ringing problem, a mechanical and a software based solutions have been developed. With these corrections, the upper bound of the linear range of the bender is increased to 1 kHz.

The measured extension in the transverse direction was proportional to the intensity of the applied electric field and amounted to 0.0278% on average at a field intensity of 1 MV m(-1), which results in a piezoelectric charge constant of 278 pm V(-1). At the nanoscale, changes in the cellulose crystallites due to the applied electric field were studied by means of wide-angle X-ray diffraction using the same specimens as in macroscopic experiments.

A typical approximately 1 pW output power for a device of a approximately 1 mm2 area and a density of approximately 10(7)/mm2 nanowires can be obtained. In order to reach the approximately 10 nW power needed to operate a nanodevice, nanogenerators of this kind need to be optimized. With the aim of fabricating low cost to efficiency ratio nanogenerators, we have considered ZnO films grown by an electrochemical technique, based on the direct precipitation of Zn hydroxide on a conducting ITO/glass substrate and subsequent heat treatment, and TiO2 films deposited from a colloidal suspension of anatase/rutile commercial powders.

Here, we demonstrate the vertical and lateral integration of ZnO nanowires into arrays that are capable of producing sufficient power to operate real devices. A lateral integration of 700 rows of ZnO nanowires produces a peak voltage of 1.26 V at a low strain of 0.19%, which is potentially sufficient to recharge an AA battery.

To prevent skin damage, we designed a new piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensor.\nTo assess the potential of the PZT sensor for cardiorespiratory monitoring in the NICU.\nThe PZT sensor was placed under a folded towel under a neonate to detect an acoustic cardiorespiratory signal, from which heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) were calculated, together with simultaneous ECG/IPG recording for 1-9 days for long and brief (1-min) assessment.\nThe brief assessment showed average correlation coefficients of 0.92 +/- 0.12 and 0.95 +/- 0.02 between instantaneous HRs/BRs detected by the PZT sensor and ECG/IPG in 27 and 11 neonates examined. During the long assessment, the HR detection rate by the PZT sensor was approximately 10% lower than that by ECG (82.6 +/- 12.9 vs. 91.8 +/- 4.1%; p = 0.001, n = 27), although comparable (90.3 +/- 4.1 vs. 92.5 +/- 3.4%, p = 0.081) in approximately 70% (18/27) of neonates examined; BR detection rate was comparable between the PZT sensor and IPG during relatively stable signal conditions (95.9 +/- 4.0 vs. 95.3 +/- 3.5%; p = 0.38, n = 11). The PZT sensor caused neither skin damage nor body movement increase in all neonates examined.\nThe PZT sensor is noninvasive and does not cause skin irritation, and we believe it does provide a reliable, accurate cardiorespiratory monitoring tool for use in the NICU, although the issue of mechanical-ventilation noise remains to be solved.", "journal": "Neonatology", "date": "2010-03-18", "authors": ["ShinichiSato", "WakoIshida-Nakajima", "AkiraIshida", "MasanariKawamura", "ShinobuMiura", "KyoichiOno", "NobuyaInagaki", "GoroTakada", "TsutomuTakahashi"], "doi": "10.1159/000283994"}

{"title": "Fabrication of an olfactometer for mosquito behavioural studies.", "abstract": "Olfaction is the major sensory modality involved in the resource searching behaviour of insects including vector mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). To date, our current countrywide knowledge on the host-seeking behaviour of Iranian mosquitoes is mainly confined to host preference which has exclusively come from field studies. Olfactometer is a scientific tool by which more naive aspects of man-vector contact can be clarified under controlled and less biased conditions.\nThe wind tunnel and stimulus delivery system was constructed from acrylic materials based on previously introduced models with some modifications. Air supply and required light were ensured by a powerful compressor and incandescent bulbs, respectively. Desired level of temperature was maintained by controllable heating radiators. For humidity production a unique in-built piezo system was devised in the course of the air flow. Fine regulators facilitated the continuous generatation of the humidity at a preset level.\nTitanium tetrachloride smoke plus monitoring of the wind speed revealed that the flow of air was proper and invariable. A desired level of humidity and temperature could be set up in just 10 and 15-45 min, respectively. These physical parameters varied only +/-2% (humidity) and +/-0.15 degrees C (temperature) in a typical 20 min duration.\nThe first sophisticated olfactometer in the field of medical entomology in Iran is reported here.

{"title": "Molecular recognition imaging using tuning fork-based transverse dynamic force microscopy.", "abstract": "We demonstrate simultaneous transverse dynamic force microscopy and molecular recognition imaging using tuning forks as piezoelectric sensors. Tapered aluminum-coated glass fibers were chemically functionalized with biotin and anti-lysozyme molecules and attached to one of the prongs of a 32kHz tuning fork. The lateral oscillation amplitude of the tuning fork was used as feedback signal for topographical imaging of avidin aggregates and lysozyme molecules on mica substrate. The phase difference between the excitation and detection signals of the tuning fork provided molecular recognition between avidin/biotin or lysozyme/anti-lysozyme. Aggregates of avidin and lysozyme molecules appeared as features with heights of 1-4nm in the topographic images, consistent with single molecule atomic force microscopy imaging. Recognition events between avidin/biotin or lysozyme/anti-lysozyme were detected in the phase image at high signal-to-noise ratio with phase shifts of 1-2 degrees.

{"title": "Novel low-power ultrasound digital preprocessing architecture for wireless display.", "abstract": "A complete hardware-based ultrasound preprocessing unit (PPU) is presented as an alternative to available power-hungry devices. Intended to expand the ultrasonic applications, the proposed unit allows replacement of the cable of the ultrasonic probe by a wireless link to transfer data from the probe to a remote monitor. The digital back-end architecture of this PPU is fully pipelined, which permits sampling of ultrasonic signals at a frequency equal to the field-programmable gate array-based system clock, up to 100 MHz. Experimental results show that the proposed processing unit has an excellent performance, an equivalent 53.15 Dhrystone 2.1 MIPS/ MHz (DMIPS/MHz), compared with other software-based architectures that allow a maximum of 1.6 DMIPS/MHz. In addition, an adaptive subsampling method is proposed to operate the pixel compressor, which allows real-time image zooming and, by removing high-frequency noise, the lateral and axial resolutions are enhanced by 25% and 33%, respectively. Realtime images, acquired from a reference phantom, validated the feasibility of the proposed architecture. For a display rate of 15 frames per second, and a 5-MHz single-element piezoelectric transducer, the proposed digital PPU requires a dynamic power of only 242 mW, which represents around 20% of the best-available software-based system.

{"title": "Simple frequency-based sensing of viscosity and dielectric properties of a liquid using acoustic resonators.", "abstract": "The effects of a finite polarizability of a liquid sample onto the series resonance frequency of a piezoelectric resonator are described within the small-load approximation. It is found that the sample's electrical capacitance (the ratio of surface potential and surface polarization at the crystal surface) enters the motional branch of the equivalent circuit, thereby shifting the series resonance frequency. This effect is caused by piezoelectric stiffening. Using a conventional quartz crystal with small hole in the front electrode and exposing this crystal to a variety of different liquids, we demonstrate that derived equation describes the experiment reasonably well. Electric and dielectric effects are particularly strong for torsional resonators, which operate at a frequency of around 56 kHz. These are in commercial use for determination of the viscosity of engine oils. We propose a simple method to in situ switch the strength of piezoelectric stiffening. It allows separation of the viscoelastic parameters from the electric polarizability. It could, for instance, be used to differentiate between gasoline and water being accidentally admitted to the lubricant reservoir.

Both polarized hydroxyapatite (HA), whose surface charge is not dependent on loading, and piezoelectric ceramics, which produce electrical potentials under stress, have been studied in order to determine the possible benefits of using electrically active bioceramics as implant materials. The polarization of HA has a positive influence on interfacial responses to the ceramic. In vivo studies of polarized HA have shown polarized samples to induce improvements in bone ingrowth. The majority of piezoelectric ceramics proposed for implant use contain barium titanate (BaTiO(3)). In vivo and in vitro investigations have indicated that such ceramics are biocompatible and, under appropriate mechanical loading, induce improved bone formation around implants. The mechanism by which electrical activity influences biological responses is yet to be clearly defined, but is likely to result from preferential adsorption of proteins and ions onto the polarized surface.

{"title": "Improved pyroelectric detectors for single crystal adsorption calorimetry from 100 to 350 K.", "abstract": "The adsorption of atoms and molecules on single crystal surfaces allows one to produce well-characterized atomic, molecular, or dissociated adsorbates. Microcalorimetric measurement of the resulting adsorption energies, i.e., single crystal adsorption calorimetry, allows determination of the standard enthalpies of formation of these adsorbates. Methods are described for making an improved heat detector for such measurements, which greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly at low temperatures (down to 100 K). The heat detector is an adaptation of a previously introduced design, based on a metallized pyroelectric polymer (beta-polyvinylidene fluoride), which is pressed against the back of a single crystal during measurement but removed during sample preparation and annealing. The improvement is achieved by selectively etching the metal coating of the polymer, thus reducing the pyro- and piezoelectric noise from all nonessential regions of the polymer. We, furthermore, describe how to achieve a better thermal contact between the sample and the pyroelectric polymer, without increasing the thermal mass of the detector, resulting in significantly improved sensitivities for both 1 and 127 microm thick samples. The result is a detector which, using 1 microm samples, is approximately 40 times more sensitive at 100 K than the traditional polymer-based detector, showing a pulse-to-pulse standard deviation in the heat of adsorption of just 1.3 kJ/mol with gas pulses containing only 1.1% of a monolayer onto Pt(111), for which 1 ML (monolayer) is 1.5x10(15) species/cm(2). For measurements at 300 K, where especially pyroelectric noise is likely of less concern, the new design improves the sensitivity 3.6-fold compared to the traditional detector.

To understand the nutrition effect, a wool protein was coated on PVA and PCL nanofibres and incorporated into PVA nanofibres via coelectrospinning of a PVA solution containing the wool protein. Silver nanoparticles were also applied to PVA nanofibres to improve antibacterial activity. It was found that the wound healing performance is mainly influenced by the porosity, air permeability, and surface wettability of the nanofibre membranes. A nanofibre membrane with good hydrophilicity and high porosity considerably facilitates the healing of wound especially at the early healing stage. However, the fiber diameter and antibacterial activity have little effect on the wound healing efficiency.

All of the signals from each blot were assigned to a master map, and autoantigen candidates were defined based of the pattern of immunoreactivities. The corresponding proteins were isolated from preparative gels, identified by MALDI-MS and/or by nano-HPLC/ESI-MS/MS and exemplarily confirmed by duplex Western blotting combining the human serum samples with antibodies directed against the protein(s) of interest.\nFrom 281 secretome proteins stained with autoantibodies in total we first defined the \"background patterns\" of frequently immunoreactive extracellular proteins in healthy and diseased people. An assignment of these proteins, among them many nominally intracellular proteins, to the subset of exosomal proteins within the secretomes revealed a large overlap. On this basis we defined and consequently confirmed novel biomarker candidates such as the extreme C-terminus of the extracellular matrix protein agrin within the set of cancer-enriched immunoreactivities.\nOur findings suggest, first, that autoantibody responses may be due, in large part, to cross-presentation of antigens to the immune system via exosomes, membrane vesicles released by tumor cells and constituting a significant fraction of the secretome. In addition, this immunosecretomics approach has revealed novel biomarker candidates, some of them secretome-specific, and thus serves as a promising complementary tool to the frequently reported immunoproteomic studies for biomarker discovery.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2010-02-27", "authors": ["SusanneKlein-Scory", "SalwaK\u00fcbler", "HannaDiehl", "ChristinaEilert-Micus", "AnkeReinacher-Schick", "KaiSt\u00fchler", "BettinaWarscheid", "Helmut EMeyer", "WolffSchmiegel", "IrmgardSchwarte-Waldhoff"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-10-70\n10.1002/prca.200780012\n10.1002/prca.200780064\n10.1074/mcp.R600016-MCP200\n10.1021/pr0500814\n10.1196/annals.1381.024\n10.1016/j.canlet.2007.01.002\n10.1002/pmic.200500909\n10.1002/prca.200600491\n10.1034/j.1600-0854.2002.30502.x\n10.1016/j.ceb.2004.06.003\n10.1016/j.imlet.2006.09.005\n10.1093/jb/mvj128\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402237\n10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.04.001\n10.1038/85438\n10.1002/pmic.200401188\n10.1002/pmic.200401133\n10.1373/clinchem.2006.077370\n10.1002/pmic.200600066\n10.1074/mcp.M600465-MCP200\n10.1002/pmic.200700819\n10.1053/gast.2001.26263\n10.1038/nri2567\n10.1002/elps.11501601175\n10.1002/elps.1150090106\n10.1016/0165-022X(94)90020-5\n10.1002/pmic.200300703\n10.1021/ac991363o\n10.1021/ac00104a020\n10.1002/pmic.200300801\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(19991201)20:18<3551::AID-ELPS3551>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1002/pmic.200600294\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1819\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0520\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0267\n10.1002/pmic.200500346\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1315\n10.1021/pr070360m\n10.1038/nrm1074\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(200005)43:2<140::AID-NEU4>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1096/fj.07-8800com\n10.1038/sj.cr.7290088\n10.1074/mcp.M500042-MCP200\n10.1074/mcp.M700072-MCP200\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2009.01.005\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0749\n10.1038/sj.leu.2404296\n10.1016/j.humpath.2007.02.017"}

{"title": "Design study of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices for generation of higher electrical power using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method.", "abstract": "This paper presents a design study on the geometric parameters of a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices (EHD), which harvest energy from motion (vibration), for the purpose of scavenging more energy from ambient vibration energy sources. The design study is based on the coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method (CPCFEM), previously presented by Dr. Zhu. This model can calculate the power output of piezoelectric EHDS directly connected to a load resistor and is used in this paper to obtain the following simulation results for variations in geometric parameters such as the beam length, width and thickness, and the mass length, width, and height: 1) the current flowing through and the voltage developed across the load resistor, 2) the power dissipated by the resistor and the corresponding vibrational displacement amplitude, and 3) the resonant frequency. By studying these results, straightforward design strategies that enable the generation of more power are obtained for each geometric parameter, and a physical understanding of how each parameter affects the output power is given. It is suggested that, in designing with the aim of generating more power, the following strategies be used: 1) for the beam, a shorter length, larger width, and lower ratio of piezoelectric layer thickness to total beam thickness are preferred in the case of a fixed mass; 2) for the mass, a shortened mass length and a higher mass height are preferred in the case of variation in the mass length and the mass height with mass width and mass value remain fixed, and a wider width and small mass height are preferred in the case of variation in mass width and height (mass length and value remain fixed; and 3) for the case of a fixed total length, a shorter beam length and longer mass length are preferred. With the design strategies, output powers from the device can reach above 1 to 2 mW/cm(3), much higher than the 200 microW/cm(3) currently achieved in the published literature. This is an encouraging prospect for enabling a wider range of applications of the EHDs.

{"title": "Vibration energy harvesting based on integrated piezoelectric components operating in different modes.", "abstract": "To increase the vibration energy-harvesting capability of the piezoelectric generator based on a cantilever beam, we have proposed a piezoelectric generator that not only uses the strain change of piezoelectric components bonded on a cantilever beam, but also employs the weights at the tip of the cantilever beam to hit piezoelectric components located on the 2 sides of weights. A prototype of the piezoelectric generator has been fabricated and its characteristics have been measured and analyzed. The experimental results show that the piezoelectric components operating in the hit mode can substantially enhance the energy harvesting of the piezoelectric generator on a cantilever beam. Two methods are used and compared in the management of rectified output voltages from different groups of piezoelectric components. In one of them, the DC voltages from rectifiers are connected in series, and then the total DC voltage is applied to a capacitor. In another connection, the DC voltage from each group is applied to different capacitors. It is found that 22.3% of the harvested energy is wasted due to the series connection. The total output electric energy of our piezoelectric generator at nonresonance could be up to 43 nJ for one vibration excitation applied by spring, with initial vibration amplitude (0-p) of 18 mm and frequency of 18.5 Hz, when the rectified voltages from different groups of piezoelectric components are connected to their individual capacitors.

The tessellation of multiple building blocks permits formation of scalable 2-D macro-arrays of increased size and varying shape. This differs from conventional ultrasound solutions by integrating the entire system in a single module. No long RF cables are required to link the array elements to the electronics.

{"title": "Changes in plasma membrane structure and electromotile properties in prestin deficient outer hair cells.", "abstract": "Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) rapidly change their length and stiffness when their membrane potential is altered. Prestin, the motor protein for this electromotility, is present along the OHC lateral plasma membrane where there is a high density of intra-membrane protein particles (IMPs). However, it is not known to what extent prestin contributes to this unusual dense population of proteins and overall organization of the membrane to generate the unique electromechanical response of OHCs. We investigated the relationship of prestin with the IMPs, the underlying cortical cytoskeletal lattice, and electromotility in prestin-deficient mice. Using freeze-fracture, we observed a reduction in density and size of the IMPs that correlates with the reduction and absence of prestin in the heterozygous and homozygous mice, respectively. We also observed a reduction or absence of electromotility-related charge density, axial stiffness, and piezoelectric properties of the OHC. A comparison of the charge density with the number of IMPs suggests that prestin forms tetramers in the wild type but is likely to form lower number oligomers in the prestin-deficient OHCs from the heterozygous mice. Interestingly, the characteristic actin-based cortical cytoskeletal lattice that underlies the membrane is absent in the prestin-null OHCs, suggesting that prestin is also required for recruiting or maintaining the cortical cytoskeletal lattice. These results suggest that the majority of the IMPs are indeed prestin and that electrically evoked length and stiffness changes are interrelated and dependent on both prestin and on the cortical actin cytoskeletal lattice of the OHC lateral membrane.", "journal": "Cytoskeleton (Hoboken, N.J.)", "date": "2010-02-20", "authors": ["David Z ZHe", "ShupingJia", "TakashiSato", "JianZuo", "Leonardo RAndrade", "Gavin PRiordan", "BecharaKachar"], "doi": "10.1002/cm.20423"}
{"title": "Dye diffusion at surfaces: charge matters.", "abstract": "Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and single molecule burst analysis were used to measure the effects of glass surface interactions on the diffusion of two common fluorescent dyes, one cationic and one anionic. The effects of dye-surface interactions on measured diffusion rates as a function of distance from the surface were investigated. Use of a three-axis piezo stage, combined with reference calibration measurements, enabled the accurate acquisition of surface-distance-dependent transport data. This analysis reveals attractive interactions between the cationic dye and the surface, which significantly alter the extracted diffusion values and persist in the measurements up to 1.0 microm from the surface. The Coulomb attraction between the cationic dye and the surface also results in rare, long-lived association events that lead to irreproducibility in extracted diffusion values. In addition to an assignment of the association lifetime for these events, this paper demonstrates that, if experiments must be performed with cationic probes near a glass surface, the use of solution electrolytes can eliminate deleterious dye-surface interactions, as the dyes were tested in a variety of environments. Finally, our data demonstrate that a better dye choice is an anionic probe, which exhibits no depth dependence of diffusion characteristics above a glass surface.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2010-02-19", "authors": ["Charlisa RDaniels", "CarmenReznik", "Christy FLandes"], "doi": "10.1021/la904749z"}
{"title": "Measuring the local pressure amplitude in microchannel acoustophoresis.", "abstract": "A new method is reported on how to measure the local pressure amplitude and the Q factor of ultrasound resonances in microfluidic chips designed for acoustophoresis of particle suspensions. The method relies on tracking individual polystyrene tracer microbeads in straight water-filled silicon/glass microchannels. The system is actuated by a PZT piezo transducer attached beneath the chip and driven by an applied ac voltage near its eigenfrequency of 2 MHz. For a given frequency a number of particle tracks are recorded by a CCD camera and fitted to a theoretical expression for the acoustophoretic motion of the microbeads. From the curve fits we obtain the acoustic energy density, and hence the pressure amplitude as well as the acoustophoretic force. By plotting the obtained energy densities as a function of applied frequency, we obtain Lorentzian line shapes, from which the resonance frequency and the Q factor for each resonance peak are derived. Typical measurements yield acoustic energy densities of the order of 10 J/m(3), pressure amplitudes of 0.2 MPa, and Q factors around 500.

Membranes have been used as platforms for nanoparticle synthesis in order to reduce the agglomeration, encountered in solution phase synthesis which leads to a dramatic loss of reactivity. The membrane support, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was modified by in situ polymerization of acrylic acid in aqueous phase. Subsequent steps included ion exchange with Fe(2+), reduction to Fe(0) with sodium borohydride and Pd deposition. Various techniques, such as STEM, EDX, FTIR and permeability measurements, were used for membrane characterization and showed that bimetallic (Fe/Pd) nanoparticles with an average size of 20-30 nm have been incorporated inside of the PAA-coated membrane pores. The Fe/Pd-modified membranes showed a high reactivity toward a model compound, 2, 2'-dichlorobyphenyl and a strong dependence of degradation on Pd (hydrogenation catalyst) content. The use of convective flow substantially reduces the degradation time: 43% conversion of dichlorobiphenyl to biphenyl can be achieved in less than 40 s residence time.

By measuring nonlinear capacitance, the electrical signature of electromotility, we are able to assess prestin's conformational state and interrogate the effectiveness of anions on prestin's activity. We find that the affinity of anions depends on the state of prestin that we set with a variety of perturbations (in membrane tension, temperature, and voltage), and that movement into the expanded state reduces the affinity of prestin for anions. These data signify that anions work allosterically on prestin. Consequently, anions are released from prestin's binding site during expansion, i.e., during hyperpolarization. This is at odds with the extrinsic voltage sensor model, which suggests that prestin-bound intracellular anions are propelled deep into the membrane.

Measurements were taken twice in each direction: in the buccolingual direction from the buccal side and in the mesiodistal direction from the mesial side. The average of two measurements in each direction was regarded as the representative ISQ of that direction. The higher and lower values of the two ISQs (buccolingual and mesiodistal) were also classified separately. In addition, the variation in ISQ was quantified by subtracting the lower value from the higher value, and the implants were classified into two groups according to this variation: one with ISQ variation of 3 or more and the other with a variation of <3.\nThere were no differences between the two ISQs when measured from different directions, but there were significant differences between the higher and lower values of the ISQs at each measurement point. A significant difference was also observed between the two ISQ variation groups in the pattern of change of the lower value for the period from immediately after surgery to 10 weeks after surgery.\nAcquisition of two directional measurements and classification of the higher and lower values of the two directional ISQs may allow clinicians to detect patterns of change in ISQ that would not be identified if only one directional measurement were made.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2010-02-05", "authors": ["Jong-ChulPark", "Hyun-DuckKim", "Soung-MinKim", "Myung-JinKim", "Jong-HoLee"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0501.2009.01868.x"}

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators are particularly well suited to such applications as their resonance frequency is directly influenced by these perturbations, modifying both the phase velocity and resonance conditions. Moreover, the intrinsic radio frequency (rf) nature of these devices makes them ideal for wireless applications, mainly exploiting antennas reciprocity and piezoelectric reversibility. In this paper, we present a wireless SAW sensor interrogation unit operating in the 434 MHz centered ISM band--selected as a tradeoff between antenna dimensions and electromagnetic wave penetration in dielectric media--based on the principles of a frequency sweep network analyzer. We particularly focus on the compliance with the ISM standard which reveals complicated by the need for switching from emission to reception modes similarly to radar operation.

The nanoparticles are almost spherical showing a minimum size with 5% (w/w) PTMA concentration (PTMA5), and they become agglomerated at > or = 25% (w/w) PTMA concentration. Different phase separation mechanisms are used to explain the above variation of nanoparticle size. The lower size nanophase in the PTMA5 blend is attributed to spinodal decomposition, while the larger size nanophases are produced from binodal decomposition. The TGA study indicates increasing thermal stability of PVDF in the nanoblends. DSC study shows increasing melting and crystallization temperature of the nanoblends; the former is due to the attractive forces of PTMA nanostructure, and the latter is for the nucleating effect of nanophase PTMA. The long distance, lamellar distance, and amorphous overlayer distance decrease to different extents. The pi-pi* transition band of UV-vis spectra shows a red shift with increasing PTMA concentration, but the photoluminescence spectra of the nanoblends show a blue shift. The former is attributed to intrachain aggregation of PTMA, while the latter is caused from \"static excimer\" formation at the ground state. PTMA1 and PTMA3 show approximately 8 times increase in PL intensity except PTMA5 where interconnectivity between the nanodomains makes the nonradiative decay similar to bulk PTMA. The temperature variation of conductivity indicates a conformational transition of PTMA chain with increasing temperature facilitating better charge transport.

{"title": "Direct physical study of kinetochore-microtubule interactions by reconstitution and interrogation with an optical force clamp.", "abstract": "We detail our use of computer-controlled optical traps to study interactions between kinetochore components and dynamic microtubules. Over the last two decades optical traps have helped uncover the working principles of conventional molecular motors, such as kinesin and dynein, but only recently have they been applied to study kinetochore function. The most useful traps combine sensitive position detectors and servo-control, allowing them to be operated as force clamps that maintain constant loads on objects as they move. Our instrument, which is among the simplest designs that permits force clamping, relies on a computer-controlled piezoelectric stage and a single laser for trapping and position detection. We apply it in motility assays where beads coated with pure microtubule-binding kinetochore components are attached to the tips of individual dynamic microtubules. Like kinetochores in vivo, the beads remain tip-attached, undergoing movements coupled to filament assembly and disassembly. The force clamp provides many benefits over instruments that lack feedback control. It allows tension to be applied continuously during both assembly- and disassembly-driven movement, providing a close match to the physiological situation. It also enables tracking with high resolution, and simplifies data interpretation by eliminating artifacts due to molecular compliance. The formation of persistent, load-bearing attachments to dynamic microtubule tips is fundamental to all kinetochore activities. Our direct, physical study of kinetochore-microtubule coupling may therefore furnish insights into many vital kinetochore functions, including correction of aberrant attachments and generation of the 'wait-anaphase' signals that delay mitosis until all kinetochores are properly attached.", "journal": "Methods (San Diego, Calif.)", "date": "2010-01-26", "authors": ["Andrew DFranck", "Andrew FPowers", "Daniel RGestaut", "Trisha NDavis", "Charles LAsbury"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.01.020"}

Thin wave-guiding layers of variable thickness are coated on the piezoelectric substrate of the devices. Two different layer materials were used: sputtered SiO(2) and a new polymer in this field, paryleneC (poly-[2-chloro-p-xylylene]). Insertion loss, resonance frequency, frequency changes during protein precipitation and noise of the devices are discussed as a function of the thickness of the wave-guiding layer. It is demonstrated that the application of an optimized wave-guiding layer increases the sensitivity. When using SiO(2) as wave-guiding layer, an optimum layer thickness of 4 microm leads to a detection limit of 1.7 pg/mm(2).

{"title": "Analysis of human tau in cerebrospinal fluid.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by two major hallmarks: neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed from hyperphosphorylated versions of the tau-protein, and neuritic plaques (NP) containing mostly beta-amyloid peptides (A beta) that are formed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by enzymatic cleavage. Despite much progress in recent years, the causes of sporadic (i.e., nonfamiliar) AD are still unclear and its valid diagnosis still relies on autopsy. Clinically used biomarkers present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that is, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated tau and A beta-peptides of different lengths, lack the necessary specificity and sensitivity. Here, we describe a novel strategy to characterize tau versions present in CSF with respect to their molecular mass and isoelectric point. Aliquots of 1 mL CSF (i.e., 700 to 1300 pg tau) from nondemented persons and histopathologically confirmed AD cases were depleted for six dominant proteins, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and then electro-transferred onto PVDF-membranes. Tau was detected with monoclonal antibody (mAb) HT7 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In this way, a complex tau pattern was identified in CSF that was very similar to the tau preparations from autopsy brain samples. The presented strategy enables the analysis of the phosphorylation and processing status of tau in CSF samples from healthy people and patients diagnosed with different neurological disorders. This more-detailed information on circulating tau versions and their clearance rates may facilitate the development of new diagnostic tools.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2010-01-14", "authors": ["KatjaHanisch", "HilkkaSoininen", "IrinaAlafuzoff", "RalfHoffmann"], "doi": "10.1021/pr901002t"}

On the other hand, when membrane bound HIgG was pulsed with pepsin, Fc subfragments were obtained in the flowthrough with F(ab')(2) remaining bound to the membrane. These product profiles suggest that HIgG bound to the membrane through its middle region. Enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and mass spectrometric analysis of eluate samples obtained from the RAMBS experiments provided evidence that the binding of HIgG took place primarily through the segment consisting of the hinge and C(H)2 domain of Fc.

The most frequent complication reported with traditional techniques has been the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane, with perforation rates ranging from 11% to 56%. The purpose of this retrospective, consecutive case series from two private practices was to report on the rate of Schneiderian membrane perforations and arterial lacerations when a piezoelectric surgical unit was used in conjunction with hand instrumentation to perform lateral window sinus elevations.\nClinical data (Schneiderian membrane perforation, Underwood septa, and laceration of the lateral arterial blood supply to the maxillary sinus) were obtained retrospectively from two private practices and pooled for analysis. The information was collated after an exhaustive chart review. Fifty-six consecutively treated lateral window sinus lifts were performed on 50 partially or completely edentate patients.\nZero perforations of the Schneiderian membrane occurred during the piezoelectric preparation of the lateral antrostomies, whereas two perforations were noted during subsequent membrane elevations using hand instrumentation. In both instances, membrane perforations were associated with sinus septa. The overall sinus perforation rate was 3.6%. Arterial branches of the posterior superior alveolar artery were encountered in 35 cases, and there were zero instances of arterial laceration.\nThis retrospective case series from clinical private practices confirmed that a lateral window approach to sinus elevation incorporating piezoelectric technology in conjunction with hand instrumentation was an effective means to achieve sinus elevation while minimizing the potential for intraoperative complications.

Among other aspects, this work has been motivated by the fact that collocated control of smart structures requires a sensor output that is work-conjugated to the input by the actuator. This fact in turn brings into the play the more general question of how to measure mechanically meaningful structural quantities, such as displacements, slopes, or other quantities, which form the work-conjugated quantities of the actuation, by means piezoelectric sensors. At least in the range of small strains, there is confidence that distributed piezoelectric sensors or sensor patches in smart structures do measure weighted integrals over their domain. Therefore, there is a need of distributing or shaping the sensor activity in order to be able to re-interpret the sensor signals in the desired mechanical sense.

Optimal e-nose parameters, such as layer heights (1-6 KHz), sensitivity <20 ppm of analytes, selectivity at 50 ppm of terpenes, repeatability and reproducibility were thoroughly adjusted prior to online monitoring. Linearity in reversible responses over a wide concentration range <20-250 ppm has been achieved. Discrimination between molecules of similar molar masses, even for isomers, e.g. \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene is possible. The array has proven its sensitive and selective properties of sensor responses (20-1,200 Hz) for the difference of fresh and dried herbs.

{"title": "Sub-frequency interval approach in electromechanical impedance technique for concrete structure health monitoring.", "abstract": "The electromechanical (EM) impedance technique using piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers for structural health monitoring (SHM) has attracted considerable attention in various engineering fields. In the conventional EM impedance technique, the EM admittance of a PZT transducer is used as a damage indicator. Statistical analysis methods such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) have been employed to associate the damage level with the changes in the EM admittance signatures, but it is difficult to determine the location of damage using such methods. This paper proposes a new approach by dividing the large frequency (30-400 kHz) range into sub-frequency intervals and calculating their respective RMSD values. The RMSD of the sub-frequency intervals (RMSD-S) will be used to study the severity and location of damage. An experiment is carried out on a real size concrete structure subjected to artificial damage. It is observed that damage close to the PZT changes the high frequency range RMSD-S significantly, while the damage far away from the PZT changes the RMSD-S in the low frequency range significantly. The relationship between the frequency range and the PZT sensing region is also presented. Finally, a damage identification scheme is proposed to estimate the location and severity of damage in concrete structures.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["YaowenYang", "Bahador SabetDivsholi"], "doi": "10.3390/s101211644"}

However, application of strain to the structure can influence the sensitivity of the FBG toward ultrasound and can prevent its effective detection. An FBG can work as a strain-insensitive ultrasound sensor when it is not directly glued to the monitored structure, but is instead applied to a small thin plate to form a mobile sensor. Another possible configuration is to affix an FBG-inscribed optical fiber without the grating section attached to the monitored structure. In the present study, sensitivity to ultrasound propagated through an aluminum plate was compared for a strain-insensitive FBG sensor and an FBG sensor installed in a conventional manner. Strains induced by ultrasound from a piezoelectric transducer and by quasi-acoustic emission of a pencil lead break were also quantitatively evaluated from the response amplitude of the FBG sensor. Experimental results showed that the reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio for ultrasound detection with strain-insensitive FBG sensors, relative to traditionally-installed FBG sensors, was only 6 dB, and the ultrasound-induced strain varied within a range of sub-micron strains.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["HiroshiTsuda", "KenjiKumakura", "ShinjiOgihara"], "doi": "10.3390/s101211248"}

{"title": "Optimization of a Microfluidic Mixing Process for Gene Expression-Based Bio-dosimetry.", "abstract": "In recent decades advances in radiation imaging and radiation therapy have led to a dramatic increase in the number of people exposed to radiation. Consequently, there is a clear need for personalized biodosimetry diagnostics in order to monitor the dose of radiation received and adapt it to each patient depending on their sensitivity to radiation exposure (Hall E.J. and Brenner D. J., 2008). Similarly, after a large-scale radiological event such as a dirty bomb attack, there will be a major need to assess, within a few days the radiation doses received by tens of thousands of individuals. Current high throughput devices can handle only a few hundred individuals per day. Hence there is a great need for a very fast self-contained non-invasive biodosimetric device based on a rapid blood test.This paper presents a case study where regression methods and designed experiments are used to arrive at the optimal settings for various factors that impact the kinetics in a biodosimetric device. We use ridge regression to initially identify a set of potentially important variables in the mixing process which is one of the critical sub systems of the device. This was followed by a series of designed experiments to arrive at the optimal setting of the significant microfluidic cartridge and piezoelectric disk (PZT) (D. Sadler, F. Zenhausern, U.S. Patent 6,986,601; Lee, S. Y., Ko, B., Yang, W., 2005) related factors.

{"title": "Pacemakers charging using body energy.", "abstract": "Life-saving medical implants like pacemakers and defibrillators face a big drawback that their batteries eventually run out and patients require frequent surgery to have these batteries replaced. With the advent of technology, alternatives can be provided for such surgeries. To power these devices, body energy harvesting techniques may be employed. Some of the power sources are patient's heartbeat, blood flow inside the vessels, movement of the body parts, and the body temperature (heat). Different types of sensors are employed, such as for sensing the energy from the heartbeat the piezoelectric and semiconducting coupled nanowires are used that convert the mechanical energy into electricity. Similarly, for sensing the blood flow energy, nanogenerators driven by ultrasonic waves are used that have the ability to directly convert the hydraulic energy in human body to electrical energy. Another consideration is to use body heat employing biothermal battery to generate electricity using multiple arrays of thermoelectric generators built into an implantable chip. These generators exploit the well-known thermocouple effect. For the biothermal device to work, it needs a 2\u00b0C temperature difference across it. But there are many parts of the body where a temperature difference of 5\u00b0C exists - typically in the few millimeters just below the skin, where it is planned to place this device.

{"title": "Fluoride removal from brackish groundwater by direct contact membrane distillation.", "abstract": "The direct contact membrane distillation applied for fluoride removal from brackish groundwater was investigated. The self-prepared polyvinylidene fluoride membrane exhibited high rejection of inorganic salt solutes. The maximum permeate flux 35.6 kg/(m2 x hr) was obtained with the feed solution at 80 degrees C and the cold distillate water at 20 degrees C. The feed concentration had no significant impact on the permeate flux and the rejection in fluoride. The precipitation of CaCO3 would clog the hollow fiber inlets and foul the membrane surface with increasing concentration factor when natural groundwater was used directly as the feed, which resulted in a rapid decline in the module efficiency. This phenomenon was diminished by acidification of the feed. The experimental results showed that the permeate flux and the quality of obtained distillate kept stable before concentration factor reached 5.0 with the acidified groundwater as feed. The membrane module efficiency began to decline gradually when the feed continued to be concentrated, which can be mainly attributed to the formation of CaF2 deposits on the membrane surface.

The authors investigate ultrasonic air pumps that make use of bending vibrators and reflectors and confirm that air can be induced to flow by generating an asymmetric acoustic standing wave along an air gap. In this paper, we proposed a novel ultrasonic air pump in which a traveling wave along an air gap induces acoustic streaming and achieves one-way airflow. Two new reflector configurations, stepped and tapered, were designed and used to generate traveling waves. To predict airflow generation, sound pressure distribution in the air gap was calculated by means of finite element analysis (FEA). As a preliminary step, 2 FEA models were compared: one piezoelectric-structure-acoustic model and one piezoelectric- structure-fluid model, which included the viscosity effect of the fluid. The sound pressure distribution in the air gap, including fluid viscosity, was calculated by the FEA because it is expected to be dominant and thus have a strong effect on the sound pressure field in such a thin fluid layer. Based on the FEA results of the stepped and the tapered reflectors, it was determined that acoustic traveling waves could propagate along the gaps. Experiments were carried out with the designed bending vibrator and the reflectors. The acoustic fields in the air gap were measured via a fiber optic probe, and it was determined that the sound pressure and the phase distribution tendencies corresponded well with the results computed by FEA.

The production efficiency was improved when membrane structure of sperm heads was partially disrupted by detergent or ultrasonic treatment before exposure to the exogenous DNA solution. Exogenous DNAs with various chain lengths were stably integrated into the rodent genomes of various genetic backgrounds by this method.

{"title": "Comparative evaluation of susceptibility to motion artifact in different wearable systems for monitoring respiratory rate.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to comparatively evaluate the performance of different wearable systems based on indirect breathing monitoring in terms of susceptibility to motion artifacts. These performances are compared with direct respiratory measurements using a spirometer, which is accurate, reliable, and less sensitive to movement artifacts, but cannot be integrated into truly wearable form. Experiments were carried out on four indirect methods implemented into wearable systems, inductive plethysmography, impedance plethysmography, piezoresistive pneumography, and piezoelectric pneumography, to ascertain the performance of each of them in terms of noise due to movement artifacts, as well as to study the effects of different movements or gestures during each test. A group of volunteers was asked to wear all of the breath monitoring systems simultaneously along with the face mask of the spirometer while carrying out four physical exercises in a gym under controlled conditions. Data are analyzed in the time and frequency domain to estimate the frequency respiration from each wearable system and compare it with those of the spirometer. Results confirmed that all the wearable systems are somehow affected by movement artifacts, but statistical investigation showed that for most of the physical exercises, three out of four, piezoelectric pneumography provided best performance in terms of robustness and reduced susceptibility to movement artifacts.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["AntonioLanat\u00e0", "Enzo PasqualeScilingo", "ElenaNardini", "GiannicolaLoriga", "RitaParadiso", "DaniloDe-Rossi"], "doi": "10.1109/TITB.2009.2037614"}
{"title": "New MSPQC-PLS method for the early clinic identification of commonly encountered Candida species.", "abstract": "The early clinic identification of commonly encountered Candida species became more important with the increasing human candidiasis. In this paper, a new MSPQC-PLS (multi-channel series piezoelectric quartz crystal biosensor combined with partial least square) method was proposed for early identification of the most frequent Candida species encountered in human pathology. This method was based on these fact that (1) MSPQC method is a real-time monitoring method based on the sensitive frequency response to the change of electric parameters of the culture media caused by the growth of microorganisms; (2) various Candida species produce significantly different types of frequency curves in 1 or 2 days' culture period; (3) this difference can be identified by the partial least square technique. Using the proposed method, three species (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis) from a collection of 53 clinical strains of Candida, isolated from hospitalized patients, were identified with a classification rate of 98.1%. New proposed MSPQC-PLS method is simple, rapid and convenient to perform. It can identify clinical Candida species directly without passing through pure culture process. This will save identification time greatly.

{"title": "Construction of supported lipid membrane modified piezoelectric biosensor for sensitive assay of cholera toxin based on surface-agglutination of ganglioside-bearing liposomes.", "abstract": "A novel piezoelelctric biosensor has been developed for cholera toxin (CT) detection based on the analyte-mediated surface-agglutination of ganglioside (GM1)-functionalized liposomes. To achieve a CT-specific agglutination at the surface, the gold electrode is modified by a GM1-functionalized supported lipid membrane via spontaneous spread of the liposomes on a self-assembled monolayer of a long-chain alkanethiol. In the presence of CT, the GM1-incorporated liposomes in assay medium will rapidly specifically agglutinate at the electrode surface through the binding of CT to GM1 on the electrode surface and the liposome interface. This results in an enormous mass loading on the piezoelelctric crystal as well as a significant increase of density and viscosity at the interface, thereby generating a decrease in frequency of the piezoelelctric crystal. The combination of mass loading with interfacial change in the surface-agglutination reaction allows the developed piezoelelctric biosensor to show substantial signal amplification in response to the analyte CT. The detection limit can be achieved as low as 25 ng mL(-1) CT. This is the first demonstration on CT detection based on specific surface-agglutination of GM1-modified liposomes.

Recent studies have indicated that chronic alcohol consumption leads to the lysine-hyperacetylation of several hepatic proteins, and this list is growing quickly.\nTo identify other hyperacetylated proteins in ethanol-fed livers, we chose a proteomics approach. Cytosolic and membrane proteins (excluding nuclei) were separated on 2D gels, transferred to PVDF and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for acetylated lysine residues. Hyperacetylated proteins were selected for trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric analysis.\nIn all, 40 proteins were identified, 11 of which are known acetylated proteins. Remarkably, the vast majority of hyperacetylated membrane proteins were mitochondrial residents. Hyperacetylated cytosolic proteins ranged in function from metabolism to cytoskeletal support. Notably, 3 key anti-oxidant proteins were identified whose activities are impaired in ethanol-treated cells. We confirmed that the anti-oxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, actin and cortactin are hyperacetylated in ethanol-treated livers.\nAlcohol-induced hyperacetylation of multiple proteins may contribute to the development of liver injury.

The axial polarization changes almost linearly with the strain over a relatively large range, and the ferroelectricity vanishes under a critical compressive strain. With the nanowire becoming thicker, the piezoelectric coefficient increases, and approaches its counterpart for bulk material when the diameter is larger than 2.4 nm. It is also revealed that a pre-tension strain can induce the emergence of a stepwise hysteresis loop while a pre-compression strain can lead to the disappearance of the stepwise shape.

{"title": "Removal of diatrizoate with catalytically active membranes incorporating microbially produced palladium nanoparticles.", "abstract": "There is an increasing concern about the fate of iodinated contrast media (ICM) in the environment. Limited removal efficiencies of currently applied techniques such as advanced oxidation processes require more performant strategies. The aim of this study was to establish an innovative degradation process for diatrizoate, a highly recalcitrant ICM, by using biogenic Pd nanoparticles as free suspension or immobilized in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polysulfone (PSf) membranes. As measured by HPLC-UV, the removal of 20mg L(-1) diatrizoate by a 10mg L(-1) Pd suspension was completed after 4h at a pH of 10. LC-MS analysis provided evidence for the sequential hydrodeiodination of diatrizoate. Pd did not lose its activity after incorporation in the PVDF and PSf matrix and the highest activity (k(cat)=30.0+/-0.4h(-1) L g(-1) Pd) was obtained with a casting solution of 10% PSf and 500mg L(-1) Pd. Subsequently, water containing 20mg L(-1) diatrizoate was treated in a membrane contactor, in which the water was supplied at one side of the membrane while hydrogen was provided at the other side. In a fed batch configuration, a removal efficiency of 77% after a time period of 48h was obtained.

{"title": "Hysteresis compensation of piezoelectric actuators: the modified Rayleigh model.", "abstract": "In this study, we develop a novel modified Rayleigh model for hysteresis compensation in piezoelectric actuators. Piezoelectric actuators suffer from hysteresis, in large drive fields of more than 100 V, which can result in serious displacement errors. The typical phenomenological approach is to use the Rayleigh model; however, this model gives more than 10% difference with experiments at the large electric fields of more than 1kV/mm. Furthermore, there are no studies that apply the Rayleigh model to the compensation of precision actuators, such as stack actuators; it has only been applied in the study of the physical properties of piezoelectric materials. Therefore, we propose a modified Rayleigh model, in which each coefficient is defined differently according to whether the field is increasing or decreasing to account for asymmetry at the high fields. By applying a computer-based control from an inverse form of this modified Rayleigh model, we show that we can compensate for hysteresis to reduce the position error to less than five percent. This model has the merits of reducing complicated fitting procedures and of saving computation time compared to the Preisach model. Specifically, this model cannot only predict the hysteresis curves in all local fields using only one fitting procedure, but also make it possible to control the displacement of various piezo-based actuators without expensive sensors, based on the charge-based model.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JongkyuPark", "WonkyuMoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2009.10.012"}

We hypothesised that Muc1, a highly glycosylated mucin present in cows' milk, may be one such food component. Purified bovine Muc1 was tested for its ability to inhibit binding of common enteric bacterial pathogens to Caco-2 cells grown in vitro. Muc1 caused dose-dependent binding inhibition of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. This inhibition was more pronounced for the Gram negative compared with Gram positive bacteria. It was also demonstrated that Muc1, immobilised on a membrane, bound all these bacterial species in a dose-dependent manner, although there was greater interaction with the Gram negative bacteria. A range of monosaccharides, representative of the Muc1 oligosaccharide composition, were tested for their ability to prevent binding of E. coli and S. Typhimurium to Caco-2 cells. Inhibition was structure dependent with sialic acid, L(-) fucose and D(+) mannose significantly inhibiting binding of both Gram negative species. N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine significantly inhibited binding of E. coli whilst galactose, one of the most abundant Muc1 monosaccharides, showed the strongest inhibition against S. Typhimurium. Treatment with sialidase significantly decreased the inhibitory properties of Muc1, demonstrating the importance of sialic acid in adhesion inhibition.

This approach was investigated in both a simulation and an animal model.\nAfter creating a mold representing the porcine left atrium from the pulmonary veins as far as the mitral valve, a nitinol skeleton was sutured onto interlaced yarns of polyvinylidene fluoride fitting the mold. The resulting device was equipped with a commercially available stentless valve (25 mm) and investigated in a simulator regarding basic functionality. Furthermore, the device was implanted in 8 female pigs through incision of the left atrium during extracorporeal circulation. Before implantation, artificial regurgitation was created by means of excision from the posterior mitral leaflet. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and radiologic examinations followed. For a postmortem examination, the entire heart and the lungs were excised.\nWe could demonstrate the functionality of the heart valve in a complex, collapsible, and self-expanding hollow body. The device adapted to the surrounding structures, leading to an exclusion of the left atrium. Sufficient treatment of mitral regurgitation was monitored hemodynamically and by means of echocardiographic analysis, although overall visualization remained difficult. Therefore in 4 animals computed tomographic scans were performed.

However, in the current culture system designed for tissue interaction, the supplement of serum is required. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility of reproducing epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and ensuing morphogenesis in a serum-free condition. In accordance with the previous studies, by using a standard model of murine fetal submandibular gland (SMG), the tissue interaction and the morphogenesis were largely dependent on serum. Nonetheless, when tissue recombinants were cultivated on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), but not on other biomaterials, the serum-deprived effect could be rescued. On PVDF, SMG tissue recombinant was able to increase epithelial size, de novo synthesize basement membrane, and develop new branches without serum. Although the gene expression levels of selected morphogens were not significantly altered, the precise localization of morphogenetic-decisive extracellular matrix such as type III collagen and the superior adsorbing capacity of essential diffusible factors like fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) might account for PVDF effect.

{"title": "Electric field effects in RUS measurements.", "abstract": "Much of the power of the Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) technique is the ability to make mechanical resonance measurements while the environment of the sample is changed. Temperature and magnetic field are important examples. Due to the common use of piezoelectric transducers near the sample, applied electric fields introduce complications, but many materials have technologically interesting responses to applied static and RF electric fields. Non-contact optical, buffered, or shielded transducers permit the application of charge and externally applied electric fields while making RUS measurements. For conducting samples, in vacuum, charging produces a small negative pressure in the volume of the material--a state rarely explored. At very high charges we influence the electron density near the surface so the propagation of surface waves and their resonances may give us a handle on the relationship of electron density to bond strength and elasticity. Our preliminary results indicate a charge sign dependent effect, but we are studying a number of possible other effects induced by charging. In dielectric materials, external electric fields influence the strain response, particularly in ferroelectrics. Experiments to study this connection at phase transformations are planned. The fact that many geological samples contain single crystal quartz suggests a possible use of the piezoelectric response to drive vibrations using applied RF fields.

In the beat-to-beat heart rate and breath-by-breath respiration rate analyses, the correlation coefficients of the heart and respiration rates from the proposed AMBT method compared with reference methods, electrocardiogram, and respiration effort signal from piezoelectric belt, were 0.98 ( p << 0.01) and 0.96 ( p << 0.01), respectively. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the detection algorithm for snoring event were 93%, 96%, for sleep apnea event were 93%, 88%, and for body movement event were 86%, 100%, respectively. These findings support that ABMT method provides an accurate and reliable means to monitor heartbeat, respiration activities and the sleep events during sleep.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "date": "2009-10-23", "authors": ["Jae HyukShin", "Young JoonChee", "Do-UnJeong", "Kwang SukPark"], "doi": "10.1109/TITB.2009.2034011"}

{"title": "Lateral force calibration: accurate procedures for colloidal probe friction measurements in atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "The colloidal probe technique for atomic force microscopy (AFM) has allowed the investigation of an extensive range of surface force phenomena, including the measurement of frictional (lateral) forces between numerous materials. The quantitative accuracy of such friction measurements is often debated, in part due to a lack of confidence in existing calibration strategies. Here we compare three in situ AFM lateral force calibration techniques using a single colloidal probe, seeking to establish a foundation for quantitative measurement by linking these techniques to accurate force references available at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We introduce a procedure for calibrating the AFM lateral force response to known electrostatic forces applied directly to the conductive colloidal probe. In a second procedure, we apply known force directly to the colloidal probe using a precalibrated piezo-resistive reference cantilever. We found agreement between these direct methods on the order of 2% (within random uncertainty for both measurements). In a third procedure, we performed a displacement-based calibration using the piezo-resistive reference cantilever as a stiffness reference artifact. The method demonstrated agreement on the order of 7% with the direct force methods, with the difference attributed to an expected systematic uncertainty, caused by in-plane deflection in the cantilever during loading. The comparison establishes the existing limits of instrument accuracy and sets down a basis for selection criteria for materials and methods in colloidal probe friction (lateral) force measurements via atomic force microscopy.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["Koo-HyunChung", "Jon RPratt", "Mark GReitsma"], "doi": "10.1021/la902488r"}

Rabbit iliac arteries were implanted with cobalt-chromium stents coated with FP or PC polymer (without drug) and assessed for endothelialization at 14 days by confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Endothelialization was equivalent and near complete for FP and PC polymer-coated stents (>80% by SEM). Acute thrombogenicity was assessed in a Chandler loop model using porcine blood. Thrombus adherence was similar for both polymers as assessed by clot weight, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, and lactate dehydrogenase expression. In vitro cell adhesion assays were performed on FP and PC polymer-coated glass coupon surfaces using HUVECs, HCAECs, and THP-1 monocytes. The number of ECs adhered to FP and control surfaces were equivalent and significantly greater than on PC surfaces (p<0.05). There were no differences in THP-1 monocyte adhesion and cytokine (MCP-1, RANTES, IL-6, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, G-CSF) expression.

The most technical important piezoelectrical ceramics have an acoustic impedance of about 30 MRayl, to improve coupling into water or biological tissue with an acoustic impedance of about 1.5 MRayl a matching layer should have an acoustic impedance of about 6.8 MRayl. With a filling degree of 75 wt.% the new composite material reaches an acoustic impedance of 7 MRayl. The materials are synthesized by a hydrolytic condensation combined with polymerization.

{"title": "Elastic guided wave propagation in a periodic array of multi-layered piezoelectric plates with finite cross-sections.", "abstract": "In this study, we present a model study of guided wave dispersion and resonance behavior of an array of piezoelectric plates with arbitrary cross-sections. The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of the geometry of an element of a 1D-array ultrasound transducer on generating multi-resonance frequency so as to increase the frequency bandwidth of the transducers. A semi-analytical finite-element (SAFE) method is used to model guided wave propagation in multi-layered 1D-array ultrasound transducers. Each element of the array is composed of LiNbO3 piezoelectric material with rectangular or subdiced cross-section. Four-node bilinear finite-elements have been used to discretize the cross-section of the transducer. Dispersion curves showing the dependence of phase and group velocities on the frequency, and mode shapes of propagating modes were obtained for different geometry consurations. A parametric analysis was carried out to determine the effect of the aspect ratio, subdicing, inversion layer and matching layers on the vibrational behavior of 1D-array ultrasound transducers. It was found that the geometry with subdiced cross-section causes more vibration modes compared with the rectangular section. Modal analysis showed that the additional modes correspond to lateral modes of the piezoelectric subdiced section. In addition, some modes have strong normal displacements, which may influence the bandwidth and the pressure field in front of the transducer. In addition, the dispersion curves reveal strong coupling between waveguide modes due to the anisotropy of the piezoelectric crystal. The effect of the matching layers was to cluster extensional and flexural modes within a certain frequency range. Finally, inversion layer is found to have a minor effect on the dispersion curves. This analysis may provide a means to analyze and understand the dynamic response of 1D-array ultrasound transducers.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2009-09-08", "authors": ["Daniel HCortes", "Subhendu KDatta", "Osama MMukdadi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2009.08.006"}

Fibroblasts from human periodontal ligament (hPDLF) and keratinocytes (SCC9) were plated on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT and polytetrafluorethylene membranes at a cell density of 20,000 cells well(-1) and cultured for up to 21 days. Cell morphology, adhesion and proliferation were evaluated in hPDLF and keratinocytes, while total protein content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were assayed only for hPDLF. Using a higher cell density, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to assess the expression of typical genes of hPDLF, such as periostin, PDLs17, S100A4 and fibromodulin, and key phenotypic markers of keratinocytes, including involucrin, keratins 1, 10 and 14. Expression of the apoptotic genes bax, bcl-2 and survivin was evaluated for both cultures. hPDLF adhered and spread more on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT, whereas keratinocytes showed a round shape on both membranes. hPDLF adhesion was greater on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT at 2 and 4h, while keratinocyte adhesion was similar for both membranes. Whereas proliferation was significantly higher for hPDLF on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT at days 1 and 7, no signs of keratinocyte proliferation could be noticed for both membranes. Total protein content was greater on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT at 7, 14 and 21 days, and higher levels of ALP activity were observed on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT at 21 days. Real-time PCR revealed higher expression of phenotypic markers of hPDLF and keratinocytes as well as greater expression of apoptotic genes in cultures grown on P(VDF-TrFE)/BT.

In addition, the transducer elements generated the maximum acoustic average surface intensity of 27 W/cm(2). The array, driven at the low (306-kHz) or high frequency (840-kHz), achieved excellent focusing through an ex vivo human skull and an adequate beam steering range for clinical brain treatments.

Three test foods differing in thickening agent concentration (0.0, 1.5, and 3.0%) were prepared and delivered in different volumes (approximately 3, approximately 5, and approximately 7 ml) to subjects seated on a chair. Viscosity analyses of the 1.5 and 3.0% test foods revealed that they behaved as non-Newtonian fluids and were thixotropic. The 1.5% test food differed from the 3.0% test food in its textural properties (hardness, cohesiveness, and adhesiveness). As determined by a linear model equation method, the thickening agent concentration affected the scores of all six sensory evaluation questions that were answered by the subjects, which suggests that the concentration affected the food properties being evaluated. Consistent with previous reports, thickening agent concentration and test food volume also affected some durational parameters of laryngeal (recorded by a piezoelectric sensor) and suprahyoid muscle (recorded on an electromyogram) motor activity. However, thickening agent concentration and test food volume did not affect the single amplitude parameter of the electromyogram that was measured.

Recent developments in the design and fabrication of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have made them competitive with piezoelectric transducers for use in therapeutic ultrasound applications. In this paper, we present the first designs and prototypes of an eight-element, concentric-ring, CMUT array to treat upper abdominal cancers. This array was simulated and designed to focus 30-50 mm into tissue, and ablate a 2- to 3-cm-diameter tumor within 1 h. Assuming a surface acoustic output pressure of 1 MPa peak-to-peak (8.5 W/cm (2)) at 2.5 MHz, we simulated an array that produced a focal intensity of 680 W/cm (2) when focusing to 35 mm. CMUT cells were then designed to meet these frequency and surface acoustic intensity specifications. These cell designs were fabricated as 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm test transducers and used to verify our models. The test transducers were shown to operate at 2.5 MHz with an output pressure of 1.4 MPa peak-to-peak (16.3 W/cm (2)). With this CMUT cell design, we fabricated a full eight-element array. Due to yield issues, we only developed electronics to focus the four center elements of the array. The beam profile of the measured array deviated from the simulated one because of the crosstalk effects; the beamwidth matched within 10% and sidelobes increased by two times, which caused the measured gain to be 16.6 compared to 27.4.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2009-07-25", "authors": ["Serena HWong", "MarioKupnik", "Ronald DWatkins", "KimButts-Pauly", "Butrus T PierreKhuri-Yakub"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2009.2026909"}

Cell growth platforms with controlled content, geometry and spatial distribution of bioactive and stem cell attractive areas were fabricated either by micro-contact printing or piezoelectric spotting of polycationic biomolecules or extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) on cell-repellent surfaces. HUCB-NSCs were shown to adhere, differentiate and respond to neurotoxic MeHgCl on functional domains in a manner dependent on protein type and concentration, cell density and serum conditions. While receptor-mediated interactions with ECM proteins under absence of serum promote neuronal differentiation, non-specific adhesion to polycationic molecules maintain cells attached to the surface in non-differentiated stage. Functional domains were further engineered to create \"smart\" microenvironment by immobilizing to the surface signaling molecules together with ECM proteins. Stimulation of selected intracellular pathways by molecules of Wnt, Shh, CNTF or Notch type resulted in differentiation of HUCB-NSC to either neuronal or astroglial lineage. Sensor techniques applied to HUCB-NSC included measurements of electrical activity using multielectrode array chips. Spontaneous electrical field potentials of HUCB-NSCs were dependent upon developmental stage of tested cells.

The innovative system consists of a multimodal broadband piezoelectric transducer based on polyvinylidene fluoride polymer integrated into a textile belt wrapped around the chest. An advanced electronic control unit, floating power supply, and wireless communication support make it suitable for portable monitoring during critical cardiopulmonary failures. The multimodal transducer is innovative in that only one sensitive element is employed to work as either an ultrasound (US) transceiver or piezoelectric sensor. The US transceiver is enabled to work at high frequency, i.e., it is excited by suitable pulses to emit an ultrasonic wave, which penetrates the body and receives the echo signals bouncing off the biological interfaces having different acoustic impedances. The piezoelectric sensor works at low frequency and acquires both signals generated by heart apex movements and the mechanical movement of the chest induced by respiration. This multimodality is allowed by a broadband of sensitivity jointly at a low value of the figure of merit (Q). Moreover, the transducer thickness is thin enough to assure a good adaptability to the biological site, and it is equipped with an advanced control unit enabling to switch from a high to a low working frequency.

After in vitro maturation (24 h), cumulus complex oocytes were divided into four groups: G1 - the ICSI was performed without the use of a PD and the oocyte was activated with I + R; G2 - the ICSI was performed with the use of the PD and activation with I + R; G3 - the ICSI was performed with the use of the PD, but without activation and G4 - parthenogenetic control, treated with I + R, but without sperm injection. The presumptive zygotes were cultured for 7 days and evaluated on day 3 for cleavage rate and on day 7 for blastocyst formation. Embryo production by standard in vitro fertilization in the laboratory was 78% for cleavage (117/150) and 35% for blastocyst formation (41/150). The cleavage rates obtained in G1, G2 and G4 were similar (66.7%, 71.6% and 66.3%, respectively), demonstrating the beneficial effect of oocyte activation. However, in G3, despite the presence of the sperm and the electric stimulation of a PD, the cleavage rates were significantly lower (17.5%) compared with the groups that used chemical activation, even in the absence of sperm (G4). Despite the beneficial effects of activation, this stimulus alone, or in the absence of the PD, was not sufficient for adequate morulae formation (13.4%, 37.9%, 0.0% and 13.5% for G1, G2, G3 and G4, respectively). Only in G2, when the PD was used followed by artificial activation, blastocysts were obtained (14.7%). These results indicate that cattle oocytes must be activated after ICSI to produce viable embryos.", "journal": "Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene", "date": "2009-01-16", "authors": ["L GDevito", "C BFernandes", "I D PBlanco", "P MTsuribe", "F CLandim-Alvarenga"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01323.x"}

We show that the calculated ideal tensile strength is 6.85\u00a0GPa and that the superlattice under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress becomes soft along the nonpolar axes. We also find that the appropriately applied uniaxial tensile stress can significantly enhance the piezoelectricity for the superlattice, with piezoelectric coefficient d(33) increasing from the ground state value by a factor of about 8, reaching 678.42\u00a0pC/N. The underlying mechanism for the enhancement of piezoelectricity is discussed.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["YifengDuan", "ChunmeiWang", "GangTang", "ChangqingChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s11671-009-9497-1\n10.1088/0022-3727/41/21/215408\n10.1103/PhysRevB.52.6301\n10.1140/epjb/e2003-00086-6\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.1767\n10.1038/358136a0\n10.1038/35002022\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.037601\n10.1088/0256-307X/25/3/083\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.257601\n10.1063/1.2912721\n10.1088/0256-307X/26/1/017203\n10.1088/0953-8984/20/17/175210\n10.1063/1.3077231\n10.1063/1.3053148\n10.1063/1.1559651\n10.1007/s10853-007-2212-7\n10.1016/S0927-0256(02)00325-7\n10.1103/PhysRevB.41.1227\n10.1103/PhysRevB.55.10355\n10.1103/RevModPhys.73.515\n10.1103/PhysRevB.71.035117\n10.1103/PhysRevB.47.1651\n10.1103/PhysRevB.70.104112\n10.1103/PhysRevB.77.045213\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.180101"}
