However, lack of easy and effective method for dynamically manipulating the focused acoustic field is a common and tricky problem faced by current photoacoustic technology.

Different from existed prevailing device architecture, a sandwich like photoacoustic conversion layer is innovatively designed into a suspending elastic membrane with clamped boundary and it can be deformed using integrated pneumatic actuator. Owing to the membrane deflection property, concave spherical contours with variable radius of curvature can be obtained.

The proposed filtering topologies include hybrid configurations consisting of piezoelectric MEMS resonators and surface-mounted lumped elements. The MEMS resonators set the center frequency and provide electromechanical coupling to construct the filters, while the lumped-element-based matching networks help widen the bandwidth (BW) and enhance the out-of-band rejection. Aluminum nitride (AlN) S0 Lamb wave resonators are then applied to the proposed filtering topologies. AlN S0 first- and second-order wideband filters are studied and have shown prominent performance. Finally, the AlN S0 first-order wideband filter is experimentally implemented and characterized. The demonstrated first-order filter shows a large fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 5.6% (achieved with a resonator coupling of 0.94%) and a low insertion loss (IL) of 1.84\u2009dB. The extracted bandwidth widening factor (BWF) is 6, which is approximately 12 times higher than those of the current ladder or lattice filtering topologies.

{"title": "Capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers for intravascular ultrasound imaging.", "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a burgeoning imaging technology that provides vital information for the diagnosis of coronary arterial diseases. A significant constituent that enables the IVUS system to attain high-resolution images is the ultrasound transducer, which acts as both a transmitter that sends acoustic waves and a detector that receives the returning signals. Being the most mature form of ultrasound transducer available in the market, piezoelectric transducers have dominated the field of biomedical imaging. However, there are some drawbacks associated with using the traditional piezoelectric ultrasound transducers such as difficulties in the fabrication of high-density arrays, which would aid in the acceleration of the imaging speed and alleviate motion artifact. The advent of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has brought about the development of micromachined ultrasound transducers that would help to address this issue. Apart from the advantage of being able to be fabricated into arrays with lesser complications, the image quality of IVUS can be further enhanced with the easy integration of micromachined ultrasound transducers with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). This would aid in the mitigation of parasitic capacitance, thereby improving the signal-to-noise. Currently, there are two commonly investigated micromachined ultrasound transducers, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (PMUTs) and capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs). Currently, PMUTs face a significant challenge where the fabricated PMUTs do not function as per their design. Thus, CMUTs with different array configurations have been developed for IVUS. In this paper, the different ultrasound transducers, including conventional-piezoelectric transducers, PMUTs and CMUTs, are reviewed, and a summary of the recent progress of CMUTs for IVUS is presented.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2021-09-28", "authors": ["JiaqiWang", "ZhouZheng", "JasmineChan", "John T WYeow"], "doi": "10.1038/s41378-020-0181-z\n10.1117/12.2510000.short"}

The waveform generated by the ring contains patterns that may be indicative of low blood pressure and/or high vascular resistance, both of which are markers of a low cardiac index. In particular, the waveform contains reflection waves whose timing and amplitude are correlated with pulse travel time and vascular resistance, respectively. Hence, the pattern of the waveform is expected to vary in response to changes in blood pressure and vascular resistance. By analyzing the morphology of the waveform, our aim was to create a tool to identify patients with low cardiac index. This was done using a convolutional neural network which was trained on data from animal models. The model was then tested on waveforms that were collected from patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization.

{"title": "Auditory Feedback Effectiveness for Enabling Safe Sclera Force in Robot-Assisted Vitreoretinal Surgery: a Multi-User Study.", "abstract": "Robot-assisted retinal surgery has become increasingly prevalent in recent years in part due to the potential for robots to help surgeons improve the safety of an immensely delicate and difficult set of tasks. The integration of robots into retinal surgery has resulted in diminished surgeon perception of tool-to-tissue interaction forces due to robot's stiffness. The tactile perception of these interaction forces (sclera force) has long been a crucial source of feedback for surgeons who rely on them to guide surgical maneuvers and to prevent damaging forces from being applied to the eye. This problem is exacerbated when there are unfavorable sclera forces originating from patient movements (dynamic eyeball manipulation) during surgery which may cause the sclera forces to increase even drastically. In this study we aim at evaluating the efficacy of providing warning auditory feedback based on the level of sclera force measured by force sensing instruments. The intent is to enhance safety during dynamic eye manipulations in robot-assisted retinal surgery. The disturbances caused by lateral movement of patient's head are simulated using a piezo-actuated linear stage. The Johns Hopkins Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER), is then used in a multi-user experiment. Twelve participants are asked to perform a mock retinal surgery by following painted vessels inside an eye phantom using a force sensing instrument while auditory feedback is provided. The results indicate that the users are able to handle the eye motion disturbances while maintaining the sclera forces within safe boundaries when audio feedback is provided.", "journal": "Proceedings of the ...

{"title": "Recent Advances in Strain-Induced Piezoelectric and Piezoresistive Effect-Engineered 2D Semiconductors for Adaptive Electronics and Optoelectronics.", "abstract": "The development of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has attracted widespread attentions in the scientific community and industry due to their ultra-thin thickness, unique structure, excellent optoelectronic properties and novel physics. The excellent flexibility and outstanding mechanical strength of 2D semiconductors provide opportunities for fabricated strain-sensitive devices and utilized strain tuning their electronic and optic-electric performance. The strain-engineered one-dimensional materials have been well investigated, while there is a long way to go for 2D semiconductors. In this review, starting with the fundamental theories of piezoelectric and piezoresistive effect resulted by strain, following we reviewed the recent simulation works of strain engineering in novel 2D semiconductors, such as Janus 2D and 2D-Xene structures. Moreover, recent advances in experimental observation of strain tuning PL spectra and transport behavior of 2D semiconductors are summarized. Furthermore, the applications of strain-engineered 2D semiconductors in sensors, photodetectors and nanogenerators are also highlighted.

The most important aspect in fabrication is to obtain a design that provides a low detection limit. The utilization of nanomaterials as a label, catalyst and biosensing transducer is, perhaps, the most popular approach in ultrasensitive devices. This chapter reviews recent advances in immunosensor fabrication and summarizes the most recent studies.

{"title": "Electromechanical impedance measurements for bone health monitoring through teeth used as probes of a Piezo-device.", "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic biological tissue that acts as the primary rigid support of the body. Several systemic factors are responsible for pathologies that negatively affect its structural attributes. Although the bone is in continuous renewal by osteogenesis, metabolic diseases are the most common affectations that alter its natural equilibrium. Different techniques based on ionizing radiation are used for the bone diagnosis restrictively. However, if these are not used adequately, the application could present risks for human health. In this paper, it is proposed and explored a new technique to apply an early-stage diagnosis of bone variations. The technique evaluates bone structural conditions from the teeth (used as probes) by applying a structural health monitoring (SHM) methodology. An experimental procedure is described to identify the stiffness variations produced by mechanical drillings done in prepared bone samples. The identification is carried out applying the electromechanical impedance technique (EMI) through a piezo-actuated device in the frequency spectrum 5-20kHz. Three bone samples with incorporated teeth (three teeth, two teeth, and one tooth) were prepared to emulate a mandibular portion of alveolar bone-PDL (periodontal ligament)-tooth system. Piezo-device was attached to the crown of the tooth with an orthodontic bracket allowing the teeth to act as probes. The electrical resistance measurements were computed with an electrical decoupling approach that improved the detection of the drillings; it was due to the increment of the sensitivity of the signals. The results showed that the bone mass reduction is correlated with statistical indices obtained in specific frequency intervals of the electrical resistance. This work suggests the possibility of a future application addressed to a bone diagnosis in a non-invasive way.", "journal": "Biomedical physics & engineering express", "date": "2021-05-27", "authors": ["Carlos ICardona", "Hector ATinoco", "Maribel L FMar\u00edn-Berrio", "JulianaGarc\u00eda-Grisales", "Juan PGomez", "Samuel IRoldan-Restrepo", "JulianaOrtiz-Jimenez"], "doi": "10.1088/2057-1976/abc099"}
{"title": "A Fully Actuated Robotic Assistant for MRI-Guided Precision Conformal Ablation of Brain Tumors.", "abstract": "This paper reports the development of a fully actuated robotic assistant for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided precision conformal ablation of brain tumors using an interstitial high intensity needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) ablator probe. The robot is designed with an eight degree-of-freedom (DOF) remote center of motion (RCM) manipulator driven by piezoelectric actuators, five for aligning the ultrasound thermal ablator to the target lesions and three for inserting and orienting the ablator and its cannula to generate a desired ablation profile. The 8-DOF fully actuated robot can be operated in the scanner bore during imaging; thus, alleviating the need of moving the patient in or out of the scanner during the procedure, and therefore potentially reducing the procedure time and streamlining the workflow. The free space positioning accuracy of the system is evaluated with the OptiTrack motion capture system, demonstrating the root mean square (RMS) error of the tip position to be 1.11\u00b10.43mm. The system targeting accuracy in MRI is assessed with phantom studies, indicating the RMS errors of the tip position to be 1.45\u00b10.66mm and orientation to be 1.53\u00b10.69\u00b0. The feasibility of the system to perform thermal ablation is validated through a preliminary ex-vivo tissue study with position error less than 4.3mm and orientation error less than 4.3\u00b0.", "journal": "IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division", "date": "2021-05-18", "authors": ["GangLi", "Niravkumar APatel", "Everette CBurdette", "Julie GPilitsis", "HaoSu", "Gregory SFischer"], "doi": "10.1109/tmech.2020.3012903"}

The present experiment was performed to evaluate damage to the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), histologically, after osteotomy of the buccal cortex of the mandible using piezoelectric devices versus surgical handpieces. Forty rabbits underwent bilateral osteotomy of the mandibular buccal cortex. For the osteotomy of one side, piezoelectric devices were used, and for the other, conventional rotary handpieces. After cleavage of the osteotomised cortical bone segments, the exposed part of the IAN was excised and examined histologically for nerve injury. IAN damage was scored histologically from Grade 0 (no nerve damage) to Grade 4 (complete nerve transection). It was found that 25% and 17.5% of nerves had Grade 0; 17.5% and 10% had Grade 1; 25% and 20% had Grade 2; 17.5% and 27.5% had Grade 3; and 15% and 25% had Grade 4 injury in piezosurgery and rotary groups, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed no significant difference between groups in damage to the IAN.

A total of 12 standardized alveolar splits were prepared on the maxillae of 3 elderly female donors using an oscillating piezoelectric saw. Mimicking the surgical distraction process of the lamella, each split was tested to failure using a dental osteotome attached to the crosshead of an electromechanical testing system.

{"title": "Strategies for Alleviating Electrode Expansion of Graphite Electrodes in Sodium-Ion Batteries Followed by In Situ Electrochemical Dilatometry.", "abstract": "The electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite is a highly reversible process, but leads to large, undesired electrode expansion/shrinkage (\"breathing\"). Herein, two strategies to mitigate the electrode expansion are studied. Starting with the standard configuration (-) sodium | diglyme (2G) electrolyte | graphite (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder) (+), the PVDF binder is first replaced with a binder made of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Second, ethylenediamine (EN) is added to the electrolyte solution as a co-solvent. The electrode breathing is followed in\u2009situ (operando) through electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). It is found that replacing PVDF with CMC is only effective in reducing the electrode expansion during initial sodiation. During cycling, the electrode breathing for both binders is comparable. Much more effective is the addition of EN. The addition of 10\u2009v/v EN to the diglyme electrolyte strongly reduces the electrode expansion during the initial sodiation (+100% with EN versus +175% without EN) as well as the breathing during cycling. A more detailed analysis of the ECD signals reveals that solvent co-intercalation temporarily leads to pillaring of the graphite lattice and that the addition of EN to 2G leads to a change in the sodium storage mechanism.", "journal": "Energy technology (Weinheim, Germany)", "date": "2021-04-02", "authors": ["InesEscher", "YuliiaKravets", "Guillermo AFerrero", "MustafaGoktas", "PhilippAdelhelm"], "doi": "10.1002/ente.202000880"}

The conductive black ink for paintable electrodes was synthesized by mixing poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and typical black ink and optimizing the mixing ratio. At an optimal mixing ratio, the brush-paintable black electrodes showed a sheet resistance of 151 \u03a9/sq and high coatability for flexible piezoelectric devices. Noticeably, higher black ink ratios increased adhesion forces, while diminished the shear flow of the conductive black ink. In addition, the optimized conductive black electrode exhibited an outstanding level of mechanical flexibility due to good adhesion between the black electrode and the PVDF substrate. During the repeated inner/outer bending fatigue tests with high strain, no resistance change confirmed the outstanding flexibility of the brush-paintable conductive electrode. As a promising application of the brush-paintable optimized black electrode, we suggested highly flexible piezoelectric devices that can be used. A PVDF-based piezoelectric speaker and a generator with the brush-paintable black electrode showed acoustic and output signal values approximate to those of metallic electrodes fabricated by vacuum-based high-cost thermal evaporators.

{"title": "A Physical Perspective to the Inductive Function of Myelin-A Missing Piece of Neuroscience.", "abstract": "Starting from the inductance in neurons, two physical origins are discussed, which are the coil inductance of myelin and the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane. The direct evidence of the coil inductance of myelin is the opposite spiraling phenomenon between adjacent myelin sheaths confirmed by previous studies. As for the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane, which has been well-known in physics, the direct evidence is the mechanical wave accompany with action potential. Therefore, a more complete physical nature of neural signals is provided. In conventional neuroscience, the neural signal is a pure electrical signal. In our new theory, the neural signal is an energy pulse containing electrical, magnetic, and mechanical components. Such a physical understanding of the neural signal and neural systems significantly improve the knowledge of the neurons. On the one hand, we achieve a corrected neural circuit of an inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) form, whose frequency response and electrical characteristics have been validated by previous studies and the modeling fitting of artifacts in our experiments. On the other hand, a number of phenomena observed in neural experiments are explained. In particular, they are the mechanism of magnetic nerve stimulations and ultrasound nerve stimulations, the MRI image contrast issue and Anode Break Excitation. At last, the biological function of myelin is summarized.

{"title": "Sinus lift through the use of a surgical guide: a case report.", "abstract": "Sinus lift is a common procedure to achieve bone height in the maxillary posterior region. This surgery can be performed through either a lateral or crestal approach. Preoperative planning usually entails CBCT and intraoperative evaluation at the time of surgery. This article presents a case in which a surgical guide was made by digitally planning for the performance of a sinus lift procedure through a lateral approach.\nA 59-year-old partially edentulous female patient underwent sinus lift surgery using a stereolithographic guide designed in NemoStudio software and printed using clear, biocompatible MED610. On the day of surgery, the bone guide was fixed with pins, and the lateral window was made by piezoelectric surgery. There were no intraoperative or postoperative incidents.\nThere are very few descriptions in the literature of the use of surgical guides for sinus lift. In this case, the advantages of its use were the precision in the performance of the window, the speed and comfort of access, and the retractor effect of the guide on the flap. The main drawback was the need to raise a wide flap to achieve good settlement of the guide.\nThe present case, which presents an innovative technique for the opening of the lateral window in a sinus lift procedure, is interesting for the advancement of computer-guided surgery.", "journal": "International journal of computerized dentistry", "date": "2021-01-26", "authors": ["BeatrizPardal-Pel\u00e1ez", "Juan Ram\u00f3nC\u00f3rdoba-Llorente", "CarlosBelarra-Arenas"], "doi": null}

In addition, these materials can be used for conversion of human-body energy into electricity for powering wearable electronics. In this paper, we review the recent advances in flexible ferroelectric materials for wearable human energy harvesting and sensing. To meet the performance requirements for medical applications, the most suitable materials and manufacturing techniques are reviewed. The approaches used to enhance performance and achieve long-term sustainability and multi-functionality by integrating other active sensing mechanisms (e.g. triboelectric and piezoresistive effects) are discussed.

Few polymers have antiviral effects that reduce infectivity or the presence of a virus in the human environment. Some of the effects are due to certain physical properties, e.g., high hydrophobicity. Other materials owe their antiviral activity to a modified physicochemical structure favoring the action on specific virus receptors or on their biochemistry.

{"title": "Acoustic Poration and Dynamic Healing of Mammalian Cell Membranes during Inkjet Printing.", "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of piezoelectric actuating voltage on cell behavior after drop on demand inkjet printing using mouse 3T3 cells as a model cell line. Cell viability after printing was assessed using a live/dead assay, Alamar Blue as an assay for cell proliferation, and propidium iodide (PI) and Texas Red labeled dextran molecular probes to assess cell membrane integrity. No significant difference was found for the cell death rate compared between an unprinted control population and after printing at 80, 90, and 100 V, respectively. However, cell proliferation was lower than that of the control population at all time points postprinting. Cell membrane integrity was quantified using PI and dextran probes of mean molecular weight of 3, 10, 40, and 70 kDa. Total membrane damage (assessed by PI) increased with increasing piezoelectric actuator driving voltage, and this was always greater than the unprinted control cells. The uptake of the labeled dextran only occurs after inkjet printing and was never observed with the control cells. The largest dextran molecular probe of 70 kDa was only taken up by cells after printing using the lower printing voltages of 80 and 90 V and was absent after printing at 100 V. At the two lower printing voltages, the membrane damage is recovered, and no dextran molecule penetrated the cells 2 h after printing. However, printing at 100 V leads to an increased uptake of 3 and 10 kDa dextran molecules, the retention of membrane porosity, and continued uptake of these 3 and 10 kDa dextran for greater than 2 h postprinting. We hypothesize that the change in membrane porosity with increasing actuation voltage can be explained by distinct nucleation and growth stages for pore formation in response to printing stress.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2021-01-20", "authors": ["SrimantaBarui", "Rachel ESaunders", "SharmisthaNaskar", "BikramjitBasu", "BrianDerby"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01635"}

The Concept Mapping methodology and the Conceptual Design approach were utilized to elaborate the 3D bioprinting process flow. It was developed a bioink with corneal epithelial cells. To simulate an in situ bioprinting process, eyes of pigs were selected as the substrate to print the cells. Print scripts used the digitally treated images. In order to print on predefined locations, alignment devices and sample holders were built. The proposed process flow has shown to be a potential tool for the biofabrication of ophthalmological solutions.", "journal": "Biomedical physics & engineering express", "date": "2021-01-14", "authors": ["Juliana LopesHoehne", "ReginaCarlstron", "Jana\u00ednaDernorwsek", "Priscila CardosoCristovam", "Helder LuizBachiega", "Silvia ItzcoviciAbensur", "PauloSchor"], "doi": "10.1088/2057-1976/ab7bf9"}

Previously, our group reported use of an endoscopic transplantation device fabricated with a 3-dimensional printer. Cell sheets are transplanted to the esophageal wound site with the following procedure: first, a cell sheet harvested from temperature-responsive culture dishes is placed on the device's deflated balloon surface and transported to the wound site with endoscopic forceps; second, by applying pressure from inflating the balloon locally at the wound site, the cell sheet is successfully transferred and adhered to the wound tissue; third, the balloon is deflated, and the device is removed. By repeating the procedure, several cell sheets can be safely transplanted to a wider ESD area. Nonetheless, possible damage to cell sheets using this procedure has not yet been assessed.\nEffects of endoscopic transplantation balloon inflation on cell viability and damage of normal human epidermal keratinocyte sheets resident on the device's balloon surface were evaluated by histology after sheet placement onto lumenal surfaces in the ex\u00a0vivo porcine submucosal dissection esophagus model. Endoscopic transplantation of these same cell sheets with conventional methods using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) cell sheet support membrane, balloon device transfer, and also using a novel modified balloon transfer procedure was also examined. Cell sheet transfer results obtained with these three procedures were compared.\nNormal human epidermal keratinocyte sheets were fabricated on temperature-responsive culture inserts. By temperature reduction to 20\u00a0\u00b0C, all cells were harvested as a single contiguous cell sheet. Freshly excised porcine esophagi purchased in a slaughter house were turned inside-out, and the exposed lumenal mucosa and submucosal layers were removed by Cooper scissors. This luminal surface was then utilized as a transplantation bed in ex\u00a0vivo cell sheet experiments. Cell sheets were adhered to the endoscopic transfer device balloon, expanded by balloon inflation and resulting cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion test after cell sheet trypsinization and dispersion. Cell sheets were transferred onto the esophagus lumen ex\u00a0vivo using forceps and the balloon device, and also using a modified balloon transfer method. The obtained results were compared with those without balloon expansion, and evaluated for sheet thickness and lumenal histology. Finally, TUNEL staining was performed to examine cell apoptosis.\nCell sheets thinned after cell sheet balloon expansion, but no apoptosis was observed after these procedures.\nExpanding keratinocyte cell sheets on a balloon endoscopic transfer device did not damage the cell sheets.

Increasing evidences have shown that lncRNA MALAT1 is abundant in fibroblasts and may be engaged in wound healing process. Therefore, we explored the mechanism of MALAT1 affecting wound healing.\nThe expression levels of MALAT1, miR-141-3p as well as ZNF217 in human fibroblast cells (HFF-1) were quantified by qRT-PCR. HFF-1 proliferation was measured by MTT, while migration was detected by wound healing assay. SMAD2 activation and matrix proteins expression were detected by western blotting. The interaction between miR-141-3p and MALAT1 or ZNF217 was further confirmed using the luciferase reporter gene assay. In\u00a0vivo wound healing was assessed by full-thickness wound healing model on C57BL/6 mice.\nKnockdown of MALAT1 as well as overexpression miR-141-3p remarkably inhibited the proliferation, migration and matrix protein expression in HFF-1\u00a0cells. MALAT1 directly targeted and inhibited the expression of miR-141-3p. MiR-141-3p suppressed the activation of TGF-\u03b22/SMAD2 signaling pathway by targeting ZNF217.

The AOTFs with large interaction length apply the bulk acoustic wave (BAW) reflection from the input optical facet. Optimization is based on spectral approach to simulation of the BAW field in anisotropic media and Raman-Nath equations numerically solved for the inhomogeneous acoustic field. It was found that variation of the transducer dimensions can minimize RF power consumption of the AOTF. Comparison of the optimized transducer dimensions with those commonly used in quasicollinear paratellurite AOTFs showed that it is possible to improve the AOTF energy efficiency in about 2 times. It was shown that acoustic field simulation results obtained for one AOTF geometry can be applied to the other geometries but for equivalent frequency providing the same ultrasound beam ray spectrum width. It was also shown that when choosing the quasicollinear AOTF with reflection geometry, one should not rely only on the AO figure of merit value, since the energy efficiency of such AOTF type will be determined by the product of the AO figure of merit and the AOTF efficiency, which takes into account the change in the acoustic beam width in the reflection process.

The direct modulation system can reach 3\u00d7 higher signal-to-noise ratio level and 3\u00d7 higher communication range (from 6.2 cm boosted to 18.6 cm) when compared to more traditional continuous wave drive at the same energy consumption levels. When compared for the same transmission performance, the direct modulation consumes 80% less energy compared to the continues wave. The increased performance is achieved with a switching circuit that allows to generate a short high-AC voltage on the ultrasonic array, by using an LC tank and a bipolar junction transistor, starting with a low-DC voltage, making it CMOS-compatible. Since the modulation signal can directly be formed by the transmitted bits (on/off keying encoding) this also serve as the modulation for the data itself, hence direct modulation.

The ASIC, implemented in a 0.18 \u00b5m high-voltage Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (HV BCD) process, adopted a programmable switch matrix that allowed selected transducer elements in each row to be connected to a transmit and receive channel of an imaging system. This made the probe operate like an electronically translatable linear array, allowing large-aperture matrix arrays to be interfaced with a manageable number of system channels. This paper presents a second-generation ASIC that employed an improved switch design to minimize clock feedthrough and charge-injection effects of high-voltage metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (HV MOSFETs), which in the first-generation ASIC caused parasitic transmissions and associated imaging artifacts. The proposed switch controller, implemented with cascaded non-overlapping clock generators, generated control signals with improved timing to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities.

{"title": "Improvement in step resolution and response time of ultrasonic motor by using a piezoelectric resonant shunting circuit as damping control.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic motors can be driven by burst voltage to obtain micro-stepping motion, and the corresponding step size depends on the load and cycle number of the applied ac driving voltage in one burst. The rotor of the motor achieves a step motion through a process of startup-acceleration-deceleration-stop. To obtain a large torque (or thrust force) and quick startup, a large vibration amplitude of a stator and a high growth rate are desired; thus, a large mechanical quality factor and a high electromechanical coupling factor are required. However, the stator vibration decays for a long time before it stops because of low mechanical energy loss; meanwhile, the rotor moves a big step. Hence, there is contradiction between thrust force and resolution/response time. This paper presents a new drive method to improve the step resolution and response time while keeping the torque by damping control. By simply adding a switch and a shunting damp circuit and connecting the shunting circuit to ultrasonic motors at the end of a drive burst signal, the stator vibration attenuates more rapidly and the step size is reduced. First, the damping effect of the piezoelectric system with a passive resonant shunting circuit (a resistor and an inductor connected in series) on the free stator of a bar-type rotary traveling wave ultrasonic motor has been tested. Next, a drive circuit comprising electronic switches and the shunting circuit is designed and utilized for measuring the performance of the motor.

Based on the scattering cancellation technique, the piezoelectric cloaking mechanism and dynamic stress concentration factor (DSCF) is obtained by the plane wave expansion method. A nonlinear ray trajectory equation for SH waves is derived based on the nonlinear transformation. Furthermore, piezoelectric effects on both cloaking mechanism and dynamic stress concentration are analyzed. The numerical results show that the scattering cancellation can be attributed to the cloak density, and the piezoelectric property can enhance the object's invisibility. The piezoelectric cloaking design can be applied to reduce the DSCF in some frequency regions, which means that it can change the stress distribution. It means that piezoelectric scattering cancellation can enhance both the cloaking results and structural strength of the mechanical metamaterials.

This generalised propagation is characterized through an anisotropic phase velocity, which should ensure the decay of wave-field with depth into the medium. A linear homogeneous system of six equations with complex coefficients governs the existence and propagation of surface waves in the considered medium. The real phase velocity of surface waves lies implicit in a complex determinantal equation, which ensures a non-trivial solution to the system of equations. Through a specific transformation, the system of complex equations is modified to yield a real secular equation, with phase velocity being the only unknown. This equation can always be solved numerically for phase velocity of surface wave along any direction on the plane boundary of anisotropic piezo-poroelastic medium. The phase velocity has been used further to calculate the components of energy flux at the boundary. Horizontal components of energy flux define the group velocity and ray direction for the surface wave.

{"title": "Acoustic Emission and K-S Metric Entropy as Methods for Determining Mechanical Properties of Composite Materials.", "abstract": "Due to the unique properties of polymer composites, these materials are used in many industries, including shipbuilding (hulls of boats, yachts, motorboats, cutters, ship and cooling doors, pontoons and floats, torpedo tubes and missiles, protective shields, antenna masts, radar shields, and antennas, etc.). Modern measurement methods and tools allow to determine the properties of the composite material, already during its design. The article presents the use of the method of acoustic emission and Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) metric entropy to determine the mechanical properties of composites. The tested materials were polyester-glass laminate without additives and with a 10% content of polyester-glass waste. The changes taking place in the composite material during loading were visualized using a piezoelectric sensor used in the acoustic emission method. Thanks to the analysis of the RMS parameter (root mean square of the acoustic emission signal), it is possible to determine the range of stresses at which significant changes occur in the material in terms of its use as a construction material. In the K-S entropy method, an important measuring tool is the extensometer, namely the displacement sensor built into it. The results obtained during the static tensile test with the use of an extensometer allow them to be used to calculate the K-S metric entropy. Many materials, including composite materials, do not have a yield point. In principle, there are no methods for determining the transition of a material from elastic to plastic phase. The authors showed that, with the use of a modern testing machine and very high-quality instrumentation to record measurement data using the Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) metric entropy method and the acoustic emission (AE) method, it is possible to determine the material transition from elastic to plastic phase.

In order to effectively transmit waves through the junction of the waveguide bar and the monitoring target, it is necessary to research a reliable coupling method to connect the waveguide transducers with the host structure. In the present research, the feasibility of brazing coupling for wave propagation through the junction was investigated through experiments. Piezoelectric waveguide transducers were welded using various kinds of brazing filler metals. The experimental results indicate that the coupling effects of the brazing welding depend on the filler metals. At the same time, some filler metals for the effective coupling of the transducer and the target monitoring component were identified. The brazing coupling method was verified that it can non-dispersively and effectively propagate waves into the host structure with much better reliability than the conventional dry coupling approach. Moreover, the high-temperature experimental results show that the brazing-coupled waveguide bar system can work reliably and stably in high temperatures at 300 \u00b0C for a long time.

The considered idealized necked lug sample has a simplified geometry and does not includes the typical bearing. Numerical simulations with coupled-field finite element (FE) models are used to study the frequency response behavior of necked lugs. These numerical analyses include both pristine and cracked lug models. Through-cracks are located at 90\u2218 and 145\u2218 to the lug axis, which are critical spots for damage initiation. The results of FE simulations with a crack location at 90\u2218 are validated with experiments using an impedance analyzer and a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. For both experiments, the lug specimen is excited and measured using a piezoelectric active wafer sensor in a frequency range of 1kHz-100kHz. The dynamic response of both numerical calculations and experimental measurements show good agreement. To identify (i.e., detect, locate, and quantify) cracks in necked lugs a two-step analysis is performed. In the first step, a crack is detected data-based by calculating damage metrics between pristine and damaged state frequency spectra and comparing the resulting values to a pre-defined threshold. In the second step the location and size of the detected crack is identified by evaluation of specific resonance frequency shifts of the necked lug. Both the search for frequencies sensitive to through-cracks that allow a distinction between the two critical locations and the evaluation of the crack size are model-based.

{"title": "Identification and functional characterization of the Piezo1 channel pore domain.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells convert physical forces into electrochemical responses. On a molecular scale, these forces are detected by mechanically activated ion channels, which constitute the basis for hearing, touch, pain, cold, and heat sensation, among other physiological processes. Exciting high-resolution structural details of these channels are currently emerging that will eventually allow us to delineate the molecular determinants of gating and ion permeation. However, our structural-functional understanding across the family remains limited. Piezo1 is one of the largest and least understood of these channels, with various structurally identified features within its trimeric assembly. This study seeks to determine the modularity and function of Piezo1 channels by constructing deletion proteins guided by cryo EM structural knowledge. Our comprehensive functional study identified, for the first time, the minimal amino acid sequence of the full-length Piezo1 that can fold and function as the channel's pore domain between E2172 and the last residue E2547. While the addition of an anchor region has no effect on permeation properties. The Piezo1 pore domain is not pressure-sensitive and the appending of Piezo Repeat-A did not restore pressure-dependent gating, hence the sensing module must exist between residues 1 to 1952. Our efforts delineating the permeation and gating regions within this complex ion channel have implications in identifying small molecules that exclusively regulate the activity of the channel's pore module to influence mechanotransduction and downstream processes.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2020-12-29", "authors": ["Elena DNosyreva", "DavidThompson", "RuhmaSyeda"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.RA120.015905"}

{"title": "Time Reverse Modeling of Damage Detection in Underwater Concrete Beams Using Piezoelectric Intelligent Modules.", "abstract": "Underwater cracks in concrete structures are often difficult to detect due to their complexity of the service environment. With numerical and experimental analysis of concrete beams immersed in water, an active monitoring system, based on a cement-based piezoelectric intelligent module array (CPIMA), was developed to locate and quantify the underwater cracks. Time reversal (TR) of the stress wave field is accomplished to focus on the crack area through the concrete beam specimen by the system. First, a piezoelectric actuator is applied to emit the initial propagating wave, which can be reflected, attenuated, and diffracted by the crack, transmitted through water filled in the crack, as well as diffracted by the coarse aggregates. To extract the damage waveforms associated with the crack and analyze the robust time-reversal invariance under the high-order multiple scattering effect, a pair of homogeneous and heterogeneous forward finite element (FE) models is established. Then, the damage waveforms are time-reversed and re-propagated in the inverse numerical model, where an optimal refocusing is achieved on the crack that behaves as an acoustic source.

However, the absence of a robust technique to synchronously scan both AFM and confocal microscope piezo stages makes it difficult to visualize force-induced changes in fluorescent protein distribution in cells.\u00a0 To address this challenge, we have built an integrated AFM-confocal fluorescence microscope platform that implements a synchronous scanning method which eliminates image artifacts from piezo motion ramping, produces accurate pixel binning and enables the collection of a scanned image of a sample while applying force to a single point on the sample.

{"title": "Piezo2 channel in nodose ganglia neurons is essential in controlling hypertension in a pathway regulated directly by Nedd4-2.", "abstract": "Baroreflex plays a crucial role in regulation of arterial blood pressure (BP). Recently, Piezo1 and Piezo2, the mechanically-activated (MA) ion channels, have been identified as baroreceptors. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for regulating these baroreceptors in hypertension remains unknown. In this study, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and NG-Nitro-l-Arginine (L-NNA)- and Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertensive model rats to determine the role and mechanism of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in hypertension. We found that Piezo2 was dominantly expressed in baroreceptor nodose ganglia (NG) neurons and aortic nerve endings in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The expression of Piezo2 not Piezo1 was significantly downregulated in these regions in SHR and hypertensive model rats. Electrophysiological results showed that the rapidly adapting mechanically-activated (RA-MA) currents and the responsive neuron numbers were significantly reduced in baroreceptor NG neurons in SHR. In WKY rats, the arterial BP was elevated by knocking down the expression of Piezo2 or inhibiting MA channel activity by GsMTx4 in NG. Knockdown of Piezo2 in NG also attenuated the baroreflex and increased serum norepinephrine (NE) concentration in WKY rats. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment suggested that Piezo2 interacted with Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4 type 2 (Nedd4-2, also known as Nedd4L); Electrophysiological results showed that Nedd4-2 inhibited Piezo2 MA currents in co-expressed HEK293T cells. Additionally, Nedd4-2 was upregulated in NG baroreceptor neurons in SHR. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Piezo2 not Piezo1 may act as baroreceptor to regulate arterial BP in rats. Nedd4-2 induced downregulation of Piezo2 in baroreceptor NG neurons leads to hypertension in rats. Our findings provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism for the regulation of baroreceptor Piezo2 and its critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2020-12-23", "authors": ["LifangHuo", "YitingGao", "DongfangZhang", "ShengnanWang", "YuHan", "HongchaoMen", "ZuxiaoYang", "XiaQin", "RiWang", "DezhiKong", "HuiBai", "HailinZhang", "WeiZhang", "ZhanfengJia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105391"}
{"title": "Real-time device tracking under MRI using an acousto-optic active marker.", "abstract": "This work aims to demonstrate the use of an \"active\" acousto-optic marker with enhanced visibility and reduced radiofrequency (RF) -induced heating for interventional MRI.\nThe acousto-optic marker was fabricated using bulk piezoelectric crystal and \u03c0-phase shifted fiber Bragg grating (FBGs) and coupled to a distal receiver coil on an 8F catheter. The received MR signal is transmitted over an optical fiber to mitigate RF-induced heating. A photodetector converts the optical signal into electrical signal, which is used as the input signal to the MRI receiver plug. Acousto-optic markers were characterized in phantom studies. RF-induced heating risk was evaluated according to ASTM 2182 standard. In vivo real-time tracking capability was tested in an animal model under a 0.55T scanner.\nSignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels suitable for real-time tracking were obtained by using high sensitivity FBG and piezoelectric transducer with resonance matched to Larmor frequency. Single and multiple marker coils integrated to 8F catheters were readout for position and orientation tracking by a single acousto-optic sensor. RF-induced heating was significantly reduced compared to a coax cable connected reference marker. Real-time distal tip tracking of an active device was demonstrated in an animal model with a standard real-time cardiac MR sequence.\nAcousto-optic markers provide sufficient SNR with a simple structure for real-time device tracking.

{"title": "Boron Nitride Nanotube (BNNT) Membranes for Energy and Environmental Applications.", "abstract": "Owing to their extraordinary thermal, mechanical, optical, and electrical properties, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have been attracting considerable attention in various scientific fields, making it more promising as a nanomaterial compared to other nanotubes. Recent studies reported that BNNTs exhibit better properties than carbon nanotubes, which have been extensively investigated for most environment-energy applications. Irrespective of its chirality, BNNT is a constant wide-bandgap insulator, exhibiting thermal oxidation resistance, piezoelectric properties, high hydrogen adsorption, ultraviolet luminescence, cytocompatibility, and stability. These unique properties of BNNT render it an exceptional material for separation applications, e.g., membranes. Recent studies reported that water filtration, gas separation, sensing, and battery separator membranes can considerably benefit from these properties. That is, flux, rejection, anti-fouling, sensing, structural, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of membranes can be enhanced by the contribution of BNNTs.

{"title": "Enhanced Piezoelectric Properties of Poly(Vinylidenefluoride-Co-Trifluoroethylene)/Carbon-Based Nanomaterial Composite Films for Pressure Sensing Applications.", "abstract": "In this study, heat and polarization treatments were applied to poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) films to improve their crystallinity and piezoelectric effect. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) of multiple dimensions (i.e., modified zero-dimensional (0D) carbon black (OCB), one-dimensional (1D) modified carbon nanotubes (CNT-COOH) and two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO)) were added to the copolymer to study the effects of different CBN dimensions on the crystallinity and piezoelectric effect of PVDF-TrFE films. Additionally, amphiphilic polymeric dispersants were added to improve the dispersibility of CBNs; the dispersant was synthesized by the amidation, and imidization reactions of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer (SMAz) and polyoxyalkylene amine (M1000). Polymer solutions with different ratios of CBN to dispersant (z = 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10) were prepared. The enhanced dispersibility enabled the fluorine atoms in the PVDF-TrFE molecular chain to more efficiently form hydrogen bonds with the -COOH group in the CBN, thereby increasing the content of the \u03b2 crystal phase (the origin of the piezoelectric effect) of the film. Therefore, the resulting film exhibited a higher output voltage on the application side and better sensitivity on the sensing element. The addition of CNT-COOH and polymeric dispersants increased the \u03b2-phase content in PVDF-TrFE from 73.6% to 86.4%, which in turn raised the piezoelectric coefficient from 19.8 \u00b1 1.0 to 26.4 \u00b1 1.3 pC/N.

{"title": "Engineering inclined orientations of piezoelectric films for integrated acoustofluidics and lab-on-a-chip operated in liquid environments.", "abstract": "Different acoustic wave modes are required for effective implementation of biosensing and liquid actuation functions in an acoustic wave-based lab-on-a-chip. For efficient sensing in liquids, shear waves (either a thickness-shear bulk wave or a shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave) can achieve a high sensitivity, without significant loss of acoustic wave energy. On the other hand, longitudinal bulk waves or out-of-plane displacement waves (such as Rayleigh waves) enable efficient sampling functions and liquid manipulation. However, there are significant challenges in developing a lab-on-a-chip to efficiently generate multiple wave modes and perform both these functions on a single piezoelectric substrate, especially when a single crystalline orientation is available. This paper highlights the latest progress in the theories and techniques to deliver both sensing and microfluidic manipulation functions using engineered inclined-angled piezoelectric films, allowing for the simultaneous generation of longitudinal (or Rayleigh) and thickness-shear bulk (or shear-horizontal surface acoustic) waves. Challenges and theoretical constraints for generating various wave modes in the inclined films and techniques to efficiently produce inclined columnar and inclined crystalline piezoelectric films using sputtering deposition methods are presented. Applications of different wave modes in the inclined film-based lab-on-chips with multiple sensing and acoustofluidic functions are also discussed.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2020-12-19", "authors": ["Yong-QingFu", "Hua-FengPang", "HamdiTorun", "RanTao", "GlenMcHale", "JulienReboud", "KaiTao", "JianZhou", "JingtingLuo", "DesmondGibson", "JikuiLuo", "PingAnHu"], "doi": "10.1039/d0lc00887g"}
{"title": "Free volume dependence of dielectric behaviour in sandwich-structured high dielectric performances of poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite films.", "abstract": "A dielectric film with a trilayer structure is fabricated to obtain both a high dielectric constant and superior electrical breakdown strength simultaneously. The outer layers of the trilayered composite film are composed of barium titanate (BTO) particles dispersed in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to ensure a relatively high dielectric constant, while the central layer of the composite film consists of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) dispersed in PVDF to provide high electrical breakdown strength. Compared with pristine PVDF, the dielectric constant and breakdown strength are simultaneously enhanced due to the sandwich structure, and the dielectric loss is maintained at a low level. Most important of all, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is applied to study the atomic-scale free volume holes of PVDF composite films and the effect of free volume holes on the dielectric constant and breakdown strength. Results show that the size of free volume holes of PVDF increased with the addition of BTO, but it decreased firstly and then increased with the BNNS loading. The correlation between dielectric properties and the size of free volume holes of the PVDF matrix was discussed in each layer. It is illustrated that the experimental dielectric constant of the PVDF/BTO single-layered film is consistent with the theoretical value at a lower BTO loading but smaller than the theoretical value at a higher BTO loading, which is probably ascribed to the increased size of free volume holes. The breakdown strength of the PVDF/BNNS film increased with the introduction of BNNS and the reduced size of free volume holes, which is ascribed to the reduced partial discharge phenomenon. The atomic-scale microstructure analysis based on free volume holes provides valuable ideas and new understanding for the study of the mechanism of the dielectric behaviour of polymer composites.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2020-12-19", "authors": ["LeiYang", "LanqiongYang", "KunMa", "YuWang", "TongSong", "LiliangGong", "JianSun", "LingZhao", "ZhihongYang", "JianmeiXu", "QingWang", "GuogangLi", "WeiZhou"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nr06070d"}

{"title": "Effect of Filler Synergy and Cast Film Extrusion Parameters on Extrudability and Direction-Dependent Conductivity of PVDF/Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Black Composites.", "abstract": "In the present study, melt-mixed composites based of poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and fillers with different aspect ratios (carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon black (CB)) and their mixtures in composites were investigated whereby compression-molded plates were compared with melt-extruded films. The processing-related orientation of CNTs with a high aspect ratio leads to direction-dependent electrical and mechanical properties, which can be reduced by using mixed filler systems with the low aspect ratio CB. An upscaling of melt mixing from small scale to laboratory scale was carried out. From extruded materials, films were prepared down to a thickness of 50 \u00b5m by cast film extrusion under variation of the processing parameters. By combining CB and CNTs in PVDF, especially the electrical conductivity through the film could be increased compared to PVDF/CNT composites due to additional contact points in the sample thickness. The alignment of the fillers in the two directions within the films was deduced from the differences in electrical and mechanical film properties, which showed higher values in the extrusion direction than perpendicular to it.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2020-12-19", "authors": ["BeateKrause", "KarinaKunz", "BerndKretzschmar", "InesK\u00fchnert", "PetraP\u00f6tschke"], "doi": "10.3390/polym12122992\n10.1016/S0266-3538(01)00094-X\n10.1002/pc.20058\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.10.063\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.12.024\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.05.037\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.06.010\n10.1002/adfm.200700065\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.02.029\n10.1071/CH09131\n10.1063/1.5084884\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.06.003\n10.3139/217.900272\n10.1002/app.42665\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.01.007\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.12.019\n10.1016/j.polymer.2013.04.012\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.07.007\n10.1002/pi.4270\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2013.01.015\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.05.062\n10.3390/batteries6040060\n10.1177/0021998310378905\n10.3390/polym11040591\n10.14314/polimery.2012.204\n10.1016/j.carbon.2014.01.001\n10.1021/am9000503\n10.1002/pi.5378\n10.1021/acsami.6b03451\n10.1007/s00289-012-0893-9\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.03.004\n10.1080/09506608.2019.1582180\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2018.09.027\n10.1016/j.polymer.2013.08.010\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.11.015\n10.1016/j.polymer.2018.11.010\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.07.021\n10.1081/FST-200039267\n10.3390/polym11020189\n10.1002/app.30418\n10.1021/acsami.6b13074\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.06.011\n10.1007/s10853-020-05099-z"}
{"title": "A peritoneal defect covered by intraperitoneal mesh prosthesis effects an increased and distinctive foreign body reaction in a minipig model.", "abstract": "The incidence of incisional hernia is with up to 30% one of the frequent long-term complication after laparotomy. After establishing minimal invasive operations, the laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique (lap. IPOM) was first described in 1993. Little is known about the foreign body reaction of IPOM-meshes, which covered a defect of the parietal peritoneum. This is becoming more important, since IPOM procedure with peritoneal-sac resection and hernia port closing (IPOM plus) is more frequently used.\nIn 18 female minipigs, two out of three Polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) -meshes (I: standard IPOM; II: IPOM with modified structure [bigger pores]; III: IPOM with the same structure as IPOM II\u2009+\u2009degradable hydrogel-coating) were placed in a laparoscopic IPOM procedure. Before mesh placement, a 2x2cm peritoneal defect was created. After 30\u2009days, animals were euthanized, adhesions were evaluated by re-laparoscopy and mesh samples were explanted for histological and immunohistochemichal investigations.\nAll animals recovered after implantation and had no complications during the follow-up period. Analysing foreign body reaction, the IPOM II mesh had a significant smaller inner granuloma, compared to the other meshes (IPOM II: 8.4\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 vs. IPOM I 9.1\u2009\u00b5m\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The degradable hydrogel coating does not prevent adhesions measured by Diamond score (p\u2009=\u20090.46). A peritoneal defect covered by a standard or modified IPOM mesh was a significant factor for increasing foreign body granuloma, the amount of CD3+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages and decrease of pore size.\nA peritoneal defect covered by IPOM prostheses leads to an increased foreign body reaction compared to intact peritoneum. Whenever feasible, a peritoneal defect should be closed accurately before placing an IPOM-mesh to avoid an excessive foreign body reaction and therefore inferior biomaterial properties of the prosthesis.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2020-12-18", "authors": ["Roman MariusEickhoff", "AndreasKroh", "SimonEickhoff", "DanielHeise", "Marius JulianHelmedag", "Rene HTolba", "UweKlinge", "Ulf PeterNeumann", "Christian DanielKlink", "AndreasLambertz"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328220963918"}

We compared five membrane filters for bioaerosol sampling-mixed cellulose ester (MCE), polyethersulfone (PES), polyamide (PA), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based on their bacterial, fungal and eukaryotic DNA recoveries.\nBacterial, fungal and eukaryotic populations were quantified using quantitative PCR. With a bacterial consortium, PTFE exhibited the best recovery efficiency (113%), followed by PA (92%), PES (86%), MCE (48%) and PVDF (1%). When filters were compared with air, PA was used as a control to normalize results from the others. The bacterial, fungal and eukaryotic DNA recovery ratios were markedly greater in PES (9\u00b73, 11\u00b75 and 10\u00b73 respectively) than in the remaining. Eukaryotic MiSeq sequencing revealed that PES recovered a more diverse and considerably richer assemblage (richness ratios, 4\u00b797 vs\u00a0\u2264\u00a01\u00b716 for PES vs the others). Rank abundance distribution analysis showed that distribution tails were longer (>4 times) in PES, but these did not differ between the remaining and PA.

{"title": "Damage Identification in Plate Structures Using Sparse Regularization Based Electromechanical Impedance Technique.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel structural damage quantification approach using a sparse regularization based electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique. Minor structural damage in plate structures by using the measurement of only a single surface bonded lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT) transducer was quantified. To overcome the limitations of using model-based EMI based methods in damage detection of complex or relatively large-scale structures, a three-dimensional finite element model for simulating the PZT-structure interaction is developed and calibrated with experimental results. Based on the sensitivities of the resonance frequency shifts of the impedance responses with respect to the physical parameters of plate structures, sparse regularization was applied to conduct the undetermined inverse identification of structural damage. The difference between the measured and analytically obtained impedance responses was calculated and used for identification. In this study, only a limited number of the resonance frequency shifts were obtained from the selected frequency range for damage identification of plate structures with numerous elements.

This approach is effective in terms of reducing the intraocular pressure via the filtering of intraocular fluid from the anterior chamber into the drainage pathways. The basic properties of such implants comprise of long-term stability and the filtering of fluids without the occurrence of undesirable blockages. This study describes the design and production of a novel material for the treatment of glaucoma disease that is based on electrospinning technology. Non-toxic, biocompatible and non-degradable polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) was selected as the implant material. The research investigated the resistance of this material to the growth of a fibroblast cell line without the use of antifibrotic agents such as mitomycin C. Three different types of PVDF were electrospun separately and mixed with polyethyleneoxide (PEO), following which the degree of cell growth resistance was evaluated. It was discovered that the fiber layers that contained PVDF blended with PEO evinced a statistically significant difference in metabolic activity compared to the PURE PVDF layers. Only small cell clusters formed on the layers that were resistant to cell fibrotization. As a result of the observed clustering, a new program was developed in MATLAB software for the determination of the number of cells involved in cluster formation, which then allowed for the determination of the spatial dependence between the cells in the form of a point pattern.

Initially, unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)-based simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic forces under different conditions. An adaptive differential evolution (JADE) multivariable optimization algorithm was used for the power calculations. After JADE optimization, a communication cycle was designed. The shield works in two modes: communication and power saving. The power-saving mode is active for 285 s and the communication mode for 15 s. This cycle consumes a determinate amount of power, which requires a specific piezoelectric material and, in some situations, an extra power device, such as a battery or supercapacitor. The piezoelectric device is able to work at the maximum power point using a specific Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) H-bridge controlled with a relay action. For the extra power supply, a bidirectional buck-boost converter was implemented to flow the energy in both directions. This electronic circuit was simulated to compare the extra power supply and the piezoelectric energy harvester behavior.

Our works show that VSi2P4 in the FMS phase with intrinsic piezoelectric properties can have potential applications in spin electronic devices.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2020-12-11", "authors": ["San-DongGuo", "Wen-QiMu", "Yu-TongZhu", "Xing-QiuChen"], "doi": "10.1039/d0cp05273f"}
{"title": "Data relating to mems piezoelectric micro power harvester physical parameter optimization, for extremely low frequency and low vibration level applications.", "abstract": "In this paper, the performance of Piezoelectric Micro Power Harvester (PMPH), which converts mechanical vibrations into electrical power via piezoelectric effect is measured based on L18 Orthogonal Array (OA) and Taguchi optimization methods, where 18 experiments are conducted instead of the trial and error approach. Eight control parameters are selected to study the proposed PMPH in the three levels. COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 simulation software is used to examine all models in frequency and transient response analysis. MINITAB statistical software is used to analyse the simulation data through Taguchi tools and ANOVA test. The control factor, it is found, has more positive bearing on PMPH performance that has the higher delta function in Taguchi, and higher percentage in ANOVA. This method will hopefully reduce time needed in optimizing PMPH and in maintaining the material resources necessary in the fabrication process let alone cost saving [1].", "journal": "Data in brief", "date": "2020-12-11", "authors": ["Mohd H SAlrashdan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.dib.2020.106571\n10.1016/j.mejo.2020.104894"}
{"title": "A \"Graft to\" Electrospun Zwitterionic Bilayer Membrane for the Separation of Hydraulic Fracturing-Produced Water via Membrane Distillation.", "abstract": "Simultaneous fouling and pore wetting of the membrane during membrane distillation (MD) is a major concern. In this work, an electrospun bilayer membrane for enhancing fouling and wetting resistance has been developed for treating hydraulic fracture-produced water (PW) by MD. These PWs can contain over 200,000 ppm total dissolved solids, organic compounds and surfactants. The membrane consists of an omniphobic surface that faces the permeate stream and a hydrophilic surface that faces the feed stream. The omniphobic surface was decorated by growing nanoparticles, followed by silanization to lower the surface energy. An epoxied zwitterionic polymer was grafted onto the membrane surface that faces the feed stream to form a tight antifouling hydration layer. The membrane was challenged with an aqueous NaCl solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an ampholyte and crude oil. In the presence of SDS and crude oil, the membrane was stable and displayed salt rejection (>99.9%). Further, the decrease was much less than the base polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) electrospun membrane. The membranes were also challenged with actual PW. Our results highlight the importance of tuning the properties of the membrane surface that faces the feed and permeate streams in order to maximize membrane stability, flux and salt rejection.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-12-11", "authors": ["Yu-HsuanChiao", "Micah Belle MarieYap Ang", "Yu-XiHuang", "Sandrina SvetlanaDePaz", "YungChang", "JorgeAlmodovar", "S RanilWickramasinghe"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10120402\n10.1016/j.fuel.2016.05.051\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.114090\n10.1021/acs.est.6b03882\n10.3390/ijerph16050685\n10.1021/acsami.6b02419\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.019\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.09.036\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.11.030\n10.1039/C8EE00291F\n10.1021/ie50320a024\n10.1073/pnas.0804872105\n10.1021/am302790d\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.03.164\n10.1021/acs.est.7b02848\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.12.079\n10.1038/am.2014.34\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.06.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.06.053\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.12.043\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00562\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b02164\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117188\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.12.063\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117196\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.09.079\n10.1021/am404780w\n10.3390/polym12061303\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.002\n10.1039/C4TC02183E\n10.1126/science.1148326\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.03.046\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.023\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.07.008\n10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.022\n10.3390/polym12020269\n10.1039/D0EE00341G\n10.1016/j.desal.2016.07.045"}

{"title": "Spectral fingerprinting to evaluate effects of storage conditions on biomolecular structure of filter-dried saliva samples and recovered DNA.", "abstract": "Saliva has been widely recognized as a non-invasive, painless and easy-to-collect bodily fluid, which contains biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis of both oral and systemic diseases. Under ambient conditions, salivary biomarkers are subject to degradation. Therefore, in order to minimize degradation during transport and storage, saliva specimens need to be stabilized. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of preserving saliva samples by drying to provide a shelf-stable source of DNA. Human saliva was dried on filters under ambient conditions using sucrose as lyoprotective agent. Samples were stored under different conditions, i.e. varying relative humidity (RH) and temperature. In addition to assessment of different cell types in saliva and their DNA contents, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to evaluate the effects of storage on biomolecular structure characteristics of saliva. FTIR analysis showed that saliva dried without a lyoprotectant exhibits a higher content of extended \u03b2-sheet protein secondary structures compared to samples that were dried with sucrose. In order to evaluate differences in characteristic bands arising from the DNA backbone among differently stored samples, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, allowing a clear discrimination between groups with/without sucrose as well as storage durations and conditions. Our results indicated that saliva dried on filters in the presence of sucrose exhibits higher biomolecular stability during storage.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-12-10", "authors": ["RaffaeleBrogna", "Harri\u00ebtteOldenhof", "HaraldSieme", "Willem FWolkers"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-78306-1\n10.1177/154407370501800105\n10.1128/cmr.00021-13\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.10.026\n10.1111/j.1399-302x.1995.tb00143.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033968\n10.1111/j.1601-0825.2005.01187.x\n10.4103/0976-9668.82322\n10.1007/s12032-016-0863-4\n10.3892/mmr.1.3.375\n10.1002/bmc.3193\n10.3390/ijms17030343\n10.1016/0011-2240(90)90023\n10.1016/j.xphs.2016.11.003\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2004.02.011\n10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb08669.x\n10.1146/annurev.food.102308.124139\n10.1039/c1an15821j\n10.1038/sj.bmt.1701815\n10.1038/s41598-018-25311-0\n10.1038/sj.bmt.1702170\n10.1016/s0009-8981(02)00062-1\n10.1515/rrlm-2016-0011\n10.1038/nrg3405\n10.1002/ajmg.b.32278\n10.1016/0304-4165(87)90133-4\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-060418-052130\n10.1093/icb/45.5.810\n10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.11.016\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.04.003\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.12.004\n10.1089/cpt.2007.0511\n10.4103/0250-474X.103837\n10.2174/1874120701105010047\n10.2174/156720111797635450\n10.1211/0022357011777774\n10.1007/s11095-014-1394-3\n10.1111/1556-4029.14112\n10.1186/s12920-016-0172-y\n10.3791/51697\n10.1097/ede.0000000000000120\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.01.024\n10.1016/s0301-4622(03)00035-8\n10.1093/nar/gkr175\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02744\n10.1088/0031-9155/48/2/307\n10.1371/journal.pone.0043169\n10.1366/0003702011953720\n10.1039/c8ay00386f"}
{"title": "Design of a resonant Luneburg lens for surface acoustic waves.", "abstract": "In this work we employ additive manufacturing to print a circular array of micropillars on an aluminium slab turning its top surface into a graded index metasurface for surface acoustic waves (SAW). The graded metasurface reproduces a Luneburg lens capable of focusing plane SAWs to a point. The graded index profile is obtained by exploiting the dispersion properties of the metasurface arising from the well-known resonant coupling between the micropillars (0.5\u00a0mm diameter and variable length \u223c3\u00a0mm) and the surface waves propagating in the substrate. From the analytical formulation of the metasurface's dispersion curves, a slow phase velocity mode is shown to arise from the hybridisation of the surface wave with the pillar resonance. This is used to compute the radial height profile corresponding to the refractive index given by Luneburg's equation. An initial validation of the lens design, achieved through ray theory, shows that ray trajectories have a strong frequency dependence, meaning that the lens will only work on a narrow band. An ultrasonic experiment at 500 kHz where plane SAWs are generated with a piezoelectric transducer and a laser scanner measures the out of plane displacement on the metasurface, validates the actual lens performance and the manufacturing technique. Finally, comparison between the ray analysis and experimental results offers insight into the behaviour of this type of metasurface especially in the proximity of the acoustic bandgaps and highlights the possibility for acoustic shielding.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-12-09", "authors": ["RafaelFuentes-Dom\u00ednguez", "MengtingYao", "AndreaColombi", "PaulDryburgh", "DonPieris", "AlexanderJackson-Crisp", "DanielColquitt", "AdamClare", "Richard JSmith", "MattClark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106306"}
{"title": "Composites, Fabrication and Application of Polyvinylidene Fluoride for Flexible Electromechanical Devices: A Review.", "abstract": "The technological development of piezoelectric materials is crucial for developing wearable and flexible electromechanical devices. There are many inorganic materials with piezoelectric effects, such as piezoelectric ceramics, aluminum nitride and zinc oxide. They all have very high piezoelectric coefficients and large piezoelectric response ranges. The characteristics of high hardness and low tenacity make inorganic piezoelectric materials unsuitable for flexible devices that require frequent bending. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its derivatives are the most popular materials used in flexible electromechanical devices in recent years and have high flexibility, high sensitivity, high ductility and a certain piezoelectric coefficient. Owing to increasing the piezoelectric coefficient of PVDF, researchers are committed to optimizing PVDF materials and enhancing their polarity by a series of means to further improve their mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency. This paper reviews the latest PVDF-related optimization-based materials, related processing and polarization methods and the applications of these materials in, e.g., wearable functional devices, chemical sensors, biosensors and flexible actuator devices for flexible micro-electromechanical devices. We also discuss the challenges of wearable devices based on flexible piezoelectric polymer, considering where further practical applications could be.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-12-09", "authors": ["ShuaibingGuo", "XuexinDuan", "MengyingXie", "Kean ChinAw", "QiannanXue"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11121076\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1958.tb12903.x\n10.1007/s00542-018-3807-4\n10.1016/j.mee.2020.111333\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.10.025\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.080\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/11/115025\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2013.04.015\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.06.011\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106695\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.210\n10.1021/acsaelm.0c00272\n10.1007/s00339-020-03698-w\n10.3390/s20113111\n10.1021/acsami.9b18555\n10.3390/s18103224\n10.1557/mrs.2018.180\n10.1007/s10853-009-3643-0\n10.1007/s12541-011-0151-3\n10.1016/j.physb.2008.06.020\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111575\n10.1039/D0QM00288G\n10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.028\n10.1002/smsc.202000011\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1232582\n10.1007/s12274-015-0718-x\n10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106157\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.090\n10.1039/C5CS00812C\n10.1002/0471216275.esm063\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1021/cr800187m\n10.1039/C8EE03006E\n10.1039/c1jm11445j\n10.1080/10236660802190963\n10.1039/C5RA16604G\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025003\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2008.03.016\n10.1002/marc.201500410\n10.1021/nl9040719\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.04.016\n10.1063/1.4937733\n10.1021/ma302679g\n10.1063/1.5019319\n10.1016/j.tsf.2010.09.042\n10.1039/C4RA16360E\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.03.038\n10.1039/C3EE43987A\n10.1002/adma.201100054\n10.1038/nmat2951\n10.1021/nl103094e\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.148\n10.1115/1.4034613\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2020.122639\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2019.106001\n10.1039/D0SM01031F\n10.1166/mex.2017.1393\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.03.007\n10.1021/acsami.5b01760\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.02.001\n10.1063/1.2967335\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02580.x\n10.1063/1.1978985\n10.1007/s00339-009-5189-z\n10.1038/35002022\n10.1103/PhysRevB.72.064116\n10.1021/cm010998c\n10.1002/anie.200290049\n10.1126/science.1129564\n10.1142/S0217979203022441\n10.1063/1.4812472\n10.1016/j.matlet.2012.12.067\n10.1063/1.1487435\n10.1007/s10832-014-9939-8\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085017\n10.1039/C4RA07379G\n10.1039/D0SM00341G\n10.1021/nl0602701\n10.1039/c3nr03094f\n10.5772/62433\n10.1016/j.matlet.2014.08.139\n10.1038/srep07887\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.012\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.09.117\n10.1021/acsami.8b19824\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.03.001\n10.1016/j.orgel.2017.07.035\n10.1002/jbm.b.33778\n10.1002/marc.200700544\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.09.019\n10.1007/s11837-018-2811-6\n10.1080/00222348.2014.983853\n10.1021/acsami.6b01547\n10.1021/acsami.9b18823\n10.1038/nnano.2008.67\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.115402\n10.1002/adfm.201303135\n10.1007/s11468-015-0175-0\n10.1038/srep05517\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/4/045026\n10.3390/polym9020033\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.00016.x\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.09.030\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2182043\n10.1007/s00339-016-0161-1\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111912\n10.1080/00150193.2017.1295430\n10.1063/1.4997446\n10.1038/ncomms13566\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111789\n10.1021/acsami.5b04161\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1016/j.polymer.2012.01.058\n10.1021/ma202481t\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.08.019\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.291\n10.1016/j.matdes.2019.108025\n10.1002/advs.201900290\n10.1115/1.4042570\n10.1063/1.5025025\n10.1002/pen.24088\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.057\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111841\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.053\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab15b7\n10.1021/acsami.7b04095\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa738e\n10.1177/0021998317704709\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.08.053\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108425\n10.3390/mi10070438\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.117385\n10.1002/admt.201900900\n10.3390/nano9040555\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.11.036\n10.1002/adma.200400719\n10.3390/s140609889\n10.1021/bm015533u\n10.1039/c2jm31618h\n10.1002/mame.201700229\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.07.058\n10.1016/j.orgel.2016.05.034\n10.1109/TED.2010.2102631\n10.5664/jcsm.6458\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2982532\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.10.105\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.03.001\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.03.034\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.08.125\n10.1007/s10904-018-0856-1\n10.1109/LED.2017.2701879\n10.1080/15421400601028492\n10.1149/2.0241606jes\n10.1163/156856208X396047\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.253\n10.1126/scirobotics.aax1594\n10.1021/acsami.5b04578\n10.1002/advs.201500438\n10.1115/1.4032407"}

The composite piezoelectric property is achieved from the dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the magnetostrictive property from Terfenol-D nanoparticles. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to examine the feasibility of modelling the piezoelectric (change in electric field) and magnetostrictive (change in magnetic field) self-sensing responses in the presence of applied stress. The numerical work was coupled with a series of mechanical tests to characterize the piezoelectric response, magnetostriction response and mechanical strength. Tensile tests of the composite samples manufactured as is (virgin), samples with SWCNTs, samples with Terfenol-D nanoparticles and samples with both SWCNTs and Terfenol-D nanoparticles were conducted. It was observed that an increase in volume fraction of Terfenol-d nanoparticles increases the change in magnetization, therefore increasing voltage response up to the point of saturation. The optimum change in amplitude was observed with 0.35% volume fraction of Terfenol-D nanoparticles. A constant ratio of SWCNTs was maintained, and maximum change in electrical resistance was at 7.4%. Fracture toughness for the samples with all nanoparticles was explored, and the results showed improved resistance to crack propagation.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-12-09", "authors": ["Relebohile GeorgeQhobosheane", "Muthu Ram PrabhuElenchezhian", "Partha PratimDas", "MinhazurRahman", "Monjur MorshedRabby", "VamseeVadlamudi", "KennethReifsnider", "RasselRaihan"], "doi": "10.3390/s20236906\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.09.083\n10.3390/s18020609\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.02.020\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119717\n10.1038/s41598-020-65771-x\n10.3390/ma11030406\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad8c5\n10.12783/shm2019/32238\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2019333\n10.1090/S0025-5718-2014-02807-X\n10.1007/s12043-017-1398-8\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.02.119\n10.1063/1.4916810\n10.1177/1687814015573761\n10.1177/1081286518810741\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.08.003\n10.1063/1.373133\n10.1063/1.2405013\n10.1016/j.carbon.2008.08.010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.016"}

The results indicate that before M \u2265 7.0 global earthquakes, there are clearly higher probabilities of geomagnetic storms than after them. Geomagnetic storms are more likely to be related with shallow earthquakes rather than deep ones. Further statistical investigations of the results based on cumulative storm hours show consistency with those based on storm days, suggesting that the high probability of geomagnetic storms prior to large-mega earthquakes is significant and robust. Some possible mechanisms such as a reverse piezoelectric effect and/or electroosmotic flow are discussed to explain the statistical correlation.

{"title": "Acoustic Energy Release During the Laboratory Seismic Cycle: Insights on Laboratory Earthquake Precursors and Prediction.", "abstract": "Machine learning can predict the timing and magnitude of laboratory earthquakes using statistics of acoustic emissions. The evolution of acoustic energy is critical for lab earthquake prediction; however, the connections between acoustic energy and fault zone processes leading to failure are poorly understood. Here, we document in detail the temporal evolution of acoustic energy during the laboratory seismic cycle. We report on friction experiments for a range of shearing velocities, normal stresses, and granular particle sizes. Acoustic emission data are recorded continuously throughout shear using broadband piezo-ceramic sensors. The coseismic acoustic energy release scales directly with stress drop and is consistent with concepts of frictional contact mechanics and time-dependent fault healing. Experiments conducted with larger grains (10.5\u00a0\u03bcm) show that the temporal evolution of acoustic energy scales directly with fault slip rate. In particular, the acoustic energy is low when the fault is locked and increases to a maximum during coseismic failure. Data from traditional slide-hold-slide friction tests confirm that acoustic energy release is closely linked to fault slip rate. Furthermore, variations in the true contact area of fault zone particles play a key role in the generation of acoustic energy. Our data show that acoustic radiation is related primarily to breaking/sliding of frictional contact junctions, which suggests that machine learning-based laboratory earthquake prediction derives from frictional weakening processes that begin very early in the seismic cycle and well before macroscopic failure.", "journal": "Journal of geophysical research.

This novel adsorbent material can be used to selectively remove MO on a wide pH range (3.0-10.0), with a maximum capacity of 143.8\u00a0mg/g at pH 3.0. When used in a recirculating filtration system, the maximum absorption capacity was reached in a shorter time (20\u00a0min) than that observed for batch mode experiments (360\u00a0min). Based on the analyses of the kinetics and adsorption isotherm data, one can conclude that the predominant mechanism of interaction between the membrane and the dissolved dye molecules is electrostatic. Besides, considering the estimated values for the Gibbs energy, and entropy and enthalpy changes, it was established that the adsorption process is spontaneous and occurs in an endothermic manner. The good mechanical and environmental stability of these membranes allowed their use in at least 20 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles, without significant loss of their characteristics.

{"title": "Inducing different severities of traumatic brain injury in Drosophila using a piezoelectric actuator.", "abstract": "Drosophila models have been instrumental in providing insights into molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, with wide application to human disease. The brain degeneration associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been modeled in Drosophila using devices that inflict trauma on multiple parts of the fly body, including the head. However, the injuries produced by these models are not specific in location and are inconsistent between individual animals. We have recently developed a device that can be used to inflict controlled head injury to flies, resulting in physiological responses that are remarkably similar to those observed in humans with TBI. This protocol describes the construction, calibration and use of the Drosophila TBI (dTBI) device, a platform that employs a piezoelectric actuator to reproducibly deliver a force in order to briefly compress the fly head against a metal surface. The extent of head compression can be controlled through an electrical circuit, allowing the operator to set different levels of injury. The entire device can be assembled and calibrated in under a week. The device components and the necessary electrical tools are readily available and cost ~$800.

{"title": "The effect of thermal treatment on ac/dc conductivity and current fluctuations of PVDF/NMP/[EMIM][TFSI] solid polymer electrolyte.", "abstract": "The experimental study deals with the investigation of the effect of diverse crystallinity of imidazolium ionic-liquid-based SPE on conductivity and current fluctuations. The experimental study was carried out on samples consisting of [EMIM][TFSI] as ionic liquid, PVDF as a polymer matrix and NMP as a solvent. After the deposition, the particular sample was kept at an appropriate temperature for a specific time in order to achieve different crystalline forms of the polymer in the solvent, since the solvent evaporation rate controls crystallization. The ac/dc conductivities of SPEs were investigated across a range of temperatures using broadband dielectric spectroscopy in terms of electrical conductivity. In SPE samples of the higher solvent evaporation rate, the real parts of conductivity spectra exhibit a sharper transition during sample cooling and an increase of overall conductivity, which is implied by a growing fraction of the amorphous phase in the polymer matrix in which the ionic liquid is immobilized. The conductivity master curves illustrate that the changing of SPEs morphology is reflected in the low frequency regions governed by the electrode polarization effect. The dc conductivity of SPEs exhibits Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence and increases with the intensity of thermal treatment. Spectral densities of current fluctuations showed that flicker noise, thermal noise and shot noise seems to be major noise sources in all samples. The increase of electrolyte conductivity causes a decrease in bulk resistance and partially a decrease in charge transfer resistance, while also resulting in an increase in shot noise. However, the change of electrode material results in a more significant change of spectral density of current fluctuations than the modification of the preparation condition of the solid polymer electrolyte. Thus, the contact noise is considered to contribute to overall current fluctuations across the samples.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-12-05", "authors": ["PetrSedlak", "AdamGajdos", "RobertMacku", "JiriMajzner", "VladimirHolcman", "VlastaSedlakova", "PetrKubersky"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-78363-6\n10.1039/C2TA00126H\n10.1002/adfm.201909736\n10.1002/ijch.201800159\n10.1007/s11581-016-1924-6\n10.1049/iet-nde.2018.0001\n10.1039/C5NR04339E\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.116\n10.1002/chem.201804369\n10.3389/fmats.2019.00113\n10.1016/j.ssi.2012.04.015\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.02.024\n10.3389/fchem.2019.00286\n10.1007/s11581-011-0563-1\n10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00546-2\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2015.07.007\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.003\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.01.039\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.07.010\n10.1016/j.ssi.2003.02.004\n10.1039/C7SE00441A\n10.1007/s10800-007-9294-4\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.09.016\n10.1039/c3py00466j\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b07986\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b07986\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107516\n10.1007/s11581-013-0905-2\n10.1039/c3ce40576a\n10.1016/j.ssi.2013.09.048\n10.1039/C9CE01051C\n10.1063/1.1755429\n10.1016/j.chemphys.2014.10.021\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.12.006\n10.3390/app10175818\n10.3390/s20041038\n10.1080/15421406.2020.1723892\n10.1103/PhysRevE.77.051202\n10.1038/s41598-017-07982-3\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.184301\n10.1021/ar2001809\n10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00554\n10.1039/C6CP08592J\n10.1016/j.fluid.2006.01.022\n10.1021/jp953538d\n10.1038/s41598-017-07982-3\n10.1021/je034261a\n10.1021/jp044626d\n10.3389/fchem.2019.00126\n10.1016/j.polymer.2019.03.032\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106801\n10.1149/1945-7111/ab7c3a\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.08.002\n10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.013\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b01421\n10.1177/1045389X13510217\n10.1016/S0026-2714(00)00091-3\n10.1038/ncomms13703"}

Two configurations were investigated by a modeling approach, Ni/Ni/Ni/PMN-PT with Cu as spacer and Terfenol-D/CoFeB/Ni/PMN-PT. Magnetic multilayers at their resonance exhibit multiple absorption peaks from acoustic and optical modes of spin interaction between adjacent magnetic layers. A piezoelectric substrate transfers electric field induced strain to adjacent magnetic layer and thus shifts resonance frequencies of the multiferroic structure by tuning magnetic effective fields through magnetoelastic coupling. It has been demonstrated computationally that the resonance frequencies for the simulated structures could be up to 76\u00a0GHz under zero magnetic bias field. A larger tunability (>\u2009100%) is achieved with applied electric field to the PMN-PT [011] substrate.

{"title": "Forming and loading giant unilamellar vesicles with acoustic jetting.", "abstract": "Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are a useful platform for reconstituting and studying membrane-bound biological systems, offering reduced complexity compared to living cells. Several techniques exist to form GUVs and populate them with biomolecules of interest. However, a persistent challenge is the ability to efficiently and reliably load solutions of biological macromolecules, organelle-like membranes, and/or micrometer-scale particles with controlled stoichiometry in the encapsulated volume of GUVs. Here, we demonstrate the use of acoustic streaming from high-intensity focused ultrasound to make and load GUVs from bulk solutions, without the need for nozzles that can become clogged or otherwise alter the solution composition. In this method, a compact acoustic lens is focused on a planar lipid bilayer formed between two aqueous solutions. The actuation of a planar piezoelectric material coupled to the lens accelerates a small volume of liquid, deforming the bilayer and forming a GUV containing the solution on the transducer side of the bilayer. As demonstrated here, acoustic jetting offers an alternative method for the generation of GUVs for biological and biophysical studies.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2020-12-04", "authors": ["MaximArmstrong", "Michael DVahey", "Thomas PHunt", "Daniel AFletcher"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0021742\n10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74726-2\n10.1038/ncb2561\n10.1038/nphys3678\n10.1039/dc9868100303\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2008.03.008\n10.1021/la403565f\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.08.018\n10.1002/cbdv.201200274\n10.1021/la8028403\n10.1038/s41598-018-27456-4\n10.1007/s00249-016-1155-9\n10.1021/la026100v\n10.3390/mi11030285\n10.1021/la801833a\n10.1063/1.3665221\n10.1002/smll.201301904\n10.1021/jf020366q\n10.1002/jcp.1040730108\n10.1073/pnas.75.9.4194\n10.1021/ac0003246\n10.1016/0005-2736(79)90085-3\n10.1073/pnas.0710875105\n10.1016/S0006-3495(78)85453-8\n10.1016/S0006-3495(76)85703-7\n10.1016/0022-460X(78)90388-7\n10.1121/1.411904\n10.1007/BF00190388"}

{"title": "Assessment of the Piezoelectric Response of an Epoxy Resin/SbSINanowires Composite Filling FDM Printed Grid.", "abstract": "This paper shows a piezoelectric response from an innovative sensor obtained by casting epoxy-SbSI (antimony sulfoiodide) nanowires nanocomposite to a grid structure printed using a fuse deposition modeling (FDM) method. The grid is shown to be a support structure for the nanocomposite. The applied design approach prospectively enables the formation of sensors with a wide spectrum of shapes and a wide applicability. The voltage signal obtained as a result of the piezoelectric effect reached 1.5V and 0.5V under a maximum static stress of 8.5 MPa and under a maximum dynamic stress of 22.3 kPa, respectively. These values are sufficient for potential application in sensor systems. The effect of a systematic increase in the voltage signal with subsequent cycles was also observed, which similarly allows the use of these sensors in monitoring systems for structures exposed to unfavorable cyclical loads. The obtained results also show that the piezoelectric signal improves with increase in strain rate.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-12-04", "authors": ["MateuszKozio\u0142", "PiotrSzperlich", "Bart\u0142omiejToro\u0144", "PiotrOlesik", "MarcinJesionek"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13225281\n10.1364/AO.48.001436\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00163.x\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2029109\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.006\n10.3390/s18051521\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/311\n10.1007/s11029-017-9651-2\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.05.038\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.10.064\n10.1016/S0263-8223(98)00017-8\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.08.105\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.02.007\n10.3390/ma13122696\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.020\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.06.011\n10.5194/jsss-7-169-2018\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2007.09.003\n10.1080/00150198608008198\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2013.11.012\n10.1016/j.rinp.2018.02.043\n10.1002/app.20901\n10.1063/1.4960212\n10.3390/s141222199\n10.1007/s10570-017-1597-y"}
{"title": "Polymerization Reactions and Modifications of Polymers by Ionizing Radiation.", "abstract": "Ionizing radiation has become the most effective way to modify natural and synthetic polymers through crosslinking, degradation, and graft polymerization. This review will include an in-depth analysis of radiation chemistry mechanisms and the kinetics of the radiation-induced C-centered free radical, anion, and cation polymerization, and grafting. It also presents sections on radiation modifications of synthetic and natural polymers. For decades, low linear energy transfer (LLET) ionizing radiation, such as gamma rays, X-rays, and up to 10 MeV electron beams, has been the primary tool to produce many products through polymerization reactions. Photons and electrons interaction with polymers display various mechanisms. While the interactions of gamma ray and X-ray photons are mainly through the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair-production, the interactions of the high-energy electrons take place through coulombic interactions. Despite the type of radiation used on materials, photons or high energy electrons, in both cases ions and electrons are produced. The interactions between electrons and monomers takes place within less than a nanosecond. Depending on the dose rate (dose is defined as the absorbed radiation energy per unit mass), the kinetic chain length of the propagation can be controlled, hence allowing for some control over the degree of polymerization. When polymers are submitted to high-energy radiation in the bulk, contrasting behaviors are observed with a dominant effect of cross-linking or chain scission, depending on the chemical nature and physical characteristics of the material. Polymers in solution are subject to indirect effects resulting from the radiolysis of the medium. Likewise, for radiation-induced polymerization, depending on the dose rate, the free radicals generated on polymer chains can undergo various reactions, such as inter/intramolecular combination or inter/intramolecular disproportionation, b-scission. These reactions lead to structural or functional polymer modifications. In the presence of oxygen, playing on irradiation dose-rates, one can favor crosslinking reactions or promotes degradations through oxidations. The competition between the crosslinking reactions of C-centered free radicals and their reactions with oxygen is described through fundamental mechanism formalisms. The fundamentals of polymerization reactions are herein presented to meet industrial needs for various polymer materials produced or degraded by irradiation. Notably, the medical and industrial applications of polymers are endless and thus it is vital to investigate the effects of sterilization dose and dose rate on various polymers and copolymers with different molecular structures and morphologies. The presence or absence of various functional groups, degree of crystallinity, irradiation temperature, etc. all greatly affect the radiation chemistry of the irradiated polymers. Over the past decade, grafting new chemical functionalities on solid polymers by radiation-induced polymerization (also called RIG for Radiation-Induced Grafting) has been widely exploited to develop innovative materials in coherence with actual societal expectations. These novel materials respond not only to health emergencies but also to carbon-free energy needs (e.g., hydrogen fuel cells, piezoelectricity, etc.) and environmental concerns with the development of numerous specific adsorbents of chemical hazards and pollutants. The modification of polymers through RIG is durable as it covalently bonds the functional monomers. As radiation penetration depths can be varied, this technique can be used to modify polymer surface or bulk. The many parameters influencing RIG that control the yield of the grafting process are discussed in this review. These include monomer reactivity, irradiation dose, solvent, presence of inhibitor of homopolymerization, grafting temperature, etc. Today, the general knowledge of RIG can be applied to any solid polymer and may predict, to some extent, the grafting location. A special focus is on how ionizing radiation sources (ion and electron beams, UVs) may be chosen or mixed to combine both solid polymer nanostructuration and RIG. LLET ionizing radiation has also been extensively used to synthesize hydrogel and nanogel for drug delivery systems and other advanced applications. In particular, nanogels can either be produced by radiation-induced polymerization and simultaneous crosslinking of hydrophilic monomers in \"nanocompartments\", i.e., within the aqueous phase of inverse micelles, or by intramolecular crosslinking of suitable water-soluble polymers. The radiolytically produced oxidizing species from water, \u2022OH radicals, can easily abstract H-atoms from the backbone of the dissolved polymers (or can add to the unsaturated bonds) leading to the formation of C-centered radicals. These C-centered free radicals can undergo two main competitive reactions; intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinking. When produced by electron beam irradiation, higher temperatures, dose rates within the pulse, and pulse repetition rates favour intramolecular crosslinking over intermolecular crosslinking, thus enabling a better control of particle size and size distribution. For other water-soluble biopolymers such as polysaccharides, proteins, DNA and RNA, the abstraction of H atoms or the addition to the unsaturation by \u2022OH can lead to the direct scission of the backbone, double, or single strand breaks of these polymers.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2020-12-04", "authors": ["AiyshaAshfaq", "Marie-ClaudeClochard", "XavierCoqueret", "CleliaDispenza",

{"title": "Impacts of Sulfuric Acid on the Stability and Separation Performance of Polymeric PVDF-Based Membranes at Mild and High Concentrations: An Experimental Study.", "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of an aqueous acidic solution at typical concentrations on polymeric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based membranes. Flat-sheet PVDF-based membranes were completely embedded in sulfuric acid at varying concentrations. The effect of the acid concentration after a prolonged exposure time on the chemical, mechanical and physical properties of the membrane were checked via FE-SEM, EDX (Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer), FTIR, XRD, tensile strength, zeta potential, contact angle, porosity, pure water flux measurement and visual observation. The result reveals prompt initiation of reaction between the PVDF membrane and sulfuric acid, even at a mild concentration. As the exposure time extends with increasing concentration, the change in chemical and mechanical properties become more pronounced, especially in the morphology, although this was not really noticeable in either the crystalline phase or the functional group analyses.

The performance of the focusing mechanism is related to the image quality of the remote sensor. It was optimized for a novel focusing mechanism comprised of a flexural hinge lever-type amplifier and several piezoelectric ceramics to improve the performance on high loads and large stroke in this research. It has advantages of a lightweight, simple structure and high reliability compared with the traditional focusing mechanism. The input displacement from the piezoelectric actuators was amplified by a two-stage flexure hinge lever-type mechanism. Dimensional parameters of the flexural hinges were considered as design variables. Based on the optimization ideology, reasonable compliance and dimension parameters of the flexural hinges were analyzed for the focusing mechanism. Simulation and experiments of deformation were conducted to validate the correctness of design optimization. The results show that the focusing mechanism designed by the proposed method has the capabilities of an amplification ratio of 100 times and a loading carrying capacity of 2 kg. This work provides a novel strategy to design an excellent focusing mechanism with lightweight, high loads and large stroke.

{"title": "Phase Switching as the Origin of Large Piezoelectric Response in Organic-Inorganic Perovskites: A First-Principles Study.", "abstract": "Piezoelectrics are critical functional components of many practical applications such as sensors, ultrasonic transducers, actuators, medical imaging, and telecommunications. So far, the best performing piezoelectrics are ferroelectric ceramics, many of which are toxic, heavy, hard, and cost-ineffective. Recently, a groundbreaking discovery of extraordinarily large piezoelectric coefficients in the family of organic-inorganic perovskites gave a hope for a cheaper, environmentally friendly, inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible alternative. However, the origin of such a response in organic-inorganic ferroelectrics whose spontaneous polarization is an order of magnitude smaller than for inorganic counterparts remains unclear. In our study, we employ first-principles simulations to predict that the mechanism associated with large piezoelectric constants is of extrinsic origin and associated with switching between the stable phase and a previously overlooked energetically competitive metastable phase that can be stabilized by the external stress. The phase switching changes the polarization direction and therefore produces a large piezoelectric response similar to PbZr_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{3} near the morphotropic phase boundary. The existence of such metastable phases is likely to manifest as the dynamical molecular disorder above the Curie temperature and therefore could be intrinsic to the entire family of organic-inorganic ferroelectrics with such disorder.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2020-12-02", "authors": ["P SGhosh", "SergeyLisenkov", "InnaPonomareva"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.207601"}
{"title": "Vibration enhanced cell growth induced by surface acoustic waves as in vitro wound-healing model.", "abstract": "We report on in vitro wound-healing and cell-growth studies under the influence of radio-frequency (rf) cell stimuli. These stimuli are supplied either by piezoactive surface acoustic waves (SAWs) or by microelectrode-generated electric fields, both at frequencies around 100 MHz. Employing live-cell imaging, we studied the time- and power-dependent healing of artificial wounds on a piezoelectric chip for different cell lines. If the cell stimulation is mediated by piezomechanical SAWs, we observe a pronounced, significant maximum of the cell-growth rate at a specific SAW amplitude, resulting in an increase of the wound-healing speed of up to 135 \u00b1 85% as compared to an internal reference. In contrast, cells being stimulated only by electrical fields of the same magnitude as the ones exposed to SAWs exhibit no significant effect. In this study, we investigate this effect for different wavelengths, amplitude modulation of the applied electrical rf signal, and different wave modes. Furthermore, to obtain insight into the biological response to the stimulus, we also determined both the cell-proliferation rate and the cellular stress levels. While the proliferation rate is significantly increased for a wide power range, cell stress remains low and within the normal range. Our findings demonstrate that SAW-based vibrational cell stimulation bears the potential for an alternative method to conventional ultrasound treatment, overcoming some of its limitations.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2020-12-02", "authors": ["Manuel SBrugger", "KathrinBaumgartner", "Sophie C FMauritz", "Stefan CGerlach", "FlorianR\u00f6der", "ChristineSchlosser", "ReginaFluhrer", "AchimWixforth", "ChristophWesterhausen"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2005203117"}

This electrical energy can be supplied by piezoelectric vibrational energy harvesting (pVEH) devices. These devices can convert energy from ambient mechanical excitations into electrical energy. In order to develop, these devices require piezoelectric films fabricated with a simple and low-cost process.

{"title": "A Numerical Model for Experimental Designs of Vibration-Based Leak Detection and Monitoring of Water Pipes Using Piezoelectric Patches.", "abstract": "While the potential use of energy harvesters as structural health monitors show promise, numerical models related to the design, deployment and performance of such monitors often present significant challenges. One such challenge lies in the problem of leak detection in fluid-carrying pipes. Recent advances in experimental studies on energy harvesters for such monitoring has been promising but there is a paucity in existing literature in linking relevant fluid-structure interaction models around such applications. This paper addresses the abovementioned issue by developing a numerical model with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element (FE) tools and carries out extensive analyses to compare it with existing experiments under controlled laboratory conditions. Conventional Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films for leak detection and monitoring of water pipes were considered in this regard. The work provides guidelines on parameter selection and modeling for experimental design and repeatability of results for these types of experiments in future, around the demands of leak monitoring. The usefulness of such models is also demonstrated through the ability to estimate the optimum distribution frequency of these sensors that will enable the detection of the smallest leak of consequence under a known or established flow condition.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-12-02", "authors": ["FavourOkosun", "MertCelikin", "VikramPakrashi"], "doi": "10.3390/s20236708\n10.3390/s17092104\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.02.022\n10.3390/s19112548\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2011.11.001\n10.1016/j.jlp.2015.04.012\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2015.06.020\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.030\n10.3390/mi9010019\n10.1007/s40430-018-1445-5\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.007\n10.1140/epjst/e2019-800150-6\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2010.05.001\n10.1016/j.apm.2009.12.018\n10.1016/j.apm.2014.07.001\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.310.280\n10.1063/1.1763256\n10.1016/j.euromechflu.2012.03.015\n10.1016/S0142-727X(03)00061-4\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2007.06.002\n10.3390/proceedings2110590\n10.3390/sym11010065\n10.1016/j.camwa.2009.08.060\n10.1177/1468087416658604\n10.1007/s13344-011-0032-7\n10.29252/jafm.12.02.28612\n10.1504/PCFD.2013.050646\n10.1016/j.bjbas.2014.12.001\n10.1002/ese3.514\n10.1016/j.compchemeng.2007.08.011\n10.1680/wama.2007.160.2.109\n10.1115/1.4044287\n10.3390/s16040448\n10.1177/1475921719861801"}

{"title": "Anti-biofouling microfiltration membranes based on 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride grafted PVDF with improved bactericidal properties and vitro biocompatibility.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) porous membranes have been widely used as the filtration and separation industry. Herein, novel microfiltration membranes based on 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride ([VBIm][Cl]) grafted PVDF (PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl]) were prepared via the non-solvent induced phase separation method. The chemical composition and microstructure of PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Water contact angle measurements. The results showed that an increasing in [VBIm][Cl] grafting content leads to the increasing hydrophilicity and wetting capacity of the PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] porous membranes. The anti-biofouling properties of membranes were evaluated by measuring the water flux before and after Bovine serum albumin solution treatment. It was found that the modified membranes presented a good anti-biofouling property. The degree of irreversible flux loss caused by protein adsorption dramatically reduced from 42.1% to 2.9% compared with the pristine hydrophobic PVDF membranes. Meanwhile, these PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes also exhibited excellent bactericidal properties against both gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus saureus and gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, while PVDF membranes did not show any antibacterial activity. The vitro biocompatibility of the modified membranes was studied by hemolysis analysis, the platelet adhesion observation, thromboelastography assay and cytotoxicity assay. It was found that the incorporation of [VBIm][Cl] into PVDF membranes has less effect on the hemolysis and cytotoxicity of PVDF membranes. Furthermore, both hydrophilicity and charges of the membrane surface played important role in the adhesion and activation of platelet cells, which consequently affected the clotting process of whole blood. The membrane with appropriate [VBIm][Cl] grafting ratio (2.94\u00a0wt.%) exhibited good hemocompatibility with less blood coagulation effect. As an ultrafiltration membrane, PVDF-g-[VBIm][Cl] membranes have potential applications in the biomedical field due to the improved antibacterial property and biocompatibility.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

In this study, a distribution equation for the critical point for producing droplets defined in a dimensionless plane composed of Weber and Reynolds numbers was proposed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to calculate the critical point distribution of the droplets generated by various materials in the dimensionless plane. Simulation results showed that the proposed distribution equation could describe the varying laws of the critical points of different materials. Process parameters in the distribution equation were identified using a fitting method based on CFD simulation results. The formula for calculating the critical characteristic velocity and dimensionless coordinates of the generated droplets was proposed based on the identified process parameters. The critical characteristic velocity and dimensionless coordinates of water, ethanol, aniline, and glycol were calculated using the proposed method. The average relative error between the calculated results and those from CFD is less than 5%. The drive waveforms of PPH are designed using the critical characteristic velocity of four different materials. Their droplet generation processes were recorded through a droplet watch system. The experimental results indicate that the flight velocity of the droplets generated at the critical characteristic velocity is close to zero, which indicates that the method proposed in this study is accurate.", "journal": "3D printing and additive manufacturing", "date": "2020-12-01", "authors": ["JianjunWang", "JinHuang", "JieZhang"], "doi": "10.1089/3dp.2019.0111"}

However, information regarding its performance is scarce.\nThe purpose of this in\u00a0vitro study was to evaluate the reliability and repeatability of a newly introduced digital occlusal analysis device (Accura) and to compare it with an established occlusal analyzer (T-scan Novus).\nThe sensor films of both devices were positioned between titanium maxillary and mandibular models that were equilibrated and arbitrarily mounted on a semiadjustable articulator. Compressive force was applied to the upper arm of the articulator with a universal testing machine, increased gradually to 50 N, and then released automatically. The time and force measurements from the universal testing machine and the tested devices were recorded by operating software programs. Five articulating film sensors of each device were tested 3 times each by 2 examiners and were repeated on consecutive days, totaling 60 trials per device. Reliability was defined as an agreement between the loaded force and measured force. Repeatability was defined as an agreement between repeated measurements of the Accura and T-scan Novus. Intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for the statistical analysis (\u03b1=.05).\nThe calculated intraclass correlation coefficient of the Accura and the universal testing machine was 0.952. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the T-scan Novus and the universal testing machine was 0.963. Intraclass correlation coefficients that were calculated to compare the data acquired from different days were 0.938 for the Accura and 0.911 for the T-scan Novus.\nThe experimental results indicated that the reliability of both the Accura and T-scan Novus was excellent for measuring occlusal forces.

Increasing attention is being paid to the behaviors and mobilities of the various Sb species in the environment.

Here, we studied Sb behavior in sediment of a shallow lake in the plain rivers network in Taihu Basin that suffers continual Sb inputs from textile plants. The diffusive gradients in thin films techniques (DGT) made of zirconium oxide based binding resin gel (ZrO-Chelex), agarose diffusive gel and polyvinylidene fluoride filter were deployed in water and sediment to obtain a high-resolution record in situ. The results indicated that (1) pollutants released by textile plants caused relatively high Sb(\u2162), Sb(\u2164) and organoantimony concentrations in the eutrophic shallow lake, (2) Sb was seldomly mobile in the oxic layer where Sb(\u2162) was sorbed on Fe(\u2162) oxides and gradually formed Fe-Sb complexes in the sediment, but in the anoxic environment (oxidation-reduction potential: 366\u00a0-\u00a0-344 mv) Sb(V), Fe(\u2161) and P (V) were simultaneously released to resupply the porewater, (3) the release of Sb from solid phase is decided by the redox condition, and the rate of release is dependent on the labile Sb content of the sediment.

According to the mechanical boundary conditions, the electromechanical equivalent circuits and frequency equation of various piezoelectric composite vibration systems can be obtained, including the radially sandwiched spherical piezoelectric transducer. The correctness of the proposed theory is verified via comparison with the finite element method and the previous theoretical model. In addition, the 2nd-order effective mechanical coupling coefficient for the radially sandwiched spherical piezoelectric transducer is higher than that of 1st-order within a specific range of wall thickness, which can be designed as the high-frequency transducer.

Intraocular pressure (IOP) and CSFP are the driving components of translaminar pressure (TLP = IOP - CSFP), which acts across the lamina cribrosa (LC) thickness to create the translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG = TLP/LC thickness).\nWe developed an implantable wireless telemetry system based on a small piezoelectric sensor with low temporal drift. IOP, measured in the anterior chamber, and intracranial pressure (ICP), measured in the brain parenchyma (as a surrogate for CSFP) were measured at 200 Hz in three male rhesus macaques (nonhuman primates, NHPs) on a 10% duty cycle (15 seconds of every 150-second period). Three-dimensional LC thickness was autosegmented as the mean thickness of the visible hyperreflective band in 48 radial spectral-domain optical coherence tomography b-scans centered on the optic nerve head.\nResults indicated the rank order of IOP, ICP, TLP, and TLPG for waking, sleeping, and 24-hour periods averaged across all days. NHP 150110 had the highest IOP and ICP in all periods; however, it had the lowest TLPG in all periods due to its relatively thick LC. The other two NHPs showed similar shifts in the rank order of possible glaucoma risk factors.\nIOP is the only modifiable and readily measurable pressure-based risk factor for glaucoma. However, other potential risk factors such as ICP, TLP, and TLPG, as well as their rank-order patterns, differed compared to IOP across subjects, demonstrating that a comprehensive view of relevant risk factors is warranted.\nFuture studies should consider including CSFP, TLP, and TLPG in addition to IOP as potential risk factors when assessing eye-specific glaucoma susceptibility.", "journal": "Translational vision science & technology", "date": "2020-11-27", "authors": ["Jessica VJasien", "Massimo AFazio", "Brian CSamuels", "James MJohnston", "J CrawfordDowns"], "doi": "10.1167/tvst.9.12.18"}

As it requires contact coupling and calibration of the instruments is suboptimal, this method has been only rarely used in clinical routine work. As a result of close collaboration between physicists, information scientists and ophthalmologists, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of the eye has been developed in recent years and a prototype can now be used in patients. The present study evaluates possible clinical uses of this method.\nThe essential innovations in CLSM are (1) a newly designed coupling element with superficial adaptation to corneal curvature and (2) the use of a dual computerised piezo drive for rapid and precise focusing. In post-processing and after elastic imaging registration of the individual images parallel to the surface, it is also possible to produce sagittal sections resembling a split lamp and with resolution in the micrometer range. The concept was tested on enucleated pig bulbi and tested on normal volunteers and selected patients with diseases of the cornea.\nSimultaneous imaging in planes parallel to the surface and in sagittal planes provided additional information that can help us to understand the processes of wound healing in all substructures of the cornea and the role of immune competent cells. Possible clinical uses were demonstrated in a volunteer with healthy eyes and several groups of patients (keratoconus after CXL, recurrent keratitis, status after PRK). These show that this new approach can be used in morphological studies at cellular level in any desired and appropriate test plane.\nIt could be shown that this new concept of CLSM can be used clinically. It can provide valuable and novel information to both preclinical researchers and to ophthalmologists interested in corneal disease, e.g. density of Langerhans cells and epithelial stratification in ocular surface diseases.\nDie konfokale In-vivo-Mikroskopie hat sich in der Augenheilkunde als Forschungsmethode etabliert.

Im Rahmen dieser Studie wurden die M\u00f6glichkeiten der Methode im klinischen Einsatz evaluiert.\nWesentliche Neuerungen der CLSM stellen (1) ein neugestaltetes Koppelelement mit einer der Hornhautkr\u00fcmmung angepassten Oberfl\u00e4che und (2) der Einsatz eines dualen computergest\u00fctzen Piezoantriebs f\u00fcr eine schnelle pr\u00e4zise Fokusf\u00fchrung dar. Im Postprocessing und nach einer elastischen Bildregistrierung der oberfl\u00e4chenparallelen Einzelbilder gelingt es auch, sagittale, spaltlampen\u00e4hnliche Schnitte mit einer Aufl\u00f6sung im Mikrometerbereich zu erzeugen.

The development of wearable sensors that can continuously monitor the environment for viruses may become an important research area. Here, the state of the art of research on biosensor materials for virus detection is reviewed. A general description of the principles for virus detection is included, along with a critique of the experimental work dedicated to various virus sensors, and a summary of their detection limitations. The piezoelectric sensors used for the detection of human papilloma, vaccinia, dengue, Ebola, influenza A, human immunodeficiency, and hepatitis B viruses are examined in the first section; then the second part deals with magnetostrictive sensors for the detection of bacterial spores, proteins, and classical swine fever. In addition, progress related to early detection of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is discussed in the final section, where remaining challenges in the field are also identified. It is believed that this review will guide material researchers in their future work of developing smart biosensors, which can further improve detection sensitivity in monitoring currently known and future virus threats.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2020-11-25", "authors": ["FumioNarita", "ZhenjinWang", "HirokiKurita", "ZhenLi", "YuShi", "YuJia", "ConstantinosSoutis"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202005448"}

Xerostomia was assessed using a 4-question xerostomia questionnaire score and a test for unstimulated salivary flow rates. Evaluations were performed before the treatment and 3\u00a0months after the treatment using a thermoformed splint with a magnet device.\nThere was a significant reduction in subjective symptoms after using a thermoformed splint with a magnet device for 3\u00a0months. For all 4 scored items, there was a statistically significant difference (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in median VAS scores before and 3\u00a0months after treatment. There was also a statistically significant difference in USFR before (0,15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00,04\u00a0ml/min) and after treatment (0,24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00,03\u00a0mL/min).\nOur findings indicate that the use of this device alleviated oral dryness and stimulated the function of the submandibular salivary gland.

{"title": "Low-intensity Blast Wave Model for Preclinical Assessment of Closed-head Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Rodents.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a large-scale public health problem. Mild TBI is the most prevalent form of neurotrauma and accounts for a large number of medical visits in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments available for TBI. The increased incidence of military-related, blast-induced TBI further accentuates the urgent need for effective TBI treatments. Therefore, new preclinical TBI animal models that recapitulate aspects of human blast-related TBI will greatly advance the research efforts into the neurobiological and pathophysiological processes underlying mild to moderate TBI as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TBI. Here we present a reliable, reproducible model for the investigation of the molecular, cellular, and behavioral effects of mild to moderate blast-induced TBI. We describe a step-by-step protocol for closed-head, blast-induced mild TBI in rodents using a bench-top setup consisting of a gas-driven shock tube equipped with piezoelectric pressure sensors to ensure consistent test conditions. The benefits of the setup that we have established are its relative low-cost, ease of installation, ease of use and high-throughput capacity. Further advantages of this non-invasive TBI model include the scalability of the blast peak overpressure and the generation of controlled reproducible outcomes. The reproducibility and relevance of this TBI model has been evaluated in a number of downstream applications, including neurobiological, neuropathological, neurophysiological and behavioral analyses, supporting the use of this model for the characterization of processes underlying the etiology of mild to moderate TBI.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-11-24", "authors": ["Aric FLogsdon", "Brandon PLucke-Wold", "Ryan CTurner", "Sean MCollins", "Evan LReeder", "Jason DHuber", "Charles LRosen", "Matthew JRobson", "FlorianPlattner"], "doi": "10.3791/61244"}

This study was conducted to compare patient complaint levels between magnetostrictive (M-USSC) and piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers (P-USSC) during supragingival scaling.\nThis study enrolled 82 subjects who received supportive periodontal therapy for at least 2\u00a0years. At each recall visit, probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and O'Leary plaque control record (O'PCR) were recorded. Then, supragingival scaling was performed using P-USSC (Varios or Petit Piezo) at the first visit and M-USSC (Cavitron) at the second visit. After each treatment, a questionnaire survey was performed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale for six items, which included the typical complaints occurring during ultrasonic scaling.\nThe scores for all the six items related to patient complaints were greater for P-USSC than for M-USSC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Patient complaints such as discomfort, pain, sound, vibration, hyperesthesia and length of treatment time were ameliorated in 74%, 65%, 80%, 67%, 57% and 53% of subjects using M-USSC, respectively.

{"title": "A Piezoelectric Tactile Sensor for Tissue Stiffness Detection with Arbitrary Contact Angle.", "abstract": "In this paper, a piezoelectric tactile sensor for detecting tissue stiffness in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) is proposed. It can detect the stiffness not only when the probe is normal to the tissue surface, but also when there is a contact angle between the probe and normal direction. It solves the problem that existing sensors can only detect in the normal direction to ensure accuracy when the degree of freedom (DOF) of surgical instruments is limited. The proposed senor can distinguish samples with different stiffness and recognize lump from normal tissue effectively when the contact angle varies within [0\u00b0, 45\u00b0]. These are achieved by establishing a new detection model and sensor optimization. It deduces the influence of contact angle on stiffness detection by sensor parameters design and optimization. The detection performance of the sensor is confirmed by simulation and experiment. Five samples with different stiffness (including lump and normal samples with close stiffness) are used. Through blind recognition test in simulation, the recognition rate is 100% when the contact angle is randomly selected within 30\u00b0, 94.1% within 45\u00b0, which is 38.7% higher than the unoptimized sensor. Through blind classification test and automatic k-means clustering in experiment, the correct rate is 92% when the contact angle is randomly selected within 45\u00b0.

{"title": "Determination of Impact Damage in CFRP via PVDF Signal Analysis with Support Vector Machine.", "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have high specific stiffness and strength, but they are vulnerable to transverse loading, especially low-velocity impact loadings. The impact damage may cause serious strength reduction in CFRP structure, but the damage in a CFRP is mainly internal and microscopic, that it is barely visible. Therefore, this study proposes a method of determining impact damage in CFRP via poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) sensor, which is convenient and has high mechanical and electrical performance. In total, 114 drop impact tests were performed to investigate on impact responses and PVDF signals due to impacts. The test results were analyzed to determine the damage of specimens and signal features, which are relevant to failure mechanisms were extracted from PVDF signals by means of discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

{"title": "Electric Auxetic Effect in Piezoelectrics.", "abstract": "Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio that they expand laterally in the directions perpendicular to the applied stretching stress and vice versa. Piezoelectrics will change their dimensions when exposed to an external electric field. Here we introduce the concept of the \"electric auxetic effect\": electric auxetic materials will contract or expand in all dimensions in response to an electric field. Such unusual piezoelectric response driven by an electric field is a close analogy to the auxetic effect driven by a stress field. A key feature of electric auxetic materials is that their longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are of the same sign. We demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the Pca2_{1} orthorhombic phase of ferroelectric HfO_{2} exhibits both the negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect and the electric auxetic effect. The unusual negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect arises unexpectedly from the domination of the negative internal-strain contribution over the positive clamped-ion contribution, a character often found in van der Waals solids. We confirm a few more electric auxetic materials with finite electric field calculations by screening through a first-principles-based database of piezoelectrics.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2020-11-21", "authors": ["JianLiu", "ShiLiu", "Jia-YueYang", "LinhuaLiu"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.197601"}

The technique takes not more than 10\u00a0min for staining and is comparable in sensitivity to the most commonly used Coomassie R-250 staining method when applied to different concentrations of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and various amounts of E. coli extracts. The protein (BSA) band (~0.5\u00a0\u03bcg) and E. coli extract comprising ~25\u00a0\u03bcg total protein can be visualized on polyacrylamide gels. Compared to both Coomassie and Ponceau S staining, the current method displayed more intense bands when proteins are transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Although the walnut-dye (WD) method does not require a time-consuming destaining step, excess background stain can simply be removed by washing in water. Extract from old dried black husks and extract from fresh green husks kept for a year was also effective. Using LC-MS, Myricetin and/or Kaempferol were found to be active compounds responsible for staining proteins. Compared to traditional Coomassie method, the inclusion of expensive and toxic solvents (methanol and acetic acid) is completely avoided resulting in positive health, environmental and economic benefits.

{"title": "A High-Voltage and Low-Noise Power Amplifier for Driving Piezoelectric Stack Actuators.", "abstract": "In this paper, based on the principles of general operational amplifiers, a high-voltage operational amplifier is developed. Considering the influences of piezoelectric stack actuators on the circuit, a novel structure using the high-voltage operational amplifier as a noninverting amplifier is proposed. Because of the simple circuit principles and the voltage feedback control structure, the proposed power amplifier has the advantages of low noise and small size, and it can be realized by discrete electric elements easily. In the application of precision positioning, a power amplifier using the proposed circuit principles for driving piezoelectric stack actuators is designed, simulated, and tested. The simulated results show that the proposed power amplifier could conform to the theory of the circuit. The experimental results show that the designed power amplifier conforms to the simulation, the bandwidth of the power amplifier is about 57 kHz, and the ripple of the power amplifier is less than 2 mV. Furthermore, the output of the proposed power amplifier maintains the same type of wave within in a large range of frequency, while the input is the sinusoidal or square wave, and the resolution of the mechanism which the power amplifier is applied in is about 4.5 nm. By selecting the critical electronic elements and using feedback control, the proposed circuit structure is able to realize a low-cost and high-performance power amplifier to drive piezoelectric stack actuators flexibly, which is the novel work of the paper.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-11-19", "authors": ["LisongXu", "HongwenLi", "PengzhiLi", "ChuanGe"], "doi": "10.3390/s20226528\n10.1002/cta.273\n10.1002/cta.399\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106964\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.07.013\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106881\n10.1016/j.optcom.2019.125209\n10.1109/TIE.2018.2868321\n10.1109/TMECH.2015.2483739\n10.1109/TIE.2017.2698398\n10.1177/1045389X09345559\n10.1109/TCSI.2009.2018938\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.01.011\n10.1002/cta.1846\n10.1002/cta.549\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-007X(199907/08)27:4<421::AID-CTA74>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2008.06.009\n10.1109/TIE.2008.926709\n10.1109/TPEL.2003.818825\n10.1109/41.557506\n10.1109/TMECH.2017.2757931\n10.1002/cta.2227\n10.1063/1.3234261\n10.1109/TCSI.2008.923283"}
{"title": "Sensitivity Analysis of Acoustic Emission Detection Using Fiber Bragg Gratings with Different Optical Fiber Diameters.", "abstract": "Acoustic Emission (AE) detection and, in particular, ultrasound detection are excellent tools for structural health monitoring or medical diagnosis. Despite the technological maturity of the well-received piezoelectric transducer, optical fiber AE detection sensors are attracting increasing attention due to their small size, and electromagnetic and chemical immunity as well as the broad frequency response of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors in these fibers. Due to the merits of their small size, FBGs were inscribed in optical fibers with diameters of 50 and 80 \u03bcm in this work. The manufactured FBGs were used for the detection of reproducible acoustic waves using the edge filter detection method. The acquired acoustic signals were compared to the ones captured by a standard 125 \u03bcm-diameter optical fiber FBG. Result analysis was performed by utilizing fast Fourier and wavelet decompositions. Both analyses reveal a higher sensitivity and dynamic range for the 50 \u03bcm-diameter optical fiber, despite it being more prone to noise than the other two, due to non-standard splicing methods and mode field mismatch losses. Consequently, the use of smaller-diameter optical fibers for AE detection is favorable for both the sensor sensitivity as well as physical footprint.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-11-19", "authors": ["GeorgiosViolakis", "TriLe-Quang", "Sergey AShevchik", "KilianWasmer"], "doi": "10.3390/s20226511\n10.1177/1475921714560074\n10.1126/science.280.5360.82\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/1/314\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.926894\n10.1364/AO.51.004709\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.927240\n10.1109/LPT.2019.2919483\n10.1364/AO.16.001761\n10.1364/AO.17.000330\n10.1364/OE.16.001945\n10.1364/OE.20.028353\n10.1364/OE.21.015514\n10.1109/JLT.2017.2771436\n10.1109/JLT.2013.2254110\n10.1109/JLT.2018.2885957\n10.1155/2014/274071\n10.1364/OL.37.004768\n10.1109/LPT.2004.826033\n10.1109/50.730362\n10.3390/fib6010013\n10.1364/AO.37.008120\n10.1364/OE.11.001918\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.11.003\n10.1364/OL.33.001004\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.926878\n10.1121/1.3466847\n10.1121/1.2773928\n10.1109/58.710593\n10.1109/50.4020\n10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00534.x"}

{"title": "Design and Preparation of Molecularly Imprinted Membranes for Selective Separation of Acteoside.", "abstract": "Acteoside (ACT) belongs to a type of phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), and it is worthy of obtaining high-purity due to its significant medicinal functions. In this study, a novel class of MIMs was designed and synthesized with PVDF membranes as the base membrane for high selective separation and enrichment of ACT. The effects of the different functional monomers, the amounts of functional monomers, crosslinking agents, and initiators on the separation properties of MIMs were investigated. Furthermore, adsorption ability, permeation capacity, and reusability of MIMs were discussed for ACT. It indicated that MIM7 was the optimal performance of MIMs. The adsorption ability of MIM7 for ACT was 62.83 mg/g, and the selectivity factor (\u03b1) of MIM7 was up to 2.74 and its permeability factor (\u03b2) was greater than 2.66. Moreover, the adsorption amount of MIM7 was still more than 88.57% of the initial value after five cycles. As an ACT imprinted layer of MIMs only had recognition sites for ACT molecules, which recombined with the recognition sites in the membrane permeation experiment, ACT molecules penetration was hindered.

{"title": "Piezoelectric sensor based on graphene-doped PVDF nanofibers for sign language translation.", "abstract": "The tracking of body motion, such as bending or twisting, plays an important role in modern sign language translation. Here, a subtle flexible self-powered piezoelectric sensor (PES) made of graphene (GR)-doped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers is reported. The PES exhibits a high sensitivity to pressing and bending, and there is a stable correlation between bending angle and piezoelectric voltage. The sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the doping concentration of GR. Also, when the PES contacts a source of heat, a pyroelectric signal can be acquired.

{"title": "Bio-structural monitoring of bone mineral alterations through electromechanical impedance measurements of a Piezo-device joined to a tooth.", "abstract": "Bone presents different systemic functionalities as calcium phosphate reservoir, organ protection, among others. For that reason, the bone health conditions are essential to keep in equilibrium the metabolism of several body systems. Different technologies exist to diagnose bone conditions with invasive methods based on ionizing radiation. Therefore, there is a challenge to develop new ways to evaluate bone alterations in a noninvasive form. This study shows the assessment of a piezo-actuated device acting on a human tooth for the bio-monitoring of bone alterations. The bone diagnosis is performed by applying the electromechanical impedance technique (EMI), commonly used in structural health monitoring. For the experimental tests, five bone samples were prepared, and one was chosen as the monitoring. All samples were put in a decalcifying substance (TBD1 acid-base) at different times to emulate localized bone mineral alterations. Bone reductions were computed by using X-ray micro-computed tomography analyzing the morphometry. Electrical resistance measurements (piezo-device) were taken for the monitoring specimen meanwhile it was partially decalcified during 8520\u00a0seconds. In the frequency spectrum, several observation windows showed that the bone alterations gradually changed the electrical resistance signals which were quantified statistically. Results evidenced that the bone density changes are correlated with the electrical resistance\u00a0measurements; these changes presented an exponential behavior as much as in the calculated index, and bone mineral reduction. The results demonstrated that bone alterations exhibit linear dependence with the computed\u00a0statistical indexes. This result confirms that it is possible to observe the bone changes from the teeth as a future application.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering letters", "date": "2020-11-17", "authors": ["Hector ATinoco", "Carlos ICardona", "Maribel L FMar\u00edn-Berrio", "JulianaGarc\u00eda-Grisales", "Juan PGomez", "Samuel IRoldan", "Fabio MPe\u00f1a", "AdamBrinek", "DominikaKalasov\u00e1", "JozefKaiser", "TomasZikmund"], "doi": "10.1007/s13534-020-00170-9"}

{"title": "Shockwave application enhances the effect of dentin desensitizer.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a new device that can improve the effect of desensitizer using shockwaves and to verify its efficacy.\nA micro-shockwave generator was developed using a piezoelectric actuator (PIA-1000, piezosystem jena GmbH, Jena, Germany), an Arduino Uno microcontroller (Arduino, Torino, Italy), and a high voltage pulser (HVP-1000, piezosystem jena GmbH) at 700\u202fV (400 A) and 100\u202f\u03bcs. The occlusal surfaces of 20 extracted human upper and lower third molars without caries or restoration were reduced to expose the occlusal dentin, and the prepared occlusal surfaces were acid-etched with 32% phosphoric acid to remove the smear layer. The tooth specimens were connected to a fluid flow measurement instrument (nanoFlow, IB SYSTEMS, Seoul, Korea), permeability through dentin via dentinal fluid flow (DFF) was measured for 300\u202fs, and the average DFF rate (Baseline DFF rate) was calculated. A desensitizer (SuperSeal, Phoenix Dental, Fenton, MI, USA) was applied to the acid-etched occlusal dentin surface of 10 randomly selected tooth specimens, left for 10\u202fs, and rubbed with a microbrush for 30\u202fs (Group 1). For the remaining teeth, the desensitizer was applied, and a shockwave (100\u202f\u03bcm stroke, 10,000\u202fG) was applied for 10\u202fs (2 shots/s) and rubbed with a microbrush for 30\u202fs (Group 2). After desensitizer application, subsequent DFF was measured for 600\u202fs, and the average DFF rate was calculated (post-application DFF rate). DFF was continuously measured in real-time at 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u2103 under a hydrostatic pressure of 25\u202fcm. The percentage reduction in DFF rate after desensitizer application (with or without shockwave) was calculated with respect to baseline DFF rate. Data were analyzed with independent t-test (\u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05).\nFor all tooth specimens, DFF rate decreased after desensitizer application irrespective of the presence of shockwaves. The percentage reduction in DFF rate of SuperSeal with shockwave (Group 2) was 42.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f19.0%, which was significantly higher than the 26.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.6% of the SuperSeal only group (Group 1) (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).\nMeasurement of DFF change in real-time shows that shockwaves can help reduce dentin permeability beyond that SuperSeal dentin desensitizer produced alone.", "journal": "Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials", "date": "2020-11-17", "authors": ["Chang-HaLee", "Seol-AhJo", "KyongokKang", "JanDhont", "JackFerracane", "In-BogLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.dental.2020.10.027"}

{"title": "Physicochemical parameters that underlie inkjet printing for medical applications.", "abstract": "One of the most common types of 3D printing technologies is inkjet printing due to its numerous advantages, including low cost, programmability, high resolution, throughput, and speed. Inkjet printers are also capable of fabricating artificial tissues with physiological characteristics similar to those of living tissues. These artificial tissues are used for disease modeling, drug discovery, drug screening, and replacements for diseased or damaged tissues. This paper reviews recent advancements in one of the most common 3D printing technologies, inkjet dispensing. We briefly consider common printing techniques, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (STL), and inkjet printing. We briefly discuss various steps in inkjet printing, including droplet generation, droplet ejection, interaction of droplets on substrates, drying, and solidification. We also discuss various parameters that affect the printing process, including ink properties (e.g., viscosity and surface tension), physical parameters (e.g., internal diameter of printheads), and actuation mechanisms (e.g., piezoelectric actuation and thermal actuation). Through better understanding of common 3D printing technologies and the parameters that influence the printing processes, new types of artificial tissues, disease models, and structures for drug discovery and drug screening may be prepared.

The analytical performances, the advantages and drawbacks of each type of biosensor are highlighted, discussed, and compared to traditional methods.

We leveraged dual-gate piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) fabricated on flexible substrates to record normal and shear forces with high sensitivity over a broad range of forces. An individual ZnO TFT can intrinsically sense, amplify, and multiplex force signals, allowing ease of scalability for multiplexing from hundreds of elements with 100-\u03bcm spatial and sub-10-ms temporal resolutions. Notably, exclusive feedback from the tactile sensor array enabled rapid adjustment of grip force to slip, enabling the direct autonomous robotic tactile perception with a single modality. For biomedical and implantable device applications, pulse sensing and underwater flow detection were demonstrated. This robust technology, with its reproducible and reliable performance, can be immediately translated for use in industrial and surgical robotics, neuroprosthetics, implantables, and beyond.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2020-11-15", "authors": ["HongseokOh", "Gyu-ChulYi", "MichaelYip", "Shadi ADayeh"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.abd7795"}

In this study, novel poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-alpha-zirconium phosphate (PVDF-\u03b1-ZrP) mixed matrix membranes (MMM) were prepared via the phase inversion method. Membranes with different \u03b1-ZrP nanoparticles (NPs) loadings (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.00\u00a0wt%) were fabricated. The impacts of \u03b1-ZrP NP loading on the membrane's morphology, functionality, surface charge, and hydrophilicity were evaluated. Fourier-transform infrared and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed to verify the presence of \u03b1-ZrP NPs in the fabricated membranes. The PVDF membranes became more hydrophilic after incorporating the \u03b1-ZrP NPs. The thermal and mechanical stability and porosity of the PVDF-\u03b1-ZrP MMM were higher than those of the pristine PVDF membrane. The increased hydrophilicity, pore size and porosity and reduced surface roughness of the PVDF-\u03b1-ZrP membrane led to significant flux increase and reduced fouling propensity.

{"title": "Design and Analysis of a Novel Piezoceramic Stack-based Smart Aggregate.", "abstract": "A novel piezoceramic stack-based smart aggregate (PiSSA) with piezoceramic wafers in series or parallel connection is developed to increase the efficiency and output performance over the conventional smart aggregate with only one piezoelectric patch. Due to the improvement, PiSSA is suitable for situations where the stress waves easily attenuate. In PiSSA, the piezoelectric wafers are electrically connected in series or parallel, and three types of piezoelectric wafers with different electrode patterns are designed for easy connection. Based on the theory of piezo-elasticity, a simplified one-dimensional model is derived to study the electromechanical, transmitting and sensing performance of PiSSAs with the wafers in series and parallel connection, and the model was verified by experiments. The theoretical results reveal that the first resonance frequency of PiSSAs in series and parallel decreases as the number or thickness of the PZT wafers increases, and the first electromechanical coupling factor increases firstly and then decrease gradually as the number or thickness increases. The results also show that both the first resonance frequency and the first electromechanical coupling factor of PiSSA in series and parallel change no more than 0.87% as the Young's modulus of the epoxy increases from 0.5 to 1.5 times 3.2 GPa, which is helpful for the fabrication of PiSSAs. In addition, the displacement output of PiSSAs in parallel is about 2.18-22.49 times that in series at 1-50 kHz, while the voltage output of PiSSAs in parallel is much less than that in parallel, which indicates that PiSSA in parallel is much more suitable for working as an actuator to excite stress waves and PiSSA in series is suitable for working as a sensor to detect the waves. All the results demonstrate that the connecting type, number and thickness of the PZT wafers should be carefully selected to increase the efficiency and output of PiSSA actuators and sensors. This study contributes to providing a method to investigate the characteristics and optimize the structural parameters of the proposed PiSSAs.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-11-15", "authors": ["GuangtaoLu", "XinZhu", "TaoWang", "ZhiqiangHao", "BohaiTan"], "doi": "10.3390/s20226438\n10.3390/s18061881\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.06.006\n10.3390/app8112304\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.208\n10.3390/s18051377\n10.1177/1475921718790188\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107075\n10.1177/1475921719854151\n10.1177/1475921716670573\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095030\n10.1007/s13349-018-0318-z\n10.3390/app7080789\n10.1177/1475921719898862\n10.1177/1475921718815803\n10.1177/1475921717735505\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.3390/s20072149\n10.1177/1045389X16679293\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab3add\n10.1109/TIE.2020.3003634\n10.1177/1475921720918890\n10.1007/s11071-020-05508-7\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa815c\n10.3390/s20205896\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa973e\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.10.008\n10.3390/s20216054\n10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115754\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.102131\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2017.10.002\n10.1177/1045389X16666184\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.04.036\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000904\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2971854\n10.3390/app10062018\n10.1155/2013/218026\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/2/010\n10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000066\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/11/115031\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa891a\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/12/125030\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105035\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2302893\n10.1080/19475411.2015.1089525\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.05.042\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6768\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/026\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/12/125026\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301\n10.3390/s20185398\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.06.153\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115020\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.3390/s19051107\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa849a\n10.3390/s19020425\n10.1016/j.measurement.2016.01.042\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.3390/app10010050\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.056\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095008\n10.3390/s17122801\n10.3390/s19071501\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9c72\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2843788\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80bc\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80ef\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae0a7\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/1/015005\n10.1177/1045389X13479185\n10.12989/sss.2014.14.3.267\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.07.005\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae007\n10.1109/TMECH.2019.2959087\n10.3390/s17122796\n10.1063/1.3067231\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab4e09"}

Here, we propose a biomimetic artificially innervated foam by embedding three-dimensional electrodes within a new low-modulus self-healing foam material. The foam material is synthesized from a one-step self-foaming process. By tuning the concentration of conductive metal particles in the foam at near-percolation, we demonstrate that it can operate as a piezo-impedance sensor in both piezoresistive and piezocapacitive sensing modes without the need for an encapsulation layer. The sensor is sensitive to an object's contact force directions as well as to human proximity. Moreover, the foam material self-heals autonomously with immediate function restoration despite mechanical damage.

The TID characteristics of the H-DM are analyzed using the finite element method, and the wavefront compensation capability of the novel H-DM is also investigated in simulation. In the experiment, the initial surface shape and the TID characteristics of a lab-manufactured H-DM are measured. The experimental results show that the H-DM has a good initial surface shape, and no actuator-corresponding high-frequency distortion exists in the surface shape of the H-DM when the environment temperature changes.

{"title": "Evolution of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in aerobic sludge granulation: Composition, adherence and viscoelastic properties.", "abstract": "Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a promising wastewater treatment innovation, but its instability hinders its broader applications. Understanding the granulation process is vital to address this issue. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an essential role in sludge granulation. However, one crucial aspect of EPS, the adhesive and viscoelastic properties, has been neglected in AGS studies. In this study, we set up two reactors fed with COD/N ratios of 100: 5 (R1) and 100: 10 (R2) for comparison, to investigate the adhesive and viscoelastic properties of sludge EPS during the sludge granulation. We found that R2 showed a more rapid sludge granulation with more stable granules formed, contained a higher abundance of amoA gene, and had a higher production of polysaccharides than R1. We also found a sharp decrease in polysaccharide production and \u03b2-sheets abundance accompanied by granule size decrease in R1 on Day 80, indicating their essential roles in sludge granulation and granule stability. QCM-D (quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) results showed that EPS became less adhesive and inclined to form unstable layers on the mineral surfaces along with the sludge granulation process. In contrast, they showed the opposite behavior and became more adhesive on the PVDF sensors. Our results suggested that higher polysaccharides, a higher \u03b2-sheets band in proteins, and lower mineral surface-adhesive and viscoelastic properties benefited the aerobic sludge granulation process and the granule maintenance.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2020-11-14", "authors": ["YijingShi", "YangLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128033"}

Although matrix-embedded osteocytes are considered as the key mechanoresponsive bone cells, all other skeletal cell types are principally exposed to macroenvironmental and microenvironmental mechanical influences that could potentially affect their activities. It was recently reported that Piezo1, one of the two mechanically activated ion channels of the Piezo family, functions as a mechanosensor in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Here we show that Piezo1 additionally plays a critical role in the process of endochondral bone formation. More specifically, by targeted deletion of Piezo1 or Piezo2 in either osteoblast (Runx2Cre) or osteoclast lineage cells (Lyz2Cre), we observed severe osteoporosis with numerous spontaneous fractures specifically in Piezo1", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["GretlHendrickx", "VerenaFischer", "AstridLiedert", "Simonvon Kroge", "MelanieHaffner-Luntzer", "LauraBrylka", "EvaPawlus", "MichaelaSchweizer", "TimurYorgan", "AnkeBaranowsky", "TimRolvien", "MonaNeven", "UdoSchumacher", "David JBeech", "MichaelAmling", "AnitaIgnatius", "ThorstenSchinke"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.4198"}
{"title": "Nanoscale assembling of graphene oxide with electrophoretic deposition leads to superior percolation network in Li-ion electrodes: TiNb", "abstract": "In this paper, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is shown to promote nanoscale assembling of graphene oxide (GO) enabling the fabrication of highly homogeneous, robust, and capacity fade resistant composite titanium niobate (TiNb2O7, TNO)/rGO anodes upon reductive annealing. Control tests revealed that EPD is superior to conventional PVDF-based casting in maximizing the performance benefits from using reduced GO in Li-ion electrode fabrication as is the case of TNO that is plagued with conductivity and capacity fading problems. In this particular study, we show that there is a synergy developed between GO and EPD with the former (1) stabilizing the EPD suspension, (2) acting as a flexible binder net that affords mechanical integrity during the volume expansion of TNO, (3) serving as a conductive filler, and (4) contributing to Li-ion storage via pseudocapacitance. As a consequence, a superior percolation network is developed. Thus while both EPD- and PVDF- built TNO/rGO composite anodes exhibited high initial capacities (\u223c350 and 318 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C cycling, respectively, their cycling behaviour was quite different with the latter experiencing high internal polarization and extended degradation. Post-mortem PEEM-XANES analysis clearly demonstrated a highly homogeneous mesostructure in the case of the EPD-built TNO/rGO anode vs. a highly segregated and dis-jointed rGO and TNO component clustering in the PVDF-built electrode.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["MariannaUceda", "Hsien-ChiehChiu", "JigangZhou", "RaynaldGauvin", "KarimZaghib", "George PDemopoulos"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nr06082h"}

{"title": "Structural Health Monitoring Using Fibre Optic Acoustic Emission Sensors.", "abstract": "Acoustic emission (AE) is widely used for condition monitoring of critical components and structures. Conventional AE techniques employ wideband or resonant piezoelectric sensors to detect elastic stress waves propagating through various types of structural materials, including composites during damage evolution. Recent developments in fibre optic acoustic emission sensors (FOAES) have enabled new ways of detecting and monitoring damage evolution using AE. An optical fibre consists of a core with a high refractive index and a surrounding cladding. The buffer layer and outer jacket both act as protective polymer layers. Glass optical fibres can be used for manufacturing AE sensors of sufficiently small size to enable their embedding into fibre-reinforced polymer composite materials. The embedding process protects the FOAES against environmental stresses prolonging operational lifetime. The immunity of FOAES to electromagnetic interference makes this type of sensor attractive for condition monitoring purposes across a wide range of challenging operational environments.

Different temperature dependent band splitting behaviors are observed at the [Formula: see text] and M points. The energy of the band splitting near the M point decreases as the temperature decreases while it has little temperature dependence near the [Formula: see text] point. The nematic nature of the band shift near the M point is confirmed through a detwin experiment using a piezo device.

In the modified cell, two load cells are installed at the top and bottom plates, respectively. To generate and detect the compressional and shear waves, a pair of piezo disk elements and a pair of bender elements are mounted at both the top and bottom plates. Experimental results show that the stresses measured at the bottom are smaller than those measured at the top during the loading and vice versa during unloading, regardless of the densities and heights of the specimens. Under nearly saturated conditions, the compressional wave velocities remain almost constant for the entire stress state.

Microfluidic techniques with various functions and extensions have often been used for such purposes to investigate the mechanical properties of microscopic objects such as biological cells. One of such extensions proposed in this context is a real-time visual feedback manipulation system, which is composed of a high-speed camera and a piezoelectric actuator with a single-line microfluidic channel. Although the on-chip manipulation system enables us to control the 1 degree-of-freedom position of a target object by the real-time pressure control, it has suffered from unintended changes in the object orientation, which is out of control in the previous system. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a novel shear-flow-based mechanism for the control of the orientation of a target object in addition to the position control in a microchannel to overcome the problem of the unintended rotation. We designed a tributary channel using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation with boundary conditions appropriate for the particle manipulation to apply shear stress to the target particle placed at the junction and succeeded in rotating the particle at an angular velocity of 0.2\u2009rad/s even under the position control in the experiment.

Such unique attributes include the manifestation of highly tuneable bandgap semiconductors, reduced dielectric screening, highly enhanced many body interactions, the ability to withstand high strains, ferromagnetism, piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects. Using 2Dm for mechanical resonators has become a promising field in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) for applications involving sensors and condensed matter physics investigations. 2Dm NEMS resonators react with their environment, exhibit highly nonlinear behaviour from tension induced stiffening effects and couple different physics domains. The small size and high stiffness of these devices possess the potential of highly enhanced force sensitivities for measuring a wide variety of un-investigated physical forces. This review highlights current research in 2Dm NEMS resonators from fundamental physics and an applications standpoint, as well as presenting future possibilities using these devices.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2020-11-06", "authors": ["TanjuYildirim", "LinglongZhang", "Guru PrakashNeupane", "SongsongChen", "JiaweiZhang", "HanYan", "Md MehediHasan", "GenkiYoshikawa", "YueruiLu"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nr06773c"}

{"title": "Structural Insight in the Interfacial Effect in Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Both experimental results and theoretical models suggest the decisive role of the filler-matrix interfaces on the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and electrocaloric properties of ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. However, there remains a lack of direct structural evidence to support the so-called interfacial effect in dielectric nanocomposites. Here, a chemical mapping of the interfacial coupling between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites by combining atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) with first-principles calculations and phase-field simulations is provided. The addition of ceramic fillers into a ferroelectric polymer leads to augmentation of the local conformational disorder in the vicinity of the interface, resulting in the local stabilization of the all-trans conformation (i.e., the polar \u03b2 phase). The formation of highly polar and inhomogeneous interfacial regions, which is further enhanced with a decrease of the filler size, has been identified experimentally and verified by phase-field simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work offers unprecedented structural insights into the configurational disorder-induced interfacial effect and will enable rational design and molecular engineering of the filler-matrix interfaces of electroactive polymer nanocomposites to boost their collective properties.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2020-11-06", "authors": ["YangLiu", "TiannanYang", "BingZhang", "TeagueWilliams", "Yen-TingLin", "LiLi", "YaoZhou", "WenchangLu", "Seong HKim", "Long-QingChen", "JBernholc", "QingWang"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202005431"}
{"title": "An innovative risk-scoring system of dental procedures and safety protocols in the COVID-19 era.", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to assess an innovative risk score for common dental procedures, based on the most recent contaminant SARS-CoV-2. After scoring the level of infection risk, safety procedures, advice and personal protective equipment (PPE) are recommended for the dental team in each dental practice.\nThe authors of this research analysed 42 common dental procedures on the basis of known transmission risks. In increasing order, many consider the parameters leading to different risk scores for the dental team and patients for each procedure to be: direct contact with saliva (score 1), direct contact with blood (score 2), production of low levels of spray/aerosol via air-water syringes (score 3), the production of high levels of spray/aerosol from rotating, ultrasound and piezoelectric tools (score 4); and the duration of the procedure, which may increase the risk of procedures producing droplets and aerosols.\nUsing this innovative risk-scoring system, the authors classified the different dental procedures according to low, medium or high risk: low (1-3), medium (4-5), high (\u2265\u20096). A safety protocol for each procedure was thereafter matched with the calculated risk level.\nThe innovative risk-scoring system presented in this research permits the reclassification of dental procedures according to the infection risk level. Consequently, specific procedures, previously considered as entry level, will now merit revision.

Herein, a controllable Janus nozzle was employed to innovatively electrospin natural loofah/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers with a core-shell structure for gravity-driven water purification. By adjusting flow rates of the PVDF component, a core-shell structure of the composite fibers was obtained caused by the lower viscosity and surface tension of PVDF. In addition, a steady laminar motion of fluids was constructed based on the Reynolds number of flow fields being less than 2300. In order to investigate the formation mechanism of the microstructure, a series of Janus nozzles with different lengths were controlled to study the blending of the two immiscible components. The gravity difference between the two components might cause disturbance of the jet motion, and the PVDF component unidirectionally encapsulated the loofah to form the shell layer. Most importantly, the dry loofah/PVDF membranes could separate oil from an oil-water mixture, while the water-wetted membrane exhibited switchable separation that could separate water from the mixtures because of the hydroxyl groups of the hydrophilic loofah hydrogen-bonding with water molecules and forming a hydration layer.

In mobile ultrasound instruments, the sensitivity of piezoelectric transducers is a critical parameter under limited power supply from portable batteries. Therefore, the enhancement of the output voltage amplitude of the amplifier under limited power supply could increase the sensitivity of the piezoelectric transducer. Several-stage TVAs are used to increase the voltage amplitude. However, inter-stage design issues between each TVA block may reduce the voltage amplitude and bandwidth because the electronic components of the amplifier are nonlinearly operated at the desired frequency ranges. To compensate for this effect, we propose a novel inter-stage output voltage amplitude improvement (OVAI) circuit integrated with a class-B TVA circuit. We performed fundamental A-mode pulse-echo tests using a 15-MHz immersion-type piezoelectric transducer to verify the design.

First, a fluidic liquid-liquid interface consisting of two miscible solvents was created by introducing nonsolvent (water) under the PVDF solution. After the interface was created, the interface moved up to the DMF phase direction; PVDF NPs were produced through nonsolvent-induced phase separation. As the water content decreased in the nonsolvent by mixing with methanol, PVDF structures changed from nanoparticles with 252 nm average diameter (PVDF NP-1) to a porous membrane through membrane-wrapped NPs. The phenomena were found to be related to the mutual affinity of solvent, nonsolvent, and PVDF. When an additional external force was introduced to the water-DMF-PVDF system through magnetic stirring (reprecipitation method), smaller PVDF NPs with 61.4 nm diameter were obtained (PVDF NP-2). Both the as-prepared PVDF NPs were demonstrated with the predominant ferroelectric (electroactive (EA)) phase up to 97-98% among crystalline phases, which is apparently the highest value ever reported for PVDF homopolymer NPs. It is noteworthy that PVDF NP-2 showed a higher \u03b2 phase ratio than that of PVDF NP-1, as proved using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Also, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed that PVDF NP-1 exhibited higher crystallinity and that PVDF NP-2 underwent a well-separated two-step phase transition under heating. Results suggest that controlling interface formation with DMF and water plays a crucial role in manipulating ferroelectric PVDF nanostructures in terms of crystallinity and the ferroelectric \u03b2 phase-to-\u03b3 phase ratio.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2020-11-05", "authors": ["ChangFu", "HuieZhu", "NorihisaHoshino", "TomoyukiAkutagawa", "MasayaMitsuishi"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02667"}

Stretchable piezoelectric strain sensors received an ever-increasing interest to design novel, robust and low-cost sensing units for these sensors, with intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) as leading materials. We investigated a sensitive element based on crosslinked electrospun nanofibers (NFs) directly collected and thermal treated on a flexible and biocompatible substrate of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The nanostructured active layer based on a blend of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the ICP was optimized, especially in terms of the thermal treatment that promotes electrical conductivity through crosslinking of PEO and PSS, preserving the nanostructuration and optimizing the coupling between the sensitive layer and the substrate. We demonstrate that excellent properties can be obtained thanks to the nanostructured active materials. We analyzed the piezoresistive response of the sensor in both compression and traction modes, obtaining an increase in the electrical resistance up to 90%.

{"title": "Effect of physical parameters and temperature on the piezo-electric jetting behaviour of UV-curable photochromic inks.", "abstract": "Although resource-efficient processes like inkjet printing have a large potential to foster the development of smart and functional textiles, one bottleneck still is the development of functional inks. To make inkjet printing and UV curing given production techniques for smart and functional specialty products, e.g. photochromic textiles, deepened knowledge about the development, rheological behavior and jetting behavior of functional ink is needed. This paper focuses on the formulation and performance of UV-responsive and UV-curable inkjet inks, which are based on photochromic dyes and their application to produce UV-responsive textiles. Two commercial photochromic dyes-Reversacol Ruby Red (RR) and Sea Green (SG), which represent dyes of the naphthopyran and spirooxazine class, respectively, have been used to develop the inks. The photochromic inks are characterized according to their physical-chemical and rheological properties in respect to temperature. The influence of temperature on the drop formation of the inks in an industrial print head is analyzed using a high-speed camera, which reveals important information regarding challenges in ink jettability. It was found that the dye structure and type used in the ink can influence the jetting behavior of photochromic UV-curable ink. More pronounced temperature sensitivity of dyes can increase the temperature-related effects of drop formation as was observed for SG ink. The printability of the RR and SG inks is framed and underpinned by theoretical calculations of the Z number.

{"title": "Dynamic Modeling and Experimental Validation of an Impact-Driven Piezoelectric Energy Harvester in Magnetic Field.", "abstract": "In this study, an impact-driven piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) in magnetic field is presented. The PEH consists of a piezoelectric cantilever beam and plural magnets. At its initial status, the beam tip magnet is attracted by a second magnet. The second magnet is moved away by hand and then the beam tip magnet moves to a third magnet by the guidance of the magnetic fields. The impact occurs when the beam motion is stopped by the third magnet. The impact between magnets produces an impact energy and causes a transient beam vibration. The electric energy is generated by the piezoelectric effect. Based on the energy principle, a multi-DOF (multi-degree of freedom) mathematical model was developed to calculate the displacements, velocities, and voltage outputs of the PEH. A prototype of the PEH was fabricated. The voltages outputs of the beam were monitored by an oscilloscope. The maximum generated energy was about 0.4045 mJ for a single impact.

{"title": "Non-contact measurement of the thickness of a surface film using a superimposed ultrasonic standing wave.", "abstract": "Most methods used to measure the thickness of thin liquid or solid surface films and coatings need access to the coated surface. In this work reflected ultrasonic pulses were used to measure a coating thickness from a solid back face. Piezoelectric transducers on the solid back face emitted ultrasound waves and received the waves that bounced off the front face. The magnitude of the reflected wave was dependent on the film thickness at the front face. Most pulse-echo ultrasonic approaches use the time-of-flight through the surface layer to determine its thickness. However, as the film becomes thinner, the reflected echoes overlap and there is often an acoustic mismatch between the solid and the surface film that reduces the signal strength. In this work, we propose the use of an ultrasonic continuously repeated chirp longitudinal wave to amplify the effect of the surface film. Multiple reflections interfere within the solid to form a superimposed standing wave whose amplitude spectrum is highly dependent on the surface film thickness thus overcoming the acoustic mismatch problem. Two bare 10\u00a0MHz piezoelectric elements were bonded to a 10\u00a0mm thick aluminium solid in a pitch-catch arrangement such that one continuously sends repeating chirp ultrasound waves and the other acts as the receiver. The transmitter was set to send a repeating chirp wave of 4\u00a0ms duration corresponding to the bandwidth of the transducer in order to maximise signal amplitude. The incident and reflected waves constructively and destructively interfere to form a superimposed standing wave within the solid. The solid/surface film to solid/air boundary condition frequency spectra ratio showed the film resonant frequency modes as minima. Using this technique epoxy coatings ranging from 70\u00a0\u03bcm to 350\u00a0\u03bcm were measured and showed a good correlation with independent measurements using a surface profilometer.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-11-03", "authors": ["JKanja", "RMills", "XLi", "HBrunskill", "A KHunter", "R SDwyer-Joyce"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106291"}

Stress sensing based on mechanoluminescence (ML) shows significant advantages of distributed detection and remote response to mechanical stimuli and is thus expected to be a key technology of next-generation tactile sensors and stress recorders. However, the instantaneous photon emission in ML materials generally requires real-time recording with a photodetector, thus limiting their application fields to real-time stress sensing. In this paper, we report a force-induced charge carrier storage (FICS) effect in deep-trap ML materials, which enables storage of the applied mechanical energy in deep traps and then release of the stored energy as photon emission under thermal stimulation. The FICS effect was confirmed in five ML materials with piezoelectric structures, efficient emission centres and deep trap distributions, and its mechanism was investigated through detailed spectroscopic characterizations. Furthermore, we demonstrated three applications of the FICS effect in electronic signature recording, falling point monitoring and vehicle collision recording, which exhibited outstanding advantages of distributed recording, long-term storage, and no need for a continuous power supply.

{"title": "An innovative technique for electronic transport model of group-III nitrides.", "abstract": "An optimized empirical pseudopotential method (EPM) in conjunction with virtual crystal approximation (VCA) and the compositional disorder effect is used for simulation to extract the electronic material parameters of wurtzite nitride alloys to ensure excellent agreement with the experiments. The proposed direct bandgap results of group-III nitride alloys are also compared with the different density functional theories (DFT) based theoretical results. The model developed in current work, significantly improves the accuracy of calculated band gaps as compared to the ab-initio method based results. The physics of carrier transport in binary and ternary nitride materials is investigated with the help of in-house developed Monte Carlo algorithms for solution of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) including nonlinear scattering mechanisms. Carrier-carrier scattering mechanisms defined through Coulomb-, piezoelectric-, ionized impurity-, surface roughness-scattering with acoustic and intervalley scatterings, all have been given due consideration in present model. The direct and indirect energy bandgap results have been calibrated with the experimental data and use of symmetric and asymmetric form factors associated with respective materials.

In the literature, such biosensors are commonly fabricated using antibodies, aptamers, proteins and nanomaterials, whereas electrochemical, optical and piezoelectric techniques are used for detection. This review describes how these measurement techniques and transducers can be used to fabricate biosensors for detecting lymphocytes and the total content of immunoglobulins. The various methods and configurations are reported, along with the advantages and current limitations.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2020-10-31", "authors": ["PietroSalvo", "Federico MVivaldi", "AndreaBonini", "DeniseBiagini", "Francesca GBellagambi", "Filippo MMiliani", "Fabio DiFrancesco", "TommasoLomonaco"], "doi": "10.3390/bios10110155\n10.3390/bios9030086\n10.1016/j.jaci.2009.09.046\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02308.x\n10.3892/ol.2018.8378\n10.1097/QAI.0000000000001843\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01869\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.16526\n10.1038/jid.2012.282\n10.1002/cyto.a.20910\n10.3390/ijms16059804\n10.1016/j.jim.2006.10.009\n10.1177/37.1.2491755\n10.1128/CVI.00354-06\n10.1016/0022-1759(90)90395-C\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04127\n10.1039/B705082H\n10.1016/j.anai.2019.10.019\n10.1111/j.1365-2222.1975.tb01832.x\n10.1038/s41598-020-61455-8\n10.1128/CDLI.7.2.131-140.2000\n10.1186/1742-6413-2-14\n10.1039/b714449k\n10.1016/j.ab.2005.11.033\n10.1016/S0003-2670(01)01137-0\n10.1007/s00449-007-0173-5\n10.1007/s40828-015-0016-y\n10.1016/j.snb.2006.09.024\n10.1038/s41570-017-0076\n10.3390/molecules201219739\n10.1007/s00216-018-1201-9\n10.1016/j.aca.2012.10.019\n10.1016/j.ab.2014.08.019\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.12.006\n10.1016/j.bios.2007.06.005\n10.1016/j.talanta.2009.11.035\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.009\n10.1021/ac00279a004\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.01.069\n10.1016/j.elecom.2013.02.001\n10.1021/ac60350a021\n10.1039/C5RA22654F\n10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00041\n10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00361\n10.1039/C9AY01257E\n10.1016/S0925-4005(99)00081-7\n10.3390/s80314000\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.001\n10.1007/s11164-014-1669-7\n10.1002/bit.22395\n10.1039/c3ay26476a\n10.1007/s00604-010-0382-5\n10.3390/app10114012\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.052\n10.1039/b805301b\n10.1002/elan.200804552\n10.1155/2018/3019259\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114371\n10.1016/S0925-4005(98)00321-9\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.03.013\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.03.031\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.004\n10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.044\n10.1186/s11671-017-1903-5\n10.1109/TIM.2018.2875961\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.03.053\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.03.165\n10.1016/j.talanta.2018.03.075\n10.3390/s7060797\n10.1016/j.optcom.2018.05.058\n10.1016/j.optlastec.2020.106445\n10.3390/ma11030448\n10.1007/BF01337937\n10.1021/ac00285a062\n10.1016/S0960-894X(01)80404-2\n10.1039/an9952002829\n10.1006/abio.1999.4186\n10.20964/2018.09.01\n10.1016/S0003-2670(97)00596-5\n10.1039/C4NR06461E\n10.1016/j.snb.2008.01.048\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.12.065\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.053\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.11.055\n10.1016/j.bios.2005.01.011\n10.1515/ijnsns-2012-0400\n10.1039/c3mb25421f\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.04.047\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.08.007\n10.1016/j.cclet.2012.10.017\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.10.029\n10.1021/acssensors.8b00523\n10.1016/j.snb.2006.10.034\n10.1021/acssensors.8b01628\n10.1021/acsami.9b06535\n10.3390/s100605798\n10.1089/adt.2006.4.555\n10.1016/j.jim.2005.10.018\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.07.005\n10.1155/2013/210726\n10.1038/s41598-018-23368-5"}

Many different actuation mechanisms have been used, including self-oscillation, piezoelectric shakers, capacitive excitation, and optically pumping via the optical gradient force.

We provide a practical framework for designing optical cavities and optomechanical systems to maximize the efficiency of the optical pumping technique. The effects of coherent backscattering on detection and actuation are included. We verify our results experimentally and show good agreement between the model and experiment.

Natural vermiculites expand rapidly in volume when heated above 800 \u00b0C. MgO powder is used to evenly transmit the surface temperature of a heater rod, which can attain high temperatures rapidly, to the vermiculites. The insertion direction of the heater rod greatly affects the expansion pressure. Three cuboid rock specimens are prepared and equipped with the heating system at different hole-to-face distances. Crack propagation is monitored by a pair of disk-shaped piezoelectric transducers. For short hole-to-face distances, the wave velocity and maximum amplitude rapidly decrease after certain time. For the greatest hole-to-face distance, the shear wave velocity remains constant during the test, while the maximum amplitude decreases after a certain time. The time taken for the velocity and amplitude of the shear waves to decrease reasonably corresponded to that taken for detectable crack propagation to occur on the surface of the rock specimen.

{"title": "A Novel Fetal Movement Simulator for the Performance Evaluation of Vibration Sensors for Wearable Fetal Movement Monitors.", "abstract": "Fetal movements (FM) are an important factor in the assessment of fetal health. However, there is currently no reliable way to monitor FM outside clinical environs. While extensive research has been carried out using accelerometer-based systems to monitor FM, the desired accuracy of detection is yet to be achieved. A major challenge has been the difficulty of testing and calibrating sensors at the pre-clinical stage. Little is known about fetal movement features, and clinical trials involving pregnant women can be expensive and ethically stringent. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FM simulator, which can be used to test responses of sensor arrays in a laboratory environment. The design uses a silicon-based membrane with material properties similar to that of a gravid abdomen to mimic the vibrations due to fetal kicks. The simulator incorporates mechanisms to pre-stretch the membrane and to produce kicks similar to that of a fetus. As a case study, we present results from a comparative study of an acoustic sensor, an accelerometer, and a piezoelectric diaphragm as candidate vibration sensors for a wearable FM monitor. We find that the acoustic sensor and the piezoelectric diaphragm are better equipped than the accelerometer to determine durations, intensities, and locations of kicks, as they have a significantly greater response to changes in these conditions than the accelerometer. Additionally, we demonstrate that the acoustic sensor and the piezoelectric diaphragm can detect weaker fetal movements (threshold wall displacements are less than 0.5 mm) compared to the accelerometer (threshold wall displacement is 1.5 mm) with a trade-off of higher power signal artefacts.

To assess the accuracy of the model, a signal processing method based on frequency shifting transformation and the Pearson correlation coefficient is also proposed to calculate the similarity between theoretically predicted and experimentally measured data.

Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among men, and the principal reason of death due to this cancer is the inappropriate detecting tools. Therefore, there is a great request for accurate diagnosis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Bio-analysis based on biomarkers might help to overcome this problem. Aptamers can be employed as high-affinity tools for cancer detection. The utilization of aptamer-based strategy in cancer investigation has demonstrated new horizons in biotechnology. The use of nanotechnology in biosensing is a serious development in this field. Advanced nanomaterials enhance the signal amplification in the biosensors, which also reduce the time required for diagnosis and analysis, they are also affordable, with high accuracy.

{"title": "Epitaxial Nanostructured \u03b1-Quartz Films on Silicon: From the Material to New Devices.", "abstract": "In this work, we show a detailed engineering route of the first piezoelectric nanostructured epitaxial quartz-based microcantilever. We will explain all the steps in the process starting from the material to the device fabrication. The epitaxial growth of \u03b1-quartz film on SOI (100) substrate starts with the preparation of a strontium doped silica sol-gel and continues with the deposition of this gel into the SOI substrate in a thin film form using the dip-coating technique under atmospheric conditions at room temperature. Before crystallization of the gel film, nanostructuration is performed onto the film surface by nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Epitaxial film growth is reached at 1000 \u00b0C, inducing a perfect crystallization of the patterned gel film. Fabrication of quartz crystal cantilever devices is a four-step process based on microfabrication techniques. The process starts with shaping the quartz surface, and then metal deposition for electrodes follows it. After removing the silicone, the cantilever is released from SOI substrate eliminating SiO2 between silicon and quartz. The device performance is analyzed by non-contact laser vibrometer (LDV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Among the different cantilever's dimensions included in the fabricated chip, the nanostructured cantilever analyzed in this work exhibited a dimension of 40 \u00b5m large and 100 \u00b5m long and was fabricated with a 600 nm thick patterned quartz layer (nanopillar diameter and separation distance of 400 nm and 1 \u00b5m, respectively) epitaxially grown on a 2 \u00b5m thick Si device layer. The\u00a0measured\u00a0resonance frequency was\u00a0267 kHz and the estimated quality factor, Q, of the whole mechanical structure was Q ~ 398 under low vacuum conditions.

Here, we report on \"optical skin\" strain sensors based on elastomer-supported, highly ordered, and closely packed plasmonic nanocrystal arrays (plasmene). Using gold nanocubes (AuNCs) as a model system, we find that the types of polymeric ligands, interparticle spacing, and AuNC sizes play vital roles in strain-induced plasmonic responses. In particular, brush-forming polystyrene (PS) is a \"good\" ligand for forming elastic plasmenes which display strain-induced blue shift of high-energy plasmonic peaks with high reversibility upon strain release. Further experimental and simulation studies reveal the transition from isotropic uniform plasmon coupling at a non-strained state to anisotropic plasmon coupling at strained states, due to the AuNC alignment perpendicular to the straining direction. The two-term plasmonic ruler model may predict the primary high-energy peak location. Using the relative shift of the averaged high-energy peak to the coupling peak before straining, a plasmene nanosheet may be used as a strain sensor with the sensitivity depending on its internal structures, such as the constituent AuNC size or inter-particle spacing.", "journal": "Nanoscale horizons", "date": "2020-10-27", "authors": ["RunfangFu", "TharinduWarnakula", "QianqianShi", "Lim WeiYap", "DashenDong", "YiyiLiu", "MalinPremaratne", "WenlongCheng"], "doi": "10.1039/d0nh00393j"}

Miniaturization is a key design goal for such implants to reduce tissue displacement and enable minimally invasive implantation techniques. Here, we provide a systematic design approach for the implant piezo geometry and operation frequency to minimize the overall volume of the implant. Optimal geometry of the implant piezo for backscatter communication is discussed and contrasted with that of power harvesting.

The PAAm organogel obtained by swelling the PAAm scaffold in the dimethyl sulfoxide solution of organic electrochromic material (OECM) shows an extremely large stretchability with an elongation of 1600%, a supersoftness with a compressive modulus of 7.2 kPa, an excellent transmittance up to 90%, and a very fast response time of 0.5 s combined with the characteristic of interactive color changing. The PAAm organogel also suggests a universal design ability to tailor coloration spectra for tactile sensors via simply changing the type and content of OECM. The tactile sensor based on a PAAm organogel is capable of serving as a wearable device for precisely tracing human body motion performance and directly visualizing the stress distribution via interactive color changing capability.

{"title": "Characterization of the stimulation output of four devices for focal muscle vibration.", "abstract": "Different devices for mechano-acoustic muscle vibration became available on the market in the last ten years. Although the use of these vibrators is increasing in research and clinical settings, the features of their stimulation output were never described in literature. In this study we aimed to quantify and compare the stimulation output of the four most widespread pneumatic devices for focal muscle vibration available on the market. A piezoelectric pressure sensor was used to measure the pressure profile generated by the four selected devices in the following experimental conditions: i) measurement of the output changes associated with variations of the stimulation amplitude for three stimulation frequencies (100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 300 Hz); ii) measurement of the output changes during a 20-min long stimulation at constant frequency (300 Hz) and amplitude; iii) measurement of the output changes associated with the progressive activation of all stimulation channels at constant frequency (200 Hz) for different amplitudes. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes of the pressure waves were in the range 102 mbar - 369 mbar (below the maximum values declared by the different manufacturers). The shape of the pressure waves generated by the four devices was quasi-sinusoidal and asymmetric with respect to the atmospheric pressure. All output features had a remarkable intra- and inter-device variability. Further studies are required to support the technological improvement of the currently available devices and to focus the issues of vibration effectiveness, limitations, proper protocols, modalities of its application and assessment in neuromuscular training and rehabilitation.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2020-10-22", "authors": ["AlbertoBotter", "Giacinto LuigiCerone", "RaoulSaggini", "GiuseppeMassazza", "Marco AlessandroMinetto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.10.002"}

{"title": "A Theoretical and Experimental Study of a Piezoelectric Pump with Two Elastic Chambers.", "abstract": "The paper is a continuation of our work on the dynamic load in piezoelectric pumps. In the study, the dynamic load of liquid in the pipelines was proposed as a key factor that limits the output performance of piezoelectric pumps. To decrease the dynamic load, a piezoelectric pump with two elastic chambers was proposed in our previous published work. In this paper, the performance and key parameters of the piezoelectric pump with two elastic chambers were studied through theoretical analyses and experimental tests. After establishing the mathematical model of the piezoelectric pump with two elastic chambers, the paper theoretically analyzed the performance of the pump and the effect of different structural parameters on the performance. Then prototypes with a range of structural parameters were developed and tested. As revealed from the test results, the elastic chamber effectively decreased the dynamic load of the liquid in the pipelines and the flow rate of the prototype with two elastic chambers was higher than that of the prototype with one or no elastic chamber. However, the elastic chamber did not lead to the increase in the maximum output backpressure of the prototype. Adopting an elastic diaphragm exhibiting a smaller stiffness or a larger diameter could help decrease the dynamic load of the liquid. The elastic chamber more significantly impacted the flow rate of the piezoelectric pump with long pipelines. The pump chamber height had a significant effect on the output performance of the piezoelectric pump with two elastic chambers, which is consistent with the conventional piezoelectric pump. At the height of 0.2 mm, the flow rate of the prototype with two elastic chambers was peaked at 7.7 mL/min; at the height of 0.05 mm, the output backpressure reached the highest of 28.2 kPa. The dynamic load could decrease the amplitude of the piezoelectric vibrator, whereas the prototype with two elastic chambers could effectively reduce the impact of dynamic load on the piezoelectric vibrator. The flow rate decreased almost linearly with the backpressure. Under the same backpressure, the flow rate of the prototype with two elastic chambers was higher than that of the prototype without elastic chamber, and the flow rate difference between the two prototypes gradually decreased with the backpressure.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-10-22", "authors": ["XiaolongZhao", "DingxuanZhao", "QingheGuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s20205867\n10.1007/s00542-019-04743-2\n10.3390/s17040755\n10.1007/s10404-008-0266-8\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.010\n10.1007/s10832-012-9740-5\n10.1007/s00542-018-3807-4\n10.1007/s00542-019-04535-8\n10.3901/JME.2003.05.107\n10.1177/1045389X12438628\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/11/115005\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.06.036\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.07.016\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/1/010\n10.3901/CJME.2004.04.591\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/1/015010\n10.1088/1361-6439/ab3278\n10.3390/s18072311\n10.1049/mnl.2018.5712\n10.1007/s10033-017-0151-z\n10.3901/CJME.2013.03.462\n10.1177/1045389X11418862\n10.3390/mi11080735\n10.3390/mi10030169"}
{"title": "A New Approach for Impedance Tracking of Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvesters Based on a Zeta Converter.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are a reduced, but fundamental, source of power for embedded, remote, and no-grid connected electrical systems. Some key limits, such as low power density, poor conversion efficiency, high internal impedance, and AC output, can be partially overcome by matching their internal electrical impedance to that of the applied resistance load. However, the applied resistance load can vary significantly in time, since it depends on the vibration frequency and the working temperature. Hence, a real-time tracking of the applied impedance load should be done to always harvest the maximum energy from the PEH. This paper faces the above problem by presenting an active control able to track and follow in time the optimal working point of a PEH. It exploits a non-conventional AC-DC converter, which integrates a single-stage DC-DC Zeta converter and a full-bridge active rectifier, controlled by a dedicated algorithm based on pulse-width modulation (PWM) with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). A prototype of the proposed converter, based on discrete components, was created and experimentally tested by applying a sudden variation of the resistance load, aimed to emulate a change in the excitation frequency from 30 to 70 Hz and a change in the operating temperature from 25 to 50 \u00b0C. Results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which allowed to match the optimal load after 0.38 s for a \u0394R of 47 k\u03a9 and after 0.15 s for a \u0394R of 18 k\u03a9.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-10-22", "authors": ["AntoninoQuattrocchi", "RobertoMontanini", "SalvatoreDe Caro", "SaverioPanarello", "TommasoScimone", "SalvatoreFoti", "AntonioTesta"], "doi": "10.3390/s20205862\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.23\n10.1109/TPEL.2019.2894465\n10.1007/978-0-387-76464-1\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.015\n10.1007/s12541-011-0151-3\n10.1364/AO.55.007142\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.034\n10.1002/er.4441\n10.24084/repqj11.268\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.09.503\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.08.022\n10.1115/1.4028309\n10.1063/1.4952675\n10.1016/j.mejo.2011.05.005\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.009\n10.1109/TIE.2009.2037652\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2167116\n10.3390/s17040901\n10.1109/TPEL.2003.809379\n10.1109/TCSII.2019.2921349\n10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172960\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.12.006\n10.1109/TPEL.2007.904230\n10.1049/iet-cds.2018.5576\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.036\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.07.006\n10.1109/TIM.2020.3026462\n10.1109/TIE.2015.2415752\n10.1088/1742-6596/1052/1/012108"}

{"title": "Analytical and Experimental Study of Fatigue-Crack-Growth AE Signals in Thin Sheet Metals.", "abstract": "The acoustic emission (AE) method is a very popular and well-developed method for passive structural health monitoring of metallic and composite structures. AE method has been efficiently used for damage source detection and damage characterization in a large variety of structures over the years, such as thin sheet metals. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWASs) are lightweight and inexpensive transducers, which recently drew the attention of the AE research community for AE sensing. The focus of this paper is on understanding the fatigue crack growth AE signals in thin sheet metals recorded using PWAS sensors on the basis of the Lamb wave theory and using this understanding for predictive modeling of AE signals. After a brief introduction, the paper discusses the principles of sensing acoustic signals by using PWAS. The derivation of a closed-form expression for PWAS response due to a stress wave is presented. The transformations happening to the AE signal according to the instrumentations we used for the fatigue crack AE experiment is also discussed. It is followed by a summary of the in situ AE experiments performed for recording fatigue crack growth AE and the results. Then, we present an analytical model of fatigue crack growth AE and a comparison with experimental results. The fatigue crack growth AE source was modeled analytically using the dipole moment concept. By using the source modeling concept, the analytical predictive modeling and simulation of the AE were performed using normal mode expansion (NME). The simulation results showed good agreement with experimental results. A strong presence of nondispersive S0 Lamb wave mode due to the fatigue crack growth event was observed in the simulation and experiment.

The influence of surface-modified structure characteristics on electrical properties of energy harvester is systematically analyzed based on the finite element method. For vertical load mode, eight structures consisting of banded and disjunctive groups are compared to evaluate the voltage performance. The cylinder is proved to be the best structure of 3.25 V, compared to the pristine structure of 0.99 V (P(VDF-TrFE)). The relevant experiment has been done to verify the simulation. The relationship between radius, height, force and distance to the voltage output of the cylinder allocation is discussed. For periodical changing load mode, the cylinder modified structure shows a conspicuous enhancement in current output. The suitable resistance, current-voltage and frequency, the relationship between loading speed and current, and the ductility of current loading are studied.

{"title": "Impact-Driven Energy Harvesting: Piezoelectric Versus Triboelectric Energy Harvesters.", "abstract": "This work investigated the mechanical and electrical behaviors of piezoelectric and triboelectric energy harvesters (PEHs and TEHs, respectively) as potential devices for harvesting impact-driven energy. PEH and TEH test benches were designed and developed, aiming at harvesting low-frequency mechanical vibration generated by human activities, for example, a floor-tile energy harvester actuated by human footsteps. The electrical performance and behavior of these energy harvesters were evaluated and compared in terms of absolute energy and power densities that they provided and in terms of these energy and power densities normalized to unit material cost. Several aspects related to the design and development of PEHs and TEHs as the energy harvesting devices were investigated, covering the following topics: construction and mechanism of the energy harvesters; electrical characteristics of the fabricated piezoelectric and triboelectric materials; and characterization of the energy harvesters. At a 4 mm gap width between the cover plate and the stopper (the mechanical actuation components of both energy harvesters) and a cover plate pressing frequency of 2 Hz, PEH generated 27.64 mW, 1.90 mA, and 14.39 V across an optimal resistive load of 7.50 k\u03a9, while TEH generated 1.52 mW, 8.54 \u00b5A, and 177.91 V across an optimal resistive load of 21 M\u03a9.

In this study, IOP and intracranial pressure (ICP; a surrogate of CSFP) were measured at various body positions to quantify the determinants of TLP.\nWe have developed an implantable wireless pressure telemetry system based on a small piezoelectric sensor with low temporal drift. Telemetry transducers were placed in the anterior chamber to measure IOP and in the brain parenchyma at eye height to measure ICP. IOP was calibrated against anterior cannulation manometry, and ICP/CSFP was calibrated against an intraparenchymal Codman ICP Express microsensor. We measured IOP, ICP, and TLP = IOP - ICP continuously at 200 Hz in three male nonhuman primates (NHPs) in three trials; pressures were then averaged for 30 seconds per body position. Relative change of IOP, ICP, and TLP from the supine (baseline) position to the seated, standing, and inverted positions were quantified.\nTLP changed significantly and instantaneously from the supine to seated (+14 mm Hg), supine to standing (+13 mm Hg) and supine to inverted (-12 mm Hg) positions (P < 0.05). There was no significant TLP change for supine to prone. ICP showed greater relative change than IOP.\nTLP change due to body position change is driven more by ICP/CSFP than IOP. IOP, ICP, and TLP variability, coupled with telemetry, should allow us to test the hypotheses that IOP, ICP, or TLP fluctuations contribute independently to glaucoma onset or progression.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2020-10-20", "authors": ["Jessica VJasien", "Brian CSamuels", "James MJohnston", "J CrawfordDowns"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.61.12.18"}

This is a physiological response that starts from the connective tissue and influences the whole organism. We cross-fertilized various research areas with each other.\nThe matrix or the connective tissue forms a passive reservoir of substrate for the growth and development of cells, and functions as the primordial communication system of all living systems. It contains a continuous network of cells, such as fibroblasts, along with protein bundles made up of collagen that support electrical exchange through piezoelectric effects. This archaic vegetative system surrounds all cells, including neurons, and can thus be viewed as the primordial coordinating system in every organism. It is very likely the basis for a reflex which we describe here for the first time: the vegetative receptor vascular reflex. We also indicate some potential practical applications and test procedures.\nThe vegetative receptor vascular reflex describes the pathway from stimuli that originate in the connective tissue or the extracellular matrix toward organ systems. They might be chemical in nature or electrical via piezo-electric effects stimulating nerve endings, and thus can influence higher order processes such as regeneration or healing of tissue.

However, the developmental competence of aged oocytes from women of a late reproductive age is seriously reduced and the aged oocytes often fail in fertilization even when ART is used. To resolve this problem, we examined usefulness of a new method \"the metaphase II spindle transfer (MESI)\" as ART using mouse oocytes.\nThis work was composed of two experiments. First, 24\u00a0hours after collection, embryos from oocytes (1-day-old oocytes, called postovulatory-aged oocytes), were observed, after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and it was found that they were not able to reach the blastocyst stage. Next, the metaphase II chromosome-spindle complexes from 1-day-old oocytes were injected into cytoplasts from oocytes just collected, using piezo pulses to generate reconstructed oocytes. This procedure was named metaphase II spindle injection (MESI).\nAfter ICSI, embryos from the reconstructed oocytes (32/105), which contained the genes of 1-day-old oocytes, were able to develop into the blastocyst stage. The fragmentation rate after ICSI was 28.6%. Thus, the developmental competence of 1-day-old oocytes was improved by MESI.\nThe MESI method has the potential to improve the success rate of infertility treatments for women of a late reproductive age.", "journal": "Reproductive medicine and biology", "date": "2020-10-20", "authors": ["TatsuyukiOgawa", "HirokoFukasawa", "ShujiHirata"], "doi": "10.1002/rmb2.12335"}

In this work, poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(methyl methacrylate-co-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate) (PVDF/P(MMA-co-DMAEMA)) blend membrane was quaternized by p-chloromethyl styrene (p-CMS), and the double bonds were introduced onto the membrane surface, which further participated in the polymerization of zwitterionic monomers on the membrane surface. The results indicated that the resultant membrane exhibited obviously improved hydrophilicity and weak positive charge (isoelectric point, 7.49). The membrane presented higher flux recovery ratio and lower protein adhesion compared with the pure PVDF membrane. Meanwhile, the membrane showed high-efficiency broad-spectrum antibacterial performance, that is, the bacteria killing efficiency of S. aureus and E. coli reached 98.2% and 97.0%, respectively. Moreover, the membrane effectively inhibited bacterial adhesion, which is important for the long-term antibacterial properties of membrane.

{"title": "Performance Evaluation of a Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Based on Flag-Flutter.", "abstract": "In the last few decades, piezoelectric (PZT) materials have played a vital role in the aerospace industry because of their energy harvesting capability. PZT energy harvesters (PEH) absorb the energy from an operational environment and can transform it into useful energy to drive nano/micro-electronic components. In this research work, a PEH based on the flag-flutter mechanism is presented. This mechanism is based on fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The flag is subjected to the axial airflow in the subsonic wind tunnel. The performance evaluation of the harvester and aeroelastic analysis is investigated numerically and experimentally. A novel solution is presented to extract energy from Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) phenomenon by means of PZT transduction. The PZT patch absorbs the flow-induced structural vibrations and transforms it into electrical energy. Furthermore, the optimal resistance and length of the flag is predicted to maximize the energy harvesting. Different configurations of flag i.e., with Aluminium (Al) patch and PZT patch for flutter mode vibration mode are studied numerically and experimentally. The bifurcation diagram is constructed for the experimental campaign for the flutter instability of a cantilevered flag in subsonic wind-tunnel. Moreover, the flutter boundary conditions are analysed for reduced critical velocity and frequency. The designed PZT energy harvester via flag-flutter mechanism is suitable for energy harvesting in aerospace engineering applications to drive wireless sensors. The maximum output power that can be generated from the designed harvester is 6.72 mW and the optimal resistance is predicted to be 0.33 M\u03a9.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-10-18", "authors": ["HassanElahi", "MarcoEugeni", "FedericoFune", "LucaLampani", "FrancoMastroddi", "GiovanniPaolo Romano", "PaoloGaudenzi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11100933\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.02.023\n10.1007/s00542-020-05017-y\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.06.011\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.05.022\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.09.046\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.028\n10.1007/s00542-018-3856-8\n10.1063/1.5126476\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.034\n10.1007/s12206-016-0715-3\n10.1007/s00542-018-3994-z\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/7/075024\n10.1006/jfls.2001.0435\n10.1006/jfls.1995.1007\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2011.04.008\n10.1017/S0022112003004294\n10.1126/science.1088295\n10.1073/pnas.0408383102\n10.1017/S0022112009007770\n10.1017/S0022112008003297\n10.1017/S0022112008004321\n10.1017/S0962492902000077\n10.1063/1.2734674\n10.1103/PhysRevE.81.056304\n10.1143/JPSJ.24.392\n10.1038/35048530\n10.1016/S0889-9746(02)00121-4\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.03.042\n10.1016/j.ast.2019.04.031\n10.3390/en11071850\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2015.10.006\n10.1177/1045389X09345557\n10.1023/B:NODY.0000045544.96418.bf\n10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.12.044\n10.1016/j.ast.2019.105634"}

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the residual thermal stress of lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric fiber aluminum (Al) matrix (piezoelectric fiber/Al) composites generated during fabrication and to understand the effect of the residual thermal stress on the electromechanical response. The three-dimensional finite element method was employed, and the residual stress generated during the solidification process of the Al matrix was calculated. The output voltage was also calculated in the analysis when putting stresses on the composite materials in the length direction of the piezoelectric fiber. It was shown that the cooling from higher temperatures increases the electromechanical conversion capability. Furthermore, we also performed the simulation, and we recorded the output voltage under concentrated load to investigate its application as a load position detection sensor, and we also discussed the influence of the position by changing the modeling with a different fiber position in the Al. The residual stress of hot press molded piezoelectric fiber/Al composite was then measured, and the comparison was made with the calculated values. The simulation results revealed that our model predictions reproduced and explained the experimental observations of curing residual stress.

Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in the environment worldwide. Diclofenac is transformed by UVA light into different products with higher toxicity. The absorbance of the transformation products overlaps with the absorbance of diclofenac itself and inhibits the ongoing photoreaction. By adding polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), the products adsorb to the surface of PVDF. Therefore, phototransformation of diclofenac and total organic carbon (TOC) removal is enhanced and the toxicity decreased. At 15 min and 18 h of UVA treatment, removal of diclofenac and TOC increases from 56% to 65% and 18% to 54%, respectively, when PVDF is present. The toxicity of a UVA treated (18 h) diclofenac solution doubles (from 5 to 10, expressed in toxicity units, TU), while no toxicity was detectable when PVDF is present during UVA treatment (TU = 0).

{"title": "Dynamic Response of PVDF Cantilever Due to Droplet Impact Using an Electromechanical Model.", "abstract": "The dynamic response of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) cantilever beam under excitation of water droplet impact is investigated by developing an electromechanical model. In the model, the governing equations of beam motion and output voltage are derived in the theoretical way, such that the voltage across the PVDF layer and the cantilever deflection can be predicted. The motion of the beam is described by the multi-mode vibration model through which more accurate results can be obtained. The predicted results of the model are validated by the experiment. Combined with the experiment and the model, the effect of surface wettability on droplet-substrate interaction mechanisms is investigated, which provides an insight into the improvement of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency in raindrop energy harvesting (REH) applications. Results show: (1) the droplet splash on a super-hydrophobic beam surface has a positive effect on voltage generation. The splash limit that affects the reaction force of the impacting droplet is experimentally determined and greatly dominant by the Weber number. (2) Small-scaled droplets in splash regime allow generating higher voltage output from a super-hydrophobic beam surface than from an untreated hydrophilic beam surface. (3) Tests of successive droplet impacts also show that a super-hydrophobic surface performs better over a hydrophilic surface by producing constant peak voltage and higher electrical energy harvested. In this case, the voltage measured from the hydrophilic surface decreases gradually as the water layer is accumulated. Overall, the electromechanical behaviors of a super-hydrophobic PVDF cantilever sensor can be well predicted by the model which shows a great potential in energy harvesting by maximizing the inelastic collision upon droplet-substrate interactions.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-10-16", "authors": ["GuannanHao", "XiangweiDong", "ZengliangLi", "XiaoxiaoLiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s20205764\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/01/015039\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/01/015038\n10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.097\n10.3390/s19173653\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.035\n10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.071\n10.1007/s11664-016-5201-2\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055019\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab2db2\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.03.022\n10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.114\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.705.247\n10.1109/scored.2017.8305370\n10.1109/TIA.2017.2752132\n10.1177/1045389X16649702\n10.1177/0954406217722804\n10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.015\n10.1007/s11664-016-5252-4\n10.1016/0301-9322(94)00069-V\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.1177/1045389X07085639\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2004.00120.x\n10.1177/1045389X14549871\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1039/C4SM00513A\n10.1016/S0341-8162(81)80006-9\n10.1006/jcis.1998.5518"}

{"title": "Design and optimization of a hybrid process based on hollow-fiber membrane/coagulation for wastewater treatment.", "abstract": "Treatment of textile wastewater using ultrafiltration membranes was carried out in this study. Since membrane fouling is a major operational problem that decreases the membrane separation efficiency, wastewater was treated with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and alum (aluminum sulfate) as coagulant to decrease the fouling of ultrafiltration membranes. PACl was selected as the best coagulant in the experiments. Also, chitosan was used as coagulant aid upon developing the hybrid process. The obtained optimum dosage of PACl coagulant was 100\u00a0mg/L, and maximum turbidity and COD removal of 35% and 66% were attained, respectively. The pretreated wastewater by coagulation was sent to ultrafiltration process for further removal of turbidity and COD. Three ultrafiltration hollow-fiber membranes made of polypropylene (PP), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polyethersulfone (PES) were applied in this study. In general, the filtration results were evaluated for two types of samples treated under coagulation and without treatment; the results were unfavorable for the second type. The effects of transmembrane pressure (TMP) and cross velocity on membranes performance were also investigated for process optimization. The obtained results showed that PVDF membrane had the highest flux and turbidity removal, whereas the PES membrane had the highest COD removal.

The ultrasonic longitudinal critically refracted (LCR) wave is sensitive to stress and can measure stress at different depths, which has a prominent advantage in stress non-destructive measurements. In order to accurately characterize the propagation depth of LCR waves and improve the spatial resolution of stress measurement, a finite element model suitable for the study of LCR wave propagation depths was established based on a wave equation and Snell law, and the generation and propagation process of LCR waves are analyzed. By analyzing the blocking effect of grooves with different depths on the wave, the propagation depth of the LCR wave at seven specific frequencies was determined in turn. On this basis, the LCR wave propagation depth model is established, and the effects of wedge materials, piezoelectric element diameters, and excitation voltages on the propagation depth of LCR waves are discussed. This study is of great significance to improve the spatial resolution of stress measurements at different depths in the end face of the aero-engine rotor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-10-15", "authors": ["YongmengLiu", "EnxiaoLiu", "YuanlinChen", "XiaomingWang", "ChuanzhiSun", "JiubinTan"], "doi": "10.3390/s20195724\n10.1016/j.ast.2017.10.003\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2017.05.003\n10.3390/s151026997\n10.1016/j.ijpvp.2010.07.001\n10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106164\n10.1016/j.matdes.2012.11.023\n10.1016/j.ultras.2011.11.004\n10.1016/j.msea.2019.138093\n10.3390/s20113267\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.08.013\n10.3390/s18082603\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.09.005\n10.1016/j.actamat.2010.04.010\n10.1016/j.ijpvp.2007.10.007\n10.1177/0954406215619648\n10.3390/s19030492\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.04.003\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.03.022\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.03.014\n10.1007/s11340-009-9283-0\n10.1016/j.matdes.2013.02.050\n10.1016/j.matdes.2013.06.032\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.03.004\n10.1016/S0963-8695(98)00046-2\n10.3233/JAE-2010-1223\n10.1115/1.4023432"}

{"title": "Flexible, Strong, Multifunctional Graphene Oxide/Silica-Based Composite Aerogels via a Double-Cross-Linked Network Approach.", "abstract": "Multifunctional silica-based aerogels are an emerging material due to their unique properties and wide applications. However, their large-scale production and application are limited due to the high cost and cumbersome preparation process. Herein, we prepare graphene oxide (GO)/silica-based composite aerogels via a simple in situ sol-gel reaction. GO nanosheets (GOs) are functionalized with polyethylenimine (PEI) and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) successively. After a cohydrolysis and condensation of trimethoxymethylsilane (MTMS) and dimethoxydimethylsilane (DMDMS) in the presence of GOs and a convenient ambient-pressure drying process, the composite aerogels are obtained. In addition to the normal cross-linking of MTMS and DMDMS, the GOs also behave as cross-linking points to significantly enhance the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the network of the composite aerogels. The pore structure of the aerogels is tailored by varying the GO loads as well as its surface modification. The Young's modulus of a composite aerogel with a GO load of 0.5 wt % is about 5 times that for a neat polysiloxane aerogel, and the maximum degradation rate temperature is increased to over 90 \u00b0C. Compared with pure polysiloxane aerogel, the thermal insulation and flame resistance are also improved by a small addition of GOs. Moreover, GO/silica-based composite aerogels show stable piezo-resistive behavior. With the excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and multifunctionality, GO/silica-based composite aerogels show promising applications under some harsh and extreme conditions.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-10-14", "authors": ["ZhengZheng", "YongliangZhao", "JianhuaHu", "HaitaoWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c14333"}

{"title": "Selective Retreatment and Sinus Lift: An Alternative Approach to Surgically Manage the Palatal Roots of Maxillary Molars.", "abstract": "Endodontic microsurgery on the palatal root of maxillary molars presents a clinical challenge because of the root position and approximation from the maxillary sinus floor. Attempting a buccal or a palatal approach to address the root is associated with limited accessibility and visibility as well as the risk of injury to the maxillary sinus membrane and/or the greater palatine nerves and vessels. If all the maxillary molar roots require surgical intervention, two flaps may even be needed, which can make the procedure technically more difficult and lengthier. This case report presents 2 clinical cases in which apicoectomy was needed on the palatal roots of maxillary molars. The treatment includes selective nonsurgical retreatment of the palatal root and obturation using a root repair material followed by a surgical intervention from a buccal approach to treat the buccal roots, sinus lift using piezosurgery, and root resection of the palatal root. The approach was successful in both cases without any untoward events. We monitored the radiographic changes using cone-beam computed tomographic imaging immediately after the surgery and at multiple follow-up appointments. The cone-beam computed tomographic images revealed healing of the periapical disease around all the roots up to 14 and 24 months and apical repositioning of the maxillary sinus floor.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2020-10-13", "authors": ["Adham AAzim", "Howard HWang", "MaksimSerebro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2020.08.028"}

{"title": "Ultra-High-Speed Western Blot using Immunoreaction Enhancing Technology.", "abstract": "A western blot (also known as an immunoblot) is a canonical method for biomedical research. It is commonly used to determine the relative size and abundance of specific proteins as well as post-translational protein modifications. This technique has a rich history and remains in widespread use due to its simplicity. However, the western blotting procedure famously takes hours, even days, to complete, with a critical bottleneck being the long incubation times that limit its throughput. These incubation steps are required due to the slow diffusion of antibodies from the bulk solution to the immobilized antigens on the membrane: the antibody concentration near the membrane is much lower than the bulk concentration. Here, we present an innovation that dramatically reduces these incubation intervals by improving antigen binding via cyclic draining and replenishing (CDR) of the antibody solution. We also utilized an immunoreaction enhancing technology to preserve the sensitivity of the assay. A combination of the CDR method with a commercial immunoreaction enhancing agent boosted the output signal and substantially reduced the antibody incubation time.

{"title": "Uncovering the Chemistry of Cross-Linked Polymer Binders via Chemical Bonds for Silicon-Based Electrodes.", "abstract": "Great efforts have been devoted to the development of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as electric cars, large-scale energy storage, and portable electronic devices. To this end, silicon-based electrodes have been increasingly regarded as promising electrode materials by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low costs, environmental friendliness, and high natural abundance. It has been noted that during repeated cycling, severe challenges such as huge volume change remain to be solved prior to practical application, which boosts the development of advanced cross-linked binders via chemical bonds (CBCBs) beyond traditional PVDF binder. This is because CBCBs can effectively fix the electrode particles, inhibit the volume expansion of Si particles, and stabilize the solid electrolyte interface and thus can enable good cycling stability of silicon anode-based batteries. In light of these merits, CBCBs hence arouse much attention from both industry and academia. In this review, we present chemical/mechanical characteristics of CBCBs and systematically discuss the recent advancements of cross-linked binders via chemical bonding for silicon-based electrodes. Focus is placed on the cross-linking chemistries, construction methods and structure-performance relationships of CBCBs. Finally, the future development and performance optimization of CBCBs are proposed. This discussion will provide good insight into the structural design of CBCBs for silicon-based electrodes.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-10-13", "authors": ["ZhouChen", "HuanruiZhang", "TiantianDong", "PengzhouMu", "XianchaoRong", "ZhongtaoLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c12519"}

Current calculations include short-range e-ph interactions (obtained by interpolation) and the dipolelike Fr\u00f6lich long-range coupling in polar materials, but lack important quadrupole effects for acoustic modes and PE materials.

In this article, CNTs have been introduced to high-strength epoxy adhesive for enabling in-situ strain sensing in adhesively bonded aluminium-to-aluminium single-lap joints to accurately indicate the onset and propagation of adhesion failure to the evolution of piezo-resistivity in varying mechanical loads. The CNT modified adhesive in bonded joints and the CNT modified adhesive alone have been tested under monothonic and cyclic tensile loads up to ultimate failure. The changes in the piezo-resistivity induced by the CNTs have been monitored in situ with respect to loading. A novel interpretation method has been developed for progressive, instantaneous adhesion failure estimation under cyclic tensile stresses from a resistivity baseline. The method indicates that the in-situ resistivity changes and the rate of the changes with strain, i.e. sensitivity, strongly correlate with the adhesion failure progression, irrespective of the CNT dispersion quality. Moreover, the effect of bond thickness on the evolution of piezo-resistivity and adhesion failure have been studied. It was observed that relatively thin adhesive bonds (0.18\u00a0mm thickness), possessing higher CNT contact points than thick bonds (0.43\u00a0mm thickness), provide 100 times higher sensitivity to varying cyclic loads.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-10-10", "authors": ["TadejBregar", "DonglanAn", "SomayehGharavian", "MarekBurda", "IsidroDurazo-Cardenas", "Vijay KumarThakur", "DavidAyre", "MarcinS\u0142oma", "MarkHardiman", "ConorMcCarthy", "HamedYazdani Nezhad"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-74076-y\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.01.020\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.09.046\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.09.045\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.03.033\n10.1016/j.procir.2016.09.021\n10.1243/0954410971532703\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.10.009\n10.1109/tii.2018.2878758\n10.1016/j.infrared.2019.02.002\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2018.10.005\n10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.103\n10.1080/13588265.2014.963378\n10.1021/acsomega.8b00940\n10.1002/adma.200600977\n10.1016/j.carbon.2009.01.030\n10.1002/adfm.200800865\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2009.03.010\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.01.001\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2016.11.027\n10.1016/j.carbon.2009.03.039\n10.3390/s140917304\n10.1016/s0032-3861(99)00890-3\n10.1016/s1359-835x(00)00163-9\n10.1016/s0266-3538(01)00094-x\n10.1002/pen.760230109\n10.1002/pen.760330605\n10.1021/la401264r\n10.1103/RevModPhys.45.574\n10.1007/bf00540785\n10.1007/s10853-007-1688-5\n10.1103/PhysRevB.58.R7492\n10.1557/mrs2007.234\n10.1002/adfm.200700065\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.05.006\n10.1016/j.polymer.2004.11.081\n10.1016/s0032-3861(03)00539-1\n10.1038/nature04969\n10.1016/j.matlet.2010.07.001\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.06.018\n10.3390/s111110691\n10.1038/35015519\n10.1139/v09-173\n10.1080/20550324.2015.1113639\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.154\n10.1038/381384a0\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/3/009\n10.1016/j.actamat.2008.02.030\n10.1016/j.carbon.2009.10.012\n10.1177/0021998310393296\n10.1163/092430410x490446\n10.1088/0957-4484/15/3/026\n10.1039/c6ra03619h\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.07.003\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.017\n10.1177/1475921716655498\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.05.016\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.06.013\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.11.004"}

A combination of physical and chemical (total solids, protein, phosphorus, ammonia, chemical oxygen demand) methods, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and Live/Dead viability assay) and genetic sequencing over a period of 81 days was used to provide an in-depth understanding of the impact of different polymer materials on biofilm formation, bacteria population, and wastewater treatment performance. The results showed that hydrophobic polymeric materials (i.e., PP and PVDF) promoted initial cell adhesion and biofilm formation (<16 days) better than the hydrophilic (i.e., ABS and HDPE) polymeric materials. However, under longer-term and steady-state operation (after 81 days), the hydrophilic materials demonstrated larger mature biofilm quantities and better wastewater treatment performance. The sequencing data showed biofilm bacterial community structures of the ABS and HDPE to be significantly different compared to the other polymeric materials tested. The data showed a positive correlation as well between the phyla present on the ABS and HDPE and COD removal.

Recent studies support the hypothesis that these compositional and mechanical changes create a progressive feed-forward loop in which enhanced matrix deposition and tissue stiffening contribute to fibroblast and myofibroblast differentiation and activation, which further perpetuates matrix production and stiffening. The biomechanical properties of tissues are sensed and responded to by mechanotransduction pathways that facilitate sensing of changes in mechanical cues by tissue resident cells and convert the mechanical signals into downstream biochemical signals. Although our understanding of mechanotransduction pathways associated with pulmonary fibrosis remains incomplete, recent progress has allowed us to begin to elucidate the specific mechanisms supporting fibrotic feed-forward loops. The mechanosensors discussed here include integrins, Piezo channels, transient receptor potential channels, and nonselective ion channels.

{"title": "Novel treatment of revision malarplasty with piezosurgery: A case report.", "abstract": "Reduction malarplasty is a routine clinical procedure among Asian women, but the traditional surgical methods are still associated with serious complications, such as nonunion of the osteotomy sites. Revisional surgery to correct such complications is common, but poor bone healing in the osteotomy area presents a challenge to plastic surgeons. In this report, the authors present a new technique for revision malarplasty that uses the piezosurgery (piezoelectric bone surgery) approach.\nA 30-year-old female patient underwent reduction malarplasty with titanium plate fixation in the zygomatic region at another hospital 4 years ago, but the root of the zygomatic arch was not fixed. The patient was diagnosed with bone nonunion, facial asymmetry, and soft tissue sagging on the right side of the face after malarplasty.\nWe used piezosurgery to truncate the displaced healed broken end of the zygomatic bone according to the original osteotomy line. Following this, the malar was re-fixed with micro-titanium mesh, and the zygomatic arch was fixed with a titanium plate.\nThe patient was followed up for 11 months after the revision procedure. Her facial appearance was satisfactory, and no complications were observed on computed tomography images.\nThis report presents a novel therapeutic option for surgical revision of failed malarplasty. Piezosurgery can help overcome the limitations of traditional surgical methods by reducing bone resorption, preventing resorption of the bone in revision malarplasty, modifying the degree of inward and upward movement of the zygomatic bone by facilitating adjustment of the position of the drill hole in the cortex of the bone stump for stable fixation.

Because prior work showed that the force of shear stress activates sphingomyelinase in endothelium, we considered if sphingomyelinase is relevant to endogenous PIEZO1. Patch clamping was used to quantify PIEZO1-mediated signals in freshly isolated murine endothelium exposed to the mechanical forces caused by shear stress and membrane stretch. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors and genetic disruption of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) cause PIEZO1 to switch to profoundly inactivating behavior. Ceramide (a key product of SMPD3) rescues non-inactivating channel behavior. Its co-product, phosphoryl choline, has no effect. In contrast to ceramide, sphingomyelin (the SMPD3 substrate) does not affect inactivation but alters channel force sensitivity.

{"title": "Converting lateral scanning into axial focusing to speed up three-dimensional microscopy.", "abstract": "In optical microscopy, the slow axial scanning rate of the objective or the sample has traditionally limited the speed of volumetric imaging. Recently, by conjugating either a movable mirror to the image plane in a remote-focusing geometry or an electrically tuneable lens (ETL) to the back focal plane, rapid axial scanning has been achieved. However, mechanical actuation of a mirror limits the axial scanning rate (usually only 10-100\u2009Hz for piezoelectric or voice coil-based actuators), while ETLs introduce spherical and higher-order aberrations that prevent high-resolution imaging. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel optical design that transforms a lateral-scan motion into a spherical aberration-free axial scan that can be used for high-resolution imaging. Using a galvanometric mirror, we scan a laser beam laterally in a remote-focusing arm, which is then back-reflected from different heights of a mirror in the image space. We characterize the optical performance of this remote-focusing technique and use it to accelerate axially swept light-sheet microscopy by an order of magnitude, allowing the quantification of rapid vesicular dynamics in three dimensions.

A tactile stiffness sensor based on piezoelectric vibration is designed to detect tissue stiffness just by gentle contacting, without the risk of injuring the organ. A novel multi-tumor detection method is proposed to solve the problem that existing tumor detection methods can only detect a single tumor. In addition, the moving distance of the sensor during palpation is introduced into the sampling strategy function as a new factor, so that the total moving distance of sensor can be considered and optimized during the tumor palpation process. Simulation studies are carried out to compare the new method with existing methods in tumor detection. It shows that the proposed method can identify and locate multiple tumors successfully with the highest performance (F1 score > 0.99), and the total moving distance during palpation is reduced by 43% without any compromise in the detection accuracy.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The bilayer transducer consists of a fractal piezoelectric membrane and pH-sensitive chemo-mechanical hydrogel, which overcomes many shortcomings in the chemical and biochemical sensing. The fractal design on the piezoelectric membrane enhances frequency response and linearity by employing periodically repeated pore architecture. As a basis of the pore, a Hilbert space-filling curve with modifications is used. On the surface of the fractal piezoelectric membrane, the hydrogel is laminated. When the bilayer transducer is introduced to a pH environment (e.g., pH = 4, 8, and 12), the hydrogel swells (or shrinks) and induces the curling of the bilayer transducer (10.47\u00b0/pH). The curvature then exhibits various ultrasound responses when the bilayer transducer was excited.

The transformation is fully reversible and could enhance the piezoelectric coefficient d_{33}. Further free energy calculations illustrate that such a polarization \"decomposition\" process occurs within the region on the Landau free energy curve with respect to the polarization direction where the second derivative becomes negative, which is similar to spinodal instability in phase transformations such as spinodal ordering or isostructural phase separation (e.g., spinodal decomposition).

Cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) revealed the position of the palatal root of the first molar within the maxillary sinus. The case highlights the management of the palatal root and the handling of a perforation of the Schneiderian membrane through a combination of piezosurgery and a sinus lift grafting procedure involving a second-generation of platelet concentrates. No postoperative complications were observed. Sinus bone augmentation after a 26-month recall period was confirmed by CBCT in the clinically asymptomatic teeth.\nThe selective bone tissue cutting and enhanced visibility obtained by piezoelectric surgery in comparison with current rotary techniques make this technology the preferred tool for apical surgery when the mucosal lining of the maxillary sinus could be compromised. The wound healing and physical properties of the platelet-rich fibrin membranes in combination with an allograft material can be considered as sinus bone graft options when a transantral approach is performed on a palatal root of a maxillary molar.

Here, we propose an approach to manipulate the damping by using the large damping enhancement induced by the two-magnon scattering and a nonlocal spin relaxation process in which spin currents are resonantly transported from antiferromagnetic domains to ferromagnetic matrix in a mixed-phased metallic alloy FeRh. This damping enhancement in FeRh is sensitive to its fraction of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which can be dynamically tuned by electric fields through a strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling. In a heterostructure of FeRh and piezoelectric PMN-PT, we demonstrated a more than 120% modulation of the effective damping by electric fields during the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.

{"title": "Study in circular auxetic structures for efficiency enhancement in piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric (PZT) components are one of the most popular elements in vibration sensing and also energy harvesting. They are very well established, cost effective and available in different geometries however there are still several challenges in their application particularly in vibration energy harvesting. They are normally narrow-band elements and work in high-frequency range. Their efficiency and power extraction density are also generally low compared with different electromagnetic techniques. Auxetic structures are proposed here to enhance efficiency of the piezoelectric circular patches in vibration energy harvesting. These kinds of patches namely PZT buzzers are inexpensive (less than 10 USD) elements and easily available. Two novel circular auxetic substrates are proposed to improve power extraction capacity of the conventional piezoelectric buzzers. Negative Poison's ratio of the proposed meta-structure helps in efficiency enhancement. The concept is introduced, analyzed and verified through the finite element modeling and experimental testing. The idea is proved to work by comparing the harvested electrical power in the auxetic design against the conventional plain system. A parametric study is then carried out and effects of important electrical and geometrical parameters as well as the material property on the power extraction efficiency are assessed to arrive at optimum parameters. It is shown that by employing the auxetic design, a remarkable improvement in the harvested power is achievable. It is shown that for the two proposed auxetic designs, at the resonance frequency, we could reach to 10.2 and 13.3 magnification factor with respect to the plain energy harvester. Another important feature is that the resonant frequency in these new designs is very much lower than the conventional resonators. Results of this study can open a new path to application of inexpensive PZT buzzers in large-scale vibration energy harvesting.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-10-03", "authors": ["PejmanEghbali", "DavoodYounesian", "ArminMoayedizadeh", "MostafaRanjbar"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-73425-1\n10.1038/s41928-018-0189-7\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.068\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114710\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.080\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.036\n10.1038/s41467-018-03103-4\n10.1038/nchem.1145\n10.1016/j.joule.2019.12.019\n10.1038/s41467-018-03029-x\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.11.014\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.019\n10.1016/j.jsv.2018.02.041\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114191\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.032\n10.1038/s41467-019-10061-y\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111634\n10.1038/nnano.2008.314\n10.1038/s41598-017-17765-5\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112105\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106824\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.05.027\n10.1021/am5085379\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.043\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2387882\n10.1038/353124a0\n10.1021/acsami.9b06081\n10.1007/s00707-019-02437-4\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2016.09.006\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/054012\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.05.033\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.10.077\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115217\n10.1002/er.5010\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.09.019\n10.1002/adfm.201606695\n10.1002/9781119991151\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.257\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.06.007\n10.1016/j.mejo.2010.10.007\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.082\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.06.029"}

{"title": "Actuating Voltage Waveform Optimization of Piezoelectric Inkjet Printhead for Suppression of Residual Vibrations.", "abstract": "After a piezoelectric inkjet printhead jets the first droplet, the actuating membrane still vibrates, creating residual vibrations in the ink channel, which can degrade the inkjet printhead performance. For suppressing these vibrations, an optimized actuating voltage waveform with two pulses must be obtained, of which the first pulse is used for jetting and the second pulse is used to suppress the residual vibrations. In this study, the pressure history within the ink channel of a recirculating piezoelectric inkjet printhead was first acquired using lumped element modeling. Then, for suppressing residual vibrations, a bipolar voltage waveform was optimized via analysis of the tuning time (tt), dwell time (td2), rising time (tr2), falling time (tf2), and voltage amplitude of the second pulse. Two voltage waveforms, Waveform 01 and Waveform 02, were optimized thereafter. In Waveform 01, tt=2\u00a0\u03bcs,\u00a0td2=2\u00a0\u03bcs, and tr2 and tf2=1\u00a0\u03bcswere finalized as the optimal parameters; in the case of another waveform, the optimal parameters of td2, tr2, and tf2 were found to be 4, 1, and 1\u00a0\u03bcs, respectively. The optimal voltage amplitude of the second pulse was found to be 1/3 the amplitude of the first pulse. On the basis of our analysis, the tuning time in Waveform 01 is the most sensitive parameter, and the performance yielded is even poorer than that yielded by standard waveform, if not optimized. Therefore, the other waveform is recommended for the suppression of residual vibrations.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-10-03", "authors": ["Muhammad AliShah", "Duck-GyuLee", "Bo YeonLee", "Nam WoonKim", "HyojinAn", "ShinHur"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11100900\n10.3390/mi11020117\n10.1126/sciadv.aat1659\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111552\n10.1016/j.microrel.2004.12.009\n10.18063/ijb.v5i1.172\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-19\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.024501\n10.1038/s41467-020-18103-6\n10.3182/20110828-6-IT-1002.01129\n10.1016/j.conengprac.2011.02.007\n10.13189/ujme.2019.071503\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.10.010\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.06.010\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2026465\n10.1115/1.1924627\n10.1147/rd.283.0314\n10.1007/s00542-017-3301-4\n10.1147/rd.311.0096\n10.1016/j.physrep.2010.03.003\n10.1007/s11630-013-0588-z\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.02.009\n10.3390/mi10110757\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.11.001\n10.2352/ISSN.2169-4451.2019.35.173\n10.2352/ISSN.2169-4451.2019.35.89\n10.2514/1.19855\n10.1109/TEPM.2002.1000480\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa7040\n10.1063/1.1427441"}

{"title": "Electroblotting through a tryptic membrane for LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins separated in electrophoretic gels.", "abstract": "Digestion of proteins separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) remains a popular method for protein identification using mass-spectrometry based proteomics. Although robust and routine, the in-gel digestion procedure is laborious and time-consuming. Electroblotting to a capture membrane prior to digestion reduces preparation steps but requires on-membrane digestion that yields fewer peptides than in-gel digestion. This paper develops direct electroblotting through a trypsin-containing membrane to a capture membrane to simplify extraction and digestion of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identifies the extracted peptides. Analysis of peptides from different capture membrane pieces shows that electrodigestion does not greatly disturb the spatial resolution of a standard protein mixture separated by SDS-PAGE. Electrodigestion of an Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell lysate requires four hours of total sample preparation and results in only 13% fewer protein identifications than in-gel digestion, which can take 24 h. Compared to simple electroblotting and protein digestion on a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) capture membrane, adding a trypsin membrane to the electroblot increases the number of protein identifications by 22%.

{"title": "[Dorsal preservation septorhinoplasty].", "abstract": "Nasal dorsum deprojection is a\u00a0very important tool in functional and aesthetic rhinoplasty. In classic techniques, resection of dorsal bone and cartilage renders dorsal reconstruction necessary. The concept of dorsal preservation rhinoplasty has been known for more than a\u00a0century but has experienced a\u00a0renaissance in recent years, with many critical technical modifications.\nWe present the latest technique of piezo-assisted dorsal preservation rhinoplasty with subdorsal triangular resection and subdorsal Cottle modification based on clinical experience of 205\u00a0cases. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of this technique are discussed and several other current variations are presented.\nPiezo-assisted osteotomy enables a\u00a0very precise fracture line and sparing of periosteum, with bone sculpting possible even after mobilization. Subdorsal septal height reduction always precedes completion of the osteotomy and nasal bone mobilization, to ensure patient safety with regard to skull base injury. Using the presented technical modifications, the risk of step deformities in the radix is minimized. In selected patients, dorsal preservation septorhinoplasty enables the surgeon to perform very conservative and precise deprojection of the nose with excellent outcomes, although the spectrum of possible complications is shifted in comparison to classic techniques.\nThe preliminary experience of 205\u00a0cases with a\u00a0revision rate of less than 10% is promising. A\u00a0final evaluation of the technique will only be possible after further studies and evaluation of long-term results.\nHINTERGRUND: In der \u00e4sthetischen und funktionellen Nasenchirurgie ist die H\u00f6henreduzierung des Nasenr\u00fcckens ein wichtiges Werkzeug.

Das Konzept der nasenr\u00fcckenerhaltenden oder Dorsal-Preservation(DP)-Rhinoplastik ist seit mehr als 100\u00a0Jahren bekannt, aber hat erst in den letzten Jahren eine Renaissance mit vielen technischen Verfeinerungen erfahren.\nWir pr\u00e4sentieren die Technik der piezoassistierten Dorsal-Preservation-Rhinoplastik mit der subdorsalen triangul\u00e4ren Resektion sowie der subdorsalen Cottle-Modifikation anhand der klinischen Erfahrung von 205\u00a0F\u00e4llen. Zudem werden die Vor- und Nachteile dieser Verfahren diskutiert und weitere aktuelle Variationen der Technik beschrieben.\nDurch das piezoassistierte Verfahren k\u00f6nnen die Osteotomief\u00fchrung und Knochenmodelierung sehr pr\u00e4zise erreicht werden. Die subdorsale septale H\u00f6henreduzierung erfolgt immer vor Komplettierung der Osteotomien, um die Patientensicherheit in Bezug auf die Sch\u00e4delbasis sicherzustellen.

Three types of valves were fabricated to investigate the effect of the valve stiffness on the pump performance and to measure the variation in the flow rate according to the frequency. The flow rate increased with the driving frequency until a certain frequency was reached, and then it started to decrease. The rise in the pressure of the pump was found to increase as the stiffness decreased. The pump performance could be clearly distinguished according to the stiffness of the valve. The observation of the valve movements revealed that the valve opening time did not change regardless of the operating frequency, but it changed with the valve stiffness. The delay in time for the outlet valve increased significantly with an increase in the frequency. It seems that the overlap of the opening time of the inlet valve and the outlet valve plays an important role in pump performance. Therefore, it is advisable to use different designs for the inlet and outlet valves, where the shape and stiffness of the valve are adjusted.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-10-01", "authors": ["JangmiWoo", "Dong KeeSohn", "Han SeoKo"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11100894\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2019.04.009\n10.3390/ijms12063648\n10.1088/2058-7058/18/9/31\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/6/R01\n10.1177/1045389\u00d706072355\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.06.029\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.02.001\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.09.064\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.04.008\n10.1039/C7LC00954B\n10.1063/1.4907982\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.132\n10.3390/s16122108\n10.3390/mi6111452\n10.1299/mer.2014dsm0014\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/5/R01\n10.3390/mi10100653\n10.1016/0250-6874(88)87005-7\n10.1177/1045389X12438628\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2015.06.006\n10.1016/j.advengsoft.2008.04.003\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2018.04.009\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2019.07.008\n10.1115/1.3059565\n10.1016/j.cma.2004.12.005\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2020.103050\n10.1016/j.jcp.2016.02.002\n10.21423/R1808S\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111766\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.002"}

{"title": "Tuning the Structure and Performance of Bulk and Porous Vapor Sensors Based on Co-continuous Carbon Nanotube-Filled Blends of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) and Polycarbonates by Varying Melt Viscosity.", "abstract": "This work describes a new concept of porous vapor sensor materials based on co-continuous polycarbonate/poly(vinylidene fluoride)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PC/PVDF/MWCNT) blend composites. The blend composites were fabricated by melt mixing in a one-step mixing process, and the MWCNT containing component (here PC) was extracted, leaving a MWCNT network on the continuous surface of the remaining component (here PVDF). First, by selecting three PCs with different molecular weights, the blend viscosity ratio and blend fineness and interfacial area were varied. At the chosen blend composition of 40/60 wt %, the desired co-continuous structure was achieved with MWCNTs selectively localized in PC. The conductive polymer composites (CPCs) with low-viscosity PC had the highest conductivity due to a combination of the best MWCNT dispersion and the coarsest blend morphology. The vapor sensing of CPC sensor materials with 1 wt % MWCNT was tested using saturated vapors of dichloromethane, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, and ethyl acetate, showing good interaction with PC.

{"title": "Achieving Flat-on Primary Crystals by Nanoconfined Crystallization in High-Temperature Polycarbonate/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Multilayer Films and Its Effect on Dielectric Insulation.", "abstract": "To meet the stringent requirements of next-generation film capacitors for power electronics, multilayer films (MLFs) are fabricated with the advantage of achieving high temperature rating, high energy density, and reasonably low loss simultaneously. In this study, a high permittivity polar polymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), is multilayered with a linear, low loss dielectric polymer such as high-temperature polycarbonate (HTPC). However, the dielectric loss of these MLFs was still high as compared with current state-of-the-art biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films. The goal of this work is to decrease the dielectric loss and enhance dielectric insulation by achieving flat-on primary PVDF crystals in MLFs via nanoconfined melt-recrystallization. Based on simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments, edge-on lamellar crystals were observed for all as-extruded MLFs, regardless of different PVDF layer thicknesses. However, after melting at 180 \u00b0C followed by recrystallization, flat-on primary crystals were successfully achieved when the PVDF layer thickness was below 39 nm. Above 78 nm for the PVDF layer, major edge-on primary crystals with minor flat-on secondary crystals were observed. From leakage current, breakdown, lifetime, and electric displacement-electric field loop studies, MLFs with the flat-on primary crystals exhibited reduced loss and enhanced dielectric insulation as compared to as-extruded MLFs and those with edge-on primary/flat-on secondary crystals. This was attributed to the effective blockage of charge carriers by the flat-on PVDF primary crystals and their reduced ferroelectric switching.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-09-29", "authors": ["XinyueChen", "QiongLi", "DeepakLanghe", "MichaelPonting", "RuipengLi", "MasafumiFukuto", "EricBaer", "LeiZhu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c15457"}

It is therefore conceivable that changes in tumor extracellular environments affect tumor cell behavior. The Hippo pathway reportedly responds to the extracellular environment and regulates the nuclear localization of the transcription co-activator, yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Inactivation of the Hippo pathway with nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ stimulates cell proliferation.

A 2-channel acoustic emission (AE) system was used to monitor the failure process while the piezo sensors were attached to the rigid stainless-steel jig for recoding the AE events. Load-displacement and AE response were simultaneously monitored until failure of specimens. Parametric AE analysis was conducted for the factors such as amplitude, energy released, signal duration and cumulative counts, for each AE signal. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was conducted to assess the frequency at failure. Linear finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out using commercial software Ansys Workbench 19.1 to present the stress distribution and failure modes. Post-failure surface morphology study was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and statistical analysis was performed using Weibull analysis.\nAll the samples in three different groups have failed at the mid-line, splitting the zirconia crowns into two equal pieces. The load to failure was directly proportional to the cusp angle in crowns; 120\u00b0 group had the highest load-carrying capacity of 2.93 \u00b1 0.26 kN while 60 and 80\u00b0 groups had a failure load of 2.46 \u00b1 0.53 and 2.52 \u00b1 0.16 kN, respectively. Parametric AE analysis revealed that the failure was instantaneous and 60-degree samples had higher AE signature. FE analysis showed the crack initiation at the occlusal surface of the crown which is in agreement with the SEM images.

The best membrane, in terms of proton conductivity, was made by incorporating the sulfonated silica network in PFSA fibers (Type-A) while the lowest conductivity membrane was obtained when sulfonated silica was incorporated into the reinforcing PVDF fibers (Type-B). A Type-A membrane containing 65 wt.% PFSA with an embedded sulfonated silica network (at 15 wt.%) and with 20 wt.% PVDF reinforcing fibers proved superior to the pristine PFSA membrane in terms of both the proton conductivity in the 30-90% RH at 80 \u00b0C (a 25-35% increase) and lateral swelling (a 68% reduction).

Existing methods at mm-wave and submillimeter bands typically suffer from high losses, which are predominantly produced by the inherent limitations of the tuning elements or materials. This report presents a new, ultra-low-loss and phase-tunable, reflection type metasurface design, which outperforms previously reported technologies in terms of phase shifting and loss. The proposed technique utilizes a variable air cavity, formed between a periodic array and a ground plane, which is controlled by means of a piezoelectric actuator. Two metasurface designs are presented and experimentally tested. Firstly, a square patch element metasurface that is capable of achieving a continuous 180\u00b0 phase shift across a wide bandwidth, between 35 and 65\u00a0GHz. Also presented is a double-cross element metasurface that provides full 360\u00b0 phase control between 57 and 62\u00a0GHz. The variable air cavity is controlled by means of a piezoelectric actuator that supports and varies the height of a ground plane, providing highly accurate, millisecond, displacement. Unlike conventional tuning methods, the tuning mechanism, in this case the moving ground plane, introduces no additional sources of loss and enables an average loss performance of 1\u00a0dB.

To overcome those problems, in this paper, we propose a novel passive electromechanical solution for the signal feature extraction in low frequency acoustic range (200-1000 Hz), in the form of a piezoelectric vibration transducer, and a rectifier with a mechanically switched inductor. A simulation study of the novel solution is presented, and a proof-of-concept device is developed and experimentally characterized. We demonstrate its applicability and show the advantages of the passive electromechanical device in comparison to the active electrical solution in terms of operation with lower input signals (<20 mV compared to 40 mV), and higher robustness in low SNR conditions (output voltage loss for -10 dB \u2264 SNR < 40 dB of 1 mV, compared to 10 mV). In addition to the signal processing performance improvements, compared to our previous work, the utilization of the presented novel passive feature extractor would also decrease power consumption of a detector's channel by over 76%, enabling life-time extension and/or increased quality of detection with larger number of channels.

The implant fracture is likely to occur due to increased stress in implant body associated with peri-implant bone resorption.\nThis study aimed to investigate the relationship between degree of peri-implant bone resorption and stress distribution in implant body by using finite element analysis (FEA).\nThe magnitude and direction of loads on implants at the mandibular molar region were measured with 3D piezoelectric force transducers in a patient during maximal voluntary clenching, grinding and tapping to obtain input for the FEA as the loading condition. Simplified finite element bone models were generated to simulate the six patterns of peri-implant bone resorption progression which the bone levels from implant platform were set at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5\u00a0mm. Three types of implants with different diameters (3.5, 4.0 and 5.0\u00a0mm), corresponding abutments and screws were created. FEA using the in vivo measured load was conducted to investigate how peri-implant bone loss affects stress distribution in the implant body.\nLoading condition affected stress distribution in the implant body. As bone resorption increased, von Mises stress in the implant body became larger, which was marked in smaller diameter implants, and this change was amply demonstrated when the bone resorption increased from 0 to 2\u00a0mm.\nThe FEA demonstrated that as peri-implant bone loss increased, the magnitude of stress in the implant increased, especially in small diameter implants.", "journal": "Journal of oral rehabilitation", "date": "2020-09-25", "authors": ["LiuBing", "TakehikoMito", "NobuhiroYoda", "EmikaSato", "RyujiShigemitsu", "Jian-MinHan", "KeiichiSasaki"], "doi": "10.1111/joor.13097"}

These DG-OTFTs are based on a semiconducting/insulating polyblend-based active layer with asymmetric top and bottom charge modulation layers (atb-CMLs). The atb-CMLs are automatically generated through the preparation of multilayer stacks of phase-separated semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):insulating poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) polyblend layer, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) layer, and cross-linked-poly(4-vinylphenol) (cPVP) layer. They consist of a thin PMMA bottom layer and an uneven-shaped PMMA:PVDF miscible mixture-based top layer. The presence of the polarizable insulating PMMA, PVDF, and PMMA:PVDF mixture regions causes the bottom and top CMLs to experience electrical polarization, which induces the dipole field to achieve efficient charge modulation functions in DG-OTFTs. Owing to the presence of atb-CMLs, the DG-OTFTs exhibit unprecedented electrical characteristics, such as the easy depletion of the bottom channel by the top gate potential. However, the top channel can work properly only when given a bottom gate potential (either positive or negative). Given these unusual electrical features, the design of the fundamental dual-mode logic gates (e.g., AND and OR gates) can be achieved with just one DG transistor.

{"title": "Upgraded Kalman Filtering of Cutting Forces in Milling.", "abstract": "Advanced piezoelectric dynamometers with a wide frequency bandwidth are required for cutting force measurement in high-speed milling and micromilling applications. In many applications, the signal bandwidth is limited by the dynamic response of the mechanical system, thus compensation techniques are necessary. The most effective compensation techniques for a full 3D force correction require an accurate and complex identification phase. Extended Kalman filtering is a better alternative for input force estimation in the presence of unknown dynamic disturbances. The maximum bandwidth that can be currently achievable by Kalman filtering is approximately 2 kHz, due to crosstalk disturbances and complex dynamometer's dynamics. In this work, a novel upgraded Kalman filter based on a more general model of dynamometer dynamics is conceived, by also taking into account the influence of the force application point.

In this paper, the generalized mode method is proposed based on the central tendency characteristic of the vortex signal and combined with the existing filter bank method. The method combining filter bank with the generalized mode is designed and applied in the signal-processing system of the vortex flow meter, which makes up for the defect that the filter bank method cannot filter out the noise in the sub-band. The simulation experiments verify the feasibility and anti-interference performance of the algorithm. Meanwhile, a comparison with two FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) spectrum analysis methods shows that the algorithm designed in this paper requires a smaller sample size and achieves better real-time performance.

In this study, we utilized microfluidic technologies to study the shear-induced sensitization of endothelial Piezo-1 to its selective agonist, Yoda-1. We demonstrated that shear stress-induced sensitization is brief and can be impaired when exposing aortic endothelial cells to low and proatherogenic levels of shear stress. Our results suggest that shear stress-induced sensitization of Piezo-1 to Yoda-1 is independent of cell-cell adhesion and is mediated by the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. We also found that shear stress increases the membrane density of Piezo-1 channels in endothelial cells. To further confirm our findings, we performed experiments using a carotid artery ligation mouse model and demonstrated that transient changes in blood-flow pattern, resulting from a high-degree ligation of the mouse carotid artery alters the distribution of Piezo-1 channels across the endothelial layer. These results suggest that shear stress influences the function of Piezo-1 channels via changes in membrane density, providing a new model of shear-stress sensitivity for Piezo-1 ion channel.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["AustinLai", "Yung CChen", "Charles DCox", "AnthonyJaworowski", "KarlheinzPeter", "SaraBaratchi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.30056"}

{"title": "Natural Frequency Response Evaluation for RC Beams Affected by Steel Corrosion Using Acceleration Sensors.", "abstract": "This paper presented a laboratory investigation for analyzing the natural frequency response of reinforced concrete (RC) beams affected by steel corrosion. The electrochemical acceleration technique induced the corroded RC beams until the predetermined value of the steel corrosion ratio was achieved. Then, the natural frequency responses of the corroded beams were tested utilizing piezoelectric acceleration sensors. The damage states of the corroded beams were assessed through the measurement of crack parameters and the equivalent elastic modulus of the beams, which aims to clarify the fundamental characteristics of the dynamic response for the corroded RC beam with the increased steel corrosion ratio. The results revealed that steel corrosion reduces the bending stiffness of the RC beams and, thus, reduces the modal frequency. The variation of natural frequency can identify the corrosion damage even if no surface cracking of the RC beam, and the second-order frequency should be more indicative of the damage scenario. The degradations of stiffness and the natural frequency were estimated in this study by the free vibration equation of a simply supported beam, and a prediction method for the RC beam's residual service life was established. This study supports the use of variations in natural frequency as one diagnostic indicator to evaluate the health of RC bridge structures.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["YuweiZhang", "YongchunCheng", "GuojinTan", "XiangLyu", "XunSun", "YunshuoBai", "ShutingYang"], "doi": "10.3390/s20185335\n10.1080/1478422X.2019.1710660\n10.1016/j.corsci.2012.09.014\n10.1016/j.prostr.2017.07.082\n10.1016/S0167-4730(00)00018-7\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000954\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.10.113\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119162\n10.3390/su10020430\n10.3390/app9081640\n10.1080/10798587.2015.1095486\n10.1155/2020/8312487\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2009.10.036\n10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.022\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/1/015005\n10.1080/15732479.2018.1438479\n10.1007/s12205-009-0423-y\n10.3390/s18124207\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.474\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.08.022\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.08.102\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302849\n10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.469\n10.1179/1432891714Z.000000000585\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.03.103\n10.1016/S0141-0296(01)00005-0\n10.1177/147592170400300401\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.05.067\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1995)121:2(161)\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2013.10.013"}

In the future, these nanogenerators could substitute conventional electrochemical batteries to supply electrical energy to consumer electronics. The optimal design of nanogenerators is fundamental in order to achieve their best electromechanical behavior. We present the analytical electromechanical modeling of a vibration-based piezoelectric nanogenerator composed of a double-clamped beam with five multilayered cross-sections. This nanogenerator design has a central seismic mass (910 \u03bcm thickness) and substrate (125 \u03bcm thickness) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as well as a zinc oxide film (100 nm thickness) at the bottom of each end. The zinc oxide (ZnO) films have two aluminum electrodes (100 nm thickness) through which the generated electrical energy is extracted. The analytical electromechanical modeling is based on the Rayleigh method, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Macaulay method. In addition, finite element method (FEM) models are developed to estimate the electromechanical behavior of the nanogenerator. These FEM models consider air damping at atmospheric pressure and optimum load resistance. The analytical modeling results agree well with respect to those of FEM models.

Superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic membranes are emerging materials for effective oil/water separation. In this paper, superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic polypropylene (PP) melt-blown membranes were prepared through melt-blown and in situ growth method, achieving highly efficient oil/water separation. After in situ growth, polydopamine (PDA) grows on the surface of PP fibers, and the addition of coupling agent (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) can improve the stability of the membrane in harsh environments (1\u00a0M HCl, 1\u00a0M NaOH, 1\u00a0M NaCl). The PDA/APTES@PP membrane could dramatically enhance the wetting (water contact angle \u223c0, underwater oil contact angle\u223c154\u00b0) compare with the pristine PP melt-blown membrane (water contact angle \u223c130\u00b0, underwater oil contact angle \u223c0).

{"title": "Biological cells and coupled electro-mechanical effects: The role of organelles, microtubules, and nonlocal contributions.", "abstract": "Biological cells are exposed to a variety of mechanical loads throughout their life cycles that eventually play an important role in a wide range of cellular processes. The understanding of cell mechanics under the application of external stimuli is important for capturing the nuances of physiological and pathological events. Such critical knowledge will play an increasingly vital role in modern medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, as well as in the development of new remedial treatments. At present, it is well known that the biological molecules exhibit piezoelectric properties that are of great interest for medical applications ranging from sensing to surgery. In the current study, a coupled electro-mechanical model of a biological cell has been developed to better understand the complex behaviour of biological cells subjected to piezoelectric and flexoelectric properties of their constituent organelles under the application of external forces. Importantly, a more accurate modelling paradigm has been presented to capture the nonlocal flexoelectric effect in addition to the linear piezoelectric effect based on the finite element method. Major cellular organelles considered in the developed computational model of the biological cell are the nucleus, mitochondria, microtubules, cell membrane and cytoplasm. The effects of variations in the applied forces on the intrinsic piezoelectric and flexoelectric contributions to the electro-elastic response have been systematically investigated along with accounting for the variation in the coupling coefficients. In addition, the effect of mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton on the electro-elastic response has also been quantified. The present studies suggest that flexoelectricity could be a dominant electro-elastic coupling phenomenon, exhibiting electric fields that are four orders of magnitude higher than those generated by piezoelectric effects alone. Further, the output of the coupled electro-mechanical model is significantly dependent on the variation of flexoelectric coefficients. We have found that the mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton results in the enhancement of both the piezo and flexoelectric responses associated with electro-mechanical coupling. In general, our study provides a framework for more accurate quantification of the mechanical/electrical transduction within the biological cells that can be critical for capturing the complex mechanisms at cellular length scales.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2020-09-23", "authors": ["SundeepSingh", "Jagdish AKrishnaswamy", "RoderickMelnik"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.103859"}

{"title": "Ultrasonic Guided Wave Testing on Cross-Ply Composite Laminate: An Empirical Study.", "abstract": "Structural health monitoring comprises a set of techniques to detect defects appearing in structures. One of the most viable techniques is based on the guided ultrasonic wave test (UGWT), which consists of emitting waves throughout the structure, acquiring the emitted waves with various sensors, and processing the waves to detect changes in the structure. The UGWT of layered composite structures is challenging due to the anisotropic wave propagation characteristics of such structures and to the high signal attenuation that the waves experience. Hence, very low amplitude signals that are hard to distinguish from noise are typically recovered. This paper analyzes the propagation of guided waves along a cross-ply composite laminate following an empirical methodology. The research compares several implementations for UGWT with piezoelectric wafer active sensors. The reference for comparison is set on a basic mode, which considers the application of nominal voltage to a single sensor. The attenuation and spreading of the waves in several directions are compared when more energy is applied to the monitored structure. In addition, delayed multiple emission is also considered in multisensor tests. The goal of all the UGWT configurations is to transmit more energy to the structure such that the echoes of the emission are of greater amplitude and they ease the signal processing.

Reported herein is the preparation of a reinforced superhydrophilic, underwater superoleophobic membrane with demulsification properties using active iron nanoparticles in situ generated on a polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surface. A stable zwitterionic structure is fabricated on the membrane surface and provides it with an excellent capability of binding a hydration layer, leading to enhanced superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic properties. The interaction between the membrane surface and water is quantified using the relaxation time of water. After iron nanoparticles in situ anchoring, the superhydrophilic, underwater superoleophobic PDA/PEI modified PVDF membrane shows more stable flux behaviors, higher oil separation efficiency, demulsification, and excellent antioil-fouling properties for various anionic, nonionic, and cationic surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions in a crossflow filtration system. The reinforced hydration layer and the amphoteric charged demusification properties of the membrane play important roles in enhancing the membrane separation performance. The reinforced membrane also exhibits excellent cleaning and reusability performance in long-term operations.

However, little is known about the influence of working movement on temperature elevation in bone. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of two different working cycles on temperature elevation during piezoelectric implant site preparation. Sixty osteotomies at a depth of 10 mm were performed on bone blocks of bovine ribs using a piezoelectric tip with external irrigation (IM1s, Mectron Medical Technology, Carasco, Italy). A mechanical positioning device was used to guarantee reproducible working and measuring conditions.

{"title": "p-n Heterojunction of BiOI/ZnO nanorod arrays for piezo-photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A in water.", "abstract": "p-n Heterojunctions of BiOI/ZnO nanorod arrays (BiOI/ZnO NRs) were prepared by loading the p-type BiOI nanosheets on the n-type ZnO nanorod arrays for efficient removal of organic contaminants in water during the piezo-photocatalytic degradation. Under concurrent visible-light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration, the bisphenol solution (50 mL, 10 mg/L) could be completely degraded within 30 min by 10 mg of 0.15 BiOI/ZnO NRs. It shows a dramatically-enhanced degradation efficiency under light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration, which is four times as high as that only under light irradiation. The excellent piezo-photocatalytic ability of BiOI/ZnO NRs could be attributed to the piezoelectric effect coupling with photocatalytic process. Under the irradiation of light, the electron-hole pairs were generated in BiOI nanosheets, and the piezoelectric potential is created inside the highly oriented one-dimensional ZnO nanorods by ultrasonic vibration, which can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers. It shows a strategy to effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity through utilizing the internal piezoelectric potential, which is generated by the one-dimensional nanorods with piezoelectric properties under ultrasonic vibration. So, it can promote the separation and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, and result in high-efficient degradation of organic contaminants.", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2020-09-18", "authors": ["ChaojunZhang", "WeihuaFei", "HaoqingWang", "NajunLi", "DongyunChen", "QingfengXu", "HuaLi", "JinghuiHe", "JianmeiLu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123109"}

{"title": "A Review of Piezoelectric PVDF Film by Electrospinning and Its Applications.", "abstract": "With the increase of interest in the application of piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in nanogenerators (NGs), sensors, and microdevices, the most efficient and suitable methods of their synthesis are being pursued. Electrospinning is an effective method to prepare higher content \u03b2-phase PVDF nanofiber films without additional high voltage poling or mechanical stretching, and thus, it is considered an economically viable and relatively simple method. This work discusses the parameters affecting the preparation of the desired phase of the PVDF film with a higher electrical output.

Due to bacterial abhorrence for AgNPs, it is difficult to develop a label-free, sensitive and low-cost bacteria sensor using them. In the present article, we report that an ultrathin and uniform Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) film of AgNPs can be employed for bacteria sensing effectively as compared to that of non-uniform and randomly distributed AgNPs in spin coated film. The uniformly distributed AgNPs in the LS film offer a relatively larger contact surface for bacteria as compared to that of spin coated film. Due to higher contact surface, adsorption of the bacteria on LS film is strongly preferable as compared to that of spin coated film leading to an enhanced sensing performance of the LS film than that of spin coated film. Soil bacteria was grown by the standard protocol and were utilized as model system for bacteria sensing application. The soil bacteria sensing was done by monitoring the piezoresponse and dissipation parameters using a quartz crystal microbalance, simultaneously. Our study indicates that the LS film of AgNPs not only facilitates the adsorption of the soil bacteria but also kills them.", "journal": "Colloids and surfaces.

{"title": "Poly(vinylidene) fluoride membranes coated by heparin/collagen layer-by-layer, smart biomimetic approaches for mesenchymal stem cell culture.", "abstract": "The use of piezoelectric materials in tissue engineering has grown considerably since inherent bone piezoelectricity was discovered. Combinations of piezoelectric polymers with magnetostrictive nanoparticles (MNP) can be used to magnetoelectrically stimulate cells by applying an external magnetic field which deforms the magnetostrictive nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, deforming the polymer itself, which varies the surface charge due to the piezoelectric effect. Poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) is the piezoelectric polymer with the largest piezoelectric coefficients, being a perfect candidate for osteogenic differentiation. As a first approach, in this paper, we propose PVDF membranes containing magnetostrictive nanoparticles and a biomimetic heparin/collagen layer-by-layer (LbL) coating for mesenchymal stem cell culture. PVDF membranes 20% (w/v) with and without cobalt ferrite oxide (PVDF-CFO) 10% (w/w) were produced by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). These membranes were found to be asymmetric, with a smooth surface, crystallinity ranging from 65% to 61%, and an electroactive \u03b2-phase content of 51.8% and 55.6% for PVDF and PVDF-CFO, respectively. Amine groups were grafted onto the membrane surface by an alkali treatment, confirmed by ninhydrin test and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing positive charges for the assembly of heparin/collagen layers by the LbL technique. Five layers of each polyelectrolyte were deposited, ending with collagen. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were used to test cell response in a short-term culture (1, 3 and 7\u00a0days). Nucleus cell counting showed that LbL favored cell proliferation in PVDF-CFO over non-coated membranes.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Genetic variation regulates opioid-induced respiratory depression in mice.", "abstract": "In the U.S., opioid prescription for treatment of pain nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014. The diversion and misuse of prescription opioids along with increased use of drugs like heroin and fentanyl, has led to an epidemic in addiction and overdose deaths. The most common cause of opioid overdose and death is opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), a life-threatening depression in respiratory rate thought to be caused by stimulation of opioid receptors in the inspiratory-generating regions of the brain. Studies in mice have revealed that variation in opiate lethality is associated with strain differences, suggesting that sensitivity to OIRD is genetically determined. We first tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in inbred strains of mice influences the innate variability in opioid-induced responses in respiratory depression, recovery time and survival time. Using the founders of the advanced, high-diversity mouse population, the Diversity Outbred (DO), we found substantial sex and genetic effects on respiratory sensitivity and opiate lethality. We used DO mice treated with morphine to map quantitative trait loci for respiratory depression, recovery time and survival time. Trait mapping and integrative functional genomic analysis in GeneWeaver has allowed us to implicate Galnt11, an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, as a gene that regulates OIRD.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-09-13", "authors": ["Jason ABubier", "HaoHe", "Vivek MPhilip", "TylerRoy", "Christian MonroyHernandez", "RebeccaBernat", "Kevin DDonohue", "Bruce FO'Hara", "Elissa JChesler"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-71804-2\n10.1038/s41380-020-0677-9"}

The simulation results showed that the motion gesture of the inchworm motor was well consistent with that of the actual motor product. The driving force from the simulation was close to that of the actual product, and the maximum error was 2.8%. As for the PIM travel, there was a maximum travel error of 0.6 \u03bcm between the simulation and official data.

However, their continuous operation is often limited by traditional battery technologies with a limited lifespan, creating a significant challenge for their development. Thus, it is highly desirable to harvest biomechanical energies from human motion for self-powered bio-integrated functional devices. Piezoelectric energy harvesters are ideal candidates to achieve this goal by converting biomechanical energy to electric energy. Because of their applications on soft and highly deformable tissues of the human body, these devices also need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable, thus posing a significant challenge. Effective methods to address the challenge include the exploration of new stretchable piezoelectric materials (e.g., hybrid composite material) and stretchable structures (e.g., buckled shapes, serpentine mesh layouts, kirigami designs, among others). This review presents an overview of the recent developments in new intrinsically stretchable piezoelectric materials and rigid inorganic piezoelectric materials with novel stretchable structures for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesters.

Measurement of the bulbar neuromuscular function (e.g., bite force) could be an extension to existing motor scales, sensitive to more nuanced changes, especially in symptomatic patients with severely reduced functional abilities.\nMaximum bite force measurement was used to quantify changes of the masticatory function in adult monozygotic female twins with SMA type II. Using piezoelectric transducers, 550 observations were recorded for each patient during the first year of nusinersen therapy.\nDuring the application of four loading doses of nusinersen, bite force levels steadily increased and reached a statistically significantly higher level compared to the initial state in both patients. Subsequent maintenance doses coincided with smaller or no statistically significant changes in maximum bite force.\nThis pilot study indicates that the measurement of maximum bite force may be a useful tool to detect changes of the bulbar function in SMA patients. As such, it may supplement existing scales to identify treatment-related changes in motor function.", "journal": "Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology", "date": "2020-09-10", "authors": ["TeresaKruse", "RaoulHeller", "BrunhildeWirth", "JuliaGl\u00f6ggler", "Claudia DWurster", "Albert CLudolph", "BertBraumann"], "doi": "10.36185/2532-1900-010\n10.1016/j.nmd.2017.11.005\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90460-3\n10.1086/302369\n10.1016/S0960-8966(06)80015-5\n10.1016/0960-8966(94)00075-K\n10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8\n10.1056/NEJMoa1702752\n10.1056/NEJMoa1710504\n10.1038/nrneurol.2018.4\n10.1097/PEP.0b013e31828a205f\n10.1212/WNL.0000000000002348\n10.1016/S0889-5406(99)70296-9\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.08.016\n10.1016/S1090-3798(03)00060-6\n10.1016/j.nmd.2007.05.009\n10.1016/j.nmd.2009.11.014\n10.1097/PEP.0b013e3182351f04\n10.1046/j.0305-182X.2003.01209.x\n10.1080/01621459.1979.10481038\n10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00645.x\n10.1111/opo.12131\n10.1111/joor.12097\n10.1111/j.1365-2842.2001.00772.x\n10.1002/mus.26771\n10.1111/j.1365-2842.2006.01665.x\n10.11607/ofph.1882\n10.1002/1097-4598(200011)23:11<1694::AID-MUS4>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1177/00220345830620051201\n10.1016/S1350-4533(00)00080-1\n10.1016/S0109-5641(02)00020-9\n10.7860/JCDR/2017/27379.10450\n10.3389/fneur.2020.00139\n10.2169/internalmedicine.8799-16"}

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators.", "journal": "Chemical engineering journal (Lausanne, Switzerland : 1996)", "date": "2020-09-10", "authors": ["S VenkataMohan", "ManupatiHemalatha", "HarishankarKopperi", "IRanjith", "A KiranKumar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cej.2020.126893"}
{"title": "On Nonlinear Bending Study of a Piezo-Flexomagnetic Nanobeam Based on an Analytical-Numerical Solution.", "abstract": "Among various magneto-elastic phenomena, flexomagnetic (FM) coupling can be defined as a dependence between strain gradient and magnetic polarization and, contrariwise, elastic strain and magnetic field gradient. This feature is a higher-order one than piezomagnetic, which is the magnetic response to strain. At the nanoscale, where large strain gradients are expected, the FM effect is significant and could be even dominant. In this article, we develop a model of a simultaneously coupled piezomagnetic-flexomagnetic nanosized Euler-Bernoulli beam and solve the corresponding problems. In order to evaluate the FM on the nanoscale, the well-known nonlocal model of strain gradient (NSGT) is implemented, by which the nanosize beam can be transferred into a continuum framework. To access the equations of nonlinear bending, we use the variational formulation. Converting the nonlinear system of differential equations into algebraic ones makes the solution simpler. This is performed by the Galerkin weighted residual method (GWRM) for three conditions of ends, that is to say clamp, free, and pinned (simply supported). Then, the system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved on the basis of the Newton-Raphson iteration technique (NRT) which brings about numerical values of nonlinear deflections.

Consider the influence of frequency on hysteresis modeling, a rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearity model that is based on Krasnoselskii-Pokrovskii (KP) operator is proposed in this paper. A hybrid optimization algorithm of improved particle swarm optimization and cuckoo search is employed in order to identify the density function of rate-dependent KP model, avoiding the blind search process caused by the high randomness of Levy's flight in the cuckoo search algorithm, and improving the parameter identification performance. For the sake of eliminating the hysteresis characteristics, an inverse feed-forward compensation control that is based on recursive method is proposed without any additional conditions, and a feed-forward compensation controller is designed accordingly.

{"title": "Experimental Investigation on Choosing a Proper Sensor System for Guided Waves to Check the Integrity of Seven-Wire Steel Strands.", "abstract": "Multiple wire twisted steel strands are commonly used to hoist elevators, concrete structures, etc. Due to frequent and long-time usage, the steel strands are subjected to corrosion, overloads, and aging, making strands may fail unexpectedly. Hence, the health monitoring of steel strands becomes more important to avoid the sudden collapse of hoisting structures. Guided waves (GW) inspection methods have become favorable in recent years due to its long-distance transmission and stability of evaluation in the area of structural health monitoring (SHM) and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). Many researchers have reported different GW methods to detect different types of defects that occurred in steel strands. However, researchers rarely carry out comparative studies to investigate the effectiveness of each method or system in monitoring the health state of steel strands.

{"title": "Characteristics Research of a High Sensitivity Piezoelectric MOSFET Acceleration Sensor.", "abstract": "In order to improve the output sensitivity of the piezoelectric acceleration sensor, this paper proposed a high sensitivity acceleration sensor based on a piezoelectric metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). It is constituted by a piezoelectric beam and an N-channel depletion MOSFET. A silicon cantilever beam with Pt/ZnO/Pt/Ti multilayer structure is used as a piezoelectric beam. Based on the piezoelectric effect, the piezoelectric beam generates charges when it is subjected to acceleration. Due to the large input impedance of the MOSFET, the charge generated by the piezoelectric beam can be used as a gate control signal to achieve the purpose of converting the output charge of the piezoelectric beam into current. The test results show that when the external excitation acceleration increases from 0.2 g to 1.5 g with an increment of 0.1 g, the peak-to-peak value of the output voltage of the proposed sensors increases from 0.327 V to 2.774 V at a frequency of 1075 Hz. The voltage sensitivity of the piezoelectric beam is 0.85 V/g and that of the proposed acceleration sensor was 2.05 V/g, which is 2.41 times higher than the piezoelectric beam. The proposed sensor can effectively improve the voltage output sensitivity and can be used in the field of structural health monitoring.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-09-10", "authors": ["ChunpengAi", "XiaofengZhao", "DianzhongWen"], "doi": "10.3390/s20174988\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.03.017\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2166953\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.923582\n10.1016/j.vlsi.2018.03.018\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2886043\n10.3390/mi10090589\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.09.055\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.010\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.06.017\n10.1007/s12206-013-0133-8\n10.3390/mi9030120\n10.3390/mi9010019\n10.1109/jmems.2007.909100\n10.3390/mi10040238\n10.3390/mi9060266\n10.3390/s20061780\n10.1002/aelm.201901265\n10.1007/s00542-018-04292-0\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.06.051\n10.1088/0960-1317/6/1/032\n10.1142/S0217979219501923\n10.1111/jace.16255\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2966013\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.12.019\n10.1007/s11664-019-07341-0\n10.3390/mi10050331\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.09.025\n10.1088/0960-1317/11/1/311\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.116114\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.10.067\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106881\n10.1021/am4060436\n10.1063/1.1287606\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.06.007\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/5/055017\n10.1016/j.microrel.2016.12.016\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.013\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2707063\n10.1016/j.tsf.2019.04.018\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.01.036\n10.1088/0960-1317/15/5/014"}

Typically, the electrical resistance increases exponentially with strain, and the piezoresistive sensitivity and linearity cannot be improved simultaneously. In this work, we report a facile method to tune the piezoresistive behavior of melt-mixed poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/carbon nanotube (CNT, 0.75-2.0 wt %) composites using blending with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, 5-30 wt %). PVDF and PMMA are completely miscible in the melt state regardless of the proportion. For PVDF-rich blends, the crystallization of PVDF induces separation of the PVDF crystal region from the miscible PVDF/PMMA amorphous blend part during the cooling process. Addition of PMMA tuned the piezoresistive strain behavior and improved the electrical conductivity and toughness at the same time. The PVDF/PMMA/CNT composites show higher sensitivity at low strains than their PVDF/CNT counterparts with comparable initial resistivity.

One-dimentional (1D) structural magnetic metals have potential as EM absorption materials. However, fabricating 1D core-shell bimetallic magnetic species is a significant challenge. Herein, 1D core-shell bimetallic magnetic chains are successfully prepared through a modified galvanic replacement reaction under an external magnetic field, which could facilitate the preparation of 1D core-shell noble magnetic chains. By delicately designing the orientation of bimetallic magnetic chains in polyvinylidene fluoride, the composites reveal the decreased complex permittivity and increased permeability compared with random counterparts. Thus, elevated EM wave absorption perfromances including an optimal reflection loss of -43.5 dB and an effective bandwidth of 7.3 GHz could be achieved for the oriented Cu@Co sample.

{"title": "Low delay rate adaptive pacemaker using FPGA embedded piezoelectric sensor.", "abstract": "This paper presents the hardware implementation of low delay, power-efficient, rate-adaptive dual-chamber pacemaker (RDPM) using a piezoelectric sensor. Rate adaptive pacemaker has the ability to sense the patient's activity by means of some special sensors and it controls the pacing rate according to the patient's activity. Ideally, there should be no delay between sensing and the subsequent pacing operation performed by the pacemaker. However, delay in the responses of various components in the circuitry produces an accumulative delay effect in any practical circuit. Physical activity and the physiological needs of the patient can be easily adapted by the rate-responsive pacemakers using a wide range of sensor information. The piezo-electric sensor recognises the pressure on human muscles because of physical activity and converts it to an electrical signal, which is received by the pulse generator of the pacemaker. When the patient is in the rest mode, the heart rate is the only parameter that is to be detected by the pacemaker. Thus, the heart rate and the physical activity both are the inevitable parameters for the design of RDPM. Performance analysis of the proposed RDPM shows a significant reduction in the delay between sensing and pacing. Device utility analysis shows that the proposed design not only requires lesser memory but also reduces the number of components on the chip. Therefore, it becomes very clear that the proposed pacemaker design will consume much lesser power.", "journal": "Journal of medical engineering & technology", "date": "2020-09-05", "authors": ["RohiniSrivastava", "SonaliRay", "MeenakshiSharma", "NitinSahai", "Ravi PTewari", "BasantKumar"], "doi": "10.1080/03091902.2020.1799097"}

{"title": "Piezoelectric bone surgery compared with conventional rotary instruments in oral surgery and implantology: Summary and consensus statements of the International Piezoelectric Surgery Academy Consensus Conference 2019.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric bone surgery was introduced into clinical practice almost 20 years ago as an alternative method for cutting bone in dental surgical procedures, in an attempt to reduce the disadvantages of using conventional rotary instruments. The aim of this Consensus Conference was to evaluate the current evidence concerning the use of piezoelectric surgery in oral surgery and implantology.\nThree working groups conducted three meta-analyses with trial sequential analysis, focusing on the use of piezoelectric surgery in impacted mandibular third molar extraction, lateral sinus floor elevation and implant site preparation. The method of preparation of the systematic reviews, based on comprehensive search strategies and following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was discussed and standardised.\nModerate/low evidence suggests that piezoelectric surgery is significantly associated with a more favourable postoperative course (less pain, less trismus) after impacted mandibular third molar extraction than conventional rotary instruments. Moderate evidence suggests that implants inserted with piezoelectric surgery showed improved secondary stability during the early phases of healing compared with those inserted using a drilling technique. Strong/moderate evidence suggests that piezoelectric surgery prolongs the duration of surgery in impacted mandibular third molar extraction, sinus floor elevation and implant site preparation, but it is unclear whether the slight differences in duration of surgery, even if statistically significant, represent a real clinical advantage for either operator or patient. Weak evidence or insufficient data are present to draw definitive conclusions on the other investigated outcomes.\nFurther well-designed trials are needed to fully evaluate the effects of piezoelectric surgery, especially in implant site preparation and sinus floor elevation.", "journal": "International journal of oral implantology (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2020-09-04", "authors": ["FrancescoBassi", "MarcoCicci\u00f9", "RobertoDi Lenarda", "PabloGalindo Moreno", "FabioGalli", "Alan ScottHerford", "Asbj\u00f8rnJokstad", "TeresaLombardi", "MyronNevins", "LarsSennerby", "GianmarioSchierano", "TizianoTestori", "GiuseppeTroiano", "TomasoVercellotti", "ClaudioStacchi"], "doi": null}

This paper proposes a tunable concentration gradient generator actuated by acoustically oscillating bubbles trapped in the bubble channels using a controllable position based on the gas permeability of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The gradient generator consists of a glass substrate, a PDMS chip, and a piezoelectric transducer. When the trapped bubbles are activated by acoustic waves, the solution near the gas-liquid interface is mixed. The volume of the bubbles and the position of the gas-liquid interface are regulated through the permeability of the PDMS wall. The tunable concentration gradient can be realized by changing the numbers and positions of the bubbles that enable the mixing of fluids in the main channel, and the amplitude of the applied voltage. This new device is easy to fabricate, responsive, and biocompatible, and therefore has great application prospects.

Herein, composite Janus MD membranes comprising an ultrathin dense hydrophilic layer are developed by layer-by-layer assembling cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) polyelectrolytes on a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride substrate. Using surfactant-containing saline water as the feed with low surface tension, experiments reveal that the number of polyelectrolyte layers, rather than surface wettability or surface charge, determines the anti-wetting performance of the composite Janus membranes. More deposited layers yield higher wetting resistance. With the aid of positron annihilation spectroscopy, this study, for the first time, demonstrates the origin of the excellent wetting resistance of the composite Janus membranes. The effective pore size of the polyelectrolyte multilayer decreases with an increase in the number of the deposited layer. The membrane with an ultrathin hydrophilic multilayer of 48 nm has a sufficiently small pore size to sieve out surfactant molecules from the feed solution via a size exclusion mechanism, thus protecting the hydrophobic substrate from being wetted by the low-surface-tension feed water. This study may pave the way for developing next-generation anti-wetting Janus membranes for robust membrane distillation.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2020-09-03", "authors": ["YuanmiaoliangChen", "Kang-JiaLu", "SusiloJapip", "Tai-ShungChung"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.0c04242"}

Various osteotomy techniques have been developed to reduce postoperative edema and ecchymosis and achieve optimal aesthetic results. In this study, we aimed to compare the early and long-term effects of piezoelectric surgery with conventional osteotomy.\nIn this prospective study, 72 rhinoplasty patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to osteotomy technique used, either conventional osteotomy or piezosurgery. These 2 groups were compared for postoperative edema, ecchymosis, and pain on the first and seventh postoperative days. The sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22), peak nasal flowmetry, and Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test were applied to all patients before and 8 weeks after surgery.\nThe study consisted of 72 patients, 42 of whom were female and 30 were male. The mean age was 28.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.5 (range 18-49 years). On the first postoperative day, edema and ecchymosis were significantly less in the piezosurgery group (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). VAS results showed that only the piezosurgery group experienced less pain on the first postoperative day (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Nasal airflow of the patients was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, nasal airflow decreased postoperatively in both groups, but this decrease was not statistically significant, and no significant difference was found between the groups. The preoperative and postoperative comparison of odor functions was similar in both groups after the operation, and there was no significant difference between the groups.\nPiezosurgery in the early period after rhinoplasty has been shown to decrease eyelid edema, periorbital ecchymosis, and pain compared to conventional osteotomy techniques.

{"title": "A structural impedance measurement method by using polyvinylidene fluoride as actuator and sensor.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) patches have extremely small Young's modulus and piezoelectric coefficients. They are usually chosen as sensors in the structural impedance measurement for health monitoring. In this paper, a novel method is demonstrated for structural impedance measurement using PVDF patches as actuators and sensors. The impedance of the host structure is decoupled from the capacitance impedance of the piezoelectric transducer by using one of the patches as the actuator and the other as the sensor. Phase sensitive detection is then adopted to recover weak impedance signals in the experimental studies. This technique enables measurement of the resonant frequencies and further identification of the health condition of the host structure. The superiority of this method is illustrated theoretically comparing to the conventional impedance-base method. A prototype consisting of a metal cantilever with two PVDF patches is fabricated and tested. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the detection of the resonance of the substrate precisely with respect to FEM simulation and the results under base-movement excitations.

However, it is challenging or tedious to characterize its distribution and effect on the membrane structures due to the equipment resolution limitation, discrete nano-scaled structures of POMs, and limited doping amount compared to the polymeric membrane matrix. In this paper, POMs-functionalized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were fabricated by phase inversion combined with the sol-gel method, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to analyze the nanocomposite membrane intrinsic properties. Through adjusting the additives in the sol-forming process, a set of membranes with varied intrinsic properties were developed accordingly. The wetting degree of the membranes related to the hydrophilic nature of the membrane surfaces had a crucial influence on the impedance measurements at the early stage. Through EIS analysis, it was demonstrated that the amination of the membrane matrix through (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) treatment and the immobilization of POMs through electrostatic attraction would not generate new pore structures into the membrane and only alter the membrane surface roughness and composition. To my knowledge, it is the first time that EIS was utilized to characterize the hydrophilicity of the membranes and pore structures of the POMs-modified membranes.

{"title": "Enhancement of PVDF Sensing Characteristics by Retooling the Near-Field Direct-Write Electrospinning System.", "abstract": "This research aimed to develop a direct-write near-field electrospinning system (DW-NFES) with three-axis positioning of controllable speed, torque and position to produce sizable and high-quality piezoelectric fibers for sensing purposes. Sensor devices with high electrical response signals were developed and tested. To achieve DW-NFES purpose, a servo motor controller was designed to develop a high response rate, accurate positioning, and stable mobile device through the calculation of bandwidth and system time delay. With this retooled system of DW-NFES, controllable and uniform size fibers in terms of diameters, stretching force, and interspaces can be obtained. Sensor devices can be made selectively without a complicated lithography process. The characteristics of this DW-NFES platform were featured by high response rate, accurate positioning, and stable movement to make fibers with high piezoelectric property. In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used to explore and enhance their sensing quality through the platform. The parametric study of the process factors on piezoelectric sensing signals mainly included the concentration of electrospinning PVDF solution, high voltage electric field, and collection speed. Finally, the surface morphology and piezoelectric properties of the as-electrospun PVDF fibers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and characterized by electrical response measurement techniques. The results showed that the fiber spinning speed of the DW-NFES system could be increased to ~125 from ~20 mm/s and the accuracy precision was improved to ~1 from ~50 \u03bcm, compared to conventional step motor system. The fiber diameter reached ~10 \u03bcm, and the electrospinning pitch reached to as small as ~10 \u03bcm. The piezoelectric output voltage of the electrospun fibers was increased ~28.6% from ~97.2 to ~125 mV; the current was increased ~27.6% from ~163 to ~208 nA, suggesting that the piezoelectric signals can be enhanced significantly by using this retooled system. Finally, an external control module (Arduino-MAGE) was introduced to control the PVDF piezoelectric fiber sensors integrated as a sensing array.

{"title": "A comparative study of photoplethysmogram and piezoelectric plethysmogram signals.", "abstract": "The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal is one of the most important vital signals in biomedical applications. The non-invasive property and the convenience in the acquisition of both PPG and Piezoelectric Plethysmogram (PZPG) signals are considered as powerful and accurate tools for biomedical diagnosing applications, such as oxygen saturation in blood, blood flow, and blood pressure measurements. In this paper, a number of features for PPG and PZPG signals (ex. first derivative, second derivative, area under the curve and the ratio of systolic area to the diastolic area) are acquired and compared. The results show that both systems are able to extract the pulse rate (PR) and pulse rate variability (PRV), accurately with an estimation error of less than 10%. The averaged standard deviation of the ratio of the systolic area to the diastolic area for the first derivative of PPG and PZPG signals was small with less than 0.49 and 0.69 for the PPG and PZPG, respectively. Statistical analysis techniques (such as cross-correlation, P-value test, and Bland Altman method) are performed to address the relation between the PPG and PZPG signals. All of these methods showed a strong relationship between the features of the two signals (i.e. PPG and PZPG). The correlation value is found to be 0.954 with a p-value of\u2009<\u20090.05. This opens possibilities for combining both the PPG and PZPG systems to extract more features that can be used in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Such a system can provide a possibility to reduce the number of devices connected to patients (especially in emergencies) by means of measuring simultaneously both signals (PZPG and PPG).", "journal": "Physical and engineering sciences in medicine", "date": "2020-09-02", "authors": ["QasemQananwah", "AhmadDagamseh", "HiamAlquran", "Khalid ShakerIbrahim", "Moh'dAlodat", "OliverHayden"], "doi": "10.1007/s13246-020-00923-x"}
{"title": "Peripheral Mechanobiology of Touch-Studies on Vertebrate Cutaneous Sensory Corpuscles.", "abstract": "The vertebrate skin contains sensory corpuscles that are receptors for different qualities of mechanosensitivity like light brush, touch, pressure, stretch or vibration. These specialized sensory organs are linked anatomically and functionally to mechanosensory neurons, which function as low-threshold mechanoreceptors connected to peripheral skin through A\u03b2 nerve fibers. Furthermore, low-threshold mechanoreceptors associated with A\u03b4 and C nerve fibers have been identified in hairy skin. The process of mechanotransduction requires the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into electrical signals (action potentials) through the activation of mechanosensible ion channels present both in the axon and the periaxonal cells of sensory corpuscles (i.e., Schwann-, endoneurial- and perineurial-related cells). Most of those putative ion channels belong to the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (especially the family of acid-sensing ion channels), the transient receptor potential channel superfamilies, and the Piezo family.

A data logger monitors wave propagation by recording from two miniature accelerometers mounted on the skin above the tendon. Wave speed is determined from the wave travel time between accelerometers. The wearable system was used to record Achilles tendon wave speed at 100 Hz during 1-km outdoor walking trials in nine young adults. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) simultaneously monitored participant position, walking speed, and ground incline. An analysis of 5108 walking strides revealed the coupled biomechanical effects of terrain slope and walking speed on tendon loading. Uphill slopes increased the tendon wave speed during push-off, whereas downhill slopes increased tendon wave speeds during early stance braking. Walking speed significantly modulated peak tendon wave speed on uphill slopes but had less influence on downhill slopes. Walking speed consistently induced greater early stance wave speeds for all slopes. These observations demonstrate that wearable shear wave tensiometry holds promise for evaluating tendon tissue kinetics in natural environments and uncontrolled movements. There are numerous practical applications of wearable tensiometry spanning orthopedics, athletics, rehabilitation, and ergonomics.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-08-30", "authors": ["Sara EHarper", "Rebecca ARoembke", "John DZunker", "Darryl GThelen", "Peter GAdamczyk"], "doi": "10.3390/s20174805\n10.1007/s40279-015-0332-9\n10.1177/1941738115616917\n10.1016/j.ergon.2015.07.002\n10.3390/ijerph15092001\n10.1109/METROI4.2019.8792843\n10.1109/LRA.2019.2908491\n10.1155/2018/5405680\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2018.07.007\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.04.003\n10.3390/s18030873\n10.3390/s19071597\n10.1007/s00415-018-8786-y\n10.3389/fneur.2018.01036\n10.3390/s140100443\n10.3390/s17040825\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.05.012\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2018.12.008\n10.1016/j.orthtr.2019.06.001\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2018.09.017\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2250972\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2245131\n10.3390/s16050727\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2008.08.003\n10.1016/S0004-9514(14)60467-0\n10.1016/S0021-9290(02)00414-1\n10.1016/0021-9290(90)90038-5\n10.1016/S0268-0033(05)80006-3\n10.1007/BF00635880\n10.1007/s004210050335\n10.3390/s18082564\n10.3390/s17010075\n10.1109/TBME.2006.889769\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2005.05.008\n10.1109/TIM.2013.2245185\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.05.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0210000\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2015.07.012\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.10.032\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1295425\n10.1249/JES.0000000000000049\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.05.008\n10.1038/s41467-018-03797-6\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.06.008\n10.1109/TBME.2020.3005353\n10.1177/016173469501700204\n10.7717/peerj.2652\n10.1080/10255842.2010.527837\n10.1038/s41598-019-49063-7\n10.1242/jeb.02434\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.05.005\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.03.032\n10.1016/j.neucli.2008.02.002\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.01.001\n10.3390/s19081925\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2015.09.024\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.10.024\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2016.10.002\n10.3389/fspor.2020.00069\n10.1249/MSS.0000000000000560\n10.1249/MSS.0000000000002287\n10.1007/s12369-017-0424-9\n10.1109/LRA.2017.2729666\n10.3182/20120905-3-HR-2030.00134"}

{"title": "The Minimally Invasive-Guided Genioplasty Technique using Piezosurgery and 3D printed surgical guide: An innovative technique.", "abstract": "Mental nerve injuries with neurosensory deficits, asymmetries, and intra-operative bleeding are the main immediate complications of genioplasty. Following a recent systematic review, three-dimensional (3D)-printed cutting guide could improve the predictability and accuracy of this surgical technique avoiding postoperative asymmetries. Furthermore, anatomical structures in the surgical area (mental nerve and teeth roots) are better protected, reducing the morbidity and providing safer results. Ultrasonic piezoelectric osteotomy allows by its intrinsic characteristics, a selective cut of mineralized structure with a lower risk of vascular and nervous damage (microvibrations), intra-operative precision (thin cutting scalpel and no macro-vibrations), and blood-free site (cavitation effect). The aim of this article is to present a new minimally invasive technique: the minimally invasive-guided genioplasty technique (aka MIGG technique). This technique combines the advantages of piezosurgery and of a space-saving 3D-printed cutting guide, requiring open-source programs and an affordable 3D printing technology.\nAll the steps of this technique are described: preoperative surgical planning (CT scanner, segmentation with 3D slicer\u00ae, and design of the cutting guide with Blender\u00ae) and 3D printing of the guide and sterilization of it. The surgical procedure is presented in detail as well as the postoperative care.\nThe MIGG technique offers, according to the authors, a better postoperative recuperation, a reduction in operating time, less complications, and protection of the anatomical structures (mental nerve, teeth, lingual soft tissue and vessels). This minimally invasive technique for genioplasty is a promising approach to perform a chin osteotomy.", "journal": "Annals of maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2020-08-29", "authors": ["OlivierOth", "Maria FernandaOrellana", "R\u00e9gineGlineur"], "doi": "10.4103/ams.ams_78_19"}

{"title": "Analysis on the Radial Vibration of Longitudinally Polarized Radial Composite Tubular Transducer.", "abstract": "The radial vibration of a radial composite tubular transducer with a large radiation range and power capacity is studied. The transducer is composed of a longitudinally polarized piezoelectric ceramic tube and a coaxial outer metal tube. Assuming that the longitudinal length is much larger than the radius, the electromechanical equivalent circuits of the radial vibration of a piezoelectric ceramic long tube and a metal long tube are derived and obtained for the first time following the plane strain theory. As per the condition of the continuous forces and displacements of two contact surfaces, the electromechanical equivalent circuit of the tubular transducer is obtained. The radial resonance/anti-resonance frequency equation and the expression of the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient are obtained. Then, the effects of the radial geometry dimension of the transducer on the vibration characteristics are analyzed. The theoretical resonance frequencies, anti-resonance frequencies, and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficients at the fundamental mode and the second mode are in good agreement with the finite element analysis (FEA) results. The study shows that when the overall size of the transducer is unchanged, as the proportion of piezoelectric ceramic increases, the radial resonance/anti-resonance frequency and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of the transducer at the fundamental mode and the second mode have certain characteristics.

We show the first-principles plus Monte Carlo simulation evidence that many hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics (e.g. organic PhMDA) can be ideal candidates, which are also flexible and lead-free. Owing to the specific features of hydrogen bonding, their proton hopping barrier will drastically increase with prolonged proton transfer distance, while their hydrogen-bonded network can be easily compressed or stretched due to softness of hydrogen bonds. Their barriers as well as the Curie temperature can be approximately doubled upon a tensile strain as low as 2%. Their Curie temperature can be tuned exactly to room temperature by fixing a strain in one direction, and in another direction, an unprecedented ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient of 2058 pC/N can be obtained. This value is even underestimated and can be greatly enhanced when applying a smaller strain.

{"title": "Igg-Dependent Hydrolysis of Myelin Basic Protein of Patients with Different Courses of Schizophrenia.", "abstract": "The level hydrolysis of myelin basic protein (MBP) by IgG in patients with schizophrenia was studied depending on the clinical features and course of the disease. The patients were grouped according to type of schizophrenia and type of disease course. We found that IgGs isolated and purified from sera of schizophrenia patients' blood hydrolyses human MBP, and the level of this hydrolysis significantly exceeds that of healthy individuals. Detection of protease activity corresponding only to intact IgGs in polyacrylamide gel fragments, together with data of gel filtration of antibodies under conditions of \"acid shock\" (concordance of optical density profile of IgG with profile of MBP-hydrolyzing activity) and with the absence of any other proteins and bands in gradient SDS-PAGE and in PVDF membrane provides direct evidence that the IgGs from the schizophrenia patients have MBP-hydrolyzing activity. The antibodies-specific proteolytic activity of patients with acute schizophrenia (1.026 [0.205; 3.372] mg MBP/mg IgG/h) significantly exceeds the activity of IgG in patients in remission (0.656 [0.279; 0.873] mg MBP/mg IgG/h) and in healthy individuals (0.000 [0.00; 0.367] mg MBP/mg IgG/h). When comparing the specific activity in patients with different types of disease course, we have found that patients with a continuous course of paranoid schizophrenia (1.810 [0.746; 4.101\u2009mg MBP/mg IgG/h]) had maximal activity values.

However, their use in regulate the behaviors of neural stem cells has not been fully explored, besides, the isotropic inverse opal structures usually lack the ability to induce the oriented cell growth which is fundamental in neural regeneration based on neural stem cell therapy. In this paper, the anisotropic inverse opal substrates were obtained by mechanically stretching the poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) inverse opal films. The anisotropic inverse opal substrates possessed good biocompatibility, optical properties and anisotropy, provided well guidance for the formation of neural spheroids, the alignment of neural stem cells, the differentiation of neural stem cells, the oriented growth of derived neurons and the dendritic complexity of the newborn neurons.

However, in-depth understanding of the energy conversion, boosting, and preservation processes of the coupled piezo-dielectric phenomenon in polymeric artificial materials is still lacking. In this study, combined experimental and simulation methods are employed to rationalize the process of energy conversion and preservation via a coupled piezo-dielectric phenomena in composite polymeric films. Both the intensity of the transmembrane electric voltages and the kinetic aspects of the energy generation and preservation process are elucidated. The study indicates that composite films consisting of a conductive filler fraction below the percolation threshold, effectively convert low-frequency mechanical stimulation to preserved electrical energy. Interestingly, film structure engineered into porous film has the ability to break the intertwined high-voltage and exhibits a low-preservation-period relationship; it can simultaneously provide high electric field intensity, high induction velocity, and a long preservation period. The model is not only supported by the experiments but is also consistent with the electricity generation and preservation features of other reported piezo-dielectric films.

{"title": "Understanding KO", "abstract": "Functional coatings based on alkali metals have become increasingly attractive in the current shift towards sustainable technologies. While lithium-based compounds have a natural impact on batteries, other alkali metal compounds are important as replacements for toxic materials in a range of electronic devices. This is especially true for potassium, being a major component in e.g. KxNa1-xNbO3 (KNN) and KTaxNb1-xO3 (KTN), with hope to replace Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT) in piezo-/ferroelectric and electrooptic devices. ALD facilitates functional conformal coatings at deposition temperatures far below what is reported using other techniques and with excellent compositional control. The ALD growth of potassium-containing films using KOtBu has, however, been unpredictable. Untraditional response to the pulse composition and precursor dose, severe reproducibility issues, and very high growth per cycle are some of the puzzling features of these processes. In this article, we shed light on the growth behavior of KOtBu in ALD by in situ quartz crystal microbalance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies. We study the precursor's behavior in the technologically interesting KNbO3-process, showing how the potassium precursor strongly affects the growth of other cation precursors. We show that the strong hygroscopic nature of the intermediary potassium species has far-reaching implications throughout the growth.

Periapical lesions were confirmed using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Endodontic microsurgery for the mesial and distal roots of tooth #36 was planned. Following the transfer of data of the CBCT images and the scanned cast to an implant surgical planning program, data from both devices were merged. A surgical stent was designed, on the superimposed three-dimensional model, to guide the preparation of a cortical window on the buccal side of tooth #36. Endodontic microsurgery was performed with a printed surgical template. Minimal osteotomy was required and preservation of the buccal cortical plate rendered this endodontic surgery less traumatic.

{"title": "A modelling framework for simulation of ultrasonic guided wave-based inspection of welded rail tracks.", "abstract": "A modelling framework for ultrasonic inspection of waveguides with arbitrary discontinuities, excited using piezoelectric transducers, is developed. The framework accounts for multi-modal, dispersive and damped one dimensional propagation over long distances. The proposed model is applied to simulate a realistic guided wave-based inspection of a welded rail. The framework models the excitation, propagation and scattering of guided waves from welds by respectively employing a hybrid model that couples a 3D FEM model of a piezoelectric transducer with a 2D SAFE model of the rail; a 2D SAFE model of the rail; and another hybrid method which couples a 3D FEM model of the arbitrary discontinuity (weld) with two SAFE models of the rail to represent the semi-infinite incoming and outgoing waveguides. Optimal damping parameters for hysteretic and viscous damping, respectively, are determined using a model updating procedure to approximate attenuation in the rail. Good agreement between the experimental measurement and simulation is demonstrated, even for weld reflections originating over 640\u00a0m from the transducer location. The proposed physics-based framework can be used to efficiently perform multiple analyses considering different numbers and locations of welds, different excitation signals or to investigate the effects of changes in parameters such as transducer geometry, or material property variations caused by temperature fluctuations. The framework could therefore be used in future to set up a digital twin of a section of rail track, or in the development of a rail monitoring system by predicting reflections from defects which cannot readily be measured, but which can be simulated.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-08-25", "authors": ["Dineo ARamatlo", "Craig SLong", "Philip WLoveday", "Daniel NWilke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106215"}
{"title": "Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia elicits sleep disturbances in na\u00efve mice.", "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic prevalent condition characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation (SF). Evidence suggests that OSA can alter the gut microbiome (GM) diversity and composition that may then promote the occurrence of some of the OSA-associated morbidities. However, it is unclear whether perturbations in the GM caused by IH can elicit sleep disturbances that underlie the increased sleep propensity that occurs in IH-exposed mice. To evaluate this issue, we exposed C57Bl/6\u00a0J mice to IH or room air (RA) for 6\u00a0weeks, and fecal matter was collected and frozen. C57Bl/6\u00a0J na\u00efve mice were then randomly assigned to a fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) protocol for 3\u00a0weeks with either IH or RA fecal slur, and their GM was then analyzed using 16\u00a0s rRNA sequencing. In addition, FMT recipients underwent sleep recordings using piezoelectric approaches for 3 consecutive days. As anticipated, FMT-IH and FMT-RA mice showed different taxonomic profiles that corresponded to previous effects of IH on GM. Furthermore, FMT-IH mice exhibited increased sleep duration and the frequency of longer sleep bouts during the dark cycle, suggesting increased sleepiness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 vs. FMT-RA mice). Thus, alterations of GM diversity induced by IH exposures can elicit sleep disturbances in the absence of concurrent IH, suggesting that sleep disturbances can be mediated, at least in part, by IH-induced alterations in GM.", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "date": "2020-08-25", "authors": ["MohammadBadran", "AbdelnabyKhalyfa", "AaronEricsson", "DavidGozal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.expneurol.2020.113439\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00081.2016\n10.1038/s41366-020-0549-z\n10.1016/j.sleep.2017.07.018\n10.1038/nature09944\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.03.011\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.011\n10.1016/j.molmet.2016.10.003\n10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30198-5\n10.1186/s13073-016-0303-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0229001\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3009759\n10.1016/0031-9384(90)90300-S\n10.1016/j.molmet.2016.05.011\n10.1136/gut.2008.165886\n10.1073/pnas.1000080107\n10.1186/1475-925X-7-14\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06672\n10.1016/j.chest.2018.03.001\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01556\n10.1016/j.patbio.2014.05.015\n10.1089/jmf.2014.7000\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074963\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11695\n10.1038/nrendo.2016.22\n10.1523/jneurosci.21-07-02442.2001\n10.1165/rcmb.2016-0243OC\n10.1177/1756283X13482996\n10.1001/jama.2017.6466\n10.1016/j.jsmc.2017.03.010\n10.1210/jc.2013-3327\n10.1042/CS20180891\n10.1002/brb3.1287\n10.3390/nu9080859\n10.1186/s40168-016-0222-x\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.11.010\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr507\n10.5665/sleep.3936\n10.1038/s41366-020-0548-0\n10.5664/jcsm.7990\n10.1172/JCI76304\n10.1183/09031936.00184314\n10.5665/sleep.6176\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aah6888\n10.1016/0006-8993(83)90101-4\n10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.03.006\n10.3390/microorganisms7020041\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104856\n10.2147/NSS.S214423\n10.1289/ehp.117-a198\n10.1016/j.sleep.2005.06.006\n10.1038/srep35405\n10.1038/nri.2016.42\n10.1093/sleep/29.2.152\n10.5665/sleep.5042\n10.1007/s11912-014-0406-0\n10.2174/1381612824666181001153605\n10.1371/journal.pone.0222394\n10.1038/s41467-019-10430-7\n10.3967/bes2018.122\n10.1128/msystems.00020-18\n10.1128/msystems.00058-19\n10.1038/s41564-018-0337-x\n10.1093/sleep/27.2.194\n10.5665/sleep.3038\n10.1194/jlr.M002774\n10.1111/bph.14366\n10.1111/j.1574-6968.2000.tb09265.x\n10.3390/nu12020381\n10.18632/oncotarget.17754\n10.1016/j.smrv.2016.10.002"}

{"title": "Rapid Soft Material Actuation Through Droplet Evaporation.", "abstract": "Soft material actuation is a promising field that can potentially solve several limitations of traditional robotic systems. These systems comprise soft and flexible materials to achieve high degrees of freedom and compliance with their surroundings. One method to actuate such structures is to vaporize liquid that is embedded inside the soft material. The soft elastomers are inflated since the generated vapor occupies a much larger volume after phase transformation. The simplest and widely used design to vaporize such liquids is installing a heating element near the liquid. Heating the system beyond the boiling point rapidly boils the liquid and deforms the structure. However, this technique possesses several limitations, such as the heating element must be in the liquid's vicinity, and boiling the liquid requires high temperatures. In addition, embedding a small amount of liquid for faster boiling prevents the use of valves to exhaust the vapor. Instead, the structure is slowly cooled until it returns to its original position. In this study, these limitations are addressed by combining heating with vibrating mesh atomization. The atomizer disperses the liquid into small droplets, which vaporize much faster as compared with simply heating the bulk liquid. Actuation through vibrating mesh atomization was first characterized and compared with other techniques. Then, the introduced method was used to demonstrate cyclic actuation, and a bistable structure was designed and fabricated to demonstrate gripping motion.", "journal": "Soft robotics", "date": "2020-08-25", "authors": ["Han-JooLee", "PeerasaitPrachaseree", "Kenneth JLoh"], "doi": "10.1089/soro.2020.0055"}

{"title": "PVDF Sensor Foils Employed to Measure Shear Stress and Temperature of Friction Welding.", "abstract": "Friction welding is a popular process for joining metal and polymer work pieces by rubbing them against each other. This way, friction heat is generated in a zone of the faying surfaces, thinner than 1 mm. After cooling down, the heated surfaces establish a tight and strong bond. To improve this joining process, a method is desirable allowing measuring generated temperature and shear stress in the zone between the joining work pieces. Unfortunately, this is a very difficult task because the welding zone cannot be accessed with a sensor without significantly altering the process and thereby the desired measurement results. This paper describes how shear stress and temperature change generated by rubbing polymer pieces in a friction welding machine have been measured between the faying surfaces by employing sensor foils from the piezoelectric and pyroelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). This way, heating and cooling rates, pressure rise of the pneumatic system, frequency rise of the starting machine, the duration of starting and stopping, the damping of the vibrations after the drive was stopped, and the stress generated by the pullback of the machine head have been measured. A careful characterization of the sensor was necessary to enable distinguishing the measured voltage due to straining, shearing and temperature change.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-08-23", "authors": ["WeiZou", "Werner KarlSchomburg"], "doi": "10.3390/s20164565\n10.1080/00107517108205660\n10.1179/174329307X249333\n10.1179/136217110X12785889550064\n10.1179/026708310X520510\n10.1002/pen.21784\n10.1007/s11661-015-2752-4\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.06.082\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.10.039\n10.1002/pen.760281508\n10.1179/136217104225021562\n10.1002/pen.760292309\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2014.08.052\n10.1002/pen.760292307\n10.1016/0043-1648(87)90122-0\n10.1007/BF03266716\n10.1016/0020-7403(90)90153-A\n10.1016/0956-7151(94)90369-7\n10.1016/S0921-5093(00)01036-4\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/2/013\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.514-516.202\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.07.010\n10.1177/0892705709356493\n10.1007/s00542-016-2836-0\n10.1007/s00542-018-3832-3\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.002\n10.1063/1.1662513\n10.1143/JJAP.8.975\n10.1007/978-3-662-47023-7\n10.1080/00150198608245016\n10.1063/1.1653624\n10.1007/s00542-020-04818-5"}

{"title": "Optimized CNT-PDMS Flexible Composite for Attachable Health-Care Device.", "abstract": "The CNT-PDMS composite has been widely adopted in flexible devices due to its high elasticity, piezoresistivity, and biocompatibility. In a wide range of applications, CNT-PDMS composite sensors were used for resistive strain measurement. Accordingly, the percolation threshold 2%~4% of the CNT weight ratio in the CNT-PDMS composite was commonly selected, which is expected to achieve the optimized piezoresistive sensitivity. However, the linear range around the percolation threshold weight ratio (2%~4%) limits its application in a stable output of large strain (>20%). Therefore, comprehensive understanding of the electromechanical, mechanical, and electrical properties for the CNT-PDMS composite with different CNT weight ratios was expected. In this paper, a systematic study was conducted on the piezoresistivity, Young's modulus, conductivity, impedance, and the cross-section morphology of different CNT weight ratios (1 to 10 wt%) of the CNT-PDMS composite material. It was experimentally observed that the piezo-resistive sensitivity of CNT-PDMS negatively correlated with the increase in the CNT weight ratio. However, the electrical conductivity, Young's modulus, tensile strength, and the linear range of piezoresistive response of the CNT-PDMS composite positively correlated with the increase in CNT weight ratio. Furthermore, the mechanism of these phenomena was analyzed through the cross-section morphology of the CNT-PDMS composite material by using SEM imaging. From this analysis, a guideline was proposed for large strain (40%) measurement applications (e.g., motion monitoring of the human body of the finger, arm, foot, etc.), the CNT weight ratio 8 wt% was suggested to achieve the best piezoresistive sensitivity in the linear range.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-08-23", "authors": ["JianDu", "LiWang", "YanbinShi", "FengZhang", "ShihengHu", "PengboLiu", "AnqingLi", "JunChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s20164523\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.024\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.11.063\n10.1038/nmat4782\n10.1038/s41746-019-0083-3\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.12.025\n10.1021/acsami.8b11766\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.041\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.01.019\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.01.020\n10.1126/science.aag2879\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.01.026\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.07.009\n10.1021/acsami.8b05407\n10.3390/polym10111243\n10.1038/nature16521\n10.1038/s41598-019-43625-5\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.06.006\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2190288\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.02.017\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.045\n10.1016/j.matlet.2009.02.043\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19980316)37:5<550::AID-ANIE550>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1016/j.tsf.2009.03.146\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/7/075012\n10.1088/1757-899X/203/1/012017\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00179\n10.1039/c2jm34262f\n10.1063/1.5089900\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.03.009\n10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.08.013\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.012\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.04.060\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2004.11.004\n10.1039/C7RA02439H\n10.1002/app.44780\n10.1021/jp901082c\n10.1109/TNANO.2010.2060350\n10.3390/nano2040329\n10.1021/acsami.9b00136\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/8/085019\n10.1108/SR-04-2017-0055\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2740325\n10.1021/nl052171d\n10.1002/smll.201700368\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.06.018\n10.1177/0021998319853034\n10.1103/PhysRevB.74.085403\n10.1063/1.1702682\n10.1007/s10853-018-2954-4\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.944\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.06.046\n10.4236/jmmce.2004.32008"}

{"title": "Flexible PZT-Integrated, Bilateral Sensors via Transfer-Free Laser Lift-Off for Multimodal Measurements.", "abstract": "Fabrication of functional devices that require a high-temperature annealing process on a thin, temperature-sensitive substrate is a long-standing, crucial issue in flexible electronics. Herein, we propose a transfer-free laser lift-off method to directly fabricate lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric sensors that commonly undergo a high-temperature annealing (\u223c650 \u00b0C) on ubiquitous flexible substrates, including polyimide (\u223c300 \u00b0C), polyethylene terephthalate (\u223c120 \u00b0C), and polydimethylsiloxane (\u223c150 \u00b0C). The method includes the steps of fabricating sensors, encapsulating a flexible substrate, and peeling off the device by melting the sacrificial PZT layer at the interface with a sapphire glass. The appropriate fluence of laser energy has been figured out to avoid inadequate stripping or damage of the device. In addition, a process window for reliable stripping of the device has been established among the laser fluence and the thickness of the sacrificial layer and the supporting substrate. Furthermore, the capability of the newly proposed technique has been verified and expanded by successfully integrating several sensors that need skillful low-temperature heating treatment on top of a flexible supporting substrate accordingly before stripping. Finally, a PZT-integrated, bilateral multimodal sensor on a PI substrate has been fabricated, and the device demonstrates excellent performance and stability toward perceiving distributed dynamic pressure and temperature stimuli, revealing its high potential for the fabrication of high-performance devices for multimodal sensing applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-08-21", "authors": ["ChenZhu", "DongliangGuo", "DongYe", "ShanJiang", "YongAnHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c10083"}

Bitter melon or bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) is an edible fruit that is commonly consumed, and it is used to cure different diseases in various ancient folk medical practices. We report that a bioactive protein, MAP30, isolated from bitter melon seeds exhibited potent anticancer and anti-chemoresistant effects on ovarian cancer cells. Functional studies revealed that MAP30 inhibited cancer cell migration, cell invasion, and cell proliferation in various ovarian cancer cells but not normal immortalized ovarian epithelial cells. When administered with cisplatin, MAP30 produced a synergistic effect on cisplatin-induced cell cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. When low doses of cisplatin and MAP30 were co-injected intraperitoneally, a remarkable reduction of tumor dissemination and tumor growth was observed in an ovarian cancer ascites mouse model. Notably, blood tests confirmed that MAP30 did not cause any adverse effects on liver and kidney functions in the treated mice. MAP30 activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling via CaMKK\u03b2 and induced cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. MAP30 modulated cell metabolism of ovarian cancer cells via suppression of GLUT-1/-3-mediated glucose uptake, adipogenesis, and lipid droplet formation in tumor development and progression.

In this work, we demonstrate a capability of high-resolution large-scale 3D visualization and quantification of the foulants on/in membranes during fouling process based on light sheet fluorescence microscopy as a noninvasive reproducible optical approach. The adsorption processes of dextran (DEX) on/in two polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity were clearly observed. For a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, the diffusion and adsorption of the DEX in membrane matrix were much slower compared to that for a hydrophobic membrane. A concentrated foulant layer was observed in the superficial potion of the hydrophilic membrane matrix while the foulants were observed quickly penetrating across the overall hydrophobic PVDF membrane during a short adsorption process. Both the inner concentrated fouling layer (in membrane superficial portion) and the foulant penetration (in membrane asymmetric structure) presented correlations with membrane fouling irreversibility, which could elucidate the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling. In addition, the imaging results could be correlated with the XDLVO analysis, suggesting how the membrane-foulant and foulant-foulant interfacial interactions resulted in a time-dependent membrane fouling process.

The tracker needle incorporates a piezo element near its tip that generates an electrical signal in response to insonation.

Our primary objective was to compare sciatic block performance with the tracker switched on and off. Our secondary objectives were to record psychometrics, procedure efficiency, participant self-regulation and focused attention using eye-tracking technology. Our primary outcome measures were the number of steps successfully performed and the number of errors committed during each block. Videos were scored by trained experts using validated checklists. Sequential tracker activation and deactivation was randomised equally within subjects. With needle activation, steps improved in 10 (25%) subjects and errors reduced in six (15%) subjects. The most important steps were: needle tip identification before injection, OR (95%CI) 2.12 (1.61-2.80; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and needle tip identification before advance of the needle, 1.80 (1.36-2.39; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The most important errors were: failure to identify the needle tip before injection, 2.40 (1.78-3.24; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and failure to quickly regain needle tip position when tip visibility was lost, 2.03 (1.5-2.75; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

{"title": "A Novel Stick-Slip Nanopositioning Stage Integrated with a Flexure Hinge-Based Friction Force Adjusting Structure.", "abstract": "The piezoelectrically-actuated stick-slip nanopositioning stage (PASSNS) has been applied extensively, and many designs of PASSNSs have been developed. The friction force between the stick-slip surfaces plays a critical role in successful movement of the stage, which influences the load capacity, dynamic performance, and positioning accuracy of the PASSNS. Toward solving the influence problems of friction force, this paper presents a novel stick-slip nanopositioning stage where the flexure hinge-based friction force adjusting unit was employed. Numerical analysis was conducted to estimate the static performance of the stage, a dynamic model was established, and simulation analysis was performed to study the dynamic performance of the stage. Further, a prototype was manufactured and a series of experiments were carried out to test the performance of the stage. The results show that the maximum forward and backward movement speeds of the stage are 1 and 0.7 mm/s, respectively, and the minimum forward and backward step displacements are approximately 11 and 12 nm, respectively. Compared to the step displacement under no working load, the forward and backward step displacements only increase by 6% and 8% with a working load of 20 g, respectively. And the load capacity of the PASSNS in the vertical direction is about 72 g. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed stage, and high accuracy, high speed, and good robustness to varying loads were achieved.

In this process, the lumen diameter of the membrane mostly determines the droplet size. To gain smaller droplets, approaches for downsizing the inner diameter of membranes have to be carried out. In this work, we describe a new method for the fabrication of parallel microfluidic porous-wall channels of a homogeneous cylindrical shape with lumen diameters down to 7 \u03bcm. Parallel and symmetric porous-wall channels are induced into polyvinylidene fluoride membranes during the casting process. The technique comprises liquid-induced phase separation and phase-separation micromolding using thin glass and carbon fibers as molds and an in-house designed tool to position the fibers. The channel positioning and alignment are verified within this work. We show and investigate the droplet formation in these porous-wall channels via hollow-fiber emulsification. The formed droplets are very small in diameter and size distribution. The droplet formation at varying flow rates and channel diameters is examined in detail. Moreover, an area of sufficient operating conditions is given using Weber and capillary numbers. As a numbering-up approach, we show the simultaneous formation of spherical droplets in two parallel channels. With the proposed membrane fabrication using micromolding, we push the downscaling approach of hollow-fiber emulsification to lower micron ranges of the channel diameter. With these small channels, droplets with a diameter down to 25 \u03bcm were produced, which are more attractive for most applications.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2020-08-17", "authors": ["Christian JLinnartz", "Hanna J MWolff", "Hans FBreisig", "MichaelAlders", "MatthiasWessling"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01647"}

To overcome this problem, a sustainable internal electric field was introduced into photocatalysis based on piezoelectric and pyroelectric effect, which exhibits good capability in consistently boosting photocatalytic activity, thus becoming a hot research topic. In this Perspective we summarize the recent significant progress in the construction of sustainable internal electric fields for facilitating photocatalysis from material design to energy utilization.

{"title": "Zyflamend, a unique herbal blend, induces cell death and inhibits adipogenesis through the coordinated regulation of PKA and JNK.", "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities has sparked a worldwide concern to address rates of adipose tissue accrual. Recent studies have demonstrated a novel role of Zyflamend, a blend of natural herbal extracts, in regulating lipid metabolism in several cancer cell lines through the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway. Yet, the role of Zyflamend in adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of Zyflamend on white 3T3-MBX pre-adipocyte differentiation and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that Zyflamend treatment altered cell cycle progression, attenuated proliferation, and increased cell death of 3T3-MBX pre-adipocytes. In addition, treatment with Zyflamend inhibited lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-MBX cells, consistent with decreased expression of lipogenic genes and increased lipolysis. Mechanistically, Zyflamend-induced alterations in adipogenesis were mediated, at least in part, through the activation of AMPK, PKA, and JNK. Inhibition of AMPK partially reversed Zyflamend-induced inhibition of differentiation, whereas the inhibition of either JNK or PKA fully restored adipocyte differentiation and decreased lipolysis. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Zyflamend, as a novel anti-adipogenic bioactive mix, inhibits adipocyte differentiation through the activation of the PKA and JNK pathways.\n7-AAD: 7-amino-actinomycin D; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AKT: protein kinase B; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATGL: adipose triglyceride lipase; C/EBP\u03b1: CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulphoxide; DTT: dithiothreitol; EGTA: ethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; FASN: fatty acid synthase; FBS: foetal bovine serum; GLUT: glucose transporter; HSL: hormone-sensitive lipase; IR: insulin receptor; IRS: insulin receptor substrate; JNK: c-JUN N-terminal kinase; MGL: monoacylglycerol lipase; NaF: sodium fluoride; NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PBS: phosphate buffered- saline; PCB: pyruvate carboxylase; PDE: phosphodiesterase; PKA: protein kinase cAMP-dependent; PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PPAR\u03b3: perilipin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PREF-1: pre-adipocyte factor 1; PVDF: polyvinylidene fluoride; RIPA: radio-immunoprecipitation assay; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOX9: suppressor of cytokine signalling 9; TGs: triacylglycerols.", "journal": "Adipocyte", "date": "2020-08-12", "authors": ["DexterPuckett", "MohammedAlquraishi", "Dina SAlani", "SamahChahed", "Victoria DFrankel", "DallasDonohoe", "BrynnVoy", "JayWhelan", "AhmedBettaieb"], "doi": "10.1080/21623945.2020.1803642"}

However, few techniques can perform concentrations of micro/nano objects in multi-well plates, a very common laboratory vessel. In this work, we develop an acoustofluidic multi-well plate, which adopts an array of simple, low-cost and commercially available ring-shaped piezoelectric transducers for rapid and robust enrichment of micro/nanoscale particles/cells in each well of the plate. The enrichment mechanism is validated and characterized through both numerical simulations and experiments. We observe that the ring-shaped piezoelectric transducer can generate circular standing flexural waves in the substrate of each well, and that the vibrations can induce acoustic streaming near the interface between the substrate and a fluid droplet placed within the well; this streaming can drive micro/nanoscale objects to the center of the droplet for enrichment. Moreover, the acoustofluidic multi-well plate can realize simultaneous and consistent enrichment of biological cells in each well of the plate. With merits such as simplicity, controllability, low cost, and excellent compatibility with other downstream analysis tools, the developed acoustofluidic multi-well plate could be a versatile tool for many applications such as micro/nano fabrication, self-assembly, biomedical/biochemical sensing, and tissue engineering.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2020-08-12", "authors": ["PengzhanLiu", "ZhenhuaTian", "NanjingHao", "HunterBachman", "PeiranZhang", "JunhuiHu", "Tony JunHuang"], "doi": "10.1039/d0lc00378f"}

{"title": "Drainage of amniotic fluid delays vocal fold separation and induces load-related vocal fold mucosa remodeling.", "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the role of mechanical load as generated by amniotic fluid in the vocal fold embryogenesis. In utero, amniotic fluid flows through the laryngeal inlet down into the lungs during fetal breathing and swallowing. In a mouse model, the onset of fetal breathing coincides with epithelial lamina recanalization. The epithelial lamina is a temporal structure that is formed during early stages of the larynx development and is gradually resorbed whereby joining the upper and lower airways. Here, we show that a temporary decrease in mechanical load secondary to drainage of amniotic fluid and subsequent flow restoration, impaired timing of epithelial lamina disintegration. Moreover, re-accumulation of fluid in the laryngeal region led to VF tissue deformation triggering remodeling of the epithelium and pressure generated changes in the elastic properties of the lamina propria, as measured by atomic force microscopy. We further show that load-related structural changes were likely mediated by Piezo 1 -Yap signaling pathway in the vocal fold epithelium.

{"title": "Simulation Study on Direct Contact Membrane Distillation Modules for High-Concentration NaCl Solution.", "abstract": "Membrane distillation technology, as a new membrane-based water treatment technology that combines the membrane technology and evaporation process, has the advantages of using low-grade heat, working at atmospheric pressure with simple configuration, etc. In this study, heat and mass transfer were coupled at the membrane surfaces through the user-defined function program. The effects of feed temperature, feed velocity and permeate velocity on temperature polarization were mainly investigated for a high-concentration NaCl solution. The temperature polarization was increased with the increase of feed temperature and the decrease of feed and permeate velocity. The effects of temperature, inlet velocity and solution concentration on the evaporation efficiency of the membrane module for co- and counter-current operations were investigated in detail. The counter-current operation performed better than co-current operation in most cases, except for the condition where the NaCl concentration was relatively low or the module length was long enough. In addition, the optimal membrane thickness for both PVDF and PTFE was studied. The optimal membrane thickness was found in the range of 10 to 20 \u03bcm, which corresponded to the highest permeate flux for the selected materials, pore size distribution, and operation conditions. Membrane material with lower thermal conductivity and larger porosity was prone to get higher permeate flux and had larger optimal membrane thickness. Increasing feed velocity or feed temperature could decrease the optimal membrane thickness.", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-08-09", "authors": ["WeimingNi", "YongliLi", "JuezhenZhao", "GaoyuanZhang", "XiaozeDu", "YingchaoDong"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10080179\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b01519\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b01907\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.012\n10.1021/acs.est.0c02809\n10.1021/acs.est.0c01084\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00498-2\n10.1039/C8EE00291F\n10.1016/j.desal.2015.08.014\n10.1016/j.envint.2020.105588\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.017\n10.1039/C9EW01055F\n10.1016/S0011-9164(02)00266-7\n10.1016/0011-9164(90)85030-E\n10.1016/j.memsci.2004.04.018\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.04.123\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.09.020\n10.1016/j.jiec.2014.06.009\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.12.030\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.05.074\n10.1016/j.seppur.2014.12.026\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.11.005\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.09.037\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.020\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.08.023\n10.1016/j.desal.2017.01.004\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.09.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.067\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.11.085\n10.1016/S0011-9164(03)00410-7\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.10.028\n10.1016/0376-7388(94)00289-B\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.07.037\n10.1016/j.desal.2018.11.005\n10.1016/S0376-7388(98)00349-4\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00603-8\n10.1002/aic.13845\n10.1016/0376-7388(90)80011-A\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.252\n10.1016/j.cherd.2013.06.030\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.01.020\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.043\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.06.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.12.048"}

Green emission has been demonstrated at wavelengths of 500 nm for the GaN template and 525 and 549 nm for the InGaNOS substrates, respectively. The structure, deformation, indium concentration and piezoelectric potentials have been measured with nm-scale spatial resolution in the same specimens by transmission electron microscopy. We show by off-axis electron holography that the piezoelectric potential and information about the indium concentration from the mean inner potential are obtained simultaneously. By separating the components using a model, we show that for higher concentrations of indium in the quantum wells (QWs) grown on InGaNOS substrates, the piezoelectric potentials are reduced. The measurements of the indium concentrations by electron holography have been verified by combining energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, x-ray diffraction and from the tensile deformation made by precession electron diffraction.

{"title": "Design of a Large-Scale Piezoelectric Transducer Network Layer and Its Reliability Verification for Space Structures.", "abstract": "As an effective structural health monitoring (SHM) technology, the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and guided wave-based monitoring methods have attracted growing interest in the space field. When facing the large-scale monitoring requirements of space structures, a lot of PZTs are needed and may cause problems regarding to additional weight of connection cables, placement efficiency and performance consistency. The PZT layer is a promising solution against these problems. However, the current PZT layers still face challenges from large-scale lightweight monitoring and the lack of reliability assessment under extreme space service conditions. In this paper, a large-scale PZT network layer (LPNL) design method is proposed to overcome these challenges, by adopting a large-scale lightweight PZT network design method and network splitting-recombination based integration strategy. The developed LPNL offers the advantages of being large size, lightweight, ultra-thin, flexible, customized in shape and highly reliable. A series of extreme environmental tests are performed to verify the reliability of the developed LPNL under space service environment, including extreme temperature conditions, vibration at different flying phases, landing impact, and flying overload. Results show that the developed LPNL can withstand these harsh environmental conditions and presents high reliability and functionality.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-08-08", "authors": ["YuanqiangRen", "JingyaTao", "ZhaopengXue"], "doi": "10.3390/s20154344\n10.1177/0096340215581360\n10.1002/stc.1992\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2016.12.017\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/1/029\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.05.019\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7168\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2598529\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035024\n10.3390/s140407394\n10.3390/app10041201\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.09.067\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/12/125001\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/2/042\n10.1177/1475921708090558\n10.1177/1045389X10369850\n10.1177/1475921719850641\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2941533\n10.1016/S0266-3538(02)00007-6\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/7/075032\n10.3390/s18072084\n10.3390/s16122110\n10.2528/PIER10090504\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.02.032\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/017\n10.1177/1475921713479643"}

{"title": "Finite element modeling of one-dimensional nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterial with anti-parallel diodes.", "abstract": "A class of passive nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials is developed to control the flow and distribution of acoustic energy in acoustic cavities and systems. Such development departs radically from present methods that favor the transmission direction by using hardwired arrangements of the hardware and hence, it cannot be reversed. The proposed nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterial (NAMM) cell consists of a cylindrical acoustic cavity with piezoelectric flexible boundaries that provide control in one-dimension. These boundaries are connected to an array of anti-parallel diodes to introduce simultaneous nonlinear damping and stiffness effects that break the reciprocity of energy flow through the NAMM cell. A finite element model of the NAMM cell is developed to investigate the nonreciprocal characteristics of the cell by optimizing the parameters that influence the nonlinear damping and stiffness effects introduced by the diodes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NAMM in tuning the directivity, flow, and distribution of acoustic energy propagating though the metamaterial.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2020-08-06", "authors": ["KPetrover", "ABaz"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0001625"}

{"title": "Modeling of a Passive-Valve Piezoelectric Micro-Pump: A Parametric Study.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric micro-pumps offer many applications and could provide considerable flow rates in miniature systems. This study parametrically investigates the effects of major parameters, namely the length, width and attack angle of valves, piezoelectric length, and applied voltage. The results show that these parameters significantly affect the performance of the designed micro-pump. Even though increasing the piezoelectric length and operating voltage raise the flow rate, the modification of valve dimensions is more efficient since these parameters do not rely on any external power. According to the obtained results, as the length of the working valves increases, the provided flow rate becomes larger. There is an optimum condition for the width and attack angle of the valves. This optimum width is not dependent on the flow rate. With the use of the attack angle and the length of the valves as design parameters, the studied design shows promising results.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-08-06", "authors": ["AkamAboubakri", "Vahid EbrahimpourAhmadi", "AliKo\u015far"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11080752\n10.1007/s00542-018-3987-y\n10.1016/j.snb.2020.128503\n10.3390/mi11040412\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2019.04.009\n10.1016/j.mee.2018.04.008\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2014.06.037\n10.1007/s10404-012-1008-5\n10.1007/s10404-014-1442-7\n10.1246/cl.170217\n10.1007/s42558-019-0005-1\n10.1007/s00542-020-04786-w\n10.3390/mi10040259\n10.1088/1361-6439/ab3278\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919691\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.02.038\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.026\n10.3390/ijms12063648\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.402\n10.1016/0250-6874(88)87005-7\n10.1016/0250-6874(89)87114-8\n10.1016/0924-4247(94)00960-P\n10.1088/0960-1317/12/4/313\n10.1007/s11741-007-0114-1\n10.1016/j.mee.2007.12.013\n10.1177/1045389X04039730\n10.1177/104538901400438037\n10.1016/0924-4247(96)80088-4\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00077-1"}

This paper is to analyze several secondary resonances of a cantilever-type piezoelectric energy harvester with a tip magnet. The conventional Galerkin method is improved to truncate the continuous model, an integro-partial differential equation with time-dependent boundary conditions. Then, more resonances on higher-order vibration modes can be obtained. The stable steady-state response is formulated approximately but analytically for the first two subharmonic and combination resonances. The instability boundaries are discussed for these secondary resonances from quadratic nonlinearity. A small damping and a large excitation readily result in an unstable response, including the period-doubling and quasiperiodic motions that can be employed to enhance the voltage output around a wider band of working frequency.

{"title": "Research on Inlet and Outlet Structure Optimization to Improve the Performance of Piezoelectric Pump.", "abstract": "As piezoelectric pumps are used in more fields, they are gradually failing to meet the application requirements due to their low output performance. Therefore, improving the output performance of piezoelectric pumps helps to expand their applications. This paper argued that the dynamic load of liquid in the inlet and outlet pipelines was an important factor that weakened the performance of piezoelectric pumps. Therefore, in order to reduce the dynamic load, it was proposed to replace the conventional piezoelectric pump inlet and outlet by an elastic inlet and outlet. After introducing the structure and working principle of elastic inlet and outlet, the mechanism of reducing the dynamic load by elastic inlet and outlet was analyzed. Then, the influence of the elastic cavity height on the performance of the piezoelectric pump was studied from both fluid simulation and theoretical analysis. Finally, several prototypes were made. The effectiveness of the elastic inlet and outlet on improving the performance of the prototype and the effect of the elastic cavity height on the performance of the prototype were tested, respectively. The test results showed that the elastic inlet and outlet effectively improved the flow rate and output backpressure without increasing the maximum output backpressure.

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their nonuniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging.

{"title": "Highly stretchable sensing array for independent detection of pressure and strain exploiting structural and resistive control.", "abstract": "Stretchable physical sensors are crucial for the development of advanced electrical systems, particularly wearable devices and soft robotics. Currently available stretchable sensors that detect both pressure and strain are based on piezoelectric, piezoresistive, or piezocapacitive effects. The range of pressure sensing is 1-800\u00a0kPa with large deformations being within the range of deformations of parts of the human body, such as elbows and knees. However, these devices cannot easily allow simultaneous and independent detection of pressure and strain with sensor arrays at large tensions (>\u200950%) because strain affects the pressure signal. In this study, we propose a monolithic silicone-based array of pressure and strain sensors that can simultaneously and independently detect the in-plane biaxial tensile deformation and pressure. To realize these functionalities, the deformation of the device structure was optimized using a hetero-silicone substrate made of two types of silicone with different hardness characteristics and porous silicone bodies. In addition, the resistances of the sensors were controlled by adjusting a mixture based on carbon nanoparticles to improve the sensitivity and independence between the pressure and strain sensors.

Here, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors consist in one-port synchronous resonators, based on the Pt/AlN/Sapphire structure and operating in the 2.45-GHz Industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. Experimental characterizations were carried out using a specific probe station that can perform calibrated measurements from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C.

{"title": "Wireless Ultrasound Surgical System with Enhanced Power and Amplitude Performances.", "abstract": "A wireless ultrasound surgical system (WUSS) with battery modules requires efficient power consumption with appropriate cutting effects during surgical operations. Effective cutting performances of the ultrasound transducer (UT) should be produced for ultrasound surgical knives for effective hemostasis performance and efficient dissection time. Therefore, we implemented a custom-made UT with piezoelectric material and re-poling process, which is applied to enhance the battery power consumption and output amplitude performances of the WUSS. After the re-poling process of the UT, the quality factor increased from 1231.1 to 2418 to minimize the unwanted heat generation. To support this UT, we also developed a custom-made generator with a transformer and developed 2nd harmonic termination circuit, control microcontroller with an advanced reduced instruction set computer machine (ARM) controller, and battery management system modules to produce effective WUSS performances. The generator with a matching circuit in the WUSS showed a peak-to-peak output voltage and current amplitude of 166 V and 1.12 A, respectively, at the resonant frequency. The performance with non-contact optical vibrators was also measured. In the experimental data, the developed WUSS reduced power consumption by 3.6% and increased the amplitude by 20% compared to those of the commercial WUSS. Therefore, the improved WUSS performances could be beneficial for hemostatic performance and dissection time during surgical operation because of the developed UT with a piezoelectric material and re-poling process.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-31", "authors": ["JungsukKim", "KiheumYou", "Sun-HoChoe", "HojongChoi"], "doi": "10.3390/s20154165\n10.3390/s18103324\n10.1109/TBME.2018.2821201\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2631224\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.106865\n10.3390/s19040898\n10.3390/s19245427\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2355\n10.3390/s18124248\n10.1177/0954406219892750\n10.1088/1757-899X/815/1/012014\n10.3390/s19020357\n10.3390/s20113059\n10.1121/1.4919318\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2014.06.001\n10.3233/BME-130921\n10.3390/s17040764\n10.3390/s19235252\n10.1016/S0921-5093(97)00806-X\n10.3390/s19020287\n10.3390/mi10100697\n10.3390/s18124210\n10.3390/s17102425\n10.3390/math7080752\n10.1016/j.measurement.2016.10.053\n10.1155/2017/6580217\n10.3390/s20010290\n10.3390/en13112986\n10.3390/app7040354\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.111616\n10.3390/app9112350\n10.3390/s20082273"}

This harvester can achieve a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) plunge-pitch motions. Several prototypes of energy harvester were fabricated to explore the nonlinear aerodynamic response and the output performance in a wind tunnel. The experimental results showed that the longer the flexible spring was, the lower the critical velocity and frequency of the harvester were, and the better aerodynamic response and output performance could be achieved. The initial disturbance, the following limit-cycle oscillation, and the ultimate chaos of nonlinear response occurred, as increasing airflow velocity was increased. The overall output performance of the harvesters with a flexible spring having a thickness of 1 mm outperformed than that of the harvesters with a flexible spring having a thickness of 0.5 mm at a higher airflow velocity, while the tendency was opposite at a lower velocity. An optimum output voltage of 17.48 V and a power of 0.764 mW were harvested for EH-160-1 at 16.32 m/s, which demonstrated it possessed better performance than the other harvesters.

{"title": "100\u00a0MHz bandwidth planar laser-generated ultrasound source for hydrophone calibration.", "abstract": "High-frequency calibration of hydrophones is becoming increasingly important, both for clinical and scientific applications of ultrasound, and user safety. At present, the calibrations available routinely to the user community extend to 60\u00a0MHz. However, hydrophones that can measure beyond this are available, and ultrasonic fields often contain energy at higher frequencies, e.g., generated through nonlinear propagation of high-amplitude ultrasound used for therapeutic applications, and the increasing use of higher frequencies in imaging. Therefore, there is a need for calibrations up to at least 100\u00a0MHz, to allow ultrasonic fields to be accurately characterized, and the risk of harmful bioeffects to be properly assessed. Currently, sets of focused piezoelectric transducers are used to meet the pressure amplitude and bandwidth requirements of Primary Standard calibration facilities. However, when the frequency is high enough such that the size of the ultrasound focus becomes less than the hydrophone element's diameter, the uncertainty due to spatial averaging becomes significant, and can be as high as 20% at 100\u00a0MHz. As an alternate to piezoelectric transducers, a laser-generated ultrasound calibration source was designed, fabricated, and characterized. The source consists of an optically absorbing carbon-polymer nanocomposite excited by a large-diameter 1064\u00a0nm laser pulse of 2.6\u00a0ns duration.

{"title": "Amphipathic Janus Membrane with Hierarchical Multiscale Hyperporous Structure for Interfacial Catalysis.", "abstract": "The rational design and realization of multiscale porous structures has been a long-standing challenge in membrane science. Block copolymers (BCPs) with their self-assembly-enabled nanodomains have the potential to make structural breakthroughs. An amphipathic Janus membrane, with a hierarchical multiscale hyperporous structure constituted by polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS4VP) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) blocks, was designed and synthesized in this work. Hydrophobic PVDF dominated one side of the membrane, and hydrophilic PS4VP, with nanopores that formed inside the macroporous channels of PVDF via a self-assembly approach, dominated the other side. Candida Rugosa Lipase (CRL), as a model biocatalyst, was immobilized in the PS4VP nanopores via injection. The immobilized lipase was exactly suspended at the interface of the organic and aqueous phases, owing to the amphipathic property of the Janus membrane. The designed structures and catalysis performances were further characterized. The immobilized lipase exhibited a three times higher specific activity than free lipase, and the relative activity still remained above 90% after 10 cycles of reusing, indicating the observable promotion and the guaranteed stability of the Janus membrane in interfacial catalysis.

{"title": "Inhibition of NADPH oxidase alleviates germ cell apoptosis and ER stress during testicular ischemia reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Testicular torsion and detorsion (TTD) is a serious urological condition affecting young males that is underlined by an ischemia reperfusion injury (tIRI) to the testis as the pathophysiological mechanism. During tIRI, uncontrolled production of oxygen reactive species (ROS) causes DNA damage leading to germ cell apoptosis (GCA). The aim of the study is to explore whether inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX), a major source of intracellular ROS, will prevent tIRI-induced GCA and its association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a036) were divided into three groups: sham, tIRI only and tIRI treated with apocynin (a NOX inhibitor). Rats undergoing tIRI endured an ischemic injury for 1\u00a0h followed by 4\u00a0h of reperfusion. Spermatogenic damage was evaluated histologically, while cellular damages were assessed using real time PCR, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and biochemical assays. Disrupted spermatogenesis was associated with increased lipid and protein peroxidation and decreased antioxidant activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) as a result of tIRI. In addition, increased DNA double strand breaks and formation of 8-OHdG adducts associated with increased phosphorylation of the DNA damage response (DDR) protein H2AX. The ASK1/JNK apoptosis signaling pathway was also activated in response to tIRI. Finally, increased immuno-expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) downstream targets: GRP78, eIF2-\u03b11, CHOP and caspase 12 supported the presence of ER stress. Inhibition of NOX by apocynin protected against tIRI-induced GCA and ER stress. In conclusion, NOX inhibition minimized tIRI-induced intracellular oxidative damages leading to GCA and ER stress.", "journal": "Saudi journal of biological sciences", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["FarahAl-Saleh", "FarahKhashab", "FatemahFadel", "NoraAl-Kandari", "MayAl-Maghrebi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.04.024\n10.1016/s0015-0282(02)04948-8\n10.1186/1471-2199-8-29\n10.1016/j.nano.2011.04.011\n10.10371/RD03089\n10.3390/molecules24183333\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.012\n10.7717/peerj.2195\n10.1155/2018/4946289\n10.7860/JCDR/2017/23927.9886\n10.1016/j.coi.2003.12.001\n10.1186/1477-7827-3-67\n10.1095/biolreprod.104.027748\n10.1038/nature01368\n10.1074/jbc.M103034200\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.09.007\n10.1152/physrev.00044.2005\n10.1155/2019/8535163\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.10824\n10.1016/j.trsl.2011.02.002\n10.1159/000442254\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.04.013\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.06.027\n10.1186/s12974-016-0478-x\n10.1074/jbc.275.18.13986\n10.3892/mmr.2016.5678\n10.3892/br.2017.948\n10.1016/j.neuint.2018.12.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088024\n10.1007/s10495-016-1247-0\n10.3390/ijms18040792\n10.1093/glycob/cwr023\n10.1016/j.molcel.2004.08.025\n10.1515/BC.2007.023\n10.1007/s11356-018-1950-1\n10.1007/s11010-014-2073-8\n10.1093/toxsci/kfr232\n10.1038/cddis.2011.134\n10.5534/wjmh.190038\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.032\n10.1111/1440-1681.13050\n10.1152/physiol.00050.2006\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.03.027\n10.1089/ars.2013.5605\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.02.037\n10.1083/jcb.201006121\n10.7669/j.issn.1001-7844.2016.01.0051\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2007.09.003\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.05.013\n10.1126/science.1140321\n10.4161/cc.8.6.7900\n10.3390/ijms19113679\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.04.001\n10.1095/biolreprod.114.127647\n10.1074/jbc.M204973200\n10.1074/jbc.M204973200\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.04.547\n10.1007/s12640-009-9110-5\n10.1101/gad.992302\n10.1096/fj.14-262527\n10.1038/bjc.2013.40\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.01.034\n10.1016/j.jid.2016.12.027\n10.1038/nrm2199\n10.1089/ars.2009.2625\n10.1089/ars.2013.5262\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2009.12.005\n10.1155/2008/106507\n10.3892/etm.2017.4090\n10.1016/j.etp.2013.03.002\n10.1038/sj.embor.7400779\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.103200\n10.1126/science.287.5453.664\n10.1177/0267659114559260\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.031\n10.1111/j.1365-2605.2004.00467.x\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.12.010\n10.1016/j.juro.2009.05.005\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2012.12.002\n10.1007/s00210-015-1125-2\n10.1007/s10495-016-1217-6"}

Group 1 was implanted with the Osia\u00ae, and group 2 was implanted with the Baha\u00ae Attract. The details of the surgery were analyzed, along with the functional and audiological results.\nIn all the cases, the surgery was successful, and the healing uneventful. In both groups, it was observed that pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry in free field improved significantly after the implantation (mean gain in pure tone audiometry for the Osia group 42.8\u202fdB SPL and for the Baha group 38.8\u202fdB SPL). In the Osia group, the results after the surgery were much better than with the Baha\u00ae 5 Power processor on the Softband. The patients implanted with the Osia\u00ae evaluated the quality of their hearing as being superior to those implanted with the Baha\u00ae Attract. There was an evident improvement in the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit questionnaire and in the speech, spatial and qualities of hearing scale for both systems. In the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit, changes were more evident in the Osia group (in global score 49% vs. 37.2%).\nImplantation of the Osia\u00ae is an effective treatment option for the patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss.

{"title": "Listening to pulses of radiation: design of a submersible thermoacoustic sensor.", "abstract": "Nowadays, various collaborations are creating immense machines to try to track and understand the origin of high-energy cosmic particles (e.g., IceCube, ANTARES, Baikal-GVD, P-ONE). The detection mechanism of these sophisticated experiments relies mainly on an optical signal generated by the passage of charged particles on a dielectric medium (\u010cerenkov radiation). Unfortunately, the dim light produced by passing particles cannot travel too far until it fades away, creating the necessity to instrument large areas with short spacing between sensors. The range limitation of the optical technique has created a fertile ground for experimenting on the detection of acoustic signals generated by radiation-thermoacoustics. Despite the increased use of the thermoacoustic technique, the instrumentation to capture the faint acoustic signals is still scarce. Therefore, this work has the objective to contribute with information on the critical stages of an affordable submersible thermoacoustic sensor: namely the piezoelectric transducer and the amplifying electronics. We tested the sensor in a [Formula: see text] non-anechoic tank using an infrared ([Formula: see text]) Q-switched Nd:YAG laser as a pulsed energy source to create the characteristic signals of the thermoacoustic phenomena. In accordance with the thermoacoustic model, a polarity inversion of the pressure signal was observed when transiting from temperatures below the point of maximum density of water to temperatures above it. Also, the amplitude of the acoustic signal displayed a linear relationship with pulse energies up to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Despite the use of cost-effective parts and simple construction methods, the proposed sensor design is a viable instrument for experimental thermoacoustic investigations on high-energy particles.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["RafaelBarmak", "GeraldoCernicchiaro"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-68954-8\n10.1007/BF01480076\n10.1016/0029-554X(79)90244-1\n10.1103/PhysRevD.19.3293\n10.1016/S0920-5632(03)01337-9\n10.1103/PhysRev.52.378\n10.1364/AO.20.000177\n10.1016/S0168-9002(01)02194-5\n10.1029/2005JD006687\n10.1016/j.nima.2005.09.035\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.2802\n10.1016/j.ppnp.2016.12.002\n10.1016/j.astropartphys.2006.06.005\n10.3189/172756505781829467\n10.1016/j.astropartphys.2010.10.003\n10.1016/j.nima.2010.09.053\n10.5162/sensor2015/E6.3\n10.1016/0925-4005(95)01704-6\n10.1117/1.3247155\n10.1088/1742-6596/680/1/012010\n10.1364/OL.386173\n10.1121/1.425549\n10.1121/1.1907352\n10.1103/RevModPhys.58.381\n10.1007/s10765-014-1715-0\n10.1103/PhysRev.32.97\n10.1121/1.381464\n10.1121/1.1909155\n10.1121/1.385958\n10.1121/1.382132\n10.1016/j.astropartphys.2014.12.003\n10.1121/1.427087\n10.6028/jres.059.028"}

An analytical expression of the deflection of a simply supported cross-ply composite laminate induced by distributed piezoelectric actuators was derived on the basis of classical plate theory and composite mechanics. The theoretical solution can be used to predict the deformation of the composite laminate. Series of parametric studies were performed to investigate the effects of location, size, and embedded depth of PZT actuators on the composite laminate deformation. The analytical predictions were verified with finite element results. A close agreement was achieved.

{"title": "Surface Treatment of Carbon Nanotubes Using Modified Tapioca Starch for Improved Force Detection Consistency in Smart Cementitious Materials.", "abstract": "The remarkable mechanical properties and piezo-responses of carbon nanotubes (CNT) makes this group of nanomaterials an ideal candidate for use in smart cementitious materials to monitor forces and the corresponding structural health conditions of civil structures. However, the inconsistency in measurements is the major challenge of CNT-enabled smart cementitious materials to be widely applied for force detection. In this study, the modified tapioca starch co-polymer is introduced to surface treat the CNTs for a better dispersion of CNTs; thus, to reduce the inconsistency of force measurements of the CNTs modified smart cementitious materials. Cement mortar with bare (unmodified) CNTs (direct mixing method) and surfactant surface treated CNTs using sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (NaDDBS) were used as the control. The experimental results showed that when compared with samples made from bare CNTs, the samples made by modified tapioca starch co-polymer coated CNTs (CCNTs) showed higher dynamic load induced piezo-responses with significantly improved consistency and less hysteresis in the cementitious materials. When compared with the samples prepared with the surfactant method, the samples made by the developed CCNTs showed slightly increased force detection sensitivity with significantly improved consistency in piezo-response and only minor hysteresis, indicating enhanced dispersion effectiveness. The new CNT surface coating method can be scaled up easily to cater the potential industry needs for future wide application of smart cementitious materials.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["LeonardChia", "GinaBlazanin", "YingHuang", "Umma SalmaRashid", "PanLu", "SenaySimsek", "AchintyaN Bezbaruah"], "doi": "10.3390/s20143985\n10.1177/0021998305053458\n10.1023/A:1022636512843\n10.1038/354056a0\n10.1126/science.1060928\n10.1016/j.carbon.2010.09.051\n10.1109/MEI.2004.1318850\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.07.232\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.05.018\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2014.07.003\n10.1177/0021998311401114\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/5/055010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.06.007\n10.1080/03602559.2010.496405\n10.1590/S1516-14392012005000077\n10.1155/2013/710175\n10.3141/2142-13\n10.1021/acs.est.6b04280\n10.1021/es3000239\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2010.02.015\n10.1002/pssa.200824310\n10.1021/nl025924u\n10.1063/1.5105380\n10.1016/j.jcis.2010.12.052\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2011.09.013\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2017.06.009\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2006.12.011\n10.1016/j.carbon.2004.12.017\n10.1680/adcr.2008.20.2.65\n10.1007/s42452-019-1364-9\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.10.011\n10.5772/979\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.07.053\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.06.011"}

{"title": "Impacts of Residual Stress on Micro Vibratory Platform Used for Inertial Sensor Calibration.", "abstract": "A micro vibratory platform driven by converse piezoelectric effects is a promising in-situ recalibration platform to eliminate the influence of bias and scale factor drift caused by long-term storage of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors. The calibration accuracy is critically determined by the stable and repeatable vibration of platform, and it is unavoidably impacted by the residual stress of micro structures and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) hysteresis. The abnormal phenomenon of the observed displacement response in experiments was investigated analytically using the stiffness model of beams and hysteresis model of piezoelectric material. Rather than the hysteresis, the initial deflection formed by the residual stress of the beam was identified as the main cause of the response error around the zero position. This conclusion provides guidelines to improve the performance and control of micro vibratory platforms.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["RuiHao", "HuijunYu", "BeiPeng", "HaixiangZhan", "WuZhou"], "doi": "10.3390/s20143959\n10.3390/s18020643\n10.3390/ma10091077\n10.1155/2014/373172\n10.1134/S2075108712040037\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/4/045022\n10.1016/S0924-4247(02)00023-7\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.12.045\n10.1109/TMTT.2005.857336\n10.3390/s18072055\n10.1088/0031-8949/2007/T129/042\n10.1063/1.1144892\n10.1109/TIE.2019.2962414\n10.1117/1.JMM.19.1.015002\n10.1063/1.1478137\n10.1007/s00542-016-2940-1\n10.1007/s10854-013-1598-z\n10.1109/84.809069\n10.1016/S0924-4247(98)00161-7\n10.3934/dcdss.2013.6.101\n10.1109/TMECH.2010.2052366\n10.1016/0022-460X(88)90412-9\n10.1115/1.2907372\n10.1063/1.2363143"}
{"title": "Durability and Strength Characteristics of Casein-Cemented Sand with Slag.", "abstract": "Casein is often used as an eco-friendly wood adhesive. In this study, we used casein for soil cementation by mixing it with Jumunjin sand, sodium hydroxide (SH), and calcium hydroxide (CH) as a standard casein formula. The modified casein binder with different proportions of SH and CH was applied to improve water resistance. Furthermore, a blast furnace slag (BFS) was additionally mixed and reacted with alkalinity of modified casein binder. Thus, three types (standard, modified, and modified + BFS, referred to as STD, MOD, and MBS, hereafter) of casein binders were tested for durability and strength of casein-cemented sand. A piezoelectric sensor was installed within each sample to determine the curing time of the casein-cemented samples. The samples were air-cured at room temperature for seven days and some were repeatedly immersed in water thrice. Unconfined compression and jar slake tests were carried out to evaluate the strength and durability of the casein-cemented sand. Also, the microstructure was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). We observed variations of peak conductance and corresponding frequency converged as the curing time increased. It was most significant for the MBS samples, which developed strength early. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the air-cured samples was higher than those repeatedly immersed in water due to wash-off of the casein binder. The UCS of the dry MBS sample was 9900 kPa while that of the immersed sample was 430 kPa, which gradually decreased to 60 kPa upon repeated immersion. The samples with STD and MOD had no resistance to durability and showed cracks on the surface, while the MBS sample exhibited significantly improved durability and no cracks. We found that the MBS binder had a positively significant effect on the durability and strength of casein-cemented sand.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-28", "authors": ["Sung-SikPark", "Seung-WookWoo", "Sueng-WonJeong", "Dong-EunLee"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13143182\n10.12989/gae.2015.8.1.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.10.026\n10.1007/s12517-016-2366-1\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002064\n10.1016/j.clay.2015.07.007\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001029\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.11.009\n10.1017/S0022029900017040\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002838\n10.1023/A:1004742027117\n10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.05.012\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03623.x\n10.1016/j.powtec.2013.04.037\n10.1016/S0008-8846(99)00028-9\n10.5345/JKIBC.2016.16.5.389\n10.7843/kgs.2018.34.2.33\n10.2113/gseegeosci.IV.3.385\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.07.017\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0003318"}
{"title": "A Review of Acoustic Impedance Matching Techniques for Piezoelectric Sensors and Transducers.", "abstract": "The coupling of waves between the piezoelectric generators, detectors, and propagating media is challenging due to mismatch in the acoustic properties. The mismatch leads to the reverberation of waves within the transducer, heating, low signal-to-noise ratio, and signal distortion. Acoustic impedance matching increases the coupling largely. This article presents standard methods to match the acoustic impedance of the piezoelectric sensors, actuators, and transducers with the surrounding wave propagation media. Acoustic matching methods utilizing active and passive materials have been discussed. Special materials such as nanocomposites, metamaterials, and metasurfaces as emerging materials have been presented. Emphasis is placed throughout the article to differentiate the difference between electric and acoustic impedance matching and the relation between the two.

{"title": "Effect of carbon doping on electromechanical response of boron nitride nanosheets.", "abstract": "The electromechanical response of hexagonal-boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNSs) was studied via molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) with a three-body Tersoff potential force field using a charge-dipole (C-D) potential model. Carbon (C)-doped h-BNSs with triangular, trapezoidal and circular pores were considered. The elastic and piezoelectric coefficients of h-BNSs under tension and shear loading conditions were determined. The induced polarization in h-BNSs was found to depend on the local arrangement of C atoms around B and N atoms, and the polarization increases if C atoms are surrounded by N atoms. This is attributed to the generation of higher dipole moments due to C-N bonds compared with C-B bonds. At \u223c5.5% C-doping concentration, the axial piezoelectric coefficient of doped h-BNSs with triangular and trapezoidal pores increased by 18.5% and 3.5%, respectively, while it reduced by 22.5% in the case of circular pores compared to pristine h-BNS. The shear piezoelectric coefficient of C-doped h-BNSs with triangular and trapezoidal pores increased by 20.5% and 1%, respectively, while it reduced by 7% in case of circular pores. Young's moduli of C-doped h-BNSs with triangular, trapezoidal and circular pores increased by 9%, 7.5% and 5.5%, respectively, due to the C-C bonds being stronger than all other bonds. The respective improvements in shear moduli are 8.5%, 5% and 5%. The elastic and piezoelectric properties of armchair h-BNSs were found to be higher than zigzag h-BNSs. The results also reveal that the piezoelectric coefficient increases as doping increases; it reaches its maximum value around 0.41 C m", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2020-07-25", "authors": ["S IKundalwal", "V KChoyal", "NitinLuhadiya", "VijayChoyal"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab9d43"}

Electrically powered nonferromagnetic motors based on piezoelectric elements have shown to be well suited for MRI robots. However, even avoiding ferrous materials, the high metal content on commercially available motors still cause distortions to the magnetic fields. We construct semicustom piezoelectric actuators wherein the quantity of conductive material is minimized and demonstrate that the distortion issues can be partly addressed through substituting several of these components for plastic equivalents, while maintaining motor functionality. Distortion was measured by assessing the root-mean-squared (RMS) change in position of 49 centroid points in a 12.5 mm square grid of a gelatin-filled phantom. The metal motor caused a distortion of up to 4.91 mm versus 0.55 mm for the plastic motor. An additional signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) drop between motor off and motor spinning of approximately 20% was not statistically different for metal versus plastic (p = 0.36).", "journal": "Journal of engineering and science in medical diagnostics and therapy", "date": "2020-07-25", "authors": ["Paulo A W GCarvalho", "Christopher JNycz", "Katie YGandomi", "Gregory SFischer"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4044609"}

{"title": "Structural mechanism for gating of a eukaryotic mechanosensitive channel of small conductance.", "abstract": "Mechanosensitive ion channels transduce physical force into electrochemical signaling that underlies an array of fundamental physiological processes, including hearing, touch, proprioception, osmoregulation, and morphogenesis. The mechanosensitive channels of small conductance (MscS) constitute a remarkably diverse superfamily of channels critical for management of osmotic pressure. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of a MscS homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, MSL1, presumably in both the closed and open states. The heptameric MSL1 channel contains an unusual bowl-shaped transmembrane region, which is reminiscent of the evolutionarily and architecturally unrelated mechanosensitive Piezo channels. Upon channel opening, the curved transmembrane domain of MSL1 flattens and expands. Our structures, in combination with functional analyses, delineate a structural mechanism by which mechanosensitive channels open under increased membrane tension. Further, the shared structural feature between unrelated channels suggests the possibility of a unified mechanical gating mechanism stemming from membrane deformation induced by a non-planar transmembrane domain.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2020-07-25", "authors": ["ZengqinDeng", "GrigoryMaksaev", "Angela MSchlegel", "JingyingZhang", "MichaelRau", "James A JFitzpatrick", "Elizabeth SHaswell", "PengYuan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-17538-1"}
{"title": "An active mechanical Willis meta-layer with asymmetric polarizabilities.", "abstract": "Willis materials exhibit macroscopic cross-coupling between particle velocity and stress as well as momentum and strain. However, Willis coupling coefficients designed so far are intrinsically coupled, which inhibits their full implementation in structural dynamic applications. This work presents a means to eliminate these limitations by introducing an active scatterer in a mechanical meta-layer that exploits piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs controlled by digital circuits. We experimentally demonstrate abilities of the Willis meta-layer, in beams and plates, for independently engineering transmission and reflection coefficients of flexural waves in both amplitude and phase and nonreciprocal wave propagations.

{"title": "Electrically programmable probabilistic bit anti-correlator on a nanomagnetic platform.", "abstract": "Execution of\u00a0probabilistic computing algorithms require electrically programmable stochasticity to encode arbitrary probability functions and controlled stochastic interaction or correlation between probabilistic (p-) bits. The latter is implemented with complex electronic components leaving a large footprint on a chip and dissipating excessive amount of energy. Here, we show an elegant implementation with just two dipole-coupled magneto-tunneling junctions (MTJ), with magnetostrictive soft layers, fabricated on a piezoelectric film. The resistance states of the two MTJs (high or low) encode the p-bit values (1 or 0) in the two streams. The first MTJ is driven to a resistance state with desired probability via a current or voltage that generates spin transfer torque, while the second MTJ's resistance state is determined by dipole coupling with the first, thus correlating the second p-bit stream with the first. The effect of dipole coupling can be varied by generating local strain in the soft layer of the second MTJ with a local voltage (~\u20090.2\u00a0V) and that varies the degree of anti-correlation between the resistance states of the two MTJs and hence between the two streams (from 0 to 100%). This paradigm generates the anti-correlation with \"wireless\" dipole coupling that consumes no footprint on a chip and dissipates no energy, and it controls the degree of anti-correlation with electrically generated strain that consumes minimal footprint and is extremely frugal in its use of energy. It can be extended to arbitrary number of bit streams. This realizes an \"all-magnetic\" platform for generating correlations or anti-correlations for probabilistic computing. It also implements a simple 2-node Bayesian network.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-07-25", "authors": ["Mason TMcCray", "Md AhsanulAbeed", "SupriyoBandyopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-68996-y\n10.1063/1.5055860\n10.1038/s41586-019-1557-9\n10.1038/srep44370\n10.1038/s41467-018-03963-w\n10.1109/LED.2018.2889881\n10.1145/2465787.2465794\n10.1063/1.4838216\n10.1063/1.4896549\n10.1126/science.1207186\n10.1038/nnano.2015.24\n10.1109/LED.2010.2082487\n10.1063/1.4761250\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-396X(199805)167:1<195::AID-PSSA195>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1177/1045389X07077854\n10.1063/1.3466906\n10.1109/LMAG.2019.2956913\n10.1109/TCAD.2017.2778107\n10.1109/TC.2010.202\n10.1109/MC.2015.367\n10.1109/TNANO.2015.2439618\n10.1038/srep29893"}

{"title": "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Represents an Anti-Inflammatory Therapy Via Reduction of Shear Stress-Induced, Piezo-1-Mediated Monocyte Activation.", "abstract": "Aortic valve stenosis is an increasingly prevalent degenerative and inflammatory disease. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized its treatment, thereby avoiding its life-threatening/disabling consequences. Whether aortic valve stenosis is accelerated by inflammation and whether it is itself a cause of inflammation are unclear. We hypothesized that the large shear forces exerted on circulating cells, particularly on the largest circulating cells, monocytes, while passing through stenotic aortic valves result in proinflammatory effects that are resolved with TAVI.\nTAVI provides a unique opportunity to compare the activation status of monocytes under high shear stress (before TAVI) and under low shear stress (after TAVI). The activation status of monocytes was determined with a single-chain antibody, MAN-1, which is specific for the activated \u03b2\nThe resolution of high shear stress through TAVI reduces Mac-1 activation, cellular adhesion, phagocytosis, oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake, and expression of inflammatory markers in monocytes and plasma. Using microfluidics and pharmacological and genetic studies, we could recapitulate high shear stress effects on isolated human monocytes under highly controlled conditions, showing that shear stress-dependent calcium influx and monocyte adhesion are mediated by the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo-1. We also demonstrate that the expression of this receptor is shear stress dependent and downregulated in patients receiving TAVI. Last, we show monocyte accumulation at the aortic side of leaflets of explanted aortic valves.\nWe demonstrate that high shear stress, as present in patients with aortic valve stenosis, activates multiple monocyte functions, and we identify Piezo-1 as the mainly responsible mechanoreceptor, representing a potentially druggable target.

Existing clinical techniques such as autografts, allografts, and newer nerve guidance conduits have shown variable outcomes in functional recovery, adverse immune responses, and in some cases low or minimal availability. This can be attributed in part to the lack of chemical, physical, and electrical cues directing both nerve guidance and regeneration. To address this pressing clinical issue, electrospun nanofibers and microfibers composed of piezoelectric polyvinylidene flouride-triflouroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) have been introduced as an alternative template for tissue engineered biomaterials, specifically as it pertains to their relevance in soft tissue and nerve repair. Here, biocompatible scaffolds of PVDF-TrFE are fabricated and their ability to generate an electrical response to mechanical deformations and produce a suitable regenerative microenvironment is examined. It is determined that 20% (w/v) PVDF-TrFE in (6:4) dimethyl formamide (DMF):acetone solvent maintains a desirable piezoelectric coefficient and the proper physical and electrical characteristics for tissue regeneration.

{"title": "Estimating the Effects of Awareness on Neck-Muscle Loading in Frontal Impacts with EMG and MC Sensors.", "abstract": "Critical traffic situations, such as vehicle collisions and emergency manoeuvres, can cause an occupant to respond with reflex and voluntary actions. These affect the occupant's position and dynamic loading during interactions with the vehicle's restraints, possibly compromising their protective function. Electromyography (EMG) is a commonly used method for measuring active muscle response and can also provide input parameters for computer simulations with models of the human body. The recently introduced muscle-contraction (MC) sensor is a wearable device with a piezo-resistive element for measuring the force of an indenting tip pressing against the surface of the body. The study aimed to compare how data collected simultaneously with EMG, video motion capture, and the novel MC sensor are related to neck-muscle loading. Sled tests with low-severity frontal impacts were conducted, assuming two different awareness conditions for seated volunteers. The activity of the upper trapezius muscle was measured using surface EMG and MC sensors. The neck-muscle load F was estimated from an inverse dynamics analysis of the head's motion captured in the sagittal plane. The volunteers' response to impact was predominantly reflexive, with significantly shorter onset latencies and more bracing observed when the volunteers were aware of the impact. Cross-correlations between the EMG and MC, EMG and F, and F and MC data were not changed significantly by the awareness conditions. The MC signal was strongly correlated (r = 0.89) with the neck-muscle loading F in the aware and unaware conditions, while the mean \u0394F-MC delays were 21.0 \u00b1 15.1 ms and 14.6 \u00b1 12.4 ms, respectively. With the MC sensor enabling a consistent measurement-based estimation of the muscle loading, the simultaneous acquisition of EMG and MC signals improves the assessment of the reflex and voluntary responses of a vehicle's occupant subjected to low-severity loading.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-19", "authors": ["SimonKra\u0161na", "Sr\u0111an\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107"], "doi": "10.3390/s20143942\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.109754\n10.1080/15389588.2019.1670818\n10.1016/S0149-7634(01)00057-4\n10.1016/j.jelekin.2013.06.010\n10.1007/s12206-016-1155-9\n10.1007/s00221-003-1466-9\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00289.x\n10.2298/JAC0201031A\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2014.07.021\n10.1007/s10439-011-0379-1\n10.1016/j.aap.2012.01.016\n10.1080/15389588.2016.1205190\n10.1016/S0268-0033(03)00137-2\n10.1080/13588265.2017.1301080\n10.1080/15389588.2015.1015000\n10.1080/15389588.2013.806795\n10.1080/15389588.2014.931949\n10.1123/jab.13.2.135\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181b46bdd\n10.1016/j.jelekin.2009.08.005\n10.1016/j.jelekin.2010.08.009\n10.1123/jab.20.4.367\n10.3390/s18041004\n10.3390/s111009411\n10.3390/s140917848\n10.3390/s17061389\n10.1016/0021-9290(94)00116-L\n10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181be9c7e\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177312\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.09.016\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.03.029\n10.1115/1.4023524\n10.22237/jmasm/1509496200\n10.1080/15389588.2014.938323\n10.1152/jn.00084.2018\n10.1115/1.4032966\n10.1152/jn.00183.2007\n10.1115/1.2401185\n10.1186/1471-2474-9-80\n10.1097/BRS.0000000000000721\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.109533\n10.1097/01.BRS.0000051911.45505.D3\n10.1007/s00221-010-2172-z\n10.1007/s00221-011-2986-3\n10.1016/j.neulet.2014.11.034\n10.1007/BF00705038\n10.2466/PMS.103.7.743-754\n10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.08.039\n10.1016/j.jmpt.2016.03.001\n10.1016/j.humov.2011.08.006\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00985\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.09.021"}

In this context, polymers based on PVDF can be used in the formation of thin P3HT films and present an alternative to improve the organization of P3HT molecules. In addition, PVDF acts as a plasticizer, making the film less rigid.

In the present study, 2D In2Se3 flakes down to monolayers are grown by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique on a mica substrate with their structural, optical and ferroelectric properties being studied. The effect of growth parameters (time of growth and Ar flow rate) on the shape and size of the deposited flakes was studied. The optical microscopy study revealed that the flake changed from a circular shape to a sharp face triangle as the Ar flow rate and growth time increased. Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) studies revealed that the flakes were of \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases, each of which has a hexagonal crystal structure. Strong second harmonic generation (SHG) was observed from \u03b1-In2Se3, demonstrating its non-centrosymmetric structure. The piezo-force microscopic (PFM) study showed the presence of out of plane (OOP) ferroelectricity with no in plane (IP) ferroelectricity in CVD grown \u03b1-In2Se3 indicating its vertically confined piezoresponse, which was tuned by the applied electric bias and the flake thickness.

{"title": "Non-targeted detection and differentiation of agonists versus antagonists, directly in bioprofiles of everyday products.", "abstract": "Xenoestrogens exert antiandrogenic effects on the human androgen receptor. In the analytical field, such antagonists block the detection of testosterone and falsify results obtained by sum parameter assays. Currently, such agonistic versus antagonistic effects are not differentiated in complex mixtures. Oppositely acting hormonal effects present in products of everyday use can only be differentiated after tedious fractionation and isolation of the individual compounds along with subjection of each fraction/compound to the status quo bioassay testing. However, such long-lasting procedures are not suited for routine. Hence, we developed a fast bioanalytical tool that figures out agonists versus antagonists directly in complex mixtures. Exemplarily, 8 cosmetics and 15 thermal papers were analyzed. The determined antagonistic potentials of active compounds found were comparable to the ones of known antagonists (in reference shown for bisphenol A, 4-n-nonylphenol and four parabens). Relevant biological/chromatographic parameters such as cell viability, culture conditions, dose response curves, limits of biological detection/quantification and working range (shown for testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, nandrolone and trenbolone) were investigated to obtain the best sensitivity of the biological detection. The developed and validated method was newly termed reversed phase high-performance thin-layer chromatography planar yeast ant-/agonistic androgen screen (RP-HPTLC-pYAAS bioassay). Results were also compared with the RP-HPTLC-Aliivibrio fischeri bioassay (applied on RP plates for the first time). As proof-of-concept, the transfer to another bioassay (RP-HPTLC-pYES) was successfully demonstrated, analogously termed RP-HPTLC-pYAES bioassay detecting anti-/estrogens (exemplarily shown for evaluation of 4 pharmaceuticals used in breast cancer treatment). The new imaging concept provides (1) detection and differentiation of individual agonistic versus antagonistic effects in the bioprofiles, (2) bioanalytical quantification of their activity potential by scanning densitometry and (3) characterization of unknown bioactive compound zones by hyphenation to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Depending on the hormonal bioassay, 15 samples were analyzed in parallel within 5\u00a0h or 6\u00a0h (calculated as 20 or 24\u00a0min per sample).

{"title": "Application of Novel Intraoperative Neuromonitoring System Using an Endotracheal Tube With Pressure Sensor During Thyroid Surgery: A Porcine Model Study.", "abstract": "The loss of signal during intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) using electromyography (EMG) in thyroidectomy is one of the biggest problems. We have developed a novel IONM system with an endotracheal tube (ETT) with an attached pressure sensor instead of EMG to detect laryngeal twitching. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and reliability of this novel IONM system using an ETT with pressure sensor during thyroidectomy in a porcine model.\nWe developed an ETT-attached pressure sensor that uses the piezoelectric effect to measure laryngeal muscle twitching. Stimulus thresholds, amplitude, and latency of laryngeal twitching evaluated using the pressure sensor were compared to those measured using transcartilage needle EMG. The measured amplitude changes by EMG and the pressure sensor during recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) traction injury were compared.\nNo significant differences in stimulus threshold intensity between EMG and the pressure sensor were observed. The EMG amplitude detected at 0.3 mA, increased with increasing stimulus intensity. When the stimulus was more than 1.0 mA, the amplitude showed a plateau. In a RLN traction injury experiment, the EMG amplitude did not recover even 20 minutes after stopping RLN traction. However, the pressure sensor showed a mostly recovery.\nThe change in amplitude due to stimulation of the pressure sensor showed a pattern similar to EMG. Pressure sensors can be feasibly and reliably used for RLN traction injury prediction, RLN identification, and preservation through the detection of laryngeal muscle twitching. Our novel IONM system that uses an ETT with an attached pressure sensor to measure the change of surface pressure can be an alternative to EMG in the future.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology", "date": "2020-07-17", "authors": ["Eui-SukSung", "Sung-ChanShin", "Hyun-KeunKwon", "JiaKim", "Da-HeePark", "Seong-WookChoi", "Sang-HoonKim", "Jin-ChoonLee", "Jung-HoonRo", "Byung-JooLee"], "doi": "10.21053/ceo.2019.01249"}

Based on the phenomenological theories of piezoelectric semiconductors and piezomagnetics, a one-dimensional model is developed from which an analytical solution is obtained. The explicit expressions of the coupled fields and the numerical results show that an axially applied magnetic field produces extensional deformation through piezomagnetic coupling, the extension then produces polarization through piezoelectric coupling, and the polarization then causes the redistribution of mobile charges. Thus, the composite rod exhibits a coupling between the applied magnetic field and carrier distribution through combined piezomagnetic and piezoelectric effects.

A piezoelectric transducer (PZT), peaked at 3.7 MHz, is used as an ultrasound generator. A steel plate with a silica taper attached is adhered to the PZT and is used as the ultrasound propagation medium. The transmission spectrum of the silica taper has high contrast owing to multimode interference in this twisted silica structure. Specially, the taper waist length and waist diameter are optimized for the highest optical sensitivity with high contrast at high slope in the transmission spectrum. The ultrasound sensitivity is characterized by a different thickness of the steel plate from 0 to 2.36 mm to achieve the highest ultrasound frequency response. With the taper waist length of 5 mm, waist diameter of 5 \u00b5m, and steel thickness of 0 mm, a broadband ultrasound frequency of 20 kHz to 94.4 MHz can be detected at high harmonics of the PZT, verifying the high sensitivity of the compact twisted silica taper.", "journal": "Optics letters", "date": "2020-07-16", "authors": ["HuiboFan", "WenwenMa", "LiangChen", "XiaoyiBao"], "doi": "10.1364/OL.397213"}

The modeled MC includes two electrode layers, a piezoelectric layer, and the geometric discontinuities as a result of these layers and the change in the MC cross section at the probe-MC contact point is modeled. The equations of motion are derived using Hamilton's principle and then discretized with the aid of the finite element method. The system frequency and time response in the free vibration mode when placed in a liquid medium are compared with experimental results. Also, the sample surface topography in the noncontact mode, when passing through the surface roughness, has been modeled as rectangular and wedge-shaped. Furthermore, the control of piezoelectric MC in two cases of near and far from the sample surface is examined. In the case of far from the surface, the system is controlled using the piezoelectric layer installed on the beam, whereas in the case of near the surface, the piezo is turned off due to the existence of nonlinear forces such as Van der Waals and Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov contact forces and the control is achieved through the base excitation. For system control modeling, the robust fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) approach is utilized and the results are compared with those of the simple sliding mode control (SMC) as well as proportional, integral, and derivative control. The presented FSMC approach can remarkably reduce the chattering phenomenon at the SMC input in the liquid medium and accordingly improve the results compared to the other two methods.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2020-07-16", "authors": ["Alireza HabibnejadKorayem", "PouyaGhasemi", "Moharam HabibnejadKorayem"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.23535"}

Within this study computational methods were applied to investigate the performance of zwitterionic moieties derived from three different anionic groups in the ZW head, specifically, carboxylate, sulfonate, and phosphate. This approach was used in addition to the inclusion of a linker between the ZW head and the PVDF backbone, such as trimethyl ammonium groups and hydroxyl group for an increase in PVDF membrane hydrophilicity.

{"title": "Antlions are sensitive to subnanometer amplitude vibrations carried by sand substrates.", "abstract": "The antlion larvae (Myrmeleontidae) are ambush predators. They detect substrate-borne vibrations induced by the movement of the prey. European pit-building antlions (Myrmeleon inconspicuus) are studied for their ability to perceive vibrations generated by the locomotion of an ant (Cataglyphis cursor) outside the pit. These strides have been recorded and copied in detail in their time sequences. The signal created was emitted by piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: the ant movements create waves with particle accelerations that are three orders of magnitude less than g, alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay between the start of the cue and the predatory behaviour induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. We found that antlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes of nanometer range, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m amplitude. This difference in latency is used to evidence the sensitivity to vibrations at an extremely low level.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

Yet, at the present time, it can only be achieved with SQUID technology. However, SQUID based BLS suffers high costs and cumbersome cryogenic requirements that prevent SQUID BLS from being adopted by clinical applications. Recently, we demonstrated that a single channel ME sensor with piezo-single crystals could detect LIC from only 3cc of mouse liver tissue without any magnetic field shielding. The results demonstrated not only the sensitivity of ME sensor system for LIC but also the feasibility for mapping LIC profiles spatially. This investigation further developed ME sensor arrays, exploiting the compact size and room temperature operation. A Dual-Channel 1-D ME sensor array along the vertical, Z-direction, was developed and shown to be sensitive to the skin-liver distance change which can be utilized to calibrate and eliminate the inter-subject variability of the LIC measurement due to skin-liver distance. With phantom having spatially dependent iron concentrations, the 1-D ME sensor array was capable of mapping the one-dimensional profile of the iron concentration in the horizontal X- and Y-directions.

It has been presented to create poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Tetrapod-shaped ZnO (T-ZnO)/enzyme-modified nanocomposite film through an efficient and cost-effective fabrication process. This sensor can be readily attached to the skin surface of the tester. Due to the piezoelectric surface coupling effect, this biosensor can monitor/sense and analyze physical information in real-time under the non-invasive condition and work independently without any battery. By actively outputting piezoelectric signals, it can quickly and sensitively detect body movements (changes of joint angle, frequency relative humidity during exercise) and physiological information (changes of lactate concentration in sweat). A practical application has been demonstrated by an excellent professional speed skater (male).

{"title": "Parallel Mechanosensory Pathways Direct Oviposition Decision-Making in Drosophila.", "abstract": "Female Drosophila choose their sites for oviposition with deliberation. Female flies employ sensitive chemosensory systems to evaluate chemical cues for egg-laying substrates, but how they determine the physical quality of an oviposition patch remains largely unexplored. Here we report that flies evaluate the stiffness of the substrate surface using sensory structures on their appendages. The TRPV family channel Nanchung is required for the detection of all stiffness ranges tested, whereas two other proteins, Inactive and DmPiezo, interact with Nanchung to sense certain spectral ranges of substrate stiffness differences. Furthermore, Tmc is critical for sensing subtle differences in substrate stiffness. The Tmc channel is expressed in distinct patterns on the labellum and legs and the mechanosensory inputs coordinate to direct the final decision making for egg laying. Our study thus reveals the machinery for deliberate egg-laying decision making in fruit flies to ensure optimal survival for their offspring.", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "date": "2020-07-11", "authors": ["LiweiZhang", "JieYu", "XuanGuo", "JianhuanWei", "TingLiu", "WeiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.076"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a piezo surgery, ultrasonic bone scalpel, or conventional bur used in Le Fort I osteotomy has an influence on PMS patterns.\nUsing a retrospective cohort study design, we enrolled a sample composed of patients who underwent orthognathic surgery. The primary predictor variables were the cutting instruments (ultrasonic bone scalpel, piezo surgery, and Lindeman bur) used to perform Le Fort I osteotomy. Other variables were demographic and anatomic parameters. The outcome variable was the type of PMS pattern, classified as follows: type 1, PMS at the pterygomaxillary junction (ideal PMS); type 2, PMS at the greater palatine foramen; type 3, PMS from the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus; and type 4, PMS with lateral or medial pterygoid fracture. Anatomic parameters, that is, the thickness and width of the pterygomaxillary junction and distance of the greater palatine foramen, were measured on preoperative cone-beam computed tomography images. The pattern of PMS was evaluated on postoperative cone-beam computed tomography. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and the Pearson \u03c7\nThis study sample was composed of 96 PMSs in 48 patients. The most common type of PMS was type 1 (58), followed by type 4 (21), type 2 (10), and type 3 (7). A statistically significant relation was found between the cutting instrument and the ideal separation (type 1 PMS) pattern (P\u00a0=\u00a0.032), and the highest rate of the ideal separation pattern was seen in the ultrasonic bone scalpel group, at 24 of 32, compared with 22 of 38 in the piezo surgery group and 12 of 26 in the conventional bur group.\nAccording to the study, the ultrasonic bone scalpel is safer than other cutting instruments in terms of the ideal separation of the pterygomaxillary junction.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2020-07-11", "authors": ["SuheybBilge", "Yusuf NuriKaba", "Ahmet EminDemirbas", "N\u00fckhetK\u00fct\u00fck", "ErdemKili\u00e7", "AlperAlkan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2020.06.003"}
{"title": "Superhydrophobic ZIF-8-Based Dual-Layer Coating for Enhanced Corrosion Protection of Mg Alloy.", "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are regarded as the most promising engineering materials because of their unique property. However, the Mg alloys were easily corroded in humid environments, which restricted their wider applications. Herein, the superhydrophobic ZIF-8/PVDF/LDH (SZPL) double-layered coating was fabricated on Mg alloys via electrodeposition and dip-coating methods, which consisted of the underlying layered double hydroxide (LDH) transition structure and top superhydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) layer. Besides, the LDH transition structure not only worked as a protection shield but also strengthened the binding force between the substrate and the top superhydrophobic ZIF-8 layer. The top superhydrophobic ZIF-8 layer could serve as an armor on the LDH layer to further prevent the corrosive ions from infiltrating the microporous defects. In addition, the as-prepared SZPL double-layered coating showed robust superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties, which could block the electrolyte invasion. Furthermore, the electrochemical tests demonstrated that the SZPL coating highly enhanced the corrosion protection ability of Mg alloys. Moreover, the superhydrophobic ZIF-8-based coating could still retain excellent anticorrosion property after immersion in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 7 days. The enhanced anticorrosion ability was ascribed to the fact that a synergistic effect of the underlying LDH transition layer hindered the transmission of aggressive ions and the top superhydrophobic ZIF-8-based coating decreased the contact area of the substrate with corrosive solution. Therefore, such coatings offer a new strategy for fabricating excellent anticorrosive coatings with robust superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning performance on metal substrates.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-07-11", "authors": ["XingxingYin", "PengMu", "QingtaoWang", "JianLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c09497"}
{"title": "Thermal display glove for interacting with virtual reality.", "abstract": "Thermal perception is essential for the survival and daily activities of people. Thus, it is desirable to realize thermal feedback stimulation for improving the sense of realism in virtual reality (VR) for users. For thermal stimulus, conventional systems utilize liquid circulation with bulky external sources or thermoelectric devices (TEDs) on rigid structures. However, these systems are difficult to apply to compact wearable gear used for complex hand motions to interact with VR. Furthermore, generating a rapid temperature difference, especially cooling, in response to a thermal stimulus in real-time is challenging for the conventional systems. To overcome this challenge and enhance wearability, we developed an untethered real-time thermal display glove. This glove comprised piezoelectric sensors enabling hand motion sensing and flexible TEDs for bidirectional thermal stimulus on skin. The customized flexible TEDs can decrease the temperature by 10\u00a0\u00b0C at room temperature in less than 0.5\u00a0s. Moreover, they have sufficiently high durability to withstand over 5,000 bends and high flexibility under a bending radius of 20\u00a0mm.

A higher mixing efficiency was reached when the direct-current (DC) power supply reached 20\u00a0V. Meanwhile, a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) driver was used in the mixing experiment with the paper-based zigzag microchannel. The results show that the mixing efficiency reached a maximum value when the input voltage and frequency were 30\u00a0V and 150\u00a0Hz, respectively. These paper-based devices meet the requirements of the biochemical analysis field because they are low cost, easy to operate, and have high efficiencies, giving them good prospects for future applications.

Complex cranial vault reconstruction is performed in children with craniosynostosis and is associated with extensive blood loss, potential life-threatening risks, and significant morbidity. In this preliminary study, we hypothesized that NIVA will provide a reliable, non-invasive, quantitative assessment of intravascular volume changes in children undergoing complex cranial vault reconstruction.\nTo present proof-of-concept results of a novel technology in the pediatric population.\nThe NIVA prototype was placed on each subject's wrist, and venous waveforms were collected intraoperatively. Estimated blood loss and fluid/blood product administration were recorded in real time. Venous waveforms were analyzed into a NIVA value and then correlated, along with mean arterial pressure (MAP), to volume changes. Concordance was quantified to determine if the direction of change in volume was similar to the direction of change in MAP or change in NIVA.\nOf 18 patients enrolled, 14 had usable venous waveforms, and there was a significant correlation between change in NIVA value and change in volume. Change in MAP did not correlate with change in volume. The concordance between change in MAP and change in volume was less than the concordance between change in NIVA and change in volume.\nNIVA values correlate more closely to intravascular volume changes in pediatric craniofacial patients than MAP. This initial study suggests that NIVA is a potential safe, reliable, non-invasive quantitative method of measuring intravascular volume changes for children undergoing surgery.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-07-09", "authors": ["Jenna HSobey", "Srijaya KReddy", "Kyle MHocking", "Monica EPolcz", "Christy MGuth", "CameronSchlegel", "JonWhitfield", "Susan SEagle", "Colleen MBrophy", "Bret DAlvis"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0235933\n10.1136/adc.77.6.516\n10.1007/s00134-005-2569-5\n10.1056/NEJMoa010307\n10.1542/peds.112.4.793\n10.1213/01.ane.0000268712.00756.dd\n10.1093/bja/aer090\n10.1093/bja/aes467\n10.1007/s00246-010-9776-8\n10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.01905.x\n10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70114-2\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000615\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2019.09.009\n10.1016/j.jclinane.2019.109664\n10.1111/j.1365-2044.2011.06715.x\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182a9557e\n10.1007/s00134-008-1021-z\n10.1007/s001340000795\n10.1097/00003246-200006000-00061\n10.1007/s10877-006-9051-y\n10.1111/pan.13232\n10.1007/s00431-002-1025-6"}

{"title": "Bioinspired Multiresonant Acoustic Devices Based on Electrospun Piezoelectric Polymeric Nanofibers.", "abstract": "Cochlear hair cells are critical for the conversion of acoustic into electrical signals and their dysfunction is a primary cause of acquired hearing impairments, which worsen with aging. Piezoelectric materials can reproduce the acoustic-electrical transduction properties of the cochlea and represent promising candidates for future cochlear prostheses. The majority of piezoelectric hearing devices so far developed are based on thin films, which have not managed to simultaneously provide the desired flexibility, high sensitivity, wide frequency selectivity, and biocompatibility. To overcome these issues, we hypothesized that fibrous membranes made up of polymeric piezoelectric biocompatible nanofibers could be employed to mimic the function of the basilar membrane, by selectively vibrating in response to different frequencies of sound and transmitting the resulting electrical impulses to the vestibulocochlear nerve. In this study, poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) piezoelectric nanofiber-based acoustic circular sensors were designed and fabricated using the electrospinning technique. The performance of the sensors was investigated with particular focus on the identification of the resonance frequencies and acoustic-electrical conversion in fibrous membrane with different size and fiber orientation. The voltage output (1-17 mV) varied in the range of low resonance frequency (100-400 Hz) depending on the diameter of the macroscale sensors and alignment of the fibers. The devices developed can be regarded as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the possibility of using piezoelectric fibers to convert acoustic waves into electrical signals, through possible synergistic effects of piezoelectricity and triboelectricity.

This paper proposes a hybrid system in the form of a vise with built-in strain gauges and in-house-developed piezoelectric sensors for simultaneous measurement of clamping and cutting forces. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors are fabricated and embedded in a layered jaw to measure the dynamic forces of the machine tool. A cross-shaped groove within the jaw is designed to embed strain gauges, which predominantly measure the static clamping forces.

A damage indicator has been defined that exploits the real and imaginary parts of the admittance for the detection of pin failure in the rudder stock.

{"title": "Visible or Near-Infrared Light Self-Powered Photodetectors Based on Transparent Ferroelectric Ceramics.", "abstract": "Transparent ferroelectrics, with promising prospects in transparent optoelectronic devices, have unique advantages in self-powered photodetection. The self-powered photodetectors based on the photovoltaic effect have quicker responses and higher stability compared with those based on the pyroelectric effect. However, the ferroelectric ceramics previously applied are always opaque and have no infrared light-stimulated photovoltaic effect. Thus, it would be very meaningful to design photodetectors based on infrared light-stimulated photovoltaic effect and/or transparent ferroelectric ceramics. In this work, highly optical transparent pristine lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) and band gap-engineered Ni-doped PLZT ceramics with excellent piezoelectric/ferroelectric properties were prepared by hot-pressing sintering. Stable and excellent photovoltaic performance was obtained for pristine PLZT and band gap-engineered PLZT. The value of short-circuit current density is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than those in PLZT reported in previous works. The transparent PLZT and Ni-doped PLZT ferroelectric ceramics are applied as self-powered photodetectors for the first time for 405 nm and near-infrared light, respectively. The devices based on PLZT under 405 nm light exhibit high detectivity (7.15 \u00d7 10", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-07-08", "authors": ["GengHuangfu", "HongyuanXiao", "LinGuan", "HaoyinZhong", "ChengHu", "ZhiwenShi", "YipingGuo"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c09991"}

In this study, a piezoelectric zinc oxide nanogenerator scaffold is manufactured by 3D injectable multilayer biofabrication. The piezoelectric polymeric scaffold displays desirable mechanical and physical characteristics, such as aligned porosity, high elasticity, scaffold stiffness, surface energy, and excellent shear behavior. In addition, its biocompatibility supplies Schwann cells with an adhesive, proliferative, and angiogenic interface, as is reflected by higher expression of functional proteins including nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In vivo mechanical stimuli by treadmill practice contribute to the comprehensive reparative therapy. The piezoelectric conduit accelerates nerve conducting velocity, promotes axonal remyelination, and restores motor function by recovering endplate muscles. Moreover, the piezoelectric nanogenerator scaffold creates biomimetic electrically conductive microenvironment without causing noticeable toxicity to functioning organs and improves peripheral nerve restoration by the multifunctional characteristics.

However, a wideband and active differentiator in the THz frequency band is yet to be demonstrated. Here, we propose a simple method to differentiate a THz pulse by inducing tiny phase changes on the THz beam path using a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer array.

{"title": "Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging in Turbid Liquids: A Promising Tool in Nanomedicine.", "abstract": "Tracking of biological and physiological processes on the nanoscale is a central part of the growing field of nanomedicine. Although atomic force microscopy (AFM) is one of the most appropriate techniques in this area, investigations in non-transparent fluids such as human blood are not possible with conventional AFMs due to limitations caused by the optical readout. Here, we show a promising approach based on self-sensing cantilevers (SSC) as a replacement for optical readout in biological AFM imaging. Piezo-resistors, in the form of a Wheatstone bridge, are embedded into the cantilever, whereas two of them are placed at the bending edge. This enables the deflection of the cantilever to be precisely recorded by measuring the changes in resistance. Furthermore, the conventional acoustic or magnetic vibration excitation in intermittent contact mode can be replaced by a thermal excitation using a heating loop. We show further developments of existing approaches enabling stable measurements in turbid liquids. Different readout and excitation methods are compared under various environmental conditions, ranging from dry state to human blood. To demonstrate the applicability of our laser-free bio-AFM for nanomedical research, we have selected the hemostatic process of blood coagulation as well as ultra-flat red blood cells in different turbid fluids. Furthermore, the effects on noise and scanning speed of different media are compared.

In the last years, the possibility to simultaneously photo-degrade water dissolved pollutants by means of ZnO nanostructures and to use their piezoelectric features to enhance the photo-degradation process has been investigated. In the present contribution, an easy and low-cost wet approach to synthetize hexagonal elongated ZnO microstructures in the wurtzite phase was developed. ZnO performances as photo-catalysts, under UV-light irradiation, were confirmed on water dissolved methylene blue dye. Piezoelectric responses of the synthetized ZnO microstructures were evaluated, as well, by depositing them into films onto flexible substrates, and a home-made layout was developed, in order to stimulate the ZnO microstructures deposited on solid supports by means of mechanical stress and UV photons, simultaneously. A relevant increment of the photo-degradation efficiency was observed when the piezopotential was applied, proposing the present approach as a completely eco-friendly tool, able to use renewable energy sources to degrade water solved pollutants.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-08", "authors": ["RosannaPagano", "ChiaraIngrosso", "GabrieleGiancane", "LudovicoValli", "SimonaBettini"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13132938\n10.1016/j.joule.2018.03.011\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.01.031\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/10/105002\n10.3390/s151128889\n10.1063/1.4978936\n10.1126/sciadv.1501478\n10.1016/j.mser.2009.02.001\n10.1016/0021-9290(75)90076-7\n10.1021/acsami.7b04927\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.008\n10.1021/nl061802g\n10.3406/bulmi.1880.1564\n10.1021/acsami.9b04101\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.05.003\n10.1038/nnano.2010.46\n10.1017/S0022215117000767\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.078\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114388\n10.3390/nano10010123\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111879\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.063\n10.1016/j.eml.2016.05.015\n10.1002/adma.201504299\n10.1002/adma.201200105\n10.1142/S1088424609001467\n10.1021/nl802367t\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06013\n10.1002/chem.201902886\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b09594\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.02.029\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.116\n10.1007/s40820-019-0241-9\n10.1038/nmat1014\n10.1002/asia.201501325\n10.1155/2011/269692\n10.1007/s13204-017-0553-3\n10.1039/C7RA03277C\n10.1021/jp046267s\n10.1021/jp0528919\n10.1023/A:1014008909633\n10.1016/S0927-7757(03)00383-2\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.04.134\n10.1016/j.apt.2011.05.011\n10.1021/la804009g\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-4079(1998)33:6<937::AID-CRAT937>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.3390/cryst9080395\n10.1063/1.3530631\n10.1134/S1063783412100332\n10.1063/1.4861874\n10.5185/amlett.2012.1302\n10.1021/jp910263n\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.066\n10.1063/1.4954696\n10.1038/s41598-019-57044-z\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.067\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.151840\n10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118024"}

By delivering UV light to trigger polymerization via a micrometer-size fiber core, structures of similar size can be made without resorting to any microfabrication technology, such as laser photolithography. The tool is operated using visible light energy supplied through the fibers, with no force transmission.

Here, the two generators are systematically compared based on their energy harvesting capabilities below 4\u00a0Hz. Unlike PGs, the TENG demonstrates higher power performance and is almost independent of the operating frequency, making it highly efficient for multi-frequency operation.

{"title": "Probing protein-induced membrane fouling with in-situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares.", "abstract": "Proteins are one of the major contributors to membrane fouling. The interaction between proteins and the polymer membrane at the molecular level is essential for the alleviation/prevention of membrane fouling, but remains unclear. In this work, time-dependent in-situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is applied to investigate the interaction process between two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, and the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares is integrated with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to resolve the membrane-induced conformational changes of proteins. The multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares analysis reveals a two-step process in the protein-membrane interaction and provides the kinetics of the conformational transition, which aids the segmentation of the spectral dataset. By applying two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis to different groups of the time-dependent spectra, the sequential order of the secondary structural changes of proteins is determined. The proteins initially undergo unfolding transition to a more open, less structured state, which appears to be triggered by the hydrophobic membrane surface. Afterwards, the proteins become aggregated with the high anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet content, aggravating the membrane fouling. The conformational transition process of proteins was also confirmed by the atomic force microscopic images and quartz crystal microbalance measurement.

First, we used a piezoelectric system validated for Mus musculus to monitor sleep in both species. We also included wild M. musculus to control for alterations generated by laboratory-reared conditions for M. musculus. Using this comparative framework, we found that A. cahirinus, lab M. musculus, and wild M. musculus were primarily nocturnal, but exhibited distinct behavioral patterns. Although the activity of A. cahirinus increased sharply at dark onset, it decreased sharply just two hours later under group and individual housing conditions. To further characterize sleep patterns and sleep-related variables, we set up EEG/EMG and video recordings and found that A. cahirinus sleep significantly more than M. musculus, exhibit nearly three times more REM, and sleep almost exclusively with their eyes open.

{"title": "Wearable piezoelectric mass sensor based on pH sensitive hydrogels for sweat pH monitoring.", "abstract": "Colorimetric and electrochemical (bio)sensors are commonly employed in wearable platforms for sweat monitoring; nevertheless, they suffer from low stability of the sensitive element. In contrast, mass-(bio)sensors are commonly used for analyte detection at laboratory level only, due to their rigidity.

The device exploits the flexibility of piezoelectric AlN membranes fabricated on a polyimide substrate combined to the sensitive properties of a pH responsive hydrogel based on PEG-DA/CEA molecules.

{"title": "Human Oral Motion-Powered Smart Dental Implant (SDI) for In Situ Ambulatory Photo-biomodulation Therapy.", "abstract": "Peri-implant disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the soft and hard tissues surrounding a dental implant. However, current preventative methods are insufficient due to the limited bioactivity on the dental implant and poor patient compliance. Recently, photo-biomodulation (PBM) therapy that can recover and regenerate peri-implant soft tissue has attracted considerable attention in dentistry. In this paper, a seamless human oral motion-powered dental implant system (called Smart Dental Implant or SDI) is presented as an ambulatory PBM therapy modality. SDI allows the in situ light delivery, which is enabled by the energy harvesting from dynamic human oral motions (chewing and brushing) via an engineered piezoelectric dental crown, an associated circuit, and micro light emitting diodes (LEDs). The SDI also offers adequate mechanical strength as the clinical standards. Using primary human gingival keratinocytes (HGKs) as a model host organism and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a model inflammatory stimulus, effective SDI-mediated PBM therapy is demonstrated. A new class of dental implants could be an ambulatory PBM therapy platform for the prevention of peri-implant disease without patient dependency, warranting long-lasting dental implants.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2020-07-03", "authors": ["MoonchulPark", "SayemulIslam", "Hye-EunKim", "JonathanKorostoff", "Markus BBlatz", "GeelsuHwang", "AlbertKim"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202000658"}

{"title": "A Preliminary Prototype High-Speed Feedback Control of an Artificial Cochlear Sensory Epithelium Mimicking Function of Outer Hair Cells.", "abstract": "A novel feedback control technique for the local oscillation amplitude in an artificial cochlear sensory epithelium that mimics the functions of the outer hair cells in the cochlea is successfully developed and can be implemented with a control time on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. The prototype artificial cochlear sensory epithelium was improved from that developed in our previous study to enable the instantaneous determination of the local resonance position based on the electrical output from a bimorph piezoelectric membrane. The device contains local patterned electrodes deposited with micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology that is used to detect the electrical output and oscillate the device by applying local electrical stimuli. The main feature of the present feedback control system is the principle that the resonance position is recognized by simultaneously measuring the local electrical outputs of all of the electrodes and comparing their magnitudes, which drastically reduces the feedback control time. In this way, it takes 0.8 s to control the local oscillation of the device, representing the speed of control with the order of one hundred times relative to that in the previous study using the mechanical automatic stage to scan the oscillation amplitude at each electrode. Furthermore, the intrinsic difficulties in the experiment such as the electrical measurement against the electromagnetic noise, adhesion of materials, and fatigue failure mechanism of the oscillation system are also shown and discussed in detail based on the many scientific aspects.

In this paper, a symmetrical ring-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester (SR-PEH) is designed to provide energy for the sensor to detect the ambient temperature. The finite element method is used by utilizing software COMSOL 5.4, and the electromechanical coupling model of the piezoelectric cantilever is established. The output performance equations are proposed; the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) integration process of the SR-PEH, circuit, and sensor is stated; and the changing trend of the output power density is explained from an energy perspective. In the logarithmic coordinate system, the results indicate that the output voltage and output power are approximately linear with the temperature when the resistance is constant. In addition, the growth rate of the output voltage and output power decreases with an increase of resistance under the condition of constant temperature. In addition, with an increase of temperature, the growth rate of the output power is faster than that of the output voltage. Furthermore, resistance has a more dramatic effect on the output voltage, whereas temperature has a more significant effect on the output power. More importantly, the comparison with the conventional cantilever-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester (CC-PEH) shows that the SR-PEH can improve the output performance and broaden the frequency band.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-07-03", "authors": ["NannanZhou", "RongqiLi", "HongruiAo", "ChuanbingZhang", "HongyuanJiang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11070640\n10.1016/j.compag.2019.105169\n10.1002/stc.2525\n10.1016/j.measurement.2020.107853\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.117287\n10.3390/mi10090618\n10.1016/j.optlastec.2020.106293\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.059\n10.3390/en12214051\n10.3390/nano8060367\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.116261\n10.1016/j.mssp.2020.105014\n10.3390/s20082397\n10.1007/s40996-018-0188-y\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.116604\n10.1080/15376494.2018.1472341\n10.1007/s00542-016-2940-1\n10.1016/j.mne.2020.100050\n10.1177/1045389X19828820\n10.3390/ma13102330\n10.3390/mi10100639\n10.3390/mi11020143\n10.1016/j.carbon.2020.04.007\n10.1007/s00542-018-3845-y\n10.1177/1099636217726330\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2019.103439\n10.1007/s00542-019-04495-z\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227409\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228132"}

{"title": "Motion Detection Using Tactile Sensors Based on Pressure-Sensitive Transistor Arrays.", "abstract": "In recent years, to develop more spontaneous and instant interfaces between a system and users, technology has evolved toward designing efficient and simple gesture recognition (GR) techniques. As a tool for acquiring human motion, a tactile sensor system, which converts the human touch signal into a single datum and executes a command by translating a bundle of data into a text language or triggering a preset sequence as a haptic motion, has been developed. The tactile sensor aims to collect comprehensive data on various motions, from the touch of a fingertip to large body movements. The sensor devices have different characteristics that are important for target applications. Furthermore, devices can be fabricated using various principles, and include piezoelectric, capacitive, piezoresistive, and field-effect transistor types, depending on the parameters to be achieved. Here, we introduce tactile sensors consisting of field-effect transistors (FETs). GR requires a process involving the acquisition of a large amount of data in an array rather than a single sensor, suggesting the importance of fabricating a tactile sensor as an array. In this case, an FET-type pressure sensor can exploit the advantages of active-matrix sensor arrays that allow high-array uniformity, high spatial contrast, and facile integration with electrical circuitry. We envision that tactile sensors based on FETs will be beneficial for GR as well as future applications, and these sensors will provide substantial opportunities for next-generation motion sensing systems.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-07-02", "authors": ["JiukJang", "Yoon SunJun", "HunkyuSeo", "MoohyunKim", "Jang-UngPark"], "doi": "10.3390/s20133624\n10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2768405\n10.3390/polym9080303\n10.3390/s19204353\n10.1038/ncomms7080\n10.1002/advs.201500169\n10.1017/atsip.2013.9\n10.1126/science.aao0098\n10.1021/nn506832w\n10.1021/acsnano.6b04201\n10.1002/adfm.201402987\n10.1002/adma.201400633\n10.1002/admt.201900082\n10.1126/sciadv.aaw2844\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00150\n10.1039/C6NR09610G\n10.1002/adma.201700538\n10.1039/C6NR02041K\n10.1038/am.2016.113\n10.1186/s11671-015-0748-z\n10.1002/adma.201804690\n10.1038/am.2017.172\n10.1038/ncomms6747\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02978\n10.1002/adma.201100906\n10.1021/nl061802g\n10.3390/s18113614\n10.3390/s140202225\n10.3390/s17112451\n10.1002/adma.201304742\n10.3390/s140305296\n10.1039/C4MH00147H\n10.1002/aisy.201900090\n10.1002/admi.201801061\n10.3390/s17112582\n10.1002/adma.201303041\n10.1126/sciadv.1500661\n10.1021/nl052171d\n10.1038/ncomms4132\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1021/nl802367t\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1002/adma.201504299\n10.1126/sciadv.1700015\n10.1021/nn403838y\n10.1002/adma.201200523\n10.1002/adma.201470177\n10.1016/j.procir.2013.01.013\n10.3390/s17112653\n10.1002/adma.201500009\n10.3390/s18072395\n10.1039/c3nr05496a\n10.1038/nmat2834\n10.3390/s18092781\n10.3390/s20092459\n10.3390/s20020371\n10.1002/adma.201400918\n10.1002/adma.201302869\n10.1002/adfm.201301845\n10.1073/pnas.0401918101\n10.1038/nature12314\n10.1038/nmat3711\n10.1016/j.nantod.2010.10.008\n10.1126/science.1234855\n10.1038/ncomms14950\n10.1021/nn500441k\n10.1002/adma.201505124\n10.1002/adfm.201505070\n10.1039/C6TC03329F\n10.1038/nnano.2011.184\n10.1002/adfm.201802989\n10.1002/adma.201503407\n10.1038/nature13792\n10.1126/science.aaw2781\n10.1002/adfm.201902720\n10.1002/adma.201405826\n10.1038/ncomms5496\n10.1002/aelm.201600548\n10.1038/nmat2835\n10.1002/adma.201404850\n10.1063/1.3191677\n10.1126/science.1179963\n10.1063/1.2335838\n10.1021/acsnano.5b07121\n10.1016/j.mser.2017.02.001\n10.1021/acsnano.7b01374\n10.1021/acsnano.6b05507\n10.1002/adma.201104365\n10.1002/adma.201606346\n10.1021/acsnano.7b08447\n10.1038/ncomms2832\n10.1021/acsami.6b05177\n10.1021/acsami.6b04225\n10.1038/ncomms7269\n10.1002/adma.201305064\n10.1073/pnas.0502392102\n10.1038/s41467-017-02685-9\n10.1109/JMEMS.2007.896716\n10.1002/admt.201800284\n10.1021/nn505953t\n10.1126/science.1206157\n10.1126/scirobotics.aar7650\n10.1002/anie.201800907\n10.1126/scirobotics.aah3690\n10.1126/scirobotics.aav1488\n10.1038/s41928-018-0024-1\n10.1002/admt.201900928\n10.1021/acsnano.9b06576\n10.1021/acsnano.0c00363\n10.1002/adma.201302240\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.03.009\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2014.12.007\n10.1002/adma.201803309\n10.1021/acsami.7b15386\n10.1021/acsnano.8b07995\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.024\n10.1126/scirobotics.aau6914\n10.1002/adfm.201801858\n10.1038/s41586-019-1234-z\n10.1109/TOH.2016.2521378\n10.1109/TIM.2016.2514779\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2432127\n10.1109/LRA.2017.2720853\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.05.047\n10.1007/s12274-019-2595-1\n10.1126/science.1129110\n10.1002/advs.201802351\n10.1002/adfm.201904532\n10.1364/OME.9.003878\n10.1002/adfm.201705480\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.917481\n10.1002/adfm.201400379\n10.1038/ncomms14997\n10.1126/sciadv.aap9841"}

{"title": "Ultrasound Measurement of Skeletal Muscle Contractile Parameters Using Flexible and Wearable Single-Element Ultrasonic Sensor.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is considered as a near-constant volume system, and the contractions of the muscle are related to the changes in tissue thickness. Assessment of the skeletal muscle contractile parameters such as maximum contraction thickness ( T h ), contraction time ( T c ), contraction velocity ( V c ), sustain time ( T s ), and half-relaxation ( T r ) provides valuable information for various medical applications. This paper presents a single-element wearable ultrasonic sensor (WUS) and a method to measure the skeletal muscle contractile parameters in A-mode ultrasonic data acquisition. The developed WUS was made of double-layer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric polymer films with a simple and low-cost fabrication process. A flexible, lightweight, thin, and small size WUS would provide a secure attachment to the skin surface without affecting the muscle contraction dynamics of interest. The developed WUS was employed to monitor the contractions of gastrocnemius (GC) muscle of a human subject. The GC muscle contractions were evoked by the electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) at varying EMS frequencies from 2 Hz up to 30 Hz. The tissue thickness changes due to the muscle contractions were measured by utilizing a time-of-flight method in the ultrasonic through-transmission mode. The developed WUS demonstrated the capability to monitor the tissue thickness changes during the unfused and fused tetanic contractions. The tetanic progression level was quantitatively assessed using the parameter of the fusion index (FI) obtained.

Samples with a composition of 95 wt.% Mg+5 wt.% PVDF (called 95Mg + 5PVDF) were made via milling in hydrogen atmosphere in a planetary ball mill (reactive planetary ball milling). The hydrogen release reaction of magnesium hydride formed in the as-prepared 95Mg+5PVDF during reactive planetary ball milling started at 681 K. In the third cycle (CN = 3), the amount of hydrogen absorbed for 60 min, A (60 min), was 3.44 wt.% hydrogen at 573 K in 12 bar hydrogen. The PVDF is believed to have melted during reactive planetary ball milling, and the sliding or lubrication between Mg particles and hardened steel balls was avoided, leading to a good contact between them and a highly effective milling. The milling in hydrogen atmosphere in a planetary ball mill of Mg with PVDF is believed to have generated defects and cracks. The Mg\u2082C\u2083 produced from PVDF during hydrogen uptake-release cycling is believed to have been spread among particles and to have kept particles from coalescing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use a polymer PVDF as an additive material for the amelioration of hydrogen uptake and release features of Mg.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2020-07-02", "authors": ["Young JunKwak", "Myoung YoupSong"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2020.18839"}

Tau protein detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is significantly correlated with AD and is well recognized as a hallmark of the disease. Served for detection of analytes of interest, biosensor device comprises a physical transducer and a keen biological recognition component. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations may be performed through analyzation of the data, which is gathered by measurable signals converted from biological reaction. Antibodies, receptors, microorganisms, nucleic acids, enzymes, cells and tissues, as well as some biomimetic structures, normally constitute the biosensor biological recognition part. Production of nanobiosensor, which was made possible through several accomplishments in nano- and fabrication technology, opens up new biotechnological horizons in diagnosis of multiple diseases.

Apart from their roles as components of the human body, inorganic materials have unique properties, such as magnetic, antibacterial, and piezoelectric, so that INPs have been widely used as either carriers or inducers. However, most of the bio-applicable INPs, especially those consisting of metal, can cause cytotoxicity.

The experiments featured in situ X-ray tomography and diffraction measurements of contact fabric, particle kinematics, average per-particle stress tensors, and interparticle forces. The experimentally measured packing configuration and inferred interparticle forces at different sample stresses were used to construct spring networks characterized by Hessian and damping matrices. The ultrasound responses of these network were simulated to investigate the origins of wave velocity, acoustic paths, dispersion, and attenuation. Results revealed that both packing structure and interparticle force heterogeneity played an important role in controlling wave velocity and dispersion, while packing structure alone quantitatively explained most of the observed wave attenuation.

To suppress this interference, lightweight materials that are non-corrosive in nature and easy to fabricate, design, integrate and process are in great demand. In the present study, we have grown copper sulphide 'flowers' on graphene oxide by a facile one pot hydrothermal technique. The growth time of the \"flower-like\" structure was optimised based on structural (XRD) and morphological analysis (SEM). Then, the as-prepared structures were dispersed in a PVDF matrix using melt blending.

The need to mitigate measurement artifacts and enhance sensitivity, however, requires narrowly-defined and strict sample preparation protocols. This limits reliable and facile characterization; for example, when using common substrates such as Silicon or glass. Here, we demonstrate a closed-loop (CL) piezo controller design for responsivity-corrected AFM-IR imaging. Instead of the usual mode of recording cantilever deflection driven by sample expansion, the principle of our approach is to maintain a zero amplitude harmonic cantilever deflection by CL control of a subsample piezo. We show that the piezo voltage used to maintain a null deflection provides a reliable measure of the local IR absorption with significantly reduced noise. A complete analytical description of the CL operation and characterization of the controller for achieving robust performance are presented.

In the present study, two piezoelectric print heads of different designs (Spectra SE-128 AA and Konica Minolta KM512SHX) were systematically compared with the objective of deepening the process understanding and identifying the key factors on the resulted quantities. As substrates, oral thin films made from 15% (w/w) hypromellose (HPMC) casting solution were used.

A well-known cross-correlation method of magnetic signatures is not appropriate for calculating the vehicle speed of long vehicles owing to limited resources and a long calculation time. Therefore, the adaptive signature cropping algorithm was developed and used with a difference quotient of a magnetic signature.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Solutions: A Review.", "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to review current methods of energy harvesting, while focusing on piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy harvesting technique is based on the materials' property of generating an electric field when a mechanical force is applied. This phenomenon is known as the direct piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric transducers can be of different shapes and materials, making them suitable for a multitude of applications. To optimize the use of piezoelectric devices in applications, a model is needed to observe the behavior in the time and frequency domain. In addition to different aspects of piezoelectric modeling, this paper also presents several circuits used to maximize the energy harvested.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-06-25", "authors": ["CorinaCovaci", "AurelGontean"], "doi": "10.3390/s20123512\n10.1177/0021998318788604\n10.3390/s20092495\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab3605\n10.3390/s18124277\n10.1002/mawe.201900002\n10.1109/SURV.2011.060710.00094\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.010\n10.1109/icaccs.2019.8728367\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111973\n10.3390/s140304755\n10.1109/JMEMS.2004.830151\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106277\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.075\n10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00248-7\n10.1177/1045389X19828512\n10.1007/s40684-019-00144-y\n10.1007/978-1-4615-0485-6\n10.5772/51360\n10.1088/1742-6596/660/1/012118\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.01.004\n10.1007/s00542-013-1938-1\n10.1007/s00542-006-0152-9\n10.1021/nn507455f\n10.1039/C5CS00812C\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.073\n10.1063/1.4932947\n10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.035\n10.1109/nano.2017.8117409\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.10.003\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.022\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.093\n10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.053\n10.1515/cdbme-2017-0067\n10.1007/978-3-319-19851-4_2\n10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012044\n10.1002/aenm.201601255\n10.1021/acsnano.7b07534\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.011\n10.1002/adfm.201501331\n10.3390/s150305020\n10.22055/JACM.2018.25097.1228\n10.1051/jphystap:0188100100038100\n10.1063/1.3167773\n10.2514/2.1561\n10.1109/icmech.2019.8722871\n10.1080/00150193.2010.505852\n10.1109/TCSI.2016.2608999\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab37be\n10.1063/1.4962979\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.12.025\n10.24200/sci.2020.54665.3856\n10.1147/sj.353.0618\n10.1117/12.606009\n10.1109/TPEL.2002.802194\n10.1177/1045389X09357971\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1428041\n10.1515/ehs-2016-0028\n10.1002/mame.201800463\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1109/40.928763\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.12.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1166/jnn.2019.16180\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055019\n10.1126/science.1124005\n10.1088/1361-6528/aaa6bd\n10.1016/j.sbsr.2016.05.008\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.11.040\n10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.085\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1969\n10.1016/S1002-0071(12)60050-1\n10.1557/adv.2017.305\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.184\n10.1007/s10854-018-8993-4\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.047\n10.1117/12.715773\n10.1088/1757-899X/210/1/012078\n10.1002/pen.24088\n10.1179/1743284714Y.0000000605\n10.1063/1.3525045\n10.1007/s10832-005-0897-z\n10.1063/1.3040011\n10.1063/1.4737170\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/4/043001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.09.015\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025005\n10.1177/1045389X16629568\n10.1063/1.4900845\n10.1117/12.484247\n10.1177/0361198119830308\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.11.013\n10.1049/cp.2016.1269\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2808239\n10.3390/s150922914\n10.1021/nl061802g\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.238\n10.1111/jace.16409\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1734\n10.1002/adfm.201706895\n10.1021/acsaem.9b01000\n10.1007/978-3-319-06617-2_1\n10.1177/1045389X05054042\n10.1115/1.2801282\n10.1109/37.588158\n10.1109/icmech.2015.7083990\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111317\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.05.015\n10.1155/2014/930503\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.016\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.08.017\n10.1016/j.cpc.2010.12.039\n10.3390/s20092519\n10.3390/en12183516\n10.1115/1.4034775\n10.1063/1.3644130\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/030\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065021\n10.1088/0957-0233/21/2/022001\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/7/075013\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.03.023\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/01/015035\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.11.021\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.018\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.03.008\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/12/125020\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.11.034\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/102001\n10.1109/TMAG.2013.2284253\n10.1115/1.4000809\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/12/125009\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.06.046\n10.1063/1.4982967\n10.1007/s11012-018-0900-9\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.073\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/3/035005\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/11/115021\n10.1016/j.enconman.2015.09.065\n10.1117/12.2084427\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad2c8\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094008\n10.3390/s19224922\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/001\n10.1109/TPEL.2003.809379\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/031\n10.1177/1045389X08098194\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035030\n10.1177/1045389X05056859\n10.1017/S095679251800058X\n10.3390/s16071045"}

{"title": "Measurement of Shear Strain Field in a Soft Material Using a Sensor System Consisting of Distributed Piezoelectric Polymer Film.", "abstract": "Measurement of the internal stress and strain distributions within soft materials is necessary in the field of skin contact safety. However, conventional interactive force sensors cannot efficiently obtain or estimate these distributions. Herein, a shear strain sensor system consisting of distributed built-in piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer films was developed to measure the internal shear strain field of a soft material. A shear strain sensing model was mathematically established, based on the piezoelectricity and mechanical behavior of a bending cantilever beam, to explain the sensing principle. An experiment in three-dimensional measurement of the shear strain distribution within an artificial skin was designed and conducted to assess the sensitivity of the sensing model. This sensor system could visualize the shear strain field and was sensitive to different contact conditions.

{"title": "Technique and Circuit for Contactless Readout of Piezoelectric MEMS Resonator Sensors.", "abstract": "A technique and electronic circuit for contactless electromagnetic interrogation of piezoelectric micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) resonator sensors are proposed. The adopted resonator is an aluminum-nitride (AlN) thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon (TPoS) disk vibrating in radial contour mode at about 6.3 MHz. The MEMS resonator is operated in one-port configuration and it is connected to a spiral coil, forming the sensor unit. A proximate electronic interrogation unit is electromagnetically coupled through a readout coil to the sensor unit. The proposed technique exploits interleaved excitation and detection phases of the MEMS resonator. A tailored electronic circuit manages the periodic switching between the excitation phase, where it generates the excitation signal driving the readout coil, and the detection phase, where it senses the transient decaying response of the resonator by measuring through a high-impedance amplifier the voltage induced back across the readout coil. This approach advantageously ensures that the readout frequency of the MEMS resonator is first order independent of the interrogation distance between the readout and sensor coils. The reported experimental results show successful contactless readout of the MEMS resonator independently from the interrogation distance over a range of 12 mm, and the application as a resonant sensor for ambient temperature and as a resonant acoustic-load sensor to detect and track the deposition and evaporation processes of water microdroplets on the MEMS resonator surface.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-06-25", "authors": ["MarcoBa\u00f9", "MarcoFerrari", "HabibaBegum", "AbidAli", "Joshua E-YLee", "VittorioFerrari"], "doi": "10.3390/s20123483\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/1/013001\n10.1109/IEDM.2002.1175981\n10.1038/micronano.2015.5\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab1b04\n10.1109/58.827416\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0167x\n10.1016/j.mee.2014.08.015\n10.3390/mi7090160\n10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597731\n10.1109/ULTSYM.2005.1602897\n10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.182\n10.1088/1757-899X/149/1/012190\n10.1023/B:JECR.0000033998.72845.51\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.886012\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.04.029\n10.3390/mi9090449\n10.3390/s17061264\n10.1109/TIM.2011.2122110\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2602298\n10.1016/j.aeue.2018.05.019\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.02.019\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2872923\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2039697\n10.1007/978-3-030-37558-4_41\n10.1039/C4AN01389A\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.252\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.12.001\n10.1063/1.2960571\n10.1088/0957-0233/20/12/124005\n10.1109/TIM.2006.873792\n10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398403"}

Due to noncentral symmetry, the two monolayers exhibit vertical piezoelectricity with large piezoelectric coefficients d31 (1.745 and 1.716 pm V-1 for CrBSe and CrTeI, respectively), which are larger than those of most materials in existence. Both systems are also ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors, with Curie temperature (TC) higher than 550 K and large in-plane magnetic anisotropy energy. Superexchange interactions are responsible for high-temperature FM order. A semiconductor to half metal transition can be regulated by carrier doping, which can be carried out by gate voltages. Doped systems still retain the same FM order as pristine ones; in particular, hole doping enhances exchange coupling, thereby increasing TC.

Using a custom-designed langatate crystal microbalance following the principle for piezoelectric microbalances, but under harsher conditions, allowed us to present adsorption equilibrium measurements on a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) surface-mounted metal-organic framework (SURMOF) thin film at temperatures between 35 and 100 \u00b0C and at a pressure range up to 10 bars. The layer-by-layer liquid-phase epitaxy approach was used to deposit ZIF-8 SURMOF thin films on langatate crystals.

When a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) is embedded in asphalt pavements or concrete pavements, it is subjected to traffic loads and generates electricity.

In this paper, a numerical study on the influence of embedding depth of the PEH and the horizontal distance between a tire load and the PEH on piezoelectric power generation is presented. The result shows that the relative position between the PEH and the load influences the voltage magnitude, and different modes of stress state change voltage polarity. Two mathematic correlations between the embedding depth, the horizontal distance, and the generated voltage were fitted based on the computational results.

The effectiveness of the approach is assessed in comparison to the surface-mounted layer. The proposed manufacturing alleviates difficulties associated with trimming edges of composites when embedding wires. The Electro-Mechanical Impedance technique is used to access the integrity of the piezoelectric sensors bonding process. Comparisons of ultrasonic guided waves are made between embedded and surface-mounted diagnostic layers and their penetration through and across the thickness of the composites. Temperature influences with the range from -40 \u00b0C up to 80 \u00b0C on embedded and surface-mounted guided waves are investigated. An investigation is carried out into the relationship between amplitude and time-of-flight with temperature at different excitation frequencies.

{"title": "Development of Hydrophilic PVDF Membrane Using Vapour Induced Phase Separation Method for Produced Water Treatment.", "abstract": "During the production of oil and gas, a large amount of oily wastewater is generated, which would pollute the environment if discharged without proper treatment. As one of the most promising treatment options, membrane material used for oily wastewater treatment should possess desirable properties of high hydraulic performance combined with high membrane fouling resistance. This project employs the vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) technique to develop a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an additive for produced water treatment. Results show that thanks to its slow nonsolvent intake, the VIPS method hinders additive leaching during the cast film immersion. The results also reveal that the exposure of the film to the open air before immersion greatly influences the structure of the developed membranes. By extending the exposure time from 0 to 30 min, the membrane morphology change from typical asymmetric with large macrovoids to the macrovoid-free porous symmetric membrane with a granular structure, which corresponds to 35% increment of steady-state permeability to 189 L\u00b7m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-06-21", "authors": ["Normi IzatiMat Nawi", "Ho MinChean", "NorazanitaShamsuddin", "Muhammad RoilBilad", "ThanitpornNarkkun", "KajornsakFaungnawakij", "Asim LaeeqKhan"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10060121\n10.1016/j.desal.2008.06.035\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2016.10.011\n10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00699.x\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.09.004\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.04.069\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)80020-4\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117601\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2016.01.031\n10.1016/S0376-7388(97)00224-X\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.05.046\n10.3390/polym11071160\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.11.019\n10.1016/j.memsci.2004.06.011\n10.1007/s10853-016-9744-7\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2020.109708\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.12.045\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.01.030\n10.1002/ceat.201800304\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.108\n10.1016/j.rser.2019.109666\n10.1016/j.desal.2015.08.015\n10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101264\n10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.062\n10.1016/0376-7388(96)00088-9\n10.1016/0376-7388(92)80134-6\n10.1016/0376-7388(92)80135-7\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.07.041\n10.3390/membranes8030071\n10.1080/00222346808212454\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.068\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.064\n10.1006/jcis.1993.1372\n10.1002/app.27626\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.10.044\n10.1021/ie101928r\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.06.001\n10.3390/polym11050865\n10.1155/2018/1525014\n10.1039/C5RA08705H\n10.1016/j.carbon.2016.10.055\n10.1039/C5RA11842E\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.01.068\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.10.027\n10.1016/0376-7388(94)00263-X\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.12.012\n10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.102\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)00560-3\n10.1002/adma.201204520\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.08.018\n10.2166/wst.2010.122\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.10.017\n10.1021/acsami.7b02382\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.03.031\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.08.019\n10.3390/polym11101687\n10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.175\n10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109359\n10.1016/j.biteb.2020.100429\n10.3390/polym12020432"}

Part II focuses on piezoelectric surgery-regulated osteoblast activity and changes occurring in the bone during the regeneration phase. The results indicate that at 30 Hz, the remineralization process starts at day 14 and continues until day 70, with osteoblast progenitor cells observed in the periodontal ligament around acellular new bone as early as day 14.

Implant systems compatible with reduced alveolar bone volume are required. To design, manufacture, and test a non-cylindrical dental implant system using piezotomes and custom-designed matching titanium mini-implants to address the needs of patients with missing teeth and narrow jawbone.\nTapered mini-implants with a rectangular cross-section (4.6 mm \u00d7\u20092.1\u2009mm) were machined with dimensions that could accommodate narrow alveolar ridges. The performance of the implants were tested in both static and fatigue cycle 30\u00b0 compression tests. Tapered, rectangular cutting tools that matched the overall trapezoidal morphology of the implant were also designed. These novel tools were engineered to be compatible with commercially available piezoelectric osteotomes. Tools were optimized using finite element analysis and were manufactured accordingly and were used by a periodontal surgery team in a pork rib bone model to monitor utility of the device and ease of use.\nThe rectangular design of the implant allows for a full occlusal load due to the larger implant flexural rigidity compared to a similar diameter mini-implant with a standard cylindrical design. During 30\u00b0 compression fatigue tests, the implant tested at 340 N did not fail after 5M cycles as shown in Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Finite element analysis allowed for functional optimization of the roughing and finishing tools. In the pork rib model, these tools successfully cut trapezoidal holes that matched the dimensions of the implant.\nThe implant system here demonstrates the feasibility of a mini-implant system that has superior flexural rigidity and potentially circumvents the need for patient bone augmentation.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental dental research", "date": "2020-06-20", "authors": ["HolgerWirz", "StefanTeufelhart", "ChristineMcBeth", "RobertGyurko", "SergeDibart", "AlexisSauer-Budge"], "doi": "10.1002/cre2.276"}

The power source technology of batteries and wireless charging for driving a light-emitting diode (LED) may cause inconveniences during treatment. In addition, the development of telemedicine and Internet medicine put forward higher demands on treatment methods, such as better patient compliance and autonomous management. Here, we show a self-powered photodynamic therapy (s-PDT) system with two different irradiation modes that can be autonomously managed by patients. The as-fabricated s-PDT system based on a twinning structured piezoelectric nanogenerator is powered by energy harvested from body motion and realizes effective tumor tissue killing and inhibition. As demonstrated at the cellular level, the s-PDT system can significantly suppress tumor cell growth with the pulsed light stimulation mode. When the miniature LED was implanted subcutaneously in mice with transplanted tumors, the s-PDT system led to significant antitumor effects by irradiation with intermittent continuous light stimulation mode for 12 days, and an 87.46% tumor inhibition rate was obtained.

{"title": "Preserving Softness and Elastic Recovery in Silicone-Based Stretchable Electrodes Using Carbon Nanotubes.", "abstract": "Soft electronics based on various rubbers have lately been needed in many advanced applications such as soft robotics, wearable electronics, and remote health monitoring. The ability of a self-sensing material to be monitored in use provides a significant advantage. However, conductive fillers usually used to increase conductivity also change mechanical properties. Most importantly, the initial sought-after properties of rubber, namely softness and long elastic deformation, are usually compromised. This work presents full mechanical and electro-mechanical characterization, together with self-sensing abilities of a vinyl methyl silicone rubber (VMQ) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite, featuring conductivity while maintaining low hardness. The research demonstrates that MWCNT/VMQ with just 4 wt.% of MWCNT are as conductive as commercial conductive VMQ based on Carbon Black, while exhibiting lower hardness and higher elastic recovery (~20% plastic deformation, similar to pure rubber). The research also demonstrates piezo-resistivity and Raman-sensitivity, allowing for self-sensing. Using morphological data, proposed mechanisms for the superior electrical and mechanical behavior, as well as the in-situ fingerprint for the composite conditions are presented. This research novelty is in the full MWCNT/VMQ mechanical and electro-mechanical characterization, thus demonstrating its ability to serve as a sensor over large local strains, multiple straining cycles, and environmental damage.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2020-06-18", "authors": ["AndreyBannych", "SariKatz", "ZahavaBarkay", "NoaLachman"], "doi": "10.3390/polym12061345\n10.1080/19475411.2015.1121632\n10.3390/c3020010\n10.1016/j.matdes.2012.09.029\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.217-219.130\n10.1021/acsami.6b13074\n10.1007/s11595-011-0316-z\n10.1016/j.carbon.2011.08.070\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.12.008\n10.1016/j.polymer.2007.06.046\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00066-6\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.07.014\n10.1016/j.polymer.2012.05.039\n10.1038/srep07232\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.030\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.10.017\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.018\n10.1002/anie.201100414\n10.1177/0731684410394008\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.10.025\n10.1016/B978-0-12-816198-2.00002-5\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.08.022\n10.1016/S0008-6223(01)00164-6\n10.1016/S0266-3538(01)00094-X\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.06.018\n10.1142/S0217979204025336\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2009.08.023\n10.1080/00222340600770335\n10.1016/S1359-835X(00)00107-X\n10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/065"}
{"title": "Analytical Modelling and Optimization of a Piezoelectric Cantilever Energy Harvester with In-Span Attachment.", "abstract": "In this paper, the location of masses and of a piezoelectric patch for energy harvesting reported onto a vibrating cantilever beam is studied and optimized. To this aim, a genetic algorithm is adapted and utilized to optimize the voltage amplitude generated by the piezoelectric patches by choosing attachment mass, attachment mass moment of inertia, attachment location, piezoelectric patch location and force location on the beam as parameters. While an analytical approach is proposed to evaluate the voltage amplitude, a multi-layer perceptron neural network is trained by the derived characteristic matrix to obtain an approximate function for natural frequencies based on the attachment parameters. The trained network is then used in the core of genetic algorithm to find the best optimization variables for any excitation frequency. Numerical simulation by COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software validates the calculated voltage by analytical approach. The optimization method successfully matches the natural frequency of the beam with the excitation frequency which therefore maximizes the output energy. On the other hand, the superiority of the optimized design over the conventional configuration in harvesting the energy at high frequency excitation is also approved.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-06-18", "authors": ["AbbasHomayouni-Amlashi", "AbdenbiMohand-Ousaid", "MickyRakotondrabe"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11060591\n10.1063/1.4896166\n10.1007/s12541-011-0151-3\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.076\n10.1177/1045389X17730926\n10.3390/app6010010\n10.3390/app5041942\n10.3390/app7121324\n10.1177/1045389X08098096\n10.1115/1.2890402\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009\n10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2111\n10.1007/s10409-016-0557-3\n10.1007/s12213-020-00129-0\n10.1109/LRA.2019.2962367\n10.1016/0045-7825(88)90086-2\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2017.08.048\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018\n10.1115/1.2981094\n10.1109/MPRV.2005.14\n10.1177/1045389X07085639\n10.1007/s10409-017-0743-y\n10.1016/j.apm.2017.04.043\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2015.03.001\n10.1016/S0020-7403(98)00103-9\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.06.080\n10.1177/1077546309106526\n10.1155/2014/485630\n10.1006/jsvi.1997.1161\n10.1016/S0020-7403(01)00072-8\n10.1016/S0020-7403(02)00182-0\n10.1109/LRA.2018.2795045\n10.1109/TIM.2019.2950760"}

{"title": "Neural Network Self-Tuning Control for a Piezoelectric Actuator.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEA) have been widely used in the ultra-precision manufacturing fields. However, the hysteresis nonlinearity between the input voltage and the output displacement, which possesses the properties of rate dependency and multivalued mapping, seriously impedes the positioning accuracy of the PEA. This paper investigates a control methodology without the hysteresis model for PEA actuated nanopositioning systems, in which the inherent drawback generated by the hysteresis nonlinearity aggregates the control accuracy of the PEA. To address this problem, a neural network self-tuning control approach is proposed to realize the high accuracy tracking with respect to the system uncertainties and hysteresis nonlinearity of the PEA. First, the PEA is described as a nonlinear equation with two variables, which are unknown.

Regarding bone-related diseases and considering the piezoelectric nature of bone, piezoelectric scaffolds electromechanically stimulated by a bioreactor, providing the stimuli to the cells, allows a biomimetic approach and thus, mimicking the required microenvironment for effective growth and differentiation of bone cells. In this work, a bioreactor has been designed and built allowing to magnetically stimulate magnetoelectric scaffolds and therefore provide mechanical and electrical stimuli to the cells through magnetomechanical or magnetoelectrical effects, depending on the piezoelectric nature of the scaffold. While mechanical bioreactors need direct application of the stimuli on the scaffolds, the herein proposed magnetic bioreactors allow for a remote stimulation without direct contact with the material. Thus, the stimuli application (23 mT at a frequency of 0.3 Hz) to cells seeded on the magnetoelectric, leads to an increase in cell viability of almost 30% with respect to cell culture under static conditions. This could be valuable to mimic what occurs in the human body and for application in immobilized patients.

However, conventional batteries only last for a few years, and additional surgeries are needed for replacement. Harvesting energy directly from the human body enables a new paradigm of self-sustainable power sources for implantable medical devices without being constrained by the battery's limited lifetime. Here, we report the design of a multibeam cardiac energy harvester using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-infilled microporous P(VDF-TrFE) composite films. We first added ZnO nanoparticles and multiwall carbon nanotubes into microporous P(VDF-TrFE) films to increase the energy output. The mixing ratios of 30% ZnO and 0.1% MWCNTs yielded 3.22 \u00b1 0.24 V output, which resulted in a voltage output 46 times higher than that of pure P(VDF-TrFE) films. Next, we discovered that the voltage generated by the composite film with PDMS is approximately 105% higher than that of the one without PDMS. For the application in cardiac pacemakers, we developed a facile fabrication method by building a cylindrical multibeam device that resides on the pacemaker lead to harvest energy from the complex motion of the lead driven by the heartbeat. Since the energy harvesting component is integrated into the pacemaker, it significantly reduces the risks and expenses associated with pacemaker-related surgeries.

We report a newly discovered function of piezoelectric bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) nanosheets for dissociating Alzheimer's \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregates through ultrasound-induced redox reactions. The accumulation of A\u03b2 aggregates (e.g., A\u03b2 fibrils, plaques) in the central nervous system is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, clearing A\u03b2 aggregates is considered a key for treating AD, but the dissociation of A\u03b2 aggregates is challenging due to their extremely robust structure consisting of \u03b2-sheets. BiOCl nanosheets are a biocompatible piezoelectric material with piezocatalytic activity in response to ultrasound. Our analyses using multiple spectroscopic and microscopic tools have revealed that BiOCl nanosheets effectively disassemble A\u03b2 fibrils under ultrasound stimulation. Sono-activated BiOCl nanosheets produce piezo-induced oxidative stress, which effectively destabilizes the \u03b2-sheets in A\u03b2 fibrils. In vitro evolution has also shown that sono-activated BiOCl nanosheets can effectively alleviate the neuro-toxicity of A\u03b2 fibrils.

The high graphene content induces the self-assembly of PVDF with a high \u03b2-phase content, which displays a unique self-piezoelectric property. Additionally, the membrane exhibits excellent electrical conductivity and unique capacitive properties, and the resultant nanochannels in the membrane can be reversibly adjusted by external voltage applications, resulting in the tailored gas selectivity of a single membrane. After the application of voltage to the membrane, the permeability and selectivity toward carbon dioxide increase simultaneously. Moreover, atomic-level positron annihilation spectroscopic studies reveal the piezoelectric effect on the free volume of the membrane, which helps us to formulate a gas permeation mechanism for the electrically responsive membrane.

Here, an effective encapsulation strategy was reported via a facile drop-casting and a following heat-assisted cross-linking process. Benefiting from the inherent hydrophobicity and the compact micro-structure of the cross-linked poly(vinylidene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), the as-encapsulated Li metal exhibited prominent stability toward moisture, as well corroborated by the evaluations both under the humid air at 25 \u00b0C with 30% relative humidity (RH) and pure water. Moreover, the encapsulated Li metal anode exhibits a decent electrochemical performance without substantially increasing the cell polarization due to the uniform and unblocked ion channels, which originally comes from the superior affinity of the PVDF-HFP polymer toward non-aqueous electrolyte. This work demonstrates a novel and valid encapsulation strategy for humidity-sensitive alkali metal electrodes, aiming to pave the way for the large-scale and low-cost deployment of the alkali metal-based high-energy-density batteries.", "journal": "Science bulletin", "date": "2020-06-15", "authors": ["YeXiao", "RuiXu", "ChongYan", "YeruLiang", "Jun-FanDing", "Jia-QiHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scib.2020.02.022"}

This study develops a thin film GaN-based acoustic tweezer (GaNAT) using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and demonstrates its acoustofluidic ability to pattern and manipulate microparticles. Although the piezoelectric performance of the GaNAT is compromised compared with conventional lithium niobate-based SAW devices, the inherited properties of GaN allow higher input powers and superior thermal stability. This study shows for the first time that thin film GaN is suitable for the fabrication of the acoustofluidic devices to manipulate microparticles with excellent performance. Numerical modelling of the acoustic pressure fields and the trajectories of mixtures of microparticles driven by the GaNAT was performed and the results were verified from the experimental studies using samples of polystyrene microspheres.

{"title": "Sound source localization by Ormia ochracea inspired low-noise piezoelectric MEMS directional microphone.", "abstract": "The single-tone sound source localization (SSL) by majority of fly Ormia ochracea's ears-inspired directional microphones leaves a limited choice when an application like hearing aid (HA) demands broadband SSL. Here, a piezoelectric MEMS directional microphone using a modified mechanical model of fly's ear has been presented with primary focus to achieve SSL in most sensitive audio bands to mitigate the constraints of traditional SSL works. In the modified model, two optimized rectangular diaphragms have been pivoted by four optimized torsional beams; while the backside of the whole structure has been etched. As a result, the SSL relative to angular rotation of the incoming sound depicts the cosine dependency as an ideal pressure-gradient sensor. At the same time, the mechanical coupling leads the magnitude difference between two diaphragms which has been accounted as SSL in frequency domain. The idea behind this work has been analytical simulated first, and with the convincing mechanical results, the designed bio-inspired directional microphone (BDM) has been fabricated using commercially available MEMSCAP based on PiezoMUMPS processes. In an anechoic chamber, the fabricated device has been excited in free-field sound, and the SSL at 1 kHz frequency, rocking frequency, bending frequency, and in-between rocking and bending frequencies has been found in full compliance with the given angle of incidence of sound. With the measured inter-aural sensitivity difference (mISD) and directionality, the developed BDM has been demonstrated as a practical SSL device, and the results have been found in a perfect match with the given angle of incidence of sound. Furthermore, to facilitate the SSL in noisy environment, the noise has been optimized in all scopes, like the geometry of the diaphragm, supportive torsional beam, and sensing. As a result, the A-weighted noise of this work has been found less than 23 dBA across the audio bands, and the equivalent-input noise (EIN) has been found to be 25.52 dB SPL at 1 kHz frequency which are the lowest ever reported by a similar device. With the developed SSL in broadband-in addition to the lowest noise-the developed device can be extended in some audio applications like an HA device.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-06-14", "authors": ["AshiqurRahaman", "ByungkiKim"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-66489-6\n10.1117/12.776519\n10.1121/1.3082118\n10.1186/s12938-018-0454-z\n10.1121/1.413830\n10.1016/j.cois.2018.09.002\n10.1038/srep02489\n10.1038/35070564\n10.1038/srep29957\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.618\n10.1121/1.3565473\n10.1063/1.4887370\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2845680\n10.1007/BF00193432\n10.1038/35070695\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2909501\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2873781\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.028\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.04.001\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2329136"}
{"title": "Effect of the Uniaxial Compression on the GaAs Nanowire Solar Cell.", "abstract": "Research regarding ways to increase solar cell efficiency is in high demand. Mechanical deformation of a nanowire (NW) solar cell can improve its efficiency. Here, the effect of uniaxial compression on GaAs nanowire solar cells was studied via conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) supported by numerical simulation. C-AFM I-V curves were measured for wurtzite p-GaAs NW grown on p-Si substrate. Numerical simulations were performed considering piezoresistance and piezoelectric effects. Solar cell efficiency reduction of 50% under a -0.5% strain was observed. The analysis demonstrated the presence of an additional fixed electrical charge at the NW/substrate interface, which was induced due to mismatch between the crystal lattices, thereby affecting the efficiency. Additionally, numerical simulations regarding the p-n GaAs NW solar cell under uniaxial compression were performed, showing that solar efficiency could be controlled by mechanical deformation and configuration of the wurtzite and zinc blende p-n segments in the NW. The relative solar efficiency was shown to be increased by 6.3% under -0.75% uniaxial compression.

Then we analyze the features of SEPAP and the factors impacting it by utilizing COMSOL.

In this paper, a novel nonlinear ultrasonic SHM method is introduced for localisation of impact damage in composite laminates using an array of surface-bonded sensors. Unlike existing algorithms, this method enables quick selection of a suitable signal transmission frequency based on the combined sensor-material response, it does not rely on baseline data or complex measurements of signal arrival time, and it allows identification of malfunctioning sensors to minimise damage localisation errors. The proposed technique is based on the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves through the inspected panel. Initially, the functionality of the transducers is inspected by comparing the signal amplitude in both directions of sensor-to-sensor paths. Then a planar map of material nonlinearity parameter \u03b2 is created, and the damage position is defined as the point of highest \u03b2 amplitude. Experimental tests on three CFRP panels confirmed successful positioning of barely visible impact damage (BVID) within a range of 4-22\u00a0mm. Sensor functionality check was demonstrated on one of the composite laminates, and a malfunctioning transducer was detected. The results suggested that the presented method could be considered an improved alternative to existing SHM techniques for localisation of BVID in composite panels.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-06-13", "authors": ["ChristosAndreades", "Gian PieroMalfense Fierro", "MicheleMeo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106181"}

The investigators hypothesized laser osteotomy would render acceptable bone healing based on the intraoperative findings and postoperative cut surface analysis.\nWe designed and implemented a comparative bone-cutting surgery in the minipig mandible with a cold ablation robot-guided Er:YAG laser osteotome (CARLO) and a piezoelectric (PZE) osteotome. The sample was composed of different patterns of defects in the mandibles of six grown-up female Goettingen minipigs. The predictor variable was Er:YAG osteotomy and PZE osteotomy. The outcome variable was the cut surface characteristics and bone healing at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Descriptive and qualitative comparison was executed.\nThe sample was composed of four kinds of bone defects on both sides of the mandibles of six minipigs. We observed more bleeding during the operation, open-cut surfaces, and a faster healing pattern with the laser osteotomy. There was a possible association between the intraoperative findings, postoperative cut surface analysis, and the bone healing pattern.\nThe results of this study suggest that characteristic open-cut surfaces could explain favorable bone healing after laser osteotomy. Future studies will focus on the quantification of the early healing characteristics after laser osteotomy, its diverse application, and the safety feature. Lasers Surg.

{"title": "Time-resolved open-circuit conductive atomic force microscopy for direct electromechanical characterisation.", "abstract": "Studying nanomaterial piezoelectricity and triboelectricity is attractive for energy and sensing applications. However, quantitative characterisation of electromechanical effects in nanomaterials is challenging due to practical limitations and possible combination of effects, resulting in contradicting reports at times. When it comes to piezoelectricity at the nanoscale, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is the default characterisation tool. In PFM the converse piezoelectric effect is measured - the conversion from electrical signal to mechanical response. However, there is an underlying desire to measure the direct piezoelectric effect - conversion of mechanical deformation to an electrical signal. This corresponds to energy harvesting and sensing. Here we present time-resolved open-circuit conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) as a new methodology to carry out direct electromechanical characterisation. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the standard short-circuit cAFM mode is inadequate for piezoelectric characterisation, and that resulting measurements are governed by competing mechanisms. We apply the new methodology to nanowires of GaAs, an important semiconductor, with relatively low piezoelectric coefficients. The results suggest that time-resolved operation distinguishes between triboelectric and piezoelectric signals, and that by measuring the open-circuit voltage rather than short-circuit current, the new methodology allows quantitative characterisation of the vertical piezoelectric coefficient.

Spider is one of the most vibration-sensitive creatures because of its hairlike sensilla and lyriform slit structure. Here, a spider-inspired ultrasensitive flexible vibration sensor is designed and fabricated for multifunctional sensing. The vibration sensitivity of the flexible sensor is increased over 2 orders of magnitude from 0.006 to 0.5 mV/g, and the strain sensitivity is hugely enhanced from 0.08 to 150 compared to a plain sensor counterpart. It is shown that the synergistic effect of cilium arrays and cracks is the key for achieving the greatly enhanced vibration and strain sensitivity. The dynamic sensitivity of 0.5 mV/g outperforms the corresponding commercial vibration sensors. The flexible sensor is demonstrated to be generally feasible for detecting vibration signals caused by walk, tumble, and explosion as well as capturing human body motions, indicating its great potential for applications in human health-monitoring devices, posture control in robotics, early earthquake warning, and so forth.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-06-11", "authors": ["Ya-FengLiu", "QunLiu", "Yuan-QingLi", "PeiHuang", "Jian-YaoYao", "NingHu", "Shao-YunFu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c08884"}

{"title": "Solution Blow Spinning of Polyvinylidene Fluoride Based Fibers for Energy Harvesting Applications: A Review.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based piezoelectric materials (PEMs) have found extensive applications in energy harvesting which are being extended consistently to diverse fields requiring strenuous service conditions. Hence, there is a pressing need to mass produce PVDF-based PEMs with the highest possible energy harvesting ability under a given set of conditions. To achieve high yield and efficiency, solution blow spinning (SBS) technique is attracting a lot of interest due to its operational simplicity and high throughput. SBS is arguably still in its infancy when the objective is to mass produce high efficiency PVDF-based PEMs. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the critical parameters regarding design and processing of SBS is essential. The key objective of this review is to critically analyze the key aspects of SBS to produce high efficiency PVDF-based PEMs. As piezoelectric properties of neat PVDF are not intrinsically much significant, various additives are commonly incorporated to enhance its piezoelectricity. Therefore, PVDF-based copolymers and nanocomposites are also included in this review. We discuss both theoretical and experimental results regarding SBS process parameters such as solvents, dissolution methods, feed rate, viscosity, air pressure and velocity, and nozzle design. Morphological features and mechanical properties of PVDF-based nanofibers were also discussed and important applications have been presented. For completeness, key findings from electrospinning were also included. At the end, some insights are given to better direct the efforts in the field of PVDF-based PEMs using SBS technique.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2020-06-11", "authors": ["RasheedAtif", "JibranKhaliq", "MadeleineCombrinck", "Ahmed HHassanin", "NaderShehata", "EmanElnabawy", "IslamShyha"], "doi": "10.3390/polym12061304\n10.12693/APhysPolA.130.133\n10.1016/B978-0-08-102572-7.00002-7\n10.1007/s40722-014-0008-9\n10.1080/10408438008243576\n10.1070/RCR4860\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1021/acsami.7b08541\n10.1002/adfm.201402270\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.045\n10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7181322\n10.1143/JJAP.8.975\n10.1021/cr800187m\n10.1007/s10853-015-8986-0\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1039/c3ee41360h\n10.1063/1.5028756\n10.1021/ma011744f\n10.1063/1.2812702\n10.1021/la801617q\n10.7567/1882-0786/ab207b\n10.1109/ICSD.2010.5567941\n10.1039/C3RA45134H\n10.3390/polym10020161\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.09.117\n10.1080/00405000.2017.1377882\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.1021/acsami.6b12994\n10.3390/molecules24101903\n10.3390/jmmp3030077\n10.5772/62433\n10.3390/polym9020033\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2016.12.003\n10.1002/0471216275.esm063\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.065\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.04.118\n10.3390/polym7081444\n10.3762/bjnano.7.109\n10.1155/2015/561742\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.08.266\n10.3390/nano8090743\n10.1021/nn505306h\n10.1002/app.30275\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.12.020\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.10.021\n10.1021/acsami.7b08008\n10.1021/acsami.7b17408\n10.1039/c2nr11841f\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02441\n10.1002/ente.201600419\n10.1088/1361-6528/aa5217\n10.1039/C5NR00453E\n10.1039/C5RA25671B\n10.3390/polym8080281\n10.1007/s11595-017-1696-5\n10.1063/1.5028767\n10.1016/j.clay.2014.06.025\n10.1039/C5RA24039E\n10.1177/1045389X14529609\n10.1002/pat.4463\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085017\n10.1021/acsomega.9b00243\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.10.031\n10.1039/C5CP01207D\n10.1021/acsnano.6b07961\n10.1021/jp504938f\n10.1002/pi.5347\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.07.001\n10.1002/pc.24916\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.07.047\n10.1007/978-3-642-36427-3_2\n10.3390/polym9120718\n10.1002/polb.24312\n10.1134/S1811238218020200\n10.1134/S0021364015100136\n10.1063/1.4949661\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.043\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.050\n10.3390/mi8040097\n10.1002/app.47049\n10.1080/1539445X.2019.1582542\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.07.053\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.02.004\n10.1038/s41598-017-19082-3\n10.1080/00405000.2016.1202091\n10.1186/s11671-019-2906-1\n10.3390/polym10070745\n10.1039/C8TC05090B\n10.1002/app.31488\n10.1063/1.1333035\n10.1002/app.43025\n10.1002/app.30938\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.06.031\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.06.048\n10.1016/j.matpr.2018.04.182\n10.1039/C6RA00739B\n10.1007/s10854-017-7491-4\n10.1002/app.39317\n10.1021/ie4037142\n10.1063/1.5084115\n10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2018.12.001\n10.3390/e16115810\n10.1007/s12221-017-7213-9\n10.1002/app.34760\n10.3390/polym10080856\n10.1007/s00397-016-0980-1\n10.1134/S0021364020010051\n10.4236/graphene.2016.52011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.11.036\n10.1021/acs.iecr.5b04277\n10.1039/c2nr11430e\n10.1021/nl0486158\n10.1002/adma.200903870\n10.3390/polym10090965\n10.1017/S0022112069002540\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2006.01.014\n10.1017/S0022112010004738\n10.1016/j.polymer.2006.04.050\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.10.042\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00072\n10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.080\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.02.011\n10.3390/polym6061846\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00610-X\n10.1186/2194-0517-2-13\n10.2217/nnm.10.31\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.05.084\n10.1007/s11837-018-2811-6\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2004.01.025\n10.1007/s10570-016-1070-3\n10.1021/acsanm.8b00938\n10.1109/ICPADM.2015.7295227\n10.1016/j.cej.2013.10.038\n10.1039/C5RA03524D\n10.1016/S0266-3538(96)00181-9\n10.1016/j.jmps.2010.02.007\n10.1038/nmat4423\n10.1021/nl9040719\n10.1039/c1jm11445j\n10.1002/marc.201100040\n10.1007/s10854-017-8387-z\n10.1163/156856204322752228\n10.1039/C7CY01638G\n10.1039/C6RA28563E\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.01.012\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.04.026\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.10.034\n10.1039/c1ee02241e\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.049\n10.1039/C8NR05292A"}
{"title": "Effect of Filler Alignment on Piezo-Resistive and Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotube Composites.", "abstract": "Highly aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) polymer composites were fabricated via a roll-to-roll milling process; the alignment of the MWCNTs could be controlled by varying the speed of the rotating rolls. The effect of MWCNT alignment on the polymer matrix was morphologically observed and quantitatively characterized using polarized Raman spectroscopy. To provide a more detailed comparison, MWCNT composites with alignment in the transverse direction and random alignment were fabricated and tested.

The associated sensing characteristics, departing from conventional resonant acoustic sensors, could be of tremendous interest for the development of high sensitivity, broadband audible sensors for applications in environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and internet-of-things. Herein, a low packing density, freely suspended nanofiber mesh with a piezoelectric active polymer is fabricated, demonstrating a self-powered acoustic sensing platform with broad sensitivity bandwidth covering 200-5000 Hz at hearing-safe sound pressure levels.

With the ability to span the nanomesh across a suspension distance of 3 mm with minimized fiber stacking (\u224818% fiber packing density), individual nanofibers can freely imitate the acoustic-driven fluctuation of airflow in a collective manner, where piezoelectricity is harvested at two-terminal electrodes for direct signal collection.

{"title": "Modeling and compensation of hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuator has the advantages of high rigidity, wide bandwidth, fast response and high resolution. Therefore, they are widely used in many micro and nano positioning applications. However, the hysteresis characteristic in the piezoelectric actuator (PEA) seriously affects its positioning accuracy and even causes instability. In this paper, a modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MPI) model, which can describe the rate asymmetric hysteresis of piezoelectric actuator, is studied. The hysteresis compensation is realized by using the rate dependent Prandtl-Iishlinskii model based on the improved Prandtl-Iishlinskii hysteresis model and the hysteresis characteristics of the driver measured in the laboratory under the frequency input of up to 100 Hz. In order to further reduce the error of feedforward compensation, a sliding mode controller is designed. The stability of the control system is proved by Lyapunov theory.

{"title": "Breaking the resolution limit in photoacoustic imaging using non-negativity and sparsity.", "abstract": "The spatial resolution achievable in photoacoustic imaging decreases with the imaging depth, resulting in blurred images for deeper structures. Apart from technical limitations, the ultimate resolution limit results from the second law of thermodynamics. The attenuation of the optically generated acoustic waves on their way from the imaged structure to the sample surface by scattering and dissipation leads to an increase of entropy. The resulting loss of spatial resolution for structures embedded in attenuating media can be compensated by numerical methods that make use of additional available information. In this article, we demonstrate this using experimental data from plane one-dimensional (1D) acoustic waves propagating in fat tissue. The acoustic waves are optically induced by nanosecond laser pulses and measured with piezoelectric transducers. The experimental results of 1D compensation are also relevant for photoacoustic imaging in 2D or 3D in an acoustically attenuating medium by dividing the reconstruction problem into two steps: First, the ideal signal, which is the solution of the un-attenuated wave equation, is determined by the proposed 1D attenuation compensation for each detector signal. In a second step, any ultrasound reconstruction method for un-attenuated data can be used for image reconstruction. For the reconstruction of a small step milled into a silicon wafer surface, which allows the generation of two photoacoustic pulses with a small time offset, we take advantage of non-negativity and sparsity and inverted the measured, frequency dependent acoustic attenuation of the fat tissue. We were able to improve the spatial resolution for imaging through 20\u2009mm of porcine fat tissue compared to the diffraction limit at the cut-off frequency by at least a factor of two.", "journal": "Photoacoustics", "date": "2020-06-09", "authors": ["PBurgholzer", "JBauer-Marschallinger", "MHaltmeier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pacs.2020.100191"}

However, achieving a constant lateral resolution over a large depth of field for deeply penetrating photoacoustic macroscopy is still a challenge. In this work, a detector design for scanning photoacoustic macroscopy is presented. Based on simulation results, a sensor array geometry is developed and fabricated that consists of concentric ring elements made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in a geometry that combines a centered planar ring with several inclined outer ring elements. The reconstruction algorithm, which uses dynamic focusing and coherence weighting, is explained and its capability to reduce artefacts occurring for single element conical sensors is demonstrated. Several phantoms are manufactured to evaluate the performance of the array in experimental measurements. The sensor array provides a constant axial and lateral resolution of 95 \u00b5m and 285 \u00b5m, respectively, over a depth of field of 20 mm. The depth of field corresponds approximately to the maximum imaging depth in biological tissue, estimated from the sensitivity of the array.

The main outcomes measures were success rates in ED (International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function change, conversion of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors non-responders) and PD (change in deviation and plaque size), differences of used sources of energy, and energy flux densities (EFDs).\n3 different sources of energies are used, that is electromagnetic, electrohydraulic, and piezoelectric .The devices markedly distinguish in the available spectrum of the EFD ranging between 0.09 and 0.55 mJ/mm\u00b2. In terms of the biological effects, the relevant energy parameters are\u00a0-6 dB and the 5 MPa focus, which differ substantially between the ESWT devices. In addition, a great variability in the treatment protocols and applied energy is obvious. The preliminary own experiences with low intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy in 160 ED non-responders and 190 patients with PD with success rates of 45% and 47%, respectively, are reported.\nPositive results were published with all 6 ESWT devices in question in patients with organic ED but with huge differences regarding the EFD and the total energies applied. There is growing evidence that concentrated treatment protocols and increasing energies may yield better results. In this context, it may be argued that at least some of the published studies were markedly underpowered .Owing to the paucity of published studies, the literature of the effects of ESWT in PD and for penile rehabilitation after pelvic surgery is currently not conclusive.

The rats in the PYC group were treated with 100 mg/kg PYC by intraperitoneal injection 15\u00a0minutes after SCI. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was used to evaluate locomotor activity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were detected by ELISA. The expression of Cleaved-caspase 3, Bcl-2, Bax and the levels of Cytochrome c (Cyt-c) were analysed by Western blot or Immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we used the JC-1 fluorescent probe to analyse the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m).\nThe rats that received PYC had significantly higher BBB scores than the control lesion rats. PYC treatment resulted in reduced bleeding in spinal cord tissue and proliferation of glial cells, greater numbers of anterior horn neurons, more complete structures of residual neurons, and significant improvement in Nissl body morphology. In addition, PYC reduced MDA production and increased SOD activity. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was significantly increased in the PYC treatment group compared with the SCI group. In addition, PYC decreased the expression of Cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax and the release of Cyt-c and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in the SCI rats.\nThe above findings suggested that PYC can improve motor function and reduce neuronal apoptosis after SCI by stabilizing the MMP through the inhibition of oxidative stress.\nDMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; IHC: immunological histological chemistry; MDA: malondialdehyde; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; PYC: Pycnogenol; RIPA: radio immunoprecipitation assay; SCI: spinal cord injury; SOD: superoxide dismutase.", "journal": "Neurological research", "date": "2020-06-05", "authors": ["LinTao", "XuanLiu", "WaciliDa", "ZhengboTao", "YueZhu"], "doi": "10.1080/01616412.2020.1773610"}
{"title": "A Three-Dimensional Nano-web Scaffold of Ferroelectric Beta-PVDF Fibers for Lithium Metal Plating and Stripping.", "abstract": "Lithium metal has been considered as an anode material to improve energy densities of lithium chemistry-based rechargeable batteries (that is to say, lithium metal batteries or LMBs). Higher capacities and cell voltages are ensured by replacing practically used anode materials such as graphite with lithium metal. However, lithium metal as the LMB anode material has been challenged by its dendritic growth, electrolyte decomposition on its fresh surface, and its serious volumetric change. To address the problems of lithium metal anodes, herein, we guided and facilitated lithium ion transport along a spontaneously polarized and highly dielectric material. A three-dimensional web of nanodiameter fibers of ferroelectric beta-phase polyvinylidene fluoride (beta-PVDF) was loaded on a copper foil by electrospinning (PVDF#Cu). The electric field applied between the nozzle and target copper foil forced the dipoles of PVDF to be oriented centro-asymmetrically and then the beta structure induced ferroelectric polarization. Three-fold benefits of the ferroelectric nano-web architecture guaranteed the plating/stripping reversibility especially at high rates: (1) three-dimensional scaffold to accommodate the volume change of lithium metal during plating and stripping, (2) electrolyte channels between fibers to allow lithium ions to move, and (3) ferroelectrically polarized or negatively charged surface of beta-PVDF fibers to encourage lithium ion hopping along the surface. Resultantly, the beta-PVDF web architecture drove dense and integrated growth of lithium metal within its structure. The kinetic benefit expected from the ferroelectric lithium ion transport of beta-PVDF as well as the porous architecture of PVDF#Cu was realized in a cell of LFP as a cathode and lithium-plated PVDF#Cu as an anode. Excellent plating/stripping reversibility along repeated cycles was successfully demonstrated in the cell even at a high current such as 2.3 mA cm", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-06-05", "authors": ["ChihyunHwang", "Woo-JinSong", "GyujinSong", "YutongWu", "SangyeopLee", "Hye BinSon", "JonghakKim", "NianLiu", "SoojinPark", "Hyun-KonSong"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c05065"}

{"title": "Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia: Visualising the Nerve and Needle.", "abstract": "Regional anaesthesia involves targeting specific peripheral nerves with local anaesthetic. It facilitates the delivery of anaesthesia and analgesia to an increasingly complex, elderly and co-morbid patient population. Regional anaesthesia practice has been transformed by the use of ultrasound, which confers advantages such as accuracy of needle placement, visualisation of local anaesthetic spread, avoidance of intraneural injection and the ability to accommodate for anatomical variation.An US beam is generated by the application of electrical current to an array of piezoelectric crystals, causing vibration and consequential production of high-frequency sound waves. The sound energy is reflected at tissue interfaces, detected by the piezoelectric crystals in the ultrasound probe, and most frequently displayed as a 2D image.Optimising image acquisition involves selection of the appropriate US frequency: this represents a trade-off between image resolution (better with high frequency) and tissue penetration/beam attenuation (better with low frequency). Altering alignment, rotation and tilt of the probe is often required to optimise the view as nerves are best visualised when the ultrasound beam is directly perpendicular to their fibres. Adjusting the focus, depth, and gain (brightness) of the image display can also help in this matter.Three key challenges exist in regional anaesthesia; image optimisation, image interpretation (nerve visualisation) and needle visualisation. There are characteristic sonographic appearances of the nerve structures for peripheral nerve blocks, as discussed in this chapter, and the above techniques can be used to enhance their appearance. Much research has been done, and is ongoing, with the aim of improving needle visualisation; this is also reviewed. Image interpretation requires the application of anatomical knowledge and understanding of the typical sonographic appearance of different tissues (as well as the needle). Years of practice are required to attain expertise, although it is hoped that continuing advances in nerve and needle visualisation, as described in this chapter, will expedite that process.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2020-06-04", "authors": ["JamesBowness", "AlasdairTaylor"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-37639-0_2"}

The coarse approach of the STM is realized by using an inertial piezoelectric motor, and the scanning is realized by using a miniature scanner, which stands alone on a sapphire base. A combined vibration isolation system consisting of a brick-rubber-brick stack and two springs is used to isolate the vibration generated from the magnet. An enclosed copper shield is used to prevent sound from entering the tip-sample junction. The sound and vibration isolation measures highly improve the stability of the STM imaging. All the materials selected to construct the STM head are nonmagnetic. The drift rates of the STM in the X-Y plane and Z direction are as low as 26.2 pm/min and 34.6 pm/min, respectively, under ambient conditions. The high performance of the homebuilt STM was demonstrated by graphite hexagonal lattice images obtained in magnet fields ranging from 0 T to 27.5 T even without the protection of a vacuum and low temperatures.

This filter is realized as a 24th-order IIR filter on the FPGA, while the total input-output delay is kept at 350 ns. The combination of the inverse filter and the piezoelectric transducer works as a nearly flat response position actuator, allowing us to use a proportional-integral (PI) control in order to achieve stability of the closed-loop system with significant improvements over a non-filtered PI control.

A new piezoelectric actuator based on a two-stage flexible hinge structure is proposed. The piezoelectric actuator uses a combination of a lever flexible hinge and a triangular flexible hinge. The working stroke and speed of the actuator are enlarged by the lever flexible hinge, and the output force of the piezoelectric stack is perpendicular to and greater than the clamping force between the driving foot and the slider through the triangular flexible hinge, which enhances the load capacity of the actuator. First, the structure and working principle of the piezoelectric actuator are presented. The lateral output displacement of the piezoelectric ceramic stack is amplified by the lever amplification structure so that the triangular flexible hinge structure is then used to convert the lateral displacement into a coupled motion composed of longitudinal and lateral displacement to drive the slide rail to generate total displacement. Then, the superiority of the piezoelectric actuator was verified through the analysis of displacement amplification and clamping force and finite element analysis. Finally, the performance of the piezoelectric actuator is studied. It can produce an output speed of 354.55 mm/s under a driving voltage of 4.7 kHz and 150 V, and the maximum load can reach 3 kg.

The exciting signals used in the piezoelectric transducer in the horizontal and vertical directions are both sinusoidal signals, possessing a phase shift of \u03c0/2. Two third-order orthogonal bending in-plane modes of the same frequency were effectively excited, and an elliptic motion formed on the end plane of the vibrator toothed structure. A flexible body was then effectively driven by friction under a certain amount of tension. The proposed vibrator was designed using the finite element method, and the flexible drive models were established, while the output force in the contact friction was analyzed. The vibration characteristics of the vibrator were tested in order to obtain the resonance frequencies and responses. An experimental system was then established to test the mechanical output characteristics. The results demonstrate that the difference in thickness, tension force, and surface roughness between the flexible bodies confer great influence on driving.

The use of atom-centered basis functions allows treating 3D (crystals), 2D (slabs), 1D (polymers), and 0D (molecules) systems on the same grounds. In turn, all-electron calculations are inherently permitted along with pseudopotential strategies. A variety of density functionals are implemented, including global and range-separated hybrids of various natures and, as an extreme case, Hartree-Fock (HF). The cost for HF or hybrids is only about 3-5 times higher than when using the local density approximation or the generalized gradient approximation. Symmetry is fully exploited at all steps of the calculation. Many tools are available to modify the structure as given in input and simplify the construction of complicated objects, such as slabs, nanotubes, molecules, and clusters. Many tensorial properties can be evaluated by using a single input keyword: elastic, piezoelectric, photoelastic, dielectric, first and second hyperpolarizabilities, etc. The calculation of infrared and Raman spectra is available, and the intensities are computed analytically. Automated tools are available for the generation of the relevant configurations of solid solutions and/or disordered systems. Three versions of the code exist: serial, parallel, and massive-parallel. In the second one, the most relevant matrices are duplicated on each core, whereas in the third one, the Fock matrix is distributed for diagonalization.

One of the most common methods used for space charge measurements is the Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) method. This paper analyzes two factors that influence the electromagnetic interference on the piezoelectric signal. These factors are the connection of the injected pulsed voltage at the PEA test cell and the grounding of the PEA test cell.

{"title": "Transducer modeling for accurate acoustic simulations of transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation.", "abstract": "Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is emerging as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique with superior spatial resolution and the ability to reach deep brain areas. Medical image-based computational modeling could be an important tool for individualized TUS dose control and targeting optimization, but requires further validation. This study aims to assess the impact of the transducer model on the accuracy of the simulations.\nUsing hydrophone measurements, the acoustic beam of a single-element focused transducer (SEFT) with a flat piezoelectric disc and an acoustic lens was characterized. The acoustic beam was assessed in a homogeneous water bath and after transmission through obstacles (3D-printed shapes and skull samples). The acoustic simulations employed the finite-difference time-domain method and were informed by computed tomography (CT) images of the obstacles. Transducer models of varying complexity were tested representing the SEFT either as a surface boundary condition with variable curvature or also accounting for its internal geometry. In addition, a back-propagated pressure distribution from the first measurement plane was used as source model. The simulations and measurements were quantitatively compared using key metrics for peak location, focus size, intensity and spatial distribution.\nWhile a surface boundary with an adapted, 'effective' curvature radius based on the specifications given by the manufacturer could reproduce the measured focus location and size in a homogeneous water bath, it regularly failed to accurately predict the beam after obstacle transmission. In contrast, models that were based on a one-time calibration to the homogeneous water bath measurements performed substantially better in all cases with obstacles. For one of the 3D-printed obstacles, the simulated intensities deviated substantially from the measured ones, irrespective of the transducer model. We attribute this finding to a standing wave effect, and further studies should clarify its relevance for accurate simulations of skull transmission.\nValidated transducer models are important to ensure accurate simulations of the acoustic beam of SEFTs, in particular in the presence of obstacles such as the skull.", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "date": "2020-06-03", "authors": ["CristinaPasquinelli", "HazaelMontanaro", "Hyunjoo JLee", "Lars GHanson", "HyungkookKim", "NielsKuster", "Hartwig RSiebner", "EsraNeufeld", "AxelThielscher"], "doi": "10.1088/1741-2552/ab98dc"}

{"title": "Fatigue-Crack Detection and Monitoring through the Scattered-Wave Two-Dimensional Cross-Correlation Imaging Method Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric transducers are convenient enablers for generating and receiving Lamb waves for damage detection. Fatigue cracks are one of the most common causes for the failure of metallic structures. Increasing emphasis on the integrity of critical structures creates an urgent need to monitor structures and to detect cracks at an early stage to prevent catastrophic failures. This paper presents a two-dimensional (2D) cross-correlation imaging technique that can not only detect a fatigue crack but can also precisely image the fatigue cracks in metallic structures. The imaging method was based on the cross-correlation algorithm that uses incident waves and the crack-scattered waves of all directions to generate the crack image. Fatigue testing for crack generation was then conducted in both an aluminum plate and a stainless-steel plate. Piezoelectric wafer transducer was used to actuate the interrogating Lamb wave. To obtain the scattered waves as well as the incident waves, a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer was adopted for acquiring time-space multidimensional wavefield, followed with frequency-wavenumber processing. The proof-of-concept study was conducted in an aluminum plate with a hairline fatigue crack.

{"title": "Macrovoid-Inhibited PVDF Hollow Fiber Membranes via Spinning Process Delay for Direct Contact Membrane Distillation.", "abstract": "A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane was fabricated through water-induced dope crystallization by allowing a facile spinning process delay (SPD) in the nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) process for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The SPD was achieved by the addition of a small amount of water to the PVDF dope solution that was held in a closed container for a particular time. The crystalline property of the PVDF dope solution was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The obtained PVDF hollow fiber membranes were characterized with different techniques, including field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and the mechanical strength. Both the formation mechanism and properties were studied for the membranes with different SPD times. The results showed that macrovoid-inhibited PVDF membranes were obtained from 12 days of the SPD via the crystallization-dominated membrane formation process. The obtained membrane 4D-12 exhibited desirable membrane structure and properties for DCMD, which includes an improved liquid entry pressure of 2.25 bar, a surface water contact angle of 129\u00b0, a maximum pore size of 0.40 \u03bcm, and a mean pore size of 0.34 \u03bcm. The membrane 4D-12 possessed a twofold increase in both energy efficiency and permeate water flux in DCMD and stable permeate water flux and salt rejection through 224 h of continuous desalination operation. Compared to the commonly used approach by adding chemicals to the external coagulant, the SPD method provided a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative to pursuing the macrovoid-free PVDF membranes for DCMD.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-05-30", "authors": ["LusiZou", "PriGusnawan", "Ying-BingJiang", "GuoyinZhang", "JianjiaYu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c06902"}

The resulting thermoacoustic signal has been subsequently obtained by solving the thermoacoustic equation. The acoustic propagation has been simulated by FEM methods in the brain and the skull, where a set of piezoelectric sensors are placed.

{"title": "Nanoscale piezoelectric effect of biodegradable PLA-based composite fibers by piezoresponse force microscopy.", "abstract": "The piezoelectricity of the biocompatible and biodegradable polymer polylactic acid (PLA) was investigated as a potential magnetoelectric (ME) nanocomposite for biomedical applications. A key focus was to quantify the piezoelectric properties of single PLA fibers while tuning their polymer degradability through the addition of faster degrading polymer, poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), which is not a piezoelectric polymer. Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) showed that electrospun PLA fibers gave a piezoelectric response of 186 \u00b1 28 pm. For comparison both PLA/PLGA (75/25) and PLA/PLGA (50/50) fibers gave significantly lower piezoelectric responses of 89 \u00b1 12 pm and 50 \u00b1 9.1 pm, respectively. For the highest content PLGA fibers, PLA/PLGA (25/75), only very few fibers exhibited a low response of 28 pm while most showed no response. Overall, an increasing PLGA content caused a decrease in the piezoelectric response, thus an expected trade-off existed between the biodegradability (i.e. PLA to PLGA content ratio) versus piezoelectricity. The findings were considered significant due to the existence of piezoelectricity in a tuneable biodegradable material that has potential to impart piezoelectric induced effects on biointeractions with the surrounding biological environment or drug interactions with the polymer to control the rate of drug release. In such applications, there is an opportunity to magnetically control the piezoelectricity and henceforth PLA/CoFe", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2020-05-28", "authors": ["TianZheng", "ZhilianYue", "Gordon GWallace", "YiDu", "Michael JHiggins"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab96e3"}
{"title": "Classification of standing and sitting phases based on in-socket piezoelectric sensors in a transfemoral amputee.", "abstract": "A transfemoral prosthesis is required to assist amputees to perform the activity of daily living (ADL). The passive prosthesis has some drawbacks such as utilization of high metabolic energy. In contrast, the active prosthesis consumes less metabolic energy and offers better performance. However, the recent active prosthesis uses surface electromyography as its sensory system which has weak signals with microvolt-level intensity and requires a lot of computation to extract features. This paper focuses on recognizing different phases of sitting and standing of a transfemoral amputee using in-socket piezoelectric-based sensors. 15 piezoelectric film sensors were embedded in the inner socket wall adjacent to the most active regions of the agonist and antagonist knee extensor and flexor muscles, i.\u00a0e. region with the highest level of muscle contractions of the quadriceps and hamstring. A male transfemoral amputee wore the instrumented socket and was instructed to perform several sitting and standing phases using an armless chair. Data was collected from the 15 embedded sensors and went through signal conditioning circuits. The overlapping analysis window technique was used to segment the data using different window lengths. Fifteen time-domain and frequency-domain features were extracted and new feature sets were obtained based on the feature performance. Eight of the common pattern recognition multiclass classifiers were evaluated and compared. Regression analysis was used to investigate the impact of the number of features and the window lengths on the classifiers' accuracies, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test significant differences in the classifiers' performances. The classification accuracy was calculated using k-fold cross-validation method, and 20% of the data set was held out for testing the optimal classifier. The results showed that the feature set (FS-5) consisting of the root mean square (RMS) and the number of peaks (NP) achieved the highest classification accuracy in five classifiers. Support vector machine (SVM) with cubic kernel proved to be the optimal classifier, and it achieved a classification accuracy of 98.33 % using the test data set. Obtaining high classification accuracy using only two time-domain features would significantly reduce the processing time of controlling a prosthesis and eliminate substantial delay. The proposed in-socket sensors used to detect sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements could be further integrated with an active knee joint actuation system to produce powered assistance during energy-demanding activities such as sit-to-stand and stair climbing. In future, the system could also be used to accurately predict the intended movement based on their residual limb's muscle and mechanical behaviour as detected by the in-socket sensory system.", "journal": "Biomedizinische Technik.

A range of inserts, largely different in shape and length, were allowed to treat deep and difficult-to-reach sites. Two mechanical complications occurred. Average blood loss in dogs' group was 52, 47, and 56 mL for traumatic, degenerative, and neoplastic lesions, respectively, whereas it was 25 mL for traumatized cats. A fast recovery of functions was observed in most of the treated cases, early on, at the first sixth-month evaluation. Histology on bone flaps showed the presence of live osteocytes and osteoblasts at the osteotomized surface in 92% of cases.\nPiezosurgery is based on the physical principle of the indirect piezo effect. Piezoelectric osteotomy is selective, effective, and safe in bone cutting during neurosurgical veterinary procedures.

{"title": "Self-Powered Sensors and Systems Based on Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Sensor networks are essential for the development of the Internet of Things and the smart city. A general sensor, especially a mobile sensor, has to be driven by a power unit. When considering the high mobility, wide distribution and wireless operation of the sensors, their sustainable operation remains a critical challenge owing to the limited lifetime of an energy storage unit. In 2006, Wang proposed the concept of self-powered sensors/system, which harvests ambient energy to continuously drive a sensor without the use of an external power source. Based on the piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), extensive studies have focused on self-powered sensors. TENG and PENG, as effective mechanical-to-electricity energy conversion technologies, have been used not only as power sources but also as active sensing devices in many application fields, including physical sensors, wearable devices, biomedical and health care, human-machine interface, chemical and environmental monitoring, smart traffic, smart cities, robotics, and fiber and fabric sensors. In this review, we systematically summarize the progress made by TENG and PENG in those application fields. A perspective will be given about the future of self-powered sensors.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-28", "authors": ["ZhiyiWu", "TinghaiCheng", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi":

{"title": "Using Wearable Inertial Sensors to Estimate Kinematic Parameters and Variability in the Table Tennis Topspin Forehand Stroke.", "abstract": "The study examined kinematic parameters and their inter- and intrasubject variability in the topspin forehand of seven top-level table tennis players. A wireless inertial measurement unit (IMU) system measured the movement of the playing hand to analyze the Ready position, Backswing, and Forward events, and a racket-mounted piezoelectric sensor captured the racket-ball Contact. In a four-phase cycle (Backswing, Hitting, Followthrough, and Back to Ready position), body sensors recorded the cycle and phase duration; angles in the sagittal plane at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist of the playing hand and at the knee joints; and acceleration of the playing hand at the moment of racket-ball contact. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to determine the variability of kinematic parameters within and between players. The observed variability in stroke time duration was low (CV < 20%) indicating constancy. The small-to-medium intraindividual variability of angles (CV < 40%) indicates that each player used a broadly repeatable technique. The large intraindividual variability in movement was probably functional (i.e., motor adjustment and injury avoidance). Interindividual and intraindividual variability of knee and elbow angles was low; wrist extension was the most variable parameter (CV > 40%) for all tasks, and shoulder joint variability was medium-to-large. Variability in hand acceleration was low (CV < 20%). Individual players achieved relatively constant hand acceleration at the moment of contact, possibly because angular changes at one joint (e.g., shoulder) could be compensated for by changes at another (e.g., wrist).

The wave response is acquired by a piezoelectric sensor network, which is attached to the plate. After performing numerical and physical experiments, enough data are collected in order to train an artificial neural network and a support vector machine. Those machine learning algorithms will predict the impact position based on the wave response of each sensor, while only numerical data from the finite element simulations are used to train both methods. After the training process is completed, the algorithms are applied to experimental data. A good agreement between reference and predicted results proves that the wave responses at the piezoelectric transducers contain sufficient information in order to localize the impact position precisely.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-05-27", "authors": ["Daniel FrankHesser", "Georg KarlKocur", "BerndMarkert"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106144"}

{"title": "Magnetic Adjustment of Afterload in Engineered Heart Tissues.", "abstract": "Afterload is known to drive the development of both physiological and pathological cardiac states. As such, studying the outcomes of altered afterload states could yield important insights into the mechanisms controlling these critical processes. However, an experimental technique for precisely fine-tuning afterload in heart tissue over time is currently lacking. Here, a newly developed magnetics-based technique for achieving this control in engineered heart tissues (EHTs) is described. In order to produce magnetically responsive EHTs (MR-EHTs), the tissues are mounted on hollow silicone posts, some of which contain small permanent magnets. A second set of permanent magnets is press-fit into an acrylic plate such that they are oriented with the same polarity and are axially-aligned with the post magnets. To adjust afterload, this plate of magnets is translated toward (higher afterload) or away (lower afterload) from the post magnets using a piezoelectric stage fitted with an encoder. The motion control software used to adjust stage positioning allows for the development of user-defined afterload regimens while the encoder ensures that the stage corrects for any inconsistencies in its location. This work describes the fabrication, calibration, and implementation of this system to enable the development of similar platforms in other labs around the world.

{"title": "Isolating Myofibrils from Skeletal Muscle Biopsies and Determining Contractile Function with a Nano-Newton Resolution Force Transducer.", "abstract": "Striated muscle cells are indispensable for the activity of humans and animals. Single muscle fibers are comprised of myofibrils, which consist of serially linked sarcomeres, the smallest contractile units in muscle. Sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in patients with mutations in genes encoding for sarcomeric proteins. The study of myofibril mechanics allows for the assessment of actin-myosin interactions without potential confounding effects of damaged, adjacent myofibrils when measuring the contractility of single muscle fibers. Ultrastructural damage and misalignment of myofibrils might contribute to impaired contractility. If structural damage is present in the myofibrils, they likely break during the isolation procedure or during the experiment. Furthermore, studies in myofibrils provide the assessment of actin-myosin interactions in the presence of the geometrical constraints of the sarcomeres. For instance, measurements in myofibrils can elucidate whether myofibrillar dysfunction is the primary effect of a mutation in a sarcomeric protein. In addition, perfusion with calcium solutions or compounds is almost instant due to the small diameter of the myofibril. This makes myofibrils eminently suitable to measure the rates of activation and relaxation during force production. The protocol described in this paper employs an optical force probe based on the principle of a Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer capable of measuring forces in the nano-Newton range, coupled to a piezo length motor and a fast-step perfusion system. This setup enables the study of myofibril mechanics with high resolution force measurements.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-05-26", "authors": ["Martijnvan de Locht", "Josine Mde Winter", "Dilson ERassier", "Michiel H BHelmes", "Coen A COttenheijm"], "doi": "10.3791/61002"}

For decades, the trephine technique has been used with no notable refinements in the procedure. The use of piezoelectric surgical equipment has increased in human clinical oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, traumatology, and orthopedics, because the devices are easy to handle, and can cut bone without damaging sensitive soft tissues such as blood vessels, nerves, and membranes. This study evaluated and compared the surgical technique and bone regeneration process between a traditional hand-drill trephine and piezoelectric equipment in a critical-size calvaria defect in a rat model. Thirty SD male rats were randomly divided into two groups and had either a 7.9mm diameter circular defect created with trephine or a 7.0mm square defect using the piezoelectric device, both creating 49 mm2 defect areas. MicroCT and histology were performed at 45 and 75d after surgery. While trephine surgeries were performed faster than piezoelectric (25.5 minutes vs 38.5 minutes), the rate of complications was much higher, with 36% of trephine rats taking 20 minutes to achieve hemostasis. Although the extent of new bone formation was similar between the two surgical groups, the piezoelectric technique resulted in 50% less variability. No additional new bone formation was observed from 45 to 75d in both techniques.

{"title": "Real-time monitoring of bacterial biofilms metabolic activity by a redox-reactive nanosensors array.", "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms are communities of surface-associated microorganisms living in cellular clusters or micro-colonies, encapsulated in a complex matrix composed of an extracellular polymeric substance, separated by open water channels that act as a circulatory system that enable better diffusion of nutrients and easier removal of metabolic waste products. The monitoring of biofilms can provide important information on fundamental biofilm-related processes. That information can shed light on the bacterial processes and enable scientists to find ways of preventing future bacterial infections. Various approaches in use for biofilm analysis are based on microscopic, spectrochemical, electrochemical, and piezoelectrical methods. All these methods provide significant progress in understanding the bio-process related to biofilm formation and eradication, nevertheless, the development of novel approaches for the real-time monitoring of biochemical, in particular metabolic activity, of bacterial species during the formation, life and eradication of biofilms is of great potential importance.\nHere, detection and monitoring of the metabolic activity of bacterial biofilms in high-ionic-strength solutions were enabled as a result of novel surface modification by an active redox system, composed of 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene/9,10-anthraquinone, on the oxide layer of the SiNW, yielding a chemically-gated FET array.

{"title": "Non-invasive venous waveform analysis (NIVA) for volume assessment in patients undergoing hemodialysis: an observational study.", "abstract": "Accurate assessment of volume status to direct dialysis remains a clinical challenge. Despite current attempts at volume-directed dialysis, inadequate dialysis and intradialytic hypotension (IDH) are common occurrences. Peripheral venous waveform analysis has recently been developed as a method to accurately determine intravascular volume status through algorithmic quantification of changes in the waveform that occur at different volume states. A noninvasive method to capture peripheral venous signals is described (Non-Invasive Venous waveform Analysis, NIVA). The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to characterize changes in NIVA signal with dialysis. We hypothesized that there would be a change in signal after dialysis and that the rate of intradialytic change in signal would be predictive of IDH.\nFifty subjects undergoing inpatient hemodialysis were enrolled. A 10-mm piezoelectric sensor was secured to the middle volar aspect of the wrist on the extremity opposite to the access site. Signals were obtained fifteen minutes before, throughout, and up to fifteen minutes after hemodialysis. Waveforms were analyzed after a fast Fourier transformation and identification of the frequencies corresponding to the cardiac rate, with a NIVA value generated based on the weighted powers of these frequencies.\nAdequate quality (signal to noise ratio\u2009>\u200920) signals pre- and post- dialysis were obtained in 38 patients (76%). NIVA values were significantly lower at the end of dialysis compared to pre-dialysis levels (1.203 vs 0.868, p\u2009<\u20090.05, n\u2009=\u200938). Only 16 patients had adequate signals for analysis throughout dialysis, but in this small cohort the rate of change in NIVA value was predictive of IDH with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100%.\nThis observational, proof-of-concept study using a NIVA prototype device suggests that NIVA represents a novel and non-invasive technique that with further development and improvements in signal quality may provide static and continuous measures of volume status to assist with volume directed dialysis and prevent intradialytic hypotension.", "journal": "BMC nephrology", "date": "2020-05-26", "authors": ["Bret DAlvis", "MonicaPolcz", "MerrickMiles", "DonaldWright", "MohammadShwetar", "PhilLeisy", "RachelForbes", "RachelFissell", "JonWhitfield", "SusanEagle", "ColleenBrophy", "KyleHocking"], "doi": "10.1186/s12882-020-01845-2\n10.1046/j.1525-1594.2003.07205.x\n10.1111/sdi.12627\n10.1681/ASN.2010101119\n10.1155/2018/8276912\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00812.x\n10.1093/ndt/gfg450\n10.1007/s10439-015-1313-8\n10.1097/ACO.0b013e328332a343\n10.1093/bja/aex271\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000615\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.05.003\n10.1007/s00134-015-3787-0\n10.1016/j.jclinane.2019.109664\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2019.09.009\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000615\n10.1152/jappl.1993.74.2.499\n10.1161/01.RES.8.5.1059\n10.1253/jcj.53.245\n10.1161/01.HYP.34.4.808\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000615\n10.1093/ndt/gfn501\n10.2215/CJN.03170707\n10.1109/RBME.2012.2210036\n10.1111/j.1525-139X.2012.01063.x\n10.3389/fsurg.2017.00006"}

{"title": "Bidirectional Linear Motion by Travelling Waves on Legged Piezoelectric Microfabricated Plates.", "abstract": "This paper reports the design, fabrication and performance of MEMS-based piezoelectric bidirectional conveyors featuring 3D printed legs, driven by linear travelling waves (TW). The structures consisted of an aluminium-nitride (AlN) piezoelectric film on top of millimetre-sized rectangular thin silicon bridges and two electrode patches. The position and size of the patches were analytically optimised for TW generation in three frequency ranges: 19, 112 and 420 kHz, by the proper combination of two contiguous flexural modes. After fabrication, the generated TW were characterized by means of Laser-Doppler vibrometry to obtain the relevant tables of merit, such as the standing wave ratio and the average amplitude. The experimental results agreed with the simulation, showing the generation of a TW with an amplitude as high as 6 nm/V and a standing wave ratio as low as 1.46 for a device working at 19.3 kHz. The applicability of the fabricated linear actuator device as a conveyor was investigated. Its kinetic performance was studied with sliders of different mass, being able to carry a 35 mg silicon slider, 18 times its weight, with 6 V of continuous sinusoidal excitation and a speed of 0.65 mm/s. A lighter slider, weighting only 3 mg, reached a mean speed of 1.7 mm/s at 6 V. In addition, by applying a burst sinusoidal excitation comprising 10 cycles, the TW generated in the bridge surface was able to move a 23 mg slider in discrete steps of 70 nm, in both directions, which is a promising result for a TW piezoelectric actuator of this size.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-05-24", "authors": ["V\u00edctorRuiz-D\u00edez", "JorgeHernando-Garc\u00eda", "JavierToledo", "AbdallahAbabneh", "HelmutSeidel", "Jos\u00e9 LuisS\u00e1nchez-Rojas"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11050517\n10.1108/SR-05-2013-678\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.08.003\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.07.086\n10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2040139\n10.1088/0964-1726/7/3/002\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.04.001\n10.1016/0022-460X(92)90643-C\n10.1121/1.394038\n10.1109/58.726435\n10.1088/0964-1726/6/5/014\n10.1063/1.4790278\n10.1016/j.matcom.2010.05.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/2/025013\n10.1109/TMECH.2018.2791508\n10.3390/mi11030321\n10.1177/1045389X16679284\n10.1557/mrs.2012.269\n10.1016/S0041-624X(99)00087-6\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00258-7\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2011.04.005\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.12.029\n10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2317778\n10.1088/1361-6439/aaa218\n10.3390/mi10050283\n10.1016/j.mseb.2010.05.026\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2039697\n10.1063/1.1600519\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/10/105026\n10.1007/s00542-013-2003-9\n10.1115/1.2892008\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/7/074003\n10.1007/s00542-012-1428-x\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1197960"}

Piezo-surgical corticotomy led to a decrease in bone density, which was measured on the Hounsfield scale. As a result of orthodontic treatment in patients who underwent laser corticotomy an expansion of the upper jaw and normalization of occlusion in the transversal and sagittal directions was achieved: in the region of the hard palate by 7.1\u00b10.4 mm; in the region of the alveolar bone by 6.5\u00b10.5 mm; in the region of the roots of molars by 6.4\u00b10.9 mm; in the area of crowns of molars by 8.3\u00b10.7 mm. It was found that the combined use of piezo-surgical corticotomy and orthodontic miniscrews improve the efficiency and reduce the duration of orthodontic treatment by 3 to 6 months.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u2014 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0438

{"title": "Reduced expression of carbonic anhydrase III in skeletal muscles could be linked to muscle fatigue: A rat muscle fatigue model.", "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) is expressed abundantly in slow skeletal muscles, adipocytes, and the liver. It plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular pH, antioxidation, and energy metabolism, which are further involved in fatigue. However, its function and mechanism in maintaining the physiological function of muscles or antifatigue are still ambiguous. We hypothesized that changes of CAIII in skeletal muscles might be related to the occurrence of muscle fatigue.\nAfter establishing a rat soleus muscle fatigue model, we measured the protein expression of the CAIII in muscles. And the muscle intracellular biochemical indices [malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and lactic acid] were also measured using assay kits. After transfected by CAIII-overexpressing and knockdown lentiviral vectors, the rat soleus muscles were induced to fatigue to investigate the effects and possible molecular mechanisms of CAIII in antifatigue.\nThe expression of CAIII in fatigued soleus muscles was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). Moreover, the ATP level in the fatigued muscle also significantly decreased, whereas lactic acid and MDA levels were significantly increased (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). After posttransfection for 21 days, CAIII levels in muscles were significantly reduced in the CAIII-interfering lentivirus group, but increased in the CAIII-overexpressed lentivirus group (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). In addition, CAIII knockdown muscles showed more reduction of the maximal muscle force and ATP levels\u00a0\u200band more increase of MDA and lactic acid levels during the fatigue test than the control group, (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05). On the other hand, CAIII-overexpressed muscles showed less reduction of the maximal muscle force and ATP levels and less increase of MDA and lactic acid levels during muscle fatigue than the control group (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05).\nOur study showed that soleus muscle fatigue induced by electrical stimulation could result in downregulation of CAIII and ATP levels\u00a0\u200band accumulation of lactic acid and MDA. Further study showed that CAIII knockdown led to more reduction of the maximal muscle force, whereas CAIII overexpression showed less reduction of the maximal muscle force, which suggested that CAIII levels in muscles might be related to the occurrence of muscle fatigue.\nCAIII plays an important role in muscle fatigue. Up-regulating the expression of CAIII might contribute to dissipating fatigue, which would provide a new method to solve the difficulties in eliminating muscular fatigue.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic translation", "date": "2020-05-23", "authors": ["Atik BShaikh", "HongweiFang", "MinLi", "ShiyiChen", "PengShang", "XiliangShang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jot.2019.08.008"}

Flexible pressure sensors often apply a microstructured or porous active material to improve their sensitivity and response speed. However, the microstructures or small pores will result in high haze and low transparency of the device, and thus it is challenging to balance the sensitivity and transparency simultaneously in flexible pressure sensors or electronic skins. Here, for a capacitive-type sensor that consists of a porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sandwiched between two transparent electrodes, the challenge is addressed by filling the pores with ionic liquid that has the same refractive index with PVDF, and the transmittance of the film dramatically boosts from 0 to 94.8% in the visible range. Apart from optical matching, the ionic liquid also significantly improves the signal intensity as well as the sensitivity due to the formation of an electric double layer at the dielectric-electrode interfaces, and improves the toughness and stretchability of the active material benefiting from a plasticization effect.

{"title": "Tuning Charge Transport in PVDF-Based Organic Ferroelectric Transistors: Status and Outlook.", "abstract": "The use of polymer ferroelectric dielectrics in organic field-effect transistors (FETs) for nonvolatile memory application was demonstrated more than 15 years ago. The ferroelectric dielectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymers are most widely used for such applications. In addition to memory applications, polymer ferroelectrics as a dielectric layer in organic FETs yield insights into interfacial transport properties. Advantages of polymer ferroelectric dielectrics are their high dielectric constant compared to other polymer dielectrics and their tunable dielectric constant with temperature. Further, the polarization strength may also be tuned by externally poling the ferroelectric dielectric layer. Thus, PVDF and its copolymers provide a unique testbed not just for investigating polarization induced transport in organic FETs, but also enhancing device performance. This article discusses recent developments of PVDF-based ferroelectric organic FETs and capacitors with a focus on tuning transport properties. It is shown that FET carrier mobilities exhibit a weak temperature dependence as long as the dielectric is in the ferroelectric phase, which is attributed to a polarization fluctuation driven process. The low carrier mobilities in PVDF-based FETs can be enhanced by tuning the poling condition of the dielectric. In particular, by using solution-processed small molecule semiconductors and other donor-acceptor copolymers, it is shown that selective poling of the PVDF-based dielectric layer dramatically improves FET properties. Finally, the prospects of further improvement in organic ferroelectric FETs and their challenges are provided.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-05-22", "authors": ["AmritLaudari", "JohnBarron", "AlecPickett", "SuchismitaGuha"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c05731"}

They were thereafter used as absorption membranes separating two compartments mimicking the luminal and serosal side of the intestine in vitro. Membranes were subjected to dispersions of an LBF that had been digested by porcine pancreatin and spiked with the membrane integrity marker Lucifer Yellow (LY). Three fenofibrate-loaded LBFs were used to explore the in vivo relevance of the assay.\nOf the explored artificial membranes, only LiDo applied to PVDF was compatible with lipolysis by porcine pancreatin. Formulation ranking based on mass transfer in the LiDo model exposed was the same as drug release in single-compartment lipolysis. Ranking based on observed apparent permeability coefficients of fenofibrate with different LBFs were the same as those obtained in a cell-based model.\nThe LiDo membrane was able to withstand lipolysis for a sufficient assay period.

{"title": "Postmortem Analysis Using Different Sensors and Technologies on Aramid Composites Samples after Ballistic Impact.", "abstract": "This work focuses on the combination of two complementary non-destructive techniques to analyse the final deformation and internal damage induced in aramid composite plates subjected to ballistic impact. The first analysis device, a 3D scanner, allows digitalising the surface of the tested specimen. Comparing with the initial geometry, the permanent residual deformation (PBFD) can be obtained according to the impact characteristics. This is a significant parameter in armours and shielding design. The second inspection technique is based on computed tomography (CT). It allows analysing the internal state of the impacted sample, being able to detect possible delamination and fibre failure through the specimen thickness. The proposed methodology has been validated with two projectile geometries at different impact velocities, being the reaction force history on the specimen determined with piezoelectric sensors. Different loading states and induced damages were observed according to the projectile type and impact velocity. In order to validate the use of the 3D scanner, a correlation between impact velocity and damage induced in terms of permanent back face deformation has been realised for both projectiles studied. In addition, a comparison of the results obtained through this measurement method and those obtained in similar works, has been performed in the same range of impact energy. The results showed that CT is needed to analyse the internal damage of the aramid sample; however, this is a highly expensive and time-consuming method. The use of 3D scanner and piezoelectric sensors is perfectly complementary with CT and could be relevant to develop numerical models or design armours.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-21", "authors": ["IgnacioRubio", "AntonioD\u00edaz-\u00c1lvarez", "RichardBernier", "AlexisRusinek", "Jose AntonioLoya", "Maria HenarMiguelez", "MarcosRodr\u00edguez-Mill\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.3390/s20102853\n10.1016/j.dt.2019.02.002\n10.1177/1056789518795203\n10.14429/dsj.62.1467\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.08.027\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.01.006\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.03.068\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.08.035\n10.3390/polym11091395\n10.1080/13588265.2018.1511234\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2012.07.005\n10.3390/app9030516\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2005.05.014\n10.1177/0731684414562223\n10.1016/0020-7683(92)90207-A\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.06.092\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2007.03.008\n10.1007/BF00570886\n10.3390/app10010288\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2012.06.003\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2017.10.010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111153\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.05.068\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.12.081\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.08.015\n10.1177/0731684415608004\n10.1016/j.matpr.2017.12.202\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2016.01.006\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.09.019\n10.1007/s11340-013-9829-z\n10.1016/j.tws.2017.11.004\n10.3390/polym11020198"}

Air velocity, pressure, temperature, turbulent kinetic energy and density contours were generated and analysed in order to achieve an optimal attenuation force for fibre production. A bespoke convergent nozzle was used to produce polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibres at air pressures between 1 and 5 bar. The nozzle comprised of four parts: a polymer solution syringe holder, an air inlet, an air chamber, and a cap that covers the air chamber. A custom-built SBS setup was used to produce PVDF submicron fibres which were consequently analysed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) for their morphological features. Both theoretical and experimental observations showed that a higher air pressure (4 bar) is more suitable to achieve thin fibres of PVDF.

{"title": "Static Tactile Sensing for a Robotic Electronic Skin via an Electromechanical Impedance-Based Approach.", "abstract": "Tactile sensing is paramount for robots operating in human-centered environments to help in understanding interaction with objects. To enable robots to have sophisticated tactile sensing capability, researchers have developed different kinds of electronic skins for robotic hands and arms in order to realize the 'sense of touch'. Recently, Stanford Structures and Composites Laboratory developed a robotic electronic skin based on a network of multi-modal micro-sensors. This skin was able to identify temperature profiles and detect arm strikes through embedded sensors. However, sensing for the static pressure load is yet to be investigated. In this work, an electromechanical impedance-based method is proposed to investigate the response of piezoelectric sensors under static normal pressure loads. The smart skin sample was firstly fabricated by embedding a piezoelectric sensor into the soft silicone. Then, a series of static pressure tests to the skin were conducted. Test results showed that the first peak of the real part impedance signal was sensitive to static pressure load, and by using the proposed diagnostic method, this test setup could detect a resolution of 0.5 N force. Numerical simulation methods were then performed to validate the experimental results. The results of the numerical simulation prove the validity of the experiments, as well as the robustness of the proposed method in detecting static pressure loads using the smart skin.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-21", "authors": ["ChengLiu", "YitaoZhuang", "AmirNasrollahi", "LinglingLu", "Mohammad FaisalHaider", "Fu-KuoChang"], "doi": "10.3390/s20102830\n10.1177/027836498400300402\n10.1109/TRO.2009.2033627\n10.1177/027836490001900702\n10.1163/156855394X00356\n10.3390/s18103260\n10.3390/s140305296\n10.3390/s17112653\n10.3390/s18040948\n10.1109/LRA.2018.2851757\n10.1155/2015/846487\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103907\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa63da\n10.1097/01.ASW.0000460127.47415.6e\n10.1177/1475921717732331\n10.1121/1.1903422\n10.1089/soro.2014.0016\n10.1115/1.1584492\n10.1177/1045389X9700800406\n10.1109/58.808876"}

In addition, several strategies to improve the performance of piezoelectric sensors are summed up: (1) material innovation: from piezoelectric semiconductor materials, inorganic piezoceramic materials, organic piezoelectric polymer, nanocomposite materials, to emerging and promising molecular ferroelectric materials. (2) designing microstructures on the surface of the piezoelectric materials to enlarge the contact area of piezoelectric materials under the applied force. (3) addition of dopants such as chemical elements and graphene in conventional piezoelectric materials. (4) developing piezoelectric transistors based on piezotronic effect. In addition, the principle, advantages, disadvantages and challenges of every strategy are discussed. Apart from that, the prospects and directions of piezoelectric sensors are predicted. In the future, the electronic sensors need to be embedded in the microelectronic systems to play the full part. Therefore, a strategy based on peripheral circuits to improve the performance of piezoelectric sensors is proposed in the final part of this review.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-21", "authors": ["ShengshunDuan", "JunWu", "JunXia", "WeiLei"], "doi": "10.3390/s20102820\n10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2435000\n10.1088/1742-6596/1140/1/012006\n10.1039/c1jm14491j\n10.1002/admt.201700222\n10.1002/adma.201500009\n10.1002/adfm.201504755\n10.1021/nn402728g\n10.1021/acsnano.7b04898\n10.1002/adma.201505118\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.053\n10.3390/s100301935\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.059\n10.1039/c0ee00137f\n10.1002/anie.201201656\n10.1002/adma.201802084\n10.1108/sr.2002.22.4.363.2\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.072\n10.1002/adem.201700760\n10.1088/1361-6528/aaeddd\n10.1021/nl061802g\n10.1021/acsnano.5b04526\n10.1039/C6NR04057H\n10.1002/adma.200601908\n10.1002/adma.201504299\n10.1177/0040517515578333\n10.1177/0142331216672918\n10.3390/s18010078\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.012\n10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2008559\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2701835\n10.1007/s12206-017-0804-y\n10.1007/s11277-017-5194-z\n10.3390/s8010271\n10.1088/1361-665X/aadc8d\n10.1007/s00170-013-5410-2\n10.1177/1045389X12443597\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/6/065004\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.06.011\n10.1115/1.4006366\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/085016\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055017\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/4/045038\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/48/485502\n10.1039/C4TC01307G\n10.1109/TMAG.2009.2029635\n10.1007/s00542-009-0797-2\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.04.008\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2735858\n10.1021/nn406481k\n10.1002/adma.201200105\n10.1039/c2ee23718k\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.049\n10.1038/srep10728\n10.1016/j.nantod.2010.10.008\n10.1007/s00542-015-2801-3\n10.1002/smll.201604245\n10.1021/am504903b\n10.1080/00150193.2015.997146\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2014.06.001\n10.3390/act5010005\n10.1039/C8TC04515A\n10.1021/acsami.7b03929\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2050585\n10.1007/s10853-009-3643-0\n10.1121/1.1908324\n10.1088/0957-4484/25/37/375603\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.02.001\n10.1063/1.1784039\n10.3390/s18020330\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1232582\n10.1038/s41598-017-13281-8\n10.1088/0957-4484/27/9/095401\n10.1186/s11671-018-2492-7\n10.1002/polb.1991.090291012\n10.1002/app.34431\n10.1007/s13391-013-3083-5\n10.1016/S0304-3886(01)00042-0\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.853.79\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.053\n10.1039/C5NR08618C\n10.1002/marc.200700544\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.08.019\n10.1016/0025-5408(78)90161-7\n10.1002/adfm.201801724\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.05.025\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.12.003\n10.1007/s10853-010-4940-3\n10.1002/adma.201103406\n10.1039/C4EE02358G\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b00117\n10.1021/acsami.7b00380\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.027\n10.3390/s18113789\n10.1021/acsami.8b19824\n10.1177/0021998317704709\n10.1038/ncomms14551\n10.1126/science.aav3057\n10.1126/science.aas9330\n10.1021/jacs.8b04600\n10.1021/jacs.7b10449\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053002\n10.1039/C8NR05292A\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.071\n10.1039/C5TC02173A\n10.1126/sciadv.1500661\n10.1038/ncomms2639\n10.1002/adfm.201500856\n10.1039/C2EE23404A\n10.1002/polb.24144\n10.1021/acsami.5b11356\n10.1002/adma.201705778\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.013\n10.1021/acsami.8b10552\n10.1021/acsami.5b10345\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b00069\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.02.059\n10.1063/1.2830663\n10.1063/1.2903152\n10.1103/PhysRevB.82.014116\n10.1007/s11431-011-4682-8\n10.1039/c3nr03402j\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.079\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.07.035\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.02.119\n10.1039/C5NR07185B\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.07.329\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.08.278\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2017.08.067\n10.1016/j.physe.2017.04.010\n10.1039/C6RA26285F\n10.1063/1.4812472\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa6d4b\n10.1007/s10854-018-0237-0\n10.1039/c3cp55238a\n10.1002/aenm.201601016\n10.1039/C4RA02040E\n10.1021/acsnano.8b01805\n10.1088/1361-6463/aadb15\n10.1002/adma.200602918\n10.1093/nsr/nwt002\n10.1016/j.nantod.2013.11.002\n10.1021/nl802367t\n10.1021/nl1014298\n10.1002/adfm.201001058\n10.1039/c2jm31434g\n10.1126/science.1230969\n10.1039/C4NR05597G\n10.1143/APEX.5.061101\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.088\n10.1021/am5070443\n10.1002/adma.201500582\n10.1002/adma.201702308"}

In this study, we investigate the effect of solid content on the rheological properties of and the microstructures in the cathode slurry prepared from Ni-rich materials. With long-chain structures, PVDF molecules can change their configurations when they come into contact with the solid particles in slurries, and their bridging function can change with the solid content in the slurry. Below the optimum content, particle sedimentation easily takes place. Above the optimum content, excessive yield stress is created in the slurry, and this stress is not conducive to homogeneous distribution of the components. The rheological properties of the slurries vary greatly under different solid contents. We investigated the uniformity and stability of the slurry prepared from Ni-rich materials and found that the most suitable solid content of the slurry lies in the range from 63.9% to 66.3%.

However, for many of these applications, the SAW devices will inevitably be used in acid or alkali harsh environments, which may cause their early failures. In this work, we investigated the behavior and degradation mechanisms of thin film based SAW devices in acid and alkali harsh environments. Results show that under the acid and alkali attacks, chemical reaction and corrosion of ZnO devices are very fast (usually within 45 s). During the corrosion, the crystalline orientation of the ZnO film is not changed, but its grain defects are significantly increased and the grain sizes are decreased. The velocity of ZnO-based SAW devices is decreased due to the formation of porous structures induced by the chemical reactions. Whereas an AlN thin-film based SAW device does not perform well in acid-alkali conditions, it might be able to maintain a normal performance without obvious degradation for more than ten hours in acid or alkali solutions. This work could provide guidance for the applications of both ZnO or AlN-based SAW devices in acid/alkali harsh environments.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2020-05-20", "authors": ["ShuoXiong", "XudongLiu", "JianZhou", "YiLiu", "YipingShen", "XiaoboYin", "JianhuiWu", "RanTao", "YongqingFu", "HuigaoDuan"], "doi": "10.1039/d0ra02448a\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.06.075\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2014.12.002\n10.1039/C8RA09859J\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.02.317\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.126958\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.09.038\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.05.066\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/5/055014\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.122\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.011\n10.1007/s10404-014-1456-1\n10.1016/j.spmi.2007.04.081\n10.1021/acsami.6b16261\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.01.050\n10.1039/B211723C\n10.1002/pssa.201431747\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.02.042\n10.1016/0925-4005(94)01313-6\n10.1016/S1466-6049(99)00034-3\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2000.tb01145.x"}

Patient-derived tumor organoids were dissociated into single cell suspension and used as a bioink. The individual cells were precisely allocated into a microwell plate by drop-on-demand inkjet printing without any additive or treatment, followed by culturing into organoids for further analysis. The sizes and morphologies of the organoids were observed, so as the expression of proliferation and apoptotic markers. The tumor organoids also showed heterogeneous responses against chemotherapeutic agent. Further, we quantified mRNA expression levels of representative luminal and basal genes in both type of tumor organoids.

{"title": "Constructing a Microcapacitor Network of Carbon Nanotubes in Polymer Blends via Crystallization-Induced Phase Separation Toward High Dielectric Constant and Low Loss.", "abstract": "Tailoring the distribution of nanoparticles and further constructing effective microcapacitors in polymer blends are important issues for developing high-performance polymer dielectric nanocomposites. The common method to control the selective localization of nanoparticles in an immiscible polymer blend is relatively difficult and it easily results in the accumulation of nanoparticles in one component, which usually leads to a dramatic increase of the dielectric loss in the nanocomposites. In this work, a novel strategy based on step-by-step crystallization has been proposed to tailor the refined distribution and dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a melt-miscible blend poly(butylene succinate)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PBS/PVDF) through the crystallization-induced phase separation and the engineered interfacial affinity between CNTs and polymer components to acquire high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. The results reveal that PBS is excluded along the growth front of PVDF spherulites and locates in the margin areas of PVDF spherulites during the step-by-step crystallization process. Moreover, because of the higher interfacial interaction between CNTs and PBS, CNTs are located in the PBS-rich domain, resulting in a high concentration of CNTs in the interspherulites of PVDF. Thus, the dielectric constants of the nanocomposites are greatly improved by nearly 5-24 times compared with the nanocomposites achieved by quick cooling and, simultaneously, the dielectric loss of the nanocomposites is still maintained at a low level. This work shows that the step-by-step crystallization method can be used to fabricate the nanocomposites with a synergistic increase in the dielectric performance due to the formation of a refined microcapacitor assembly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that the dielectric constant of the nanocomposites can be greatly enhanced just through the crystallization-optimized distribution and dispersion of CNTs in immiscible polymer blends, and it possibly gives a new technical route for the fabrication of advanced dielectric composites.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-05-20", "authors": ["Han-JunMao", "Dan-FengLiu", "NanZhang", "TingHuang", "InesK\u00fchnert", "Jing-HuiYang", "YongWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c04575"}

{"title": "Synthesis, Characterization and Development of Energy Harvesting Techniques Incorporated with Antennas: A Review Study.", "abstract": "The investigation into new sources of energy with the highest efficiency which are derived from existing energy sources is a significant research area and is attracting a great deal of interest. Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising alternative for obtaining energy for wireless devices directly from RF energy sources in the environment. An overview of the energy harvesting concept will be discussed in detail in this paper. Energy harvesting is a very promising method for the development of self-powered electronics. Many applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart environments, the military or agricultural monitoring depend on the use of sensor networks which require a large variety of small and scattered devices. The low-power operation of such distributed devices requires wireless energy to be obtained from their surroundings in order to achieve safe, self-sufficient and maintenance-free systems. The energy harvesting circuit is known to be an interface between piezoelectric and electro-strictive loads. A modern view of circuitry for energy harvesting is based on power conditioning principles that also involve AC-to-DC conversion and voltage regulation. Throughout the field of energy conversion, energy harvesting circuits often impose electric boundaries for devices, which are important for maximizing the energy that is harvested. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is described as the ratio between the rectifier's output DC power and the antenna-based RF-input power (before its passage through the corresponding network).", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-05-18", "authors": ["Husam HamidIbrahim", "Mandeep S JSingh", "Samir SalemAl-Bawri", "Mohammad TariqulIslam"], "doi": "10.3390/s20102772\n10.1088/1361-6528/ab793e\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114902\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114191\n10.1002/mmce.21775\n10.1109/LAWP.2016.2642124\n10.1109/LAWP.2015.2427232\n10.1109/LAWP.2017.2761397\n10.1109/TAP.2012.2228617\n10.1109/TAP.2015.2389219\n10.1049/iet-map.2016.0238\n10.1109/TAP.2013.2251596\n10.1109/LAWP.2015.2403572\n10.1109/TMTT.2015.2416233\n10.1109/TAP.2016.2565697\n10.1038/nbt.3020\n10.3390/s18082446\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.010\n10.1049/iet-map.2018.5704\n10.1109/TPEL.2018.2831714\n10.1109/TAP.2018.2882632\n10.1109/LAWP.2019.2904795\n10.1109/TMTT.2019.2906598\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848907\n10.1109/JERM.2018.2817364\n10.1002/mmce.21636\n10.1002/mmce.21658\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2851187\n10.3390/electronics8050486\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.053\n10.1109/TCSI.2016.2555249\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.021\n10.1002/mmce.21633\n10.1109/TMTT.2019.2902552\n10.1109/TMTT.2017.2721399\n10.1109/LAWP.2019.2950178\n10.3390/electronics7070125\n10.1109/TCPMT.2018.2878927\n10.1109/TAP.2019.2927879\n10.1109/LAWP.2018.2866233\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.100\n10.1109/LAWP.2013.2272873\n10.1109/LMWC.2015.2451397\n10.1080/23311916.2017.1332705\n10.1109/LAWP.2019.2900301\n10.1109/TAP.2017.2754423\n10.1109/TAP.2018.2797530\n10.1109/LAWP.2016.2594081\n10.1109/TAP.2017.2784445\n10.1109/LAWP.2019.2901838\n10.1109/TAP.2018.2867036\n10.1109/LAWP.2015.2446193\n10.1109/LAWP.2018.2889645\n10.1109/LAWP.2018.2805827\n10.1016/j.egypro.2018.11.255\n10.3390/electronics8070787\n10.3390/electronics8060714\n10.1109/TAP.2016.2517673\n10.1002/mop.29942\n10.1109/MAP.2017.2686093\n10.1109/LAWP.2016.2598729\n10.1049/el.2015.1022\n10.1049/iet-map.2015.0650\n10.1177/0040517518764000\n10.1049/iet-map.2017.0008\n10.1109/TAP.2015.2510035\n10.3390/s20020457\n10.3390/s20051354\n10.1109/MAP.2012.8046161\n10.1002/mop.31588\n10.1017/S1759078719001107\n10.1109/TAP.2015.2481922\n10.1109/TMTT.2015.2446476"}
{"title": "Understanding the Potential Screening Effect through the Discretely Structured ZnO Nanorods Piezo Array.", "abstract": "The potential screening effect of one-dimensional ZnO nanorods from carriers has been theoretically proved to severely limit its piezoelectricity, but its exact mechanism needs to be further revealed in experiments to guide the design of piezoelectric semiconductors. Here, a discretely structured design was proposed to prevent the free carriers from tunneling among adjacent ZnO nanorods for suppressing the screening effect. Piezoresponse force microscope and finite element analysis were employed in combination to uncover the underlying mechanism in experiment. Further, the output voltage of this discretely structured device was 1.62 times higher than that of the nondesigned device, which clearly authenticates this suppression behavior. Besides, this design prompts an unexpected improvement in flexibility, where the flexural modulus of this piezo-film was reduced by 35.74%. Notably, this work opens a new way to understand the potential screening effect, as expected, and to advance the development of piezo-electronics toward better piezoelectricity and more excellent flexibility.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2020-05-16", "authors": ["GuoTian", "DaXiong", "YuhanSu", "TaoYang", "YuyuGao", "ChengYan", "WenDeng", "LongJin", "HaitaoZhang", "XiaoqiangFan", "ChaomingWang", "WeiliDeng", "WeiqingYang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c00793"}
{"title": "The Repetitive Mechanical Tactile Stimulus Intervention Effects Depend on Input Methods.", "abstract": "Elderly and stroke patients often have low spatial two-point discrimination function. The intervention effect of repetitive mechanical tactile stimulation has been shown to improve the spatial two-point discrimination function. The methods of tactile input are classified as either Active Touch or Passive Touch. In Passive Touch, the tactile stimulus is passively applied on the skin without voluntary movement, whereas in Active Touch, it is applied with voluntary movement. Based on the method of tactile input, tactile stimulation activate different cerebral cortex areas. A previous study reported that the tactile stimulation with Active Touch activate posterior parietal cortex, activated during a spatial two-point discrimination task. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of two mechanical tactile stimulation intervention methods on two-point discrimination: tactile stimulation with voluntary movement (Active Touch) and without voluntary movement (Passive Touch). We recruited 15 healthy volunteers aged 20-23 years and applied tactile stimuli on their right index finger for 10 min. The mechanical tactile stimulator comprised 24 tiny plastic pins driven by piezoelectric actuators. In the Active Touch intervention, the pin was rubbed by voluntary movement of the right index finger (abduction 0\u00b0-10\u00b0) after the appearance of 12 pins. The Passive Touch intervention stimulated the index finger with the 12 pins setting at the centre of index finger. Tactile thresholds were measured using a two-point discrimination measurement device. Two-point discrimination threshold showed significant reduction after Active Touch intervention compared with those pre-intervention (Pre). Two-point discrimination threshold were not significantly modulated after Passive Touch intervention; however, significant negative correlation was observed between the intervention effect on two-point discrimination threshold and the performance Pre. This study suggesting that the effects of repetitive mechanical tactile stimulation depend on the method of tactile input. An effective intervention for improving two-point discrimination threshold is the application of Active Touch condition for 10 min.", "journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "date": "2020-05-16", "authors": ["HirakuWatanabe", "ShoKojima", "NaofumiOtsuru", "HideakiOnishi"], "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2020.00393\n10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00051\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.013\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.25.112701.142922\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104721\n10.2340/16501977-0662\n10.1016/0003-9993(93)90158-7\n10.1002/ana.20862\n10.1126/science.1085423\n10.1002/mds.27470\n10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.0099\n10.1111/ejn.12293\n10.1097/00001756-200303240-00002\n10.1523/jneurosci.20-04-01597.2000\n10.1113/jphysiol.2007.140079\n10.1152/jn.1981.46.6.1177\n10.1093/cercor/bhn190\n10.1186/1471-2202-8-58\n10.2147/cia.s3174\n10.1155/2018/5383514\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2722-11.2012\n10.1016/j.jhsb.2004.02.008\n10.1002/hbm.22172\n10.1093/ageing/afh218\n10.1152/jn.1997.77.3.1132\n10.1177/1545968315624779\n10.2522/ptj.20130271\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.06.020\n10.1523/jneurosci.4835-05.2006\n10.1006/nimg.1998.0332\n10.1152/jn.00280.2018\n10.1016/j.clinph.2009.12.022\n10.1016/j.brainres.2013.08.048\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.01.005\n10.1073/pnas.191176298\n10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00677-9\n10.1038/srep27388\n10.1111/1440-1630.12170\n10.1186/1471-2202-9-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2008-15.2016\n10.1016/j.clinph.2017.03.046\n10.1038/s41598-019-53637-w\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.05.032\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1587-17.2018\n10.3389/fnhum.2013.00579\n10.1177/0269215519829795\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.11.041\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024860\n10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134525"}

Its first use dates to 1975 by Horton even if the first effective device for use in dentistry, has been developed by Vercellotti after the year 2000. The hypothesis of this study is that piezosurgery technology is more suitable in terms of specific intra-operative and postoperative evaluations compared to the rotary technology in ostectomy for the avulsion of the third molar germ. The null hypothesis presented is the lack of significant differences between the two technologies after and during surgery.\nIntraoperative and postoperative aspects are evaluated for a comparison between traditional rotary instruments and piezosurgery during germectomies in young patients through a blind randomized study (split-mouth). The surgical technique to employ for each hemi-arch was randomly selected from a computer algorithm. Different criteria were considered during the surgical procedure, in order to compare the two techniques.\nThe piezoelectric technique demanded more time than traditional rotary method, and the difference was statistically significant both for the time of the entire procedure and the time only required for the ostectomy itself. Postoperative evaluations such as maximum mouth opening, facial swelling and postoperative pain showed no statistical difference.\nEven if the adopted clinical trial did not highlight any statistical difference the following review of literature showed an encouraging reduction in postoperative discomfort given by the piezosurgery as opposed to the traditional rotary bur surgery.

{"title": "Effect of Nearby Construction Activity on Endothelial Function, Sensitivity to Nitric Oxide, and Potassium Channel Activity in the Middle Cerebral Arteries of Rats.", "abstract": "The present study assessed the effect of nearby construction activity on the responses of rat middle cerebral arteries (MCA)to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine and the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and the activity of MaxiK potassium channels in MCA smooth muscle cells from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Two monitoring systems were used to assess vibrations in the animal rooms during and immediately after construction activities near the research building where the animal facility is located. One was a commercially available system; the other was a Raspberry-Pi (RPi)-based vibration monitoring system designed in our laboratory that included a small computing unit attached to a rolling sensor (low sensitivity) and a piezoelectric film sensor (high sensitivity). Both systems recorded increased levels of vibration during construction activity outside the building. During the construction period, vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and SNP were abolished, and MaxiK single-channel current opening frequency and open-state probability in cell-attached patches of isolated MCA myocytes were dramatically decreased.

Minimizing the optical and acoustic paths for excitation and detection could significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This could be accomplished by transparent transducers permitting through-transducer illumination. However, most ultrasound transducers are not optically transparent. Capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer (CMUT) technology has compelling properties compared to piezoelectric transducers such as wide bandwidth and high receive sensitivity. Here, we introduce transparent CMUT linear arrays with high transparency in the visible and near-infrared range. To fabricate the devices, we used an adhesive wafer bonding technique using photosensitive benzocyclobutene (BCB) as both a structural and adhesive layer with a glass-indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate. Silicon nitride is used as the membrane material ensuring hermiticity and optical transparency. Our fabricated transducer arrays consist of 64 and 128 elements with immersion operation frequency of 8 MHz, enabling high-resolution imaging. ITO, along with thin metal strips, are used as a conductive layer for the top electrodes with minimal impact on device transparency. Fabricated devices have shown average transparency of 70% in the visible wavelength range that goes up to 90% in the near-infrared range.

The aim of this prospective observational study was to introduce a two-stage mental foramen distalization technique to minimize the complications associated with IAN transpositioning. Ten patients with severely atrophied mandibular ridges were included. Cone beam computed tomography was ordered to accurately locate the position of the IAN and its incisive terminal branch before designing the outline of two cortical osteotomies anterior and posterior to the mental foramen. The osteotomies were created using a piezoelectric device, followed by separation and identification of the nerve. The incisive branch was severed to freely transpose the IAN. A new foramen was created far distally and the cortical windows were repositioned and fixed with two screws. Healing was uneventful for all patients. Neurosensory recovery was assessed by MRC scale. All cases showed full recovery within 6 weeks, except for two patients who showed complete recovery after 16 weeks. Four months postoperative, all patients showed complete consolidation of the cortical windows without any signs of failure implants were placed at the pre-planned surgical sites.

In this work, antimony (Sb) doping is proposed as a powerful approach for enhancing the photo- and piezocatalytic performances of piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films. To investigate the role played by the dopant, the degradation of Rhodamine-\u03b2 (Rh-\u03b2), a dye pollutant widely present in natural water sources, is studied when the catalyst is irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light or ultrasound (US) waves. Depending on the doping level, the structural, optical, and ferroelectric properties of the catalyst can be properly set to maximize the dye degradation efficiency. Independently of the irradiation source, the fastest and complete dye degradation is observed in the presence of the doped catalyst and for an optimal amount of the inserted dopant. Among ZnO:Sb samples, the most doped one (5 at. %) shows improved UV light absorption and photocatalytic properties. Conversely, the piezocatalytic efficiency is maximized using the lowest Sb amount (1 at. %).

Results indicate that the HR-PMUT array has a lower crosstalk effect than the traditional C-PMUT array. Furthermore, the highest ultrasonic output pressure of HR-PMUT array at the resonant frequency can be achieved with an increase of up to 163% compared with that of the C-PMUT array because of the liquid amplification effect.

The hysteresis model of piezo scanner displacement is complex and difficult to correct, which is the main reason why the output displacement of the piezo scanner does not have high precision. In this study, an image pixel hysteresis model of the piezo scanner displacement in the AFM system was established. An AFM was used to scan a two-dimensional (2D) grating in the 0\u00a0\u00b0 and 90\u00a0\u00b0 directions and a polynomial fitting method was employed to obtain the image pixel hysteresis model parameters of the piezo scanner displacement in the X-direction and Y-direction. The image pixel hysteresis model was applied to correct the AFM scan image of regular octagons. The results showed that the relative measurement error in the X-direction was decreased from 12.47% to 0.52% after the correction and that in the Y-direction decreased from 28.57% to 0.35%. The image pixel hysteresis model can be applied in the post-processing software of a commercial AFM system. The model solves the hysteresis problem of the AFM system and improves the measuring accuracy of AFM in 2 degrees of freedom (2 DOF).", "journal": "Ultramicroscopy", "date": "2020-05-11", "authors": ["BaishunSun", "LiangCao", "ZhengchengLu", "ChenchenXie", "ZhengxunSong", "ZhankunWeng", "ZuobinWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.112992"}

Here, a material combination concept is proposed to construct 4D printed devices whose property and functionality can controllably vary. The 4D printed devices consist of conductive and magnetic parts, enabling the integrated devices to show a piezoelectric property even neither part is piezoelectric individually. Consequently, the functionality of the devices is endowed to transfer mechanical to electrical energy based on the electromagnetic introduction principle. The working mechanism of 4D printed devices is explained by a numerical simulation method using Comsol software, facilitating further optimization of their properties by regulating diverse parameters. Due to the self-powered, quick-responding, and sensitive properties, the 4D printed magnetoelectric device could work as pressure sensors to warn illegal invasion.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Visual skin assessment and sub-epidermal moisture assessments were undertaken daily. Activity was measured using the Braden subscale. Further, a mobility profile of the participants was identified using a piezoelectric motion sensor which provided a \"movement score\" (mean number of movements/hour). Movement scores from 22 healthy participants were also measured to better understand the mobility profile in a healthy population.\nPressure ulcer incidence using visual skin assessment was 12.7% (low movers\u00a0=\u00a06.7%; high movers\u00a0=\u00a06%) and 78.7% using sub-epidermal moisture assessment (low movers\u00a0=\u00a040.0%; high movers\u00a0=\u00a038.7%). Sub-epidermal moisture assessment detected pressure ulcers on average 8.2\u00a0days before they appeared visually on the skin's surface. Pressure ulcer detection was 25 times greater using sub-epidermal moisture compared to visual skin assessment. Considering the results of the \"movement level\" assessment using the motion sensor technology, of all those who were determined to be immobile by Braden, 18.8% were assessed as high movers.\nPressure ulcers occurred both in low and high movers, which was unexpected as a similar finding has not been previously reported in the literature.\nThe traditional focus on low movers/immobile individuals may detract from the identification of those making an abnormally high frequency of unsafe movements.

Office, ambulatory and home hypertension was diagnosed in 29.5, 27.1 and 26.3% of participants. The agreement of OBP with ABP was 74.5% (kappa 0.37) and HBP 76.1% (kappa 0.41), with closer agreement between HBP and ABP (84.9%, kappa 0.61). LVMI gave comparable correlations with systolic OBP, 24-h ABP and HBP (r = 0.31/0.31/0.30, all P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The same was the case for IMT (0.33/0.32/0.37, all P\u200a<\u200a0.01) and piezo-electronic PWV (0.55/0.53/0.52, all P\u200a<\u200a0.01), whereas oscillometric PWV gave stronger correlations with OBP than ABP or HBP. In linear regression analysis, the variation of LVMI was determined by night-time ABP, of IMT by HBP and of PWV by OBP and 24-h ABP.\nThese data suggest that in young individuals, target organ damage is mainly determined by out-of-office rather than office BP.

In this paper, a simplified interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy system is proposed for hysteresis modelling and feedforward control of a piezoelectric actuator. The partial derivative of the output of IT2 fuzzy system with respect to the modelling parameters can be analytically computed with the antecedent part of IT2 fuzzy rule specifically designed. In the experiments, gradient based optimization was used to identify the IT2 fuzzy hysteresis model. Results showed that the maximum error of model identification is 0.42% with only 3 developed IT2 fuzzy rules. Moreover, the model validation was conducted to demonstrate the generalization performance of the identified model. Based on the analytic inverse of the developed model, feedforward control experiment for tracking sinusoidal trajectory of 20 Hz was carried out. As a result, the hysteresis effect of the piezoelectric actuator was reduced with the maximum tracking error being 4.6%.

In this paper, a dynamic monitorization through a set of 5 accelerometers is tested to analyze the interactions between the tool-workpiece-machine mechanical assembly. A UVABB tool attached to a milling machine and equipped with a piezoelectric stack that is able to assist the process with a 40-kHz vibration is tested on a milled C45 steel surface. First, the natural frequencies of the mechanical system are obtained through hammer impact tests. Then, the vibratory signals transmitted during the execution of the process are monitored and compared to those: two feed velocities and two burnishing preloads, all with and without vibration-assistance. Results show that the proposed accelerometer set is valid to assess the behavior of a UVABB process. The system's natural frequencies are not varied by vibration-assistance and are not excited when the piezoelectric is functioning.

The described sensor network was designed as an island-and-serpentine type network comprising a grid of sensor \"islands\" connected by interconnecting \"serpentines.\" A novel high-yield manufacturing process was developed to fabricate networks on recyclable 4-inch wafers at a low cost. The resulting stretched sensor network has 17 distributed and functionalized sensing nodes with low tolerance and high resolution. The sensor network includes Piezoelectric (PZT), Strain Gauge (SG), and Resistive Temperature Detector (RTD) sensors. The design and development of a flexible frame with signal conditioning, data acquisition, and wireless data transmission electronics for the stretchable sensor network are also presented. The primary purpose of the frame subsystem is to convert sensor signals into meaningful data, which are displayed in real-time for an end-user to view and analyze. The challenges and demonstrated successes in developing this new system are demonstrated, including (a) developing separate signal conditioning circuitry and components for all three sensor types (b) enabling simultaneous sampling for PZT sensors for impact detection and (c) configuration of firmware/software for correct system operation.

Piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) probes are placed at different radial wall positions at the stationary specimen opposite of the oscillation horn and yield a declining flow aggressiveness with increasing radial position and gap width. The measurement results are reproduced by virtual probes in CFD simulations. Pressure measurement results yield a measure of flow aggressiveness in terms of wall load collectives that correlate well with incubation times obtained by erosion tests. A maximum aggressiveness at the specimen at 0.5mm gap width is obtained. Subharmonic frequencies associated with horn-attached void cavities increase with gap width which is well captured by the simulation. Due to the revealing of 3D flow patterns by the validated CFD results, detailed flow mechanisms associated with flow aggressiveness are discussed. The subharmonic frequency characteristics vs. gap width is associated with the shielding of the inner attached cavity region for small gaps and prevents the cavity from subharmonic collapse for several horn cycles. This shielding is less pronounced for larger gaps and leads to a shorter life time of the attached cavity and therefore to higher subharmonic frequencies.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2020-05-04", "authors": ["FelixSchreiner", "SimonPaepenm\u00f6ller", "RomualdSkoda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105091"}

The core of the INS integrates accelerometers and gyroscopes used to measure forces and angular rate in the vehicular inertial reference frame. With the help of gyroscopes and by integrating the acceleration to compute velocity and distance, precision and compact accelerometers with sufficient accuracy can provide small-error location determination. Solid-state implementations, through coherent readout, can provide a platform for high performance acceleration detection. In contrast to prior accelerometers using piezoelectric or capacitive readout techniques, optical readout provides narrow-linewidth high-sensitivity laser detection along with low-noise resonant optomechanical transduction near the thermodynamical limits.

The use of quantum and photon confinement has enabled a true revolution in the development of high-performance devices.

{"title": "Multifunctional Pacemaker Lead for Cardiac Energy Harvesting and Pressure Sensing.", "abstract": "Biomedical self-sustainable energy generation represents a new frontier of power solution for implantable biomedical devices (IMDs), such as cardiac pacemakers. However, almost all reported cardiac energy harvesting designs have not yet reached the stage of clinical translation. A major bottleneck has been the need of additional surgeries for the placements of these devices. Here, integrated piezoelectric-based energy harvesting and sensing designs are reported, which can be seamlessly incorporated into existing IMDs for ease of clinical translation. In vitro experiments validate the energy harvesting process by simulating the bending and twisting motion during heart cycle. Clinical translation is demonstrated in four porcine hearts in vivo under various conditions. Energy harvesting strategy utilizes pacemaker leads as a means of reducing the reliance on batteries and demonstrates the charging ability for extending the lifetime of a pacemaker battery by 20%, which provides a promising self-sustainable energy solution for IMDs. The additional self-powered blood pressure sensing is discussed, and the reported results demonstrate the potential in alerting arrhythmias by monitoring the right ventricular pressure variations.

{"title": "Direct Fabrication of Freestanding and Patterned Nanoporous Junctions in a 3D Micro-Nanofluidic Device for Ion-Selective Transport.", "abstract": "In the field of micro-nanofluidics, a freestanding configuration of a nanoporous junction is highly demanded to increase the design flexibility of the microscale device and the interfacial area between the nanoporous junction and microchannels, thereby improving the functionality and performance. This work first reports direct fabrication and incorporation of a freestanding nanoporous junction in a microfluidic device by performing an electrolyte-assisted electrospinning process to fabricate a freestanding nanofiber membrane and subsequently impregnating the nanofiber membrane with a nanoporous precursor material followed by a solidification process. This process also enables to readily control the geometry of the nanoporous junction depending on its application. By these advantages, vertically stacked 3D micro-nanofluidic devices with complex configurations are easily achieved. To demonstrate the broad applicability of this process in various research fields, a reverse electrodialysis-based energy harvester and an ion concentration polarization-based preconcentrator are produced. The freestanding Nafion-polyvinylidene fluoride nanofiber membrane (F-NPNM) energy harvester generates a high power (59.87 nW) owing to the enlarged interfacial area. Besides, 3D multiplexed and multi-stacked F-NPNM preconcentrators accumulate multiple preconcentrated plugs that can increase the operating sample volume and the degree of freedom of handling. Hence, the proposed process is expected to contribute to numerous research fields related to micro-nanofluidics in the future.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2020-04-30", "authors": ["JunhyunKim", "Sang MinPark", "DongwhiChoi", "Dong SungKim"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.202000998"}

Multiphysics simulations indicate that charge-carrier recombination is greatly reduced, and electron effective lifetime in p-doped GaAs may increase by a factor of 10\u00d7 to 20\u00d7. It implies a significant increase, by a factor of 2\u00d7 to 3\u00d7, of quantum efficiency (QE) for GaAs photoemission applications, like GaAs photocathodes. Conditions of different SAW wavelengths, swept SAW intensities, and varied incident photon energies were investigated.

The key question for most applications is whether they can compete in the race of down-scaling and an easy integration with highly adaptable properties into various system technologies such as nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS). Piezoelectric NEMS have potential to offer access to a parameter space for sensing, actuating, and powering, which is inflential and intriguing. Fortunately, recent advances in modelling, synthesis, and characterization techniques are spurring unprecedented developments in a new field of piezoelectric nano-materials and devices.

{"title": "Electrode Effects on Flexible and Robust Polypropylene Ferroelectret Devices for Fully Integrated Energy Harvesters.", "abstract": "This work presents a characterization study of the electrode interface in polypropylene ferroelectret nanogenerators. An emphasis is made on the comparison of carbon nanotube fiber electrodes with traditional metallic thin film electrodes. Multiple experiments were performed on samples with the same electrode dimensions for a range of applied pressures. Results showed higher open-circuit voltage peak values for the thin film metal electrodes, regardless of the applied pressure. Interestingly, the difference in short-circuit current values between metal and carbon nanotube-based fiber electrodes was not as significant. The carbon nanotube fiber electrode was further investigated by post-treating the fiber with acetone and comparing the results with untreated carbon nanotube film electrodes and thin film metal electrodes. In an effort to enable a monolithic integration of ferroelectret energy harvesters with flexible energy storage elements, this work also presents studies on generation and leakage of induced free charge in the electrodes of flexible ferroelectret energy harvesters. It was found the current leakage through parasitic elements is a faster process than dipole relaxation in the polypropylene film. Finally, an electrode reliability study shows no significant difference in the electrical output of the devices with metallic thin film electrodes after single folding but shows a significant deterioration after crumpling; meanwhile, these processes had no effect on the performance of similar devices with carbon nanotube fiber-based electrodes.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-04-29", "authors": ["JuanPastrana", "HenryDsouza", "YunqiCao", "Jos\u00e9Figueroa", "IanGonz\u00e1lez", "Juan JVilatela", "NelsonSep\u00falveda"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c02019"}
{"title": "The Design of a Frame-Like ZnO FBAR Sensor for Achieving Uniform Mass Sensitivity Distributions.", "abstract": "In this paper, an infinite circular ZnO thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) with a frame-like electrode operating at the thickness-extensional (TE) mode is studied. Two-dimensional scalar differential equations established for the problem in the Cartesian coordinate system are successfully solved by transforming them into normal Bessel equations and modified Bessel equations in the cylindrical coordinate system. Resonant frequencies and vibration distributions are obtained for this frame-like FBAR sensor. A nearly uniform mass sensitivity distribution in the active area is achieved by designing proper electrode size and mass ratio of the driving electrode to the ZnO film. Numerical results show that compared with the reported ring electrode FBAR sensor, the novel frame-like electrode FBAR can achieve a maximum optimization ratio (up to 97.90%) on the uniformity of the mass sensitivity distribution in the active area under the same structural parameters, which is also higher than the optimization ratio 77.63% obtained by the reported double-ring electrode design. Moreover, the mechanism to achieve a very uniform mass sensitivity distribution in the active area by the frame-like electrode is explained in detail according to dispersion curves. Namely, when the resonant frequency of the FBAR sensor is close to the cut-off frequency of the active region in the dispersion curve, the mass sensitivity distribution is nearly uniform. These conclusions provide a theoretical guidance for the design and optimization of ZnO FBAR mass sensors with high performance.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-04-29", "authors": ["XueliZhao", "ZinanZhao", "BinWang", "ZhenghuaQian", "TingfengMa"], "doi": "10.3390/s20082408\n10.1007/BF01337937\n10.1021/ac60215a012\n10.1109/TMECH.2004.828643\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2365240\n10.1109/MMW.2003.1266067\n10.1109/JMEMS.2005.845405\n10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00329-6\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.05.028\n10.1021/ac9706032\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2860597\n10.1063/1.324223\n10.1109/58.726433\n10.1007/s12206-015-0605-0\n10.3233/JAE-170014\n10.3233/JAE-150091\n10.1063/1.4945732\n10.1080/10584587.2018.1521670\n10.1063/1.331763"}

We may call this error the stress wave effect (SWE). In this paper, the SWE and its isolation from PPS were studied by using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). In the experimental study of SWE, when increasing the input stress, the corresponding output signal of the PPS was analyzed, and the existence of SWE was verified using the result of the spectrum analysis of the output signal. The stress wave isolation pedestal used in the stress wave isolation experiment was made of nylon and plexiglass polymer materials. The effects of the isolation pedestal's materials and length on the stress wave isolation were analyzed using the study results. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained with the data of the SWE study and was further applied to compensate the SWE error of the PPS output signal.

{"title": "Dynamic Stiffness of Bituminous Mixtures for the Wearing Course of the Road Pavement-A Proposed Method of Measurement.", "abstract": "Stiffness is an important mechanical characteristic of asphalt mixtures used in the wearing course. It is one of the determining factors in the generation of tyre/road noise. The dynamic stiffness of the upper layer of the road surface depends on the physical and mechanical properties of the materials it is composed of, and traffic load. Determination of dynamic stiffness, both in laboratory conditions and in situ, requires consideration of many other factors. Tests of dynamic properties of road surfaces in field conditions are most often conducted with the help of modal hammers. Impulse excitation results are usually less accurate than those in the application of modal exciters. The test stand was constructed, comprising a tripod, 32-channel and 24-bit data acquisition system, exciter, signal amplifier, impedance head, single-axis piezoelectric accelerometers and a stinger. The test stand and the proposed method of measuring dynamic stiffness do not require the determination of the resonance frequency of the tested specimen and can be used both on various types of bituminous mixtures of varying shape and dimensions, as well as directly on the upper surface of the wearing course of bituminous pavements. The test results showed that the type of bituminous mixture used in the wearing course significantly affects its dynamic stiffness. The dynamic stiffness level of asphalt concrete, stone mastic asphalt and porous asphalt layers was determined to be similar.

{"title": "The complexity of surface acoustic wave fields used for microfluidic applications.", "abstract": "Using surface acoustic waves (SAW) for the agitation and manipulation of fluids and immersed particles or cells in lab-on-a-chip systems has been state of the art for several years. Basic tasks comprise fluid mixing, atomization of liquids as well as sorting and separation (or trapping) of particles and cells, e.g. in so-called acoustic tweezers. Even though the fundamental principles governing SAW excitation and propagation on anisotropic, piezoelectric substrates are well-investigated, the complexity of wave field effects including SAW diffraction, refraction and interference cannot be comprehensively simulated at this point of time with sufficient accuracy. However, the design of microfluidic actuators relies on a profound knowledge of SAW propagation, including superposition of multiple SAWs, to achieve the predestined functionality of the devices. Here, we present extensive experimental results of high-resolution analysis of the lateral distribution of the complex displacement amplitude, i.e. the wave field, alongside with the electrical S-parameters of the generating transducers. These measurements were carried out and are compared in setups utilizing travelling SAW (tSAW) excited by single interdigital transducer (IDT), standing SAW generated between two IDTs (1DsSAW, 1D acoustic tweezers) and between two pairs of IDTs (2DsSAW, 2D acoustic tweezers) with different angular alignment in respect to pure Rayleigh mode propagation directions and other practically relevant orientations. For these basic configurations, typically used to drive SAW-based microfluidics, the influence of common SAW phenomena including beam steering, coupling coefficient dispersion and diffraction on the resultant wave field is investigated. The results show how tailoring of the acoustic conditions, based on profound knowledge of the physical effects, can be achieved to finally realize a desired behavior of a SAW-based microacoustic-fluidic system.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-04-26", "authors": ["RWeser", "AWinkler", "MWeihnacht", "SMenzel", "HSchmidt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106160"}

The main goals are to find the most improve cutting conditions with less energy consumption, for the drilling of reinforced polyether-ether-ketone with glass fiber at 30% (PEEK-GF30) with cooling compressed air by a Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube, and to find a balance between environmental conditions and adequate process performance. Drilling tests were carried out on plates of PEEK-GF30 to analyze the influence of cutting parameters and environmental temperature (-22, 0 and 22 \u00b0C) on variables such as thrust forces, energy and material removed rate by the use of statistical methods; analysis of variance, analysis of means, response surface, and desirability function were employed to identify the optimum region that provides the most improved values of the aforementioned variables. Drill bit diameter was also analyzed to determine the quality of drilled holes. During the drilling processes, force signals were detected by a piezoelectric dynamometer connected to multichannel amplifier and a pyrometer was used to control the temperature. The diameters of the drilled holes were measured by a coordinate measuring machine. Cooling compressed air can be considered an adequate technique to improve the results from an environmental and efficient perspective; in particular, the maximum desirability function was found at a spindle speed of 7000 rpm, a feedrate of 1 mm/rev and a temperature close to -22 \u00b0C.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-04-26", "authors": ["RosarioDomingo", "Beatrizde Agustina", "Marta Mar\u00edaMar\u00edn"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13081965\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.11.048\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.05.016\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.017\n10.1007/s40684-019-00158-6\n10.5545/sv-jme.2011.106\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.05.013\n10.1007/s00170-016-8842-7\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.235\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.095\n10.1007/s00170-015-8322-5\n10.1016/j.wear.2013.01.043\n10.3390/su10030889\n10.3390/ma11112094\n10.1007/s00170-003-1779-7\n10.3390/ma6125907\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.01.023\n10.3390/met8040215\n10.3390/ma12030386\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2004.06.003\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2011.04.007\n10.1007/s12206-017-0916-4\n10.1007/s00170-015-7284-y\n10.3390/en81112362\n10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01375-5\n10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2009.02.018\n10.1007/s00170-016-8982-9\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2018.04.011\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2006.02.012\n10.1007/s00170-016-8967-8\n10.1080/00224065.1980.11980968\n10.3390/ma12010177"}

Towards this, axi-symmetric finite element models are developed to optimize the coil parameters. The optimized length of the transmitter and the receiver coils turns out to be 10\u00a0mm (~half the wavelength) for the frequency of 300\u00a0kHz. The optimized width of the coils turns out to be 0.46\u00a0mm. FE models also show the generation, propagation and reception of L(0,2) modes in the frequency range of 250-350\u00a0kHz. The role of skin effect in the magnetostrictive based-generation of L(0,2) modes with frequency is also discussed. A transducer is designed based on the FE results. The transducer is tested for the generation of L(0,2) mode in the frequency range of 250-350\u00a0kHz in a 1\u00a0m long steam generator tube segment. A good agreement is observed between FE and experimental normalized amplitudes and the times of flight for different frequencies. L(0,2) modes are found to generate and propagate and received, as predicted by the finite element simulations. An excellent agreement is observed between the experimentally measured group velocities with those obtained from the dispersion curves in this frequency range. Experiments show the signal to noise ratio to be better than 15\u00a0dB. To ascertain the utility of the transducer in steam generator tubes for the long range testing, L(0,2) mode at 300\u00a0kHz frequency is propagated in a 1.5\u00a0m long tube. The resulted multiple end reflections amount to the propagation of 51\u00a0m distance. To check the capability of detection of defects, a short tube with a full circumferential defect of depth 0.46\u00a0mm (20%WT) and a short tube with a pin hole of 1.5\u00a0mm diameter are considered. Further, FE results for the case of the axi-symmetric circumferential defect are validated experimentally. For the case of the pinhole (non-axi-symmetric), the experimental signal to noise ratio turns out to be 6\u00a0dB, which is only 6\u00a0dB lower as compared to that obtained using a piezo based ultrasonic transducer of frequency 300\u00a0kHz coupled to the end of the tube.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-04-25", "authors": ["M MNarayanan", "VArjun", "AnishKumar", "C KMukhopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106148"}

The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate the digital planning for the correction of a gummy smile with a personalized preparation using a piezoelectric surgical guide (PerioGuide) for gingival contouring and flapless osteotomy. The guide was designed using Nemo Studio software, based on the patient's facial aesthetic analysis, through photos, videos, and facial scanning.

{"title": "Evaluation of Elastic Properties and Conductivity of Chitosan Acetate Films in Ammonia and Water Vapors Using Acoustic Resonators.", "abstract": "Novel bio-materials, like chitosan and its derivatives, appeal to finding a new niche in room temperature gas sensors, demonstrating not only a chemoresistive response, but also changes in mechanical impedance due to vapor adsorption. We determined the coefficients of elasticity and viscosity of chitosan acetate films in air, ammonia, and water vapors by acoustic spectroscopy. The measurements were carried out while using a resonator with a longitudinal electric field at the different concentrations of ammonia (100-1600 ppm) and air humidity (20-60%). It was established that, in the presence of ammonia, the longitudinal and shear elastic modules significantly decreased, whereas, in water vapor, they changed slightly. At that, the viscosity of the films increased greatly upon exposure to both vapors. We found that the film's conductivity increased by two and one orders of magnitude, respectively, in ammonia and water vapors. The effect of analyzed vapors on the resonance properties of a piezoelectric resonator with a lateral electric field that was loaded by a chitosan film on its free side was also experimentally studied. In these vapors, the parallel resonance frequency and maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance decreased, especially in ammonia. The results of a theoretical analysis of the resonance properties of such a sensor in the presence of vapors turned out to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. It has been also found that with a growth in the concentration of the studied vapors, a decrease in the elastic constants, and an increase in the viscosity factor and conductivity lead to reducing the parallel resonance frequency and the maximum value of the real part of the electric impedance of the piezoelectric resonator with a lateral electric field that was loaded with a chitosan film.

The ultrathin separation layer of graphene oxide (thickness of 380 nm) was successfully deposited onto porous polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid intermediate layer on nonwoven support layer using vacuum filtration. The graphene oxide addition in the composite membrane caused an increased hydrophilicity and negative surface charge than those of the membrane without graphene oxide. In the filtration process using a graphene oxide composite membrane, the permeance values of pure water, dyes, folic acid and bovine serum albumin molecules were more severely decreased (by two orders of magnitude) than those of the nonwoven/polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid composite membrane. However, the rejection efficiency of the graphene oxide composite was significantly improved in cationic Rhodamine B (from 9% to 80.3%) and anionic methyl orange (from 28.3% to 86.6%) feed solutions. The folic acid and bovine serum albumin were nearly completely rejected from solutions using either nonwoven/polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid or nonwoven/polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid/graphene oxide composite membrane, but the latter possessed anti-fouling property against the protein molecules. The separation mechanism in nonwoven/polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid membrane includes the Donnan exclusion effect (for smaller-than-pore-size solutes) and sieving mechanism (for larger solutes). The sieving mechanism governs the filtration behavior in the nonwoven/polyvinylidene fluoride-polyacrylic acid/graphene oxide composite membrane.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-04-25", "authors": ["FebriBaskoro", "SelvarajRajesh Kumar", "ShingjiangJessie Lue"], "doi": "10.3390/nano10040792\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.10.127\n10.1039/C8RA03156H\n10.4172/2155-9589.1000179\n10.1016/j.cej.2017.09.147\n10.3390/nano8020065\n10.1039/C7CP08281A\n10.3390/membranes8010013\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.11.036\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.05.102\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.10.028\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.115940\n10.1016/j.jtice.2018.03.047\n10.1002/app.48416\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.08.126\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.116099\n10.1016/j.seppur.2019.116007\n10.3390/membranes8030070\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.091\n10.1016/j.jtice.2013.04.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.006\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.114178\n10.1002/pat.3167\n10.1002/app.47068\n10.1021/am503721k\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.074\n10.1007/978-3-319-64501-8_9\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.10.020\n10.3390/polym12020495\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227293\n10.1016/j.coche.2017.03.002\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03780\n10.1016/j.carbon.2017.01.099\n10.1021/acs.est.7b06081\n10.1002/pat.4472\n10.1002/pen.24930\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.05.162\n10.1039/C5RA04439A\n10.1039/C9RA03337H\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.07.007\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.020\n10.2166/wrd.2016.072\n10.1039/C4RA16982D\n10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00334\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.10.069\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.08.030\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.12.070\n10.3390/nano8030163\n10.1016/j.jece.2013.05.014\n10.1081/DDC-120025871\n10.1021/acsnano.8b04187\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.09.028\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.060\n10.3390/ma11030394\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2019.122400\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.08.017\n10.1039/b801491d\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.10.048\n10.1002/bmb.2003.494031050261"}

The incorporation of magnetostrictive cobalt ferrites (CFO) into PHBV matrix enables the production of magnetically responsive composites, which proved to be effective in the differentiation of a variety of cells and tissues. In this work, PHBV and PHBV with CFO nanoparticles were produced in the form of films, fibers and porous scaffolds and subjected to an experimental program allowing to evaluate the degradation process under biological conditions for a period up to 8 weeks. The morphology, physical, chemical and thermal properties were evaluated, together with the weight loss of the samples during the in vitro degradation assays. No major changes in the mentioned properties were found, thus proving its applicability for tissue engineering applications. Degradation was apparent from week 4 and onwards, leading to the conclusion that the degradation ratio of the material is suitable for a large range of tissue engineering applications. Further, it was found that the degradation of the samples maintain the biocompatibility of the materials for the pristine polymer, but can lead to cytotoxic effects when the magnetic CFO nanoparticles are exposed, being therefore needed, for magnetoactive applications, to substitute them by biocompatible ferrites, such as an iron oxide (Fe", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2020-04-25", "authors": ["LuisAmaro", "Daniela MCorreia", "Pedro MMartins", "GabrielaBotelho", "S\u00f3nia A CCarabineiro", "ClarisseRibeiro", "SenentxuLanceros-Mendez"], "doi": "10.3390/polym12040953\n10.1080/15583724.2010.537800\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00339-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.039\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00878.x\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.050\n10.1016/j.jcis.2016.05.012\n10.1002/jbm.b.33674\n10.3390/ijms19082149\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.09.004\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.07.099\n10.1002/bit.25918\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.08.043\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.07.044\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/0041-624X(68)90132-7\n10.1038/213267a0\n10.1016/j.apmt.2019.04.004\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104459\n10.1002/adfm.201202780\n10.1080/00150193.2014.923670\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.03.055\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.06.023\n10.3390/s17061251\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.12.055\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.12.046\n10.1038/nbt0794-689\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.08.041\n10.1021/ma002120x\n10.1590/1516-1439.235613\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.043\n10.1016/j.jddst.2017.09.017\n10.1016/j.matlet.2006.06.062\n10.1016/j.jddst.2019.02.007\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00121-6\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/1/015003\n10.1179/0020296713Z.000000000157\n10.1186/s41232-018-0059-8\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.04.036\n10.1016/j.matlet.2007.09.036\n10.1016/B978-0-08-100596-5.22502-X\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-3927(20000201)21:3<117::AID-MARC117>3.0.CO;2-X\n10.1002/app.45726\n10.1007/s10237-015-0698-5\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.06.007\n10.1557/adv.2018.223\n10.1021/acsami.9b14001\n10.1002/jbm.a.10482\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00445-3\n10.1002/app.38506\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.03.017\n10.1016/S1002-0071(12)60086-0\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2009.01.013\n10.1002/jbm.a.30575\n10.1016/j.msec.2008.07.026\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.08.051\n10.2174/157341311795542435"}
{"title": "A Deep Learning Framework for Vibration-Based Assessment of Delamination in Smart Composite Laminates.", "abstract": "Delamination is one of the detrimental defects in laminated composite materials that often arose due to manufacturing defects or in-service loadings (e.g., low/high velocity impacts). Most of the contemporary research efforts are dedicated to high-frequency guided wave and mode shape-based methods for the assessment (i.e., detection, quantification, localization) of delamination. This paper presents a deep learning framework for structural vibration-based assessment of delamination in smart composite laminates. A number of small-sized (4.5% of total area) inner and edge delaminations are simulated using an electromechanically coupled model of the piezo-bonded laminated composite. Healthy and delaminated structures are stimulated with random loads and the corresponding transient responses are transformed into spectrograms using optimal values of window size, overlapping rate, window type, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) resolution. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to automatically extract discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms and use those to distinguish the intact and delaminated cases of the smart composite laminate. The proposed architecture of the convolutional neural network showed a training accuracy of 99.9%, validation accuracy of 97.1%, and test accuracy of 94.5% on an unseen data set.

Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, known as a low-cost, environment-friendly, and hydrophilic inorganic material, have been used by worldwide researchers. As claimed by the scientific literatures, ZnO nanoparticles can not only endow the polymeric membranes with antifouling performance but also supply a photocatalytic self-cleaning ability. Therefore, polymer-ZnO composite membranes were considered to be an attractive hot topic in membrane technology. In the last decades, it has been significantly matured by a large mass of literature reports. The current review highlights the latest findings in polymeric membranes incorporated with ZnO nanoparticles for membrane fouling mitigation. The membrane fouling, ZnO nanoparticles, and modification technology were introduced in the first three sections. Particularly, the review makes a summary of the reports of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-ZnO composite membranes, polyethersulfone (PES)-ZnO composite membranes, and other composite membranes incorporated with ZnO nanoparticles. This review further points out several crucial topics for the future development of polymer-ZnO composite membranes.", "journal": "Frontiers in chemistry", "date": "2020-04-24", "authors": ["LiguoShen", "ZhengyiHuang", "YingLiu", "RenjieLi", "YanchaoXu", "GjonJakaj", "HongjunLin"], "doi": "10.3389/fchem.2020.00224\n10.1080/19443994.2014.910137\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)80932-1\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.03.008\n10.1021/ie0108088\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.10.025\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.06.124\n10.1039/c3ee43385d\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.10.024\n10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.028\n10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.010\n10.1016/j.watres.2010.02.039\n10.1016/S0376-7388(96)00244-X\n10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00082-6\n10.1039/B917103G\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.08.008\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.038\n10.1038/517006a\n10.1016/S0376-7388(96)00351-1\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.01.051\n10.1016/j.cep.2005.11.002\n10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.040\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.10.026\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.001\n10.1016/j.memsci.2009.01.012\n10.1016/j.cherd.2014.08.017\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.02.017\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.02.003\n10.1016/j.envpol.2010.03.024\n10.1016/j.jcis.2017.11.061\n10.1016/j.watres.2004.05.007\n10.1021/nl1037962\n10.1021/es0017099\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.12.036\n10.1016/j.desal.2005.12.077\n10.1016/j.seppur.2012.01.002\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.016\n10.1016/j.carres.2010.03.019\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.04.072\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.262\n10.1039/C5RA05783C\n10.3389/fchem.2019.00877\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.12.040\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2006.01.027\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.019\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.02.034\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.022\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1016/S0921-5107(00)00604-8\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00422-7\n10.2166/wst.2017.194\n10.1016/j.watres.2008.12.044\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.11.033\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.11.023\n10.1039/c0ee00541j\n10.37358/MP.18.1.4963\n10.1016/j.seppur.2015.10.015\n10.1016/S0376-7388(01)00368-4\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.10.043\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.040\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.019\n10.1016/j.jcis.2017.01.051\n10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.090\n10.1016/j.cej.2015.02.002\n10.2166/aqua.2008.048\n10.1016/j.memsci.2005.11.024\n10.1016/S0376-7388(00)85121-2\n10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.032\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.086\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126013\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.09.042\n10.1016/j.biortech.2015.06.091\n10.1002/ep.670220116\n10.1126/science.aac6009\n10.1002/9781118888735\n10.1016/j.memsci.2003.07.004\n10.1166/sam.2011.1144\n10.1021/acsami.6b04083\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125801\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125446\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.083\n10.1016/j.desal.2010.11.023\n10.1016/j.watres.2017.11.034\n10.1016/j.biortech.2014.10.058\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.08.004\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2012.07.002\n10.1016/j.jcis.2015.01.009\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.050\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.04.054"}

{"title": "Electrostatic charged nanofiber filter for filtering airborne novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and nano-aerosols.", "abstract": "The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Within four months since outbreak in December 2019, over 2.6 million people have been infected across 210 countries around the globe with over 180,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140\u00a0nm with mean size of 100 nm (i.e. nano-aerosol). The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95, N99 and N100 respirators set at 300-nm aerosol, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100-nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the fast-spreading, deadly airborne coronavirus, especially COVID-19, with our target aerosol size set at 100\u00a0nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300\u00a0nm. The virus and its attached aerosol were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50-500\u00a0nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers, which were uniform in diameter, straight and bead-free, were produced with average fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525\u00a0nm, respectively, with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently electrostatically charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency yet much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules with lower fiber packing density, with each module separated by a permeable, electrical-insulator material, the electrical interference between neighboring charged fibers was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter together with lower fiber packing density in each module both further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amounts of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required larger amounts of fibers per module to compensate for the poorer performance provided it did not incur significantly additional pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100-nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop not to exceed 30\u00a0Pa (3.1\u00a0mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18\u00a0Pa (1.9\u00a0mm water) while another filter meeting the 30\u00a0Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, as well as nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to undesirable chronic diseases.", "journal": "Separation and purification technology", "date": "2020-04-24", "authors": ["Wallace Woon FongLeung", "QiangqiangSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116886\n10.1056/NEJMc2001468\n10.1056/NEJMoa2001017"}

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Outcomes.", "abstract": "Osteotomy of nasal bones in rhinoplasty is associated with postsurgical morbidities. Recent evidence has suggested that a surgical method applying piezoelectric ultrasound waves for nasal osteotomies in rhinoplasty reduces soft tissue damage and causes less postsurgical morbidities compared to conventional methods. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of piezoelectric and conventional lateral nasal osteotomies in rhinoplasty.\nWe searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Web of Science up to 17 August 2019 for studies comparing postoperative outcomes of piezoelectric and conventional lateral osteotomies in rhinoplasty. We included studies comparing results of patients subjected to piezoelectric or conventional lateral nasal osteotomies in rhinoplasty. For outcomes, we considered postoperative pain, eyelid edema, periorbital ecchymosis, and intraoperative mucosal injury.\nFor eyelid edema, a statistically significant difference in favor of piezoelectric osteotomy was documented within the first 3 postoperative days (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.65; 95% CI = -1.18, -0.12, p = 0.02; I2 = 69%) and on postoperative day 7 (SMD = -0.69; 95% CI = -1.47, -0.09; p = 0.08; I2 = 85%). This was also the case for periorbital ecchymosis within the first 3 postoperative days (SMD = -0.85; 95% CI = -1.42, -0.28; p = 0.004; I2 = 72%) and on postoperative day 7 (SMD = -0.52; 95% CI = -0.79, -0.24; p = 0.0003; I2 = 71%).

{"title": "The Application of \"Bone Window\" Technique in Endodontic Microsurgery.", "abstract": "Endodontic microsurgery for a tooth with a large periapical lesion and an intact cortical plate may necessitate the removal of extra bone and cause delayed or unfavorable healing. In such cases, the \"bone window\" technique offers excellent exposure to the operative field and preserves cortical bone without placing any additional graft material. In the reported cases, root-end surgery was performed on the maxillary and mandibular molars with a large periapical lesion. The bone window was fashioned with the aid of thin osteotomy instruments and repositioned to the original site at the end of the procedure, which resulted in minimizing bone loss and acted as an autologous graft for the surgical site. At 12- and 16-month follow-ups, clinical examinations and cone-beam computed tomographic scans revealed the healing of the lesion without symptoms or complications. Cone-beam computed tomographic imaging was used as a presurgical assessment tool for indication selection and precise design of the bone window. The use of a bone window in endodontic microsurgery, which appears to be a reliable technique, should be the method of preference when the large lesion is deeply positioned between intact buccal and lingual cortices.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2020-04-22", "authors": ["Su-MinLee", "Ya-HsinYu", "YuWang", "EuiseongKim", "SyngcukKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2020.02.009"}

We demonstrate a label-free microfabricated thickness shear mode electroacoustic device based on a ZnO piezoelectric film for the assay of cardiac biomarkers. This device combines an immunologic sensitive element with the resonator working in biological liquids. Based on the gravimetric mechanism, the immunoreaction between the target antigens and antibodies was detected by monitoring the frequency change in real-time to determine the concentration of cardiac troponins I. The device exhibits a linear response from 0.04 to 2\u00a0ng/ml and a low detection limit of 20\u00a0pg/ml in serum containing cardiac troponin I. The clinical samples collected from healthy controls and cardiac patients were directly used without any additional pre-treatment. The cardiac troponin concentrations measured by the proposed device shows good linear correlation and consistency compared with standard laboratory methods.

These include photodetectors, field-effect transistors, piezoelectric devices, modulators, and energy harvesting devices. However, as a new member of the 2D material family, much less known is about 2D Te compared to other 2D materials. Motivated by this lack of knowledge, we review the recent progress of research into 2D Te nanoflakes. Firstly, we introduce the background and motivation of this review. Then, the crystal structures and synthesis methods are presented, followed by an introduction to their physical properties and applications.

While the vibration propagation usually impedes this localization, we show in this article that narrow strip-shaped plates constitute waveguides in which bending waves below a cut-off frequency do not propagate. We provide a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon and experimental validations. We thus show that vibrations up to a few kHz are well confined on top of the actuated area with vibration amplitude over 1 micrometer. The principle was validated with piezoelectric actuators of various shapes and a linear resonant actuator (LRA). Investigation of the effect of a fingertip load on the system through theory and experimentation was conducted and revealed that almost no attenuation was brought by the fingertip when using low frequency evanescent waves. Finally, a perceptual validation was conducted and showed dynamic stimuli with a large frequency spectrum could be felt and distinguished.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on haptics", "date": "2020-04-20", "authors": ["Ayoub BenDhiab", "CharlesHudin"], "doi": "10.1109/TOH.2020.2986727"}
{"title": "Perfluoroalkyl substances in sediments from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic: Source and pathway analysis.", "abstract": "Although perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are ubiquitous in the Arctic, their dominant pathways to the Arctic remain unclear. Most modeling studies support major oceanic transport for PFASs in the Arctic seawater, but this conclusion contradicts the rapid response of PFASs to global emissions in some biota species. Sediments, which act as important PFAS sinks for seawater and potential PFAS source to the benthic food web, are important for interpreting the fate of PFASs in the Arctic. Here we investigate the occurrence of 9 PFASs in one core (1945-2014) and 29 surface sediments from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic. Total PFAS concentrations (0.06-1.73\u00a0ng/g dw) in surface sediments were dominated by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorobutyl sulfonate (PFBS), with higher levels in the Bering Sea slope and the northeast Chukchi Sea. Historical trends in PFASs varied among individuals, with PFOS declining in the early 2000s while PFNA showing an increasing up-core trend. Analysis of positive matrix factorization model identified that the major PFAS sources in the sediment core were dominated by the atmospheric oxidation of consumer use of PFOS precursor-based products (45.0%), while the oceanic transport of fluoropolymer manufacture of polyvinylidene fluoride (mainly PFNA) exhibited an increasing trend over time, becoming dominant in surface sediments (42.8%). Besides, local input of possible aqueous fire-fighting foams (mainly PFOS and PFBS) also acted as an important source currently (30.1%) and historically (34.9%). Our study revealed that the pathways of PFASs in Arctic sediments varied greatly for individuals and the conclusion of PFOS originating from mainly atmospheric oxidation was different from seawater modeling results. This, together with the high possibility of sediments as direct source to Arctic food web (supported by similar PFAS compositions and temporal variations), help provide additional evidence regarding PFAS pathways to the Arctic.", "journal": "Environment international", "date": "2020-04-20", "authors": ["YanLin", "Jheng-JieJiang", "Lisa ARodenburg", "MinggangCai", "ZhaiWu", "HongweiKe", "MahdiChitsaz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2020.105699"}

These material systems smartly control the addition/removal of material in locations of high/low mechanical stress by utilizing local resources guided by biological signals. On the contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Inspired by the mineralization process of bone, a material system that adapts its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading is reported. It is found that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization from surrounding media. It is shown that the material system can adapt to external mechanical loading by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the stress and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mineralization mechanism allows a simple one-step route for fabricating functionally graded materials by controlling the stress distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class of self-regenerating materials that reinforce regions of high stress or induce deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in mechanical stress to prevent/mitigate failure.

{"title": "Design, Implementation, and Validation of a Piezoelectric Device to Study the Effects of Dynamic Mechanical Stimulation on Cell Proliferation, Migration and Morphology.", "abstract": "Cell functions and behavior are regulated not only by soluble (biochemical) signals but also by biophysical and mechanical cues within the cells' microenvironment. Thanks to the dynamical and complex cell machinery, cells are genuine and effective mechanotransducers translating mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals, which eventually alter multiple aspects of their own homeostasis. Given the dominant and classic biochemical-based views to explain biological processes, it could be challenging to elucidate the key role that mechanical parameters such as vibration, frequency, and force play in biology. Gaining a better understanding of how mechanical stimuli (and their mechanical parameters associated) affect biological outcomes relies partially on the availability of experimental tools that may allow researchers to alter mechanically the cell's microenvironment and observe cell responses. Here, we introduce a new device to study in vitro responses of cells to dynamic mechanical stimulation using a piezoelectric membrane. Using this device, we can flexibly change the parameters of the dynamic mechanical stimulation (frequency, amplitude, and duration of the stimuli), which increases the possibility to study the cell behavior under different mechanical excitations. We report on the design and implementation of such device and the characterization of its dynamic mechanical properties. By using this device, we have performed a preliminary study on the effect of dynamic mechanical stimulation in a cell monolayer of an epidermal cell line (HaCaT) studying the effects of 1 Hz and 80 Hz excitation frequencies (in the dynamic stimuli) on HaCaT cell migration, proliferation, and morphology. Our preliminary results indicate that the response of HaCaT is dependent on the frequency of stimulation.

{"title": "Monitoring of Interfacial Debonding of Concrete Filled Pultrusion-GFRP Tubular Column Based on Piezoelectric Smart Aggregate and Wavelet Analysis.", "abstract": "The concrete filled pultrusion-GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) tubular column (CFGC) is popular in hydraulic structures or regions with poor environmental conditions due to its excellent corrosion resistance. Considering the influence of concrete hydration heat, shrinkage, and creep, debonding may occur in the interface between the GFRP tube and the concrete, which will greatly reduce the cooperation of the GFRP tube and concrete, and will weaken the mechanical property of CFGC. This paper introduces an active monitoring method based on the piezoelectric transducer. In the active sensing approach, the smart aggregate (SA) embedded in the concrete acted as a driver to transmit a modulated stress wave, and the PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) patches attached on the outer surface of CFGC serve as sensors to receive signals and transfer them to the computer for saving. Two groups of experiments were designed with the different debonding areas and thicknesses. The artificial damage of CFGC was identified and located by comparing the value of the delay under pulse excitation and the difference of wavelet-based energy under sweep excitation, and the damage indexes were defined based on the wavelet packet energy to quantify the level of the interface damage. The results showed that the debonding damage area of CFGC can be identified effectively through the active monitoring method, and the damage index can accurately reflect the damage level of the interface of GFRP tube and concrete. Therefore, this method can be used to identify and evaluate the interface debonding of CFGC in real time. In addition, if the method can be combined with remote sensing technology, it can be used as a real-time remote sensing monitoring technology to provide a solution for interface health monitoring of CFGC.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-04-16", "authors": ["WenweiYang", "XiaYang", "ShuntaoLi"], "doi": "10.3390/s20072149\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2010.11.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.06.017\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000121\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.208\n10.1016/j.jcsr.2011.08.002\n10.1016/S0143-974X(02)00076-7\n10.2749/222137810796012234\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.117-119.887\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001604\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.053\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2005.08.017\n10.3390/s17030657\n10.1177/1045389X14536010\n10.3390/s16122083\n10.1007/s13349-016-0180-9\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6ae8\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2007.07.002\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab1f27\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/017\n10.1016/j.finel.2003.03.001\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/6/007\n10.1006/jsvi.1994.1104\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/3/035018\n10.1177/1045389X15586452\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065002\n10.1002/eqe.307\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.10.006\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2018.06.002\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2018.04.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.02.002\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.007\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/2/010\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2790902\n10.3390/s18051563\n10.3390/s18093100\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.01.017\n10.1109/34.192463\n10.1016/S0098-1354(02)00160-6\n10.1177/1475921706067741"}

{"title": "Sensing Ability of Ferroelectric Oxide Nanowires Grown in Templates of Nanopores.", "abstract": "Nanowires of ferroelectric potassium niobate were grown by filling nanoporous templates of both side opened anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) through radiofrequency vacuum sputtering for multisensor fabrication. The precise geometrical ordering of the AAO matrix led to well defined single axis oriented wire-shaped material inside the pores. The sensing abilities of the samples were studied and analyzed in terms of piezoelectric and pyroelectric response and the results were compared for different length of the nanopores (nanotubes)-1.3 \u00b5m, 6.3 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m. Based on scanning electronic microscopy, elemental and microstructural analyses, as well as electrical measurements at bending and heating, the overall sensing performance of the devices was estimated. It was found that the produced membrane type elements, consisting potassium niobate grown in AAO template exhibited excellent piezoelectric response due to the increased specific area as compared to non-structured films, and could be further enhanced with the nanowires length. The piezoelectric voltage increased linearly with 16 mV per micrometer of nanowire's length. At the same time the pyroelectric voltage was found to be less sensitive to the nanowires length, changing its value at 400 nV/\u00b5m.

{"title": "Enhanced nano-aerosol loading performance of multilayer PVDF nanofiber electret filters.", "abstract": "Aerosol loading behavior of PVDF nanofiber electret filters using neutrally charged nano- and submicron aerosols was investigated experimentally for the first time. The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11\u00a0Pa gsm", "journal": "Separation and purification technology", "date": "2020-04-15", "authors": ["QiangqiangSun", "Wallace Woon-FongLeung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606"}

{"title": "Intravascular Ultrasound Transducer by Using Polarization Inversion Technique for Tissue Harmonic Imaging: Modeling and Experiments.", "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) tissue harmonic imaging (THI) is a useful vessel imaging technique that can provide deep penetration depth as well as high spatial and contrast resolution. Typically, a high-frequency IVUS transducer for THI requires a broad bandwidth or dual-frequency bandwidth. However, it is very difficult to make an IVUS transducer with a frequency bandwidth covering from the fundamental frequency to the second harmonic or a dual-peak at the desired frequency. To solve this problem, in this study, we applied the polarization inversion technique (PIT) to the IVUS transducer for THI. The PIT makes it relatively easy to design IVUS transducers with suitable frequency characteristics for THI depending on the inversion ratio of the piezoelectric layer and specifications of the passive materials. In this study, two types of IVUS transducers based on the PIT were developed for THI. One is a front-side inversion layer (FSIL) transducer with a broad bandwidth, and the other is a back-side inversion layer (BSIL) transducer with a dual-frequency bandwidth.

The grand challenge for mimicking such natural intelligence in miniature robots lies in achieving highly integrated body functionality, actuation, and sensing mechanisms. Here, somatosensory light-driven robots (SLiRs) based on a smart thin-film composite tightly integrating actuation and multisensing are presented. The SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non-interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of low-profile structures for morphable, mobile, and multiple robotic functionality. For example, an SLiR walker can move forward on different surfaces, while providing feedback on its detailed locomotive gaits and subtle terrain textures, and an SLiR anthropomorphic hand shows bodily senses arising from concerted mechanoreception, thermoreception, proprioception, and photoreception. Untethered operation with an SLiR centipede is also demonstrated, which can execute distinct, localized body functions from directional motility, multisensing, to wireless human and environment interactions. This SLiR, which is capable of integrated perception and motility, offers new opportunities for developing diverse intelligent behaviors in soft robots.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2020-04-15", "authors": ["Xiao-QiaoWang", "Kwok HoeChan", "YinCheng", "TianpengDing", "TongtaoLi", "SippanatAchavananthadith", "SelmanAhmet", "John SHo", "Ghim WeiHo"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202000351"}
{"title": "Evaluating the Efficacy of a Modified Piezo-Puncture Method on the Rate of Tooth Movement in Orthodontic Patients: A Clinical Study.", "abstract": "Owing to the increasing demand from orthodontic patients for a more rapid treatment, many studies have focused on accelerated tooth movement. Currently, one of the prevalent methods to achieve accelerated tooth movement is piezo-puncture. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified piezo-puncture method on tooth movement rate and type during canine retraction.\nA total of 17 patients who required fixed orthodontic treatment with extraction of the maxillary first premolars were included in the study. Following a split-mouth design, upper canines were retracted with Ni-Ti coil spring that applied 150 g of force on each side (piezo-puncture on one side and contralateral side served as the control). Then, the rates of tooth movement, canine angulation and rotation, and anchorage loss were evaluated at T0 (before the intervention), T1 (1 month after the intervention), and T2 (2 months after the intervention). For calculating the canine movement rate, either the distance between the canine and the lateral incisor or the space between the second premolar and the canine was measured. In addition, pain perception was documented by Visual Analog Scale. Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, Spearman correlation test, paired sample t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nNo significant acceleration was observed in canine movement, canine tipping, rotation, or anchorage loss of molar in different times.\nConsidering the limitations of the study, the application of piezo-puncture employing the protocol used in the present study failed to accelerate tooth movement and to decrease the unfavorable tipping, rotation, and molar anchorage loss.", "journal": "Turkish journal of orthodontics", "date": "2020-04-15", "authors": ["MaryamOmidkhoda", "MehrdadRadvar", "MajidAzizi", "MahboobeDehghani"], "doi": "10.5152/TurkJOrthod.2020.19013\n10.1051/orthodfr/2019002\n10.1177/10454411910020040101\n10.1016/0030-4220(59)90177-X\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2006.08.014\n10.1186/2196-1042-14-42\n10.1186/2196-1042-14-42\n10.2319/020308-60.1\n10.4103/2321-3825.116288\n10.4103/2321-3825.116288\n10.1002/9781118937853.ch5\n10.4317/medoral.21082\n10.1093/ejo/cjt079\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2015.03.031\n10.2319/032213-234.1\n10.1111/ocr.12166\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2013.01.022\n10.2319/062510-348.1\n10.2319/011707-24.1\n10.1159/000351897\n10.1053/j.sodo.2012.06.007\n10.1053/j.sodo.2015.06.002\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2013.06.017\n10.2319/052015-343.1\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2015.09.029\n10.1016/j.ajodo.2013.10.020"}

Work function (WF) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level shift observed from UPS spectroscopy for successive deposition of CuPc molecules on ferroelectric polymer surfaces confirm the formation of interface dipole at the CuPc-ferroelectric polymer interface owing to charge transfer from the tailing region of the CuPc HOMO density of states (DOS) to the ferroelectric polymer layer. According to our thickness dependent XPS data, CuPc molecules are coupled to the organic ferroelectric surfaces through the central metal atom of the CuPc molecules, i.e., copper atom, and the halogens of underlying ferroelectric polymer surfaces, and hence support the charge transfer phenomenon from CuPc molecules to the ferroelectric polymer substrate. Polarization dependent NEXAFS results reveal that CuPc molecules retain their tilted geometrical configuration even at submonolayer thickness of the molecular films on both ferroelectric surfaces and confirms the electronic structural disturbance associated with structural modification of CuPc molecules due to interfacial charge transfer. Therefore, the energy level alignment with increment in the thickness of CuPc films at both the organic semiconductor-ferroelectric polymer interface is controlled by the charge transfer phenomenon from deposited CuPc molecules to the organic ferroelectric substrates.

{"title": "Damage localization in piezo-ceramic using ultrasonic waves excited by dual point contact excitation and detection scheme.", "abstract": "A novel experimental technique based on point contact and Coulomb coupling is devised and optimized for ultrasonic imaging of bulk and guided waves propagation in piezo-ceramics. The Coulomb coupling technique exploits the coupling and transfer of electric field to mechanical vibrations by excitation of phonons. The point contact excitation and detection technique facilitates the spatial-temporal imaging of ultrasonic waves. The motivation of this research is the diagnosis and localization of surface cracks in the piezoelectric sensors and actuators. The underlying principle of the detection scheme is that any discontinuity on the surface causes high localization of electric gradient. The localized electric field at the defect boundaries enables then to behave as secondary passive ultrasonic sources resulting in strong back reflections. However, due to the interference between transmitted and reflected wave components from rigid boundaries and defect, the resolution on the localization of the damage is challenging. Therefore, an algorithm based on the two-dimensional spectral decomposition is utilized for selective suppression of the transmitted wave. The algorithm includes data transformation and vectorization in polar coordinates for efficient spectral decomposition. In the spectral domain, the complex wave component (phase and amplitude) are suppressed for the transmitted wave field. The reflected wave component in the spectral domain is retained and retrieved back using inverse spectral transformation. The algorithm is successful in retaining and exemplifying only the reflected wave sources arising from the strong scattering of ultrasonic waves from the surface and sub-surface defects.

The scanner shares part of PZT by fixing a sapphire frame onto the front quarter of PZT to construct a compact tip-sample loop, realising an outer diameter of 8.8\u00a0mm, which makes it compatible with a narrow sample space. Its main components are made of non-metallic materials of sapphire, which allows it to be immune from eddy currents and to operate under the condition of strong magnetic field fluctuation from a hybrid magnet, as well as cryogen-free cryocooler magnet systems. To analyse the stiffness of the STM head unit, the eigenfrequencies with 11\u00a0kHz and 12\u00a0kHz in bending modes, 25\u00a0kHz in a torsional mode, and 67\u00a0kHz in a longitudinal mode were simulated by finite element analysis; also, the drifting rates of the STM in ambient conditions in the X-Y plane and Z direction were measured at 25.5 and 38.2 pm/min, respectively.

{"title": "Active Actuating of a Simply Supported Beam with the Flexoelectric Effect.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials with the electro-mechanical coupling effect have been widely utilized in sensors, dampers, actuators, and so on. Engineering structures with piezoelectric actuators and sensors have provided great improvement in terms of vibration and noise reduction. The flexoelectric effect-which describes the coupling effect between the polarization gradient and strain, and between the strain gradient and electric polarization in solids-has a fourth-rank order tensor electro-mechanical coupling coefficient, and in principle makes the flexoelectricity existing in all insulating materials and promises an even wider application potential in vibration and noise control. In the presented work, a flexoelectric actuator was designed to actuate a simply supported beam. The electric field gradient was generated by an atomic force microscopy probe. Flexoelectric control force and moment components could be induced within the flexoelectric control layer. As flexoelectricity is size-dependent, the key parameters that could affect the actuating effect were examined in case studies.

{"title": "Beneficial CNT Intermediate Layer for Membrane Fluorination toward Robust Superhydrophobicity and Wetting Resistance in Membrane Distillation.", "abstract": "Robust membrane hydrophobicity is crucial in membrane distillation (MD) to produce clean water, yet challenged by wetting phenomenon. We herein proposed a robust superhydrophobization process, by\u00a0making use of a carbon nanotube (CNT) intermediate layer over commercial hydrophobic membrane, indirectly grafting the low-surface-energy material 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FAS),\u00a0with the achieved membrane\u00a0denoted as PVDF-CNT-FAS, in systematic comparison with direct grafting FAS on alkalinized PVDF denoted as PVDF-OH-FAS. Superhydrophobicity with water contact angle of 180\u00b0 was easily achieved from initial hydrophilic interface for both two resultant membranes. Interestingly, the existence of a CNT intermediate layer significantly maintained the stable hydrophobicity in various harsh conditions and improved mechanical properties, at an expense of ca. 20% smaller pore size and extended membrane thickness than PVDF-OH-FAS. In the MD experiment, the PVDF-CNT-FAS exhibited no vapor flux sacrifice, giving constant flux with the control and doubled that for PVDF-OH-FAS. A mass-heat transfer modeling suggested no significant heat loss but facilitated vapor flux with the CNT layer, unlike the impeded transfer for the counterpart\u00a0membrane. A superior wetting resistance against 0.4 mM SDS further confirmed the benefit of constructing the CNT intermediate layer, presumably because of its excellent slippery property. This study demonstrates the important role of the CNT intermediate layer toward robust superhydrophobic membrane, suggesting the interest of applying the functional nanomaterial for controllable interface design.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-04-11", "authors": ["YutingWang", "MinyuanHan", "LangLiu", "JingmeiYao", "LeHan"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.0c03577"}

Here we present an acoustic microchip integrating modification and detection for in-situ analysis. Such microchip employs two pairs of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) for acoustic field generation and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microcavity on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate for producing microparticle array. The applying of acoustic field results in rapidly forming microparticle array by adjusting the inputting frequency and voltage. In-situ modification and detection are accelerated due to the dynamic ultrasonic streaming around the ultrasound induced microparticle array. Such array also benefits from reducing the detection errors by coupling of multiple points. With this strategy, biomarkers (e.g. miRNA) can be enriched, and achieve in-situ modification and detection via simple two steps with excellent specificity. After the detection, samples are regained from the output channel by releasing the acoustic field, which is benefit for further analysis.

Formation of Schottky junction between semiconductors and plasmonic metals can broaden the light absorption and facilitate the photon-generated carriers separation. To further amplify the catalytic performance, herein, an asymmetric gold-zinc oxide (Asy-Au-ZnO) nanorod array is rationally designed, which realizes the synergy of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, as well as spatially oriented electron-hole pairs separation, generating a significantly enhanced catalytic performance. In addition to conventional properties from noble metal/semiconductor Schottky junction, the rationally designed heterostructure has several additional advantages: 1) The piezoelectric ZnO under light and mechanical stress can directly generate charge carriers; 2) the Schottky barrier can be reduced by ZnO piezopotential to enhance the injection efficiency of hot electrons from Au nanoparticles to ZnO; 3) the unique asymmetric nanorod array structure can achieve a spatially directed separation and migration of the photon-generated carriers. When ultrasound and all-spectrum light irradiation are exerted simultaneously, the Asy-Au-ZnO reaches the highest catalytic efficiency of 95% in 75 min for dye degradation.

The mirror motion mechanism is based on a long-travel piezo-based linear translation stage with built-in position feedback. The step-scan arrangement allows for signal integration, making the instrument suitable for measurements of less intensive radiation sources and for the photon-counting technique. The spectrometer consists of two coupled Michelson interferometers, one for the spectrometer itself and the other to provide positional reference for the mirror stepping mechanism using interference fringes of a stabilized 635 nm laser diode. Using interpolation of the laser interferogram and taking advantage of the translation stage precision in linear-piezo mode, the mechanism is capable of performing 79 nm steps, which puts the Nyquist wavelength at \u223c320 nm. The spectrometer was tested by measuring the spectra of HgAr cold-cathode fluorescent lamp and electron-induced fluorescence of ambient air. Two different detectors were used, an amplified photodiode detector and a photomultiplier tube module in photon counting mode.

{"title": "Inherent mechanism of frequency drift affected by constraint conditions for rotary piezoelectric motors.", "abstract": "The optimum drive frequency of rotary piezoelectric motors is in the vicinity of the resonance frequency of piezoelectric vibrators. Previous studies reveal that the resonance frequency is inconstant and is drifting with the variation of constraint conditions, of which the solutions generally focused on optimizing the drive circuits and control algorithms, while the working principle and equivalent modeling about frequency drift are still indistinct. By introducing the unknown parameters including stiffness coefficients and loss factors, the equivalent physical models and mathematical derivation are investigated. Based on the measured values of the impedance characteristics, the relationship between the piezoelectric parameters and the varying constrained boundaries is discussed. Then, the introduced parameters are identified and utilized as the input parameters for modifying the traditional finite element method. The numerical results agree well with the measured values and are compared with the traditional calculation, which reveals that the identified parameters and physical models are effective for illustrating the inherent mechanism of frequency drift. In addition, the mathematical equations and numerical simulation are both analyzed for the undamped and damped vibrating system, which demonstrates that the piezoelectric motor is a small damping vibration system and the effect of the loss factor on frequency calculation can be omitted.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2020-04-09", "authors": ["DaweiAn", "WeiqingHuang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5143635"}
{"title": "A fuzzy control for high-speed and low-overshoot hopping probe ion conductance microscopy.", "abstract": "At present, hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM) is the most capable ion conductance microscopy for imaging complex surface topography. However, the HPICM controller usually does not begin to stop the pipette sample approach until the ion current reaches a threshold, which results in short deceleration distances. Furthermore, closed-loop piezo actuation usually increases the response time. These problems tend to increase the ion current overshoot and affect imaging speed and quality. A fuzzy control system was developed to solve these problems via ion current deviation and deviation rate. This lengthens the deceleration distance to enable a high-speed approach toward the sample and smooth deceleration. Open-loop control of the piezo actuator is also used to increase sensitivity. To compensate for the nonlinearity of the actuator, a multi-section fuzzy logic strategy was used to maintain performance in all sections. Glass and poly(dimethylsiloxane) samples were used to demonstrate greater imaging speed and stability of the fuzzy controller relative to those of conventional controllers.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2020-04-09", "authors": ["JianZhuang", "LeiCheng", "XiaoboLiao", "Ali AkmalZia", "ZhiwuWang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5114642"}

This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of a high-precision two-degrees-of-freedom compliant mechanism to be used for lens XY micro-adjustment. The monolithic mechanism, which is based on a 1RR-2RRR configuration, uses flexure hinges to connect the movable inner ring with the fixed outer ring. The apparatus is driven using two piezoelectric actuators, and the lens terminal displacement is fed back in real time using two capacitive sensors. This paper describes the principle of the mechanism. Simulations and experiments are then performed to evaluate the system. The results show that the strokes along both the x-axis and the y-axis exceed \u00b125 \u00b5m. The accuracy of the proposed mechanism is better than \u00b17 nm. The root-mean-square induced figure error is better than 0.051 nm. The coupling z and tip/tilt rigid motions are less than 50 nm and 220 mas, respectively.

As a bridge between wearable electronics and their surrounding environment and users, sensors are core components of WIEs and determine the implementation of their many functions. Although the existing sensor technology has evolved to a very advanced level with the rapid progress of advanced materials and nanotechnology, most of them still need external power supply, like batteries, which could cause problems that are difficult to track, recycle, and miniaturize, as well as possible environmental pollution and health hazards. In the past decades, based upon piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric effect, various kinds of nanogenerators (NGs) were proposed which are capable of responding to a variety of mechanical movements, such as breeze, body drive, muscle stretch, sound/ultrasound, noise, mechanical vibration, and blood flow, and they had been widely used as self-powered sensors and micro-nanoenergy and blue energy harvesters.

In the test group all the procedures were performed using piezoelectric instruments and a specially designed piezoelectric lever, whereas in the control group conventional manual and rotary instruments were used. The main outcome measure was patient's pain perception, and the secondary outcome measures were complications, duration of the surgical treatment, and soft tissue healing. The study had a 1-week follow-up.\nFifty patients (23 females and 27 males) out of 90 were included in the study, and 100 third molars (50 maxillary and 50 mandibular) were extracted. All patients completed the expected follow-up. No differences were found between the two groups regarding patient's pain perception, complications, and soft tissue healing. However, the new piezoelectric extraction technique took less than half the time when compared to the conventional technique (4.6 \u00b1 4.5 minutes versus 10.2 \u00b1 13.1 minutes; P = .049).\nThe new piezoelectric third molar root extraction technique allowed third molar extraction in less than one half the surgical time required by the traditional technique. The advantages seem to be more pronounced in difficult cases. However, both surgeons who performed the procedures were very experienced and all the patients were young. Therefore, caution should be given to the generalization of the results. Multicenter studies with a larger variety of patients are needed to confirm the promising results of this study.", "journal": "Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)", "date": "2020-04-08", "authors": ["FontanellaFabrizio", "Maria GabriellaGrusovin", "MonicaGavatta", "TomasoVercellotti"], "doi": "10.3290/j.qi.a44370"}

This has been successfully tested in the crystallization of ionic salts, low molecular weight organic acids and proteins. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the crystal nucleation and growth of sodium chloride in contact with hydrophobic polymer surfaces at a supersaturated concentration of salt. A pristine polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) surface and PVDF containing different concentrations of graphene platelets were studied. Membrane crystallization tests were performed in parallel, in order to compare the experimental results with the computational ones. Here, with an integrated experimental-computational approach, we demonstrate that graphene-containing membranes assisted the crystal growth of NaCl, speeding up crystal nucleation in comparison with the pristine PVDF membranes. The computational results agreed with the experimental data, allowing the possibility of exploring the behavior of nanomaterials in membrane processes at a microscopic level.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2020-04-07", "authors": ["Maria LuisaPerrotta", "FrancescaMacedonio", "LidiettaGiorno", "WanqinJin", "EnricoDrioli", "AnnarosaGugliuzza", "ElenaTocci"], "doi": "10.1039/d0cp00928h"}

In this regard, three-dimensional printing (3D) technique needs bio-materials with higher mechanical and biological performance. The biomaterials with high mechanical performance beside its bio compatibility are limited. A novel bio-material made of Alginate, Hyaluronic acid, Halloysite Nanotube and Polyvinylidene Fluoride was used and characterized for printing cartilage bio scaffolds through numerical studies. CaCl2 was used for crosslinking of biomaterial. Scanning Electron Microscopy, mechanical tests (tensile and compressive test), MTT assay were conducted for evaluating this novel biomaterial. Different structures of bio material were simulated for numerical studies. The numerical study was performed in ANSYS 18 using three parameter Mooney-Rivlin model. According to experimental and numerical results, Halloysite Nanotube increases the tensile and compressive strength of biomaterial up to 47%. Results show that biomaterial have good mechanical performance due to mechanical forces required for cartilage bio scaffolds besides its high biological performance. Polyvinylidene fluoride reduces the mechanical performance while increasing the cell viability. MTT assay results performed on day 0, day 2 and day 6 show increase in cell number to be about twice for biomaterial containing 40\u00a0mg/ml alginate, 40\u00a0mg/ml halloysite nanotube, 10\u00a0mg/ml hyaluronic acid and 1 w/v Polyvinylidene fluoride.

The robot structure was a millimeter-sized rectangular glass plate with two piezoelectric patches attached, which allowed for traveling wave generation at a frequency between the resonant frequencies of two contiguous flexural modes. As a first goal, the location and size of the piezoelectric patches were calculated to maximize the structural displacement while preserving a standing wave ratio close to 1 (cancellation of wave reflections from the boundaries). The design guidelines were supported by an analytical 1D model of the structure and could be related to the second derivative of the modal shapes without the need to rely on more complex numerical simulations. Additionally, legs were bonded to the glass plate to facilitate the locomotion of the structure; these were fabricated using 3D stereolithography printing, with a range of lengths from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm. The optimal location of the legs was deduced from the profile of the traveling wave envelope.

{"title": "Research on Asymmetric Hysteresis Modeling and Compensation of Piezoelectric Actuators with PMPI Model.", "abstract": "Because of fast frequency response, high stiffness, and displacement resolution, the piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) are widely used in micro/nano driving field. However, the hysteresis nonlinearity behavior of the PEAs affects seriously the further improvement of manufacturing accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the modeling of asymmetric hysteresis behavior and compensation of PEAs. First, a polynomial-modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PMPI) model is proposed for the asymmetric hysteresis behavior. Compared with classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model, the PMPI model can be used to describe both symmetric and asymmetric hysteresis. Then, the congruency property of PMPI model is analyzed and verified. Next, based on the PMPI model, the inverse model (I-M) compensator is designed for hysteresis compensation. The stability of the I-M compensator is analyzed. Finally, the simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the accuracy of the PMPI model and the I-M compensator. The results implied that the PMPI model can effectively describe the asymmetric hysteresis, and the I-M compensator can well suppress the hysteresis characteristics of PEAs.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": ["WenWang", "JianWang", "ZhanfengChen", "RuijinWang", "KeqingLu", "ZhiqianSang", "BingfengJu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11040357\n10.1109/TCST.2007.903345\n10.1109/TRO.2017.2783937\n10.3390/mi5020289\n10.3390/mi6070879\n10.1109/TCST.2015.2441001\n10.1109/TIE.2011.2157287\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/2/025017\n10.1109/TMAG.2015.2487975\n10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022744\n10.1109/TMAG.2013.2288324\n10.1109/TMAG.2014.2329836\n10.1115/1.2907372\n10.1063/1.2052047\n10.1155/2014/932974\n10.3390/mi9050241\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.07.058\n10.1016/j.camwa.2011.12.015\n10.1016/j.jprocont.2012.02.007\n10.1109/TIE.2013.2258292\n10.3390/mi8040114\n10.1016/j.conengprac.2014.09.004\n10.3166/ejc.9.407-418\n10.1109/TIE.2013.2257153\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2007.04.006\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.029\n10.1109/TCST.2012.2200896"}
{"title": "Performance Enhancement of an Ultrasonic Power Transfer System Through a Tightly Coupled Solid Media Using a KLM Model.", "abstract": "Contactless ultrasonic power transmission (UPT) through a metal barrier has become an exciting field of research, as metal barriers prevent the use of electromagnetic wireless power transfer due to Faraday shielding effects. In this paper, we demonstrate power transfer through a metal wall with the use of ultrasonic waves generated from a piezoelectric transducer. Accurate characterization and modeling of the transducer and investigation of the influence of the acoustic properties of the transmitting medium are instrumental for the performance prediction and optimal design of an ultrasonic power link. In this work, we applied the KLM model for the emitting and receiving transducers, with respect to the transmitting medium and model for both the emission and reception function. A practical UPT system was built by mechanically coupling and co-axially aligning two composite transducers on opposite sides of a transmitting medium wall. The optimal transmission performance of the ultrasonic power link through thickness-stretch vibrations of the wall together with two piezoelectric transducers working in TE mode was determined. Eventually, the operating frequency and ohmic loading condition for maximum power transmission were obtained for two different media, aluminium and polyoxymethylene (POM), with contrasting specific acoustic impedances. The results showed that the measured optimal electric loads and operating frequency for maximum power transfer agreed well with the theoretical predictions.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-04-03", "authors": ["BibhuKar", "UlrikeWallrabe"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11040355\n10.3390/s151229870\n10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1214497\n10.1109/T-SU.1978.31001\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2839558\n10.1109/TSP.2014.2329276\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2373\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/12/123001\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa61ea\n10.1109/PROC.1969.7387\n10.1049/el:19700280\n10.1016/S0041-624X(03)00101-X\n10.1155/2019/7353129\n10.1109/58.265821\n10.1016/0041-624X(83)90033-1\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.04.019\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/12/125032\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1320834\n10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2175390\n10.1109/58.56492\n10.1023/A:1009962925948\n10.1121/1.2221557\n10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.02.002"}

Here, we propose a hierarchical nanotexturing of piezoelectric films as active microfluidic actuators, exploiting a unique combination of both topographical and chemical properties on flexible surfaces, while also introducing design concepts of shear hydrophobicity and tensile hydrophilicity. In doing so, we create nanostructured surfaces that are, at the same time, both slippery (low in-plane pinning) and sticky (high normal-to-plane liquid adhesion). By enabling fluid transportation on such arbitrarily shaped surfaces, we demonstrate efficient fluid motions on inclined, vertical, inverted, or even flexible geometries in three dimensions.

Since the phase-shifting amount of the introduced method herein is theoretical, regardless of the input wavelength, the simultaneous recording of step-wise phase-shifted interferograms for different color channels is available.

Although numerous chemical and biological agents have been recognized in regulating stem cells' fate, little is known about their potential to directly sense the mechanical signals to choose differentiation into a specific lineage. The success of any stem cell transplantation effort, however, hinges on thorough understanding of the fate of these cells under different signals, including mechanical cues. Various proteins are involved in the mechanical sensing process. Of these, Piezo proteins, as the ion channels activated by membrane tension and mechanical signals, play an important role in translating the information of mechanical forces such as rigidity and topography of the extracellular matrix to the intracellular signaling pathways related to stem cell homing and differentiation. They also play a key role in terms of shear stresses and tensile loads in expansion systems. This review highlights key evidence for the potential of mechanically gated ion channels expressed by human stem cells, and the mechanotransduction and past mechanomemory in the fate of transplanted stem cells.

Here, we developed an electric field-modulated SERS substrate based on the piezoelectric effect by combining the PVDF (piezoelectric-modulated layer) and Ag nanowires (AgNWs) (SERS active layer) and investigated the SERS activity in experiment and theory. The enhanced electric field and the tunable plasmon resonance induced by the piezoelectric effect provide the additional enhancement for the SERS signal. Furthermore, we fabricated a SERS active ring with a piezoelectric field-modulated substrate and achieved the in-situ detection of glucose with a non-invasive method. This work provided innovation for the E-SERS and could greatly promote the development of the in-situ, wearable and intelligent sensors.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-03-27", "authors": ["JiajunLu", "YuzhiSong", "FengcaiLei", "XuejianDu", "YanyanHuo", "ShicaiXu", "ChonghuiLi", "TingyinNing", "JingYu", "ChaoZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-62251-0\n10.1016/0009-2614(74)85388-1\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.4357\n10.1002/adma.201702893\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.11.080\n10.1515/nanoph-2017-0059\n10.1021/jacs.8b01501\n10.1364/OE.27.009879\n10.1038/lsa.2015.115\n10.1364/OE.26.021784\n10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03191\n10.1364/OE.26.021546\n10.1039/C8NR08389D\n10.1364/OE.23.024811\n10.1038/s41570-018-0031-9\n10.1002/smll.201805516\n10.1126/sciadv.aax0380\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120823\n10.1002/adfm.201701714\n10.1126/science.1258405\n10.1021/acsnano.5b01577\n10.1063/1.4921796\n10.1021/acsami.8b16989\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b03714\n10.1021/ja513263j\n10.1039/C7NR09276H\n10.1002/smll.201501627\n10.1002/adfm.201604226\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.022\n10.1002/anie.201610737\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.12.039\n10.1002/advs.201900925\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103959\n10.1021/jp5099975\n10.1088/0022-3727/40/22/043"}

Bromothymol Blue (BB), Tetrabromophenol Blue (TBB), Cresol Red (CR) and Brilliant Yellow (BY) in PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride)-supported OrMoSil (organically modified silicate) matrix, were used. Sensor preparation was reproducible. Signal was based on a suitably modified Hue coordinate from HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, H. Although H profile was not influenced by the indicator concentrations, the prediction error depended on the product of saturation and luminance, \u0394. By using H, the response of every spot was less affected by shape and optical inhomogeneity. The H calibration held for all the spots of the same lot and remained identical in time giving an advantage with respect to a glass electrode requiring calibration before each set of measurements. The prediction errors both in solution and in the OrMoSil matrix were similar: for BB, [Formula: see text] \u00a0=\u00a00.03 in both environments; for TBB, [Formula: see text] \u00a0=\u00a00.02 in the sensing spot and 0.05 in solution; for CR, [Formula: see text] \u00a0=\u00a00.11 in the sensing spot and 0.04 in solution; for BY, [Formula: see text] \u00a0=\u00a00.17 in the sensing spot and 0.07 in solution.

Widespread applications of electrospun PVDF as an energy conversion material, however, have not materialized due to the random arrangement of fibers fabricated by traditional electrospinning. In this work, a developed 3D electrospinning technique is utilized to fabricate a PVDF micro wall made up of densely stacked fibers in a fiber-by-fiber manner. Results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) demonstrate that the crystalline structure of this PVDF wall is predominant in the \u03b2 phase, revealing the advanced integration capability of structural fabrication and piezoelectric poling with this 3D electrospinning. The piezoelectric response along the radial direction of these PVDF fibers is measured while the toppled micro wall, comprised of 60 fibers, is sandwich assembled with a pair of top/bottom electrodes. The measured electrical output is ca. 0.48 V and 2.7 nA. Moreover, after constant mechanical compression happening over 10,000 times, no obvious reduction in the piezoelectric response has been observed.

Here, for the first time, we fabricated a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and formamidinium lead bromide nanoparticle (FAPbBr3 NP)-based composite aerogel film (FAPbBr3/PVDF) for harvesting electrical energy and photodetector applications. The uniform distribution of FAPbBr3 NPs in FAPbBr3/PVDF was achieved via the in situ synthesis of FAPbBr3 NPs in the PVDF matrix, which led to the stabilization of the \u03b3-phase. The freeze-drying process induced an interconnected porous architecture in the composite film, making it more sensitive to small mechanical stimuli. Owing to this unique fabrication technique, the constructed aerogel film-based nanogenerator (FPNG) exhibited an output voltage and current of \u223c26.2 V and \u223c2.1 \u03bcA, respectively, which were 5-fold higher than that of the nanogenerator with the pure PVDF film. Also, the sensitivity of FPNG upon the irradiation of light was demonstrated by the output voltage reduction of \u223c38%, indicating its capability as a light sensing device. Furthermore, the prepared FAPbBr3/PVDF composite was found to be an efficient candidate for light detection applications. A simple planar photodetector was fabricated with the 8.0 wt% FAPbBr3 NP-loaded PVDF composite, which displayed very high responsivity (8 A/W) and response speed of 2.6 s.

Our disposable devices can separate not only microparticles but also nanoparticles. Moreover, they can differentiate bacteria from human red blood cells (RBCs) with a purity of up to 96%.

{"title": "Piezoceramic-Based Damage Monitoring of Concrete Structure for Underwater Blasting.", "abstract": "This paper developed a piezoelectric-transducer-based damage detection of concrete materials after blasting. Two specimens (with or without an energy-relieving structure) were subjected to a 40 m deep-underwater blasting load in an underwater-explosion vessel, and their damage was detected by a multifunctional piezoelectric-signal-monitoring and -analysis system before and after the explosion. Statistical-data analysis of the piezoelectric signals revealed four zones: crushing, fracture, damage, and safe zones. The signal energy was analyzed and calculated by wavelet-packet analysis, and the blasting-damage index was obtained after the concrete specimen was subjected to the impact load of the underwater explosion. The damage of the two specimens gradually decreased from the blast hole to the bottom of the specimen. The damage index of the specimen with the energy-relieving structure differed for the fracture area and the damage area, and the damage protection of the energy-relieving structure was prominent at the bottom of the specimen.

{"title": "Non-Destructive Evaluation Device for Monitoring Fluid Viscosity.", "abstract": "There is an increasing need for non-destructive, low-cost devices for real-time fluid viscosity monitoring. Therefore, in this study, a method based on structural health monitoring is adapted for monitoring fluid properties. A device is built such that an inexpensive and disposable viscosity probe be possible. The design incorporates a sensor/actuator pair using a piezoelectric material layered with copper/brass and capable of monitoring viscosity changes in low volume liquids (e.g., vacutainer vial). Experiments performed with the new device show a definite pattern of wave propagation in viscous solutions. A numerical model is built to investigate the wave propagation in the fluid. For experimental measurements, the sensor part of the device detects the generated pressure wave in fluid (e.g., air, water, glycerin) by the actuator part. The phase shift between the actuator and the sensor signals is then recorded and plotted for different concentrations of glycerin and water at room temperature. The results of this study show a direct correlation between the phase shift and varying viscosity in the ultrasonic frequency range from 6 to 9 MHz. The numerical simulation, performed utilizing acoustic modal and harmonic response analysis, results also demonstrate the same trend as the experimental results: a phase shift increases with the viscosity of the fluid.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-03-21", "authors": ["AhmedAbdulkareem", "UgurErturun", "KarlaMossi"], "doi": "10.3390/s20061657\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.02.050\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2167716\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.02.025\n10.1016/j.triboint.2017.01.015\n10.1088/1742-6596/757/1/012020\n10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b01908\n10.1016/j.bpj.2015.11.3511\n10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.190\n10.3390/s16060830\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2562740\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.12.061\n10.1016/S0924-4247(98)00216-7\n10.1016/S0041-624X(00)00033-0\n10.3103/S106836661006005X\n10.1016/j.measurement.2016.09.019\n10.3390/s151127905\n10.1016/j.physb.2011.06.052\n10.1088/0957-0233/24/5/055105\n10.1007/s10765-006-0114-6\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.08.007\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.014\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2522648\n10.1080/00150193.2017.1362273\n10.1016/j.foodres.2019.108552\n10.1016/j.snb.2017.07.096\n10.1039/C5LC00661A\n10.3390/mi7090160\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.07.013\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/12/125007\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/009\n10.1016/j.compfluid.2006.08.007\n10.5402/2012/921361"}

The frequency spectra, describing the lateral size-dependence of mode couplings between the main mode (TE) and undesirable eigen-modes, for clamped lateral edges are compared with the existing frequency spectra for free lateral edges to illustrate the boundary influence. The displacement and stress variations in FBAR volume are also presented to intuitionally understand and distinguish the difference of frequency spectra between these two different lateral edges, and then we discuss how to select outstanding lateral sizes to weaken the mounting effect. The frequency spectra predicted from our approximate WBCs are also compared with and agree well with those predicted by the finite element method (FEM) using COMSOL, which proves the correctness and accuracy of our theoretical method.

{"title": "Graphene-Based Thermoacoustic Sound Source.", "abstract": "Thermoacoustic (TA) effect has been discovered for more than 130 years. However, limited by the material characteristics, the performance of a TA sound source could not be compared with magnetoelectric and piezoelectric loudspeakers. Recently, graphene, a two-dimensional material with the lowest heat capacity per unit area, was discovered to have a good TA performance. Compared with a traditional sound source, graphene TA sound sources (GTASSs) have many advantages, such as small volume, no diaphragm vibration, wide frequency range, high transparency, good flexibility, and high sound pressure level (SPL). Therefore, graphene has a great potential as a next-generation sound source. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can also be applied to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases using the photothermo-acoustic (PTA) effect. Therefore, in this review, we will introduce the history of TA devices. Then, the theory and simulation model of TA will be analyzed in detail. After that, we will talk about the graphene synthesis method. To improve the performance of GTASSs, many strategies such as lowering the thickness and using porous or suspended structures will be introduced. With a good PTA effect and large specific area, graphene PA imaging and drug delivery is a promising prospect in cancer treatment.

{"title": "Enhanced Electromagnetic Absorption Properties of Commercial Ni/MWCNTs Composites by Adjusting Dielectric Properties.", "abstract": "In this manuscript, we constructed a Ni/MWCNTs absorber and properly adjusted the permittivity resulted from absorber content in the PVDF to optimize impedance matching properties. Both \u03b5' and \u03b5\u2033 increase obviously with the increasing content of Ni/MWCNTs in PVDF, demonstrating that dielectric properties are dependent on the conductivity.

{"title": "Sonochemiluminescence Based on a Small, Cheap, and Low-Power USB Mesh-Type Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Transducer.", "abstract": "A small, cheap, and low-power mesh-type piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer (MPUT) from a household USB humidifier has been developed as a sonochemiluminescence generator for the first time. The ultrasonication of an MPUT facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species to trigger sonochemiluminescence. There is no light emission of luminol without sonication. In contrast, the luminescence becomes very intense by ultrasonication using the MPUT and can be readily observed by a smart phone, enabling the visual detection of luminol without adding any coreactants. Interestingly, ascorbic acid, a common chemiluminescence quencher in the literature, increases the sonochemiluminescence in this system. As a result, a sensitive sonochemiluminescence method has been developed for the visual detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 1-40 \u03bcM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.35 \u03bcM. Moreover, the visual detection of superoxide dismutase has been achieved on the basis of its quenching effect, which has a linear range of 0.05-2.0 \u03bcg/mL and a LOD of 0.018 \u03bcg/mL.

{"title": "Improvement of PVDF nanofiltration membrane potential, separation and anti-fouling performance by electret treatment.", "abstract": "Electret treatment was a simple method to enhance the charge-electrode properties of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) materials due to the increase of space charge and polarization charge of PVDF materials. The polarization charge was due to the electric dipole orientation change in loose nanofiltration PVDF membrane, which increased the electric dipole moment and improved the polarity of surface potential. Importantly, electret charges were less affected by ambient humidity. Therefore, the electret treatment could improve the surface negative potential of loose nanofiltration PVDF membrane, so as to improve its anti-fouling performance under certain conditions. Based on the above theoretical analysis, the influence and mechanism of the electret treatment on the surface potential, morphology, structure, hydrophilicity and anti-pollution performance of PVDF membrane were studied in this manuscript. When the electret time was 7.5\u00a0min and the electret voltage was 30\u00a0kV, the surface negative potential was the highest. The content of \u03b2 phase crystals was 39.1%, which was 12.18% higher than that of untreated membrane. In addition, the surface morphology of PVDF membrane did not change significantly, but the water contact angle decreased slightly, and the pore size increased by 0.36-0.75\u00a0nm. Importantly, the flux and the rejection of dye and BSA increased to some extent, and the maximum rejection rate and water flux were increased by 10.34% and 20.25%, respectively.

{"title": "Pulp vitality during ultrasonic tooth preparation. Part 2.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic devices have a lot of dental application specially in hygiene and surgery. However there are some disadvantages like cut slowness and heat production. Prosthodontics application is less investigated. In particular the heat production could be an important factor for the clinician. In fact more than 5.5 \u00b0C temperature increasing could determine pulp necrosis during tooth preparation. The aim of this study is to investigate the increasing of temperature during finishing line repositioning and polishing phases using ultrasounds inserts and to verify if it remains within the limit of 5.5 \u00b0C.\nA sample of 32 human molars (extracted for periodontal reasons) was selected. The teeth were endodontically treated and prepared with burs in order to obtain a prosthetic round chamfer preparation, leaving the apical portion pervious for inserting the thermocouple probe. Then, they were inserted in plaster cubes up to the cement-enamel junction. A wall has been selected for each tooth for margin repositioning and finishing and prepared with the piezoelectric instrument (Multipiezo Touch with TipHolder DB2, Mectron, Carasco, Genoa, Italy). A mechanical arm was used to standardize the operator-dependent parameters. These parameters were: the pressure exerted on the dental wall, the cutting length and the time required for margin repositioning and finishing. The test phase consisted in a first stage of margin repositioning using an regular ultrasound tip with a diamond grain of 120 micron (DB120, Mectron, Carasco, Italy) (group 1), followed by a second finishing step conducted by a extra fine ultrasound tip with a diamond grain of 60 micron (DB60, Mectron, Carasco, Italy) (group 2). Each test lasted 60 seconds: this was the time that the mechanical arm needed to accomplish 32 rides. During these stages the intrapulpal temperature has been recorded thanks to a thermocouple. The obtained temperature data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Withney post-hoc test, without Bonferroni correction (P<0.001).\nThe average pulpal temperature increase was 4.65 \u00b0C with a standard deviation of 0.99 \u00b0C for the DB 120 ultrasonic tip and 5.40 \u00b0C with a standard deviation of 0.84 \u00b0C for the DB 60 ultrasonic tip. However, neither of the instruments reach the medium critical level of 5.5\u00b0C reported in the literature, there are some single values who exceed it. There is statistically significant difference using tips with different granulometries within the two groups (P value =0.013).\nUltrasonic tools are very performing to achieve results in repositioning and polishing of prepared tooth.

The tomographic exam showed that bone tissue was at the level of the enamel-cementum junction, and gingival tissue covered a part of the anatomic crown. Virtual analysis using digital smile design (DSD) demonstrated that enlarging the clinical crowns would provide better aesthetics. The excess gingival tissue was removed from the gingival margin region with the aid of a mockup without interference to the interdental papillae. Then, osteotomy was performed using piezoelectric ultrasound until there was a 2.5\u2009mm distance from the top of the bone crest to the new gingival margin. In the postoperative period, good repositioning of the gingival margin, absence of postoperative complications, and rapid healing of the gingival tissue were verified.

{"title": "Proof-of-Concept for Gas-Entrapping Membranes Derived from Water-Loving SiO2/Si/SiO2 Wafers for Green Desalination.", "abstract": "Desalination through direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) exploits water-repellent membranes to robustly separate counterflowing streams of hot and salty seawater from cold and pure water, thus allowing only pure water vapor to pass through. To achieve this feat, commercial DCMD membranes are derived from or coated with water-repellent perfluorocarbons such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). However, the use of perfluorocarbons is limiting due to their high cost, non-biodegradability, and vulnerability to harsh operational conditions. Unveiled here is a new class of membranes referred to as gas-entrapping membranes (GEMs) that can robustly entrap air upon immersion in water. GEMs achieve this function by their microstructure rather than their chemical make-up. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept for GEMs using intrinsically wetting SiO2/Si/SiO2 wafers as the model system; the contact angle of water on SiO2 is \u03b8o \u2248 40\u00b0. Silica-GEMs had 300 \u03bcm-long cylindrical pores whose diameters at the (2 \u03bcm-long) inlet and outlet regions were significantly smaller; this geometrically discontinuous structure, with 90\u00b0 turns at the inlets and outlets, is known as the \"reentrant microtexture\". The microfabrication protocol for silica-GEMs entails designing, photolithography, chrome sputtering, and isotropic and anisotropic etching. Despite the water loving nature of silica, water does not intrude silica-GEMs on submersion. In fact, they robustly entrap air underwater and keep it intact even after six weeks (>10", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["RatulDas", "SankaraArunachalam", "ZainAhmad", "EdelbertoManalastas", "AhadSyed", "UlrichButtner", "HimanshuMishra"], "doi": "10.3791/60583"}

Evaluation was performed by an experienced surgeon, and a second relatively inexperienced surgeon.\nIrrespective of surgical experience, piezosurgery proved to be a safe method for exposure of the internal auditory canal. Compared with the conventional procedure it provides an improved surgical view and more precise bone removal in a narrow operating field. This novel technique has the characteristics to reduce the corresponding risk of accidental slipping with consequent thermal and mechanical injury to the dura and neurovascular structures. The major disadvantage of piezosurgery is the longer time required for bone removal.\nThe micro-oscillating piezoelectric device is a useful adjunct to the rotating burr during removal of the bone around the internal auditory canal in translabyrinthine approach. It could reduce the risk of injury to neurovascular structures at the bone-to-soft tissue interface.", "journal": "Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["StefanLyutenski", "MarcBloching"], "doi": "10.1097/MAO.0000000000002575"}
{"title": "Bio-Inspired Breastfeeding Simulator (BIBS): A Tool for Studying the Infant Feeding Mechanism.", "abstract": "This work introduces a bio-inspired breastfeeding simulator (BIBS), an experimental apparatus that mimics infant oral behavior and milk extraction, with the application of studying the breastfeeding mechanism in vitro.\nThe construction of the apparatus follows a clinical study by the authors that collects measurements of natural intra-oral vacuum, the pressure from infant's jaw, tongue and upper palate, as well as nipple deformation on the breast areola area. The infant feeding mechanism simulator consists of a self-programmed vacuum pump assembly simulating the infant's oral vacuum, two linear actuators mimicking the oral compressive forces, and a motor-driven gear representing the tongue motion. A flexible, transparent and tissue-like breast phantom with bifurcated milk duct structure is designed and developed to work as the lactating human breast model. Bifurcated ducts are connected with a four-outlet manifold under a reservoir filled with milk-mimicking liquid. Piezoelectric sensors and a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera are used to record and measure the in vitro dynamics of the apparatus.\nAll mechanisms are successfully coordinated to mimic the infant's feeding mechanism. Suckling frequency and pressure values on the breast phantom from the experimental apparatus are in good agreement with the clinical data. Also, the change in nipple deformation captured by BIBS matches with those from in vivo clinical ultrasound images.\nThe fully-developed breastfeeding simulator provides a powerful tool for understanding the bio-mechanics of breastfeeding and formulates a foundation for future breastfeeding device development.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["LinJiang", "FatemehHassanipour"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2020.2980545"}
{"title": "Quantitative assessment of compress-type osseointegrated prosthetic implants in human bone using electromechanical impedance spectroscopic methods.", "abstract": "Osseointegrated (OI) prostheses are a promising alternative to traditional socket prostheses. They can enhance the quality of life of amputees by avoiding fit and comfort issues commonly associated with sockets. The main structural element of the OI prosthesis is a biocompatible metallic implant that is surgically implanted into the bone of the residual limb. The implant is designed to provide a conducive surface for the host bone to osseointegrate with. The osseointegration process of the implant is difficult to clinically evaluate, leading to conservative postoperative rehabilitation approaches. Elastic stress waves generated in an OI prosthesis have been previously proposed to interrogate the implant-bone interface for quantitative assessment of the osseointegration process. This paper provides a detailed overview of the various elastic stress wave methods previously explored for in situ characterization of OI implants. Specifically, the paper explores the use of electromechanical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to assess the OI process in compress-type OI prostheses. The EIS approach measures the electrical impedance spectrum of lead zirconate titanate elements bonded to the free end of the implant. The research utilizes both numerical simulation and experimental verification to establish that the electromechanical impedance spectrum is sensitive (between 400 and 460\u00a0kHz) to both the degree and location of osseointegration. A baseline-free OI index is proposed to quantify the degree of osseointegration at the implant-bone interface and to assess the stability of the OI implant for clinical decision making.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering letters", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["WentaoWang", "Jerome PLynch"], "doi": "10.1007/s13534-019-00139-3\n10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2775100\n10.1007/s00113-017-0339-9\n10.1682/JRRD.2004.08.0134\n10.1302/0301-620X.96B1.31905\n10.1007/s10439-017-1976-4\n10.1007/s41669-017-0032-5\n10.1016/j.apmr.2013.05.020\n10.2106/JBJS.15.00808\n10.1177/0309364611409795\n10.1080/03093640308726667\n10.5435/00124635-200600001-00043\n10.1007/s11999-009-0946-z\n10.3390/s19030454\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2370945\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.08.016\n10.1177/1475921717732331\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2007.00397.x\n10.1007/s11012-013-9740-9\n10.1097/01.sap.0000189620.45708.5f\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.558.386\n10.1002/stc.1843\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.05.020\n10.1177/1475921718782399\n10.2514/3.9792\n10.1177/1045389X9700800406\n10.1177/1475921716655498\n10.1007/s00264-007-0392-z\n10.1016/j.bone.2006.06.001\n10.1016/j.bone.2009.04.249\n10.1002/stc.2171\n10.1002/mame.200800170\n10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.008"}

{"title": "Acoustic steering of active spherical carriers.", "abstract": "Following the novel introduced concept of the active carriers, this paper brings forward a technique toward the manipulability of an internally piezo-equipped active spherical carrier subjected to the progressive acoustic plane waves as the handling contactless asset. It is assumed that the piezoelectric part of the active carrier may be actuated as a bi-sectional body (i.e., two continuous hemispherical parts), with prescribed phase difference, and the polar position of the imaginary separating plane may be altered. This issue brings about an asymmetry in the dynamics of the problem which leads to emergence of position/frequency dependent acoustic radiation torque. It is obtained that as the carrier is excited by imposing harmonic voltage with the same amplitude and a \u03c0-radians phase difference, the zero-radiation force situation is obtained for a specific amplitude and phase of voltage as a function of frequency. This situation is treated as a criterion to determine the optimal amplitude of operation voltage. It is shown that the net force's direction exerted on the activated carrier may be steered along any desired orientation, assuming the fixed direction of incident wave field. The explained method of excitation and controllability of the spatial position of the divisor plane can possibly be a breakthrough in acoustic handling of active carriers. Noticeably, by this new technique, the single beam acoustic based contact-free methods and their applications in association with the concept of active carriers are now one step forward.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["MajidRajabi", "HosseinKhodavirdi", "AlirezaMojahed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106112"}

We validate the model experimentally for a basic design, where a microchannel is milled into the surface of an aluminum substrate, sealed with a PDMS cover, and driven at MHz frequencies by a piezoelectric lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) transducer. Both experimentally and numerically we find that the soft PDMS cover suppresses the Rayleigh streaming rolls in the bulk. However, due to the low transverse speed of sound in PDMS, such devices are prone to exhibit acoustic streaming vortices in the corners with a relatively large velocity.

Attempts to develop cost-effective ambulatory systems to measure REM sleep have had limited success. As elevated twitching is often observed during REM sleep in some distal muscles, the aim of this study was to assess the potential for a finger-mounted device to measure finger twitches, and thereby differentiate periods of REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep.\nOne night of sleep data was collected by polysomnography from each of 18 (3f, 15m) healthy adults aged 23.2 \u00b1 3.3 (mean \u00b1 SD) years. Finger movement was detected using a piezo-electric limb sensor taped to the index finger of each participant. Finger twitch densities were calculated for each stage of sleep.\nFinger twitch density was greater in REM than in NREM sleep (\nFinger twitching is more frequent in REM sleep than in NREM sleep and becomes more distinguishable as sleep progresses.

In this work, thermostable physically cross-linked polymer electrolytes, or thermostable physical ion gels, were successfully developed using crystallization-induced phase separation of semicrystalline polyamides (PAs) in an ionic liquid (IL). In these ion gels, phase-separated PA crystals act as network junctions and enable the ion gels to maintain their mechanical integrity up to 180 \u00b0C.

This research sets out the use of piezoelectric sensors for real-time monitoring of mechanical strength in metallic structures in the ongoing operational control of machinery components. The behaviour of aluminium and steel structures under flexural strength was studied using piezoelectric sensors. Variations in structural behaviour and geometry were measured, and the load and \u03bcstrains during operational conditions were quantified in the time domain at a specific frequency. The lead zirconium titanate (PZT) sensors were able to distinguish between material types and thicknesses. Moreover, this work covers frequency selection and optimisation from 20 Hz to 300 kHz.

{"title": "Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Unconstrained Sleep Stage Classification Using Polyvinylidene Fluoride Film Sensor.", "abstract": "Sleep stage scoring is the first step towards quantitative analysis of sleep using polysomnography (PSG) recordings. However, although PSG is a gold standard method for assessing sleep, it is obtrusive and difficult to apply for long-term sleep monitoring. Further, because human experts manually classify sleep stages, it is time-consuming and exhibits inter-rater variability. Therefore, this article proposes a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for automatic sleep stage scoring using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sensor that can provide unconstrained long-term physiological monitoring. Signals were recorded using a PVDF sensor during PSG. From 60 recordings, 30 were used for training, 10 for validation, and 20 for testing. Sixteen parameters, including movement, respiration-related, and heart rate variability, were extracted from the recorded signals and then normalized. From the selected LSTM architecture, four sleep stage classification performances were evaluated for a test dataset and the results were compared with those of conventional machine learning methods. According to epoch-by-epoch (30 s) analysis, the classification performance for the four sleep stages had an average accuracy of 73.9% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.55. When compared with other machine learning methods, the proposed method achieved the highest classification performance.

This support plays a crucial role in the process of cell proliferation and differentiation. Herein, three different nanofibrous scaffolds that are highly attractive for tissue engineering were selected and then osteogenic related genes and protein expression patterns of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) were investigated when grown on substrates. Polycaprolactone, Poly (L-lactic acid) and Polyvinylidene-fluoride nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated using Electrospinning method and then AT-MSCs viability and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated while cultured on them. The highest AT-MSCs survival rate when grown on the scaffolds was detected when grown on Polyvinylidene-fluoride. In addition, the highest ALP activity and mineralization were also observed in differentiated AT-MSCs has grown on Polyvinylidene-fluoride. The expression levels of Runx2, osteonectin and osteocalcin genes and osteocalcin protein in the AT-MSCs has grown on the Polyvinylidene-fluoride were also significantly higher than the rest of the scaffolds. Based on the results, it seems that since the studied substrate have a similar structural characteristics, their nature may have an important role in the stem cell's osteogenesis process, where the Polyvinylidene-fluoride piezoelectricity was a most distinguished characteristic.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2020-03-08", "authors": ["Mohammad FoadAbazari", "ZahrasadatHosseini", "ShohrehZare Karizi", "SaraNorouzi", "MojdehAmini Faskhoudi", "EhsanSaburi", "Seyed EhsanEnderami", "AbdolrezaArdeshirylajimi", "HassanMohajerani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2020.144534"}

{"title": "A Plug-and-Latch Mechanism for Gating the Mechanosensitive Piezo Channel.", "abstract": "The mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels convert mechanical force into cation permeation. However, their precise mechanogating and regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that Piezo1 utilizes three lateral ion-conducting portals equipped with physical gates for cooperative gating and splicing regulation. Mutating residues lining the portal converts Piezo1 into an anion-selective channel, demonstrating the portal-based cation-permeating pathway. Intriguingly, the portal is physically blocked with a plug domain, which undergoes alternative splicing in both Piezo1 and Piezo2. The Piezo1 isoform has local openings of the portals, enlarged single-channel conductance and sensitized mechanosensitivity. Remarkably, the three plugs are strategically latched onto the central axis for coordinated gating of the three portals. Disrupting the latching induces three quantal sub-conductance states in Piezo1, but not in the isoform. Together, we propose that Piezo utilizes an elegant plug-and-latch mechanism to physically and coordinately gate the lateral portals through the spliceable plug gates.", "journal": "Neuron", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["JieGeng", "WenhaoLiu", "HengZhou", "TingxinZhang", "LiWang", "MingminZhang", "YiranLi", "BoShen", "XuemingLi", "BailongXiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2020.02.010"}

Given that composite rocks are prone to shear failure, which cannot be accurately monitored, the piezoelectric active sensing method and wavelet packet analysis method were employed to conduct a shear failure monitoring test on composite rocks in this study. For the experiment, specimens were prepared for the simulation of the composite rocks using cement. Two pairs of piezoelectric smart aggregates (SAs) were embedded in the composite specimens. When the specimens were tested using the direct shear apparatus, an active sensing-based monitoring test was conducted using the embedded SAs. Moreover, a wavelet packet analysis was conducted to compute the energy of the monitoring signal; thus allowing for the determination of the shear damage index of the composite specimens and the quantitative characterization of the shear failure process.

Fundamentally, machines are based on the integration of materials with mechanisms to accomplish tasks-such as generating motion or lifting an object. An emerging research paradigm is the design, synthesis, and integration of responsive materials within or as machines. Herein, a particular focus is the integration of responsive materials to enable robotic (machine) functions such as gripping, lifting, or motility (walking, crawling, swimming, and flying). Key functional considerations of responsive materials in machine implementations are response time, cyclability (frequency and ruggedness), sizing, payload capacity, amenability to mechanical programming, performance in extreme environments, and autonomy. This review summarizes the material transformation mechanisms, mechanical design, and robotic integration of responsive materials including shape memory alloys (SMAs), piezoelectrics, dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), ionic electroactive polymers (IEAPs), pneumatics and hydraulics systems, shape memory polymers (SMPs), hydrogels, and liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and networks (LCNs).

{"title": "A Tactile Virtual Reality for the Study of Active Somatosensation.", "abstract": "Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants' detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.", "journal": "Frontiers in integrative neuroscience", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["ArindamBhattacharjee", "Diljit SinghKajal", "AlessandraPatrono", "YiwenLi Hegner", "MassimilianoZampini", "CorneliusSchwarz", "ChristophBraun"], "doi": "10.3389/fnint.2020.00005\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5228-04.2006\n10.1080/0899022031000083825\n10.1121/1.397184\n10.5271/sjweh.435\n10.1001/archpsyc.1990.01810140081011\n10.1109/tbme.2005.845147\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-14-05289.2001\n10.1139/y94-080\n10.1007/bf00249795\n10.1243/pime_proc_1969_184_074_02\n10.1177/155005940803900209\n10.1007/s00221-011-2632-0\n10.1006/nimg.1998.0395\n10.1007/s00125-007-0813-y\n10.1006/nimg.1998.0396\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-18-07416.2001\n10.1115/1.4006901\n10.1016/j.jht.2011.01.001\n10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00154-7\n10.1007/bf00401840\n10.1007/s10548-018-0649-4\n10.1093/cercor/bhz111\n10.1007/s004200050389\n10.1053/apmr.2002.28025\n10.1152/jn.00680.2013\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0693-19.2019\n10.3109/00207458709043338\n10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4\n10.1155/2011/156869\n10.1007/bf02423508\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.016\n10.1002/hbm.21091\n10.1016/0168-5597(92)90007-x\n10.1016/j.apmr.2007.09.007\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.100\n10.1152/jn.1991.65.3.531\n10.1121/1.1918868\n10.3109/08990220.2012.754754\n10.3109/08990220.2015.1091771"}
{"title": "Kinematic Parameters of Topspin Forehand in Table Tennis and Their Inter- and Intra-Individual Variability.", "abstract": "The aims of the research were to (1) determine the values of kinematic parameters in two modifications of the topspin forehand stroke as well as the differences between them and (2) assess the inter-individual and intra-individual variability of the values. Two modifications of a topspin forehand were evaluated: topspin after a topspin ball (TF1) and topspin after a backspin ball (TF2). The MyoMotion Noraxon analysis system was used to record the kinematic data. A piezo-electric sensor was used to identify the moment when the ball made contact with the racket. The coefficient of variation determined the variability of the kinematic parameters. Most of the joint angles in four identified events reflected how the individual segments of a player's body should move. The difference in acceleration at the moment of contact between the two types of the topspin forehand was significant, but the variability of the acceleration values was small. Large variability in the angular parameters was found, and this result was considered a manifestation of different coordination patterns in the stroke movements. It is possible that even though the players used different methods of performing the movement, they obtained similar values for some parameters (e.g., acceleration), which should be taken into account by coaches. There were small differences in many parameters within individual players, which can indicate that a player performs tasks in a similar way each time. However, there was high variability in some angular parameters, indicating that the repetitions of particular strokes were not performed in an identical way. The reasons for this phenomenon include movement functionality and functional variability.", "journal": "Journal of sports science & medicine", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["ZiemowitBa\u0144kosz", "S\u0142awomirWiniarski"], "doi": null}

The nonlinear magnetic model is acquired by using equivalent magnetizing current theory, and the nonlinear resilience model is obtained by fitting experimental data. The corresponding distributed parameter model based on generalized Hamiltonian variation principle has been established. Frequency response functions for the TPEH-C are derived according to harmonic balance expansion, and the influence of different magnet distances and different excitation accelerations on the response amplitude and bandwidth of the TPEH-C are investigated. More importantly, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by experiments. The results reveal that the spectrum of composite beam shows hard characteristic and the depth of potential well is changed, which provides a new way to ameliorate the potential well of the TPEH-C. A suitable magnet distance enables the TPEH-C to improve the response amplitude and the effective frequency range.

{"title": "Neural Modulation of the Primary Auditory Cortex by Intracortical Microstimulation with a Bio-Inspired Electronic System.", "abstract": "Nowadays, the majority of the progress in the development of implantable neuroprostheses has been achieved by improving the knowledge of brain functions so as to restore sensorial impairments. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is a widely used technique to investigate site-specific cortical responses to electrical stimuli. Herein, we investigated the neural modulation induced in the primary auditory cortex (A1) by an acousto-electric transduction of ultrasonic signals using a bio-inspired intracortical microstimulator. The developed electronic system emulates the transduction of ultrasound signals in the cochlea, providing bio-inspired electrical stimuli. Firstly, we identified the receptive fields in the primary auditory cortex devoted to encoding ultrasonic waves at different frequencies, mapping each area with neurophysiological patterns. Subsequently, the activity elicited by bio-inspired ICMS in the previously identified areas, bypassing the sense organ, was investigated. The observed evoked response by microstimulation resulted as highly specific to the stimuli, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural oscillatory activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma waves were related to the stimuli preferred by the neurons at the stimulated site. The alpha waves modulated cortical excitability only during the activation of the specific tonotopic neuronal populations, inhibiting neural responses in unrelated areas. Greater neuronal activity in the posterior area of A1 was observed in the beta band, whereas a gamma rhythm was induced in the anterior A1. The results evidence that the proposed bio-inspired acousto-electric ICMS triggers high-frequency oscillations, encoding information about the stimulation sites and involving a large-scale integration in the brain.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-03-07", "authors": ["Maria GiovannaBianco", "Salvatore AndreaPullano", "RitaCitraro", "EmilioRusso", "GiovambattistaDe Sarro", "Etiennede Villers Sidani", "Antonino SFiorillo"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering7010023\n10.1155/2018/1435030\n10.3389/fnins.2018.00843\n10.1152/physrev.00027.2016\n10.1016/j.heares.2015.01.006\n10.1038/nature10489\n10.1073/pnas.1221113110\n10.1038/10223\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3285-15.2016\n10.1016/j.cub.2015.02.063\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.01.006\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.05.019\n10.1152/jn.00483.2012\n10.1152/jn.00230.2013\n10.1037/a0012889\n10.1016/j.bbr.2011.08.040\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3227-06.2007\n10.1016/S0165-0270(99)00130-2\n10.1155/2017/2632178\n10.1038/srep12447\n10.1186/s12938-018-0454-z\n10.1109/TIM.2012.2188350\n10.1155/2011/156869\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.12.041\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77236-X\n10.1016/j.conb.2013.01.014\n10.1007/s002130100685\n10.1111/ejn.12478\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07568.x\n10.1038/srep35991\n10.1007/s00359-016-1099-7\n10.1038/srep29102\n10.1038/srep39226\n10.1002/cne.10412\n10.1016/j.neulet.2016.11.062\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00089\n10.3389/fnbot.2017.00004\n10.1038/nn.3213\n10.1073/pnas.0407332102\n10.1038/ncomms2379\n10.1016/j.heares.2015.02.008\n10.1073/pnas.97.14.8081\n10.1016/j.tics.2012.10.007\n10.1016/j.brainresrev.2006.06.003\n10.1073/pnas.120162397\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2397-15.2015\n10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00624.x\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07487.x\n10.1016/j.brainres.2007.10.081"}

The optomechanical approach with gigahertz-frequency mechanical devices has the potential to be extremely efficient due to the large optomechanical response of common materials, and the ability to localize mechanical energy into a micron-scale volume. However, existing demonstrations suffer from some combination of low optical quality factor, low electrical-to-mechanical transduction efficiency, and low optomechanical interaction rate.

Extensive study related to the architectural effects of compatibilizer on the compatibilization has mainly focused on the side chains. We investigated the influence of the compatibilizer-main-chain structure on the compatibilizing effect for immiscible poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(L-lactic acid) (PVDF/PLLA) blends. Two reactive-comb compatibilizers with polystyrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as main chains and PMMA as the side chains have been synthesized. PS is immiscible with both PLLA and PVDF, while PMMA is miscible with PVDF. It was found that both compatibilizers can improve the compatibility between the PLLA and PVDF, with different compatibilization effects.

Moreover, RC-SG induces a wider co-continuous interval range than RC-MMG. The co-continuous structure obtained by RC-SG was also more stable than that by RC-MMG.

Results showed that the \u03b2-phase PVDF FBARs had a resonant frequency round 9.212 with a high electromechanical coupling coefficient () of 12.76% \u00b1 0.56%. The device performed well over a wide bending-strain range up to 2400 owing to its excellent flexibility. It showed good stability as a strain sensor with a sensitivity of 80 , and no visible deterioration was observed after cyclic bending tests. The PVDF FBAR also exhibited an exceptionally large temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of -4630 , two orders of magnitude larger than those of other FBARs based on common inorganic piezoelectric materials, extraordinarily high sensitivity for temperature sensing. All results showed that -phase PVDF FBARs have the potential to expand the application scope for future flexible electronics.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-03-04", "authors": ["TingWu", "HaoJin", "ShurongDong", "WeipengXuan", "HongshengXu", "LeiheLu", "ZijingFang", "ShuyiHuang", "XiangTao", "LinShi", "ShutingLiu", "JikuiLuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s20051346\n10.1088/1361-6439/aab935\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2042711\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.07.052\n10.3390/s100504180\n10.1088/0960-1317/25/11/115005\n10.1038/srep09510\n10.1143/JJAP.8.975\n10.1080/10739140701255631\n10.1109/58.19169\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.03.023\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.002\n10.1039/c1ee02241e\n10.1049/ip-i-1.1983.0040\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.918749\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2004.12.040\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.10.025\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.04.006\n10.1108/02602280110388315\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065010\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/8/085030\n10.1080/03091900903067424\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2006.02.052\n10.1109/94.544185\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.06.023\n10.1557/PROC-0949-C03-02\n10.1039/C5CC01688F"}

The effects of stretching ratios and stretching rates on the crystallization behavior, morphology, and performance of the PVDF membranes were investigated. The results showed that the treatment resulted in generation of the \u03b2 crystalline phase PVDF and increased the crystallinity of the membrane materials. The treatment also brought about the orientation of the membrane pores along the stretching direction and led to an increase in the mean pore size of the membranes. In addition, as the stretching ratio increased, the tensile strength and permeation flux were improved while the elongation at break was depressed. However, compared to the stretching ratio, the stretching rate had less influence on the membrane structure and performance. In general, as the stretching ratio was 50% and the stretching rate was 20 mm/min, the tensile strength was increased by 36% to 7.47 MPa, and the pure water flux was as high as 776.28 L/(m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-03-04", "authors": ["YuanhuiTang", "YakaiLin", "HanhanLin", "ChunyuLi", "BoZhou", "XiaolinWang"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10030038\n10.1002/aic.15076\n10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136375\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1002/app.23137\n10.1016/j.jiec.2018.04.019\n10.1007/s10973-010-0961-z\n10.1002/app.38845\n10.1002/app.37574\n10.1002/app.46324\n10.1002/app.40077\n10.1177/8756087914564394\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.06.037\n10.1080/19443994.2015.1136692\n10.1002/app.30622\n10.1002/app.32696\n10.1002/pat.4449\n10.1016/j.memsci.2006.02.027\n10.1007/s10934-006-5491-5\n10.1007/s13233-015-3087-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.02.050\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.028\n10.1002/pol.1973.180111107\n10.1021/acs.iecr.9b02480\n10.1002/app.32218\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0126(199611)41:3<323::AID-PI617>3.0.CO;2-A\n10.1007/s00396-012-2820-x\n10.1002/polb.22097"}
{"title": "Advances in Sonothrombolysis Techniques Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "One of the great advancements in the applications of piezoelectric materials is the application for therapeutic medical ultrasound for sonothrombolysis. Sonothrombolysis is a promising ultrasound based technique to treat blood clots compared to conventional thrombolytic treatments or mechanical thrombectomy.

Because of the variety of clinical symptoms seen in the symptomatic cases, leptospirosis at its onset is often misdiagnosed as aseptic meningitis, influenza, hepatic disease or fever (pyrexia) of unknown origin. The disease has been widely spread, ranging from subclinical infection to a severe syndrome of multiorgan infection with high mortality. It is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, such as rice and sugar-cane field workers, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy workers, and military personnel. Various diagnostic methods have been developed for the diagnosis of leptospirosis that includes direct examination; serology and molecular based techniques, but have various shortcomings, so there is a need to develop an effective surveillance system to monitor the trends of disease to control this life-threatening zoonosis. Now a day's biosensor based technology becomes an excellent platform in the field of diagnostics due to their better sensitivity and specificity. So different types of biosensors such as enzyme-based, tissue-based, immunosensor, DNA biosensors, thermal and piezoelectric biosensors have been discussed here to highlight their indispensable applications in different fields.

To solve this problem, this paper proposed a damage monitoring method based on a sector piezoelectric sensor array for multiple signal classification algorithm. By arranging two sector piezoelectric sensor arrays that are suitable for a specific structure, the damage scattering array signal under the multi-excitation source was obtained and synthesized, the signal-to-noise ratios were improved, and the damage location accuracy was thus improved.

Most of the research reported in the literature has been focused on the preparation of poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) ENMs by using N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent, which is considered a mutagenic and cancerogenic substance. Hence, the possibility of using alternative solvents represents an interesting approach to investigate. In this work, we explored the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a low toxicity solvent in a mixture with acetone for the preparation of PVDF-ENMs. As a first step, a solubility study of the polymer, PVDF 6012 Solef\u00ae, in several DMSO/acetone mixtures was carried out, and then, different operating conditions (e.g., applied voltage and needle to collector plate distance) for the successful electrospinning of the ENMs were evaluated. The study provided evidence of the crucial role of solution conductivity in the electrospinning phase and the thermal post-treatment. The prepared ENMs were characterized by evaluating the morphology (by SEM), pore-size, porosity, surface properties, and performance in terms of water permeability. The obtained results showed the possibility of producing ENMs in a more sustainable way, with a pore size in the range of 0.2-0.8 \u00b5m, high porosity (above 80%), and water flux in the range of 11.000-38.000 L/m", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2020-03-01", "authors": ["FrancescaRusso", "ClaudiaUrsino", "ElisaAvruscio", "GiovanniDesiderio", "AndreaPerrone", "SergioSantoro", "FrancescoGaliano", "AlbertoFigoli"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes10030036\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.10.003\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2015.11.015\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2010.01.004\n10.1002/mame.201800336\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.07.044\n10.1016/j.jes.2018.04.002\n10.1016/j.desal.2019.114246\n10.1021/ie101928r\n10.1007/s11356-018-3575-9\n10.1039/C4GC00613E\n10.1002/app.46494\n10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.005\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.01.033\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b01407\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2006.05.008\n10.1002/app.46419\n10.1016/j.seppur.2017.04.040\n10.3934/matersci.2018.2.190\n10.1177/1528083718825315\n10.1039/C6RA15017A\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00592\n10.1002/pat.3220\n10.3390/nano9010052\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.023\n10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.056\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.074\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.03.062\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.001\n10.3390/molecules24030638\n10.1016/S0032-3861(00)00250-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.068\n10.1016/j.aej.2016.04.025\n10.1002/macp.200400225\n10.1007/s12221-009-0177-7\n10.1002/app.25498\n10.1080/19443994.2013.765364\n10.1016/j.polymer.2004.03.006\n10.1016/j.mssp.2017.06.047\n10.1002/app.21762\n10.1146/annurev.matsci.36.011205.123537\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06496\n10.1021/ma300656u\n10.1021/bm800476u\n10.3390/membranes8030071\n10.1002/ghg.1853\n10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.061\n10.1039/C0NR00730G\n10.1002/pen.21039\n10.1504/IJNM.2012.048577\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2014.12.015\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.050"}

Here, an innovative IR self-powered principle is reported that outstanding piezoelectric effect of poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanofibers (PVDF NFs) is driven by microcrystals' volume expansion caused by the solid-solid phase transition of PVDF/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/highly elastic phase change polymer (HEPCP) (PMH) nanocomposites due to MWCNT's excellent IR photoabsorption and thermal conversion capabilities. A flexible IR-sensitive nanocomposite is successfully developed employing PVDF/HEPCP NFs as the framework of a three-dimensional network structure wrapped by the MWCNT/HEPCP nanocomposite.

How do locomotor muscle metabo- and mechanoreceptor expression compare in heart failure patients and controls? Do relationships exist between the protein expression and cardiopulmonary responses during exercise with locomotor muscle neural afferent feedback inhibition? What is the main finding and its importance? Heart failure patients exhibited greater protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 and cyclooxygenase-2 than controls. These findings are important as they identify receptors that may underlie the augmented locomotor muscle neural afferent feedback in heart failure.\nHeart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) exhibit abnormal locomotor group III/IV afferent feedback during exercise; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine (1) metabo- and mechanoreceptor expression in HFrEF and controls and (2) relationships between receptor expression and changes in cardiopulmonary responses with afferent inhibition. Ten controls and six HFrEF performed 5\u00a0min of cycling exercise at 65% peak workload with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl (FENT) or placebo (PLA).

{"title": "Enhanced piezoelectric and acoustic performances of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) films for hydroacoustic applications.", "abstract": "Concerning the study of flexible piezoelectric devices, both scholars and engineers propose that poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) shows more merits than oriented polyvinylidene fluoride (OPVDF) in terms of dielectric, piezoelectric, mechanic-electric, acoustic emission reception performances, etc. Thus, in this study, to clarify the differences between the two types of polymers on their ferroelectric and piezoelectric behaviors, we systematically investigated samples to analyze their molecular structures and phase structures, and to compare their dielectric properties and acoustic emission reception performances. It was found that the wedge effect of TrFE, P(VDF-TrFE), possesses higher regular \u03b2 phase crystal grains, which are easier to order along the electric field and possess more ordered static charge distribution than that of OPVDF. Consequently, a considerable saturated electric polarization (Pm \u223c 15 \u03bcC cm-2 under 225 MV m-1), a large piezoelectric coefficient (d33 \u223c -21.5 pC N-1) and a low coercive electric field (Ec \u223c 50 MV m-1) were obtained in the P(VDF-TrFE) films. It is worth noting that P(VDF-TrFE) shows a more stable d33 piezoelectric response (up to 120 \u00b0C) than that of the OPVDF. Additionally, the P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric films exhibit a sensitive acoustic emission reception property at approximately 70 dB and an extensive response frequency range from 10 to 100 kHz. These combined properties demonstrate that P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric films are a promising material for flexible and easily shaped electronic devices, including hydroacoustic sensors, actuators, and energy transfer units.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2020-02-28", "authors": ["ZhenjiZhou", "JingleiLi", "WeiminXia", "XuanZhu", "TaoSun", "CongjunCao", "LinZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c9cp06553a"}

Subsequently, the copulatory behaviors were record by a video camera six times, once a week. The last three mating processes of 134 male rats were successfully recorded. The males were divided into three groups according to ejaculation frequency value. Immunocytochemical and molecular methods as well as whole-cell patch clamp recording were used to show the difference between premature ejaculation rats and control rats.

Whole-cell patch clamp recording demonstrated that mechanical stimulation evoked a higher inward current density in premature ejaculation rats compared with control rats, which could be inhibited by the PIEZO2-specific antagonist, FM1-43. PIEZO2 knockdown experiments revealed that the inward current density induced by mechanical stimulation was significantly decreased in PIEZO2 knockdown rats, and that the mount frequency and ejaculation latency and frequency were significantly improved in PIEZO2 knockdown rats.\nOur data demonstrate PIEZO2 involvement in peripheral nerve sensitization, indicating that pharmacological antagonism of PIEZO2 may be a useful strategy for treating premature ejaculation.", "journal": "Andrology", "date": "2020-02-27", "authors": ["ZhenghaoChen", "MingzhenYuan", "ZhenMa", "JiliangWen", "XueshengWang", "MengmengZhao", "JiaxinLiu", "XiulinZhang", "ShengtianZhao", "LiqiangGuo"], "doi": "10.1111/andr.12779"}

The theoretical model of the piezoelectric energy harvester is developed to explain the dynamics of the system and experiments are conducted to validate the model.

{"title": "Diurnal Cycle of Translaminar Pressure in Nonhuman Primates Quantified With Continuous Wireless Telemetry.", "abstract": "Recent retrospective clinical studies and animal experiments have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) is important in glaucoma pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and CSFP are the driving components of the translaminar pressure (TLP), which directly effects the optic nerve head. This study measured the diurnal cycle of TLP using continuous wireless telemetry in nonhuman primates (NHPs), a common animal model of glaucoma.\nWe have developed an implantable wireless telemetry system based on a small piezoelectric pressure transducer with low drift. Unilateral IOP was measured in the anterior chamber of the eye, and intracranial pressure (ICP, a surrogate measure of CSFP) was measured in the brain parenchyma in four awake, behaving NHPs for periods of 22 to 281 days. IOP and ICP telemetry transducers were calibrated with direct pressure measurements in the eye (every 2 weeks) and brain (monthly). TLP was quantified in real time as IOP-ICP, and hourly means of IOP, ICP, and TLP were analyzed.\nResults show that mean ICP is significantly higher by an average of 4.8 \u00b1 0.8 mmHg during sleeping hours in NHPs (P < 0.01). IOP showed a small but significant nocturnal elevation in two of four animals despite NHPs sleeping upright (P < 0.05). TLP was significantly lower during sleep (7.1 \u00b1 0.6 mmHg; P < 0.01) than when the animals were awake and active (11.0 \u00b1 0.9 mmHg), driven primarily by the large increase in ICP during sleep.\nThe 56% increase in TLP during waking hours in NHPs matches the increase in TLP due to postural change from supine to upright reported previously in humans.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2020-02-26", "authors": ["Jessica VJasien", "Brian CSamuels", "James MJohnston", "J CrawfordDowns"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.61.2.37\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2004.06.001\n10.1097/ICU.0000000000000354\n10.1097/ICU.0b013e32833651d8\n10.1097/IJG.0b013e31815c5f7c\n10.1167/iovs.19-26600\n10.1167/iovs.15-17848\n10.1016/j.exer.2015.08.014\n10.1016/j.exer.2014.12.006\n10.1152/physiol.00051.2015\n10.1016/j.exer.2010.09.002\n10.1038/eye.2016.168\n10.1016/j.ajo.2015.05.034\n10.1097/ICU.0b013e32831eef82\n10.1167/iovs.14-14029\n10.1167/iovs.14-14894\n10.1007/s10237-013-0517-9\n10.1167/iovs.11-8009\n10.1167/iovs.10-6927\n10.1167/iovs.19-27060\n10.1016/j.exer.2015.02.011\n10.1167/iovs.17-22488\n10.1167/iovs.16-21393\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.01.013\n10.1007/s00417-009-1110-x\n10.1167/iovs.08-2228\n10.1016/j.mehy.2012.08.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052664\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2009.06.058\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2018.08.025\n10.1080/02713683.2019.1629594\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2011-300663\n10.1167/iovs.10-5542\n10.1002/ana.24713\n10.1016/j.brainres.2016.01.011\n10.1007/s11910-018-0831-9\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-306705"}

With regard to sensitivity, the output response shows nonlinearity depending on the frequency magnitude of the stimulus. We demonstrate a self-powered proton-driven solid-state somatosensor, which mimics a unique nonlinear response and intensity behavior of human mechanoreceptors. For this, a solid-state sensor is fabricated by combining a piezoelectric film and a proton generation device. The proton injection electrode and the Nafion layer conjugated with sulfonated graphene oxide are used for proton generation and transport. Two types of nonlinear signals from the sensor are similar to the Merkel/Ruffini (low deviation of threshold intensity), and in contrast, the behavior of Pacinian/Meissner (high deviation of threshold intensity) is simultaneously shown. The region of the most responsive frequency is also discriminated according to proton conduction.

The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which can transfer mechanical energy from the surrounding environment into electricity, has been recognized as the most promising alternative technology to remedy the shortcomings of traditional battery technology. Environmental mechanical energy widely exists in activities in nature and these environmental energy sources can enable TENGs to achieve a clean and distributed energy network, which can finally benefit the innovation of various wireless devices. In this review, TENGs targeting different environmental energy sources have been systematically summarized and analyzed. Firstly, we give a brief introduction to the basic principle and working modes of the TENG. Then, TENGs targeting different energy sources, from blowing wind and raindrops to pounding waves, noise signalling, and so on, are summarized based on their design concept and output performance. In addition, combined with other energy technologies such as solar cells, electromagnetic generators, and piezoelectric nanogenerators, the application of hybrid nanogenerators is elaborated under different scenarios.

The ability to define the morphology and structure of the nanorods is essential to maximizing the performance of optical and electrical devices such as piezoelectric nanogenerators; however, well-defined Schottky contacts to the polar facets of the structures have yet to be explored. In this work, we demonstrate a process to fabricate metal-semiconductor-metal device structures from vertical arrays with Au contacts on the uppermost polar facets of the nanorods and show that the O-polar nanorods (\u223c0.44 eV) have a greater effective barrier height than the Zn-polar nanorods (\u223c0.37 eV). Oxygen plasma treatment is shown by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to affect midgap defects associated with radiative emissions, which improves the Schottky contacts from weakly rectifying to strongly rectifying. Interestingly, the plasma treatment is shown to have a much greater effect in reducing the number of carriers in O-polar nanorods through quenching of the donor-type substitutional hydrogen on oxygen sites (H", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-02-25", "authors": ["Alex MLord", "VincentConsonni", "ThomasCossuet", "FabriceDonatini", "Steve PWilks"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b23260"}

It was found that, in addition to the membrane material's own characteristics, the structural vulnerability of the membranes had a determining effect on fouling development. The PVDF membrane showed the highest transmembrane pressure during MBR operation and its surface experienced significant damage because of the shearing stress caused by aeration, resulting in the penetration of the membrane by the fouling compounds.

However, a few studies have been conducted in the more clinically relevant megahertz range. To understand the piezoelectricity in bone, we fabricated ultrasound transducers using bone samples as piezoelectric materials and identified the longitudinal ultrasound radiation and reception in the megahertz range. The maximum transmitting sensitivity of the bone transducer was 140 mPa/V, which was nearly 1/1000 of a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transducer that has better electrical properties and piezoelectricity. The resonance frequencies of the transducer depend on the plate thickness and angle between the bone axis (alignment direction of the hydroxyapatite crystallites) and ultrasound propagation direction, reflecting the anisotropic character of the bone. The reception and transmission sensitivities of the bone transducers also depend on the plate thickness and angle, showing maximum values at off-axis angles.

Zebrafish embryo is used as the validation object, wherein a cell micropuncture experiment is successfully performed.

{"title": "GHz Ultrasonic Chip-Scale Device Induces Ion Channel Stimulation in Human Neural Cells.", "abstract": "Emergent trends in the device development for neural prosthetics have focused on establishing stimulus localization, improving longevity through immune compatibility, reducing energy re-quirements, and embedding active control in the devices. Ultrasound stimulation can single-handedly address several of these challenges. Ultrasonic stimulus of neurons has been studied extensively from 100\u2009kHz to 10\u2009MHz, with high penetration but less localization. In this paper, a chip-scale device consisting of piezoelectric Aluminum Nitride ultrasonic transducers was engineered to deliver gigahertz (GHz) ultrasonic stimulus to the human neural cells. These devices provide a path towards complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integration towards fully controllable neural devices. At GHz frequencies, ultrasonic wavelengths in water are a few microns and have an absorption depth of 10-20\u2009\u00b5m. This confinement of energy can be used to control stimulation volume within a single neuron. This paper is the first proof-of-concept study to demonstrate that GHz ultrasound can stimulate neurons in vitro. By utilizing optical calcium imaging, which records calcium ion flux indicating occurrence of an action potential, this paper demonstrates that an application of a nontoxic dosage of GHz ultrasonic waves [Formula: see text] caused an average normalized fluorescence intensity recordings >1.40 for the calcium transients. Electrical effects due to chip-scale ultrasound delivery was discounted as the sole mechanism in stimulation, with effects tested at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.01 statistical significance amongst all intensities and con-trol groups. Ionic transients recorded optically were confirmed to be mediated by ion channels and experimental data suggests an insignificant thermal contributions to stimulation, with a predicted increase of 0.03 ", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-02-23", "authors": ["Priya SBalasubramanian", "AnkurSingh", "ChrisXu", "AmitLal"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-58133-0\n10.1038/nprot.2011.371\n10.1088/1741-2560/13/3/031003\n10.1038/nn.3427\n10.1177/1073858409348066\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2107553\n10.1109/TNSRE.2003.810559\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.047\n10.1038/srep35806\n10.3389/fnins.2019.00208\n10.1088/1741-2560/6/5/056003\n10.1016/S0006-8993(03)03023-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.009\n10.1007/s10529-013-1313-4\n10.1016/j.brs.2011.03.007\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.08.1816\n10.1038/srep24170\n10.7863/jum.2010.29.6.963\n10.1016/j.pacs.2016.01.001\n10.1016/0041-624X(93)90070-G\n10.1016/j.canlet.2005.10.032\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00700-7\n10.1021/acsnano.5b03162\n10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77769-0\n10.1093/bja/52.3.325\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.04.015\n10.1063/1.3598340\n10.1152/jn.1998.79.2.648\n10.1016/0014-5793(89)80497-1\n10.1039/c2lc40612h\n10.1016/j.ceca.2015.10.003\n10.1016/j.neuro.2008.11.001\n10.1083/jcb.94.2.253\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.06-07-01934.1986\n10.1073/pnas.97.2.901\n10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01231-6\n10.1002/jnr.490240226\n10.1085/jgp.99.4.491\n10.1007/s10404-014-1380-4\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0071\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.12.003\n10.1186/1471-2202-4-15\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.040\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1677-11.2011\n10.1080/00401706.1978.10489648\n10.2217/nnm.12.63\n10.1016/S0301-5629(98)00014-3\n10.1016/0006-8993(91)90711-4\n10.1016/0301-5629(96)83782-3\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.09.005\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00700-7\n10.7863/jum.2010.29.6.963\n10.1016/j.canlet.2005.10.032\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.05.002\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.12.020\n10.1063/1.4757344\n10.1002/ima.22080\n10.1016/0887-2333(91)90072-L\n10.1007/s11095-017-2328-7\n10.1038/s41467-017-01031-3\n10.1364/OE.27.032228\n10.1038/nmeth.3217\n10.1049/el.2015.3450\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.10.020\n10.1109/10.102812\n10.2147/JIR.S163248\n10.1063/1.3573484"}

{"title": "Nonlinear dynamic stability of piezoelectric thermoelastic electromechanical resonators.", "abstract": "This research work\u00a0deals with analyzing instability and nonlinear behaviors of piezoelectric thermal nano-bridges. An adjustable thermo-elastic model with the ability to control stability conditions is developed to examine the system behavior at different temperatures. To increase the performance range and improve system characteristics, a piezovoltage is applied and a spring is connected to the sliding end of the deformable beam as design parameters. The partial differential equations (PDEs) are derived using the extended Hamilton's principle and Galerkin decomposition is implemented to discretize the nonlinear equations, which are solved via a computational method called the step-by-step linearization method (SSLM). To improve the accuracy of the solution, the number of mode shapes and the size of voltage increments are analyzed and sufficient values are employed in the solution. The validity of the formulation and solution method is verified with experimental, analytical, and numerical data for several cases.

In order to enhance the reliability and safety of the robot, it is of great necessity to investigate the friction and wear mechanisms of the flexible cable. In this research, the friction and wear mechanisms have been discussed. The effects of relative speed, ambient temperature, and positive pressure on the flexible cables are considered by an orthogonal frictional movement. The cable friction force has been measured by a piezoelectric sensor with high natural frequency characteristics. The relations among friction and different factors affecting friction have also been discussed. The results show that the relative speed and the ambient temperature are the main factors affecting the friction and wear of the cable; the main form of flexible cable wear is mechanical-force chemical friction and wear.

{"title": "Adaptive signal decomposition and dispersion removal based on the matching pursuit algorithm using dispersion-based dictionary for enhancing damage imaging.", "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a method for high-resolution damage imaging for a sparsely distributed sensor network on a plate-like structure. Techniques for dispersion removal and signal decomposition are indispensable to accurate damage localization. By combining the dispersion-removed wave packets with the damage-imaging algorithm, a point-like damage can be precisely localized. In this article, a matching pursuit algorithm was utilized to decompose overlapping wave packets and then recompress the dispersion. The matching pursuit dictionary was constructed based on an asymptotic solution of the dispersion relation for Lamb waves in toneburst wave packets. The dispersion-based Hanning-window dictionary provided the parametric information for the extracted wave packets, such as propagation time-delay, dispersion extent, and phase. The parameters were leveraged for the dispersion-removal algorithm. Results of the simulation indicate that the proposed algorithm is capable of recompressing multiple dispersive wave packets with the different modes. Finally, the proposed approach was validated by the results of the experiment using a sparse array of piezoelectric wafers on an aluminum plate. Extracting the parameters of individual wave packets and removing the dispersion through matching pursuit, the algorithm for minimum-variance imaging produced a high-quality image with a fine spatial resolution. The image artifacts were significantly suppressed, and the accuracy was improved by 62.1% compared to conventional minimum-variance imaging.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-02-15", "authors": ["HowukKim", "Fuh-GwoYuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106087"}
{"title": "Nucleic acid amplification free biosensors for pathogen detection.", "abstract": "Efficient and rapid detection of pathogens plays an important role in food safety, disease prevention, diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The traditional method for pathogen detection is plate culturing, consuming lots of time on separating, culturing and identifying pathogens by morphological characteristics, biochemical and serological reactions. It is a great advantage to take nucleic acids of pathogens as targets for detection because of higher specificity. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) greatly shortens the time of pathogen detection but it is heavily dependent on temperature control instruments. Although isothermal amplification overcomes the defects of temperature control, it requires multiple enzymes or complex primers. Here, we summarize the recent advances in the amplification free methods for pathogen detection which are well developed for their simplicity, sensitivity and rapidity. Without nucleic acid amplification, we can directly detect the original nucleic acids of the samples rather than amplified nucleic acids. The amplification free methods for nucleic acid detection are mainly classified into electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors and piezoelectric plate biosensors. This article describes the principles and compares the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.

{"title": "A Systematic Approach to the Design and Characterization of A Smart Insole for Detecting Vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) in Gait Analysis.", "abstract": "Gait analysis is a systematic study of human locomotion, which can be utilized in variousapplications, such as rehabilitation, clinical diagnostics and sports activities. The various limitationssuch as cost, non-portability, long setup time, post-processing time etc., of the current gait analysistechniques have made them unfeasible for individual use. This led to an increase in research interestin developing smart insoles where wearable sensors can be employed to detect vertical groundreaction forces (vGRF) and other gait variables. Smart insoles are flexible, portable and comfortablefor gait analysis, and can monitor plantar pressure frequently through embedded sensors thatconvert the applied pressure to an electrical signal that can be displayed and analyzed further.Several research teams are still working to improve the insoles' features such as size, sensitivity ofinsoles sensors, durability, and the intelligence of insoles to monitor and control subjects' gait bydetecting various complications providing recommendation to enhance walking performance. Eventhough systematic sensor calibration approaches have been followed by different teams to calibrateinsoles' sensor, expensive calibration devices were used for calibration such as universal testingmachines or infrared motion capture cameras equipped in motion analysis labs. This paper providesa systematic design and characterization procedure for three different pressure sensors: forcesensitiveresistors (FSRs), ceramic piezoelectric sensors, and flexible piezoelectric sensors that canbe used for detecting vGRF using a smart insole. A simple calibration method based on a load cellis presented as an alternative to the expensive calibration techniques. In addition, to evaluate theperformance of the different sensors as a component for the smart insole, the acquired vGRF fromdifferent insoles were used to compare them. The results showed that the FSR is the most effectivesensor among the three sensors for smart insole applications, whereas the piezoelectric sensors canbe utilized in detecting the start and end of the gait cycle.

{"title": "Dynamic Modelling and Experimental Characterization of a Self-Powered Structural Health-Monitoring System with MFC Piezoelectric Patches.", "abstract": "The paper deals with theoretical and experimental studies for the development of a self-powered structural health monitoring (SHM) system using macro-fiber composite (MFC) patches. The basic idea is to integrate the actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting capabilities of the MFC patches in a SHM system operating in different regimes. As an example, during flight, under the effects of normal structural vibrations, the patches can work as energy harvesters by maintaining or restoring the battery charge of the stand-by SHM electronic board; on the other hand, if relevant/abnormal loadings are applied, or if local faults produce a noticeable stiffness variation of the monitored component, the patches can act as sensors for the power-up SHM board. During maintenance, the patches can then work as actuators, to stress the structure with pre-defined load profiles, as well as sensors, to monitor the structural response. In this paper, the investigation, based on the electromechanical impedance technique, is carried out on a system prototype made of a cantilevered composite laminate with six MFC patches. A high-fidelity nonlinear model of the system, including the piezoelectric hysteresis of the patches and three vibration modes of the laminate beam, is presented and validated with experiments. The results support the potential feasibility of the system, pointing out that the energy storage can be used for recharging a 3V-65mAh Li-ion battery, suitable for low-power electronic boards. The model is finally used to characterize a condition-monitoring algorithm in terms of false alarms rejection and vulnerability to dormant faults, by simulating built-in tests to be performed during maintenance.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-02-15", "authors": ["GianpietroDi Rito", "Mario RosarioChiarelli", "BenedettoLuciano"], "doi": "10.3390/s20040950\n10.1121/1.423480\n10.1016/S0003-682X(98)00056-5\n10.1088/0964-1726/8/5/308\n10.1106/LA9C-7PHA-28H7-MEQP\n10.1106/PUK8-H7ET-V3R7-F3FY\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/6/305\n10.1177/1045389X04040079\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/017\n10.1106/104538902032463\n10.1177/1045389X05050098\n10.1177/1045389X05050008\n10.1080/10584580590964574\n10.1111/j.1460-2695.2008.01248.x\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1177/1045389X9700801101\n10.1088/1742-6596/93/1/012034\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2013.09.031\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.02.051\n10.3390/app9142893\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/10/105027\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/3/035010\n10.1108/AEAT-02-2015-0058\n10.1109/JSEN.2011.2167965\n10.1063/1.348323\n10.1088/0964-1726/8/4/302\n10.1243/09596518JSCE588\n10.1177/1687814018768146\n10.1177/1687814016644576"}

This provided the set of relevant material coefficients as a function of composition, which was used to obtain the magnetoelectric responses of model layered structures including a reference magnetostrictive spinel oxide by simulation. The piezoelectric material leading to the highest magnetoelectric coefficient was identified, and shown to be different to that showing the highest piezoelectric coefficient.

{"title": "Wearable Piezoelectric-Based System for Continuous Beat-to-Beat Blood Pressure Measurement.", "abstract": "Non-invasive continuous blood pressure measurement is an emerging issue that potentially can be applied to cardiovascular disease monitoring and prediction. Recently, many groups have proposed the pulse transition time (PTT) method to estimate blood pressure for long-term monitoring. However, the PTT-based methods for blood pressure estimation are limited by non-specific estimation models and require multiple calibrations. This study aims to develop a low-cost wearable piezoelectric-based system for continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement. The pressure change in the radial artery was extracted by systolic and diastolic feature points in pressure pulse wave (PPW) and the pressure sensitivity of the sensor. The proposed system showed a reliable accuracy of systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mean absolute error (MAE) \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) 1.52 \u00b1 0.30 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, MAE \u00b1 SD 1.83 \u00b1 0.50), and its performance agreed with standard criteria of MAE within 5 mmHg and SD within \u00b18 mmHg. In conclusion, this study successfully developed a low-cost, high-accuracy piezoelectric-based system for continuous beat-to-beat SBP and DBP measurement without multiple calibrations and complex regression analysis.

The main purpose of USM development was to design a motor for attitude control systems used in small satellites. A permanent magnetic sphere with a magnetic dipole is used for orientation and positioning when the sphere is rotated to the desired position and the magnetic field synchronizes with the Earth's magnetic dipole. Also, the proposed motor can be installed and used for robotic systems, laser beam manipulation, etc. The system has a minimal number of components, small weight, and high reliability.

Early cancer diagnosis is difficult in low- and middle-income countries, most of which are unable to support population-based mammographic screening. Triage on the basis of clinical breast examination (CBE) alone can be difficult to implement. In contrast, piezo-electric palpation (intelligent Breast Exam [iBE]) may improve triage because it is portable, low cost, has a short learning curve, and provides electronic documentation for additional diagnostic workup. We compared iBE and CBE performance in a screening patient cohort from a Western mammography center.\nWomen presenting for screening or diagnostic workup were enrolled and underwent iBE then CBE, followed by mammography. Mammography was classified as negative (BI-RADS 1 or 2) or positive (BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5). Measures of accuracy and \u03ba score were calculated.\nBetween April 2015 and May 2017, 516 women were enrolled. Of these patients, 486 completed iBE, CBE, and mammography. There were 101 positive iBE results, 66 positive CBE results, and 35 positive mammograms. iBE and CBE demonstrated moderate agreement on categorization (\u03ba = 0.53), but minimal agreement with mammography (\u03ba = 0.08). iBE had a specificity of 80.3% and a negative predictive value of 94%. In this cohort, only five of 486 patients had a malignancy; iBE and CBE identified three of these five. The two cancers missed by both modalities were small-a 3-mm retro-areolar and a 1-cm axillary tail.\niBE performs comparably to CBE as a triage tool.

These are influenced by the reactance changes modifying their electrical characteristics. Reactance in series, in parallel, or a combination of reactances can impact the electrical crystal substitute model by influencing its resonant oscillation frequency. In this way, various physical quantities near resonance can be detected with great sensitivity through a small change of capacitance or inductance. A piezoelectric crystal impedance circle and the mode of frequency changing around the resonant frequency change are shown. This review also presents the influence of reactance on the piezoelectric crystal, the way in which the capacitance lost among the crystal's electrodes is compensated, and how the mode of oscillators' output frequency is converted to lower frequency range (1-100 kHz). Finally, the review also explains the temperature-frequency compensation of the crystals' characteristics in oscillators that use temperature-frequency pair of crystals and the procedure of the compensation of crystals own temperature characteristics based on the method switching between the active and reference reactance.

The cathode composites in LIBs contain both carbon black and PVDF binders in its chemistry. For the rejuvenation process to work, an ability to remove these impurities is desirable. In the present work, de-agglomeration of individual components from the cathode composites has been carried out using a mechanical process that is developed for preserving functional integrity of the cathode active materials. It has been shown that the size of the cathode composites is effectively reduced upon a de-agglomeration process due to a liberation of PVDF binders from the cathode composites. The de-agglomeration performance has been evaluated by separating mixed materials by the degree in surface hydrophobicity using the froth flotation method. The performance improves with end-of-life (EOL) LIBs compared to new LIBs, benefiting from a degradation of PVDF binders after charging-discharging cycles. X-ray photoelectron spectra suggests that the de-agglomeration is done by breaking intermolecular bond between PVDF and cathode active materials as well as covalent bond within PVDF binders.

The unit cells of these three different woven patterns are modelled realistically at a mesoscopic scale, using information from micrographic cross-sections and the mechanical properties of the fibres and matrix materials provided by the manufacturers and the literature. The numerical method, combining the mode-based component mode synthesis and the wave finite element methods, allows for computing the dispersion relations of the modelled samples. Experimentally, dispersion relations are extracted from the samples by means of a linear scan of a wave measured by a laser vibrometer and generated by a piezoelectric transducer.

{"title": "Induced Hydrophilicity and In Vitro Preliminary Osteoblast Response of Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) Coatings Obtained via MAPLE Deposition and Subsequent Thermal Treatment.", "abstract": "Recent advancements in biomedicine have focused on designing novel and stable interfaces that can drive a specific cellular response toward the requirements of medical devices or implants. Among these, in recent years, electroactive polymers (i.e., polyvinylidene fluoride or PVDF) have caught the attention within the biomedical applications sector, due to their insolubility, stability in biological media, in vitro and in vivo non-toxicity, or even piezoelectric properties. However, the main disadvantage of PVDF-based bio-interfaces is related to the absence of the functional groups on the fluoropolymer and their hydrophobic character leading to a deficiency of cell adhesion and proliferation. This work was aimed at obtaining hydrophilic functional PVDF polymer coatings by using, for the first time, the one-step, matrix-assisted pulsed evaporation (MAPLE) method, testing the need of a post-deposition thermal treatment and analyzing their preliminary capacity to support MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell survival. As osteoblast cells are known to prefer rough surfaces, MAPLE deposition parameters were studied for obtaining coatings with roughness of tens to hundreds of nm, while maintaining the chemical properties similar to those of the pristine material. The in vitro studies indicated that all surfaces supported the survival of viable osteoblasts with active metabolisms, similar to the \"control\" sample, with no major differences regarding the thermally treated materials; this eliminates the need to use a secondary step for obtaining hydrophilic PVDF coatings. The physical-chemical characteristics of the thin films, along with the in vitro analyses, suggest that MAPLE is an adequate technique for fabricating PVDF thin films for further bio-applications.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-02-06", "authors": ["Luminita NicoletaDumitrescu", "PatriciaNeacsu", "Madalina GNecula", "AncaBonciu", "ValentinaMarascu", "AnisoaraCimpean", "AntoniuMoldovan", "AndreiRotaru", "ValentinaDinca", "MariaDinescu"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules25030582\n10.3390/s141019115\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.253\n10.1016/j.desal.2013.02.005\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.09.005\n10.1007/s10856-012-4808-y\n10.1016/S0142-9612(99)00242-2\n10.1007/s10856-015-5651-8\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.12.019\n10.1088/1748-605X/ab3c20\n10.1039/C8NR10384D\n10.1039/C5RA08388E\n10.1021/acsami.5b07486\n10.1007/s40204-017-0071-0\n10.1166/sam.2011.1148\n10.1039/c3tc31774a\n10.1016/j.physb.2014.07.076\n10.1016/S0032-3861(98)00747-2\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.09.087\n10.1007/s12648-009-0009-z\n10.2147/IJN.S84312\n10.1155/2015/142195\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00235-7\n10.1088/1748-6041/8/4/045007\n10.1039/c2ra21841k\n10.15761/FNN.1000146\n10.1109/58.726464\n10.1016/S0257-8972(99)00376-X\n10.1021/cr010428w\n10.1002/pcr2.10021\n10.1007/s00339-011-6594-7\n10.1007/s00340-013-5491-5\n10.1021/jp9050897\n10.1007/s00339-011-6624-5\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.11.031\n10.1007/s10544-013-9801-9\n10.1016/j.mssp.2014.10.011\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.02.057\n10.3390/bios4040329\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.07.163\n10.1007/s10973-016-5895-7\n10.1007/s10973-007-8818-9\n10.1002/macp.201370027\n10.1016/j.tca.2009.10.006\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.04.310\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1016/j.cap.2016.10.011\n10.1016/j.pnsc.2012.04.011\n10.1039/C6TA09590A\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.01.109\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.216101\n10.1007/s00339-011-6595-6\n10.1002/ppap.201000072\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2009.04.007\n10.1007/s10856-007-3195-2\n10.1002/pat.1366\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.587-588.72\n10.1088/1748-6041/7/3/035004\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2015.05.001\n10.1143/JPSJ.12.1158\n10.1002/1097-4636(20010615)55:4<475::AID-JBM1039>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.03.004\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.03.035\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0540\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.062\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.019\n10.3390/ma2030833"}

Progress has been made in this area to offer a potential improvement over the conventional cross-correlation method for time delay estimation. This paper is concerned with identifying suitable sensors that can be easily deployed to monitor the pipe vibration due to the propagation of leak noise along the pipeline. In response to this, based on the low-frequency propagation characteristics of leak noise in our previous study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) wire sensors are proposed as a potential solution to detect the pipeline leak signals. Experimental investigations were carried out at a leak detection pipe rig built in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Their performances for leak detection were shown in comparison with hydrophones.

The droplet evaporation process lasts several minutes and greatly accelerates as the fluid advances toward complete evaporation. In order to capture the dynamics of the whole process, two cameras with the same optical output but different temporal resolution are used sequentially.

{"title": "A modified piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique for simultaneous measurement of elastic moduli and internal frictions at varied temperature.", "abstract": "In this work, a modified piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique (M-PUCOT) is developed for measuring a material's elastic moduli and internal frictions, as a function of temperature. Different from the traditional PUCOT that employs two quartz bars as the drive and gauge, here, a single small piezoelectric transducer (PZT) ring is used to drive and sense longitudinal or torsional vibration in a cylinder specimen. Because of the strong piezoelectric effect and relatively large bandwidth of the PZTs compared to their quartz counterpart, the frequency match condition between the transducer and the specimen is not required in this M-PUCOT. For high temperature measurement, a fused quartz spacer, whose resonance frequency matches the specimen's, is bonded between the transducer and the specimen to provide thermal insulation. First, the united equivalent circuit of the transducer- (spacer) -specimen composite system was derived. Then, Young's modulus, longitudinal friction, shear modulus, and torsional friction were explicitly obtained by measuring the resonance frequency and antiresonance frequency of the 2- or 3-component system's electrical susceptance curve using an impedance analyzer. The accuracy of this method was validated both by measuring the system's amplitude-frequency curves using a laser vibrometer and through finite element simulations. The repeatability error of the M-PUCOT is only \u223c0.2% for moduli measurement and \u223c2.5% for internal friction measurement, which is very promising for studying the moduli and internal friction variations during damage, fatigue, and phase transitions. Finally, the M-PUCOT was employed to measure the variations in moduli and internal frictions of an Fe", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2020-02-06", "authors": ["MingyuXie", "FaxinLi"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5135360"}

{"title": "Quantitative Comparison of the Performance of Piezoresistive, Piezoelectric, Acceleration, and Optical Pulse Wave Sensors.", "abstract": "The accurate measurement of the arterial pulse wave is beneficial to clinical health assessment and is important for the effective diagnosis of many types of cardiovascular disease. A variety of sensors have been developed for the non-invasive detection of these waves, but the type of sensor has an impact on the measurement results. Therefore, it is necessary to compare and analyze the signals obtained under a range of conditions using various pulse sensors to aid in making an informed choice of the appropriate type. From the available types we have selected four: a piezoresistive strain gauge sensor (PESG) and a piezoelectric Millar tonometer (the former with the ability to measure contact force), a circular film acceleration sensor, and an optical reflection sensor. Pulse wave signals were recorded from the left radial, carotid, femoral, and digital arteries of 60 subjects using these four sensors. Their performance was evaluated by analyzing their susceptibilities to external factors (contact force, measuring site, and ambient light intensity) and by comparing their stability and reproducibility. Under medium contact force, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the signals was higher than that at high and low force levels and the variability of signal waveform was small. The optical sensor was susceptible to ambient light. Analysis of the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the pulse wave parameters showed that the tonometer and accelerometer had good stability (ICC > 0.80), and the PESG and optical sensor had moderate stability (0.46 < ICC < 0.86). Intra-observer analysis showed that the tonometer and accelerometer had good reproducibility (ICC > 0.75) and the PESG and optical sensor had moderate reproducibility (0.42 < ICC < 0.91).

It remains difficult to assess the properties of bone tissue being osteotomized. Mispositioning of the osteotome or too strong impacts may lead to bone fractures which may have dramatic consequences. The objective of this study is to determine whether an instrumented hammer may be used to retrieve information on the material properties around the osteotome tip. A hammer equipped with a piezo-electric force sensor was used to impact 100 samples of different composite materials and thicknesses. A model-based inversion technique was developed based on the analysis of two indicators derived from the analysis of the variation of the force as a function of time in order to (i) classify the samples depending on their material types, (ii) determine the materials stiffness, and (iii) estimate the samples thicknesses. The model resulting from the classification using support vector machines (SVM) learning techniques can efficiently predict the material of a new sample, with an estimated 89% prediction performance. A good agreement between the forward analytical model and the experimental data was obtained, leading to an average error lower than 10% in the samples thickness estimation. Based on these results, navigation and decision-support tools could be developed and allows surgeons to adapt their surgical strategy in a patient-specific manner.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2020-02-02", "authors": ["AlexisHubert", "GiuseppeRosi", "RomainBosc", "GuillaumeHaiat"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4046200"}

The liquid metal penetration effects are demonstrated in various porous materials such as tissue paper, thick and fine sponges, fabrics, and meshes. The underlying mechanism is that the high surface tension of liquid metal can be significantly reduced to near-zero due to the voltage-induced oxidation of the liquid metal surface in a solution. It is the extremely low surface tension and gravity that cause the liquid metal to superwet the solid surface, leading to the penetration phenomena.

{"title": "The Cellular and Mechanical Basis for Response Characteristics of Identified Primary Afferents in the Rat Vibrissal System.", "abstract": "Compared to our understanding of the response properties of receptors in the auditory and visual systems, we have only a limited understanding of the mechanoreceptor responses that underlie tactile sensation. Here, we exploit the stereotyped morphology of the rat vibrissal (whisker) array to investigate coding and transduction properties of identified primary tactile afferents. We performed in\u00a0vivo intra-axonal recording and labeling experiments to quantify response characteristics of four different types of identified mechanoreceptors in the vibrissal follicle: ring-sinus Merkel; lanceolate; clublike; and rete-ridge collar Merkel. Of these types, only ring-sinus Merkel endings exhibited slowly adapting properties. A weak inverse relationship between response magnitude and onset response latency was found across all types. All afferents exhibited strong \"angular tuning,\" i.e., their response magnitude and latency depended on the whisker's deflection angle. Although previous studies suggested that this tuning should be aligned with the angular location of the mechanoreceptor in the follicle, such alignment was observed only for Merkel afferents; angular tuning of the other afferent types\u00a0showed no clear alignment with mechanoreceptor location. Biomechanical modeling suggested that this tuning difference might be explained by mechanoreceptors' differential sensitivity to the force directed along the whisker length. Electron microscopic investigations of Merkel endings and lanceolate endings at the level of the ring sinus revealed unique anatomical features that may promote these differential sensitivities. The present study systematically integrates biomechanical principles with the anatomical and morphological characterization of primary afferent endings to describe the physical and cellular processing that shapes the neural representation of touch.", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "date": "2020-02-01", "authors": ["TakahiroFuruta", "Nicholas EBush", "Anne En-TzuYang", "SatomiEbara", "NaoyukiMiyazaki", "KazuyoshiMurata", "DaichiHirai", "Ken-IchiShibata", "Mitra J ZHartmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cub.2019.12.068"}

{"title": "Optimization of LiNbO", "abstract": "Multilayered structures can successfully replace single crystal substrates in high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. A combination of high propagation velocity and strong piezoelectric coupling is required for acoustic modes used in wideband high-frequency SAW devices. These characteristics can be achieved simultaneously in SAW devices arranged on a lithium niobate (LN) thin plate bonded to quartz and using longitudinal leaky SAW (LLSAW) if the orientations of both the crystals and the plate thickness are optimized. This article describes an optimization procedure developed to find low-attenuated LLSAWs in layered structures that can be used in LN/quartz applications. The symmetry consideration of two crystals was followed by the optimization of the LN orientation to achieve the largest electromechanical coupling and by an analysis of quartz anisotropy as a crucial factor of the existence of nonattenuated LLSAWs. Finally, the quartz orientation and LN thickness were optimized by a rigorous numerical simulation of resonator admittances and by the extraction of LLSAW attenuation at resonant and antiresonant frequencies.

This work investigates the feasibility of the transmission of digital images over metallic pipes. Ultrasonic communication systems for transmission of images on a nuclear-grade stainless steel pipe were assembled for bench-scale demonstration. Information carriers in this system are refracted shear waves transmitted and received with piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) operating at 2-MHz nominal frequency. The refraction and propagation of ultrasonic shear waves were modeled with COMSOL software. An amplitude shift keying (ASK) communication protocol for image transmission was developed and implemented in the GNURadio software-defined radio (SDR) environment. Digital information was converted to analog ultrasonic signals using Red Pitaya electronic boards. The performance of the ASK protocol is evaluated at the output of every block in the GNURadio program by monitoring the transmission of select characters. Using the ASK communication protocol, the transmission of the 32-KB image was demonstrated at 2-Kbps bitrate across 6-ft-long stainless steel pipe. Preliminary evaluation of ultrasonic communication on the piping of a nuclear facility, such as signal transmission on bent pipes, was performed with COMSOL computer simulations.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-01-30", "authors": ["AlexanderHeifetz", "DmitryShribak", "XinHuang", "BoyangWang", "JafarSaniie", "JaceyYoung", "SasanBakhtiari", "Richard BVilim"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2968891"}

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based pneumatic microvalves are commonly used but they generally require large peripheral connections that decrease portability. There are many alternatives found in the literature that use Si-based microvalves, but variants that can throttle even moderate pressures (1) tend to be bulky (cm-range) or consume high power.

{"title": "Thin films of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)-ionic liquid mixtures as amperometric gas sensing materials for oxygen and ammonia.", "abstract": "Gas sensors are important devices used to monitor the type and amount of gas present. Amperometric gas sensors - based on measuring the current upon an applied potential - have been progressing towards miniaturised designs that are smaller, lower cost, faster responding and more robust compared to commercially available sensors. In this work, a planar thin-film electrode device is employed for gas sensing with a thin layer of gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). The GPE consists of a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL, with two different imidazolium cations and the tetrafluoroborate [BF4]- anion) mixed with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The polymer acts as a scaffold, with the RTIL ions able to flow within the porous percolated channels, resulting in a highly robust gel with high conductivity. The chemical nature of the polymer allows thin-films (ca. 6 \u03bcm) to be evenly dropcast onto planar electrode devices, using minimal amounts of material. Remarkably, no significant effect of resistance was observed in the voltammetric response with such thin films. Oxygen (O2) and ammonia (NH3) gases were detected in the concentration ranges 1-20% O2 and 1-10 ppm NH3 in the two GPEs using both linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and long-term chronoamperometry (LTCA). LTCA was the preferred detection method for both gases due to the steady-state current response compared to the sloping current response from LSV. The thin nature of the film gave fast response times for both gases - less than 10 seconds for O2 and ca. 40 seconds for NH3 - easily rivaling the commercially available porous electrode designs and allowing for continuous monitoring of gas concentrations.

{"title": "Piezoelectricity in the Intervertebral disc.", "abstract": "Lower back pain is a major global health challenge that can often be caused by degeneration of the Intervertebral Disc (IVD). While IVD biomechanics are a key factor in the degenerative cycle, many mechanotransduction pathways remain unknown, in particular the electro-mechanical coupling in the loaded tissue. However, despite evidence for a role in the mechanically-induced remodelling of similar tissue, piezoelectricity has been overlooked in the IVD. In this study, we investigate the piezoelectric properties of the Annulus Fibrosus (AF) and the Nucleus Pulposus (NP) by measuring the direct piezoelectric effect of mechanically-induced electrical potential change. To verify these findings, we conducted Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) to measure the inverse effect of electrically-induced deformation. We demonstrate that, for the first time, piezoelectricity is generated throughout the IVD. Piezoelectric effects were greater in the AF than the NP, owing to the organised collagen networks present. However, the piezoresponse found in the NP indicates piezoelectric properties of non-collagenous proteins that have not yet been studied. The voltage generated by longitudinal piezoelectricity in-vivo has been calculated to be ~1\u00a0nV locally, indicating that piezoelectric effects may directly affect cell alignment in the AF and may work in conjunction with streaming potentials throughout the IVD. In summary, we have highlighted an intricate electro-mechanical coupling that appears to have distinct physiological roles in the AF and NP.

Nanogenerators have many useful applications in the field of intelligent interaction, with the advantages of a self-powered sensing ability, easy fabrication, considerable sensitivity and reliability. However, the singularity of the sensing mode limits its applications. Hence, in this research, a flexible and stretchable dual mode nanogenerator (FSDM-NG) for human motion sensing and information interaction, based on the integration of piezoelectric and triboelectric principles was developed. In piezoelectric mode, the FSDM-NG can effectively monitor the bending angle of joints (finger, wrist and elbow) from 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. In triboelectric mode, text and logic information transfer are encoded using Morse code and logic gates, respectively. In addition, the device has good adhesion and biosafety, and is robust which makes it work normally even in under water environments. Combining these two sensing mechanisms, multiple modes of sensing from touch and stretch based on the FSDM-NG can be achieved for information interaction in real time.

{"title": "A simple and rapid pipeline for identification of receptor-binding sites on the surface proteins of pathogens.", "abstract": "Ligand-receptor interactions play a crucial role in the plethora of biological processes. Several methods have been established to reveal ligand-receptor interface, however, the majority of methods are time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Here we present a straightforward and simple pipeline to identify putative receptor-binding sites on the pathogen ligands. Two model ligands (bait proteins), domain III of protein E of West Nile virus and NadA of Neisseria meningitidis, were incubated with the proteins of human brain microvascular endothelial cells immobilized on nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane, the complex was trypsinized on-membrane, bound peptides of the bait proteins were recovered and detected on MALDI-TOF. Two peptides of DIII (~916\u2009Da and ~2003 Da) and four peptides of NadA (~1453\u2009Da, ~1810 Da, ~2051\u2009Da and ~2433\u2009Da) were identified as plausible receptor-binders. Further, binding of the identified peptides to the proteins of endothelial cells was corroborated using biotinylated synthetic analogues in ELISA and immunocytochemistry. Experimental pipeline presented here can be upscaled easily to map receptor-binding sites on several ligands simultaneously. The approach is rapid, cost-effective and less laborious. The proposed experimental pipeline could be a simpler alternative or complementary method to the existing techniques used to reveal amino-acids involved in the ligand-receptor interface.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2020-01-26", "authors": ["Patr\u00edciaMertinkov\u00e1", "AmodKulkarni", "Evel\u00ednaK\u00e1\u0148ov\u00e1", "Katar\u00ednaBhide", "ZuzanaTk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1", "MangeshBhide"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-58305-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053535\n10.1074/mcp.M111.012187\n10.1128/IAI.05622-11\n10.1093/nar/14.14.5761\n10.1016/j.virol.2008.06.041\n10.1128/IAI.63.4.1573-1580.1995\n10.1093/nar/28.2.e3\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btn498\n10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00170-9\n10.1128/JVI.01125-06\n10.1038/nature10361\n10.1016/j.copbio.2006.06.008\n10.1021/bi00039a015\n10.1074/jbc.M301360200\n10.2174/092986608785849254\n10.1074/jbc.M211235200\n10.1074/jbc.M512450200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088147\n10.1016/S1044-0305(03)00129-6\n10.1016/j.ab.2006.05.037\n10.1038/nbt.2999\n10.1038/nprot.2017.100\n10.1110/ps.0205802\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199607)25:3<267::AID-PROT1>3.0.CO;2-D\n10.18388/abp.2004_3573\n10.1038/nmeth1118\n10.1038/nmeth.1322\n10.1039/c0cc02523b\n10.1073/pnas.87.24.9848\n10.1021/ac060344t\n10.1007/978-1-59745-542-8_35\n10.1074/mcp.M700415-MCP200\n10.1074/jbc.M506614200\n10.4049/jimmunol.0802806\n10.1074/jbc.M110.188326\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01722.x\n10.3390/v6010069\n10.1016/j.virol.2016.02.009\n10.3390/v9120388\n10.1084/jem.20020407\n10.1128/JVI.01840-06\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.03.006\n10.1016/B978-0-12-801430-1.00005-6\n10.3390/ijms17020144\n10.1021/bi011870b\n10.1155/2014/147648\n10.1095/biolreprod58.2.302\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.08.033\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu097\n10.1007/978-1-4939-0366-5_14\n10.1128/JB.00430-10\n10.1099/vir.0.80411-0\n10.1074/jbc.M402385200\n10.1073/pnas.1419686111\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04423.x\n10.1128/mBio.01914-18\n10.1128/JVI.76.24.13097-13100.2002\n10.1128/JVI.78.1.378-388.2004\n10.1128/JVI.78.15.8271-8280.2004\n10.1073/pnas.0832193100\n10.1038/375291a0\n10.1128/JVI.75.16.7769-7773.2001\n10.1006/abio.1993.1413\n10.1016/0003-2697(88)90008-5\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00532.x\n10.3109/08820139409066836\n10.1590/S0074-02761996000200014\n10.1006/abio.1993.1068\n10.1016/0003-2697(84)90166-0\n10.1016/0022-1759(89)90394-3\n10.1021/ac00093a029\n10.1002/pro.5560040607\n10.1021/ac702527b\n10.1038/s41598-018-23485-1"}
{"title": "Parkinson patients without tremor show changed patterns of mechanical muscle oscillations during a specific bilateral motor task compared to controls.", "abstract": "The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still not understood. There are investigations which show a changed oscillatory behaviour of brain circuits or changes in variability of, e.g., gait parameters in PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the motor output differs between PD patients and healthy controls. Thereby, patients without tremor are investigated in the medication off state performing a special bilateral isometric motor task. The force and accelerations (ACC) were recorded as well as the Mechanomyography (MMG) of the biceps brachii, the brachioradialis and of the pectoralis major muscles using piezoelectric-sensors during the bilateral motor task at 60% of the maximal isometric contraction. The frequency, a specific power ratio, the amplitude variation and the slope of amplitudes were analysed. The results indicate that the oscillatory behaviour of motor output in PD patients\u00a0without tremor deviates from controls: thereby, the 95%-confidence-intervals of power ratio and of amplitude variation of all signals are disjoint between PD and controls and show significant differences in group comparisons (power ratio: p\u2009=\u20090.000-0.004, r\u2009=\u20090.441-0.579; amplitude variation: p\u2009=\u20090.000-0.001, r\u2009=\u20090.37-0.67). The mean frequency shows a significant difference for ACC (p\u2009=\u20090.009, r\u2009=\u20090.43), but not for MMG.

By refilling the printer's cartridges with our formulated inks and controlling the red, green, and blue color parameters, a 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09 indicator array was printed onto inkjet transparency films. The color response of the indicator array was tested with different volatile amines at various concentrations. The array indicator was capable of discriminating six different volatile amines: ammonia, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, and hydrazine. The printability of the inks was investigated by characterizing their density, surface tension, and dynamic viscosity, dictating that all formulated inks were printable fluid. The microstructural morphologies of the printed dyes on transparency films were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Interactions of the dye with the volatiles were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In summary, the piezoelectric inkjet printing method presented in this study offers a convenient, efficient, and flexible means to fabricate colorimetric indicators for detecting food spoilage volatiles. These indicators are promising as sensing components in intelligent packaging systems, to reveal the freshness of fish products by correlating with quality parameters such as total volatile basic nitrogen, microbial growth, and sensory attributes. Further studies on the feasibility of using the array indicators in real food packaging systems, development of strategy to mitigate the potential migration of the indicator dyes, and designing array patterns optimal for machine/human interpretation, are important to commercialize the technology. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Piezoelectric inkjet printing offers a convenient way to fabricate sensing materials and aligns with industrial packaging operations. The use of indicators on food package helps consumers more accurately perceive real-time food quality information.", "journal": "Journal of food science", "date": "2020-01-25", "authors": ["XiaoyuLuo", "Loong-TakLim"], "doi": "10.1111/1750-3841.15020"}

{"title": "Phase-Inversion Polymer Composite Separators Based on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanosheets for High-Temperature Lithium-Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "By preventing electrical contact between anode and cathode electrodes while promoting ionic transport, separators are critical components in the safe operation of rechargeable battery technologies. However, traditional polymer-based separators have limited thermal stability, which has contributed to catastrophic thermal runaway failure modes that have conspicuously plagued lithium-ion batteries. Here, we describe the development of phase-inversion composite separators based on carbon-coated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymers that possess high porosity, electrolyte wettability, and thermal stability. The carbon-coated hBN nanosheets are obtained through a scalable liquid-phase shear exfoliation method using ethyl cellulose as a polymer stabilizer and source of the carbon coating following thermal pyrolysis. When incorporated within the PVDF matrix, the carbon-coated hBN nanosheets promote favorable interfacial interactions during the phase-inversion process, resulting in porous, flexible, free-standing composite separators. The unique chemical composition of these carbon-coated hBN separators implies high wettability for a wide range of liquid electrolytes. This combination of high porosity and electrolyte wettability enables enhanced ionic conductivity and lithium-ion battery electrochemical performance that exceeds incumbent polyolefin separators over a wide range of operating conditions. The hBN nanosheets also impart high thermal stability, providing safe lithium-ion battery operation up to 120 \u00b0C.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2020-01-25", "authors": ["Ana C Mde Moraes", "Woo JinHyun", "Norman SLuu", "Jin-MyoungLim", "Kyu-YoungPark", "Mark CHersam"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b18134"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Transducers for Structural Health Monitoring of Joint Structures in Cylinders: A Wave-Based Design Approach.", "abstract": "Joint structures, such as riveting, hinges, and flanges, are widely used in complex mechanical systems. A small unexpected change of a joint can lead to complicated wave-scattering in its connected waveguides. The conversion between wave modes can be used to quantify the variation of the connection status of joints. This gives rise to the challenge of exciting and sensing only one specific wave mode in practice. In this paper, transmitted wave amplitudes of a flange joint are first calculated by the wave finite element method (WFEM) to study the quantitative relationship between the local stiffness changes of the damaged site and the wave-mode conversion. Wave-mode piezoelectric transducers are subsequently designed for torsional, longitudinal, and flexural waves in cylindrical waveguides. The idea is to use the distribution and interconnection of the piezoelectric materials to cancel the charge contributed from the non-targeting waves. We conducted numerical simulations to demonstrate the selective coupling features of the designed wave transducers and found difference of several orders of magnitude in voltages between targeting wave mode and other wave modes. Four selected wave transducers were then extended to monitor the connection status of the flange. The wave-scattering features in the simulation and WFEM were verified to be in good agreement.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-25", "authors": ["WenjunWang", "LinLi", "YuFan", "ZhouJiang"], "doi": "10.3390/s20030601\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/6/012\n10.1177/0583102406065898\n10.1007/978-3-7091-0399-9_1\n10.1016/j.crme.2012.07.001\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1243/09544100jaero378\n10.1177/1475921710365419\n10.3390/s18061928\n10.1155/2018/8210817\n10.1007/s12205-012-1300-7\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/5/019\n10.1063/1.1711617\n10.1016/j.cma.2012.06.011\n10.1002/stc.1739\n10.1016/j.jsv.2018.11.018\n10.1016/j.cma.2008.11.024\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.06.014\n10.1016/j.jsv.2018.11.044\n10.1063/1.5079963\n10.1016/j.net.2014.12.007\n10.1142/S1758825114500355\n10.13700/j.bh.1001-5965.2014.0796\n10.1007/s10921-007-0024-y\n10.1115/1.4029539\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2017.11.015\n10.1016/j.cja.2016.12.011\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.05.014\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.12.006\n10.3390/ma11091656\n10.1007/BF02790171\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2005.05.004\n10.1007/978-3-662-47937-7\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.04.046\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.06.005\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2017.08.012"}

The correlation between hafnium incorporation and performance improvements and the corresponding current conduction mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated to clarify the resistive switching behavior and to explain the oxygen absorption buffer effect. The hafnium atom, with large atomic radius, is surrounded by soft electron clouds and has high chemical activity to attract oxygen ions. It facilitates the accumulation of more oxygen ions around the interface of the top electrode and the resistive switching layer, leading to lower current and Schottky conduction. This study presents an important strategy for designing and developing electrode materials to improve the characteristics of RRAM and offers an indirect method to modify device working behaviors, also unveiling a promising prospect for its potential future application in low-power information storage and calculation technology.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2020-01-24", "authors": ["LeiLi", "Kuan-ChangChang", "CongYe", "XinnanLin", "RuiZhang", "ZhongXu", "YiZhou", "WenXiong", "Tzu-PengKuo"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr08943h"}

We also investigate the role of the sampling time in the current statistics. As a result, we formulate a protocol for optimal sensing based on the modulation of the Fermi level at a fixed bias and provide approximate forms for the current, linear susceptibility, and current fluctuations.

Laser displacement sensors and piezoelectric force balances were used in the synchronous measurement of dynamic displacement and aerodynamic force. Beyond linear flutter boundary, the sectional model exhibited heave-torsion coupled limit cycle oscillation (LCOs) with an unrestricted increase of stable amplitudes with reduced velocity. The post-critical LCOs vibrated in a complex mode with amplitude-dependent mode modulus and phase angle. Obvious heaving static deformation was found to be coupled with the large-amplitude post-critical LCOs, for which classical quasi-steady theory was not applicable. The aerodynamic torsional moment and lift during post-critical LCOs were measured through a novel wind-tunnel technique by 4 piezoelectric force balances. The measured force signals were found to contain significantly higher-order components. The energy evolution mechanism during post-critical LCOs was revealed via the hysteresis loops of the measured force signals.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-24", "authors": ["GuangzhongGao", "LedongZhu", "FengWang", "HuaBai", "JianmingHao"], "doi": "10.3390/s20020568\n10.1016/0167-6105(92)90480-X\n10.1016/S0167-6105(02)00329-X\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2019.05.010\n10.1016/j.jweia.2017.12.007\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2013.09.002\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2017.07.014\n10.1016/j.jweia.2007.02.022\n10.1016/j.jweia.2017.06.020\n10.1016/j.jweia.2019.104048\n10.1016/j.jweia.2019.03.010\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.05.033\n10.1017/S0001925900009069\n10.1016/j.jweia.2016.08.004\n10.1016/j.jweia.2010.01.003\n10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2013.05.001"}

If tissue approximation fails, anastomotic leaks occur. Anastomotic leaks may have catastrophic consequences. The development of a fully absorbable, biocompatible sealant material based on a bio-ink silk fibroin can reduce the chance of anastomotic leaks. We have produced a Ca-modified plasticised regenerated silk (RS) with gold nanorods sealant. This sealant was applied to anastomosed porcine intestine. Water absorption from wet tissue substrate applied compressive strains on hybrid RS films. This compression results in a sealant effect on anastomosis. The increased toughness of the hybrid plasticised RS resulted in the designing of a bio-film with superior elongation at break (i.e., \u2248200%) and bursting pressure. We have also reported structure-dependent piezoelectricity of the RS film that shows a piezoelectric effect out of the plane.

TNL is one of the promising atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based lithography processes which is more effective fabrication technology, as compared to conventional photolithography due to its relatively simple processes, high resolution, short processing time, and low cost. We propose ultra-precision machining at sub-0 \u00b0C temperatures using a lab-made micro polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool on a retrofitted piezo stage with a Peltier device. The workpiece, located on the stage, is cooled artificially, and a normal load of several mN is applied by a micro PCD tool for micro scale machining processes. The machining results indicated considerably different machinability when the work was performed at sub-0 \u00b0C, as opposed to the ambient surface temperature, due to the changed mechanical characteristics of surface by the forced cooling of the workpiece. Although the normal load, machining speed, and machining area remained constant, the width and depth of machined grooves are significantly increased at sub-0 \u00b0C temperature conditions. In addition, we analyzed the TNL characteristics when machining with the PCD tool in four different machining directions.

This study presents experimental and analytical investigations on sensor fault diagnosis for impedance-based SHM using the piezoelectric interface technique. Firstly, the piezoelectric interface-based impedance monitoring is experimentally conducted on a steel bolted connection to investigate the effect of structural damage and sensor defect on electromechanical (EM) impedance responses. Based on the experimental analysis, sensor diagnostic approaches using EM impedance features are designed to distinguish the sensor defect from the structural damage. Next, a novel impedance model of the piezoelectric interface-driven system is proposed for the analytical investigation of sensor fault diagnosis. Various parameters are introduced into the EM impedance formulation to model the effect of shear-lag phenomenon, sensor breakage, sensor debonding, and structural damage. Finally, the proposed impedance model is used to analytically estimate the change in EM impedance responses induced by the structural damage and the sensor defect.

In the general Lamb wave inspection, difference between the baselines and the measured signals are used for structural damage evaluation. However, the baselines are unavoidably influenced by operational and environmental conditions leads to an increased error during inspection. To deal with this issue, this paper presents a base-line free method based on the mode conversion and reciprocity principle of Lamb wave. Once the defect is asymmetrical with respect to the transducer pair (two identical piezoelectric transducers used as actuator and receiver respectively), the elastic wave path length of the converted mode will be different, resulting in failing of the reciprocity principle. By processing the signals received by the transducer pair and extracting the time parameters of the wave packets in mode conversion signals, the defect can be localized. Results from the signals generated by numerical simulation are presented to verify the feasibility of the method, and the effectiveness of the proposed baseline-free method is demonstrated with experimental results.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-01-21", "authors": ["HongboJia", "HongweiLiu", "ZhichunZhang", "FuhongDai", "YanjuLiu", "JinsongLeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106063"}

Serum testosterone levels, spermatozoa parameters and testicular histological morphology were assessed. Resveratrol treatment was shown to significantly reduce serum cholesterol, prevent the HFD-induced reductions in serum testosterone and spermatozoa parameters, and decrease the ultrastructural degeneration of testicular tissues. The comparative proteomics analysis revealed 58 differentially expressed proteins between the HFD and control groups and 38 differentially expressed proteins between the HFD and HFD+RSV groups.

To demonstrate this, many researchers have reported on the correlation with the yield strength obtained from a tensile test.

In this study, to address this issue, the authors have defined the ultrasonic nonlinearity parameter under uniaxial stress conditions which were the same as the tensile test, and showed that the correlation with the yield strength was higher than the currently used ultrasonic nonlinearity parameter. To verify the validity of the proposed ultrasonic nonlinearity parameter, experiments were carried out for Al6061-T6 alloy specimens heat-treated with different aging times.

{"title": "In situ disbond detection in adhesive bonded multi-layer metallic joint using time-of-flight variation of guided wave.", "abstract": "Adhesive bonded joints are frequently adopted in structural applications. The adhesive aging, low quality of surface preparation, as well as the exposure to external harsh environment and loading, may degrade the quality of adhesive, leading to disbond and decrease of the interfacial strength of the bonded joints. This study addresses both numerical and experimental investigations of ultrasonic guided wave (UGW) propagating in adhesive bonded metallic waveguide, whereby disbond detection is realized based on variation of the wave arrival time of UGW. First the dispersion curves of UGWs in both intact (bonded) and disbonded joints are obtained via the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method, and are grouped into mode pairs of phase velocity match and mis-match, respectively. Then a model combining SAFE and Frequency Domain Finite Element (SAFE-FDFE) is developed to enable excitation of any UGW of desired single mode-frequency combination and analysis of the wave interaction with disbond. The obtained results indicate that the UGW Mode 2 generated at the low frequency range of the mis-matched group shows a good sensitivity to disbond, featuring variation of the wave arrival time induced by mode conversion. Finally, Time Domain Finite Element and a proof-of-concept experiment, with comb transducers to act as both in situ actuators and sensors made of PVDF sheets embedded into the adhesive layer, well validate the results obtained via SAFE-FDFE. The selected mode-frequency combination Mode 2 at 0.52\u00a0MHz for wave time-of-arrival-based disbond detection, compared with conventional signal-amplitude-based disbond indicator using high frequency UGWs (~several MHz), merits the advantages of better controllability of wave excitation, less wave attenuation, and higher robustness.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2020-01-18", "authors": ["MenglongLiu", "ShutingChen", "Zheng ZhengWong", "KuiYao", "FangsenCui"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106062"}

After preparation, composites were characterized for their morphologies, structures, functional groups, thermal stability and dielectric characterizations by using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis and impedance spectroscopy. Dielectric results showed that prepared flexible composite exhibited dielectric constant of 70.4 with minor leakage current (tan\u03b4) i.e., 0.39 at 100 Hz.

{"title": "Effect of Process Orientation on the Mechanical Behavior and Piezoelectricity of Electroactive Paper.", "abstract": "This paper reports the effect of process orientation on the mechanical behavior and piezoelectricity of electroactive paper (EAPap) made from natural cotton pulp. EAPap is fabricated by a casting and wet drawing of cellulose film after dissolving cotton with LiCl and DMAc solvent. During the fabrication, permanent wrinkles, a possible factor for performance deterioration, were found in the films. Finite element method was introduced to identify the formation mechanism behind the wrinkles. The simulation results show that the wrinkles were caused by buckling and are inevitable under any conditions. The tensile and piezoelectric tests show that the orientation dependency of the stretched EAPap gives the anisotropic characteristics on both mechanical and piezoelectric properties. In this research, the anisotropic elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios are reported. The piezoelectric charge constant of EAPap in the linear elastic is calculated. The piezoelectric charge constants of EAPap are associated with the alignment angle in the order of 45\u00b0 > 0\u00b0 > 90\u00b0 due to the strong shear effect. The higher stretching ratio gives the higher piezoelectricity due to the alignment of the molecular chains and the microstructure in EAPap. The highest piezoelectric charge constant is found to be 12 pC/N at a stretching ratio of 1.6 and aligning angle of 45\u00b0.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-18", "authors": ["SeanYoon", "Jung WoongKim", "Hyun ChanKim", "JaehwanKim"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13010204\n10.1143/JPSJ.10.149\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00309\n10.1021/ma060261e\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.07.016\n10.1007/s12206-011-0718-z\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08095.x\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/7/073001\n10.1007/s12541-018-0162-4\n10.2514/6.2002-1369\n10.3390/ma6041270\n10.1002/pol.1969.160070207\n10.1007/BF00521872\n10.3390/s100301473"}

{"title": "Single-Neuron Adaptive Hysteresis Compensation of Piezoelectric Actuator Based on Hebb Learning Rules.", "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive hysteresis compensation approach for a piezoelectric actuator (PEA) using single-neuron adaptive control. For a given desired trajectory, the control input to the PEA is dynamically adjusted by the error between the actual and desired trajectories using Hebb learning rules. A single neuron with self-learning and self-adaptive capabilities is a non-linear processing unit, which is ideal for time-variant systems. Based on the single-neuron control, the compensation of the PEA's hysteresis can be regarded as a process of transmitting biological neuron information. Through the error information between the actual and desired trajectories, the control input is adjusted via the weight adjustment method of neuron learning. In addition, this paper also integrates the combination of Hebb learning rules and supervised learning as teacher signals, which can quickly respond to control signals. The weights of the single-neuron controller can be constantly adjusted online to improve the control performance of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed single-neuron adaptive hysteresis compensation method can track continuous and discontinuous trajectories well.

Four permanent magnets are arranged on the rotating mass block and their positions correspond to the permanent magnets on the cantilever beams.

Carbon nanotube (CNT) and organo-montmorillonite (30B) were used individually and simultaneously as reinforcing nanofillers for the immiscible PA6/PVDF blend. Scanning electron micrographs showed that adding 30B reduced the dispersed domain size of PVDF in the blend, and CNT played a vital role in the formation of a quasi-co-continuous PA6-PVDF morphology. Transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that both fillers were mainly located in the PA6 matrix phase. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the presence of 30B facilitated the formation of \u03b3-form PA6 crystals in the composites. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the crystallization temperature of PA6 increased after adding CNT into the blend. The inclusion of 30B retarded PA6 nucleation (\u03b3-form crystals growth) upon crystallization. The Young's and flexural moduli of the blend increased after adding CNT and/or 30B. 30B exhibited higher enhancing efficiency compared with CNT. The composite with 2 phr 30B exhibited 21% higher Young's modulus than the blend. Measurements of the rheological properties confirmed the development of a pseudo-network structure in the CNT-loaded composites.

{"title": "Tension Monitoring of Wedge Connection Using Piezoceramic Transducers and Wavelet Packet Analysis Method.", "abstract": "A steel strand is widely used in long span prestressed concrete bridges. The safety and stability of a steel strand are important issues during its operation period. A steel strand is usually subjected to various types of prestress loss which loosens the anchorage system, negatively impacting the stability of the structure and even leading to severe accidents. In this paper, the authors propose a wavelet packet analysis method to monitor the looseness of the wedge anchorage system by using stress wave-based active sensing. As a commonly used piezoceramic material, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is employed with a strong piezoelectric effect. In the proposed active sensing approach, PZT patches are used as sensors and actuators to monitor the steel strand looseness. The anchorage system consists of the steel strand, wedges and barrel, which forms two different direct contact surfaces to monitor the tension force. PZT patches are pasted on the surface of each steel strand, corresponding wedge and barrel, respectively. Different combinations of PZTs are formed to monitor the anchoring state of the steel strand according to the position of the PZT patches. In this monitoring method of two contact surfaces, one PZT patch is used as an actuator to generate a stress wave and the other corresponding PZT patch is used as a sensor to detect the propagated waves through the wedge anchorage system. The function of these two PZTs were exchanged with the changing of transmission direction. The wavelet packet analysis method is utilized to analyze the transmitted signal between PZT patches through the steel strand anchorage system. Compared with the wavelet packet energy of received signals under different PZT combinations, it could be found that the wavelet packet energy increased with the increasing of anchorage system tightness. Therefore, the wavelet packet energy of received signal could be used to monitor the tightness of the steel strand during operation. Additionally, the wavelet packet energy of the received signals are different when the same PZT combination exchanges the energy transfer direction. With the comparison on the received signals of different combinations of PZTs, the optimal energy transfer path corresponding to different contact surfaces of the steel strand could be determined and the optimal experimental results are achieved.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-16", "authors": ["XiaoyuZhang", "LiuyuZhang", "LaijunLiu", "LinshengHuo"], "doi": "10.3390/s20020364\n10.1016/j.strusafe.2005.11.002\n10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000909\n10.1166/jno.2017.2291\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.01.021\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.11.003\n10.1617/s11527-006-9112-1\n10.13722/j.cnki.jrme.2014.1690\n10.3788/CJL201744.0410001\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.05.015\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.07.009\n10.1177/1475921710395812\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.03.010\n10.1121/1.4955080\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.05.003\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.11.041\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.11.021\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2013.11.005\n10.1002/stc.1586\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.05.003\n10.1007/s12205-017-0844-y\n10.1002/stc.2189\n10.1007/BF02428094\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2001)127:6(599)\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.11.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/2/010\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2002)15:3(97)\n10.1177/1077546310393440\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/004\n10.3390/s17102239\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.1.135\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035010\n10.3390/s18114018\n10.1177/1475921703036169\n10.3390/app7080789\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115020\n10.1155/2015/695845\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.11.014"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Scaffolds as Smart Materials for Neural Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Injury to the central or peripheral nervous systems leads to the loss of cognitive and/or sensorimotor capabilities, which still lacks an effective treatment. Tissue engineering in the post-injury brain represents a promising option for cellular replacement and rescue, providing a cell scaffold for either transplanted or resident cells. Tissue engineering relies on scaffolds for supporting cell differentiation and growth with recent emphasis on stimuli responsive scaffolds, sometimes called smart scaffolds. One of the representatives of this material group is piezoelectric scaffolds, being able to generate electrical charges under mechanical stimulation, which creates a real prospect for using such scaffolds in non-invasive therapy of neural tissue. This paper summarizes the recent knowledge on piezoelectric materials used for tissue engineering, especially neural tissue engineering. The most used materials for tissue engineering strategies are reported together with the main achievements, challenges, and future needs for research and actual therapies. This review provides thus a compilation of the most relevant results and strategies and serves as a starting point for novel research pathways in the most relevant and challenging open questions.",

In addition to the complexity, this also escalates the cost incurred per device. Further, the use of stable external power supplies to produce such a pumping action adds to the bulkiness of the pumps, making them unsuitable for point-of-care diagnostic (POCD) applications. This paper reports a technique of pumping that is simple to realize and does not require external electric/magnetic power, but exploits the elastic properties of materials to achieve the pumping action. This mechanism of pumping ensured the cost per pump to less than 4 USD and can be used for at least 500 times. Several simulations, validation, and characterization experiments were performed on the developed pump to establish its functionality and suitability for use in POCD applications.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2020-01-16", "authors": ["GangadharEluru", "Jayesh VasudevaAdhikari", "PriyalaxitaChanda", "Sai SivaGorthi"], "doi": "10.3390/mi11010067\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/6/R01\n10.1016/S0925-4005(04)00108-X\n10.3390/ijms12063648\n10.1016/j.snb.2007.10.064\n10.1115/1.1459075\n10.1039/C6LC00032K\n10.1039/b900139e\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085043\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/10/105010\n10.1016/0924-4247(90)85039-7\n10.1109/84.911097\n10.1016/0924-4247(90)85037-5\n10.1007/s10404-008-0399-9\n10.1088/0960-1317/4/4/010\n10.1021/ac035188u\n10.1016/j.jala.2010.01.012\n10.1007/s10404-011-0867-5\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00302-7\n10.1039/C4LC00920G\n10.1073/pnas.0503287102\n10.1039/C5LC00716J\n10.1063/1.4930120\n10.1002/bit.26341\n10.1007/s00216-015-9301-2\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.01.005"}

The ZnO thin film is developed on the paper substrate, where different doping concentrations of Sn have been investigated systematically to validate the effect of doping towards enhancing the device performance. The piezoelectric potential of the fabricated device is evaluated by applying three different loads (4 N, 8 N, 22 N), where the source of the corresponding mechanical loads is based on the object of a musical drum stick. The results suggest that the pristine ZnO PENG device can generate a maximum output voltage and current of 2.15 V and 17 nA respectively. Moreover, the ZnO PENG device doped with 2.5% Sn achieved an even higher voltage (4.15 V) and current (36 nA) compared to pristine ZnO devices.

{"title": "Piezoelectricity in Multilayer Black Phosphorus for Piezotronics and Nanogenerators.", "abstract": "Recently, piezoelectric characteristics have been a research focus for 2D materials because of their broad potential applications. Black phosphorus (BP) is a monoelemental 2D material predicted to be piezoelectric because of its highly directional properties and non-centrosymmetric lattice structure. However, piezoelectricity is hardly reported in monoelemental materials owing to their lack of ionic polarization, but piezoelectric generation is consistent with the non-centrosymmetric structure of BP. Theoretical calculations of phosphorene have explained the origin of piezoelectric polarization among P atoms. However, the disappearance of piezoelectricity in multilayer 2D material generally arises from the opposite orientations of adjacent atomic layers, whereas this effect is limited in BP lattices due to their spring-shaped space structure. Here, the existence of in-plane piezoelectricity is experimentally reported for multilayer BP along the armchair direction. Current-voltage measurements demonstrate a piezotronic effect in this orientation, and cyclic compression and release of BP flakes show an intrinsic current output as large as 4 pA under a compressive strain of -0.72%. The discovery of piezoelectricity in multilayer BP can lead to further understanding of this mechanism in monoelemental materials.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2020-01-14", "authors": ["WendaMa", "JunfengLu", "BensongWan", "DengfengPeng", "QianXu", "GuofengHu", "YiyaoPeng", "CaofengPan", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201905795"}

{"title": "In vivo biocompatibility study of degradable homo- versus multiblock copolymers and their (micro)structure compared to an established biomaterial.", "abstract": "Copolyetheresterurethane (PDC) is a biodegradable, shape-memory biomaterial, which has been shown to be of low toxicity and pro-angiogenic in vitro. In the present study we examined the in vivo compatibility of PDC as a compression molded film and as electrospun scaffolds and its well established constituent, the homopolymer poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO), which were compared with the clinically used poly[(vinylidene fluoride)-co-hexafluoropropene] (PVDF) as reference material. The materials were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of mice and the host responses were analyzed histologically 7 and 28 days after implantation.All materials induced a foreign body response (FRB) including the induction of foreign body giant cells and a peripheral fibrous capsule. PDC, PPDO and PVDF films showed no signs of degradation after 28 days. PDC films showed a significantly reduced associated macrophage layer and fibrous capsule on their surface. Few fragments of PDC and PPDO scaffolds were present at the implantation site, while PVDF scaffolds were still present in large amounts at day 28. Especially aligned electrospun PDC scaffold induced a significantly thinner fibrous and a slightly reduced inflammatory response after 28 days of implantation. In addition, only PDC aligned fibrous scaffold structures induced a significant increase in angiogenesis.In summary, PDC films outperformed PPDO and PVDF films in terms of compatibility, especially in capsule and macrophage layer thickness. Through microstructuring of PDC and PPDO into scaffolds an almost complete degradation was observed after 28 days, while their respective films remained almost unchanged. However, the capsule thickness of all scaffolds was comparable to the films after 28 days. Finally, the parallel arrangement of PDC fibers enabled a strong enhancement of angiogenesis within the scaffold. Hence, material chemistries influence overall compatibility in vivo, while angiogenesis could be influenced more strongly by microstructural parameters than chemical ones.", "journal": "Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation", "date": "2020-01-14", "authors": ["TobiasHaase", "RobertKlopfleisch", "AnnalenaKrost", "TilmanSauter", "KarlKratz", "JanPeter", "FriedrichJung", "AndreasLendlein", "DietlindZohlnh\u00f6fer", "ConstantinR\u00fcder"], "doi": "10.3233/CH-190748"}

According to the experimental results, approximate 20\u00a0ng proteins could be detected in 3\u00a0min in room temperature. The staining on the proteins is easily reversible with Congo red destaining solution for NC and PVDF membranes, so that the blot membranes can be reused for Western blotting.

The effect of the MOF precursor and the polymer initial amount on the morphology of the final composite was thoroughly studied. The interaction between the MOF and the polymer during the evaporation process is the key factor, which would limit the mobility of the polymer chains and cause instability in the MOF growth, thus endowing the composite with a hierarchically macro-meso-micro porous structure.

Although potassium sodium-niobate {(K,Na)NbO3, KNN} based ceramics are believed to be one of the most promising lead-free candidates, the relatively inferior piezoelectric properties and strong temperature dependency have hindered their development for more than 50 years since being discovered in the 1950s. It was not until 2014 that our group initially proposed a new phase boundary (NPB) that simultaneously improved the piezoelectric properties and temperature stability of non-textured KNN-based ceramics to the level of partly lead-based ceramics. The NPB has been then proved by some researchers and believed to pave the way for \"lead-free at last\" proposed by E. Cross (Nature, 2004, 432, 24). However, the understanding of the NPB is still in its infancy, leaving many controversies, including the phase structure and physical mechanisms at the NPB as well as the essential difference when compared with other phase boundaries. In this context, we systematically summarized the origin and development of the NPB, focusing on the construction, structure and intrinsic trait of the NPB, the effects of the NPB on the performance, and the validity and related incipient devices of the NPB. Particularly, we concluded the phase structure and domain structure locating at the NPB, analyzed the physical mechanisms in depth, proposed the possible methods to further improve the performance at the NPB, and demonstrated the validity and scope of the NPB as well as the device application. Finally, we gave out our perspective on the challenges and future research of KNN-based ceramics with NPB.

{"title": "Recent Developments and Prospects of M13- Bacteriophage Based Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Devices.", "abstract": "Recently, biocompatible energy harvesting devices have received a great deal of attention for biomedical applications. Among various biomaterials, viruses are expected to be very promising biomaterials for the fabrication of functional devices due to their unique characteristics. While other natural biomaterials have limitations in mass-production, low piezoelectric properties, and surface modification, M13 bacteriophages (phages), which is one type of virus, are likely to overcome these issues with their mass-amplification, self-assembled structure, and genetic modification. Based on these advantages, many researchers have started to develop virus-based energy harvesting devices exhibiting superior properties to previous biomaterial-based devices. To enhance the power of these devices, researchers have tried to modify the surface properties of M13 phages, form biomimetic hierarchical structures, control the dipole alignments, and more. These methods for fabricating virus-based energy harvesting devices can form a powerful strategy to develop high-performance biocompatible energy devices for a wide range of practical applications in the future.

{"title": "Recent Progress of Miniature MEMS Pressure Sensors.", "abstract": "Miniature Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) pressure sensors possess various merits, such as low power consumption, being lightweight, having a small volume, accurate measurement in a space-limited region, low cost, little influence on the objects being detected. Accurate blood pressure has been frequently required for medical diagnosis. Miniature pressure sensors could directly measure the blood pressure and fluctuation in blood vessels with an inner diameter from 200 to 1000 m. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases usually resulting from abnormal intraocular pressure. The implantable pressure sensor for real-time inspection would keep the disease from worsening; meanwhile, these small devices could alleviate the discomfort of patients. In addition to medical applications, miniature pressure sensors have also been used in the aerospace, industrial, and consumer electronics fields. To clearly illustrate the \"miniature size\", this paper focuses on miniature pressure sensors with an overall size of less than 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm or a pressure sensitive diaphragm area of less than 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm. In this paper, firstly, the working principles of several types of pressure sensors are briefly introduced. Secondly, the miniaturization with the development of the semiconductor processing technology is discussed. Thirdly, the sizes, performances, manufacturing processes, structures, and materials of small pressure sensors used in the different fields are explained in detail, especially in the medical field. Fourthly, problems encountered in the miniaturization of miniature pressure sensors are analyzed and possible solutions proposed.

High membrane flux, low energy consumption, efficient fouling control and no damage to the microalgae could thus be realized.

{"title": "MEG3/MIR-376B-3P/HMGA2 axis is involved in pituitary tumor invasiveness.", "abstract": "To date, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have proven to function as key regulators in tumorigenesis. Among these lncRNAs, MEG3 displays low levels in various neoplasms and tumor cell lines. However, the regulatory mechanism of MEG3 and MIR-376B-3P, one of the microRNAs from downstream gene clusters of the DLK1-MEG3 locus, remains insufficiently defined.\nThe authors used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to analyze whether decreased MEG3 and MIR-376B-3P expression levels were associated with the invasiveness of clinical nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (CNFPAs) in 30 patients. Furthermore, functional experiments unveiled the pathophysiological role of MEG3, MIR-376B-3P, and HMGA2 in pituitary-derived folliculostellate (PDFS) cell lines. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were applied to reveal the correlations among MEG3, MIR-376B-3P, and HMGA2.\nMEG3 and MIR-376B-3P were decreased in patients with CNFPA, and their transcriptional levels were highly associated with invasive CNFPAs. Moreover, excessive expression of MEG3 and MIR-376B-3P inhibited tumorigenesis and promoted apoptosis in PDFS cells. Importantly, the authors found that MEG3 acted as an enhancer of MIR-376B-3P expression. Furthermore, as a target gene of MIR-376B-3P, HMGA2 served as an oncogene in pituitary adenoma and could be negatively regulated by MEG3 via enriching MIR-376B-3P.\nThis study offers a novel mechanism of an MEG3/MIR-376B-3P/HMGA2 regulatory network in CNFPAs, which may become a breakthrough for anticancer treatments.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2020-01-04", "authors": ["DiminZhu", "ZhengXiao", "ZongmingWang", "BinHu", "ChengbinDuan", "ZiyanZhu", "NailinGao", "YonghongZhu", "HaijunWang"], "doi": "10.3171/2019.10.JNS191959"}
{"title": "Defects and Aliovalent Doping Engineering in Electroceramics.", "abstract": "Since the positive influences of defects on the performance of electroceramics were discovered, investigations concerning on defects and aliovalent doping routes have grown rapidly in the fields of inorganic chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this article, we summarized the types of defects in electroceramics as well as characterization tools of defects and highlighted the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic defects on the material performances with the emphasis on dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties. We mainly introduced defect related theoretical simulation and experimental results in several typical incipient ferroelectrics, ferroelectrics, and antiferroelectrics. Hence, the influences of defects on the crystal lattice were summed up, and then the main physical mechanisms were highlighted.

{"title": "Aspect Ratio-Dependent Dynamics of Piezoelectric Transducers in Wireless Acoustic Power Transfer.", "abstract": "Acoustic power transfer (APT) for wireless electronic components has received growing attention as a viable approach to deliver power to remotely located small electronic devices. The design of an efficient APT system requires accurate models to describe its individual components as well as the interaction between them. Most of the analytical models available to represent the bulk piezoelectric transducers used in APT are limited to either thin rod or thin plate transducers. However, transducers with moderate aspect ratios are often used, especially at the receiver end. In this work, in addition to reviewing standard theories, models based on the Rayleigh and Bishop rod theories are developed to analyze transducers [transmitter (TX) or receiver (RX)] with various aspect ratios. Results from these models are compared with experimental data and finite-element analysis to determine the range of aspect ratios in which they are valid. In addition, fluid loading effects on the predictions of all models are investigated, and the generated pressure fields by the transducers with different aspect ratios are compared. The resulting models are used to analyze the effect of aspect ratio on the performance of the transducer when operated as a TX or an RX in an APT setting.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-01-04", "authors": ["AhmedAllam", "Karim GSabra", "AlperErturk"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2962711"}

Pore blocking model was used to identify the fouling mechanism, foulant constituents were revealed by FT-IR spectra. The effect of microfiltration on permeate quality of mulberry wine was also involved. The results indicated that cake formation was the dominant mechanism during steady-state of mulberry wine microfiltration, independently on the membrane property. The fouling layer was mainly composed of protein and polysaccharides, which induced basically reversible overall filtration resistance. Microfiltration delivered a superior clarity, highly polydisperse and light-color mulberry wine with a satisfactory sterilization stability.

CPEs provide naked eye detection possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with nucleic acid concentrations down to 1\u00a0nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye detection of nucleic acids. Cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance, RGB analysis.

This allows the microwave cavity to actuate the gigahertz-frequency mechanical breathing mode in the optomechanical crystal through the piezoelectric effect, which is then read out using a telecom optical mode. The gallium arsenide optomechanical crystal is a good candidate for low-noise microwave-to-telecom transduction, as it has been previously cooled to the mechanical ground state in a dilution refrigerator.

The electrospun PZT nanofibers have high aspect ratio and could enhance the generation and accumulation of the piezoelectric charges in the two electrodes of the composite film. By virtue of the inherently high piezoelectric coefficient of PZT material and high aspect ratio of PZT nanofibers, the composite film (75 wt% PZT nanofibers) presents high force-electric conversion capability and high sensitivity.

Today, cystoscopy is the gold standard for bladder cancer assessment, using white light endoscopy to detect tumor suspected lesion areas, followed by resection of these areas and subsequent histopathological evaluation. Not only does the pathological examination take days, but due to the invasive nature, the performed biopsy can result in significant harm to the patient. Nowadays, optical modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Raman spectroscopy (RS), have proven to detect cancer in real time and can provide more detailed clinical information of a lesion, e.g. its penetration depth (stage) and the differentiation of the cells (grade). In this paper, we present an ex vivo study performed with a combined piezoelectric tube-based OCT-probe and fiber optic RS-probe imaging system that allows large field-of-view imaging of bladder biopsies, using both modalities and co-registered visualization, detection and grading of cancerous bladder lesions. In the present study, 119 examined biopsies were characterized, showing that fiber-optic based OCT provides a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 69% for the detection of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, while RS, on the other hand, provides a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 61% for the grading of low- and high-grade tissues. Moreover, the study shows that a piezoelectric tube-based OCT probe can have significant endurance, suitable for future long-lasting in vivo applications.

This article focuses on the inspection of the wedge-like seal fins of a jet engine drum, though the capabilities presented will be generic. It is proposed that antisymmetric flexural edge modes, feature-guided waves localized to the wedge tips, may be used for defect detection. Although analytical solutions exist that characterize the ultrasonic behavior of ideal wedges, in practice, real wedges will be irregular (containing, for example, truncated tips that are built onto an associated structure or have nonstraight edges), and therefore, generic methodologies are required to characterize wave behavior in nonideal wedges. This article uses a semianalytical finite-element (SAFE) methodology to characterize the guided waves in wedge-like features with irregular cross sections to assess their suitability for NDE inspection and compare them with edge modes in ideal wedges. The science and methodologies required in this article are necessary to select an appropriate operating frequency for the particular application at hand. In addition, this article addresses the practical challenge of excitation and detection of flexural edge modes by presenting a piezoelectric-based dry-coupled transducer system suitable for pulse-echo operation.

{"title": "Superconducting straintronics via the proximity effect in superconductor-ferromagnet nanostructures.", "abstract": "We propose the concept of superconducting straintronic devices based on the proximity effect at superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces and the ability of ferromagnets with a strong magnetoelastic coupling to change magnetization orientations under strain. Since strains can be generated electrically with the aid of a piezoelectric transducer attached to a superconductor-ferromagnet nanostructure, the power consumption of the resulting hybrid straintronic device could be greatly reduced in comparison with a superconducting spin valve operated by external magnetic field. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we theoretically describe the strain-mediated magnetoelectric control of the critical temperature Tc in asymmetric ferromagnet-superconductor-ferromagnet trilayers integrated onto a ferroelectric substrate. To that end, Tc is first calculated as a function of the misorientation angle \u0394\u03c6 between the in-plane magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers. Numerical calculations performed for CoFe/Nb/NiCu trilayers show that, at optimal nanoscale thicknesses of superconducting and ferromagnetic films, the variation of \u0394\u03c6 may change Tc significantly (\u0394Tc \u223c 1 K). Then electric-field-induced magnetization rotations are determined for CoFe/Nb/NiCu trilayers coupled to the Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-6%PbTiO3 single crystal. It is found that, owing to the opposite sign of the magnetoelastic coupling in CoFe and NiCu alloys, the misorientation angle \u0394\u03c6 can be changed by up to 90\u00b0 without the introduction of an antiferromagnetic pinning layer. As a result, the electrical switching of the Nb interlayer between the superconducting state and a finite-resistance state appears to be possible in a narrow temperature range. Hence the described multiferroic hybrid can be employed as an electrically controlled resistive switch useful for memory and logic applications in cryogenic electronics.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-12-13", "authors": ["E OSavostin", "N APertsev"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr06739f"}

Long-term exposure of stress could affect one's physiological wellbeing (such as hypertension) and psychological condition (such as depression). Multisensory information such as heart rate variability (HRV) and pH can provide suitable information about mental and physical stress. This paper proposes a novel approach for stress condition monitoring using disposable flexible sensors. By integrating flexible amplifiers with a commercially available flexible polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) mechanical deformation sensor and a pH-type chemical sensor, the proposed system can detect arterial pulses from the neck and pH levels from sweat located in the back of the body. The system uses organic thin film transistor (OTFT)-based signal amplification front-end circuits with modifications to accommodate the dynamic signal ranges obtained from the sensors. The OTFTs were manufactured on a low-cost flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate using a coater capable of Roll-to-Roll (R2R) deposition. The proposed system can capture physiological indicators with data interrogated by Near Field Communication (NFC).

The phase transition is represented by the displacement of the middle-layer Te atoms from the center of the unit cell in the y-direction. The critical point for the phase transition is found to be at 0.5% biaxial tensile strain. By analyzing the bond variation and the phonon spectra, we attribute the phase transition to the decrease of the bonding strength at the tensile strain and the atom migration corresponding to the phonon vibration mode along the distorted direction. The transition to the \u03b1-phase under strain is further confirmed from the calculated electronic band structure where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a large Rashba splitting due to symmetry breaking, which may enable the control of spin via the electric field.

The uniqueness of the harvester lies in the fact that the energy of 2-D excitation is scavenged by a single piezoelectric stack transducer, which can reduce the loss of harvestable energy. The harvester is constructed by the integration of permanent magnets, position protection plates, and multistage force amplification frame. The input force and input displacement are restricted to guarantee the device's safety. The reported multistage force amplification frame with leverage mechanism and bridge-type amplifier enlarges the force acting on the piezoelectric stack, which further improves the power output. A linear guiding mechanism based on leaf flexure is applied to minimize the impact of input forces in other than moving directions. Through analytical modeling, the main architectural parameters of the device are determined. Simulation study with finite-element analysis is conducted to optimize the device parameters for achieving the largest force amplification ratio with a high safety factor.

The Rayleigh wave is widely used for detecting these surface defects. For replacing piezoelectric transducers with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for the surface inspection of metal materials, this article proposes a new magnet and coil combination consisting of a periodic-permanent-magnet (PPM) and a returned dislocation meander line coil. The returned dislocation meander line coil was developed using a traditional meander line coil, whose wires return from one side to another and shift for a certain distance. A 2-D finite-element simulation was conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed Rayleigh wave EMAT. The simulation results revealed that, compared with a large conventional magnet, the PPM increased the maximum magnetic flux density, and made the magnetic flux density distribution more concentrated on the specimen's surface, particularly below the coil. In the middle part of the coil, the PPM greatly increased the intensity of the horizontal magnetic field. Additionally, the returned dislocation meander line coil made full use of the strong magnetic field below the center of each small magnet and at the adjacent magnets.

The cavity depth is designed to ensure that its open end achieves a considerably smaller acoustic impedance than the surrounding PMUT cells. The interference acoustic wave generated between every two adjacent PMUT cells at the near surface of the array will take an easy path down to the cavity bottom.

To study this, TRPV4-, Piezo1-, or Piezo2-specific siRNAs were transfected into cultured primary chondrocytes to knock down (KD) TRPV4, Piezo1, or Piezo2 expression, designated TRPV4-KD, Piezo1-KD, or Piezo2-KD cells.

Specifically, a microwell is embedded at the bottom of the disk -shaped TPoS resonator, while a very thin layer of parylene covering the backside of the resonator and the microwell forms an isolation layer between the liquid and the top device-layer features. In this way, the liquid is in contact with the backside of the resonator, while the device-defining trenches and the electrical connections to the resonator stay clear, thus mitigating the acoustic energy loss and undesirable feedthroughs. The impact of the parylene layer thickness on a few symmetric ( S ) and antisymmetric ( A ) Lamb wave modes of the resonator is experimentally studied, and the performance of such modes in the liquid is characterized by filling the microwells through a PDMS-based microfluidic channel.

{"title": "On the piezotronic behaviours of wurtzite core-shell nanowires.", "abstract": "The piezotronic behaviours of wurtzite core-shell nanowires (NWs) are studied in this paper by using a multiscale modelling technique. A difference between piezopotentials obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and finite element calculations indicates that due to the influence of small-scale effects the widely used conventional electromechanical theory is not accurate in describing the piezopotential properties of the present core-shell NWs. Although the residual strains intrinsically existing in core-shell NWs and the structural reconstruction at their surface and interface both account for these small-scale effects, the latter is found to play the dominate role, which makes the material properties of core-shell NWs significantly depend on their geometric size. A novel core-interface-shell-surface model is proposed here to analytically describe the size dependence of the material properties and thus the small-scale effects on the piezopotential of core-shell NWs. Besides possessing a good piezoelectric performance, our density functional theory calculations also show that the core-shell NWs under external loading can retain the semiconducting properties, which confirms the existence of piezotronic effects in them. However, owing to the intrinsic asymmetric Schottky barriers at the source and drain contacts induced by residual piezopotentials in core-shell NWs, the piezotronic effects of core-shell NWs are different to those of their conventional single-component counterparts. The superb piezopotential properties and unique piezotronic behaviours observed in wurtzite core-shell NWs make them good candidates for high performance components in novel piezotronic nanodevices.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2019-11-19", "authors": ["JinZhang"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab5881"}

Furthermore, in recent years hBN crystals have become the material of choice for encapsulating other 2D crystals in a variety of technological applications, from optoelectronic and tunneling devices to composites. Monolayer hBN, which has no center of symmetry, is predicted to exhibit piezoelectric properties, yet experimental evidence is lacking. Here, by using electrostatic force microscopy, this effect is observed as a strain-induced change in the local electric field around bubbles and creases, in agreement with theoretical calculations. No piezoelectricity is found in bilayer and bulk hBN, where the center of symmetry is restored. These results add piezoelectricity to the known properties of monolayer hBN, which makes it a desirable candidate for novel electromechanical and stretchable optoelectronic devices, and pave a way to control the local electric field and carrier concentration in van der Waals heterostructures via strain.

{"title": "The Basic Physics of Waves, Soundwaves, and Shockwaves for Erectile Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) has emerged as a treatment modality for erectile dysfunction (ED). To better appreciate the differences between the various devices for the treatment of ED, it is imperative for physicians to understand the underlying physics of the different shockwave generators.\nIn this article, we explain the physics of shockwaves by establishing a foundation regarding the basics of waves, specifically soundwaves. We also describe the different shockwave generators available and assess their potential clinical utility.\nWe reviewed basic principles of wave propagation, randomized controlled trials investigating Li-ESWT for ED and other medical diseases, and individual industry shockwave generator websites, in order to describe the basic physics underlying Li-ESWT.\nWe primarily aimed to describe the physics underlying shockwave generators and to provide a framework for understanding the relevant subtypes and adjustable parameters.\nA wave is a disturbance in a medium that transports energy without permanently transporting matter. In shockwaves, a soundwave is generated with a speed faster than the local speed of sound. Shockwaves are classically generated by three different types of energy sources: electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, or piezoelectric, which all create a shockwave through the conversion of electric potential energy to mechanical energy. Importantly, radial pressure waves do not behave the same as conventional shockwaves and are more like \"ordinary\" sound waves in that they achieve a significantly lower peak pressure, a slower rise time, and propagate outwards without a focal point.\nLi-ESWT is not currently approved by the\u00a0U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is considered investigational in the United States. However, it is currently available to patients under clinical trial protocols and it is important to understand the basic physics of shockwaves to understand the differences between the different shockwave devices.\nThis is a comprehensive review of the physics underlying Li-ESWT but only tangentially explores the biological impact of shockwaves.\nPhysicians currently using or those contemplating purchasing a Li-ESWT device should understand the basic physics underlying the device, as well as which treatment protocols were used to demonstrate clinical efficacy in treating ED.

The gels were particularly designed in order to obtain a formulation suitable for administration on the skin to treat melanoma. The polymer concentration was selected after rheological characterization and determination of gel transition temperature. In order to study the gallic acid diffusion, in vitro experiments were performed using Franz cells associated to different membranes. As first approach the gallic acid diffusion was evaluated through synthetic membranes, such as cellulose, nylon, polycarbonate, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride and the commercial Strat-M\u00ae membrane. The membranes were employed separately or in association and compared to stratum corneum epidermis membranes, in order to find a system able to reproduce the gallic acid diffusion through the skin. Selected membranes were used for studying gallic acid diffusion from poloxamer gel. It was found that the diffusion of gallic acid was dramatically influenced by the type of membrane, both in the case of the aqueous solution or poloxamer gel.

Fe-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) are good materials for catalytic degradation of TCE but still face severe challenges including easy fouling, agglomeration, deactivation and difficult separation and reuse etc. To overcome these drawbacks, we have constructed a novel structured PVDF/Fe-Pd NPs composite membrane with nanosized surface pores to execute the TCE degradation. Results indicate the degradation shows pseudo first-order reaction kinetics and high degradation rate in the static state degradation. Furthermore, the degradation ability can be enhanced by increasing Fe and Pd contents, the degradation temperature or decreasing the degradation pH value. However, the degradation is essentially limited by the diffusion. Thus, the cross-flow degradation is further applied to promote the diffusion. By this operating model, the degradation ability of the composite membrane can be greatly improved. More importantly, the reactants always keep the purity in the membrane surface side and can be controlled to enter the membrane pore for catalytic degradation. Thus, products can be timely discharged via the membrane pores and the side reactions between reactants and products can be largely reduced. In addition, the nanosized surface pores can also prevent the Fe-Pd NPs from being fouled. In a word, the novel composite membrane shows strong degradation ability, good stability and convenient operating ability for the TEC catalytic degradation.", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2019-11-13", "authors": ["XiaoluHou", "XiChen", "ShiyinBi", "KunLi", "ChenghaoZhang", "JianzuWang", "WangqingZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135030"}

{"title": "Membrane ageing in full-scale water treatment plants.", "abstract": "Membrane filtration is a rapidly expanding choice for drinking water treatment. Unfortunately, there is limited data on long-term changes in the membranes' performance as they age. The present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics for hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membranes that ranged in age from 8 full-scale drinking water treatment plants. Membranes were harvested by plant operators regularly and analyzed using standardized laboratory tests. Approximately half of the membranes were a new PVDF-based chemistry. These were observed to have insignificant changes in performance factors and chemical characteristics since their beginning of operation. However, because these membranes were newer, only data for the first 5 years of operation was available. The other half of the membranes, with an older PVDF-based chemistry, were observed to have stable behaviour until approximately 5 years of operation; after this time, performance factors and chemical characteristics of the membranes began to change significantly. For these membranes, the clean water resistance and fouling rate increased after 5 years of operation. The mechanical properties of these membranes also deteriorated after 5 years of operation, suggesting that their susceptibility to breach is higher after prolonged use. These changes in performance factors paralleled, and were possibly caused by, the removal of hydrophilic additives from the membrane material. Clean water resistance was identified as a good benchmark for all the parameters studied, a finding that is useful for water treatment facilities in quickly assessing the status of their membranes. Finally, although cumulative exposure dose (C*t) was not used as a metric of membrane age, we observed that when higher doses of hypochlorite were applied, all metrics changed faster than expected based only on years of operation. Therefore, limiting the magnitude of the cumulative hypochlorite dose is essential in managing membrane deterioration.

However, most heart-on-a-chips are not developed for online and continuous monitoring of contractile behavior, which are the main functional characteristics of cardiac tissue. In this study, we designed and investigated on a heart-on-a-chip platform that provides online monitoring of contractile behavior of a 3D cardiac tissue construct. The contractile behavior include contraction force, frequency, and synchronization. They can be evaluated by an image processing system and a piezoelectric sensing system simultaneously. Based on the deformation of a micro-pillar array embedded within the 3D cardiac tissue upon subjected to cardiac contraction, the image processing system provides in situ multi-site detection of the contractile behavior. At the same time, the piezoelectric sensing system measures the contractile behavior of the entire cardiac tissue construct. A 3D cardiac tissue construct was successfully fabricated. Then the heart-on-a-chip platform was validated by applying various motion patterns on the micro-pillars, which mimicked the contraction patterns of the 3D cardiac tissue. The drug reactivity of the 3D cardiac tissue construct after a treatment of isoproterenol and doxorubicin was evaluated by measuring the contractile behavior via the image processing and the piezoelectric sensing systems.

The proposed backing layer is composed of multiple blocks operated by a phase inversion technique. Inside the proposed backing layer, the phase of the reflected signals can be canceled by adjusting acoustic impedance, piezoelectric layer contact area, and thickness of each block constituting the backing layer. Therefore, the total thickness of the backing layer can be significantly reduced while maintaining the performance. Using finite element analysis (FEA) simulation, its performance was verified based on an 8-MHz linear array transducer. Two types of bulk-type backing layers with different thicknesses were also simulated to compare the performance of the proposed method. In the case of a narrow bandwidth signal without the matching layers, the 10-mm-thick bulk-type backing layer yielded a -6-dB bandwidth of 37.2%. When its thickness was reduced to 2 mm, the -6-dB bandwidth was decreased to 17.3% due to the reflected back-wall signals. However, the -6-dB bandwidth of the proposed backing layer with 2-mm thickness was 39.5%, which is similar to the thick bulk-type backing layer. In the case of broad bandwidth signal with the matching layers, the proposed transducer also exhibits similar performance compared with the thick bulk-type backing layer. The narrow bandwidth signal was experimentally implemented by using a prototype array transducer with the proposed technique, and the performance was similar to the simulation.

{"title": "Direct contact ultrasound for fouling control and flux enhancement in air-gap membrane distillation.", "abstract": "Air Gap Membrane distillation (AGMD) is a thermally driven separation process capable of treating challenging water types, but its low productivity is a major drawback. Membrane fouling is a common problem in many membrane treatment systems, which exacerbates AGMD's low overall productivity. In this study, we investigated the direct application of low-power ultrasound (8-23\u202fW), as an in-line cleaning and performance boosting technique for AGMD. Two different highly saline feedwaters, namely natural groundwater (3970\u202f\u03bcS/cm) and RO reject stream water (12760\u202f\u03bcS/cm) were treated using Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations are presented, showing that the applied ultrasonic power range only produced acoustic streaming effects that enhanced cleaning and mass transfer. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) analysis showed that ultrasound was capable of effectively removing silica and calcium scaling. Ultrasound application on a fouled membrane resulted in a 100% increase in the permeate flux. Cleaning effects accounted for around 30-50% of this increase and the remainder was attributed to mass transfer improvements. Contaminant rejection percentages were consistently high for all treatments (>99%), indicating that ultrasound did not deteriorate the membrane structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the membrane surface was used to confirm this observation. The images of the membrane surface demonstrated that ultrasound successfully cleaned the previously fouled membrane, with no signs of structural damage. The results of this study highlight the efficient and effective application of direct low power ultrasound for improving AGMD performance.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2019-11-02", "authors": ["OsamahNaji", "Raed AAl-Juboori", "LesBowtell", "AllaAlpatova", "NoreddineGhaffour"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2019.104816"}

The aim of this prospective clinical study was to analyze the outcomes using an ultrasonic bone scalpel versus a piezoelectric surgical device and the conventional technique in a Le Fort I osteotomy.\nWe designed a prospective, randomized, single-blind cohort study. The predictor variables were the devices used to perform the Le Fort I osteotomy, divided into 3 groups: 1) ultrasonic bone scalpel (BoneScalpel; Misonix, Farmingdale, NY), 2) piezoelectric surgical device, and 3) conventional technique (Lindeman burr and reciprocal saw). The primary outcome of the study was cutting time, whereas secondary outcomes were length of the procedure, total blood loss, intraoperative complications, and postoperative edema. Other variables of interest were age and gender. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nThe study sample was composed of 34 patients with a mean age of 21.5\u00a0years, and 63.3% of patients were women. The mean cutting time (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and length of the procedure (P\u00a0=\u00a0.012) were significantly shorter with the bone scalpel than with the other types of surgery. The ultrasonic bone scalpel showed a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss of up to 45% compared with the piezoelectric surgical device and the conventional technique (P\u00a0=\u00a0.038).\nThe results of this study suggest that the ultrasonic bone scalpel is an effective ultrasonic bone-cutting instrument in a Le Fort I osteotomy as evidenced by the significant decrease in the cutting time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative edema compared with the other techniques.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2019-11-02", "authors": ["Ahmet EminDemirbas", "SuheybBilge", "SelinCelebi", "N\u00fckhetK\u00fct\u00fck", "AlperAlkan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2019.09.021"}

Part 1.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze pulpal temperature increase generated by prosthodontic margin repositioning and finishing with ultrasonic and rotating instruments. The temperature changes recorded were also correlated with the residual dentin thickness.\nA sample of 32 human extracted molars was selected. The teeth were endodontically treated and prepared with prosthetic round chamfer preparation. Then, they were inserted in plaster cubes up to the cement-enamel junction, leaving the apical portion pervious for inserting the thermocouple probe. The conventional technique, which involves the use of a high-speed contra-angle handpiece, was compared with an ultrasonic method (Crown Prep, Mectron, Carasco, Italy). For margin repositioning and finishing, two walls were randomly selected for each tooth: one was included in the test group and cut with the piezoelectric instrument (Multipiezo Touch TipHolder DB2, Mectron, Carasco, Genoa, Italy), the other one was inserted in the control group and cut with the high speed contra-angle handpiece (Kavo, Biberach, Germany). To standardize the operator-dependent parameters, it was used a mechanical arm controlled by a computer. These parameters were the pressure exerted on the dental wall, the cutting length and the time required for margin repositioning and finishing. For both test and control group, test phase consisted in a first stage of margin repositioning using an ultrasound tip or a diamond bur with a greater granulometry (120 \u00b5m for the ultrasound tip and 125 \u00b5m for the diamond bur), followed by a second finishing step conducted by an ultrasound tip or a diamond bur with smaller granulometry (60 \u00b5m for the ultrasound tip and 30 \u00b5m for the diamond bur). During these stages the intrapulpal temperature was recorded thanks to a thermocouple. Before and after these steps, the thickness of the remaining dental walls was measured with a caliber.\nThe average pulpal temperature increase was 5.03\u00b10.98 \u00b0C for the ultrasonic preparation (test group) and 3.55\u00b10.95 \u00b0C for the conventional technique (control group). The difference was statistically significant (P value <0.001). However, neither of the instruments reached the critical level of 5.5 \u00b0C reported in the literature. The mean initial dentin thicknesses was 1.82\u00b10.47 mm for the control group and 1.59\u00b10.54 mm for the test group but the analysis of the residual dentin thicknesses revealed a greater reduction of the walls worked up with high speed contra-angle handpiece (mean 0.9\u00b10.5 mm), which was therefore more aggressive than the ultrasonic instrument (mean 1.1\u00b10.5 mm). A very weak negative correlation was present between the thickness of the wall at baseline and the increment of temperature.\nWithin limitations of this study, temperature increasing of ultrasonic instruments shows a statistical difference related to rotary ones. But, as literature shows, the ultrasonic advantages are margin precision, preservation of soft tissues and reduction of operating times. Furthermore, in relation with results of this study, they could be considered safe for pulp vitality because the increase in pulpal temperature is similar to traditional instruments and it does not exceed the critical level of 5.5 \u00b0C.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2019-10-22", "authors": ["DomenicoBaldi", "JacopoColombo", "MassimoRobiony", "MariaMenini", "ElisaBisagni", "PaoloPera"], "doi": "10.23736/S0026-4970.19.04279-1"}

Long-term GDM dynamic fouling experiments operated for 30 days using sewage wastewater as feed solution indicated zwitterionic polymer modified membrane exhibit excellent membrane fouling resistance thus enhanced stable flux. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging implied that zwitterionic polymer modification significantly inhibit the adsorption of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which dominates fouling propensity, resulting in the formation of a thin biofilm with high porosity under synthetic functions of foulants deposition and microbial activities.

Grinding experiments in simulation of dental adjustment were conducted using a computer-assisted high-speed dental handpiece and coarse diamond burs. A piezoelectric force dynamometer and a high-speed data acquisition system were used for on-processing monitoring for assessment of grinding forces and energy.

Both ZLS and LDGC debris were micro fractured particles but the former were smaller than the latter due to the finer microstructure of ZLS. Ground ZLS surfaces contained more irregular microchipping and microfracture in comparison with LDGC surfaces with intergranular fracture or grain dislodgement. Grinding-induced edge chipping damage remained a serious issue for both ZLS and LDGC, which depths ranged approximately 20-100\u202f\u03bcm and significantly increased with the material removal rate (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). As the zirconia-reinforcement in ZLS only slightly reduced edge chipping damage (p\u202f>\u202f0.05), continued efforts are required to explore new reinforcement technologies for optimized LDGC.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2019-10-07", "authors": ["Xing-PengChen", "Zhong-XiaXiang", "Xiao-FeiSong", "LingYin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103435"}

However, the availability of noninvasive approaches to assess congestion is limited. Noninvasive venous waveform analysis (NIVA) uses a unique physiologic signal, the morphology of the venous waveform, to assess intracardiac filling pressures. This study is a proof of concept analysis of the correlation between NIVA value and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and the ability of the NIVA value to predict PCWP > 18 mmHg in subjects undergoing elective right heart catheterization (RHC). PCWP was also compared across common clinical correlates of congestion.\nA prototype NIVA device, which consists of a piezoelectric sensor placed over the skin on the volar aspect of the wrist, connected to a data-capture control box, was used to collect venous waveforms in 96 patients during RHC. PCWP was collected at end-expiration by an experienced cardiologist. The venous waveform signal was transformed to the frequency domain (Fourier transform), where a ratiometric algorithm of the frequencies of the pulse rate and its harmonics was used to derive a NIVA value. NIVA values were successfully captured in 83 of 96 enrolled patients. PCWP ranged from 4-40 mmHg with a median of 13 mmHg. NIVA values demonstrated a linear correlation with PCWP (r\u202f=\u202f0.69, P < 0.05).\nThis observational proof-of-concept study using a prototype NIVA device demonstrates a moderate correlation between NIVA value and PCWP in patients undergoing RHC.

{"title": "Synergistic effects of the alternating application of low and high frequency ultrasound for particle synthesis in microreactors.", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is a promising method to address clogging and mixing issues in microreactors (MR). So far, low frequency US (LFUS), pulsed LFUS and high frequency US (HFUS) have been used independently in MR for particle synthesis to achieve narrow particle size distributions (PSD). In this work, we critically assess the advantages and disadvantages of each US application method for the case study of calcium carbonate synthesis in an ultrasonic microreactor (USMR) setup operating at both LFUS (61.7\u202fkHz, 8\u202fW) and HFUS (1.24\u202fMHz, 1.6\u202fW). Furthermore, we have developed a novel approach to switch between LFUS and HFUS in an alternating manner, allowing us to quantify the synergistic effect of performing particle synthesis under two different US conditions. The reactor was fabricated by gluing a piezoelectric plate transducer to a silicon microfluidic chip. The results show that independently applying HFUS and LFUS produces a narrower PSD compared to silent conditions. However, at lower flow rates HFUS leads to agglomerate formation, while the reaction conversion is not enhanced due to weak mixing effects. LFUS on the other hand eliminates particle agglomerates and increases the conversion due to the strong cavitation effect. However, the required larger power input leads to a steep temperature rise in the reactor and the risk of reactor damage for long-term operation. While pulsed LFUS reduces the temperature rise, this application mode leads again to the formation of particle agglomerates, especially at low LFUS percentage. The proposed application mode of switching between LFUS and HFUS is proven to combine the advantages of both LFUS and HFUS, and results in particles with a unimodal narrow PSD (one order of magnitude reduction in the average size and span compared to silent conditions) and negligible rise of the reactor temperature.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2019-09-30", "authors": ["ZhengyaDong", "Aniket PradipUdepurkar", "SimonKuhn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2019.104800"}

To measure the ambient noise of the ocean, the self-noise of the hydrophone should be much less than the sea state zero (SS0) noise. Hence, an experimental setup is required to measure the self-noise generated by the hydrophones. An experimental setup has been designed, developed, and demonstrated. The facility consists of a vibration-isolated and EMI-shielded vacuum chamber which encloses the sample holder assembly and effectively isolates the test hydrophones from external environmental noise sources, such as ground vibrations, electromagnetic interference, and airborne acoustic noises. This enables the measurement of self-noise that is originating purely within the hydrophone. A procedure is developed to remove the noise contribution of the preamplifier including its resistors from the measured output signal of the preamplifier. Uncertainty in measurement using this setup is estimated using the propagation of distribution method through Monte Carlo simulation. This article describes the factors contributing to the self-noise in piezoelectric (PE) transducers, the noise measurement principle, the constructional details of the experimental setup, and the calibration procedure. The technique is demonstrated by measuring the self-noise of a few different types of hydrophones.

Structural and cellular adjustments occur in the uterine vasculature during pregnancy to accommodate this increased blood flow through a complex adaptive process that is dependent on multiple coordinated and interactive influences and this process is known as \"vascular remodeling.\" The etiology of preeclampsia involves aberrant placentation and vascular remodeling leading to reduced uteroplacental perfusion. The placental ischemia leads to development of hypertension and proteinuria in the mother, intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal death in the fetus. However, the underlying source of the deficient vascular remodeling and the subsequent development of preeclampsia remain to be fully understood. Mechanoreceptors in the vascular system convert mechanical force (shear stress) to biochemical signals and feedback mechanisms. This review focuses on the Piezo 1 channel, a mechanosensitive channel that is sensitive to shear stress in the endothelium; it induces Ca2+ entry which is linked to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation as the mechanoreceptor responsible for uterine vascular dilatation during pregnancy. Here we describe the downstream signaling pathways involved in this process and the possibility of a deficiency in expression of Piezo 1 in preeclampsia leading to the abnormal vascular dysfunction responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease. The Piezo 1 ion channel is expressed in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of small-diameter arteries.

The hysteresis frequency dependence of ferroelectric materials has been well studied. However, the long-term dynamic behavior including aging has not been well documented due to the long time frame required to gather experimental data, but it is critical for understanding the lifespan of these materials in application. Previous work has shown that the hysteresis frequency dependence of dielectric properties can be accurately modeled in the time domain using fractional derivative operators applied on a large frequency bandwidth. Currently, the lowest frequencies tested have been restrained to the hysteresis cycle quasi-static threshold. Below this threshold, the hysteresis shape remains unchanged.

It generated a 71-kHz flexural standing wave along the length. A 0.9-mm-thick thixotropic gel film made from silicone oil and hydrophobic fumed silica was formed on the glass substrate. The ultrasound vibration decreased the film viscosity, and its surface profile could be changed by the acoustic radiation force acting from the gel to the surrounding air, generated by the flexural vibration of the substrate. The transient response of the surface profile was observed by switching the ultrasound excitation ON and OFF. When the excitation was switched OFF, the gel displacement gradually decreased, but the surface profile did not return to that of the initial steady state, indicating that the viscosity recovered in time to preserve the surface profile.

We propose a novel strategy to stimulate cells at the implant site by utilizing piezoelectric ceramics as electrical stimulation sources.

BCZT exhibits low cytotoxicity with human osteoblast and endothelial cells as well as high piezoelectric responses.

The left or right ulnar nerve was stimulated at the wrist in TOF mode with 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA stimulating current intensities with both devices in random order. The TOF-Watch used standard electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes (Red Dot; 3M Health Care) for nerve stimulation. The stimulating surface area of 1 ECG electrode is 113 mm. The piezoelectric probe was attached to the thumb, and a hand adapter was used to ensure consistency of AMG measurements. The TetraGraph uses proprietary surface strip electrodes for nerve stimulation and muscle action potential recording, whose stimulating surface area is roughly twice as big as that of standard ECG electrodes (228.5 mm). The volunteers were asked to rate the discomfort associated with neurostimulation on a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) score anchored with 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain ever experienced).

We assessed the effects of piezoelectric actuators generating mechanical noise on the vibration perception threshold (VPT) at the plantar side of the foot in people with diabetic neuropathy.\nDouble-blind within-subjects design in a controlled laboratory setting including participants with diabetic neuropathy (N = 40; 18 male; mean age 69.6\u2009years; mean duration of diabetes 14.1\u2009years; mean BMI 30.5). VPT was measured at three plantar foot locations with and without mechanical noise applied via piezoelectric actuators.\nMechanical noise improved VPT at metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) 1 (left 39.3V vs 43.5V; right 39.0 vs 42.6 V), MTP5 (left 37.5V vs 41.7V; right 34.5V vs 40.8V) and the heel (left 40.0V vs 44.0V; right 39.3V vs 41.0V), all \nMechanical noise improves VPT at the plantar side of the foot in people with diabetic neuropathy. This is an important step for further development of insoles using mechanical noise that may have the potential to improve VPT and decrease the risk of foot ulceration.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes science and technology", "date": "2018-10-18", "authors": ["Jennefer B JZwaferink", "Juha MHijmans", "Claudia MSchrijver", "Laura KSchrijver", "KlaasPostema", "Jaap Jvan Netten"], "doi": "10.1177/1932296818804552"}
{"title": "Novel method of intraoperative ocular movement monitoring using a piezoelectric device: experimental study of ocular motor nerve activating piezoelectric potentials (OMNAPP) and clinical application for skull base surgeries.", "abstract": "Intraoperative monitoring systems that utilize various evoked potentials for the detection and/or preservation of cranial nerves have become increasingly common due to recent technical and commercial developments, particularly during skull base surgeries. We established a novel system for the intraoperative monitoring of the extraocular motor nerves (eOMNs) using a piezoelectric device capable of detecting imperceptible vibrations induced by ocular movement, with sensors placed on the eyelids alone. We first evaluated the efficacy and reliability of this device for the intraoperative monitoring of eOMNs in two Beagle dogs. Based on the results, we then determined the appropriate stimulation parameters for use in human surgical cases involving removal of various skull base tumors. Animal experiments revealed that a 0.4\u00a0mA monopolar electrical stimulation was required to elicit significant responses and that these responses were not inferior to those obtained via the electrooculogram/electromyogram. Significant responses were also detected in preliminary clinical investigations in human patients, following both direct and indirect monopolar electrical stimulation of the oculomotor and abducens nerves, although obtaining responses from the trochlear nerve was difficult. Intraoperative monitoring using a piezoelectric device provides a simple and reliable method for detecting eOMNs, especially the oculomotor and abducens nerves. This monitoring system can be adapted to various surgeries for skull base tumor.", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "date": "2018-09-14", "authors": ["KiyohikoSakata", "KeikoSuematsu", "NobuyukiTakeshige", "YuiNagata", "KimihikoOrito", "NaohisaMiyagi", "NaokiSakai", "TsunekazuKoseki", "MotohiroMorioka"], "doi": "10.1007/s10143-018-1028-z"}
