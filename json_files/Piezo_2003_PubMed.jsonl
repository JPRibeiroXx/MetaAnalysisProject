Two separate nonlinear gains, together with an unknown linear dynamical system, construct the nonlinear model (NM) of the piezoelectric actuator systems. A nonlinear inverse control (NIC) according to the learned NM is then designed to compensate the hysteretic phenomenon and to track the reference input without the risk of discontinuous response. Because the uncertainties are dynamic, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with residue compensation is employed to model them in a compact subset.

{"title": "A novel dual-impedance-analysis EQCM system--investigation of bovine serum albumin adsorption on gold and platinum electrode surfaces.", "abstract": "Both quartz crystal micro-balance (QCM) impedance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods are widely used in interface studies. This paper presents details about a new strategy for simultaneous, mutual-interference-free and accurate measurements of QCM impedance and EI, through connecting a suitable capacitance in series with the piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) between QCM impedance and EIS measurement instruments. Combined and individual measurements of QCM impedance and EIS during silver deposition gave results comparable with each other, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption on gold and platinum electrodes in Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffers was investigated, and the Fe(CN)6(3-)/Fe(CN)6(4-) couple was used as an electrochemical probe to characterize BSA adsorption. While the reversibility of Fe(CN)6(3-)/Fe(CN)6(4-) couple on bare Au and Pt electrodes changed very slightly with decreasing solution pH from pH approximately 7 to pH approximately 2, the standard rate constant (ks) of this couple increased abruptly with solution pH below pH approximately 4.5 at a BSA-modified Au electrode, but decreased with solution pH at a BSA-modified Pt electrode. By analyzing the QCM impedance data with a modified BVD equivalent circuit and the EI data with a modified Randle's equivalent circuit, inflexion changes at pH approximately 4.5 were all found at pH-dependent responses of the resonant frequency, the double-layer capacitance, the capacitance of the adsorbed BSA layer, the peak-absorbance values of BSA solutions at 277.5 and 224.5 nm, and so on. It was also found that a BSA adsorption layer can effectively inhibit gold corrosion during ferrocyanide oxidation in a ferrocyanide-containing BR solution. Some preliminary explanations of these findings have been given.

The A-bands were prepared by selective removal of thin filaments from rabbit skeletal glycerinated myofibrils under optical microscope with the use of gelsolin (a severing and barbed (B)-end capping protein of FA) that was prepared from bovine serum. A polystyrene bead of 1 microm in diameter attached to the B-end of FA (through a gelsolin molecule attached to the surface of the bead) was trapped and manipulated with optical tweezers. The displacement of the bead up to 200 nm (corresponding to the force of approximately 40 pN) was determined by phase-contrast image analysis. At the initial stage of this study, the overlapping length of an FA with the A-band was determined from the fluorescence image of FA labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (Rh-Ph) and the phase-contrast image, but we later improved the method of determination by moving the sample stage stepwise using the piezo actuator. The average force per overlap was subsequently estimated and the histogram was fitted with two Gaussian distributions. Each peak is supposed to correspond to the force developed by FA interacting outside or inside the A-band, and the peak value of the latter was estimated to be 140 pN/microm.

Inducing premature chromosome condensation (PCC) of injected cell nuclei in recipient cytoplasm is considered essential for successful mouse cloning by the Honolulu method. In the present study, some factors affecting PCC of rat cumulus cell nuclei injected into rat oocytes were examined. Wistar female rats (young: 4 to 5-week-old, mature: > or =10-week-old) were superovulated by injections of eCG and hCG, and oocytes recovered 14 or 17 h after hCG injection were received with cumulus cell nuclei using piezo-driven micromanipulator. When the oocytes were recovered 14 h post-hCG injection from young rats and the nuclear injection into oocytes was completed within 45 min, PCC was observed in 44-49% of NT oocytes. In the case of oocytes from mature rats, PCC occurred in 11-19% of the NT oocytes. Oocytes recovered 17 h post-hCG injection did not support PCC of the injected nuclei (0-7%) regardless of the donor age. Treatment of oocytes with a neutral cysteine protease inhibitor, N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal, slightly increased the incidence of PCC (48 vs 37%). Comparison of rat strains for oocyte donors indicated that proportions of NT oocytes undergoing PCC in Wistar and LEW oocytes (41-46%) were higher than those in Donryu and F344 oocytes (17-25%).

{"title": "Analysis of aging of piezoelectric crystal resonators.", "abstract": "Aging of piezoelectric (quartz crystal) resonator has been identified as one of the most important quality control problems of quartz crystal products. Aging is defined as frequency change with time. Aging in quartz resonators can be due to several sources: mass transfer due to contamination inside the resonator enclosure, stress-strain in the resonator blank, quartz defect, etc. In this study, the stress-strain effect, which has been believed as a dominant factor contributing to aging, is studied. The stress-strain effect is caused mainly by the long-term viscoelastic properties of bonding adhesive that attach quartz crystal plate to the ceramic base package. With the available accelerating testing method under elevated temperatures, the stress-strain induced aging in the quartz crystal resonators can be investigated. Because of the miniaturized size of the resonator, a digital image analysis method called image intensity matching technique (IIMT) is applied to obtain deformation patterns in the quartz blank due to thermal load. Our preliminary results showed that the unsymmetric thermal deformations may be a dominant contributing factor to aging. For simulation purposes, finite-element analysis is used to investigate the deformation patterns (i.e., stress-strain distributions) and corresponding natural frequency shift in the piezoelectric resonators. The viscoelastic behavior of mounting adhesives is incorporated into the analysis to show the dominant effect of long-term behavior of stress-strain developed in the crystal resonators.

An experimental study is presented on the power required to reach tactile thresholds in electromechanical and piezo-electric transducers. Three different waveforms are considered, with an excitatory period formed by a burst of rectangular 50% duty cycle pulses (R50), rectangular low duty cycle pulses (RLO) and sinusoidal pulses (SIN). Ten different pulse repetition periods (RPs) were considered in the range 1/550-1/25 s.

The elasticity version of the leading-order equation is the same as that of the classical Kirchhoff inhomogeneous plate theory and, therefore, is easily solvable. By contrast, it is not straightforward to find solutions of the higher-order equations. The solvability condition is thus established for this purpose, by which higher-order frequency parameters are derived. The present theoretical formulation is examined by comparing the present asymptotic results with an exact three-dimensional solution for a piezoelectric bimorph strip, and excellent agreement is reached.

In such a piezoelectric plate with an inversion layer, even-order thickness-extensional modes, as well as odd-order modes, can be excited piezoelectrically. Therefore, the ultrasonic transducer using such a piezoelectric plate is expected to operate over a wide frequency range. In this paper, it is shown that broadband ultrasonic transducers can be obtained at a certain thickness ratio of inversion layer to plate, and that the transducer characteristics differ depending on whether the inversion layer is on the front side or on the backside.

Transducers of varying dimensions were built for an f# range of 2.0-3.1. The desired focal depths were achieved by either casting an acoustic lens on the transducer face or press-focusing the piezoelectric into a spherical curvature. For designs that required electrical impedance matching, a low impedance transmission line coaxial cable was used. All transducers were tested in a pulse-echo arrangement, whereby the center frequency, bandwidth, insertion loss, and focal depth were measured. Several transducers were fabricated with center frequencies in the 20-80 MHz range with the measured -6 dB bandwidths and two-way insertion loss values ranging from 57 to 74% and 9.6 to 21.3 dB, respectively. Both transducer focusing techniques proved successful in producing highly sensitive, high-frequency, single-element, ultrasonic-imaging transducers. In vivo and in vitro ultrasonic backscatter microscope (UBM) images of human eyes were obtained with the 50 MHz transducers.

It is known that, in measurements of continuous-wave (CW) fields, standing waves may be generated between the transducer and the hydrophone, distorting the field and possibly alternating the signal of the hydrophone. This study uses a three-dimensional, full-wave method to computationally simulate the distortion in the CW field caused by needle and membrane hydrophones. The physical model used in simulations is based on the linear time-harmonic wave equation, which therefore neglects the effects of nonlinear wave propagation. The significance of the distortion is examined by comparing fields emitted by 0.5-5.0 MHz planar circular transducers in the absence and presence of the hydrophones. In addition, the effect of the field distortions on the signal of the hydrophones is studied with simulated measurements. The simulations showed an observable standing wave pattern between the source and the needle hydrophone if the diameter of the needle was larger than a half of the wavelength. However, the standing waves had no clear effect on the signal of the hydrophone. The presence of membrane hydrophone in the CW field generated notable standing waves.

This article presents a modeling strategy, which allows for a quick and precise modal and forced analysis of the stator of TWUM. First-order shear deformation laminated plate theory is applied to annular subdomains (super-elements) of the stator. In addition to shear deformations, the model takes into account the effect of rotary inertia, the stiffness contribution of the teeth, and the linear varying thickness of the stator. Moreover, the formulation considers a more realistic function for the electric field inside the piezoelectric ceramic, i.e., a linear function, instead of the generally assumed constant electric field. The Ritz method is used to find an approximated solution for the dynamic equations. Finally, the modal response is obtained and compared against the results from classical simplified models and the finite element method.

{"title": "Cross-sectional compliance overestimates arterial compliance because it neglects the axial strain.", "abstract": "A high resolution echo-tracking system permits the calculation of cross-sectional compliance considering vessel diameter variations alone, and assumes that longitudinal movement of the vessel wall due to pulse pressure is negligible. However, using piezoelectric crystals sutured on the adventitia of the vessel wall we demonstrated that arterial length changes up to 5% (mean 2.7%) as a function of pulse pressure. Therefore, cross-sectional compliance seems to provide a limited approximation of the real phenomenon because it neglects axial vessel movement. Axial vessel movement is taken into account when the vessel compliance is calculated according to the principle of continuity of the mass: [equation: see text]. To verify this hypothesis we measured the blood flow gradient through 10 cm long segments of 10 pig carotid arteries (Qin - Qout) and divided it for the derivative of blood pressure over a given time (deltaP/deltat). For the same vessels, we calculated the cross-sectional compliance (CC) using the echo-tracking system (NIUS 02).

A computer simulation of the piezoelectric generator is used to compare the theoretical and experimental results. The simulation predicts that a quasi-static stress will produce a bidirectional generator output voltage, and a dynamic stress will produce a unidirectional output voltage. The simulation also predicts that, when equal stresses are applied to the generator, the dynamic stress will generate a 10X higher output voltage than the quasi-static stress, contradicting results reported by other investigators. The output voltage is different for the two cases because of the generator's resistive capacitive (RC) time constant. The dynamic stress is applied in a time that is less than the generator's RC time constant, and the quasi-static stress is applied in a time greater than the generator's RC time constant. The piezoelectric capacitance has enough time to charge in the quasi-static case, resulting in the lower output voltage.

In the present paper, a miniaturized ultrasonic transducer entirely based on fiber optic technology is proposed. Such a device springs from the conjunction between our research, which has produced a highly efficient fiber optic opto-acoustic source, with the results obtained by other researchers concerning the realization of an ultrasonic receiver based on optical interferometry. Making use of the thermo-elastic effect for ultrasound generation, a source of ultrasound can be obtained by coupling a fiber optic to pulsed laser, if a film capable of absorbing laser light is placed onto fiber end. Starting from these remarks, we propose an efficient opto-acoustic source, able to generate pressure pulses with amplitude of the order of 10(4) Pa and bandwidth extending up to 40 MHz and beyond by using graphite materials as absorbing film. This solution makes use of a low-power pulsed laser as optical source possible. An ultrasonic receiving element was realized placing a Fabry-Perot cavity over the tip of a fiber optic. The cavity thickness modulation induced by ultrasonic beam is detected by an interferometer optical technique. We have realized a prototype of a receiving device that exhibits a sensitivity comparable with that of piezoelectric devices (10-100 nV/Pa) and an almost flat bandwidth extending up to 20 MHz or more. The extreme miniaturization of the resulting ultrasonic transducer, together with its wide ultrasonic frequency bandwidth, is the first step toward ultrasonic tissue biopsy.

{"title": "Water-cooled, high-intensity ultrasound surgical applicators with frequency tracking.", "abstract": "High-intensity, focused ultrasound (HIFU) applicators have been developed for arresting bleeding with the ultimate intent of use in surgery. The design uses a tapered titanium component for transmission coupling of the ultrasound energy from a spherically curved transducer to biological tissues. The nominal operating frequency is 5.5 MHz, in a highly resonant mode (quality factor of 327 with water load). Liquid cooling is used to remove energy loss important at net applied power greater than 18 W/cm2 at the surface of the piezoelectric element. A downward resonance frequency shift (>20 kHz) occurs, even with cooling, as the applicator warms with normal operation.

In this work, we present a new bulk acoustic wave (BAW) structure consisting of Al/MgxZn1-xO/n(+)-ZnO/r-sapphire, where Al and n+ type ZnO serve as the top and bottom electrode, respectively. The epitaxial MgxZn1-xO films have the same epitaxial relationships with the substrate as ZnO on r-Al2O3, resulting in the c-axis of the MgxZn1-xO being in the growth plane. This relationship promotes shear bulk wave propagation that affords sensing in liquid phase media without the dampening effects found in longitudinal wave mode BAW devices. The BAW velocity and electromechanical coupling coefficient of MgxZn1-xO can be tailored by varying the Mg composition, which provides an alternative and complementary method to adjust the BAW characteristics by changing the piezoelectric film thickness. This provides flexibility to design the operating frequencies of thin film bulk acoustic wave devices. Frequency responses of devices with two acoustic wave modes propagating in the specified structure are analyzed using a transmission line model.

Dielectric loss and dielectric dipole movement in dry intact fibres as they undergo thermal transition above 200 degrees C show alpha-keratin to be a polar structure. X-ray diffraction has shown that this transition corresponds to the randomisation of the organised alpha-helical structure resulting in the loss of polarity of the fibre. The piezoelectric properties of alpha-keratin can only be explained if its alpha-helical dipoles in the ordered structure alpha-keratin are synergistically aligned in the axial direction. If the alpha-helical units of the IFs of alpha-keratin fibre were in an anti-parallel conformation then dry alpha-keratin would show no polarity. FTIR measurements on alpha-keratin fibres extended in water at 21 and 95 degrees C explain the formation of anti-parallel beta-structures when fibres are extended in steam.

Here we report radiation pattern measurements with a 5-microm spatial sampling, showing that the radiated acoustic field is degraded by leaky Rayleigh waves launched from the PDMS/glass interface.

The conformational behavior is further characterized by chain size distribution function, and our findings show that temperature induced conformational transition for a chain molecule can be discrete or continuous, depending on its chain length. Also, the dipolar interactions in PVDF are effectively attractive, and enhance chain contraction. As a result, when the strength of dipolar interactions is increased, the discrete conformational transition shifts toward longer chains; and for a given chain length, such a transition occurs at higher temperatures.", "journal": "Journal of molecular modeling", "date": "2003-10-01", "authors": ["YongChen", "Chwen-YangShew"], "doi": "10.1007/s00894-003-0159-4"}

The knife is a modified cryo diamond knife that is driven by a piezo translator. Optimal setting for the oscillation was found to be in the inaudible frequency range of 20-25 kHz. Yeast cells and polystyrene spheres were used as model systems to describe compression in the vitreous sections. We found that compression could be reduced by a factor of about 2 when the knife was oscillating. When the oscillator was turned off, sections were compressed by 40-45%. However, only 15-25% compression was obtained when the knife was oscillating. In some cases completely uncompressed sections of yeast cells were produced. It was also found that the amount of compression depends on the specimen itself and on its embedding medium. With the results shown here, we demonstrate that the oscillating knife can produce high-quality vitreous sections with minimum cutting artefacts.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2003-10-01", "authors": ["AAl-Amoudi", "JDubochet", "HGnaegi", "WL\u00fcthi", "DStuder"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2818.2003.01244.x"}

This bi-directional energy conversion takes place in the cell's lateral wall and resembles the direct and converse piezoelectric effects both qualitatively and quantitatively. A piezoelectric model of the lateral wall has been developed that is based on the electrical and material parameters of the lateral wall. An equivalent circuit for the outer hair cell that includes piezoelectricity shows a greater admittance at high frequencies than one containing only membrane resistance and capacitance. The model also predicts resonance at ultrasonic frequencies that is inversely proportional to cell length. These features suggest all mammals use outer hair cell piezoelectricity to support the high-frequency receptor potentials that drive electromotility. It is also possible that members of some mammalian orders use outer hair cell piezoelectric resonance in detecting species-specific vocalizations.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2003-09-30", "authors": ["Erik KWeitzel", "RonTasker", "William EBrownell"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1596172"}

A sample cut in the shape of a bar is adhered to a piezoelectric ceramic shaker and mounted vertically inside a pressure vessel equipped with glass windows. Two independent measurement methods are then used: a resonant technique, to obtain low-frequency data, and a wave propagation technique, to obtain higher-frequency data. Both techniques are implemented utilizing laser Doppler vibrometers. One vibrometer detects sample resonances through a window located at the bottom of the pressure vessel, and a set of two separate vibrometers monitors the speed of longitudinal waves propagating in the sample, through windows located on the sides of the vessel. The apparatus is contained inside an environmental chamber for temperature control. Using this approach, Young's modulus data can be obtained at frequencies typically ranging from 100 Hz to 5 kHz, under hydrostatic pressures ranging from 0 to 2.07 MPa (300 psi), and at temperatures between -2 degrees C and 50 degrees C.

{"title": "Piezoelectric sensor determination of arterial pulse wave velocity.", "abstract": "Arterial pulse wave velocity (APWV) is a measure of the elasticity (or stiffness) of peripheral arterial blood vessels. The pulse referred to here will be the pressure pulse as opposed to the flow pulse measured by ultrasound Doppler. The pressure pulse velocity varies over the range from about 12 m s(-1) to 15 m s(-1) in stiff peripheral arteries, whereas in normal arteries it has a velocity in the range of 7 to 9 m s(-1). The aim of this project was the development of a fast and easy to use system for the determination of peripheral arterial pulse wave velocity. The principle of the PWV measurement is based on simultaneous measurement of two pulse waves at two different positions, such as the radial artery at the wrist and the brachial artery just above the elbow. By determining the pulse transit time between these points and the distance measured between the two locations, pulse wave velocity may then be calculated. The pressure pulse detection is done by using two piezoelectric sensors which generate a measurable voltage at the output contacts if they are mechanically deformed. The deformation produced voltage is first amplified and filtered and then digitalized with a data acquisition card. The analysis of the data obtained from the sensors includes a filtering process, the calculation of the PWV with three different methods--foot-to-foot, cross-correlation and peak-to-peak-and the determination of the arterial pulse rate. Extensive measurements with human test subjects were carried out to optimize the techniques of data acquisition and analysis. For example, it was found that the best procedure was to hold the sensors in place using elastic straps alone. The data analysis was upgraded with an additional software module, which deletes, in effect, outriders or invalid measurements. With the optimized system, a series involving eight test subjects ranging in age from 22 to 32 years was completed (all normotensive). The arterial pulse wave velocities determined covered a range from 6 m s(-1) to 12 m s(-1), with an average standard deviation of less than 2.5 m s(-1) for individual results. These are slightly higher, but close to published APWV data.

This study assessed transducer performance in anesthetized, acutely implanted cats using computer-averaged, laser-Doppler vibrometer measures and cochlear potentials.\nMeasures of output linearity and distortion for a transducer placed on the umbo were obtained from averaged laser-Doppler vibrometer outputs. Frequency response and equivalent sound pressure level for transducers placed against the stapes were estimated by comparing compound action potentials and cochlear microphonics elicited preoperatively by acoustic signals with responses elicited postoperatively by signals presented through transducers.\nThe transducer placed on the umbo exhibited an effective bandwidth that exceeded 8 kHz, linear response behavior for driving voltages up to 2 Vrms, and harmonic distortion of -40 dB or better at all frequencies greater than 250 Hz. Except for a shorter latency, transducer-elicited cochlear potentials were indistinguishable from acoustically elicited responses. Frequency response varied widely across transducers, ranging from reasonably flat to possessing a bandpass characteristic with a peak at 2 to 4 kHz; 1-Vrms signals applied to transducers with various geometries yielded equivalent intensities of 62 to 108 dB sound pressure level at 4 kHz, 51 to 98 dB sound pressure level at 2 kHz, and 55 to 80 dB sound pressure level at 1 kHz. Differences in frequency response and equivalent sound pressure level stemmed from different resonance frequencies in transducers with dissimilar lengths and, more importantly, from variation in transducer-stapes contact force.\nAppropriately designed piezoelectric transducers can provide the cochlea with high-fidelity, wide-bandwidth signals. However, using them in implantable hearing aids requires that geometry and contact force be optimized to reduce variability in output level.

At the upper end, it is capable of detecting much larger masses bound to the surface. These can be complex arrays of biopolymers and biomacromolecules, even whole cells. In addition, the QCM can provide information about the energy dissipating properties of the bound surface mass. Another important and unique feature of the technique is the ability to measure mass and energy dissipation properties of films while simultaneously carrying out electrochemistry on solution species or upon film systems bound to the upper electrode on the oscillating quartz crystal surface. These measurements can describe the course of electropolymerization of a film or can reveal ion or solute transport within a film during changes in the film environment or state, including the oxidation state for an electroactive film driven by the underlying surface potential. The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in the application of the QCM technique to the study of a wide range of molecular systems at the solution-surface interface, in particular, biopolymer and biochemical systems. In this report, we start with a brief historical and technical overview.

{"title": "Axial compression generated by cortical and cancellous lag screws in the equine distal phalanx.", "abstract": "Lag screw fixation using single 4.5 mm cortical bone screws is a recommended technique for repair of mid-sagittal plane fractures of the distal phalanx in adult horses. However, implant infection and technical difficulties in obtaining adequate interfragmentary compression have made this surgical procedure somewhat controversial. We hypothesized that use of larger diameter screws would result in increased axial compression and improved stability of this fracture. Paired distal phalanges from the forelimbs of 10 adult horses were collected at necropsy and divided in half in the midsagittal plane. Using a randomized block study design, four types of bone screws (4.5 mm cortical, 5.5 mm cortical, 6.5 mm cancellous pre-tapped, and 6.5 mm cancellous non-tapped) were inserted to a depth of 15 mm. During screw insertion, the axial force generated under the screw head was measured with a load washer containing a piezoelectric force transducer, while torque of insertion was recorded with a torsional testing machine. The 6.5mm screw inserted after pre-tapping generated significantly greater axial force (2781 N) than the 4.5 mm (1522 N), 5.5 mm (2073 N) or 6.5 mm non-tapped (2295 N) screws. The relationship between maximal applied torque and axial force generated was linear for each screw type. Each unit of torque applied during insertion of cortical screws resulted in a greater increase in axial compression, as compared to cancellous screws.

{"title": "New principle of direct real-time monitoring of the interaction of cholinesterase and its inhibitors by piezolectric biosensor.", "abstract": "This paper describes a new method for the sensitive detection of cholinesterase inhibitors based on real-time monitoring using a piezoelectric biosensor. The cholinesterase inhibitor paraoxon was immobilized on the sensing surface via a chelate complex as the recognition element. At first, the conjugate of N-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) with Nalpha,Nalpha-bis (carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (NTA-Lys) was chemisorbed to form a self-assembled monolayer on the surface of the gold electrode of the piezosensor. In the next step, paraoxon-spacer-hexahistidine conjugate was linked to the MUA-Lys-NTA layer via the chelate complex with Ni2+. The paraoxon-modified surface thus obtained was applied for the binding of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Regeneration of the sensing surface was achieved by splitting the chelate complex with EDTA and depositing a fresh layer of Ni2+ followed by addition of the paraoxon-spacer-hexahistidine. In the presence of free inhibitors like diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), binding of BChE to the surface-bound paraoxon was decreased. In this way, a competitive affinity assay for organophosphorus compounds was developed. The limit of detection for DFP as a model compound was 10 nmol/l (ca. 2 microg/l).

Among these, piezoelectric polymer films with thicknesses between several tens and a few hundreds of micrometers as well as coaxial cables with piezoelectric polymer layers are highly suitable and attractive for the detection of mechanical loads.

Therefore, the most common materials are nonporous piezoelectric polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or its copolymer with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)). Here, P(VDF-TrFE) polymer films as well as the operating principle and the geometry of piezoelectric polymer cables are described. As active piezoelectric cable layer, P(VDF-TrFE) (76/24) was employed. After electrical poling with one or more point-to-cable corona discharges, the polarization in the P(VDF-TrFE) layer was investigated. Poling parameters, such as electric field and poling time, were varied. The resulting polarization was characterized with measurements of polarization profiles across the film or the cable-layer thickness as well as with the determination of other electromechanical quantities.

The first step towards such a valve is development of the sensors and examination of whether sensor output provides predictive information on function. Custom-made piezo-electric sensors were mounted onto the housing of mechanical valves with various layers of simulated thrombus and bioprosthetic valves with normal and stiffened leaflets. Sensor output was examined using joint time-frequency analysis. Sensors were able to detect leaflet opening and closing with high fidelity for all types of valve. The frequency content of the closing sounds for the mechanical valves contained several peaks between 100 Hz and 10 kHz, whereas closing sounds for the bioprosthetic valve contained energy in a lower frequency range (<1 kHz). A frequency peak of 47 +/- 15 Hz was seen for the normal bioprosthetic valve; this peak increased to 115 +/- 12 Hz for the valve with visibly stiffened leaflets. Total low-frequency (80-3500 Hz) energy content diminished predictably with increasing levels of thrombus for the mechanical valves. Lastly, closing sound intensity correlated well with closing pressure dynamics (dp/dt) (y = 190x - 443; r = 0.90), indicating that the sensors also provide information on haemodynamics.

With dehydration of the cornea, a reduction in crystallinity and changes in hydrogen bonding were observed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements.

{"title": "Measuring the hydraulic conductivity of shallow submerged sediments.", "abstract": "The hydraulic conductivity of submerged sediments influences the interaction between ground water and surface water, but few techniques for measuring K have been described with the conditions of the submerged setting in mind. Two simple, physical methods for measuring the hydraulic conductivity of submerged sediments have been developed, and one of them uses a well and piezometers similar to well tests performed in terrestrial aquifers. This test is based on a theoretical analysis that uses a constant-head boundary condition for the upper surface of the aquifer to represent the effects of the overlying water body. Existing analyses of tests used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of submerged sediments may contain errors from using the same upper boundary conditions applied to simulate terrestrial aquifers. Field implementation of the technique requires detecting minute drawdowns in the vicinity of the pumping well. Low-density oil was used in an inverted U-tube manometer to amplify the head differential so that it could be resolved in the field. Another technique was developed to measure the vertical hydraulic conductivity of sediments at the interface with overlying surface water. This technique uses the pan from a seepage meter with a piezometer fixed along its axis (a piezo-seep meter). Water is pumped from the pan and the head gradient is measured using the axial piezometer. Results from a sandy streambed indicate that both methods provide consistent and reasonable estimates of K. The pumping test allows skin effects to be considered, and the field data show that omitting the skin effect (e.g., by using a single well test) can produce results that underestimate the hydraulic conductivity of streambeds.", "journal": "Ground water", "date": "2003-07-23", "authors": ["Susan EKelly", "Lawrence CMurdoch"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1745-6584.2003.tb02377.x"}

Control of this type of cavitation has been achieved by modulating the local pressure that was experienced by a nucleus present in the shear layer. This modulation was made possible by using a piezoelectric device, termed as Ultrasonic Pressure Modulator (UPM). The performance of UPM has been studied at different dissolved gas concentrations with electrolysis bubbles as nuclei. Control of cavitation due to natural nuclei has also been attempted. Efficiency of UPM, in reducing cavitation, was seen to be dependent on the driving frequency employed.

In this paper, the design and construction of an innovative ultrasonic actuator is developed as a stator, which is a composite structure consisting of piezoceramic (PZT) membrane bonded on a metal sheet. Such a concentric PZT structure possesses the electrical and mechanical coupling characteristics in flexural wave. The driving ability of the actuator comes from the mechanical vibration of extension and shrinkage of a metal sheet due to the converse piezoelectric effect, corresponding to the frequency of a single-phase AC power. By applying the constraints on the specific geometry positions on the metal sheet, the various behaviors of flexural waves have been at the different directions. The rotor is impelled by the actuator with rotational speeds of 600 rpm in maximum using a friction-contact mechanism. Very high actuating and braking abilities are obtained. This simple and inexpensive structure of actuator demonstrates that the mechanical design of actuator and rotor could be done separately and flexibly according to the requirements for various applications. And, its running accuracy and positioning precision are described in Part II.A closed loop servo positioning control i.e. sliding mode control (SMC) is used to compensate automatically for nonlinearly mechanical behaviors such as dry friction, ultrasonic vibrating, slip-stick phenomena.

{"title": "Differential responses by pancreatic carcinoma cell lines to prolonged exposure to Erbitux (IMC-C225) anti-EGFR antibody.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating disease, with 95% of all patients diagnosed with the disease dying within 2 years. The combined therapy using Erbitux, gemcitabine, and radiation caused complete tumor regression using a nude mouse model inoculated with pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cells but only a delay in tumor growth with BxPC-3. We investigated the effect of prolonged Erbitux treatment to the sensitivity to gemcitabine and/or radiation and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal transduction pathway.\nMiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells were cultured with or without Erbitux for 6 weeks. Cells were then treated with gemcitabine and/or radiation, harvested 48 h after treatment, and counted. Differences in EGFR expression after exposure to Erbitux were analyzed by FACS. Internalization rates of EGFR induced by Erbitux on these cell lines were determined using 125I-EGF binding assay after removal of Erbitux by acidic wash. Cell lysates were harvested after cells were stimulated with EGF, FGF, or IGF-1 respectively, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated using Erbitux. Samples were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membranes were probed with antibody against human growth factor receptor binding protein (Grb2) to detect the association of this Ras-MAPK upstream adaptor protein to EGFR. Cell lysates were also separated with SDS-PAGE and probed with rabbit anti-human PARP after samples were transferred to PVDF membrane. Expression of BAX and Bcl-(XL) were probed in the cells treated with or without Erbitux.\nProliferation assays indicated that prolonged exposure to Erbitux increased the sensitivities of MiaPaCa-2 to gemcitabine and radiation therapy (41 +/- 16% vs 52 +/- 9% for gemcitation, 28 +/- 9 vs 39 +/- 9% for combination; P = 0.015) but not for BxPC-3. FACS analysis showed that the expressed EGFR level decreased by about 42% on MiaPaCa 2 whereas no loss was seen on BxPC-3. Expression of BAX was upregulated on MiaPaCa-2. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage indicated the killing was mediated by apoptosis. Immunoblots showed that Grb2 was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR after EGF stimulation. Incubation with Erbitux blocked Grb2 binding in MiaPaCa-2 but not BxPC 3. FGF transactivated EGFR down stream Ras-MAPK in the presence or absence of Erbitux. Internalization of EGFR induced by Erbitux did not differ between MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3.\n1) Association of Grb2 to EGFR in BxPC-3 induced by EGF in the presence of Erbitux indicates an alternate pathway of Ras-MAPK activation, which may be related with the tumor resistance to treatment; 2) transactivation of EGFR downstream Ras-MAPK pathway by FGF contributes the resistance to treatment; and 3) downregulation of EGFR may increase the response to therapy.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2003-07-10", "authors": ["Zhi-qiangHuang", "Donald JBuchsbaum", "Kevin PRaisch", "James ABonner", "Kirby IBland", "Selwyn MVickers"], "doi": "10.1016/s0022-4804(03)00076-3"}

Being different from previous work, the effects of the stress distribution and the relative positions of input and output parts on the internal loss distribution are taken into account in this model. Using this model, the temperature rise and its distribution are calculated, and the effects of ambient temperature, internal loss distribution, size, heat dissipation coefficient, and heat conductivity of the transformer on the temperature rise are estimated. The calculated temperature rise and its distribution agree quite well with the experimental data. It is found that the allowable output power of the transformer should be reduced markedly when the ambient temperature increases to maintain a reasonable working temperature for the piezoelectric material of the transformer. It also is found that decreasing wavelength, making internal loss distribution uniform, and increasing the ratio of perimeter to area of the cross section (for example, decreasing the cross-sectional area and using a thin plate structure), decrease the temperature rise for a given internal loss per unit volume. Furthermore, it is revealed that the heat dissipation coefficient has a remarkable effect on the temperature rise at a large internal loss, and the variation in the heat conductivity of the piezoelectric material has little effect on the temperature rise.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2003-07-04", "authors": ["JunhuiHu"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2003.1209546"}

The quartz homeotypes berlinite and gallium orthophosphate (GaPO4), along with the calcium gallo-germanates such as langasite are representative of these crystals. The coupling coefficient k26 associated with thickness-shear mode resonators is two times greater than that of quartz, increasing the spacing between the series and parallel resonance frequencies of resonators suitable for the frequency range from 1 to 100 MHz. This is important for some types of crystal oscillators and monolithic filters. The large electromechanical coupling coefficient also increases the difference between the temperature dependencies of the fundamental resonance frequency and its harmonics. In this paper, measured resonance frequency-temperature characteristics of the fundamental and third harmonics of selected rotated Y-cut GaPO4 resonators vibrating in the thickness-shear mode are presented. Further attention is given to the measurement of some nonlinear properties of rotated Y-cut GaPO4 resonators.

{"title": "A novel approach for high throughput cultivation assays and the isolation of planktonic bacteria.", "abstract": "Abstract Using the MicroDrop((R)) microdispenser system, a novel approach for high throughput cultivation assays for the determination of numbers of culturable bacteria, and for the isolation of bacteria in liquid media was established. The MicroDrop device works similar to an ink jet printer. Droplets of 150-200 pl are created at the nozzle of a glass micropipette by means of a computer-driven piezo transducer, and are dispensed automatically at predetermined positions with the aid of a XYZ-positioning system. The actual drop volume is highly reproducible and is determined by the pulse duration, the pulse frequency and the micropipette geometry. Culture media in 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated with constant numbers of bacteria from three different natural freshwater lakes. The number of culturable bacteria in the sample can be calculated from the frequency of wells showing bacterial growth, based on a binomial distribution of culturable cells. Our method was compared to the conventional most probable number (MPN) approach, the technique presently most often used for the determination of bacterial culturability and for the isolation of numerically dominant culturable bacteria. As opposed to the MPN technique, our approach yields data with much higher statistical significance (i.e. a 10 times lower standard deviation) due to the higher number of parallels which can be performed in each microtiter plate. The values of culturable bacteria as determined by the MPN and MicroDrop techniques were only weakly correlated (r(2)=0.570, n=42, P<0.001). Cultivation efficiencies obtained with the MicroDrop technique were systematically lower than MPN values by a factor of 2.7, indicating a significant overestimation of culturability by the latter method. The composition of the cultured bacterial fraction was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting of 16S rDNA fragments and sequencing. This demonstrated that phylogenetically similar bacteria were recovered by both cultivation techniques. Both methods resulted in the recovery of many previously unknown aquatic bacteria affiliated to the same taxonomic groups and, in one case, in the isolation of a numerically dominant, but not-yet-cultured beta-Proteobacterium which was ubiquitous in all three lakes.", "journal": "FEMS microbiology ecology", "date": "2003-07-01", "authors": ["AlkeBruns", "HerbertHoffelner", "J\u00f6rgOvermann"], "doi": "10.1016/S0168-6496(03)00133-8"}

The N-glycans were released from PVDF-blotted HSA or CD24 and separated on Carbograph SPE into neutral and acid glycans. The naturally neutral glycan fraction and the fraction of glycans rendered neutral after neuraminidase treatment were analysed without further purification by MALDI-MS. In each fraction, about 25 molecular ions with an intensity >10% of the base peak were identified which corresponded to glycans with distinct isobaric monosaccharide compositions. Comparison of the neutral and desialylated glycans revealed some similarities between the samples analysed, but also clear differences. HSA and CD24 from all cell lines express almost no neutral N-glycans with two or more fucose in contrast to brain HSA and glycoproteins from mouse and human brain. The lack of extensive fucosylation was also observed for desialylated glycans of HSA and CD24 from all cell lines analysed except for CD24 from a human neuroblastoma cell line which exhibits like total human and mouse brain glycoproteins a large variety of highly fucosylated, higher branched N-glycans. HSA from mouse brain carries in addition desialylated non-fucosylated glycans of high abundance which were detected, if at all, only at low intensity in all other samples analysed suggesting that they may be implicated in specific functions of mouse brain HSA.

We characterized the capabilities and limitations of the probe for profiling PWS skin. The probe induced and measured photoacoustic waves in acrylamide tissue phantoms and PWS skin in vivo. The optical properties of the phantoms were chosen to mimic those of PWS skin. We denoised acoustic waves using spline wavelet transforms, then deconvolved with the impulse response of the probe to yield initial subsurface pressure distributions in phantoms and PWS skin. Using the phantoms, we determined that the limit in resolving epidermal and PWS layers was less than 70 microm. In addition, we used the phantoms to determine that the maximum epidermal melanin concentration that allowed detection of PWS was between 13 and 20%. In vivo measurements of PWS skin with different epidermal melanin concentrations correlated with the phantoms. Thus the photoacoustic probe can be used to determine PWS depth for most patients receiving laser therapy.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2003-06-07", "authors": ["John AViator", "BernardChoi", "MartinAmbrose", "JeromeSpanier", "J StuartNelson"], "doi": "10.1364/ao.42.003215"}

Using a Landau-type potential energy combined with energy minimization, we demonstrate that the dramatic property enhancement is due to the exchange coupling between the dielectrically hard P(VDF-TrFE) and dielectrically soft CuPc, which becomes dominant when the heterogeneity size of the composite is comparable to the exchange length. The exchange coupling is a very effective mechanism for the enhancement of functional properties in ferroelectric and dielectric systems, and its variation with various material parameters is demonstrated and discussed.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2003-06-06", "authors": ["JiangYuLi"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.217601"}

A polyvinylidene fluoride point-focusing transducer was driven by a 700-W pulse generator to superimpose the acoustic pulse on the sonoluminescing bubble. The center frequency of the pulse was 10 MHz and the duration was 0.15 micros. The pulse was triggered every 100 cycles of the low-frequency standing wave used to make SBSL. The intensity of SBSL was measured as a function of time lag of superimposed pulse. Only the pulse that arrived at the bubble at the early growing stage could increase the brightness. This trend was confirmed with a numerical calculation based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The increased brightness reached 300% of those of the classical SBSL flashes when the time lag was correctly adjusted.", "journal": "Physical review.

Complexation of the immobilized MT with Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions in aqueous media was followed by recording the changes of the frequency shifts of the piezoelectric quartz crystals. The amount of Cd(II) ions interacted with the immobilized MT molecules was the highest at pH 7.4, and decreased with an increase in the pH of the medium, in parallel to the decrease in the amount of immobilized MT. The number of Zn(II) ions interacted with the immobilized MT molecules was higher than the number of Cd(II) ions when the adsorption was from solutions containing a single-metal ion with the same ion concentrations. In consecutive adsorption studies, we observed that the type of metal ions used in the first interaction is important.

{"title": "Calibration of ultrasonic hydrophone probes up to 100 MHz using time gating frequency analysis and finite amplitude waves.", "abstract": "A number of ultrasound imaging systems employs harmonic imaging to optimize the trade off between resolution and penetration depth and center frequencies as high as 15 MHz are now used in clinical practice. However, currently available measurement tools are not fully adequate to characterize the acoustic output of such nonlinear systems primarily due to the limited knowledge of the frequency responses beyond 20 MHz of the available piezoelectric hydrophone probes. In addition, ultrasound hydrophone probes need to be calibrated to eight times the center frequency of the imaging transducer. Time delay spectrometry (TDS) is capable of providing transduction factor of the probes beyond 20 MHz, however its use is in practice limited to 40 MHz. This paper describes a novel approach termed time gating frequency analysis (TGFA) that provides the transduction factor of the hydrophone probes in the frequency domain and significantly extends the quasi-continuous calibration of the probes up to 60 MHz. The verification of the TGFA data was performed using TDS calibration technique (up to 40 MHz) and a nonlinear calibration method (up to 100 MHz). The nonlinear technique was based on a novel wave propagation model capable of predicting the true pressure-time waveforms at virtually any point in the field. The spatial averaging effects introduced by the finite aperture hydrophones were also accounted for. TGFA calibration results were obtained for different PVDF probes, including needle and membrane designs with nominal diameters from 50 to 500 micro m. The results were compared with discrete calibration data obtained from an independent national laboratory and the overall uncertainty was determined to be +/-1.5 dB in the frequency range 40-60 MHz and less than +/-1 dB below 40 MHz.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2003-06-05", "authors": ["E GRadulescu", "P ALewin", "JW\u00f3jcik", "ANowicki"], "doi": "10.1016/s0041-624x(03)00123-9"}

An optoelectronic phase-locked-loop-based PZT feedback controller with a proportional, integral, and differential (PID) circuit and a tunable voltage regulator is designed to achieve frequency synchronization, phase-noise suppression, and delay-time tuning. When the controlling voltage is tuned from -2.6 to 2.6 V, the maximum pulse-delay range, tuning slope, and tuning resolution of the laser pulse-train are 11.3 ns, 2.3 ps/mV, and 1.2 ps, respectively. Setting the gain constant of the PID circuit at 10 or larger causes the delay-time tuning function to be linearly proportional to the controlling voltage. In the delay-time tuning mode the uncorrelated single-side-band phase-noise density of the frequency-synchronized laser is approximately -120 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 5 kHz, which is only 7 dBc/Hz higher than that of the electrical frequency reference.

{"title": "Intertrigeminal region attenuates reflex apnea and stabilizes respiratory pattern in rats.", "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to determine whether the newly described anatomical pathway involving the pontine intertrigeminal region (ITR), (Chamberlin and Saper, 1998), has a physiological role in mediating or modulating vagally-induced reflex apnea. We explored the ITR impact on vagal reflex apnea elicited by intravenuously injected 5-HT in ten anesthetized rats. The animals had a catheter inserted into the femoral vein for administration of 5-HT (0.00375 mg) and respiration was recorded by piezo-electric crystal. Multibarrel pipettes were used to pressure inject glutamate (5-10 nl, 10 mM), kynurenic acid (10 nl, 50 mM, a glutamate receptor antagonist), and red dye into the ITR, unilaterally and bilaterally. Intravenous administration of 5-HT produced an immediate 3-s apnea. Microinjections of glutamate into the ITR produced apneas, while microinjections of kynurenic acid blocked the glutamate effect. Following glutamate antagonism, subsequent administration of 5-HT produced apneas of much longer duration (8 s). Acute ponto-medullary transection in two animals yielded even greater prolongation of 5-HT-induced apnea. We conclude that a physiological role for the ITR in respiration is to attenuate vagally-induced reflex apneas. This finding is in agreement with the general modulatory role of pontine structures in autonomic activities including respiration, heart rate and regulation of blood pressure. In addition, our data indicate that medullary circuits, independent of pontine structures, are sufficient to produce 5-HT induced reflex apnea.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2003-05-24", "authors": ["MiodragRadulovacki", "SasaPavlovic", "JasnaSaponjic", "David WCarley"], "doi": "10.1016/s0006-8993(03)02587-3"}

Therefore, it is crucial that the micromechanics of domains and their effect on internal stresses in ferroelectrics be understood.

The objective of the present study was to identify, characterize and localize other proteins expressed by the porcine oviduct during estrus that may function in an autocrine or paracrine manner to enhance fertilization and embryonic development. Oviducts were collected during the estrous cycle or early pregnancy, flushed and divided into functional segments, and portions of the infundibulum, ampulla and isthmus were fixed for immunocytochemical analysis or cultured. Culture media was semi-purified by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane after two-dimensional (2D)-SDS-PAGE and three different proteins were identified, excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis.

Electrophoresis and fluorography of media from Days 0 to 12 of early pregnancy or the estrous cycle revealed both spatial and temporal expression of C3b and IgA heavy chain but not PIIICP by the oviduct. Further, all three proteins were identified in oviduct fluid by electrophoresis, immunoblot or immunoprecipitation analysis. Complement component C3b and IgA heavy chain were immunolocalized in all three oviduct segments on all days; however, temporal and spatial differences were demonstrated. Staining was greater in the infundibulum and during estrus for all three identified proteins.

{"title": "Postural stability of the human mandible during locomotion.", "abstract": "Movements of the head and of the mandible relative to the head were measured in human subjects walking and running on a treadmill at various speeds and inclinations. A miniature magnet and piezo-electric accelerometer assembly was mounted on the mandibular incisors, and a Hall-effect sensor along with a second accelerometer mounted on a maxillary incisor along a common vertical axis. Signals from these sensors provided continuous records of vertical head and mandible acceleration, and relative jaw position. Landing on the heel or on the toe in different forms of locomotion was followed by rapid deceleration of the downward movement of the head and slightly less rapid deceleration of the downward movement of the mandible, i.e., the mandible moved downwards relative to the maxilla, then upwards again to near its normal posture within 200 ms. No tooth contact occurred in any forms of gait at any inclination. The movement of the mandible relative to the maxilla depended on the nature and velocity of the locomotion and their effects on head deceleration. The least deceleration and hence mandibular displacement occurred during toe-landing, for example, during \"uphill\" running. The maximum displacement of the mandible relative to the head was less than 1mm, even at the fastest running speed. The mechanisms that limit the vertical movements of the jaw within such a narrow range are not known, but are likely to include passive soft-tissue visco-elasticity and stretch reflexes in the jaw-closing muscles.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2003-05-14", "authors": ["Stanley CFlavel", "Michael ANordstrom", "Timothy SMiles"], "doi": "10.1016/s0021-9290(03)00009-5"}

With this approach, the detection of the shear force is accomplished by mechanically attaching a set of two piezoelectric plates to the scanning probe. One of the plates is used to excite the SECM tip causing it to resonate, and the other acts as a piezoelectric detector of the amplitude of the tip oscillation. Increasing shear forces in close proximity to the sample surface lead to a damping of the vibration amplitude and a phase shift, effects that are registered by connecting the detecting piezoelectric plate to a dual-phase analogue lock-in amplifier. The shear force and hence distance-dependent signal of the lock-in amplifier is used to establish an efficient, computer-controlled closed feedback loop enabling SECM imaging in a constant-distance mode of operation. The details of the SECM setup with an integrated piezoelectric shear-force distance control are described, and approach curves are shown. The performance of the constant-distance mode SECM with a non-optical detection of shear forces is illustrated by imaging simultaneously the topography and conductivity of an array of Pt-band microelectrodes.", "journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2003-05-13", "authors": ["BernardoBallesteros Katemann", "AlbertSchulte", "WolfgangSchuhmann"], "doi": "10.1002/chem.200204267"}

In both the natural and synthetic materials, a conspicuous amount of toughening arose from a microscopic crack-bridging mechanism operated by elasto-plastic stretching of unbroken second-phase ligaments along the crack wake. This mechanism led to a rising R-curve behavior. An additional micromechanism, responsible for stress relaxation at the crack tip, was recognized in the natural bone material and was partly mimicked in the hydroxyapatite/silver composite. This crack-tip mechanism conspicuously enhanced the cortical bone material resistance to fracture initiation. A piezo-spectroscopic technique, based on a microprobe measurement of 980 cm(-1) Raman line of hydroxyapatite, enabled us to quantitatively assess in situ the microscopic stress fields developed during fracture both at the crack tip and along the crack wake. Using the Raman piezo-spectroscopy technique, toughening mechanisms were assessed quantitatively and rationally related to the macroscopic fracture characteristics of hydroxyapatite-based materials.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

During whole-cell recordings ethanol (EtOH) inhibited AMPA receptor-mediated currents in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 10 to 500 mM. The steady-state component of AMPA-activated current was more sensitive to EtOH than the peak component. To examine the effect of EtOH on a well resolved peak current component, patches were excised from cultured cortical neurons, to which AMPA and EtOH were applied using a piezoelectric solution application system. Under this condition, the peak current was not inhibited significantly by EtOH. To further study possible mechanisms of EtOH inhibition, kainate and AMPA were used to evoke currents in the absence and presence of cyclothiazide. Ethanol inhibition was stronger when receptors were activated by low than high kainate concentrations. Cyclothiazide reduced inhibition by EtOH regardless of the agonist used to activate the receptor. Finally, EtOH inhibition was reduced in a point mutated (L497Y) GluRAi receptor that lacks desensitization. These findings suggest that EtOH inhibits AMPA receptors by stabilizing the desensitized state. Our results can explain some of the variation observed in EtOH inhibition in previous studies, and support the idea that physiologically relevant concentrations of EtOH can have a strong effect on AMPA receptor function.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2003-05-08", "authors": ["TommiM\u00f6ykkynen", "Esa RKorpi", "David MLovinger"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.103.050666"}

The experimental results show the increasing of the resonances frequencies with the level of applied pre-stress.

But limited joint mobility (LJM) and soft tissue abnormalities may also contribute. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships among thickness of plantar fascia, mobility of the metatarso-phalangeal joint, and forces expressed under the metatarsal heads.\nWe evaluated 61 diabetic patients: 27 without neuropathy (D group), 19 with neuropathy (DN group), and 15 with previous neuropathic foot ulceration (DNPU group). We also examined 21 control subjects (C). Ultrasound evaluation was performed with a high resolution 8- to 10-MHz linear array (Toshiba Tosbee SSA 240).

{"title": "The \"Haptic Finger\"- a new device for monitoring skin condition.", "abstract": "Touching the skin is of great importance for the Clinician for assessing roughness, softness, firmness, etc. This type of clinical assessment is very subjective and therefore non-reproducible from one Clinician to another one or even from time to time for the same Clinician. In order to objectively monitor skin texture, we developed a new sensor, placed directly on the Clinician's finger, which generate some electric signal when slid over the skin surface.\nThe base of this Haptic Finger sensor is a thin stainless steel plate on which sponge rubber, PVDF foil, acetate film and gauze are layered. The signal generated by the sensor was filtered and digitally stored before processing. In a first in vitro experiment, the sensor was moved over different skin models (sponge rubber covered by silicon rubber) of varying hardness and roughness. These experiments allowed the definition of two parameters characterizing textures. The first parameter is variance of the signal processed using wavelet analysis, representing an index of roughness. The second parameter is dispersion of the power spectrum density in the frequency domain, corresponding to hardness. To validate these parameters, the Haptic Finger was used to scan skin surfaces of 30 people, 14 of whom displayed a skin disorder: xerosis (n = 5), atopic dermatitis (n = 7), and psoriasis (n = 2).\nThe results obtained by means of the sensor were compared with subjective, clinical evaluations by a Clinician who scored both roughness and hardness of the skin. Good agreement was observed between clinical assessment of the skin and the two parameters generated using the Haptic Finger.

{"title": "Development of an immunosensor based on pressure transduction.", "abstract": "Traditional strategies for signal transduction in immunosensors are based on piezoelectric, thermometric, electrochemical, magnetic and optical methods. The use of pressure as a signal transduction method in immunosensors has not been reported previously. An immunosensor incorporating the detection of a change in pressure as the signal-transducing mechanism was investigated. A commercially available ultra-low pressure sensor was used in conjunction with a sealed chamber to assess the feasibility of this strategy. A key feature of the current approach is the use of a thin membrane (or film) in which to perform an immunoassay and subsequently to detect production of gas. The thinness contributes to efficient gas evolution and minimizes the effect of liquid acting as a \"sink\" for gas molecules. This feature also simplifies measurement of evolved gas, which traditionally was based on the use of bulk solutions, shaking and pH changes to \"release\" dissolved gas (especially carbon dioxide). Gas generation in the current approach is achieved by the coupling of catalase to haptens or antibodies for use in competitive or sandwich immunoassays, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the substrate. Performance characteristics of the sensor apparatus were assessed in several ways. Injection of various volumes of air from a gas-tight syringe produced an essentially linear relationship from 0.2 to 2.0 microl of injected volume, with a slope of approximately 5 V/microl.

{"title": "Screening of nucleation conditions using levitated drops for protein crystallization.", "abstract": "The growth of suitable protein crystals is an essential step in the structure determination of a protein by X-ray crystallography. At present, crystals are mostly grown using trial-and-error procedures, and protocols that rapidly screen for the crystal nucleation step are rare. Presented here is an approach to minimize the consumption of precious protein material while searching for the nucleation conditions. Acoustically levitated drops of known protein concentration (0.25-1.5-microL volumes) are injected with crystallizing agents using piezoelectric flow-through dispensers (ejecting 50-100-pL droplets at 1-9000 droplets/s). A restricted number of crystallizing agents representing three classes are used: poly(ethylene glycol), salts, and the viscous alcohol 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol. From a digitized picture of the levitated drop volume, calculations are performed giving the concentrations of all components in the drop at any time during a \"precipitation experiment\". Supersaturation is the prerequisite for crystal nucleation, and protein precipitation indicates high supersaturation. A light source illuminates the levitated drop, and protein precipitation is monitored using right-angle light scattering. On the basis of these intensity measurements and the volume determination, precipitation diagrams for each crystallizing agent are constructed that give the protein/crystallizing agent concentration boundaries between the minimum and the maximum detectable protein precipitation. Guided by the concentration values obtained from such plots, when approaching the supersaturation region, separate crystallization drops are mixed and allowed to equilibrate under paraffin oil. At conditions in which microcrystals can be observed, the nucleation tendency of the macromolecule is confirmed. Optimization of crystallization conditions can then follow. Proteins tested include alcohol dehydrogenase and D-serine dehydratase. Alcohol dehydrogenase, known to crystallize easily, was used to evaluate whether the ultrasonic field inhibits nucleation. Details are given for the screening procedure of D-serine dehydratase, an enzyme earlier found to be difficult to crystallize reproducibly.

The method is based on the use of functions that individually exactly satisfy the axisymmetric equations of motion and the Gauss electrostatic conditions. The axial and radial components of displacement and the potential are expressed as weighted sums of these functions. The functions form complete sets in the radial direction and arbitrary boundary conditions can, therefore, be satisfied on the flat surfaces. On the curved surface, certain uniform boundary conditions can be exactly satisfied. The weights are easily determined by using the orthogonal property of the functions. The input electrical admittance is a function of only the average boundary conditions and is very easily determined. Several special cases and numerical results are presented for electrically and mechanically excited cylinders to illustrate the method.

{"title": "Bubble observation and transient pressure signals in mechanical heart valve cavitation study.", "abstract": "Cavitation in the mechanical heart valve (MHV) was first detected in Edwards-Duromedics (ED) clinical explants. Early studies indicated that the pitted surface of the valve leaflet was due to cavitation phenomena occurring during valve closing. Cavitation is seen as the transient appearance of bubbles on the MHV surface on valve closure. The cavitation bubbles occur due to abrupt pressure changes in the vicinity of the valve on valve closing. Hence, analysis of the recorded field pressure can provide useful information relating to cavitation potential. In the present study, MHV cavitation potential was evaluated by counting bubble appearance probability and measuring bubble-size using an image-processing method. A simple and reliable technique using wavelet packet analysis (WPA) to evaluate cavitation potential was also investigated.\nA single-valve, pneumatic-driven burst tester system with adjustable pressure control unit, was used to simulate the closing process in the heart mitral valve at three driving pressures: 200, 500 and 1,000 mmHg, using three valve models. A triggering and imaging system was developed within the burst tester system to capture images of cavitation bubbles at predetermined time delays on valve closing. Transient pressure signals were recorded on both sides of the MHV occluder, using a high-frequency piezoelectric pressure transducer and a physiological pressure transducer. The pictures recorded were analyzed using image processing software to determine bubble appearance probability and bubble size. WPA was applied to the transient closing pressure signals to evaluate cavitation potential.\nCavitation intensity index (Cii) and bubble size-based cavitation index (BS-Ci) were measured by analyzing images captured at different time delays on valve closing at different driving pressures. WPA was used to analyze transient pressure signals at the inflow side of the MHV occluder at valve closure to calculate the WPA-based cavitation index (WPA-Ci). The three methods showed a similar trend for cavitation potential in the valves tested.\nIn the present study, two new approaches to evaluate MHV cavitation were investigated, namely WPA and BS-Ci. The results obtained produced a similar trend to that seen with an earlier method based on counting the probability that cavitation bubbles occur. As cavitation is primarily a function of the transient pressure within the vicinity of the closing valve occluder, the WPA method can be an effective method for future investigation of cavitation potential of mechanical heart valves.", "journal": "The Journal of heart valve disease", "date": "2003-04-19", "authors": ["XuLijun", "Yeo JoonHock", "Ned H CHwang"], "doi": null}

Since cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a cupro-protein expressed throughout the circadian mediated pathways of the body, it is proposed that PrP's Cu component performs a role in the conduction and distribution of endogenous electromagnetic energy; energy that has been transduced from incoming ultraviolet, acoustic, geomagnetic radiations. TSE pathogenesis is initiated once Mn substitutes at the vacant Cu domain on PrPc and forms a nonpathogenic, protease resistant, 'sleeping' prion. A second stage of pathogenesis comes into play once a low frequency wave of infrasonic shock metamorphoses the piezoelectric atomic structure of the Mn 3+ component of the prion, thereby 'priming' the sleeping prion into its fully fledged, pathogenic TSE isoform - where the paramagnetic status of the Mn 3+ atom is transformed into a stable ferrimagnetic lattice work, due to the strong electron-phonon coupling resulting from the dynamic 'Jahn-Teller' type distortions of the oxygen octahedra specific to the trivalent Mn species. The so called 'infectivity' of the prion is a misnomer and should be correctly defined as the contagious field inducing capacity of the ferrimagnetic Mn 3+ component of the prion; which remains pathogenic at all temperatures below the 'curie point'. A progressive domino-like 'metal to ligand to metal' ferrimagnetic corruption of the conduits of electromagnetic superexchange is initiated. The TSE diseased brain can be likened to a solar charged battery on continuous charge; where the Mn contaminated/Cu depleted circadian-auditory pathways absorb and pile up, rather than conduct the vital life force energies of incoming ultra violet, acoustic and geomagnetic radiation. Instead of harnessing these energies for the body's own bio-rhythmic requirements, an infrasonic shock induced metamorphosis of the Mn atom intervenes; initiating an explosive pathogenesis that perverts the healthy pathways of darkness and light; Cu prions are replaced by hyperpolarized Mn 3+ prions that seed self perpetuating 'cluster bombs' of free radical mediated neurodegeneration.

Efficiency issues related to periodic mechanical work of the actuators and the relationship among the driving electronics efficiency, the piezoelectric coupling factor, and the actuator energy transmission coefficient are discussed. The proposed charge recovery method exploiting the energy transfer between an inductor and a general capacitive load is compared with existing techniques that lead to inherent inefficiencies. A charge recovery method is then applied to piezoelectric actuators, especially to bimorph ones. Unitary efficiency can be obtained theoretically for purely capacitive loads while intrinsic losses such as hysteresis necessarily lower the efficiency. In order to show the validity of the method, a prototype driving electronics consisting of an extended H-bridge is constructed and tested by experiments and simulations.

This assay combines the advantages of the specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), sensitivity of enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and high-throughput of microspot. In this system, capture antibodies dissolved in methanol were spotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were then incubated with tissue lysates or cell lysates.

The irregular enclosure is modeled with four rigid walls and two simply supported flexible panels, and PZT actuators are bound to one of the flexible panels. The process of the new modeling method is as follows. First, the modal coupling method is used to establish the motion equations, which contain important coefficients such as modal masses and modal coupling coefficients, etc., of acoustic-structural-piezoelectric coupling system. Then, the acoustic modes and the modal masses of irregular enclosure are calculated by numerical methods. Last, the modal coupling coefficients in motion equations are calculated according to the numerical results of the acoustic modes of irregular enclosure and the modes of two panels. The validity of this modeling method is verified by a regular hexahedron enclosure. Two cost functions are applied to this model. With the two cost functions, good results are obtained in minimizing the sound-pressure level (SPL) within irregular enclosure according to numerical investigations. By comparing the results obtained under controlled and uncontrolled states, the control mechanisms of the system are discussed. It is found that the control mechanisms vary with disturbance frequencies. At most disturbance frequencies, the SPL within enclosure is reduced by restructuring the modes of two panels simultaneously. When the disturbance frequency comes close to one of the natural frequencies of panel a, the dominant mode of panel a is suppressed, while the modes of panel b are reconstructed. While the disturbance frequency is near one of the natural frequencies of panel b, the modes of two panels are restructured at the same time.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2003-03-27", "authors": ["Hou CGeng", "Zhu SRao", "Zu SHan"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1543585"}
{"title": "Dynamics of ferroelastic domains in ferroelectric thin films.", "abstract": "Dynamics of domain interfaces in a broad range of functional thin-film materials is an area of great current interest. In ferroelectric thin films, a significantly enhanced piezoelectric response should be observed if non-180 degrees domain walls were to switch under electric field excitation. However, in continuous thin films they are clamped by the substrate, and therefore their contribution to the piezoelectric response is limited. In this paper we show that when the ferroelectric layer is patterned into discrete islands using a focused ion beam, the clamping effect is significantly reduced, thereby facilitating the movement of ferroelastic walls. Piezo-response scanning force microscopy images of such islands in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films clearly point out that the 90 degrees domain walls can move. Capacitors 1 microm2 show a doubling of the remanent polarization at voltages higher than approximately 15 V, associated with 90 degrees domain switching, coupled with a d33 piezoelectric coefficient of approximately 250 pm V-1 at remanence, which is approximately three times the predicted value of 87 pm V-1 for a single domain single crystal.", "journal": "Nature materials", "date": "2003-03-26", "authors": ["VNagarajan", "ARoytburd", "AStanishevsky", "SPrasertchoung", "TZhao", "LChen", "JMelngailis", "OAuciello", "RRamesh"], "doi": "10.1038/nmat800"}
{"title": "Quantitative analysis of the effects of ultrasound from an odor sprayer on moth flight behavior.", "abstract": "A piezoelectric sprayer was recently developed for precision release of odor stimuli in olfactory research. The device replaces conventional dispensers used to release semiochemicals in studies of moth flight toward sources. However, the device generates high-frequency sounds in the range that some moths can hear. Ultrasound from the standard set-up sprayer had a considerable impact on flight behavior of the silver Y moth, Autographa gamma, tested in a flight tunnel. It was affected at all behavioral stages when the dispenser was driven at 120 kHz. Only 5% of the moths reached the source when exposed to 120-kHz sound from the dispenser compared to 65% in the control group without sound. The proportion taking flight was also reduced. Hearing threshold curves obtained electrophysiologically revealed that moths were sensitive to the frequency range at which the sprayer was operated and that sound intensity from the sprayer was up to 40 dB above the moths' electrophysiological hearing threshold. The audiogram for A. gamma was similar to audiograms obtained for other noctuids. Hearing sensitivity was highest at around 15 kHz, where the threshold was 35 dB SPL (sound pressure level). The threshold increased with frequency up to 94 dB SPL at 160 kHz. We improved the sprayer to operate at 300 kHz, which is beyond the hearing ability of most insects with ears. At this high frequency, the moths' sensitivity to ulrasound is reduced considerably, and we did not observe any effect on flight behavior compared to a control group without sound. Accordingly, this new piezoelectric sprayer can be used with ultrasound-sensitive insects and insensitive insects alike.", "journal": "Journal of chemical ecology", "date": "2003-03-22", "authors": ["NielsSkals", "DainiusPlepys", "Ashraf MEl-Sayed", "ChristerL\u00f6fstedt", "AnnemarieSurlykke"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1021924529533"}

In particular, the relation between the atrial dysfunction and electrical remodeling has not yet been studied.\nSeven goats were chronically instrumented with electrodes sutured to the atria and with ultrasonic piezoelectric crystals to record the atrial diameters. A pressure transducer was implanted in the right atrium. After 5 minutes, 3 hours, and throughout the first 5 days of artificially maintained AF, atrial contractile function was measured and the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was monitored for comparison. Also, the positive inotropic effects of the L-type Ca2+-channel agonist BayY5959 and short trains of rapid atrial pacing were studied. After resumption of sinus rhythm, the recovery of atrial contractile function was followed. After 5 minutes of AF, atrial contractility was decreased by approximately 55% but recovered completely within 10 minutes. Five days of AF nearly completely abolished the atrial contractile function, and recovery took 2 days. During the first days of AF, the development of the contractile dysfunction followed the same time course as the shortening of AERP (electrical remodeling). In remodeled atria, BayY5959 increased atrial contractility to the same extent as it prolonged AERP. The inotropic effect of short trains of rapid atrial pacing was similar in normal and remodeled atria.\nDepending on the duration of AF, different mechanisms contribute to the AF-induced atrial hypocontractility.

Because such distortion varies from image to image, this method can be used when the actual locations of some features within an image are known absolutely, or in a series of images in which the actual locations of some features are known not to vary. While the general case of polynomial mapping of degree N requires the determination of 2(N+ 1)2 matrix elements by regression, we find that by understanding the mechanism by which piezoelectric creep distorts scanning probe microscope images, we can fix most of these coefficients at 0 or 1 a priori, leaving only 2(N+ 1) coefficients to be determined by regression. We describe our implementation of this strategy using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) programming language, and demonstrate our technique on a series of atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of diblock copolymer microdomains.

{"title": "Method for printing functional protein microarrays.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric dispensing of proteins from borosilicate glass capillaries is a popular method of protein biochip fabrication that offers the advantages of sample recovery and noncontact with the printing substrate. However, little regard has been given to the quantitative aspects of dispensing minute volumes (1 nL or less) at the low protein concentrations (20 micrograms/mL or less) typically used in microprinting. Specifically, loss of protein sample due to nonspecific adsorption to the glass surface of the dispensing capillaries can limit the amount of protein delivered to the substrate. We demonstrate the benefits of a low ionic strength buffer containing the carrier protein BSA that effectively minimizes the ionic strength-dependent phenomenon of nonspecific protein adsorption to borosilicate glass. Over the concentration range of 20-2.5 micrograms/mL, the dispensing of a reference IgG in 10 mM PBS including 0.1% BSA resulted in the deposition of 3.6- to 44-fold more IgG compared to the deposition of IgG in standard 150 mM PBS in the absence of BSA. Furthermore, when the IgG was dispensed with carrier protein, the resulting spots exhibited a more uniform morphology. In a direct immunoassay for cholera toxin, capture antibody spots dispensed in 10 mM PBS containing 0.1% BSA produced fluorescent signals that were 2.8- to 4.3-fold more intense than antibody spots that were dispensed in 150 mM PBS without BSA.

To acquire data sets in a reasonable time, the 2-D sections were derived from data collected with a transducer that was scanning continuously in a direction perpendicular to the beam axis. Due to spectral broadening effects induced by scanning tissue, significant tradeoffs must be made between frame rate, lateral resolution and the minimum detectable blood velocity. 3-D flow images were reconstructed with flow data acquired from a series of adjacent planes. The system was evaluated at a center frequency of 50 MHz, using two PVDF transducers with lateral resolutions of 43 microm and 65 microm and axial resolutions of 66 microm to 72 microm, respectively. Velocity ranges were from below 1 mm/s to 25 mm/s. In vivo validation experiments using the mouse ear demonstrated the ability to follow branching patterns of closely spaced microvessels from 30 microm to 100 microm in diameter. Experiments conducted on mouse tumors successfully imaged microvessel morphology in the tumor microcirculation.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2003-02-27", "authors": ["David EGoertz", "Joanne LYu", "Robert SKerbel", "Peter NBurns", "F StuartFoster"], "doi": "10.1016/s0301-5629(02)00682-8"}
{"title": "Development of a vibratory microinjection method.", "abstract": "To reduce cellular damage by pronuclear microinjection and nuclear transfer, we have recently developed a vibratory microinjection method. A micropipette was fixed to a piezoelectric ceramic with a resonance frequency of 70 kHz. When this micropipette was vibrated, it easily entered a mouse-fertilized egg without any sharp depression of the cell body, whereas a sharp, deep depression at the insertion site was observed when the micropipette was not vibrated. A depression rate defined as a rate of a depth of depression over an original cell diameter was utilized as an index of cellular deformation. The depression rates with and without vibration were 11.1 +/- 5.2% (N = 24) and 40.4 +/- 8.8% (N = 16), respectively (P < 0.0001, Student's t-test).

Piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance techniques were used to investigate the immobilization of ADH on Au colloids. The cyclic voltammogram tends to be more irreversible with increased ADH concentration. In the impedance spectroscopic study, an obvious difference of the electron transfer resistance between the Au-colloid modified electrode and the bare gold electrode was observed. Using the piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor, the Michaelis constant, K(m), and the maximum initial rate, V(max), of the immobilized ADH were estimated as 6.03 x 10(-4) M and 0.63 Hzs (-1), respectively.

The accumulation of the insoluble product on Au electrodes or Au/quartz crystals alters the interfacial electron-transfer resistance at the Au electrode or the mass associated with the piezoelectric crystal, thus enabling the quantitative transduction of the DNA sensing by Faradaic impedance spectroscopy or microgravimetric quartz crystal microbalance measurements, respectively. One sensing configuration involves the association of a complex consisting of the target DNA and a biotinylated oligonucleotide to the functionalized transducers. The binding of the avidin/alkaline phosphatase conjugate to the sensing interface followed by the biocatalyzed precipitation provides the amplification path for the analysis of the target DNA. This analysis scheme was used to sense the target DNA with a sensitivity limit that corresponds to 5 x 10(-14) M. The second amplified detection scheme involves the use of a nucleic-acid-functionalized alkaline phosphatase as a biocatalytic conjugate for the precipitation of the insoluble product. Following this scheme, the functionalized transducers are interacted with the analyzed sample that was pretreated with the oligonucleotide-modified alkaline phosphatase, followed by the biocatalyzed precipitation as the amplification route for the analysis of the target DNA.

{"title": "MRI-guided gas bubble enhanced ultrasound heating in in vivo rabbit thigh.", "abstract": "In this study, we propose a focused ultrasound surgery protocol that induces and then uses gas bubbles at the focus to enhance the ultrasound absorption and ultimately create larger lesions in vivo. MRI and ultrasound visualization and monitoring methods for this heating method are also investigated. Larger lesions created with a carefully monitored single ultrasound exposure could greatly improve the speed of tumour coagulation with focused ultrasound. All experiments were performed under MRI (clinical, 1.5 T) guidance with one of two eight-sector, spherically curved piezoelectric transducers. The transducer, either a 1.1 or 1.7 MHz array, was driven by a multi-channel RF driving system. The transducer was mounted in an MRI-compatible manual positioning system and the rabbit was situated on top of the system. An ultrasound detector ring was fixed with the therapy transducer to monitor gas bubble activity during treatment. Focused ultrasound surgery exposures were delivered to the thighs of seven New Zealand while rabbits. The experimental, gas-bubble-enhanced heating exposures consisted of a high amplitude 300 acoustic watt, half second pulse followed by a 7 W, 14 W or 21 W continuous wave exposure for 19.5 s. The respective control sonications were 20 s exposures of 14 W, 21 W and 28 W. During the exposures, MR thermometry was obtained from the temperature dependency of the proton resonance frequency shift. MRT2-enhanced imaging was used to evaluate the resulting lesions. Specific metrics were used to evaluate the differences between the gas-bubble-enhanced exposures and their respective control sonications: temperatures with respect to time and space, lesion size and shape, and their agreement with thermal dose predictions. The bubble-enhanced exposures showed a faster temperature rise within the first 4 s and higher overall temperatures than the sonications without bubble formation. The spatial temperature maps and the thermal dose maps derived from the MRI thermometry closely correlated with the resulting lesion as examined by T2-weighted imaging. The lesions created with the gas-bubble-enhanced heating exposures were 2-3 times larger by volume, consistently more spherical in shape and closer to the transducer than the control exposures. The study demonstrates that gas bubbles can reliably be used to create significantly larger lesions in vivo.

Mechanically vibrating AT-cut quartz plates may be used to determine the product of the fluid density and viscosity of a fluid in which it is immersed, through measurement of the impedance minimum of the electrical equivalent circuit or of the corresponding frequency. The density-viscosity product changes abruptly between fluid phases and rapidly along the isotherm corresponding to the critical temperature, enabling such a plate to act as a sensor of these fluid features. We consider the limitations and linearity of such a sensor and its behavior when a liquid-gas meniscus crosses its surface. We demonstrate for the first time the effective use of an AT-cut quartz sensor in mapping the phase behavior of fluids, using measurements made on carbon dioxide and ethane for calibration and then investigating an ethane-carbon dioxide mixture. The advantages of this experimental approach are that (i) piezoelectric sensors are available for operation up to 1,000 degrees C and at extremely high pressures and (ii) the measurement of the density-viscosity product of supercritical fluids is inherently simpler than traditional techniques for determining phase behavior.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2003-02-15", "authors": ["Robert MOag", "Peter JKing", "Christopher JMellor", "Michael WGeorge", "JieKe", "MartynPoliakoff"], "doi": "10.1021/ac020322g"}
{"title": "On the alpha --> beta transition of carbon-coated highly oriented PVDF ultrathin film induced by melt recrystallization.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is one of the polymers which exhibit pronounced polymorphic crystalline forms, depending on crystallization conditions. Four different crystalline modifications, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, have been reported so far. Among them, even though the alpha-form is the most common one, the beta-phase is the one that has attracted the widest interest due to its extensive piezo- and pyroelectric applications. During the past few decades, a substantial amount of work has been done in attempts to characterize these crystal modifications and transformations among them. It was well documented that the alpha-form PVDF can be easily obtained through melt crystallization of the PVDF at atmospheric pressure. Its beta-counterpart can, however, only be directly obtained by growth from solution, molecular epitaxy on the surface of potassium bromide, melt crystallization at high pressures, or by applying with a strong electric field. Transformation from its alpha-phase to beta-phase has been achieved by mechanical deformation, while the retransformation could be conducted through melt recrystallization at atmospheric pressure. In the present work, the recrystallization behavior of carbon-coated melt-drawn oriented PVDF ultrathin films at atmospheric pressure was studied by means of transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The results indicate that through vacuum evaporating a thin carbon layer on the surface of highly oriented alpha-PVDF ultrathin film, not only has its high orientation been preserved after a complete melting and recrystallization process, but an alpha --> beta transition of PVDF has also been achieved through melt recrystallization at atmospheric pressure.

Urea-soluble proteins from rat lens membrane fractions were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and probed with monoclonal antibodies to vimentin or cytokeratins, or a polyclonal antibody to phakinin. The monoclonal antibody to vimentin recognized the expected protein (M(r) = 56 kD, pI = 5.1) and several smaller and more acidic peptides including a 44-kD spot with a pI of 4.9.

{"title": "Traveling wave ultrasonic motor: coupling effects in free stator.", "abstract": "Generally a stator of traveling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUM) consists of piezoelectric transducers (annular plate or rods) coupled by the way of a metallic ring. These transducers divided into halves are excited independently by two electrical signals with different phases of about 90 degrees. So an elastic traveling wave propagates along the circumference of the ring and a rotor pressed on this vibrating surface is then driven by the stator via contact forces. Many difficulties appear in developing TWUM because the contact between the stator and the rotor via a frictional material is very important. However that may be, the first stage consists in obtaining a vibrating stator with optimum characteristics with two symmetrical phases. The aim of this paper is to discuss some coupling effects in a free stator through an enhanced equivalent circuit model. A simple experimental method based on impedance measurements is performed to estimate the coupling characteristics at a low driving voltage. This paper reports results obtained with the free stator of the well known piezoelectric ultrasonic motor \"USR60\" by Shinsei Co. Ltd. Since the stator behaves as an elastic body, interactions between the two electrical inputs might be described by the introduction of a coupling oscillator. The comparison of experimental and theoretical results leads to validate the new equivalent circuit of the free stator. The presence of coupling impedance could imply a change of electrical supply condition to optimize the TWUM efficiency.

{"title": "Effect of outer hair cell piezoelectricity on high-frequency receptor potentials.", "abstract": "The low-pass voltage response of outer hair cells predicted by conventional equivalent circuit analysis would preclude the active force production at high frequencies. We have found that the band pass characteristics can be improved by introducing the piezoelectric properties of the cell wall. In contrast to the conventional analysis, the receptor potential does not tend to zero and at any frequency is greater than a limiting value. In addition, the phase shift between the transduction current and receptor potential tends to zero. The piezoelectric properties cause an additional, strain-dependent, displacement current in the cell wall. The wall strain is estimated on the basis of a model of the cell deformation in the organ of Corti. The limiting value of the receptor potential depends on the ratio of a parameter determined by the piezoelectric coefficients and the strain to the membrane capacitance. In short cells, we have found that for the low-frequency value of about 2-3 mV and the strain level of 0.1% the receptor potential can reach 0.4 mV throughout the whole frequency range.

Filters of cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, mixed cellulose ester, nylon, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyester, and polyvinylidene fluoride were tested for their affinity toward mono- (K), di-(Mn, Cu, Zn), and trivalent (lanthanum [La]) metals. Metal concentrations were quantified using radioisotopes and speciation was calculated. Results showed that metals had the lowest affinity for polycarbonate and nylon filters and the highest affinity for cellulose- and polyester-type filters. Furthermore, it was shown that the metal load on cellulose filters correlated best with free ion concentrations (indicating electrostatic attraction), while loads on other filters correlated better with total metal concentrations. Filtering a 5-ml solution of pH 5 did not affect its metal concentrations, ranging from 10 nM (La) to 49 microM (K).

{"title": "Competitive quenching fluorescence immunoassay for chlorophenols based on laser-induced fluorescence detection in microdroplets.", "abstract": "An improved biomonitoring system for the analysis of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) in urine samples has been developed. The principle of the biosensor device is the detection of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in single microdroplets by a homogeneous quenching fluorescence immunoassay (QFIA). The competitive immunoassay occurs in microdroplets (d = 58,4 microm) produced by a piezoelectric generator system with 10-microm-diameter orifice. A continuous Ar ion laser (488 nm) excites the fluorescent tracer; its fluorescence is detected by a spectrometer attached to a 512 x 512 cooled, charge-coupled device camera. Fluorescence is quenched by specific binding of TCP polyclonal antibodies to the fluorescent tracer (hapten A-fluorescein); the quenching effect is diminished by the presence of the analyte. Thus, an increase in the signal is produced in a positive dose-dependent manner when TCP is present in the sample. In 10 mM PBS buffer, the IC50 of the LIF-microdroplet QFIA is 0.45 microg L(-1) reaching a LOD of 0.04 microg L(-1). The QFIA with the same reagents performed in microtiter plate format achieved a LOD of 0.36 microg L(-1) in buffer solution. Performance in human urine was similar to that observed in the buffer.

Rotofor protein fractions were further separated by SDS/PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. pADPr-binding proteins were analysed by autoradiography of the protein blot after incubation with (32)P-labelled automodified pADPr polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Peptide mass fingerprinting of selected bands identified the most abundant pADPr-binding proteins as hnRNPs, a family of proteins that bind pre-mRNA into functional complexes involved in mRNA maturation and transport to the cytoplasm. Sequence homology database searching against a previously reported pADPr-binding sequence motif revealed that the hnRNPs contain a putative pADPr-binding sequence pattern [Pleschke, Kleczkowska, Strohm and Althaus (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40974-40980]. pADPr-binding assays performed with synthetic peptides by the dot-blot technique and with nitrocellulose-transferred recombinant hnRNPs confirmed the pADPr-binding protein identification and the specificity of the interaction. These results could establish a link between increased levels of pADPr in DNA damaged cells and the modified protein expression pattern resulting from altered mRNA trafficking.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2003-01-09", "authors": ["Jean-PhilippeGagn\u00e9", "Joanna MHunter", "Beno\u00eetLabrecque", "Beno\u00eetChabot", "Guy GPoirier"], "doi": "10.1042/BJ20021675"}
{"title": "Nebulization of biodegradable nanoparticles: impact of nebulizer technology and nanoparticle characteristics on aerosol features.", "abstract": "Nanoparticles may be effective drug delivery systems for use in various pulmonary therapeutic schemes. This study investigated the effect of nebulization technology and nanoparticle characteristics on the features of aerosol generation. Suspensions of biodegradable nanoparticles consisting of commercially available poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and novel comb polymers were nebulized with a jet, ultrasonic, and piezo-electric crystal nebulizer. The effects of the nanoparticle suspensions on the aerosol droplet size, as well as the nanoparticle size before and after nebulization, were characterized via laser diffraction. While the individual nanoparticle suspensions showed no clinically relevant influence on aerosol droplet size, as compared to control experiments, an enhanced nanoparticle aggregation within the droplets was observed. This aggregation was further characterized by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Dependency of aggregation on nebulizer technology and nanoparticle characteristics was noted. Nanoparticles exhibiting the highest surface hydrophobicity were particularly susceptible to aggregation when nebulized with a jet nebulizer. Aggregation was reduced with nanoparticles exhibiting a more hydrophilic surface or when using ultrasonic nebulizers. We conclude that the biodegradable nanoparticles contained in the suspensions did not affect the aerosol droplet size in a clinically relevant manner; however, both the nanoparticle characteristics and the technique of aerosol generation influence nanoparticle aggregation occurring during aerosolization.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2002-12-20", "authors": ["Lea AnnDailey", "ThomasSchmehl", "TobiasGessler", "MatthiasWittmar", "FriedrichGrimminger", "WernerSeeger", "ThomasKissel"], "doi": "10.1016/s0168-3659(02)00370-x"}

{"title": "Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) affinity biosensor for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) detection.", "abstract": "A DNA piezoelectric sensor has been developed for the detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were immobilised on the sensor surface of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device and the hybridisation between the immobilised probe and the target complementary sequence in solution was monitored. The probe sequences were internal to the sequence of the 35S promoter (P) and Nos terminator (T), which are inserted sequences in the genome of GMOs regulating the transgene expression. Two different probe immobilisation procedures were applied: (a) a thiol-dextran procedure and (b) a thiol-derivatised probe and blocking thiol procedure. The system has been optimised using synthetic oligonucleotides, which were then applied to samples of plasmidic and genomic DNA isolated from the pBI121 plasmid, certified reference materials (CRM), and real samples amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The analytical parameters of the sensor have been investigated (sensitivity, reproducibility, lifetime etc.). The results obtained showed that both immobilisation procedures enabled sensitive and specific detection of GMOs, providing a useful tool for screening analysis in food samples.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2002-12-18", "authors": ["IlariaMannelli", "MariaMinunni", "SaraTombelli", "MarcoMascini"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(02)00166-5"}
{"title": "MIP-based solid phase extraction cartridges combined with MIP-based sensors for the detection of microcystin-LR.", "abstract": "Microsystin-LR is one of the most widespread and dangerous toxins produced by the freshwater Cyanobacteria. The contamination of water supplies with microcystin-LR has been reported in several areas around the world and the development of an easy-to-use, rapid, robust and inexpensive sensor for this toxin is urgently required. In this work an artificial receptor for microcystin-LR was synthesised using the technique of molecular imprinting. The composition of the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was optimised using computer modelling. The synthesised polymer was used both as a material for solid-phase extraction (SPE) and as a sensing element in a piezoelectric sensor. Using the combination of SPE followed by detection with a piezoelectric sensor the minimum detectable amount of toxin was 0.35 nM. The use of MIP-SPE provided up to 1000 fold pre-concentration, which was more than sufficient for achieving the required detection limit for microcystin-LR in drinking water (1 nM). This work is the first example where the same MIP receptor has been used successfully for both SPE and the corresponding sensor.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2002-12-18", "authors": ["IChianella", "S APiletsky", "I ETothill", "BChen", "A P FTurner"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(02)00165-3"}
{"title": "Analysis of spurious bulk waves in ball surface wave device.", "abstract": "We analyzed the acoustic waves propagating in a sphere to establish a useful guideline for the design of NDE apparatus and ball surface acoustic wave (SAW) device exploiting the diffraction-free propagation of SAW on a sphere. First, we calculated the laser-generated acoustic displacements both under ablation condition and under thermoelastic condition and verified experimentally the validity of the calculation. Next, the acoustic waves excited by out-of-plane stress and those excited by in-plane stress were compared. The results showed that when the out-of-plane stress was applied, the relative amplitudes of the bulk waves to that of the SAW were larger and the number of bulk waves was larger than that when the in-plane stress was applied, while the SAW had similar waveforms in each case. The ratio of the relative amplitude of the bulk waves for the out-of-plane stress and the in-plane stress was 3.1:1 at phi(1)=90 degrees and 1.67:1 at phi(1)=0 degrees. The large amplitude for the out-of-plane stress can be explained by wide directivities of bulk waves. Consequently, we found that it is necessary for ball SAW device to select a piezoelectric material and form of interdigital transducer so that the in-plane stress becomes dominant.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2002-12-05", "authors": ["SatoruIshikawa", "HideoCho", "YusukeTsukahara", "NoritakaNakaso", "KazushiYamanaka"], "doi": "10.1016/s0041-624x(02)00395-5"}
{"title": "Impedance characterization of a piezoelectric immunosensor part II: Salmonella typhimurium detection using magnetic enhancement.", "abstract": "This study investigated the usefulness and characteristics of a 5-MHz quartz crystal resonator as a sensor of biological pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium. An impedance analyzer measured the impedance behavior of the oscillating quartz crystal exposed to various concentrations of Salmonella (10(2)-10(8) cells per ml). The Salmonella cells were captured by antibody-coated paramagnetic microspheres, and then these complexes were moved magnetically to the sensing quartz and were captured by antibodies immobilized on the crystal surface. The response of the crystal was expressed in terms of equivalent circuit parameters. The motional inductance and the motional resistance increased as a function of the concentration of Salmonella. The viscous damping was the main contributor to the resistance and the inductance in a liquid environment. The load resistance was the most effective and sensitive circuit parameter. A magnetic force was a useful method to collect the complexes of Salmonella-microspheres on the crystal surface and enhance the response of the sensor. In this system, the detection limit, based on resistance monitoring, was about 10(3) cells per ml.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2002-11-26", "authors": ["Gi HoKim", "A GarthRand", "Stephen VLetcher"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(02)00143-4"}

An impedance analyzer measured the impedance of the quartz crystal, which determined all mechanical properties of the oscillating quartz and its immediate environment. In this study, the impedance behavior of the oscillating crystal was characterized in air, in potassium phosphate buffer solution, and with immobilization of antibodies using protein-A. The potassium phosphate buffer behaved like a Newtonian liquid. The series resonance frequency shifted down about 900 Hz on contact with the buffer. An immobilized-antibody layer on the quartz surface behaved like a rigid mass when immersed in the buffer solution. The impedance curve following immobilization of antibodies was shifted down in frequency by about 200 Hz compared with its value when the bare crystal was immersed in the buffer solution.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2002-11-26", "authors": ["Gi HoKim", "A GarthRand", "Stephen VLetcher"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(02)00142-2"}
