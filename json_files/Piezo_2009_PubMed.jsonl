{"title": "Development of a piezoelectric sensor for the detection of methamphetamine.", "abstract": "A computationally designed molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) specific for methamphetamine was used as a synthetic receptor for the development of a piezoelectric sensor. Several different protocols were tested for the immobilisation of the MIP onto the gold sensor surface. The developed MIP sensor had a detection limit for methamphetamine as low as 1 microg mL(-1). The effect of the addition of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVA) on the pre-polymerisation mixtures, which increases the porosity of the polymer layer, was also studied using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). PVA seemed to affect both the porosity and the binding kinetics of the polymers prepared in dimethylformamide (DMF). However, no clear effect on porosity and binding kinetics was observed when polymers were prepared in diglyme. Moreover, PVA did not appear to improve the amplitude of the sensor response. In conclusion, because of its excellent recognition ability in aqueous solutions, the sensor described in this work could be an ideal starting point for the development of a commercial device for fast, on-site or road-side testing of drugs of abuse in body fluids such as saliva.", "journal": "The Analyst", "date": "2010-05-08", "authors": ["MariaRomero Guerra", "IvaChianella", "Elena VPiletska", "KalKarim", "Anthony P FTurner", "Sergey APiletsky"], "doi": "10.1039/b819351g"}

Its phase diagram shows a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) starting from a tricritical triple point of a cubic paraelectric phase (C), ferroelectric rhombohedral (R), and tetragonal (T) phases. The high piezoelectricity of the MPB compositions stems from the composition proximity of the MPB to the tricritical triple point, which leads to a nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy and thus facilitates polarization rotation between 001T and 111R states. We predict that the single-crystal form of the MPB composition of the present system may reach a giant d(33) = 1500-2000 pC/N.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylates glue for polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride (PP-PVDF) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) fixation in a rabbit model.\nIn 40 New Zealand white rabbits, three pieces (3\u00d73cm) of a PP-PVDF mesh (n=120) were fixed in IPOM technique on both sides of a midline laparotomy. For mesh fixation we used spiral tacks, nonabsorbable sutures, or cyanoacrylate glue in a randomized manner. All animals were killed after 12 wk. The prosthetic materials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for evaluation of the tensile strength and histologic analysis. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation.\nMeshes fixed with glue showed a significantly higher tenacity of adhesions (2.75\u00b10.97) compared with those with tacks (2.44\u00b10.97 sutures versus 1.91\u00b10.92 tacks).

{"title": "RUNspike, a complementary virus filter spiking method: a solution to the problem of reduced throughput due to the addition of the virus spike.", "abstract": "The traditional approach to virus filter spiking studies (virus added to the feed solution before the start of filtration) can lead to oversized viral filtration systems because of the non-representative volumetric throughputs (L/m2) that can be seen with the addition of the virus spike. The reduction in throughput is thought to be caused by interactions that take place between the species in the virus stock solution alone, or in conjunction with the species in the drug product. The traditional approach assumes that virus filter log reduction value (LRV) is directly related to volumetric throughput and limits manufacturing scale designs to the volumetric throughput achieved in the spiking study. This article references previous work that shows that % flow decay is a more relevant critical parameter than volumetric throughput for a poly(vinylidene diflouride) (PVDF) parvovirus filter. Based on this work, one could design the manufacturing-scale viral filtration system to the representative volumetric throughput achieved without the virus spike and implement a flow decay limit in manufacturing to ensure virus LRV. RUNspike is a complementary method that can be easily implemented today and that goes one step further. The RUNspike method challenges the same total virus as the traditional method, but the virus is added at the end of the filtration, after the representative volumetric throughput has been demonstrated. Comparable RUNspike and traditional LRV data, at the same flow decay, bridges the gap and strengthens the case for the flow decay-based design approach.", "journal": "PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology", "date": "2010-02-23", "authors": ["JoeParrella", "YalingWu", "David WKahn", "PaulGenest"], "doi": null}

The major components of the catheter are the high power cylindrical piezoelectric element and parabolic balloon reflector.

High intensity ultrasound heating in the focal zone results in a lesion surrounding the pulmonary veins that creates an electrical conduction blocks and relief from AF symptoms.

{"title": "Tracking Control of Hysteretic Piezoelectric Actuator using Adaptive Rate-Dependent Controller.", "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of actuators involving smart materials like piezoelectric, control of such materials becomes important. The existence of the inherent hysteretic behavior hinders the tracking accuracy of the actuators. To make matters worse, the hysteretic behavior changes with rate. One of the suggested ways is to have a feedforward controller to linearize the relationship between the input and output. Thus, the hysteretic behavior of the actuator must first be modeled by sensing the relationship between the input voltage and output displacement. Unfortunately, the hysteretic behavior is dependent on individual actuator and also environmental conditions like temperature. It is troublesome and costly to model the hysteresis regularly. In addition, the hysteretic behavior of the actuators also changes with age. Most literature model the actuator using a cascade of rate-independent hysteresis operators and a dynamical system. However, the inertial dynamics of the structure is not the only contributing factor. A complete model will be complex. Thus, based on the studies done on the phenomenological hysteretic behavior with rate, this paper proposes an adaptive rate-dependent feedforward controller with Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operators for piezoelectric actuators. This adaptive controller is achieved by adapting the coefficients to manipulate the weights of the play operators. Actual experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive controller. The main contribution of this paper is its ability to perform tracking control of non-periodic motion and is illustrated with the tracking control ability of a couple of different non-periodic waveforms which were created by passing random numbers through a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20Hz.", "journal": "Sensors and actuators.

Thin wave-guiding layers of variable thickness are coated on the piezoelectric substrate of the devices. Two different layer materials were used: sputtered SiO(2) and a new polymer in this field, paryleneC (poly-[2-chloro-p-xylylene]). Insertion loss, resonance frequency, frequency changes during protein precipitation and noise of the devices are discussed as a function of the thickness of the wave-guiding layer. It is demonstrated that the application of an optimized wave-guiding layer increases the sensitivity. When using SiO(2) as wave-guiding layer, an optimum layer thickness of 4 microm leads to a detection limit of 1.7 pg/mm(2). Therefore, the detection limit is improved by factor 7.7 as compared to uncoated SAW devices. Parylene-coated devices reach a detection limit of 2.9 pg/mm(2) at an optimum layer thickness of 0.5 microm. This corresponds to an improvement by factor 4.3. As the SAW devices used in this study are commercially available at low costs, applying appropriate wave-guiding layers permits an application as chemical or biochemical sensors with excellent sensitivities.

{"title": "Dipolar electrostatic energy effect on relaxation process of monolayers at air-water interface: analysis of thermodynamics and kinetics.", "abstract": "In order to understand the effect of electrostatic energy on phase transition from monolayer to multilayer, isobaric relaxation process of Langmuir monolayers composed of stearic acid or ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene copolymer with various vinylidene fluoride (VDF) ratios is investigated in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. A monotonous decreasing tendency of material loss with respect to temperature is observed for stearic acid monolayer, which is due to thermal activation effect on phase transition from monolayer to multilayer. In contrast, for the ferroelectric monolayer it presents a nonmonotonous behavior of losing materials with a peak position near the Curie temperature, which is not only owing to thermal activation but also dipole moment change. This observation is confirmed for the copolymer monolayers with other VDF content ratios. Amazingly, for the ferroelectric monolayers a good correspondence is found for critical temperatures evaluated from several independent methods including the analysis on slow collapse. This finding again tells the fact that the relaxation process, namely phase transition from monolayer to multilayer, is greatly influenced by dipolar electrostatic energy. Moreover, the study of time dependent relaxation process reveals a diffusionlike behavior of multilayer structure formation, which cannot be interpreted by classical models. Hence a new model based on diffusion-driven material transfer is proposed and diffusivity of the copolymer molecules is estimated with a value of 0.4x10(-5) cm(2)/s.

The emission energy of both QDs and optical modes red- or blue- shift depending on the strain sign, with the QD emission shifting more rapidly than the optical mode with applied strain. The QD energy shifts are used to estimate the strain in the structures based on linear deformation potential theory and the finite element method. The shift of the modes is attributed to both the physical deformation and the change in refractive index due to the photoelastic effect. Remarkably, excitonic emissions from different QDs are observed to shift at different rates, implying that this technique can be used to bring spatially separated excitons into resonance.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2010-01-07", "authors": ["TimZander", "AndreasHerklotz", "SuwitKiravittaya", "MohamedBenyoucef", "FeiDing", "PaolaAtkinson", "SantoshKumar", "Johannes DPlumhof", "KathrinD\u00f6rr", "ArmandoRastelli", "Oliver GSchmidt"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.17.022452"}
{"title": "In search of the identity of the XAP-1 antigen: a protein localized to cone outer segments.", "abstract": "To determine the identity of the XAP-1 antigen. The XAP-1 antibody has been used by many investigators and is recognized as an index of photoreceptor outer segment maturity, yet its antigen remains unknown.\nPrevious studies documented that the XAP-1 antigen is a photoreceptor membrane-associated protein. To enrich for this protein, the authors prepared outer segment preparations from mouse retinas. Crude membrane and cytoplasmic fractions from this preparation were then generated using ultracentrifugation. Proteins were solubilized using n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside and separated using SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the crude membrane fraction were run on multiple lanes of a single gel, one lane of which was transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with the XAP-1 antibody. The remaining lanes were silver-stained. Very careful alignment of the Western blot with the silver-stained lanes indicated the presence of a single lightly stained band at the same position as the immunopositive band. nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed on the pooled protein bands. On determining the protein identity, confirmatory Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry studies were performed.\nWestern blot analysis performed using the XAP-1 antibody indicated a single immunoreactive band at approximately 74 kDa in lysates from both total outer segment and crude membrane preparations. No immunoreactive band was present in the cytoplasmic lysate. MS analysis of pooled silver stained bands determined that the XAP-1 antigen is Grp78. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry both support this identification.\nPresent evidence indicates that the XAP-1 antigen is Grp78, a protein that has been previously documented in the interphotoreceptor matrix surrounding cones.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["SubaNookala", "RohitGandrakota", "AmiraWohabrebbi", "XiaoFeiWang", "DanielleHowell", "FrancescoGiorgianni", "SarkaBeranova-Giorgianni", "Dominic MDesiderio", "Monica MJablonski"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.09-4286"}

Various ratios of piezoelectric/electrostrictive (P/E) volume percent were used to form PE-MBLC. It was found that d(33)(eff) and K(eff) in PE-MBLC follow the series 2-2 composite mixing rule. However, the measured results were slightly lower than those of the calculated values because of a large difference in dielectric displacement between piezoelectric and electrostrictive layers and because the electrostrictor acts as the resistor that impedes the domain switching in piezoelectric layer during poling. In addition, we have investigated the field-induced displacement in PE-MBLC and BIPEDU actuators. In comparison, the displacement of BIPEDU actuators was much higher than that of PE-MBLC actuators. This was attributed to the good quality of bonding between ceramic and metal, which contributed to the proper stress/force transfer, as well as the metal sheet, which acted as a flextentional structure for PE-MBLC to generate more axial displacement in BIPEDU actuators. The load dependence of displacement in BIPEDU was obtained.

{"title": "Experimental and numerical investigations of vibration characteristics for parallel-type and series-type triple-layered piezoceramic bimorphs.", "abstract": "The dynamic characteristics of parallel-type and series-type piezoelectric bimorphs are analyzed in this study. The transverse (out-of-plane) and planar (in-plane) vibrations for piezoceramic bimorphs in normal and abnormal connections are investigated experimentally by 2 noncontact optical techniques and impedance analyzer. Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is the major experimental technique for measuring the resonant frequency and corresponding vibration mode shape. Out-of-plane and in-plane vibrations of piezoelectric bimorphs at resonance are obtained by a self-arranged ESPI optical setup. The laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a point-wise measurement technique for out-of-plane displacement and is used to determine the out-of-plane resonant frequencies. The impedance analyzer is used to measure the resonant frequencies for in-plane motions. It is noted from the experimental results that the out-of-plane modes are the dominant motion for the normal connection and only symmetric vibration mode shapes can be excited. The in-plane motions are large enough to be measured using the ESPI method for normal connections. The in-plane resonant modes are observed for parallel-type piezoelectric bimorph in parallel connections; however, the in-plane mode shapes are similar to the out-of-plane mode shapes for the series-type piezoelectric bimorph in series connection. Hence, the particle motions of the piezoelectric bimorph at resonance are essentially 3-D for the normal connection. It is interesting to note that both symmetric and asymmetric out-of-plane vibration mode shapes can be excited with large applied voltage but no in-plane motion is observed for the abnormal connection. In addition to experimental methods, numerical computations based on the finite element method are used to verify the experimental results. Good agreements of the resonant frequencies and mode shapes are obtained for experimental and numerical results.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-12-31", "authors": ["Yu-HsiHuang", "Chien-ChingMa"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1351"}

Here we present a new and unique method to perform single-cell and cell-cell communication studies in Type 2 diabetes-related research. The airborne analytical system offers \"contactless\" sample handling in the sub-microlitre volume range and is here equipped with fluorescence imaging detection. The system utilizes acoustically levitated droplets as \"wall-less\" test tubes and in-house constructed piezoelectric flow-through picolitre droplet dispensers for precise reagent supply. Hormone-mediated regulation of adipocyte lipolysis and communication between adipocytes and beta-cells can be studied at the few-cell level. Thus, lipolysis could be detected in single adipocytes, whether it was induced by isoprenaline or inhibited by insulin. Furthermore, the airborne system allowed the comparison of lipolysis in adipocytes of different sizes: a large adipocyte responded more slowly than a small cell. Furthermore, stimulation of insulin secretion by high glucose or acetylcholine administration to a levitated drop containing insulin-producing beta-cells resulted in inhibition of isoprenaline-induced lipolysis in adipocytes present in the same drop. The results show the applicability of the airborne analytical system for single cell analysis and for cell-cell communication studies as well as the potential for future analysis directly from human cells obtained from clinical biopsies.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2009-12-22", "authors": ["SabinaSantesson", "EvaDegerman", "PatrikRorsman", "ThomasJohansson", "SandraLemos", "StaffanNilsson"], "doi": "10.1039/b907834g"}

The equipment consists of 2 hand pieces, 2 inserts, and 2 peristaltic pumps; the microvibrations that are created in the piezoelectric hand piece cause the inserts to vibrate linearly between 60 and 210 mum.\nIn all the patients, Piezosurgery provided excellent control without bleeding and harming effects on the adjacent structures. No patients experienced adverse effects.\nPiezosurgery is a new and revolutionary osteotomy technique using the microvibrations of scalpels at ultrasonic frequency, so that soft tissue will not be damaged even upon accidental contact with the cutting tip.

A quartz crystal microbalance was used to monitor and optimize the assembly process and to test the immunological activity of the deposited antibody molecules. Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize the surface roughness of the multilayers before and after the deposition of the immunoglobulins. The obtained results confirmed the successful deposition of the proposed immunosensor and demonstrated its high potential for the measurement of analytes of clinical interest.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Mechanical vibration compensation method for 3D+t multi-particle tracking in microscopic volumes.", "abstract": "The acquisition and analysis of data in microscopic systems with spatiotemporal evolution is a very relevant topic. In this work, we describe a method to optimize an experimental setup for acquiring and processing spatiotemporal (3D+t) data in microscopic systems. The method is applied to a three-dimensional multi-tracking and analysis system of free-swimming sperm trajectories previously developed. The experimental set uses a piezoelectric device making oscillate a large focal-distance objective mounted on an inverted microscope (over its optical axis) to acquire stacks of images at a high frame rate over a depth on the order of 250 microns. A problem arise when the piezoelectric device oscillates, in such a way that a vibration is transmitted to the whole microscope, inducing undesirable 3D vibrations to the whole set. For this reason, as a first step, the biological preparation was isolated from the body of the microscope to avoid modifying the free swimming pattern of the microorganism due to the transmission of these vibrations. Nevertheless, as the image capturing device is mechanically attached to the \"vibrating\" microscope, the resulting acquired data are contaminated with an undesirable 3D movement that biases the original trajectory of these high speed moving cells. The proposed optimization method determines the functional form of these 3D oscillations to neutralize them from the original acquired data set. Given the spatial scale of the system, the added correction increases significantly the data accuracy. The optimized system may be very useful in a wide variety of 3D+t applications using moving optical devices.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Evaluation of biaxial mechanical properties of soft tubes and arteries using sonometry.", "abstract": "Arterial elasticity has become a topic of importance in the past decades, as it has shown that it can be used to predict cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Several in vivo and ex vivo techniques have been developed to characterize the mechanical properties of vessels. In vivo techniques tend to ignore the anisotropicity of the vessel wall components. While ex vivo techniques tend to be destructive and do not to account for the geometry of the arteries. In this paper we present a technique using sonometry to study the elasticity of soft tubes and excised pig carotids in different directions. The method uses piezoelectric crystals to track the strain in the circumferential and longitudinal directions while the tubes or vessels are being pressurized. We compare the Young's moduli obtained from sonometry experiments performed in two different types of tubes with the mechanical testing done in the material used to make these tubes. We also present data obtained in the excised pig carotids and show the differences in the longitudinal versus the circumferential directions.

During the study, the MLSS in membrane tank was in the range of 6,840 approximately 9,540 mg/L. Filtration operation mode of the membrane unit was 9 minutes on production and 1 minute backwash. The air scouring for the membranes was 0.18-0.30 Nm(3)/h per m(2) membrane area all of the time. Trials on different membrane fluxes were conducted to obtain the sustainable flux. The analytical results showed that COD, TOC, T-N and NH4-N of the treated water were <30 mg/L, 5-7 mg/L, <13 mg/L and <0.1 mg/L, respectively, which met the requirement of Industrial Water for reuse.

Recent studies have indicated that chronic alcohol consumption leads to the lysine-hyperacetylation of several hepatic proteins, and this list is growing quickly.\nTo identify other hyperacetylated proteins in ethanol-fed livers, we chose a proteomics approach. Cytosolic and membrane proteins (excluding nuclei) were separated on 2D gels, transferred to PVDF and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for acetylated lysine residues. Hyperacetylated proteins were selected for trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric analysis.\nIn all, 40 proteins were identified, 11 of which are known acetylated proteins. Remarkably, the vast majority of hyperacetylated membrane proteins were mitochondrial residents. Hyperacetylated cytosolic proteins ranged in function from metabolism to cytoskeletal support. Notably, 3 key anti-oxidant proteins were identified whose activities are impaired in ethanol-treated cells. We confirmed that the anti-oxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, actin and cortactin are hyperacetylated in ethanol-treated livers.\nAlcohol-induced hyperacetylation of multiple proteins may contribute to the development of liver injury.

{"title": "A short pulse (7 micros FWHM) and high repetition rate (dc-5 kHz) cantilever piezovalve for pulsed atomic and molecular beams.", "abstract": "In this paper we report on the design and operation of a novel piezovalve for the production of short pulsed atomic or molecular beams. The high speed valve operates on the principle of a cantilever piezo. The only moving part, besides the cantilever piezo itself, is a very small O-ring that forms the vacuum seal. The valve can operate continuous (dc) and in pulsed mode with the same drive electronics. Pulsed operation has been tested at repetition frequencies up to 5 kHz. The static deflection of the cantilever, as mounted in the valve body, was measured as a function of driving field strength with a confocal microscope. The deflection and high speed dynamical response of the cantilever can be easily changed and optimized for a particular nozzle diameter or repetition rate by a simple adjustment of the free cantilever length. Pulsed molecular beams with a full width at half maximum pulse width as low as 7 micros have been measured at a position 10 cm downstream of the nozzle exit. This represents a gas pulse with a length of only 10 mm making it well matched to for instance experiments using laser beams. Such a short pulse with 6 bar backing pressure behind a 150 microm nozzle releases about 10(16) particles/pulse and the beam brightness was estimated to be 4x10(22) particles/(s str). The short pulses of the cantilever piezovalve result in a much reduced gas load in the vacuum system. We demonstrate operation of the pulsed valve with skimmer in a single vacuum chamber pumped by a 520 l/s turbomolecular pump maintaining a pressure of 5x10(-6) Torr, which is an excellent vacuum to have the strong and cold skimmed molecular beam interact with laser beams only 10 cm downstream of the nozzle to do velocity map slice imaging with a microchannel-plate imaging detector in a single chamber. The piezovalve produces cold and narrow (Delta v/v=2%-3%) velocity distributions of molecules seeded in helium or neon at modest backing pressures of only 6 bar. The low gas load of the cantilever valve makes it possible to design very compact single chamber molecular beam machines with high quality cold and intense supersonic beams. The high speed cantilever piezovalve may find broad applicability in experiments where short and strong gas pulses are needed with only modest pumping, the effective use of (expensive) samples, or the production of cold atomic and molecular beams.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2009-12-02", "authors": ["DanielIrimia", "DimitarDobrikov", "RobKortekaas", "HanVoet", "Daan Avan den Ende", "Wilhelm AGroen", "Maurice H MJanssen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3263912"}

A nominal system model is identified experimentally from the responses excited by random signals measured by an FBG displacement sensor that are simultaneously compared with those obtained from a laser Doppler vibrometer. To further investigate the sensing ability of the proposed system in a feedback control problem, control strategies including robust H(infinity) control, proportional-integralderivative control, and pseudoderivative feedback control are implemented.

The use of a cantilever probe for sample manipulation within the vertical plane often makes absolute positioning of the probe, subject to thermal drift, difficult. In addition, the vertical test is unable to observe changes in the sample structure responsible for mechanical behavior detected by the probe. In the present study, an alternative mechanical tester was developed that incorporated a pair of micro-needles to manipulate a sample in a project plane, allowing acquisition of the accurate probe position and entire sample image. Using a vision-based feedback control, a micro-needle driven by a piezo actuator is moved to give user-defined displacements or forces to sample. To show its usefulness and versatility, three types of viscoelastic measurements on actin stress fibers isolated from smooth muscle cells were demonstrated: strain rate-controlled tensile tests, relaxation tests and creep tests. Fluorescence imaging of the stress fibers using Qdots over the course of the measurements, obtained through multiple image detectors, was also carried out.

Limited removal efficiencies of currently applied techniques such as advanced oxidation processes require more performant strategies. The aim of this study was to establish an innovative degradation process for diatrizoate, a highly recalcitrant ICM, by using biogenic Pd nanoparticles as free suspension or immobilized in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polysulfone (PSf) membranes. As measured by HPLC-UV, the removal of 20mg L(-1) diatrizoate by a 10mg L(-1) Pd suspension was completed after 4h at a pH of 10. LC-MS analysis provided evidence for the sequential hydrodeiodination of diatrizoate. Pd did not lose its activity after incorporation in the PVDF and PSf matrix and the highest activity (k(cat)=30.0+/-0.4h(-1) L g(-1) Pd) was obtained with a casting solution of 10% PSf and 500mg L(-1) Pd. Subsequently, water containing 20mg L(-1) diatrizoate was treated in a membrane contactor, in which the water was supplied at one side of the membrane while hydrogen was provided at the other side. In a fed batch configuration, a removal efficiency of 77% after a time period of 48h was obtained.

{"title": "Hysteresis compensation of piezoelectric actuators: the modified Rayleigh model.", "abstract": "In this study, we develop a novel modified Rayleigh model for hysteresis compensation in piezoelectric actuators. Piezoelectric actuators suffer from hysteresis, in large drive fields of more than 100 V, which can result in serious displacement errors. The typical phenomenological approach is to use the Rayleigh model; however, this model gives more than 10% difference with experiments at the large electric fields of more than 1kV/mm. Furthermore, there are no studies that apply the Rayleigh model to the compensation of precision actuators, such as stack actuators; it has only been applied in the study of the physical properties of piezoelectric materials. Therefore, we propose a modified Rayleigh model, in which each coefficient is defined differently according to whether the field is increasing or decreasing to account for asymmetry at the high fields. By applying a computer-based control from an inverse form of this modified Rayleigh model, we show that we can compensate for hysteresis to reduce the position error to less than five percent. This model has the merits of reducing complicated fitting procedures and of saving computation time compared to the Preisach model. Specifically, this model cannot only predict the hysteresis curves in all local fields using only one fitting procedure, but also make it possible to control the displacement of various piezo-based actuators without expensive sensors, based on the charge-based model.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JongkyuPark", "WonkyuMoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2009.10.012"}

Their intrinsic hysteretic behavior makes control difficult. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator can model hysteresis well, albeit a major inadequacy: the inverse operator does not exist when the hysteretic curve gradient is not positive definite, i.e., ill condition occurs when slope is negative. An inevitable tradeoff between modeling accuracy and inversion stability exists. The hysteretic modeling improves with increasing number of play operators. But as the piecewise continuous interval of each operator reduces, the model tends to be ill-conditioned, especially at the turning points. Similar ill-conditioned situation arises when these actuators move heavy loads or operate at high frequency. This paper proposes an extended PI operator to map hysteresis to a domain where inversion is well behaved. The inverse weights are then evaluated to determine the inverse hysteresis model for the feedforward controller. For illustration purpose, a piezoelectric actuator is used.", "journal": "IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division", "date": "2009-11-26", "authors": ["U-XuanTan", "Win TunLatt", "Cheng YapShee", "Cameron NRiviere", "Wei TechAng"], "doi": "10.1109/TMECH.2008.2009936"}
{"title": "Melamine acoustic chemosensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer film.", "abstract": "A melamine piezomicrogravimetric (acoustic) chemosensor using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film has been devised and tested. The MIP films were prepared by electropolymerization of the melamine complexed by the functional monomer of the bis(bithiophene) derivative bearing an 18-crown-6 substituent 4. The structure of the MIP-melamine complex was visualized by the DFT B3LYP/3-21G(*) energy optimization calculations. The sensitivity and selectivity of the MIP film was improved by cross-linking the polymer with the bithianaphthene monomer 5 and the presence of the porogenic ionic liquid in the prepolymerization solution. After electropolymerization, the melamine template was extracted from the MIP film with an aqueous strong base solution. The measurements of UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), DPV, and EIS as well as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging confirmed extraction of the melamine template from the MIP film and then rebinding of the melamine analyte while the film relative roughness and porosity was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, respectively. The analytical as well as kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the chemosensing were assessed under flow-injection analysis (FIA) conditions with piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) detection.

We aimed for a new approach to anchor a biologic heart valve in the mitral position by inserting a valve-carrying hollow body into the left atrium. This approach was investigated in both a simulation and an animal model.\nAfter creating a mold representing the porcine left atrium from the pulmonary veins as far as the mitral valve, a nitinol skeleton was sutured onto interlaced yarns of polyvinylidene fluoride fitting the mold. The resulting device was equipped with a commercially available stentless valve (25 mm) and investigated in a simulator regarding basic functionality. Furthermore, the device was implanted in 8 female pigs through incision of the left atrium during extracorporeal circulation. Before implantation, artificial regurgitation was created by means of excision from the posterior mitral leaflet. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and radiologic examinations followed. For a postmortem examination, the entire heart and the lungs were excised.\nWe could demonstrate the functionality of the heart valve in a complex, collapsible, and self-expanding hollow body. The device adapted to the surrounding structures, leading to an exclusion of the left atrium. Sufficient treatment of mitral regurgitation was monitored hemodynamically and by means of echocardiographic analysis, although overall visualization remained difficult. Therefore in 4 animals computed tomographic scans were performed.

Two methods of filling the cell are used: (a) a capillary method, which can be used only at high temperature because of the low value of the viscosity, and (b) the classical one, thereafter called compression method, which consists in placing the sample between the two slides of the cell and to bring them closer. By filling the cell at high temperature either with the compression or the capillary method, we show that the response of both compounds is liquidlike ( G' approximately f2 and G'' approximately f , where f is the frequency) for temperatures higher than a certain temperature T0 and gel-like (G' approximately const, G'' approximately f) below T0. This change in behavior from the conventional flow response to a gel-like response, when approaching the glass transition, is observed for nonsliding conditions and for very weak-imposed shear strains. It can be explained by a percolation-type mechanism of preglassy elastic clusters, which correspond to long-range and long-lived density fluctuations that are frozen at the time scale of the experiment. The sample response is therefore the sum of two contributions: one is due to the flow response of the polymer melt and the other to the elastic response of the network formed by the preglassy elastic clusters. By filling the cell below T0 with the compression method, both compounds exhibit a gel-type behavior by gently bringing closer the slides of the cell and an anomalous low-frequency behavior characterized by G'=const and G''=const by increasing the pressure used to bring closer the slides of the cell. A compression-assisted aggregation of the preglassy elastic clusters can explain both the increase in the low-frequency elastic plateau when the sample thickness is decreased and the anomalous low-frequency behavior. Further evidence for the existence of these elastic clusters is provided by the following results: (a) the nonlinear response of the samples as a function of the strain amplitude, which can be explained by the Payne effect, and (b) the aggregation effects, which can be mimicked by a polydimethylsiloxane melt filled with silica particles, the silica particles playing the role of the preglassy elastic clusters. All these observations show that PAOCH3 is not a macroscopically solidlike material with an unconventional type of elasticity, as claimed by Mendil [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 077801 (2006)]. The gel-type behavior observed here on two SCLCPs ( PAOCH3 and LCP105) and previously on some conventional flexible polymers (atactic polystyrene, poly-n-butylacrylate) seems to be a generic effect of the glass transition.

A new dual amplifier is introduced that exhibits a small-signal bandwidth of 2 MHz with a 100 nF capacitive load. The dual amplifier is comprised of a standard high-voltage amplifier combined with a fast low-voltage amplifier to improve performance at higher frequencies. Experiments demonstrate a 300 kHz sine wave of 20 Vp-p amplitude being applied to a 100 nF load with negligible phase delay and a peak-to-peak current of 3.8 A. With a voltage range of 200 V and peak current of 1.9 A a standard amplifier would require a worst-case power dissipation of 380 W.

The method is experimentally validated with an inkjet printhead that is augmented with a glass connection channel, through which the bubble was observed optically, while at the same time the piezocurrent was measured.

Historically, detection of bacteria and viruses requires two different capture methods to detect both types of organisms in a given water sample. The purpose of this present study was to evaluate a newly devised dual layered filtration system, which was developed to simultaneously concentrate both viruses and bacteria in one step from marine waters. An apparatus was designed to accommodate two 90-mm diam., 0.45 microm pore size membranes in series, one on top of the other. The top polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was used to filter bacteria by physical straining while the bottom HA membrane retained viruses through adsorption. Results indicated that the dual layer filtration system recovered 83+/-14% of the test bacteria (Enterococcus fecalis) and 81+/-28% of the test virus (MS2 coliphage) on the top and bottom membranes, respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of using a dual layered filtration system for the simultaneous concentration of both bacteria and viruses on separate filters from recreational beach waters. This system is relatively simple to use, inexpensive, and has the potential to be suitable for routine monitoring. This study serves as a proof of concept for the technique.

However, the scaffolds fabricated by RP have very smooth surfaces, which tend to discourage initial cell attachment.

{"title": "REM sleep estimation only using respiratory dynamics.", "abstract": "Polysomnography (PSG) is currently considered the gold standard for assessing sleep quality. However, the numerous sensors that must be attached to the subject can disturb sleep and limit monitoring to within hospitals and sleep clinics. If data could be obtained without such constraints, sleep monitoring would be more convenient and could be extended to ordinary homes. During rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, respiration rate and variability are known to be greater than in other sleep stages. Hence, we calculated the average rate and variability of respiration in an epoch (30 s) by applying appropriate smoothing algorithms. Increased and irregular respiratory patterns during REM sleep were extracted using adaptive and linear thresholds. When both parameters simultaneously showed higher values than the thresholds, the epochs were assumed to belong to REM sleep. Thermocouples and piezoelectric-type belts were used to acquire respiratory signals. Thirteen healthy adults and nine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients participated in this study. Kappa statistics showed a substantial agreement (kappa > 0.60) between the standard and respiration-based methods.

{"title": "Biomaterial mediated epithelial-mesenchymal interaction of salivary tissue under serum free condition.", "abstract": "Many organs develop from epithelial-mesenchymal interactions such that in order to regenerate these organs, it might be a preferable strategy to recapitulate this process. However, in the current culture system designed for tissue interaction, the supplement of serum is required. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility of reproducing epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and ensuing morphogenesis in a serum-free condition. In accordance with the previous studies, by using a standard model of murine fetal submandibular gland (SMG), the tissue interaction and the morphogenesis were largely dependent on serum. Nonetheless, when tissue recombinants were cultivated on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), but not on other biomaterials, the serum-deprived effect could be rescued. On PVDF, SMG tissue recombinant was able to increase epithelial size, de novo synthesize basement membrane, and develop new branches without serum. Although the gene expression levels of selected morphogens were not significantly altered, the precise localization of morphogenetic-decisive extracellular matrix such as type III collagen and the superior adsorbing capacity of essential diffusible factors like fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) might account for PVDF effect. Accordingly, the result demonstrates that it is possible to establish a serum-free system that is competent in facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal interaction of salivary tissue.

Nothing is known about the existence of putative C21 receptors on plasma membranes of target cells.\nWe analyzed the nature of C21-binding proteins in cell lysates of skin fibroblasts using C21 affinity columns.

{"title": "Electric field effects in RUS measurements.", "abstract": "Much of the power of the Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) technique is the ability to make mechanical resonance measurements while the environment of the sample is changed. Temperature and magnetic field are important examples. Due to the common use of piezoelectric transducers near the sample, applied electric fields introduce complications, but many materials have technologically interesting responses to applied static and RF electric fields. Non-contact optical, buffered, or shielded transducers permit the application of charge and externally applied electric fields while making RUS measurements. For conducting samples, in vacuum, charging produces a small negative pressure in the volume of the material--a state rarely explored. At very high charges we influence the electron density near the surface so the propagation of surface waves and their resonances may give us a handle on the relationship of electron density to bond strength and elasticity. Our preliminary results indicate a charge sign dependent effect, but we are studying a number of possible other effects induced by charging. In dielectric materials, external electric fields influence the strain response, particularly in ferroelectrics. Experiments to study this connection at phase transformations are planned. The fact that many geological samples contain single crystal quartz suggests a possible use of the piezoelectric response to drive vibrations using applied RF fields. In polycrystals, averaging of strains in randomly oriented crystals implies using the \"statistical residual\" strain as the drive.

{"title": "Acoustical properties of the swimbladder in the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau.", "abstract": "Both the swimbladder and sonic muscles of the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau (Linnaeus) increase in size with fish growth making it difficult to distinguish their relative contributions to sound production. We examined acoustics of the swimbladder independent of the sonic muscles by striking it with a piezoelectric impact hammer. Amplitude and timing characteristics of bladder sound and displacement were compared for strikes of different amplitudes. Most of the first cycle of sound occurred during swimbladder compression, indicating that the bladder rapidly contracted and expanded as force increased during the strike. Harder hits were shorter in duration and generated a 30 dB increase in amplitude for a 5-fold or 14 dB range in displacement. For an equivalent strike dominant frequency, damping, bladder displacement and sound amplitude did not change with fish size, i.e. equal input generated equal output. The frequency spectrum was broad, and dominant frequency was driven by the strike and not the natural frequency of the bladder. Bladder displacement decayed rapidly (zeta averaged 0.33, equivalent to an automobile shock absorber), and the bladder had a low Q (sharpness of tuning), averaging 1.8. Sound output of an acoustic source is determined by volume velocity (surface area x velocity), and bladder surface area, muscle dimensions and contraction amplitude increase with fish size. Therefore, larger fish will be capable of producing more intense sound. Because the bladder is a low Q resonator, its output will follow muscle contraction rates independent of its size and natural frequency.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2009-10-20", "authors": ["Michael LFine", "Charles BKing", "Timothy MCameron"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.033423"}

The substrates consisted of thin films of cellulose that were spin-coated onto polyvinylamine (PVAm) precoated quartz crystal sensors carrying conductive gold surfaces. In QCM the quartz crystals are piezoelectrically driven and the frequency and dissipation shifts allow monitoring of substrate hydrolysis at various temperatures and enzyme concentrations in situ and in real time. The changes in frequency of cellulose-coated quartz resonators during their incubation in cellulase solutions were related to contributions from the liquid phase properties, the adsorptions of cellulase enzymes, and the hydrolysis of the substrate. Cellulase adsorption was found to be nonspecific and irreversible on gold-, PVAm-, and cellulose-coated quartz crystal sensors. The contribution to frequency shifts due to the bulk fluid properties of the cellulase solutions (at concentrations lower than 0.5 mg/mL) was minimal compared to the frequency shifts produced by cellulase binding. The maximum frequency decreases were fitted to a Langmuir model. The adsorption constant and the maximum adsorption were estimated by the fitting parameters of this model. The hydrolysis process was modeled by using a dose-response model that was then used to estimate the maximum hydrolysis rate, to compare the relative effects of temperature on adsorption and hydrolysis rate, and to obtain the apparent activation energy of cellulose hydrolysis. The hydrolysis rate increased with incubation temperature while apparent adsorption decreased. The apparent activation energy for the hydrolysis of the cellulose films employed was calculated to be 37 kJ/mol.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Simple manufacturing techniques were developed which resulted in the production of large numbers of fully populated fiber composites that offered performance comparable with a conventional 1-3 piezocomposite. A modified process facilitated the production of efficient fiber piezocomposite elements separated by polymer channels which conformed to a highly flexible (13 mm radius of curvature), 2-D matrix array configuration. This arrangement has been termed a Composite Element Composite Array Transducer, or CECAT. These devices were evaluated in terms of their impedance spectra, pulse-echo response, and surface displacement characteristics. The random piezoceramic fiber arrangements showed comparable sensitivity and bandwidth to periodic devices while minimizing the parasitic interpillar modes associated with periodic structures. Investigations have indicated that CECAT arrays constructed with 250 microm diameter fibers can be operated at frequencies of up to 3 MHz and transducers incorporating 10 microm diameter fibers can extend the frequency range above 6 MHz.

IMCPA is composed of triple-row phased arrays: a 6-MHz array in the center row for imaging and two 4-MHz arrays in the outer rows for therapy. Different types of piezoelectric materials and stack configurations may be employed to maximize their respective functionalities, i.e., therapy and imaging. Fabrication complexity of IMCPA may be reduced by assembling already constructed arrays. In IMCPA, reflected therapeutic signals may corrupt the quality of imaging signals received by the center-row array. This problem can be overcome by implementing a coded excitation approach and/or a notch filter when B-mode images are formed during therapy. The 13-bit Barker code, which is a binary code with unique autocorrelation properties, is preferred for implementing coded excitation, although other codes may also be used. From both Field II simulation and experimental results, we verified whether these remedial approaches would make it feasible to simultaneously carry out imaging and therapy by IMCPA. The results showed that the 13-bit Barker code with 3 cycles per bit provided acceptable performances. The measured -6 dB and -20 dB range mainlobe widths were 0.52 mm and 0.91 mm, respectively, and a range sidelobe level was measured to be -48 dB regardless of whether a notch filter was used.

The PZT was doped with 2 mol% neodymium and 1.1 mol% manganese. For characterization, the fibers were embedded in a polymer. The resulting 1-3 composites were poled with constant electric field. Strain and polarization were measured by applying a bipolar sinusoidal voltage of high amplitude. Instead of the expected shifted butterfly-shaped strain hysteresis, an asymmetric strain-field relation was observed. It is characterized by a rather linear region in direction of the poling field and an inflated region without strain switching for reversed polarity.

{"title": "Piezoelectric surgical device in endoscopic sinus surgery: an initial clinical experience.", "abstract": "Revision endoscopic sinus surgery presents special challenges, such as the need to remove thick osteoneogenic bone close to the orbit or skull base. Currently available drills and microdebriders have shortcomings for this task, including risk to the underlying periorbita or dura. Recently, piezoelectric ultrasound technology has been used to remove bone while preserving adjacent soft tissue structures. This technology has been effective in several areas of the body, and it logically follows that it may have beneficial rhinologic applications. The purpose of this medical communication is to report an initial clinical experience with piezoelectric technology in revision sinus surgery. The piezoelectric surgical device was used during revision endoscopic sinus surgery in 14 patients in the author's practice from June 2006 to January 2009. All patients had an underlying bone component to their sinus condition, such as osteoneogenesis adjacent to the orbit or skull base. The piezoelectric surgical device performed successfully in removing osteoneogenic bone, and no complications were noted from its use. Piezoelectric surgical technology generates low-frequency ultrasound that dissects bone and appears to offer an option to mechanical drill instrumentation when used during endoscopic sinus surgery to address thick osteoneogenic bone. The clinical experience reported herein shows initial feasibility of the technology in selected cases of sinus surgery. On the basis of the favorable observations from this clinical experience, further exploration and discussion would appear to be valuable.", "journal": "The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology", "date": "2009-10-09", "authors": ["William EBolger"], "doi": "10.1177/000348940911800903"}

The GaN (0002) synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), electroluminescence (EL) and optical power-current (L-I) measurement reveal that AlInGaN quaternary alloys as barriers in MQWs can improve the crystal quality, optical emission performance, threshold current and slope efficiency of the laser diode structure to a large extent compared with other barriers. The relevant mechanisms are that: 1. The Al component increases the barrier height of the MQWs so that more current carriers will be caught in. 2. The In component counteracts the strain in the MQWs that decreases the dislocations and defects, thereby the nonradiative recombination centers are decreased. 3. The In component decreases the piezoelectric electric field that makes the electrons and the holes recombine more easily.", "journal": "Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu", "date": "2009-10-09", "authors": ["Wei-HuaChen", "HuiLiao", "Xiao-DongHu", "RuiLi", "Quan-JieJia", "Yuan-HaoJin", "Wei-MinDu", "Zhi-JianYang", "Guo-YiZhang"], "doi": null}

The observation of a finite sequence of single tone or of multiharmonic cycles, subsampled in an expanded time-scale interval, allows the characteristics of the real oscillations to be well-reconstructed in a frequency-compressed spectrum, where each component is translated toward lower frequencies. The introduced technique is applied to nanoliter-sized water drops, oscillating in a hydrocarbon matrix up to 150 Hz frequency, by using a standard PAL CCD camera provided with an electronic shutter. Application examples show the important role of this technique in data analysis and interpretation of typical high-frequency oscillating drop/bubble experiments. In particular, this technique is effective to check the onset of critical hydrodynamic effects and allows for the determination of the intrinsic elasticity of the liquid/cell system as a function of frequency by comparison of the liquid volume, as displaced by a piezo-actuator, and the actually observed drop volume-amplitude oscillation.

This paper summarizes and compares the results of an in-vitro study on three design approaches and the feasibility of using microelectromechanical system acoustic sensors as implantable microphones to convert the umbo vibration directly into a high-quality sound signal. The requirements of sensors were selected including the ability to withstand large body shocks or sudden changes of air pressure. Umbo vibration characteristics were extracted from literature and laboratory measurement data. A piezoelectric vibration source was built and calibrated to simulate the umbo vibration. Two laboratory models of the acoustic sensor were studied. The model-A device, using electrets-microphone as the sensor, was designed and tested in the laboratory and on temporal bones. The results verify that the laboratory measurement is consistent with the temporal bone characterization and achieves a near flat frequency response with a minimum detectable signal of a 65-dB sound-pressure-level (SPL) at 1 kHz. The model-B sensor was then designed to increase the sensitivity and provide an easy mounting on umbo. The model-B device can detect 40-dB SPL sound in the 1-2 kHz region, with 100-Hz channel bandwidth.

We assessed the level of phospho-Akt in different types of primary breast cancers and compared the use of autoradiograph X-ray film with a PVDF-DAB-staining system. Twelve percent of the tumours had no phospho-Akt protein, 25% had low phospho-Akt expression, 51% had intermediate expression and 12% had high phospho-Akt expression. No relationship was observed between phospho-Akt and tumour grade, tumour size or nodal status. A significant relationship was demonstrated between phospho-Akt score and oestrogen receptor status (P=0.014). Univariate analysis demonstrated that intermediate levels of phospho-Akt in breast tumour tissue are associated with a lower probability of developing recurrences (P=0.035), while in multivariate analyses, none of the phospho-Akt levels appeared to be independent predictors of disease recurrence or death.

For overcoming these limitations, many efforts have been directed at developing alternative methods to avoid the in-digestion. Here, we present a new method for efficient protein digestion and tryptic peptide recovery, which involved electroblotting gel-separated proteins onto a PVDF membrane, excising the PVDF bands containing protein of interest, and dissolving the bands with pure DMF (> or =99.8%). Before tryptic digestion, NH(4)HCO(3) buffer was added to moderately adjust the DMF concentration (to 40%) in order for trypsin to exert its activity. Experimental results using protein standards showed that, due to actions of DMF in dissolving PVDF membrane and the membrane-bound substances, the proteins were virtually in-solution digested in DMF-containing buffer. This protocol allowed more efficient digestion and peptide recovery, thereby increasing the sequence coverage and the confidence of protein identification. The comparative study using rat hippocampal membrane-enriched sample showed that the method was superior to the reported on-membrane tryptic digestion for further protein identification, including low abundant and/or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins.", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "date": "2009-09-22", "authors": ["YongLin", "YanLi", "YiLiu", "WenjunHan", "QuanzeHe", "JianglinLi", "PingChen", "XianchunWang", "SongpingLiang"], "doi": "10.1002/elps.200900070"}

Biofilms of both the individual and combined strains grew on the membrane surfaces to levels of 4.9-7.99 log colony-forming units (CFU) cm(-2) measured by standard plate counting after removing the cells by sonication. More biofilm grew on used polyethersulfone (PES) membranes than on new PES and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Both strains formed good biofilms, although K. B006 formed a denser biofilm than TR002. This corresponded to our previous study on the attachment of these organisms, where K. B006 attached in greater numbers than K. TR002. The dual strains produced a higher biofilm density than single strains on the new membranes. Biofilm density tended to increase with increased whey concentration. The saturated biofilm was approximately 10(8) CFU cm(-2). PES membranes appeared to support biofilm growth less readily than did PVDF membranes and therefore may be the preferred material for UF membranes to reduce problems with microbial colonisation.

The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of the geometry of an element of a 1D-array ultrasound transducer on generating multi-resonance frequency so as to increase the frequency bandwidth of the transducers. A semi-analytical finite-element (SAFE) method is used to model guided wave propagation in multi-layered 1D-array ultrasound transducers. Each element of the array is composed of LiNbO3 piezoelectric material with rectangular or subdiced cross-section. Four-node bilinear finite-elements have been used to discretize the cross-section of the transducer. Dispersion curves showing the dependence of phase and group velocities on the frequency, and mode shapes of propagating modes were obtained for different geometry consurations. A parametric analysis was carried out to determine the effect of the aspect ratio, subdicing, inversion layer and matching layers on the vibrational behavior of 1D-array ultrasound transducers. It was found that the geometry with subdiced cross-section causes more vibration modes compared with the rectangular section. Modal analysis showed that the additional modes correspond to lateral modes of the piezoelectric subdiced section. In addition, some modes have strong normal displacements, which may influence the bandwidth and the pressure field in front of the transducer. In addition, the dispersion curves reveal strong coupling between waveguide modes due to the anisotropy of the piezoelectric crystal. The effect of the matching layers was to cluster extensional and flexural modes within a certain frequency range. Finally, inversion layer is found to have a minor effect on the dispersion curves.

{"title": "Microdrill, CO2-laser, and piezoelectric stapedotomy: a comparative study.", "abstract": "To compare 3 different devices used to perforate the stapes footplate in otosclerotic patients.\nThe study design was a prospective unblinded study. It was conducted at the ENT Department of a general hospital.\nNinety subjects undergoing primary stapedotomy for otosclerosis by a senior surgeon participated. A stapedotomy operation was performed under local anesthesia with reversed sequence of surgical steps. Three different devices were used to perforate the posterior half of the footplate: a microdrill (MD), a CO2 laser (CO2), and a Piezosurgery bone device (PZS). The hole diameter was 0.7 mm. Three consecutive samples of unselected patients were recruited. All patients of each sample were operated with the same device. Main outcome measures were preoperative and postoperative air- (AC) and bone-conduction (BC) audiometry, intraoperative findings, and postoperative complications. Postoperative pure-tone audiometry was done 1 month after surgery.\nThe CO2 laser was used in 30 stapedotomies, the PZS in 30, and the MD was used in 30. Bone-conduction pure-tone averages did not worsen in the MD and CO2 groups. CO2 laser shows a trend toward less residual air-bone gap and more functional gain at low frequencies. Piezosurgery bone device patients lost approximately 10 dB in BC at 4,000 Hz. Significant differences in AC thresholds gain and in the residual air-bone gap were found between groups. Piezosurgery bone device patients had less gain and more residual gap at high frequencies as a result of a slight deterioration of BC threshold. A higher rate of postoperative vertigo was also found in PZS patients.\nThe use of the CO2 laser seems associated with the best functional results, although on a statistical basis, they do not differ significantly from that obtained with the standard MD platinotomy.

{"title": "Study the self cleaning, antibacterial and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 entrapped PVDF membranes.", "abstract": "The modified PVDF membranes were prepared by adding different amounts of TiO(2) particles (0-4 wt.%) into the casting solution. The TiO(2) entrapped PVDF membranes (0-4% PVDF/TiO(2)) were tested for its antibacterial property by using Escherichia Coliform (E. Coli), photoactive property using Reactive Black 5 (RB5) dye and self cleaning (antifouling) properties by fouling using 1% BSA solution. Results showed that TiO(2) addition significantly affects the pore size and hydrophilicity of the PVDF/TiO(2) membrane. This also improves the flux and permeability of modified PVDF/TiO(2) membrane. The results of antibacterial study showed that the composite PVDF/TiO(2) membrane removes E. Coli at a very faster rate than neat PVDF membrane and membrane with 4% TiO(2) possess highest antibacterial property. The RB5 dye removal using PVDF/TiO(2) occurs under UV by photolysis and photocatalysis mechanisms. The rate of RB5 dye color removal was faster as compared to the rate of aromatic ring structure. The resistance study showed 2% TiO(2) membrane having lower fouling resistance as compared to others. The fouling resistance caused by loosely bound protein (R(c)) was lower than the strongly bound protein (R(f)).

When incubated with bacteria for 4 h to 7 days, Nafion film exhibited scarce bacterial adhesion at 6 h, after which the adhesion gradually increasing to relatively low levels. In contrast, significant bacterial adhesion to PVFHFP film was observed at 4 h, and much higher adhesion levels were shown thereafter. Although HEp-2 human cells adhered normally to both films, reaching confluence in 7-8 days, the cells adhered to Nafion appeared more lively and stable than those to PVFHFP. Subcutaneous implantation in mice revealed that Nafion elicited a mild acute inflammatory reaction without chronic inflammation or tissue necrosis, indicating excellent biocompatibility in mice. PVFHFP, however, provoked a moderate and prolonged acute inflammatory response. These differences in the biological characteristics of Nafion and PVFHFP films may be attributable to the differences in the chemical and physical natures of these polymer films. Nafion film provided a sufficiently solid support, expressing a high surface charge density and good water-wettability.

{"title": "Improving tissue preparation for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Part 1: using microspotting.", "abstract": "Nowadays, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) is a powerful technique to obtain the distribution of endogenous and exogenous molecules within tissue sections. It can, thus, be used to study the evolution of molecules across different physiological stages in order to find out markers or get knowledge on signaling pathways. In order to provide valuable information, we must carefully control the sample preparation to avoid any delocalization of molecules of interest inside the tissue during this step. Currently, two strategies can be used to deposit chemicals, such as the MALDI matrix, onto the tissue both involving generation of microdroplets that will be dropped off onto the surface. First strategy involves microspraying of solutions. Here, we have been interested in the development of a microspotting strategy, where nanodroplets of solvent are ejected by a piezoelectric device to generate microspots at the tissue level. Such systems allow one to precisely control sample preparation by creating an array of spots. In terms of matrix crystallization, a microspotting MALDI matrix is hardly compatible with the results by classical (pipetting) methods. We have thus synthesized and studied new solid ionic matrixes in order to obtain high analytical performance using such a deposition system. These developments have enabled optimization of the preparation time because of the high stability of the printing that is generated in these conditions. We have also studied microspotting for performing on-tissue digestion in order to go for identification of proteins or to work from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. We have shown that microspotting is an interesting approach for on tissue digestion.

Functionalized CNTs with polyethylene glycol functions appeared to be the best candidates for printed electronics. This best combination allows us to obtain sheet resistances as low as 225 Omega/sq which is up to now one of the lowest resistances obtained by inkjet printing.

{"title": "Ultrafast microfluidics using surface acoustic waves.", "abstract": "We demonstrate that surface acoustic waves (SAWs), nanometer amplitude Rayleigh waves driven at megahertz order frequencies propagating on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate, offer a powerful method for driving a host of extremely fast microfluidic actuation and microbioparticle manipulation schemes. We show that sessile drops can be translated rapidly on planar substrates or fluid can be pumped through microchannels at 1-10 cms velocities, which are typically one to two orders quicker than that afforded by current microfluidic technologies. Through symmetry-breaking, azimuthal recirculation can be induced within the drop to drive strong inertial microcentrifugation for micromixing and particle concentration or separation. Similar micromixing strategies can be induced in the same microchannel in which fluid is pumped with the SAW by merely changing the SAW frequency to rapidly switch the uniform through-flow into a chaotic oscillatory flow by exploiting superpositioning of the irradiated sound waves from the sidewalls of the microchannel. If the flow is sufficiently quiescent, the nodes of the transverse standing wave that arises across the microchannel also allow for particle aggregation, and hence, sorting on nodal lines. In addition, the SAW also facilitates other microfluidic capabilities. For example, capillary waves excited at the free surface of a sessile drop by the SAW underneath it can be exploited for micronanoparticle collection and sorting at nodal points or lines at low powers. At higher powers, the large accelerations off the substrate surface as the SAW propagates across drives rapid destabilization of the drop free surface giving rise to inertial liquid jets that persist over 1-2 cm in length or atomization of the entire drop to produce 1-10 mum monodispersed aerosol droplets, which can be exploited for ink-jet printing, mass spectrometry interfacing, or pulmonary drug delivery. The atomization of polymerprotein solutions can also be used for the rapid synthesis of 150-200 nm polymerprotein particles or biodegradable polymeric shells in which proteins, peptides, and other therapeutic molecules are encapsulated within for controlled release drug delivery. The atomization of thin films behind a translating drop containing polymer solutions also gives rise to long-range spatial ordering of regular polymer spots whose size and spacing are dependent on the SAW frequency, thus offering a simple and powerful method for polymer patterning without requiring surface treatment or physicalchemical templating.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2009-08-21", "authors": ["Leslie YYeo", "James RFriend"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3056040\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.36.050802.122124\n10.1103/RevModPhys.77.977\n10.1016/S0301-5629(97)00025-2\n10.1063/1.1754276\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.084502\n10.1038/4351045a\n10.1039/b618044b\n10.1039/b403082f\n10.1021/ac0342673\n10.1039/b412712a\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.005\n10.1039/b803967d\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/6/R01\n10.1039/b716321e\n10.1039/b604145k\n10.1063/1.2212275\n10.1063/1.2345590\n10.1063/1.2409629\n10.1063/1.2814054\n10.1063/1.2951467\n10.1063/1.2953537\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/14/145301\n10.1007/s00216-008-1911-5"}

A whirlwind of motion-industry innovation has resulted in an array of new motion options offering significant improvements in application performance, reproducibility and throughput. The challenge to leverage these developments depends on researchers, engineers and motion vendors acquiring a common language of specifications and a shared understanding of the challenges posed by application needs. To assist in building this shared understanding, this article reviews today's motion technologies, beginning with a concise review of key principles of motion control focusing on applications. It progresses through illustrations of sensor/encoder technologies and servo techniques. A spectrum of classical and recent motion technologies is explored, from stepper and servo actuation of conventional microscopy stages, to advanced piezo stack nanopositioners capable of picometer precision, to novel ultrasonic resonant piezomotors and piezo-ceramic-based mechanisms capable of high-force positioning over many millimeters while providing resolutions down into the sub-nanometer range. A special emphasis is placed on the effects of integrating multiple motion technologies into an application, such as stacking a fine nanopositioner atop a long-travel stage. Examples and data are presented to clarify these issues, including important and insightful new stability measurements taken directly from an advanced optical trapping application. The important topics of software and interfacing are also explored from an applications perspective, since design-and-debugging time, synchronization capabilities and overall throughput are heavily dependent on these often-overlooked aspects of motion system design. The discussion is designed to illuminate specifications-related topics that become increasingly important as precision requirements tighten.

A negative piezoelectric output voltage indicates an NW is n-type and it appears after the tip scans across the center of the NW, while a positive output voltage reveals p-type conductivity and it appears before the tip scans across the central line of the NW. This atomic force microscopy based technique is reliable for statistically mapping the majority carrier type in ZnO NWs arrays.

First, a multiresonant polyurea thin-film ultrasonic transducer is fabricated by the vapor deposition polymerization process using 2 monomers. Second, the measurement system of surface acoustic wave velocity modified from the V(z) curve method is established. The system uses the fabricated polyurea thin film as a variable-line-focus transducer at the 30-MHz resonance frequency. The focal length is changed by varying the radius of curvature of the film transducer. To estimate the surface acoustic wave velocities from the measured data theoretically, the photographs of the transducer bent shapes are taken by using a digital microscope, and the bent transducer curvature is modeled by the 7th-order polynomial. To examine the performances of the variable-line-focus transducer, the surface acoustic wave velocities of an aluminum and a synthesized silica glass specimen have been measured.

The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature signals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that performs the required square root operations. The proposed implementation enables flexibility to support different transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the demodulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three implementations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound system for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation. Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architecture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digital multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable software- based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound signals can be processed as well.

In the connection, thermal imbalance between the PTs should be prevented to avoid the thermal runaway of each PT. The thermal balance of the multiple-connected PTs is dominantly affected by the electrothermal characteristics of individual PTs. In this paper, the thermal balance of both parallel-parallel and parallel-series connections are analyzed by electrical model parameters. For quantitative analysis, the thermal-balance effects are estimated by the simulation of the mechanical loss ratio between the PTs. The analysis results show that with PTs of similar characteristics, the parallel-series connection has better thermal balance characteristics due to the reduced mechanical loss of the higher temperature PT.

According to the results obtained by our group, these ceramics can be considered as superior lead-free piezoelectric materials for reducing environmental damage. Perovskite-type ceramics appear to be suitable for actuator and high-power applications that require a large piezoelectric constant d33 and a high Curie temperature TC or a high depolarization temperature Td (> 200 degrees C). In this paper, we summarize the relationship between phase transition temperatures and piezoelectric properties. In the case of the BNT-based solid solutions, the highest piezoelectric properties were obtained at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. However, d33 and Td were shown to have a tradeoff relationship. Considering the high Td and high d33, the tetragonal side of the MPB composition is suitable for piezoelectric actuator application. Meanwhile, the Qm values on the rhombohedral side of the MPB composition were better than those on the tetragonal side, and excellent high-power characteristics were obtained for Mn-doped BNT-(Bi(1/2)Na(1/2))TiO3-BKT ternary systems with rhombohedral symmetry. BKT ceramics were prepared by the hot-pressing (HP) method, and their ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties were clarified. BKT ceramics doped with a small amount of Bi have a relatively high remanent polarization of Pr = 27.6 microC/cm2 and high piezoelectric properties (k33 = 0.40 and d33 = 101 pC/N). In addition, it was clarified that BKT ceramics have a high Td of approximately 300 degrees C.

The base KNN and its compositional derivatives are analyzed in terms of dopant-property relationships, which are then extended to the ternary derivatives. The effects of processing conditions such as humidity, precursor purity, and oxygen partial pressure during sintering are elaborated on from a phenomenological perspective. It is also shown that the spontaneous polarization is sensitive to the processing route chosen for synthesis (mixed oxide versus perovskite routes). Special attention is devoted to the discussion of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) dilemma in the KNN-LT-LS system, where it is shown that the origin of high piezoelectric activity is actually due to a polymorphic transition at room temperature.

{"title": "Comments on origins of enhanced piezoelectric properties in ferroelectrics.", "abstract": "This review discusses recent advances in understanding origins of large piezoelectric properties in some ferroelectric materials. In particular, it addresses the role of polarization rotation and monoclinic phases. It is suggested that the polarization rotation is an old concept that was proposed more than 30 years ago to explain enhanced properties of Pb(Zr,Ti) O3 in the morphotropic phase boundary region. It is further demonstrated that in addition to polarization rotation, polarization extension can also lead to large electro-mechanical properties. In fact, the largest piezoelectric coefficient has been reported in KH2PO4, which exhibits structural instability involving polarization extension and no monoclinic phases. It is also shown that substantial theoretical and experimental evidence exists to show that the highest piezoelectric response is often not observed in monoclinic phases but in the phase transition regions where polarization either changes direction or appears from the nonpolar state. Finally, it is proposed that the concept of free energy instability, which emerged from phenomenological and first principle calculations, is the most general approach that can be used to consistently interpret many experimental observations and underlies many theoretical results on enhancement of piezoelectric properties.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-08-19", "authors": ["DraganDamjanovic"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1222"}

In this work, we report the use of a laboratory X-ray diffractometer for the measurement of various structural changes in tetragonal La-doped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics under the application of static and cyclic electric fields. The changes in the volume fractions of the 90 degrees domains parallel to the electric field direction are calculated from the intensities of the {002} diffraction peaks. In addition, the components of lattice strains are monitored from the changes in the (111) crystallographic planes. It is observed that, under the application of static electric fields, both 90 degrees domain switching and the 111 lattice strains showed similarity with the macroscopic strain-electric field hystersis loop.

By combining the fast response of photothermal cantilever excitation with a conventional piezoactuator, a fast force-clamp with high accuracy and large working distances is reached. Simple feedback mechanisms and standard cantilever geometries lead to step response times of less than 90 micros, which is more than one order of magnitude faster than those of conventional force-clamp systems that are based only on piezo feedback.

The coarsening on the surface and bulk of HFP and its nanocomposite films upon SHI irradiation has been measured quantitatively by using atomic force microscopy.

Acoustic measurement of the bladder volume reduces the need for a urinary catheter. Recently, a new method to non-invasively measure the volume of liquid filled cavities in vivo on the basis of nonlinear wave propagation has been introduced. To implement this method, two different multilayer ultrasound transducers were developed. Both transducers consisted of a first piezo-electric layer of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) to transmit waves at a fundamental frequency (2 MHz) and a second piezo-electric layer (copolymer) to receive a wide range of frequencies including harmonics. To suppress the inherent susceptibility of the film to electromagnetic waves, one of the two transducers, i.e., an \"inverted\" multilayer transducer, had the copolymer layer located inside the structure. The other multilayer transducer, i.e., a \"normal\" multilayer transducer, had the copolymer film located on the outside. Both transducers were compared with a commercially available broadband piezo-composite transducer, with respect to their transmit and receive transfer functions, their pulse-echo responses and their electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS) in reception. It was concluded that to measure up to at least the third harmonic frequency component with good sensitivity in combination with high transmit sensitivity at the fundamental frequency, a multilayer structure is preferred. To optimize for the EMS in reception, and hence also the signal-to-noise ratio, an inverted geometry, as proposed in this paper, was proven to be most effective.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2009-08-04", "authors": ["Egon J WMerks", "Paulvan Neer", "NicolaasBom", "Antonius F Wvan der Steen", "Nicode Jong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2009.05.010"}

EyeSeeCam incorporates active visual exploration by saccades with image stabilization during head, object, and surround motion just as occurs in human ocular motor control. This prototype is a first attempt to combine free user mobility with image stabilization and unrestricted exploration of the visual surround in a man-made technical vision system. The gaze-driven camera is supplemented by an additional wide-angle, head-fixed scene camera. In this scene view, the focused gaze view is embedded with picture-in-picture functionality, which provides an approximation of the foveated retinal content. Such a combined video clip can be viewed more comfortably than the saccade-pervaded image of the gaze camera alone. EyeSeeCam consists of a video-oculography (VOG) device and a camera motion device. The benchmark for the evaluation of such a device is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which requires a latency on the order of 10 msec between head and eye (camera) movements for proper image stabilization. A new lightweight VOG was developed that is able to synchronously measure binocular eye positions at up to 600 Hz. The camera motion device consists of a parallel kinematics setup with a backlash-free gimbal joint that is driven by piezo actuators with no reduction gears.

In this paper, we present the first designs and prototypes of an eight-element, concentric-ring, CMUT array to treat upper abdominal cancers. This array was simulated and designed to focus 30-50 mm into tissue, and ablate a 2- to 3-cm-diameter tumor within 1 h. Assuming a surface acoustic output pressure of 1 MPa peak-to-peak (8.5 W/cm (2)) at 2.5 MHz, we simulated an array that produced a focal intensity of 680 W/cm (2) when focusing to 35 mm. CMUT cells were then designed to meet these frequency and surface acoustic intensity specifications. These cell designs were fabricated as 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm test transducers and used to verify our models. The test transducers were shown to operate at 2.5 MHz with an output pressure of 1.4 MPa peak-to-peak (16.3 W/cm (2)). With this CMUT cell design, we fabricated a full eight-element array.

Audiologic and surgical records analysis.\nEight patients with mixed hearing loss and previous unsuccessful otologic surgeries were recruited. A transcanal or transmastoid approach was used. Round window osteoplasty was performed with the PZS device to implant the VBS floating mass transducer for cochlear stimulation.\nThe osteoplasty was performed safely with PZS, and all patients were successfully implanted. No sensorineural hearing deterioration occurred in all but 1 patient. The postoperative air conduction threshold was slightly higher than preoperatively because of minor middle ear transfer function changes. After fitting, patients continue to wear their speech processors full-time. The aided speech discrimination scores at conversational level ranged from 65 to 100%. Aided hearing threshold was 32.2 dB HL (preoperative threshold under earphones, 62.8 dB HL). One patient affected by congenital aural atresia had a posterior canalithiosis on the operated side that was successfully treated by the repositioning maneuver.\nThe PZS device proved to be effective for RW osteoplasty; floating mass transducer was successfully implanted in all patients. Audiologic results are comparable to those obtained from traditionally operated patients. Relative to conventional drilling, the PZS allows a safer osteoplasty because it does not produce any rotation or torque that reduces the risk of RW membrane injury.

{"title": "Piezosurgery in head and neck oncological and reconstructive surgery: personal experience on 127 cases.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric bone surgery, known simply as piezosurgery, is a new technique of osteotomy and osteoplasty, which requires the use of microvibrations of ultrasonic frequency scalpels. The principle of piezosurgery is ultrasonic transduction, obtained by piezoelectric ceramic contraction and expansion. The vibrations thus obtained are amplified and transferred onto the insert of a drill which, when rapidly applied, with slight pressure, upon the bony tissue, results, in the presence of irrigation with physiological solution, in the cavitation phenomenon, with a mechanical cutting effect, exclusively on mineralized tissues. Personal experience with the use of piezosurgery in head and neck oncological and reconstructive surgery is relatively recent, having been developed in 2002-2006, and, so far, involves 127 cases; preliminary results are interesting and improving in the, hopefully, developmental phases of inserts with specific geometrics on account of the characteristics of the various aspects of surgical ENT operations. Furthermore, with piezoelectric surgery it has been possible to perform precise osteotomy lines, micrometric and curvilinear with absolute confidence, particularly in close proximity to the vessels and nerves and other important facial structures (dura mater). There can be no doubt, since this is a new cutting method, that piezosurgery involves a different learning curve compared to other techniques, requiring obstacles of a psychological nature to be overcome as well as that concerning surgical expertise. Given the numbers of cases treated and the relative power of this instrument, analysis of complications, intra-operative time (which would appear, on average, to be 20% longer) and, therefore, morbility, shows interesting potentiality of the technique. This new ultrasound cutting method will, no doubt, in the future, be increasingly used in ENT surgery, particularly with improvements in power and geometry of the inserts, with possible applications also in neurosurgery, paediatric surgery and orthopedics, branches in which a selective action upon the mineralized tissues is of fundamental importance.\nLa chirurgia ossea piezoelettrica, nota semplicemente con il nome di piezosurgery o piezochirurgia, \u00e8 una nuova tecnica di osteotomia ed osteoplastica, che prevede l\u2019impiego di microvibrazioni di scalpelli a frequenza ultrasonica. Il principio di funzionamento della piezosurgery \u00e8 una trasduzione ultrasonica, ottenuta mediante la contrazione e l\u2019espansione di una ceramica piezoelettrica. Le vibrazioni cos\u00ec prodotte sono amplificate e trasferite sull\u2019inserto di un trapano che, applicato rapidamente e con lieve pressione sul tessuto osseo, determina, in presenza di irrigazione con soluzione fisiologica, il fenomeno della cavitazione, con un\u2019azione meccanica di taglio esclusiva sui tessuti mineralizzati. La nostra esperienza personale di utilizzo della piezosurgery nella chirurgia maggiore (oncologica e non) e ricostruttiva del distretto cervico-cefalico \u00e8 relativamente recente, essendosi sviluppata negli anni 2002-2006. Abbiamo impiegato la piezosurgery in 127 casi; le impressioni preliminari risultano interessanti e passibili di miglioramenti nell\u2019auspicabile fase di sviluppo di inserti a geometria specifica per le caratteristiche dei vari interventi chirurgici ORL. Nella nostra esperienza, la chirurgia piezoelettrica ci ha consentito di eseguire linee di osteotomia precise, micrometriche e curvilinee in assoluta sicurezza, soprattutto in prossimit\u00e0 dei fasci vascolo-nervosi e di altre strutture nobili del massiccio facciale (dura madre). Indubbiamente la piezosurgery rappresenta, a nostro avviso, una nuova opzione chirurgica per eseguire osteotomie nell\u2019ambito della chirurgia cervico-cefalica, anche se ulteriori miglioramenti dovranno essere apportati per consentire alla metodica di diffondersi e raccogliere consensi. Indubbiamente la piezochirurgia \u00e8 una metodica di taglio innovativa, pertanto richiede una differente curva di apprendimento rispetto alle altre tecniche. Infatti il corretto utilizzo della piezosurgery prevede il superamento di ostacoli di ordine psicologico e di manualit\u00e0 chirurgica.

A nostro parere questa nuova metodica di taglio ad ultrasuoni potr\u00e0 trovare in futuro uno spazio sempre maggiore in ambito otorinolaringoiatrico e maxillo-facciale, specie migliorando potenze e geometrie degli inserti, con possibili applicazioni anche nel campo della neurochirurgia, della chirurgia pediatrica e dell\u2019ortopedia, discipline in cui un\u2019azione selettiva sui tessuti mineralizzati risulta fondamentale.", "journal": "Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale", "date": "2009-07-18", "authors": ["ECrosetti", "BBattiston", "GSucco"], "doi": null}

Systematic study of cell's mechanical responses has relied greatly on the in-vitro experiments due to complexity of internal environment of bone cells in vivo. A loading device suitable to hard scaffolds for studying mechanical responses of bone cells was made by using a kind of long-travel, high-load piezoelectric actuator. The device, which was precisely controlled by computer, and designed to work in an incubator at 37 degrees C and 100% humidity, can cause hard scaffolds with directly compressive strains with more magnitudes, frequency components, and waveforms, including bone physiologically mechanical state. The experiment using hard scaffolds indicates the device validity. The device represents a versatile model that will provide conditions for investigating the effects of mechanical responses on bone cells in 3D hard scaffolds in vitro. In addition, the preliminary biological test was performed by the application of the device. The results showed that the dynamic compression with the amplitude of 1000 microstrain, the frequency of 3 Hz, the duration of 3 min/day enhanced the osteoblastic proliferation and extracellular matrix compared with static conditions, and improved the cell distribution within scaffolds.

However, dynamic monitoring of nucleic acid amplifications with traditional DNA sensors in real-time is difficult since a constant temperature must be maintained during detection. Thus, the piezoelectric sensor, one type of traditional DNA sensor, is not applicable in real-time monitoring PCR due to the dramatic change in temperature that occurs during reaction. In this study, we introduced strand displacement amplification (SDA), an well-developed nucleic acid amplification technique that can work under conditions of constant temperature, into the development of a novel piezoelectric sensor. Using the new SDA-piezoelectric DNA sensor, we designed a stable system for liquid-phase detection, in which the crystal oscillator plate was fixed by an easily adjustable screw-threaded clamping mechanism and successfully applied the new sensor system to real-time SDA monitoring of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

We then evaluated the performance of LDV for ultrasonic waveform measurements in physical model experiments that are employed for modeling seismic observations. For such experiments, the characteristics of the source and detector should be exactly known. Disc-shaped compression and shear-mode piezoelectric transducers were attached on a flat surface of a steel semicircular column, and ultrasonic waves were excited by single-shot sine waves with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 MHz frequencies. Radial and transverse components were measured by LDV at a distance of 150 mm from the source. The maximum amplitudes of waves with respect to radiation angle give a radiation pattern of a transducer. Each observed radiation pattern was fitted to the calculated radiation pattern by assuming a harmonically oscillating stress distributed uniformly on a flat circular area. The observed radiation patterns show fairly good agreement with the calculated radiation patterns for both radial and transverse components when the source frequencies are 0.25 and 0.5 MHz. Because the best-fit stress values were independently estimated from the radial and the transverse radiation patterns, the 2 stress values should be equal for each source and frequency. The discrepancy between the estimated radial and transverse stress values becomes larger as the source frequency increases. Provided that coincidence of the 2 stress values indicates the validity of waveform measurements, the results suggest that LDV is applicable for measuring the 3-D particle-velocity at frequencies up to 0.5 MHz.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-07-04", "authors": ["YoFukushima", "OsamuNishizawa", "HaruoSato"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1199"}
{"title": "Analyses of power output of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices directly connected to a load resistor using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method.", "abstract": "This paper presents, for the first time, a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element model (CPC-FEM) to analyze the power output of a vibration-based piezoelectric energy-harvesting device (EHD) when it is connected to a load resistor. Special focus is given to the effect of the load resistor value on the vibrational amplitude of the piezoelectric EHD, and thus on the current, voltage, and power generated by the device, which are normally assumed to be independent of the load resistor value to reduce the complexity of modeling and simulation. The presented CPC-FEM uses a cantilever with a sandwich structure and a seismic mass attached to the tip to study the following characteristics of the EHD as a result of changing the load resistor value: 1) the electric outputs: the current through and voltage across the load resistor; 2) the power dissipated by the load resistor; 3) the displacement amplitude of the tip of the cantilever; and 4) the shift in the resonant frequency of the device. It is found that these characteristics of the EHD have a significant dependence on the load resistor value, rather than being independent of it as is assumed in most literature. The CPC-FEM is capable of predicting the generated output power of the EHD with different load resistor values while simultaneously calculating the effect of the load resistor value on the displacement amplitude of the tip of the cantilever. This makes the CPC-FEM invaluable for validating the performance of a designed EHD before it is fabricated and tested, thereby reducing the recurring costs associated with repeat fabrication and trials.

With applied E(max) = 10 kV/cm unipolar drive, the maximum axial displacement (u(33)) produced by the uncapped and capped PE-MBLC is 11 and 21 microm, respectively. The hysteresis in unipolar u(33) at 0.5 E(max) is 4.6% for the uncapped PE-MBLC, while that for the capped one is 11%. Under bipolar excitation, the maximum u(33) for uncapped is 11.6 microm at +E(max) and 6.6 microm at +E(max) with an asymmetry factor (zeta) of 1.75 for which u(33) < 0 for all E < 0.

Three polymers (polyethylene (PE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)) containing various amounts of hydrogen and fluorine were treated with an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). While surface modification was observed on the PE and the PVDF in a pure N2 discharge, adding H2 in a N2 discharge was necessary to observe the fluorine etching on the surface of the PVDF and PTFE polymers. The presence of a slight amount of hydrogen in the gas mixture was also a prerequisite to the formation of amino groups on the surface of all three polymers (max NH2/C approximately 5%). Aging revealed that the modified polymer surfaces treated in a N2-H2 discharge were less prone to hydrophobic recovery than were surfaces treated in pure N2, due primarily to the presence of a higher density of polar groups on the surfaces. We demonstrated that H atoms in the discharge are necessary for the surface amine functionalization of polymers in a N2 atmospheric pressure DBD, regardless of polymer chemical composition. It is therefore possible to control the plasma functionalization process and to optimize the concentration and specificity of NH2 grafted onto polymer surfaces by varying the H2 concentration in a N2 atmospheric pressure DBD.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2009-07-04", "authors": ["ChristianSarra-Bournet", "GuylaineAyotte", "St\u00e9phaneTurgeon", "Fran\u00e7oiseMassines", "Ga\u00e9tanLaroche"], "doi": "10.1021/la900652y"}

Self-sensing method, based on the electric charge measurement, may represent a solution in terms of cost-effectiveness and integration, the actuator performing simultaneously as its own sensor. This paper presents a self-sensing method dedicated to free uni- and bimorph piezocantilevers but can also be adapted to other piezoactuator types. The integrated electric current, used to convert the charge, can be compensated against piezoelectric material nonlinearities to provide accurate displacement information. The advantages relative to existing self-sensing methods consist in the ability to keep this displacement information for long-term periods (more than a thousand seconds) and in the reduction in signal noise.

{"title": "Making a commercial atomic force microscope more accurate and faster using positive position feedback control.", "abstract": "This paper presents experimental implementation of a positive position feedback (PPF) control scheme for vibration and cross-coupling compensation of a piezoelectric tube scanner in a commercial atomic force microscope (AFM). The AFM is a device capable of generating images with extremely high resolutions down to the atomic level. It is also being used in applications that involve manipulation of matter at a nanoscale. Early AFMs were operated in open loop. Consequently, they were susceptible to piezoelectric creep, thermal drift, hysteresis nonlinearity, and scan-induced vibration. These effects tend to distort the generated image and slow down the scanning speed of the device. Recently, a new generation of AFMs has emerged that utilizes position sensors to measure displacements of the scanner in three dimensions. These AFMs are equipped with feedback control loops that work to minimize the adverse effects of hysteresis, piezoelectric creep, and thermal drift on the obtained image using proportional-plus-integral (PI) controllers. These feedback controllers are often not designed to deal with the highly resonant nature of an AFM's scanner nor with the cross coupling between various axes. In this paper we illustrate the improvement in accuracy and imaging speed that can be achieved by using a properly designed feedback controller such as a PPF controller. Such controllers can be incorporated into most modern AFMs with minimal effort since they can be implemented in software with the existing hardware. Experimental results show that by implementing the PPF control scheme, relatively good images in comparison with a well-tuned PI controller can still be obtained up to line scan of 60 Hz.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2009-07-02", "authors": ["I AMahmood", "S O RezaMoheimani"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3155790"}

The PQCI parameters, such as resonant frequency (f), static capacitance (C(s)), and motional resistance (R(m)) were measured for investigating the kinetic adsorption behaviors of both proteins. The change in frequency shifts (Deltaf) depends on the amount of the adsorbed protein, and the change in motional resistance (DeltaR(m)) results from the microporosity variation of HAP/CS coating. The results show that the amount of the absorbed HSA is much greater than that of OVA on HAP/CS coating because of the unique construction of HSA as well as a flexible protein. Furthermore, Deltaf and DeltaR(m) data were fitted according to the kinetic exponential decay equations. It can be seen that there is only one adsorption process for OVA, but the absorption process for HSA is followed by a rearrangement process, and the former process is faster than the rearrangement process.

{"title": "Mental workload when driving in a simulator: effects of age and driving complexity.", "abstract": "Driving errors for older drivers may result from a higher momentary mental workload resulting from complex driving situations, such as intersections. The present study examined if the mental workload of young and older active drivers vary with the difficulty of the driving context. We adopted the probe reaction time (RT) technique to measure the workload while driving in a simulator. The technique provided clear instructions about the primary (driving) and secondary (RT) tasks. To avoid structural interference, the secondary task consisted of responding as rapidly as possible with a vocal response (\"top\") to an auditory stimulus. Participants drove through a continuous 26.4-km scenario including rural and urban sections and probes (stimuli) were given in a baseline static condition and in three different driving contexts embedded into the overall driving scenario. Specifically, stimuli were given randomly when (a) driving on straight roads at a constant speed, (b) approaching intersections for which the driver had to stop the car, and (c) when overtaking a slower vehicle. Unless a driving error was made, drivers did not need any emergency responses. Reaction time was defined as the temporal interval between the auditory stimulus and the onset of the corresponding verbal response detected from the analog signal of a piezo-electric microphone fixed on a headset (ms accuracy). Baseline RTs were similar for both groups. Both groups showed longer RTs when driving and RTs increased as the complexity of the driving contexts increased (driving straights, intersections, overtaking maneuvers). Compared to younger drivers, however, older drivers showed longer RTs for all driving contexts and the most complex driving context (overtaking maneuvers) yielded a disproportionate increase. In conclusion, driving leads to a greater mental workload for the older drivers than for the younger drivers and this effect was exacerbated by the more complex driving context (overtaking maneuvers).", "journal": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "date": "2009-06-23", "authors": ["VincentCantin", "MartinLavalli\u00e8re", "MartinSimoneau", "NormandTeasdale"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2009.03.019"}

Correlating the time of rib fractures with the kinematics of the occupant and the action of safety systems would provide valuable data for assessing safety systems and developing injury risk functions. However, methods for determining rib fractures timing are not yet fully developed. Time-history analysis of data from multiple strain gauges mounted directly to ribs is commonly used for this purpose, but this method is not very sensitive and the time and cost required to instrument the rib cage with more than 100 strain gauges is prohibitive for many applications. In this study a new approach based on time-scale analysis of signals obtained from piezoelectric transducers (PZT) is reported. A post-mortem human subject was instrumented with four PZT on ribs 3 and 7 bilaterally and exposed to lateral blunt impacts to the shoulder and the chest. The fractures were documented after each test, and a criterion was developed to process the PZT signals. The criterion consists in detecting in the PZT signal the onset of a high frequency transient generated by the fracture of a rib using the continuous wavelet transform. Two thresholds were successfully determined to detect fractures that occurred (1) on an instrumented rib, and (2) on the adjacent rib. Further development of this method should allow the detection of all rib fractures using only a few PZT.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2009-06-23", "authors": ["FGabrielli", "DSubit", "EOgam", "PGuillemain", "R WKent", "CMasson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.007"}

Cell growth platforms with controlled content, geometry and spatial distribution of bioactive and stem cell attractive areas were fabricated either by micro-contact printing or piezoelectric spotting of polycationic biomolecules or extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) on cell-repellent surfaces. HUCB-NSCs were shown to adhere, differentiate and respond to neurotoxic MeHgCl on functional domains in a manner dependent on protein type and concentration, cell density and serum conditions. While receptor-mediated interactions with ECM proteins under absence of serum promote neuronal differentiation, non-specific adhesion to polycationic molecules maintain cells attached to the surface in non-differentiated stage. Functional domains were further engineered to create \"smart\" microenvironment by immobilizing to the surface signaling molecules together with ECM proteins. Stimulation of selected intracellular pathways by molecules of Wnt, Shh, CNTF or Notch type resulted in differentiation of HUCB-NSC to either neuronal or astroglial lineage. Sensor techniques applied to HUCB-NSC included measurements of electrical activity using multielectrode array chips. Spontaneous electrical field potentials of HUCB-NSCs were dependent upon developmental stage of tested cells.

The innovative system consists of a multimodal broadband piezoelectric transducer based on polyvinylidene fluoride polymer integrated into a textile belt wrapped around the chest. An advanced electronic control unit, floating power supply, and wireless communication support make it suitable for portable monitoring during critical cardiopulmonary failures. The multimodal transducer is innovative in that only one sensitive element is employed to work as either an ultrasound (US) transceiver or piezoelectric sensor. The US transceiver is enabled to work at high frequency, i.e., it is excited by suitable pulses to emit an ultrasonic wave, which penetrates the body and receives the echo signals bouncing off the biological interfaces having different acoustic impedances. The piezoelectric sensor works at low frequency and acquires both signals generated by heart apex movements and the mechanical movement of the chest induced by respiration. This multimodality is allowed by a broadband of sensitivity jointly at a low value of the figure of merit (Q). Moreover, the transducer thickness is thin enough to assure a good adaptability to the biological site, and it is equipped with an advanced control unit enabling to switch from a high to a low working frequency.

Five 20-s continuous objective recordings of the accommodative response, measured with an open-view IR autorefractor (Shin-Nippon SRW-5000), were obtained for a variety of open- and closed-loop accommodative demands while simultaneous continuous measurement of heart rate was recorded with a finger-mounted piezo-electric pulse transducer for 5 min. Fast Fourier Transformation of cardiovascular function allowed the absolute and relative power of the autonomic components to be assessed in the frequency-domain, whereas heart period gave an indication of the time-domain response.\nIncreasing closed-loop accommodative demand led to a concurrent increase in heart rate of approximately 2 beats/min for a 4.0 D increase in accommodative demand. The increase was attributable to a reduction in the absolute (p < 0.05) and normalised (p < 0.001) input of the systemic parasympathetic nervous system, and was unaffected by refractive group. The interaction with refractive group failed to reach significance.\nFor sustained accommodation effort, the data demonstrate covariation between the oculomotor and cardiovascular systems which implies that a near visual task can significantly influence cardiovascular behaviour.

For a microbelt growing along the c-axis, a shear stress in the a-c plane can be induced when an electric field E is applied along the a-axis of the wurtzite structure. As amplified by the large aspect ratio of the microbelt that grows along the c-axis, the strain localized near the root can be detected via the transverse deflection perpendicular to the ZnO microbelt.

These drawbacks lead to intense research efforts to develop biosensor devices for the determination of these compounds. In this review, we present an overview of the actual development of research in neurotoxin detection by using enzymatic biosensors based on esterase activity, in particular cholinesterases, and carboxylesterases. Detection by enzymatic activity could be carried out measuring the hydrolysis products or the residual enzymatic activity after inhibition, using a transducer system that makes possible the correlation between the determined activity and the analyte concentration. Several transducer systems were adopted for the neurotoxins identification using esterases, including electrochemical, optical, conductimetric and piezoelectric procedures. The differences in the used transducer determine the final sensitivity and specificity of the biosensor. Moreover, a brief description of immobilization procedure, that is an important step in the biosensor development and could affect the final characteristic of biosensor (sensibility, stability, response time and reproducibility), was accomplished.

The transduction mechanism is based on the detection of acoustically- and thermally-induced thickness changes in a polymer film Fabry-Perot interferometer deposited at the tip of a single mode optical fiber. The sensor provides a peak noise-equivalent pressure of 15 kPa (at 5 MHz, over a 20 MHz measurement bandwidth), an acoustic bandwidth of 50 MHz, and an optically defined element size of 10 microm. As well as measuring acoustic pressure, temperature changes up to 70 degrees C can be measured, with a resolution of 0.34 degrees C. To evaluate the thermal measurement capability of the sensor, measurements were made at the focus of a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) field in a tissue mimicking phantom. These showed that the sensor is not susceptible to viscous heating, is able to withstand high intensity fields, and can simultaneously acquire acoustic waveforms while monitoring induced temperature rises. These attributes, along with flexibility, small physical size (OD approximately 150 microm), immunity to Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI), and low sensor cost, suggest that this type of hydrophone may provide a practical alternative to piezoelectric based hydrophones.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2009-06-11", "authors": ["PaulMorris", "AndrewHurrell", "AdamShaw", "EdwardZhang", "PaulBeard"], "doi": "10.1121/1.3117437"}

With high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy, we probed piezoelectric behavior in relevant biological samples at different scale levels: from the subfibrillar structures of single isolated collagen fibrils to bone. We revealed that, beyond the general understanding of collagen fibril being a piezoelectric material, there existed an intrinsic piezoelectric heterogeneity within a collagen fibril coinciding with the periodic variation of its gap and overlap regions.

The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) has become a significant sensor for both liquid and gas phase graviometry due to its high sensitivity, robustness, ease of use and simultaneous electrochemistry capabilities. One key factor plaguing the QCM in most sensor applications is the stability of the surface functionalisation. Diamond offers the most stable surface for functionalisation, the widest electrochemical window and the lowest noise floor. Unfortunately the growth of diamond on QCMs is problematic due to the low curie point of quartz, resulting in the loss of the piezoelectric properties of the QCM.

{"title": "Generation of chimeras by microinjection.", "abstract": "Since the technique of introducing a targeted mutation ('gene targeting') into the mouse genome was published almost 20 years ago (Cell 51:503-512, 1987), the number of mouse mutants (mouse models) is increasing, especially after the advent of the full mouse genomic sequence in 2002 and the human genomic sequences in 2003 that reveals more and more large stretches of similarity between the two species at the genomic level. This chapter describes the tools and the experimental route of targeted manipulation by microinjection in the mouse using targeted embryonic stem cells (ES cells).The techniques have become standardized over recent years (Nature 309:255-256, 1984; Practical Approach.

Academic Press, San Deigo, 2002; Manipulating the Mouse Embryo - A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2003) and basically two methods have been used to generate chimeric mice that transmit the mutation of interest via the ES cell genome to the offspring:Microinjection of ES cells into blastocyst or morula stage embryos (this chapter) or aggregation of ES cells with morula stage embryos (see Chapter 14 ).Microinjection of ES cells into the blastocoel (cavity) of the blastocyst stage embryo and also morula injections using micropipettes driven by micromanipulators require sophisticated manual skills and an expensive phase contrast inverted microscope. Although most commonly used, it is quite expensive to establish this technique in a laboratory, in particular, if piezo- or laser- supported routes come into play. Although the establishment of germ-line potent ES cells was first published in 1981 (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 78:7634-7636, 1981; Nature 292:154-156, 1981), up to now it has not been possible to establish germ-line transmitting ES cells from any other mammalian species, not even from rat which is closely related, nor was it possible to introduce targeted mutations by different means to the germ-line of mammals. After 20 years, the mouse is still the only mammalian species where mutations can be introduced in a targeted manner and therefore it is very important to many fields in biology, like immunology, neurobiology, and developmental biology to study gene function and disease.

The droplet generator with a flexible nozzle plate, which is free to vibrate due to the pressure acting on the plate, is modeled in a CFD computational domain. The CFD analysis includes the fluid-structure interaction between fluid and a flexible plate using large deflection theory. The problem is characterized by the nondimensional variables based on the capillary parameters of time, velocity, and pressure. The CFD model is validated with the experiment results. This study examines the characteristics of the applied waveforms and nozzle plate material properties to change the vibrational characteristics of the nozzle plate. The effect of fluid properties on the droplet formation process is also investigated focusing on surface tension and viscous forces. Increasing the impulse of the piezoelectric can be used to cause a higher droplet velocity and it is shown that the vibration of the nozzle plate has a strong effect on the droplet velocity, shape, and volume. Surface tension has a strong influence on the droplet formation characteristics in contrast to viscous forces. For the combination of a fluid with high surface tension and the most flexible nozzle plate, this system cannot cause the droplet ejected out of the nozzle.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2009-06-09", "authors": ["SSangplung", "J ALiburdy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.077"}

The fast read-out of large (multiple cm(2)) glass slides as used in modern chip technology imposes severe constraints on the focal system. The limited focal depth of high-NA objectives together with the demand for single-molecule sensitivity challenges traditional focus-hold systems. Various long- and short-term effects disturb the often multiple hour-long data-acquisitioning process and cause blurred or unusable image data. Traditional focus-hold systems were often limited in terms of range, reaction time, sensitivity or demanded a large number of additional components. Our system uses the back-reflected illumination beam always present in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to generate an error proportional electrical signal, which in turn drives an actuator correcting the objective-sample distance. The latter consists of a fast but range-limited piezo drive attached to the objective and a slower motor coupled to the microscope's z-drive. With this combination, fast reaction times and virtually unlimited correction distances are possible.

{"title": "Development of a bioactive paper sensor for detection of neurotoxins using piezoelectric inkjet printing of sol-gel-derived bioinks.", "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in new strategies to rapidly detect analytes of clinical and environmental interest without the need for sophisticated instrumentation. As an example, the detection of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as neurotoxins and organophosphates has implications for neuroscience, drug assessment, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. Functionalization of surfaces with multiple reagents, including enzymes and chromogenic reagents, is a critical component for the effective development of \"dipstick\" or lateral flow biosensors. Herein, we describe a novel paper-based solid-phase biosensor that utilizes piezoelectric inkjet printing of biocompatible, enzyme-doped, sol-gel-based inks to create colorimetric sensor strips. For this purpose, polyvinylamine (PVAm, which captures anionic agents) was first printed and then AChE was overprinted by sandwiching the enzyme within two layers of biocompatible sol-gel-derived silica on paper. AChE inhibitors, including paraoxon and aflatoxin B1, were detected successfully using this sensor by measuring the residual activity of AChE on paper, using Ellman's colorimetric assay, with capture of the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate (TNB(-)) product on the PVAm layer. The assay provided good detection limits (paraoxon, approximately 100 nM; aflatoxin B1, approximately 30 nM) and rapid response times (<5 min). Detection could be achieved either by eye or using a digital camera and image analysis software, avoiding the need for expensive and sophisticated instrumentation. We demonstrate that the bioactive paper strip can be used either as a dipstick or a lateral flow-based biosensor. The use of sol-gel-based entrapment produced a sensor that retained enzyme activity and gave reproducible results after storage at 4 degrees C for at least 60 days, making the system suitable for storage and use in the field.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2009-06-06", "authors": ["S M ZakirHossain", "Roger ELuckham", "Anne MarieSmith", "Julie MLebert", "Lauren MDavies", "Robert HPelton", "Carlos D MFilipe", "John DBrennan"], "doi": "10.1021/ac900660p"}

This is much larger than if utilizing the acoustic radiation force acting directly on particles, where the limitation in maximum displacement is between a node and an antinode which at 10 MHz is 35 microm.

{"title": "Coupled analysis of high and low frequency resonant ultrasound spectroscopy: application to the detection of defects in ceramic balls.", "abstract": "A coupled analysis of high and low frequency resonant ultrasound spectroscopy of spheroidal modes is presented in this paper. Experimentally, by using an ultrasonic probe for the excitation (piezoelectric transducer) and a heterodyne optic probe for the receiver (interferometer), it was possible to take spectroscopic measurements of spheroidal vibrations over a large frequency range of 100 kHz-45 MHz in a continuous regime. This wide analysis range enabled variations in velocity due to the presence of defects to be differentiated from the inherent characteristics of the balls and consequently, it offers the possibility of detecting cracks independently of production variations. This kind of defect is difficult to detect because the C-shaped surface crack is very small and narrow (500 x 5 microm(2)), and its depth does not exceed 50 microm. The proposed methodology can excite spheroidal vibrations in the ceramic balls and detect such vibrations over a large frequency range. On the one hand, low frequency resonances are used in order to estimate the elastic coefficients of the balls according to various inspection depths. This method has the advantage of providing highly accurate evaluations of the elastic coefficients over a wide frequency range.

In addition, the efficiency and rate of TCE dechlorination increased upon increasing the mass loading of Ni, ranging between 2.5 and 20 wt%, and then decreased when further increased the Ni loading to 25 wt%. In addition, the stability and longevity of the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles was evaluated by repeatedly injecting TCE into the solutions. A rapid and complete dechlorination of TCE by trace amounts of Fe/Ni nanoparticles was observed after 16 cycles of injection within 10 days, indicating that the immobilization of Fe/Ni nanoparticles in the hydrophilic nylon 66 membrane can retain the longevity and high reactivity of nanoparticles towards TCE dechlorination.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2009-05-30", "authors": ["Ganesh KParshetti", "Ruey-AnDoong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2009.04.037"}

{"title": "Theoretical analysis of ultrasonic vibration spectra from multiple particle-plate impacts.", "abstract": "Many industrial processes involve particles in a carrier fluid, and it is often of interest to monitor the size of these particles noninvasively. The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of multiple particle-wall impact vibrations that can be used to recover the particle size from experimental data. These vibrations have been measured by an ultrasonic transducer attached to the exterior of a vessel containing a stirred-particle-laden fluid. A linear systems model is derived for the response of the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer, which has a single matching layer. The acceleration power spectrum of these vibrations has been shown experimentally to contain information on the size of the impacting particle. In particular, the frequency of the main spectral lobe is inversely proportional to the particle size. We present a theoretical model that agrees with this empirically observed phenomenon. The theoretical model is then used to simulate multiple particle-wall impacts, with each particle impacting at a randomly chosen location. A set of theoretical vibration spectra arising from multiple particle-wall impacts are integrated and compared with the experimental data. The ability of this approach to distinguish between different particle sizes is clearly shown.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-05-29", "authors": ["GillianCarson", "Anthony JMulholland", "AlisonNordon", "AnthonyGachagan", "GordonHayward"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1135"}

Ground reaction force (GRF) measurement is a relevant approach to study the interaction between the hoof and the ground. Force plates are not adapted to compare different surfaces at high speed. A 3D dynamometric horseshoe (DHS), using 4 triaxial piezoelectric sensors, has been developed and validated.\nTo use the DHS to compare the effects of 2 track surfaces, an all-weather waxed track and a crushed sand track, on the GRF in trotter horses under training conditions.\nThe right forelimb of 3 French Trotters was equipped with the DHS. Two tracks were tested in a straight line: a crushed sand track (S) and an all-weather waxed track (W). For each session, trials were repeated 3 times in a Latin square design. The speed of the runs was set at 10 m/s and recorded synchronously. For each trial, data acquisition was performed at 600 Hz and 10 consecutive strides were analysed. Statistical differences were tested using a general linear model procedure.\nThe amplitude of the maximal longitudinal braking force (Fx) was significantly lower on W compared to S. This event happened about 6% later in the stance phase on W. The magnitude of the GRF at impact decreased on W. The average speed and the mean stance phase duration were not statistically different on both surfaces. The stride length was about 6 cm longer on S.\nThis study demonstrates the ability and sensitivity of the DHS to discriminate track surfaces by measuring the GRF at high speed.

A limitation with the ELISPOT assay is that it can only be used to detect a single protein of interest. Recently, the ELISPOT technique has been modified to use fluorophores allowing multiple secreted proteins to be detected simultaneously. This technique has greatly enhanced the ability to identify cells secreting multiple proteins, but has not been used to its fullest potential. We wished to accurately quantify the expression of antigen-specific antibody from a single plasma cell and to determine whether plasma cells recovered from different locations had different secretion rates. To achieve this we analyzed fluorospot images quantitatively using Mira MX 7 UL Astronomy software, and coupled this data with a quantitative ELISA to determine secretion rates from individual cells. Using this technique we were able to determine that plasma cells recovered from the peripheral blood secreted the most antibody (1.667 ng/cell/12 h) while splenic antibody secreting cells the least (0.399 ng/cell/12 h). We were able to quantify a 150 fold difference in antibody secretion between cells, with most plasma cells divided into two groups, low secretors (<0.1 ng/cell) or high secretors (>2 ng/cell).

Although it is known that the shear-induced crystallization behavior of nanocomposites can be significantly affected by the presence of nanoparticles, the effects of the incorporation of carbon nanotubes on the deformation-induced crystallization and associated morphology development of PVDF have not been previously investigated. Here the dynamics of the shear-induced crystallization of carbon nanotubes incorporated in PVDF were investigated using simple shear flow. The shear-induced crystallization behavior was affected by the deformation rate, temperature, and the concentration of the carbon nanotubes. Time-dependence of linear viscoelastic properties indicated that the presence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in PVDF greatly altered the shear-induced crystallization kinetics of PVDF, while no significant changes in crystallization behavior were observed for pure PVDF samples sheared under similar conditions. Upon increase of the concentration of the MWNTs the crystal size of PVDF decreased while its rate of crystallization increased in conjunction with an increase of the beta phase crystallization. Overall, these findings suggest that the shear-induced crystallization of PVDF nanocomposites (and in general flow-induced crystallization effects associated with the thermo-mechanical history experienced by the nanocomposite during processing) should be integral parts of attempts to generate a comprehensive understanding of the development of the microstructural distributions and the coupled ultimate properties of polymer nanocomposites.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2009-05-21", "authors": ["GauravMago", "Frank TFisher", "Dilhan MKalyon"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2009.vc08"}

The alpha- to beta-phase transformation was achieved in the polymer matrix and a maximum of approximately equal to 70% of beta-PVDF was reached at 80 degrees C and a stretching ratio of 400%. The dielectric constant of the nanocomposites increases with increasing metal nanoparticle concentration, up to approximately equal to 26 at 0.020 wt% Ag content.

{"title": "The factors behind the morphotropic phase boundary in piezoelectric perovskites.", "abstract": "The best piezoelectric materials are solid solutions in the vicinity of the steep morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) separating rhombohedral and tetragonal phases in the composition-temperature plane. A classical example is the lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr(x)Ti(1-x))O(3), PZT] system, with x approximately 0.52, where the two phases are separated by a boundary extending from the lowest temperatures up to several hundred degrees. The origin of the boundary has been under keen studies for 40 years. Recent interest is largely due to the need to develop new, lead-free piezoelectrics, for which a natural starting point is to understand the properties of the present systems. Here, we demonstrate, through high-pressure (up to 8 GPa) neutron powder diffraction experiments and density functional theory computations on lead titanate (PbTiO(3), PT), that it is the competition between two factors which determines the MPB. The first is the oxygen octahedral tilting, giving advantage for the rhombohedral R3c phase, and the second is the entropy, which in the vicinity of the MPB favors the tetragonal phase above 130 K. If the two factors are in balance over a large temperature range, a steep phase boundary results in the pressure-temperature plane.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

{"title": "In situ characterization of a cold and short pulsed molecular beam by femtosecond ion imaging.", "abstract": "In this paper we report on the in situ characterization of the cold velocity distribution of a pulsed molecular beam produced by a novel cantilever piezo valve. The velocity distribution is measured at various temporal positions within the pulsed expansion using femtosecond velocity map ion imaging. It is shown that the universal detection of molecules by multi-photon femtosecond velocity map ion imaging can provide directly the velocity distribution with excellent velocity resolution. The novel cantilever piezo valve can operate both in continuous (DC) and pulsed mode without any modification using the same drive electronics. Pulsed operation was tested at repetition rates of 20 Hz, 1 kHz and 5 kHz and a conical nozzle 200 mum in diameter. The cantilever valve produces a pulsed molecular beam of translationally cold molecules at modest backing pressures of about 6 bar. At low to medium repetition rates (20-1000 Hz) the pulsed piezo valve produces pulses of 12-40 mus duration of translationally cold seeded beams of helium and neon with speed ratios up to S = 135 (20 Hz, 0.1% CD(3)I in neon) and S = 55 (1 kHz). At the highest tested repetition rate of 5 kHz, the speed ratio obtained for the same seeded beam is reduced to about S = 45. This is still more than a factor of two better than the speed ratio S = 21 measured for a continuous beam produced with the same nozzle at 0.5 bar backing pressure. The cold velocity distribution of the pulsed beam expansion as compared to a continuous beam expansion is beneficial for improved spatial resolution in velocity map ion imaging experiments at high repetition rates of 1-5 kHz. The cantilever piezo valve has a simple design and may find broad applicability in areas where short gas pulses are warranted because of limited pumping speed, the effective use of (expensive) samples or the production of translationally and internally cold molecular beams at high repetition rate. When operating the piezo valve at high backing pressures of 15-30 bar extensive clustering of the low percentage (0.1-0.5%) seeded molecules in He and Ne carrier gasses can be produced of interest for cluster research.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2009-05-15", "authors": ["DanielIrimia", "RobKortekaas", "Maurice H MJanssen"], "doi": "10.1039/b822960k"}

Two separated fast and slow waves were clearly observed in 16 specimens, mainly in the main load direction. The waveforms and the sound speeds of fast and slow waves were similar to the reported data in bovine bone. The group of specimens in which the two waves were observed did not exhibit statistically higher apparent density than the rest of the specimens, but did exhibit statistically higher acoustic anisotropy ratio. The speeds in the main load direction were higher than those in the other direction. The fast and slow wave speeds were in good agreement with Biot's model, showing an increase with bone volume fraction (BV/TV). The ratio of peak amplitudes of the fast and slow waves nonlinearly increased as a function of BV/TV.

The MR results are compared to results obtained from conventional rheological experiments on the same samples using a rotational rheometer as well as a piezo-driven squeeze flow apparatus. Good agreement between MR results probing the local rheological properties and those obtained by the conventional methods measuring the macroscopic mechanical response is found in the whole frequency range.

Aim of this study was to investigate the long-term wear behavior of 12 commercial alumina-on-alumina bearings under severe conditions: different angles of inclination (23 degrees, 45 degrees, and 63 degrees) and the addition of third body particles (titanium and alumina powder) to address the effective role of cup position and ceramic particles on wear and hip noise. The study was performed using a 12-stations hip joint wear simulator (Shore Western, Monrovia) under bovine calf serum used as lubricant. Wear was evaluated by gravimetric method and the piezo-spectroscopic technique was used to evaluate the residual stress of the ceramic components and correlate this to the weight loss. After eight million cycles, we found that the inclination of the cup (63 degrees in this study) was the most disadvantaged and it was correlated with a hip noise. Gravimetric measurements showed higher wear than the other configurations and these results were in agreement with the Photoluminescence investigation. In particular, the results obtained in this work revealed a residual stress state greater not only with respect to the other angles of inclination but also to two retrieved alumina acetabular cups with a 10 years follow-up.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Using a thermodynamic model and taking into account polarization charge screening in the electrodes and the near-surface inhomogeneous polarization distribution, the tunneling conductance is calculated as a function of the applied stress. It is found that reversing an applied stress can also change the tunnel barrier sufficiently to produce an effect similar to the giant electro-resistance one due to polarization reversal, which is particularly significant near the stress-dependent paraelectric/ferroelectric phase transition.

Their eventual performance will strongly depend on the available displacement current, which primarily scales with the area but might to some extent be enhanced by substrate-induced homogeneous strain while the interface at the same time controls the coercive field. As the lateral dimensions persistently decrease, the only way to keep track of the real figures of merit with realistic electrodes is to use a macroscopic configuration instead of scanning probe approaches with undefined interfaces. We report on a novel approach to integrating arbitrarily patterned, highly registered ferroelectric nanoislands fabricated by a template controlled chemical solution deposition approach into a matrix of a low-k dielectric spin-on glass. These structures with a narrow lateral size distribution below 100 nm are subsequently polished in a chemical-mechanical polishing step to expose their very tops, whose piezoelectrically active area depends on the polishing time. At this stage our findings indicate a full piezoelectric functionality of the locally exposed nanoislands.

{"title": "Optical calibration for both out-of-plane and in-plane displacement sensitivity of acoustic emission sensors.", "abstract": "The use of piezoelectric sensors for acoustic emission (AE) monitoring provides an extremely sensitive detection method of AE events. The sensors are used to detect the stress waves, resulting from an AE event, which arrive at the surface of a structure. The sensors provide high sensitivity, and are generally based on a high-Q design where the sensor is used to detect AE events around its resonance. Sensitivity calibration of these sensors is essential for accurate assessment of the AE measurement and particularly important for sensors mounted on safety critical structures. This paper proposes an optical method which enables both the out-of-plane and in-plane displacement sensitivity of an AE sensor to be established independently from each other. In the method, a laser homodyne interferometer is used to measure the out-of-plane and in-plane displacement of the surface of a large test block excited by a repeatable source transducer. The out-of-plane displacement is measured by aligning the laser beam perpendicular to the surface with time gating of the receive waveform used to isolate only the direct arrival of the longitudinal wave produced by the piston source transducer. For the in-plane displacement measurement, the laser beam is aligned parallel to the surface to intersect a small optically reflective step with the time waveform being gated to measure only the direct shear arrival produced using a normal incidence shear wave source transducer. In each case, the interferometer measurement is followed by coupling the sensor under test to the measurement surface, which is then exposed to the same acoustic field and the sensor output signal measured. This substitution method allows the sensor sensitivity to be obtained in terms of volts per unit displacement for both the out-of-plane and the in-plane surface displacement. The method provides a comprehensive description of an AE sensor response to different planes of displacement and offers the potential for a traceable sensor calibration to units of length.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2009-05-05", "authors": ["P DTheobald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2009.03.004"}

Cross-axis coupling effect generally exists in piezoscanners used for three-dimensional (x-y-z axes) nanopositioning in applications such as AFM, where the vertical z-axis movement can be generated by the lateral x-y axes scanning. Such x/y-to-z cross-coupling becomes pronounced when the scanning is at large range and/or at high speed. In AFM applications, the coupling-caused position errors, when large, can generate various adverse effects, including large imaging and topography distortions, and damage of the cantilever probe and/or the sample. This paper utilizes the IIC technique to obtain the control input to precisely track the coupling-caused x/y-to-z displacement (with sign-flipped). Then the obtained input is augmented as a feedforward control to the existing feedback control in tapping-mode imaging, resulting in the cancellation of the coupling effect. The proposed approach is illustrated through two exemplary applications in industry, the pole-tip recession examination, and the nanoasperity measurement on hard-disk drive.

The motivation for this research is that some applications in medical ultrasound (e.g. third harmonic transmit phasing and contrast imaging) need probes which are sensitive around both the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies, and that these higher harmonic thickness modes, although often considered as undesired, might be used beneficially. The novelty aspect in this study is the presented transmit and receive potential at both the fundamental and third harmonic of a conventional cardiac probe with modified electrical tuning. Elements of an experimental PZT-based phased-array probe (f(c)=3 MHz, 64 elements, element width=0.3mm, elevation aperture=13 mm) were electrically retuned with series inductors around the third harmonic resonance frequency at 10 MHz. Hydrophone measurements with 10-MHz-tuned elements showed that, as compared to a conventionally tuned element, the transmit transfer function at the third harmonic increased more than 23 dB, while the sensitivity at the fundamental frequency was only 6 dB lower. Pulse-echo measurements showed that the two-way transfer function of a 10-MHz-tuned element resulted in 20 dB increased sensitivity around the third harmonic as compared to an untuned element. Simulated transfer functions, from both a 1D KLM and 2D finite element model of an element of the experimental array transducer, confirmed the measured sensitivity peaks at the fundamental and third harmonic.

Filtration tests using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyethersulphone (PES) and cellulose acetate (CA) membranes were conducted to investigate the contribution of different organic fractions to membrane fouling. The results show that in filtration of raw water, flux declines with PES, PVDF and CA membrane are 67%, 59% and 19% of the initial flux, indicating that the more hydrophobic membrane resulted in more severe fouling. For the effect of different fractions on flux, flux decline with neutral hydrophilic is 41%-75% of the initial flux, whereas weakly hydrophobic acids is 6%-33%, suggesting that neutral hydrophilic has a great impact on filtration flux. Among three membranes tested, CA membrane shows the lowest flux decline compared with other membranes in spite of rejection of as high as 14.69% of neutral hydrophilic, suggesting that the extent of flux decline may not be associated with the total amount of NOM removed. The mechanism of fouling was discussed and found that the neutral hydrophilic fraction with greater than 3 x 10(4) of molecular weight caused a significant flux decline, through blocking the pore for the MF or UF having greater relative molecular mass cut-off (MWCO), but resulted in a little impact on flux with the UF having lower MWCO, through forming cake layer on the surface of membrane due to not entering the inside of pore.", "journal": "Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue", "date": "2009-05-01", "authors": ["Xian-JiaoZhou", "Bing-ZhiDong"], "doi": null}

According to the Torrent-Guasp myocardial band theory, this phase results from the contraction of the final portion of the myocardial band: the ascending segment of the apical loop. The objectives were to study the myocardial mechanisms influencing transmitral flow during early diastole and to determine whether the rapid ventricular filling phase involves contraction or relaxation.\nAn experimental in vivo pig model was used. Regional contractility in three segments of the myocardial band was assessed using piezoelectric crystals and mitral flow was measured by echo-Doppler ultrasonography at baseline and after akinesia had been induced in the ascending segment by 2.5% formaldehyde infusion. Changes in intracavitary pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium and flow alterations in the aortic root were recorded. The start of the isovolumic relaxation phase was identified using the time at which the ejection of blood ceases, as indicated by aortic flow measurements.\nDuring the left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation phase, the ascending segment of the apical loop was undergoing contraction. The infusion of formaldehyde into this segment affected the extent to which the intraventricular pressure could decrease, prolonged the isovolumic relaxation phase and resulted in a lower minimum pressure. It also produced a significant decrease in transmitral flow velocity in early diastole and an increase at end-diastole.\nThe rapid ventricular filling phase is characterized by contraction.", "journal": "Revista espanola de cardiologia", "date": "2009-04-30", "authors": ["Juan ACos\u00edn Aguilar", "AmparoHern\u00e1ndiz Mart\u00ednez", "M TeresaTuz\u00f3n Segarra", "JaimeAg\u00fcero Ram\u00f3n-Llin", "FranciscoTorrent-Guasp"], "doi": "10.1016/s1885-5857(09)71666-4"}

Using the rigid pseudo-ion method for the cubic zinc-blende and hexagonal wurtzite structures, the anisotropic deformation potentials are derived from the electronic structure, the atomic pseudopotential and the full phonon dispersion and eigenvectors for both acoustic and optical modes. Several different electronic structure and lattice dynamics models are compared, as well as different models for the interpolation of the atomic pseudopotentials required in the rigid pseudo-ion method. Piezoelectric as well as anisotropic polar optical phonon scattering is accounted for as well. In terms of high field transport, the peak velocity is primarily determined by deformation potential scattering described through the rigid pseudo-ion model. The calculated velocity is compared with experimental data from pulsed I-V measurements. Good agreement is found using the rigid ion model to the measured velocity-field characteristics with the inclusion of dislocation and ionized impurity scattering. The crystal orientation of the electric field is investigated, where very little difference is observed in the velocity-field characteristics. We simulate the effects of nonequilibrium hot phonons on the energy relaxation as well, using a detailed balance between emission and absorption during the simulation, and an anharmonic decay of LO phonons to acoustic phonons, as reported previously. Nonequilibrium phonons are shown to result in a significant degradation of the velocity-field characteristics for high carrier densities, such as those encountered at the AlGaN/GaN interface due to polarization effects.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

Proteins are separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane.

The detected proteins are then processed by on-blot digestion and identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. A transcription factor, bound by a specific radiolabeled element, is thus characterized without aligning with protein spots on a gel. In this study, we systematically optimize conditions for 2D-SW and on-blot digestion. By quantifying the SW signal using a scintillation counter, the optimal conditions for SW were determined to be PVDF membrane, 0.5% PVP40 for membrane blocking, serial dilution of guanidine HCl for denaturing and renaturing proteins on the blot, and an SDS stripping buffer to remove radiation from the blot. By the quantification of the peptide yields using nano-ESI-MS analysis, the optimized conditions for on-blot digestions were found to be 0.5% Zwittergent 3-16 and 30% acetonitrile in trypsin digestion buffer.

Among these is the Ro RNP particle, composed of a 60,000 molecular weight protein (Ro 60 or SS-A) that is noncovalently associated with at least one of four short uridine-rich RNAs (the hY RNAs). Our earlier work demonstrated that multiple antigenic peptides (MAPs) constructed from the sequence of the Ro 60 autoantigen could be used, using double immunodiffusion studies, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, affinity chromatography, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to show intramolecular and intermolecular protein-protein interaction within the Ro 60 RNP particle. We also found that calcium is important in mediating this interaction. We hypothesized, therefore, that the Ro 60 antigen is a calcium binding protein. To investigate this we used Ro 60 MAPs and assayed calcium binding using the Quin-2 system. Several Ro 60 MAPs were found to bind calcium using this assay, as well as bovine serum albumin, another calcium binding protein. However, a MAP constructed from the Sm autoantigen did not bind to calcium. These data, along with our observation regarding the involvement of calcium in the protein-protein interaction occurring between Ro 60 antigen and Ro 60 MAPs, make us propose that the Ro 60 antigen is a calcium binding protein.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2009-04-21", "authors": ["Biji TKurien", "MichaelBachmann"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-59745-542-8_49"}
{"title": "Protein stains to detect antigen on membranes.", "abstract": "Western blotting (protein blotting/electroblotting) is the gold standard in the analysis of complex protein mixtures. Electroblotting drives protein molecules from a polyacrylamide (or less commonly, of an agarose) gel to the surface of a binding membrane, thereby facilitating an increased availability of the sites with affinity for both general and specific protein reagents. The analysis of these complex protein mixtures is achieved by the detection of specific protein bands on a membrane, which in turn is made possible by the visualization of protein bands either by chemical staining or by reaction with an antibody of a conjugated ligand. Chemical methods employ staining with organic dyes, metal chelates, autoradiography, fluorescent dyes, complexing with silver, or prelabeling with fluorophores. All of these methods have differing sensitivities and quantitative determinations vary significantly. This review will describe the various protein staining methods applied to membranes after electrophoresis. \"Detection\" precedes and is a prerequisite to obtaining qualitative and quantitative data on the proteins in a sample, as much as to comparing the protein composition of different samples.

{"title": "Vibration measurement of a miniature component by high-speed image-plane digital holographic microscopy.", "abstract": "Measuring deformation of vibrating specimens whose dimensions are in the submillimeter range introduces a number of difficulties using laser interferometry. Normal interferometry is not suitable because of a phase ambiguity problem. In addition, the noise effect is much more serious in the measurement of small objects because a high-magnification lens is used. We present a method for full-field measurement of displacement, velocity, and acceleration of a vibrating miniature object based on image-plane digital holographic microscopy. A miniature cantilever beam is excited by a piezoelectric transducer stage with a sinusoidal configuration. A sequence of digital holograms is captured using a high-speed digital holographic microscope. Windowed Fourier analysis is applied in the spatial and spatiotemporal domains to extract the displacement, velocity and acceleration. The result shows that a combination of image-plane digital holographic microscopy and windowed Fourier analyses can be used to study vibration without encountering a phase ambiguity problem, and one can obtain instantaneous kinematic parameters on each point.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2009-04-14", "authors": ["YuFu", "HongjianShi", "HongMiao"], "doi": "10.1364/ao.48.001990"}

With respect to blank polymer, superior conductive, capacitive, and viscoelasitic properties of the composite were demonstrated. Composition of pyr-SWCNTs was determined by thermogravimetric analyses, which showed one molecule of 1-pyrenebutiric acid per approximately 20 carbon atoms of SWCNT. Atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that pyr-SWCNTs form tangles of pyr-SWCNTs bundles surrounded by globular clusters of the C60-Pd polymer. Peaks characteristic of both pyr-SWCNTs (radial breathing modes at approximately 200 to 300 cm(-1)) and C60-Pd polymer in the Raman spectra recorded for the composite confirmed the presence of pyr-SWCNTs in the composite film. The mass of the deposited film was in situ measured by piezoelectric microgravimetry with the use of an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). Then, curves of the current, resonant frequency change, and dynamic resistance change versus the potential in different potential ranges were simultaneously recorded in a blank acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. Specific capacitance, determined at -1.20 V for the composite as 90 F g(-1), was twice as high as that for the polymer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to determine impedance parameters of both the C60-Pd polymer and C60-Pd/pyr-SWCNTs composite film.

The feasibility of a micro-machined ultrasonic transducer as an efficient finite-amplitude wave projector was studied. A piezoelectric micro-machined ultrasonic transducer array consisting of lead zirconate titanate uni-morph elements was designed and fabricated for this purpose. Theoretical and experimental evaluations showed that a micro-machined ultrasonic transducer array can be used as an efficient source transducer for a parametric array in air. The beam patterns and propagation curves of the difference frequency wave and the primary wave generated by the micro-machined ultrasonic transducer array were measured. Although the theoretical results were based on ideal parametric array models, the theoretical data explained the experimental results reasonably well.

In this work, we present the screening of virus filters of varying configurations and materials of construction using MAb solutions with a concentration range of 4-20 g/L. For our MAbs of interest-two different humanized IgG1s-flux decay was not observed up to a filter loading of 200 L/m(2) with a regenerated cellulose hollow fiber virus removal filter. In contrast, PVDF and PES flat sheet disc membranes were plugged by solutions of these same MAbs with concentrations >4 g/L well before 50 L/m(2). These results were obtained with purified feed streams containing <2% aggregates, as measured by size exclusion chromatography, where the majority of the aggregate likely was composed of dimers. Differences in filtration flux performance between the two MAbs under similar operating conditions indicate the sensitivity of the system to small differences in protein structure, presumably due to the impact of these differences on nonspecific interactions between the protein and the membrane; these differences cannot be anticipated based on protein pI alone.

{"title": "Piezo- and Flexoelectric Membrane Materials Underlie Fast Biological Motors in the Ear.", "abstract": "The mammalian inner ear is remarkably sensitive to quiet sounds, exhibits over 100dB dynamic range, and has the exquisite ability to discriminate closely spaced tones even in the presence of noise. This performance is achieved, in part, through active mechanical amplification of vibrations by sensory hair cells within the inner ear. All hair cells are endowed with a bundle of motile microvilli, stereocilia, located at the apical end of the cell, and the more specialized outer hair cells (OHC's) are also endowed with somatic electromotility responsible for changes in cell length in response to perturbations in membrane potential. Both hair bundle and somatic motors are known to feed energy into the mechanical vibrations in the inner ear. The biophysical origin and relative significance of the motors remains a subject of intense research. Several biological motors have been identified in hair cells that might underlie the motor(s), including a cousin of the classical ATP driven actin-myosin motor found in skeletal muscle. Hydrolysis of ATP, however, is much too slow to be viable at audio frequencies on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Heuristically, the OHC somatic motor behaves as if the OHC lateral wall membrane were a piezoelectric material and the hair bundle motor behaves as if the plasma membrane were a flexoelectric material. We propose these observations from a continuum materials perspective are literally true. To examine this idea, we formulated mathematical models of the OHC lateral wall \"piezoelectric\" motor and the more ubiquitous \"flexoelectric\" hair bundle motor. Plausible biophysical mechanisms underlying piezo- and flexoelectricity were established. Model predictions were compared extensively to the available data. The models were then applied to study the power conversion efficiency of the motors. Results show that the material properties of the complex membranes in hair cells provide them with the ability to convert electrical power available in the inner ear cochlea into useful mechanical amplification of sound induced vibrations at auditory frequencies. We also examined how hair cell amplification might be controlled by the brain through efferent synaptic contacts on hair cells and found a simple mechanism to tune hearing to signals of interest to the listener by electrical control of these motors.", "journal": "Materials Research Society symposia proceedings.

Piezoelectric and magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler probes were placed into contact against polished dentin samples (100 g/200 g). Resulting tooth surfaces were evaluated with a laser metrology system. Ultrasonic instrumentation produced an indentation directly related to the bodily movement of the probe as it made an impact on the surface. Load, generator power, and probe cross-section significantly affected probe vibration and defect depth/volume. Defect dimensions were independent of generator type.

There were differences in flux among ceramic UTP, ceramic GP, and polymeric SW microfiltration membranes (54.08, 71.79, and 16.21 kg/m2 per hour, respectively) when processing skim milk at 50 degrees C in a continuous bleed-and-feed 3x process. These differences in flux among the membranes would influence the amount of membrane surface area required to process a given volume of milk in a given time. Further work is needed to determine if these differences in flux are maintained over longer processing times. The true protein contents of the microfiltration permeates from UTP and GP membranes were higher than from SW membranes (0.57, 0.56, and 0.38%, respectively). Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-PAGE gels for permeates revealed a higher casein proportion in GP and SW permeate than in UTP permeate, with the highest passage of casein through the GP membrane under the operational conditions used in this study. The slight cloudiness of the permeates produced using the GP and SW systems may have been due to the presence of a small amount of casein, which may present an obstacle in their use in applications when clarity is an important functional characteristic. More beta-lactoglobulin passed through the ceramic membranes than through the polymeric membrane.

Valves show excellent dispensing properties for UHV alginate in concentrations of 0.4% and 0.7% and also for aqueous liquids. An optimized process flow provides excellent handling of biological samples under sterile conditions. This technique allows the encapsulation of adherent cells and structuring of substrates for biotechnology and regenerative medicine. A variety of cell lines showed at least 70% viability after encapsulation (including cell lines that are relevant in regenerative medicine like Hep G2), and time-lapse analysis revealed cells proliferating and showing limited motility under alginate spots. Cells show metabolic activity, gene product expression, and physiological function. Encapsulated cells have contact with the substrate and can exchange metabolites while being isolated from macromolecules in the environment.

Experiments were conducted at various gas flow rates, liquid flow rates, and absorbent concentrations. The CO(2) absorption flux increased with increasing gas flow rates and absorbent concentrations. When using 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) or AMP+PZ aqueous solution as absorbent, this process was dominantly governed by gas film layer diffusion and membrane diffusion. The diffusion resistance of the membrane phase was only important when using N-methyldiethanolamine as the sole absorbent. The water contact angle increased initially with increasing plasma working power and reached at steady state value of 155 degrees beyond 100 W. The elemental fluorine-to-carbon ratio (F/C) and water contact angle of the PVDF membrane increased with increasing treatment time and reached a plateau after 5min of CH(4) plasma (100 W).

From a clinical perspective, this \"law\" is supported by the strong association between bone density and physical activity. From a mechanistic standpoint, however, the law presents a challenge to scientists seeking to understand how osteocytes and osteoblasts sense the mechanical load. In the 1960s, collagen piezoelectricity was invoked as a potential mechanism by which osteocytes could detect areas of greater stress but piezoelectricity diminished in importance as more compelling mechanisms, such as streaming potential, were identified. In addition, accumulating evidence for the role of fluid-related shear stress in osteocyte's mechanosensory function has made piezoelectricity seemingly more obsolete in bone physiology. This review critically evaluates the role of collagen piezoelectricity (if any) in Wolff's Law--specifically, the evidence regarding its involvement in strain-generated potentials, existing alternate mechanisms, the present understanding of bone mechanosensation, and whether piezoelectricity serves an influential role within the context of this newly proposed mechanism.

{"title": "Selective histamine piezoelectric chemosensor using a recognition film of the molecularly imprinted polymer of bis(bithiophene) derivatives.", "abstract": "A histamine piezoelectric (acoustic) sensor using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film has been devised and tested. The sensor comprises an electrodeposited MIP film as the recognition element and a 10 MHz AT-cut shear-thickness-mode bulk-acoustic-wave quartz crystal resonator with Pt film electrodes as the signal transducer. Preparation of the sensing film involved two consecutive electrochemical polymerizations, performed under cyclic voltammetric conditions, with the use of a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile. First, a poly(bithiophene) barrier film was deposited by electropolymerization on the Pt/quartz resonator to prevent histamine electro-oxidation and avoid possible contamination of the Pt electrode surface. Next, the histamine-templated MIP film was deposited by electropolymerization on top of this barrier film. For that purpose, two functional monomers of bis(bithiophene) derivatives, i.e., one bearing the 18-crown-6 and the other dioxoborinane substituent, were copolymerized in the presence of the histamine template. The consecutive growth of both these overlaid films was monitored with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). Subsequently, the histamine was extracted from MIP with 0.01 M NaOH for 12 h. The UV-vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements confirmed the completeness of the removal of the histamine template from the MIP film. The analytical performance of the chemosensor was assessed under flow injection analysis (FIA) conditions using the carrier 0.5 M HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5) solution and the piezoelectric microgravimetry detection at QCM. The negative peaks of resonant frequency linearly decreased with the increase of the histamine concentration in the range 10-100 mM for 150 microL/min flow rate, and 100 microL volume of the injected sample. The sensitivity of the chemosensor (0.33 Hz/mM) was more than twice as that of the chemosensor without the poly(bithiophene) barrier film (0.15 Hz/mM). The chemosensor performance was superior for selective histamine recognition if the poly(bithiophene) barrier film thickness exceeded 200 nm. The chemosensor discriminated histamine from functionally or structurally similar compounds, such as dopamine, tryptamine, and imidazole. Stability constants of the affinity complexes of MIP and analyte or the interfering agent were determined from kinetic studies. For the MIP-histamine complex, the stability constant thus evaluated was equal to 57.0 M(-1) being much higher than those for the MIP-tryptamine and MIP-dopamine complexes determined to be 10.7, and 6.4 M(-1), respectively.

There were highly statistically significant (P <0.0001) positive correlations between CBIB and ELISA data for all three biomarkers.

The transducer has an annular geometry, with the thickness of the piezoelectric material increasing from the center to the outside. This single-element annular transducer (SEAT) can provide a broader frequency range than a conventional single-element transducer with a uniform thickness (single-element uniform transducer, or SEUT). We compared the characteristics of a SEAT and a SEUT. Both transducers used 36 degrees-rotated, Y-cut lithium niobate (LiNbO(3)) material. The SEAT had a diameter of 6 mm and comprised 6 subelements of equal area (electrically connected by a single electrode on each side) whose thickness ranged from 60 microm (center) to 110 microm (outside), which resulted in the center frequency of the subelements varying from 59.8 MHz to 25 MHz. The overall center frequency was 42.4 MHz. The annular pattern was constructed using an ultrasonic sculpturing machine that reduced the root-mean-square value of the surface roughness to 454.47 nm. The bandwidth of the SEAT was 19% larger than that of the SEUT. However, compared with the SEUT, the 2-way insertion loss of the SEAT was increased by 3.1 dB. The acoustic beam pattern of the SEAT was also evaluated numerically by finite-element simulations and experimentally by an ultrasound beam analyzer. At the focus (10.5 mm from the transducer surface), the -6 dB beam width was 108 microm. There was reasonable agreement between the data from simulations and experiments. The SEAT can be used for imaging applications that require a wider transducer bandwidth, such as harmonic imaging, and can be manufactured using the same techniques used to produce transducers with multiple frequency bands.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-03-03", "authors": ["Jian-HungLiu", "Sheng-YungChen", "Pai-ChiLi"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1047"}

Due to its moderate longitudinal piezoelectric charge coefficient (175 pC/N) and k(t) of 0.50, the KNN-LT-LS composition may be a good candidate for high frequency transducer applications. PZT fibers with 25 microm diameter formed by the viscose suspension spinning process were incorporated into epoxy to fabricate 1-3 composites with the averaged k(t) = 0.64 and d(33) = 400 pC/N. Using KNN-LS-LT ceramic, 1-3 PZT fiber composite, and PVDF film, 3 different unfocused single element transducers with center frequencies of 25 MHz were fabricated. The acoustic characterization of the transducers demonstrated that wideband and low insertion loss could be obtained employing KNN-LS-LT ceramic. The -6 dB bandwidth and insertion loss were 70% and -21 dB, respectively. In comparison, the insertion loss of the ceramic transducer was much smaller than those made with 1-3 composite and PVDF film.

{"title": "Radiation-resistant behavior of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/layered silicate nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has been made radiation-resistant through a nanocomposite (NC) route. The bombardment of high-energy swift heavy ions (SHI) on PVDF and its NCs with layered silicate has been studied in a range of fluences. The degradation of PVDF after SHI irradiation is suppressed radically in NCs. PVDF forms an intercalated nanostructure in the presence of nanoclay and, further, the ion fluence raises the extent of intercalation. The crystallinity and the heat of fusion of pristine PVDF have drastically been reduced after SHI irradiation, while there are relatively small changes in NCs even at higher fluences. The metastable piezoelectric beta form of PVDF gets stabilized by the presence of layered silicate, and the structure is retained upon SHI irradiation. The clay platelets act as nucleating agents, and SHI irradiation causes two crystallization temperatures for the samples exposed to high fluences. The damages created on the surface and bulk of PVDF and its NC films upon SHI irradiation have been measured quantitatively by using atomic force microscopy. The pitting dimensions and degradation are enhanced significantly beyond 10(11) ions/cm(2) fluence for pristine PVDF, which limits the use of PVDF for any ion irradiation application.

Thus, indirect competitive immunoassay technique had been used for the detection of the target and gold nanoparticles (GNP) been employed as a 'weight label' to the secondary antibody for amplifying the response. This method is proven in its ability to detect AFB(1) down to a level of 0.01 ng mL(-1) in artificially contaminated milk, which is comparable to or even exceeding the sensitivity of microtitre plate ELISA. Furthermore, the frequency responses of the immunoassay are linearly correlated to the logarithm of AFB(1) concentration in the range of 0.1-100 ng mL(-1).

{"title": "Ancient ubiquitous protein 1 and Syk link cytoplasmic tails of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3).", "abstract": "It is currently accepted that activity of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) is modulated by direct interaction between its cytoplasmic tails (CTs) and association of cytoplasmic proteins with them, and disruption of the close linkage between CTs leads to activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) (inside-out signaling). We previously reported that ancient ubiquitous protein (Aup1) binds to the membrane-proximal sequence of integrin alphaCTs that plays a pivotal role in the inside-out signaling. To explore biological function of Aup1, we examined in this study interaction of Aup1 with Src and Syk that are quickly activated in platelets before fibrinogen binding following thrombin stimulation. By immunoprecipitation assay with resting platelets, we first found that alpha(IIb)beta(3), Src, Syk, and Aup1 are constitutively complexed. In vitro binding study with recombinant Syk and glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GST) - Src, -Aup1, and -alpha(IIb) and - beta(3) CTs that are immobilized to GSH- beads revealed direct binding of Syk to Aup1 as well as the beta(3) CT. Dot blot analysis with synthetic peptides for alpha(IIb) and beta(3) CTs, and GST-Aup1 and -Src immobilized to PVDF membrane exhibited concordant result with the GST pull-down assay. Immunoprecipitation of platelet lysates 10 seconds after thrombin stimulation, when activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk are maimum, exhibited that active Syk does not coprecipitate with Aup1. In vitro kinase assay with GST-Syk and -Aup1 proteins at the presence or absence of active Src, a potent activator of Syk, revealed that Aup1 does not directly influence activation of Syk by autophosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. These results indicate that Aup1 is an adaptor recruiting Syk to the alpha(IIb) CT, and suggest that the alpha(IIb) -Aup1- Syk- beta(3) complex formation links alpha(IIb) and beta(3) CTs to sustain alpha(IIb)beta(3) in an inactive state and Syk dissociates from Aup1 after activation.", "journal": "Platelets", "date": "2009-02-24", "authors": ["AtsushiKato", "KazuoOshimi"], "doi": "10.1080/09537100802641507"}

To simplify the injection procedure, we have optimized the conventional blastocyst injection method, free of laser- or piezo-assisted micromanipulation systems, to produce F0 ES cell pups. To increase the efficiency of producing mice from ES cell injection into eight-cell and blastocyst stage embryos, we have tested: 1) the effect of activating ES cell before injection, 2) the effect of in vitro culture in medium optimized for the survival of both ES cells and embryos, and 3) the effect of transferring the micromanipulated embryos into the oviduct versus into the uterus of CD1 foster mice. Two B6D2 hybrid ES cell lines were used for injection in a multifactorial analysis to evaluate the efficiency of producing live chimeric and F0 ES cell mice. Our results demonstrate that the activation of ES cells and the appropriate culture conditions are crucial parameters influencing the generation of F0 ES cell offspring. Transfer of blastocysts injected with ES cells into the oviduct of 0.5-day postcoitum pseudopregnant females increased the number of live animals with higher chimera proportion. Under these conditions, injections into eight-cell embryos produce a high number of F0 ES mice, and the conventional blastocyst injection method produces a lower number of F0 ES cell pups; however, the efficiency of production of chimeric mice with germline transmission was high.

{"title": "A dual-layer transducer array for 3-D rectilinear imaging.", "abstract": "Very large element counts (16,000-65,000) are required for 2-D arrays for 3-D rectilinear imaging. The difficulties in fabricating and interconnecting 2-D arrays with a large number of elements (>5,000) have limited the development of suitable transducers for 3-D rectilinear imaging. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a dual-layer transducer array design. This design consists of 2 perpendicular 1-D arrays for clinical 3-D imaging of targets near the transducer. These targets include the breast, carotid artery, and musculoskeletal system. This transducer design reduces the fabrication complexity and the channel count, making 3-D rectilinear imaging more realizable. With this design, an effective N x N 2-D array can be developed using only N transmitters and N receivers. This benefit becomes very significant when N becomes greater than 128, for example. To demonstrate feasibility, we constructed a 4 x 4 cm prototype dual-layer array. The transmit array uses diced PZT-5H elements, and the receive array is a single sheet of undiced P[VDF-TrFE] copolymer. The receive elements are defined by the copper traces on the flexible interconnect circuit. The measured -6 dB fractional bandwidth was 80% with a center frequency of 4.8 MHz. At 5 MHz, the nearest neighbor crosstalk of the PZT array and PVDF array was -30.4 +/- 3.1 dB and -28.8 +/- 3.7 dB, respectively. This dual-layer transducer was interfaced with an Ultrasonix Sonix RP system, and a synthetic aperture 3-D data set was acquired. We then performed offline 3-D beamforming to obtain volumes of nylon wire targets. The theoretical lateral beamwidth was 0.52 mm compared with measured beamwidths of 0.65 mm and 0.67 mm in azimuth and elevation, respectively. Then, 3-D images of an 8 mm diameter anechoic cyst phantom were also acquired.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2009-02-14", "authors": ["Jesse TYen", "Chi HyungSeo", "Samer IAwad", "Jong SJeong"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1020"}

Although it is possible to measure a multitude of allergen-specific IgE antibodies by radio or enzyme immunoassays in the patients' blood, these tests are expensive, time-consuming, and usually need a rather high volume of reagent solutions (allergens and blood). Protein microarrays offer the possibility to circumvent these limitations. The described in vitro allergy testing system is based on microscopic glass slides activated with glycidyloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane. Allergen solutions (allergen extracts and/or purified allergens; approximately 10 nL) are printed on the activated glass surface with a piezoelectric spotting machine. The protein components of the allergen solutions are immobilized on the modified glass surface via hydrophobic interaction and/ or covalent binding. After a blocking step, the slides are incubated with the respective diluted serum sample (approximately 25 microL serum required) and bound IgE antibodies are detected with a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled anti-human-IgE antibody via chemiluminescence. The measurement can be performed automatically with the so called PASA system. Test results are directly visualized with a CCD-camera. Analytical and clinical data have shown that the microarray-based test format offers significant advantages in time and costs compared with traditional test formats. The described allergen microarray demonstrated a sufficient qualitative reproducibility and enabled the distinction between allergic and non-allergic patients.

We have evaluated the pulse arrival time (PAT) to the capillary bed, through the microcirculation, and have investigated its relationship to the arterial PAT to a fingertip. To do so, we detected cardiac-induced pulse waves in skin microcirculation using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Using the ECG as a reference, PATs to the microcirculation were measured on the four extremities of 108 healthy subjects. Simultaneously, PATs to the radial artery of the left index finger were obtained from blood pressure recordings using a piezoelectric sensor. Both PATs correlate in similar ways with heart rate and age. That to the microcirculation is shown to be sensitive to local changes in skin perfusion induced by cooling. We introduce a measure for the PTT through the microcirculation.

Several electronic designs, including piezoresistive, piezoelectric, and capacitive approaches, have been applied to measure the bending or frequency change of the MCLs upon exposure to chemicals. This review summarizes mechanical, fabrication, and electronics approaches to increase the sensitivity of microcantilever (MCL) sensors.", "journal": "Acta mechanica Sinica = Li xue xue bao", "date": "2009-02-01", "authors": ["Madhu Santosh KuMutyala", "DeepikaBandhanadham", "LiuPan", "Vijaya RohiniPendyala", "Hai-FengJi"], "doi": "10.1007/s10409-008-0222-6"}

Coagulant activity around platelet thrombi was detected using a FITC-conjugated antibody against the fibrin monomer complex (F-405). Intra-cytosolic calcium ion concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in individual platelets and the volume of thrombi were detected with an ultrafast confocal laser microscope equipped with a piezo-motor control unit. The volume of platelet thrombi formed after 8 min of blood perfusion in the presence of 10, 25, 50, and 100 micromol/L argatroban was 7.69+/-0.46 microm(3), 6.61+/-1.96 microm(3), 3.63+/-1.54 microm(3), and 1.67+/-0.75 microm(3), respectively. There was a positive correlation between the volume of platelet thrombi and the amount of fibrin monomer complex produced around them. The [Ca(2+)](i) of the platelets forming the thrombi oscillated between a minimum of 92.0+/-57.4 nmol/L, 120.1+/-68.1 nmol/L, and a maximum of 217.6+/-131.5 nmol/L, 367.6+/-189.1 nmol/L, respectively, in the presence of 100 and 10 mumol/L argatroban.\nThe results suggest a crucial role of coagulant activity in both the generation of fibrin and the growth of platelet thrombi.", "journal": "Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "date": "2009-01-31", "authors": ["NorikoTamura", "IsaoKitajima", "YotaKawamura", "EriToda", "YuEguchi", "HideyukiIshida", "ShinyaGoto"], "doi": "10.1253/circj.cj-08-0465"}
{"title": "Development of a piezo-actuated micro-teleoperation system for cell manipulation.", "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) requires long training and has low success rates, primarily due to poor control over the injection force. Making force feedback available to the operator will improve the success rate of the injection task. A macro-micro-teleoperation system bridges the gap between the task performed at the micro-level and the macroscopic movements of the operator. The teleoperation slave manipulator should accurately position a needle to precisely penetrate a cell membrane. Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in micromanipulation applications; however, hysteresis non-linearity limits the accuracy of these actuators.\nThis paper presents a novel approach for utilizing a piezoelectric nano-stage as slave manipulator of a teleoperation system. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model is used to model actuator hysteresis in a feedforward scheme to cancel out this non-linearity. To deal with the influence of parametric uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics and PI identification error, a perturbation term is added to the slave model and applies a sliding mode-based impedance control with perturbation estimation.\nThe stability of entire system is guaranteed by Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion.

{"title": "Use of a Piezo drill for intracytoplasmic sperm injection into cattle oocytes activated with ionomycin associated with roscovitine.", "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) consists of the introduction, by micromanipulation, of a single sperm into the cytoplasm of a mature egg. This technique is particularly advantageous when only a few sperm are available for fertilization, representing an important tool in preserving genetic material, especially from poorly fertile males. The results from ICSI in cattle are very often unsatisfactory and difficult to reproduce. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of a Piezo drill (PD) and oocyte activation with ionomycin + roscovitine (I + R) during ICSI in cattle oocytes. After in vitro maturation (24 h), cumulus complex oocytes were divided into four groups: G1 - the ICSI was performed without the use of a PD and the oocyte was activated with I + R; G2 - the ICSI was performed with the use of the PD and activation with I + R; G3 - the ICSI was performed with the use of the PD, but without activation and G4 - parthenogenetic control, treated with I + R, but without sperm injection. The presumptive zygotes were cultured for 7 days and evaluated on day 3 for cleavage rate and on day 7 for blastocyst formation. Embryo production by standard in vitro fertilization in the laboratory was 78% for cleavage (117/150) and 35% for blastocyst formation (41/150). The cleavage rates obtained in G1, G2 and G4 were similar (66.7%, 71.6% and 66.3%, respectively), demonstrating the beneficial effect of oocyte activation. However, in G3, despite the presence of the sperm and the electric stimulation of a PD, the cleavage rates were significantly lower (17.5%) compared with the groups that used chemical activation, even in the absence of sperm (G4). Despite the beneficial effects of activation, this stimulus alone, or in the absence of the PD, was not sufficient for adequate morulae formation (13.4%, 37.9%, 0.0% and 13.5% for G1, G2, G3 and G4, respectively). Only in G2, when the PD was used followed by artificial activation, blastocysts were obtained (14.7%).

{"title": "Edge technique for direct detection of strain and temperature based on optical time domain reflectometry.", "abstract": "A hybrid technique for real-time direct detection of strain and temperature along a single-mode fiber is proposed. The temperature is directly detected from the Raman backscattering in the time domain. To retrieve the strain profile from the Brillouin backscattering, an edge technique is introduced and a response function of the Fabry-Perot interferometer for the Brillouin backscattering is defined for the first time to our knowledge. The outgoing laser and the Brillouin backscattering are measured on different interference orders through different channels of the Fabry-Perot interferometer. A low-resolution reference channel and a high-resolution Brillouin channel are designed to keep both a high measurement sensitivity and a wide dynamic range. The measurement is based on detecting the bandwidth changes and the frequency shifts of the Brillouin backscattering; thus the resulting measurement is insensitive to the power fluctuation of the backscattering and the laser frequency jitter or drift. Neither time-consuming frequency scanning nor heavy data processing is needed, which makes real-time detection possible. The dynamic range of the edge technique can be increased substantially by using a piezoelectric tunable and capacitive-servo-stabilized Fabry-Perot interferometer. We highlight the potential of this technique by numerical simulations. Given that the uncertainty of the temperature measurement is 0.5 degrees C and that the spatial and temporal resolutions are 10 cm and 1 s, the strain uncertainty is less than 20 microepsilon within a 2 km distance when the strain is below 0.4%, and it is not more than 110 microepsilon within a 4 km distance when the strain is below 0.6%.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2009-01-13", "authors": ["HaiyunXia", "ChunxiZhang", "HongqianMu", "DongsongSun"], "doi": "10.1364/ao.48.000189"}

The material was found to have a clamped dielectric constant epsilon(33)(S)/epsilon(0)=890, piezoelectric coefficient d(33)=245 pC/N, electromechanical coupling factor k(t)=0.42 and Curie temperature T(c)>300 degrees C. High-frequency (40 MHz) ultrasound transducers were successfully fabricated with the lead-free material. A representative lead-free transducer had a bandwidth of 45%, two-way insertion loss of -18 dB. This performance is comparable to reported performances of popular lead-based transducers. The comparison results suggest that the lead-free piezoelectric material may serve as an alternative to lead-based piezoelectric materials for high-frequency ultrasonic transducer applications.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2009-01-06", "authors": ["D WWu", "R MChen", "Q FZhou", "K KShung", "D MLin", "H L WChan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2008.11.003"}
{"title": "Power generation with laterally packaged piezoelectric fine wires.", "abstract": "Converting mechanical energy into electricity could have applications in sensing, medical science, defence technology and personal electronics, and the ability of nanowires to 'scavenge' energy from ambient and environmental sources could prove useful for powering nanodevices. Previously reported nanowire generators were based on vertically aligned piezoelectric nanowires that were attached to a substrate at one end and free to move at the other. However, there were problems with the output stability, mechanical robustness, lifetime and environmental adaptability of such devices. Here we report a flexible power generator that is based on cyclic stretching-releasing of a piezoelectric fine wire that is firmly attached to metal electrodes at both ends, is packaged on a flexible substrate, and does not involve sliding contacts. Repeatedly stretching and releasing a single wire with a strain of 0.05-0.1% creates an oscillating output voltage of up to approximately 50 mV, and the energy conversion efficiency of the wire can be as high as 6.8%.", "journal": "Nature nanotechnology", "date": "2009-01-03", "authors": ["RusenYang", "YongQin", "LimingDai", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1038/nnano.2008.314"}

{"title": "Methods for Presenting Braille Characters on a Mobile Device with a Touchscreen and Tactile Feedback.", "abstract": "Three novel interaction methods were designed for reading six-dot Braille characters from the touchscreen of a mobile device. A prototype device with a piezoelectric actuator embedded under the touchscreen was used to create tactile feedback. The three interaction methods, scan, sweep, and rhythm, enabled users to read Braille characters one at a time either by exploring the characters dot by dot or by sensing a rhythmic pattern presented on the screen. The methods were tested with five blind Braille readers as a proof of concept. The results of the first experiment showed that all three methods can be used to convey information as the participants could accurately (91-97 percent) recognize individual characters. In the second experiment the presentation rate of the most efficient and preferred method, the rhythm, was varied. A mean recognition accuracy of 70 percent was found when the speed of presenting a single character was nearly doubled from the first experiment. The results showed that temporal tactile feedback and Braille coding can be used to transmit single-character information while further studies are still needed to evaluate the presentation of serial information, i.e., multiple Braille characters.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on haptics", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["JRantala", "RRaisamo", "JLylykangas", "VSurakka", "JRaisamo", "KSalminen", "TPakkanen", "AHippula"], "doi": "10.1109/TOH.2009.3"}

{"title": "Guided wave and damage detection in composite laminates using different fiber optic sensors.", "abstract": "Guided wave detection using different fiber optic sensors and their applications in damage detection for composite laminates were systematically investigated and compared in this paper. Two types of fiber optic sensors, namely fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) and Doppler effect-based fiber optic (FOD) sensors, were addressed and guided wave detection systems were constructed for both types. Guided waves generated by a piezoelectric transducer were propagated through a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate and acquired by these fiber optic sensors. Characteristics of these fiber optic sensors in ultrasonic guided wave detection were systematically compared. Results demonstrated that both the FBG and FOD sensors can be applied in guided wave and damage detection for the CFRP laminates. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of guided wave signal captured by an FOD sensor is relatively high in comparison with that of the FBG sensor because of their different physical principles in ultrasonic detection. Further, the FOD sensor is sensitive to the damage-induced fundamental shear horizontal (SH(0)) guided wave that, however, cannot be detected by using the FBG sensor, because the FOD sensor is omnidirectional in ultrasound detection and, in contrast, the FBG sensor is severely direction dependent.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["FucaiLi", "HideakiMurayama", "KazuroKageyama", "TakehiroShirai"], "doi": "10.3390/s90504005"}

{"title": "The measurement of biomechanical properties of porcine articular cartilage using atomic force microscopy.", "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that indentation-type atomic force microscopy (IT-AFM) is capable of detecting early onset osteoarthritis (OA) (Stolz, 2009). This study was based on biopsies, using a desk-top commercial atomic force microscope (AFM). However, cartilage analysis in the knee joints needs to be non-destructive to avoid new seeding points for OA by the taking of biopsies. This requires bringing the probe tip in contact with the articular cartilage (AC) surface inside the joint. Here we present our recent progress towards a medical instrument for performing such IT-AFM measurements for in-vivo knee diagnostics. The scanning force arthroscope (SFA) integrates a miniaturized AFM into a standard arthroscopic sleeve, and is used for direct, quantitative, in situ inspection of AC (Imer et al., 2006). The stabilization and the positioning of the instrument relative to the surface under investigation were performed by means of eight inflatable balloons. An integrated three-dimensional, piezoelectric scanner allowed raster scanning and probing of a small area of cartilage around the point of insertion. An AFM probe with an integrated deflection sensor was mounted at the distal end of the instrument. Using this instrument, several measurements were performed on agarose gel and on porcine cartilage samples. The load-displacement curves obtained were analyzed and the dynamic elastic moduli | E(*) | were calculated. A good correlation between these values and those published in the scientific literature was found.

Conventional AFM images of the same regions of the sample were also recorded before and after high-speed imaging. The ability of HS AFM to follow processes occurring in liquid on the timescale of a few seconds was employed to study the dissolution process of both hydroxyapatite and bovine enamel under acidic conditions. Buffered citric acid at pH values between 3.0 and 4.0 was observed to dissolve the surface layers of these samples. The movies recorded showed rapid dissolution of the bovine enamel in particular, which proceeded until the relatively small amount of acid available had been exhausted. A comparison was made with enamel samples that had been treated in fluoride solution (1 h in 300 ppm NaF, pH 7) prior to addition of the acid; the speed of dissolution for these samples was much less than that of the untreated samples.

The diameter of the hexagonal prism-shaped nanorods can be set in the range of 90-170 nm while their typical length achievable is 0.5-2.3 mum.

More recent developments in membrane functionalization have made the use of membrane science important in diverse fields, from tunable separations to catalysis. The focus of this work is to create a common membrane platform for the incorporation of technologies capable of degrading target pollutants. Functionalized membranes capable of metal capture were created using water-based and solvent-based acrylic acid polymerization to synthesize poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) within poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane pores. The COO(-) groups of PAA were used to capture Fe(II), which was then either reduced and doped with Pd to form Fe/Pd nanoparticles or used as-is for free radical generation with hydrogen peroxide. Fe/Pd nanoparticles were synthesized within the pores of a PAA/PVDF membrane functionalized via aqueous (green) chemistry and used to dechlorinate trichloroethylene (TCE) and 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl (DiCB). A PAA/PVDF membrane containing immobilized Fe(III) was used to obtain controlled free radical generation and target organic (pentachlorophenol) degradation within the membrane pore under convective flow conditions.", "journal": "Separation science and technology", "date": "2009-01-01", "authors": ["ScottLewis", "VasileSmuleac", "AlexMontague", "LeonidasBachas", "DibakarBhattacharyya"], "doi": "10.1080/01496390903212805"}

Forty-eight participants completed this study. Each participant had their body height and mass measured and completed a treadmill walking protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The treadmill walking protocol included six 5-minute stages starting at 1.5 mph and increasing by 0.5 mph, up to 4.0 mph while grade was constant at 0% for the duration of the test. The Kenz Life-Corder EX (LC), the Omron HJ-700IT (OM) and the Sportbrain iStep X1 (SB) were worn during the treadmill walking protocol. Heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and EE estimated from the motion sensors were monitored throughout the walking protocol. Results showed the OM overestimated net EE in normal, overweight and obese participants. The LC underestimated gross EE in all groups. The SB overestimated net EE in normal BMI participants, was not significantly different from the criterion measure of net EE in overweight participants and underestimated net EE in obese individuals.

The nanostripes run almost in parallel to the nanobelt direction but at an offset angle of approximately 5 degrees . We have measured the transport properties of a nanohelix and found its abnormal nonlinear characteristic. In comparison to the Ohmic transport property of a single crystal ZnO nanobelt measured under the same experimental conditions, the symmetric \"Schottky-type\" I-V property of the nanohelix is suggested due to nanostripe boundaries and surfaces, where built-in periodic back-to-back energy barriers might occur across the nanostripe interfaces as a result of polar charges and interface-strain-induced piezoelectric effect. The effective potential barrier across the nanostripe boundary is estimated to be approximately 24 meV. With the increasing of bias voltage, electrons can effectively tunnel through and thermionic emission across nanostripe boundaries, leading to a fast increase in transport current.

An acoustic standing wave, perpendicular to the fluid flow, is generated by the excitation of a miniaturized piezoelectric transducer operated around 10 MHz. The transducer is fabricated into a planar printed circuit board structure, constituting the bottom channel wall, which makes the mixer simple to integrate with a wide selection of microfluidic channel designs. The mixing occurs at a fluid-fluid density interface due to the acoustic radiation force; an analytical expression is derived to qualitatively describe this phenomenon. Only a small density difference in the range of 2-5% is required to achieve 150-270% peak broadening of a fluorescent sample between sheath flows, which we use as a measure of the mixing efficiency. The mixing efficiency is measured with regard to its sensitivity to the density difference, the fluid velocity and the transducer driving frequency. Transducers at different positions along the microchannel make it possible to compare the mixing of straight versus diagonal flows across the transducer surface.

Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between oocyte morphology and both embryo development and pregnancy outcome. In the present study, we compared the morphology of oocytes with subsequent development of human somatic cell NT (SCNT) embryos.\nPiezo-assisted SCNT technology was used to produce reconstructed embryos, with almost 92% of oocytes reconstructed successfully. Depending on their morphologies, we separated metaphase II oocytes into four grades according to criteria which assess oocyte morphology, first polar body and perivitelline space, and especially, cytoplasm granula distribution.\nEmbryos from oocytes of Grades A and B could develop to the blastocyst stage with similar development efficiency for every developmental stage. However, embryos from Grade C oocytes arrested at or before the 8-cell stage then degraded, and the donor cell genome could not be activated and reprogrammed in such oocytes. For Grade D oocytes, cleavage was not observed in the reconstructed embryos, suggesting that the oocytes themselves have no developmental potential.\nOur study revealed that different levels of developmental competence of SCNT embryos resulting from different oocyte reprogramming potentials associated with different morphologies.

Currently, there are no experimental investigations on the ballistic background of these devices.\nAn experimental test set-up was designed for measurement of the firing pressure and the dynamic force of the gas jet of a vole captive bolt device. Therefore, a vole captive bolt device was prepared with a pressure take-off channel and a piezoelectric transducer for measurement of the firing pressure. For measurement of the dynamic impact force of the gas jet an annular quartz force sensor was installed on a test bench. Each three simultaneous measurements of the cartridges' firing pressure and the dynamic force of the blast wave were taken at various distances between muzzle and load washer.\nThe maximum gas pressure in the explosion chamber was up to 1100 bar.

The maximum impact force of the gas jet at the target showed a strong inverse ratio to the muzzle's distance and was up to 11,500 N for the contact shot distance. Energy density of the gas jet for the close contact shot was far beyond the energy density required for skin penetration.\nThe unique design features (short tube between cartridge mouth and muzzle and narrow diameter of the muzzle) of these gadgets are responsible for the high firing pressure, velocity and force of the gas jet.

Both of these polymeric compounds are major components of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and are impacting membrane fouling; however most of the data so far have been collected by determining sum parameters rather than the detailed composition of these polymers. Photometric analysis of sugars showed that uronic acids (glucuronic, mannuronic and galacturonic acid) as common units of bacterial polysaccharides accounted for 8% (w/w) of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge flocs. Further the so-called polysaccharide peak of EPS, with a molecular weight >10 kDa according to size exclusion chromatography, was proven to contain bacterial sugar units as shown by high resolution LC-MS. Interestingly, only traces of uronic acids could be detected in EPS of the membrane fouling layer. A far more dramatic enrichment in the fouling layer was revealed for the lipid fraction of EPS, which was determined as fatty acid methyl esters by GC-MS. The weight percentage of fatty acids in EPS extracted from fouled ultrafiltration membranes was much higher (10%) than in the activated sludge itself (1-3%). The fatty acids accumulated on the membrane fouling layer were obviously not only of microbial origin (C16:0, C18:0) but also derived from the raw wastewater itself (C9:0). Hydrophobic interaction of lipids with the PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane material therefore seems a plausible explanation for the observed fouling phenomenon.

{"title": "Single-transducer dual-frequency ultrasound generation to enhance acoustic cavitation.", "abstract": "Dual- or multiple-frequency ultrasound stimulation is capable of effectively enhancing the acoustic cavitation effect over single-frequency ultrasound. Potential application of this sonoreactor design has been widely proposed such as on sonoluminescence, sonochemistry enhancement, and transdermal drug release enhancement. All currently available sonoreactor designs employed multiple piezoelectric transducers for generating single-frequency ultrasonic waves separately and then these waves were mixed and interfered in solutions. The purpose of this research is to propose a novel design of generating dual-frequency ultrasonic waves with single piezoelectric elements, thereby enhancing acoustic cavitation. Macroscopic bubbles were detected optically, and they were quantified at either a single-frequency or for different frequency combinations for determining their efficiency for enhancing acoustic cavitation. Visible bubbles were optically detected and hydrogen peroxide was measured to quantify acoustic cavitation. Test water samples with different gas concentrations and different power levels were used to determine the efficacy of enhancing acoustic cavitation of this design. The spectrum obtained from the backscattered signals was also recorded and examined to confirm the occurrence of stable cavitation. The results confirmed that single-element dual-frequency ultrasound stimulation can enhance acoustic cavitation. Under certain testing conditions, the generation of bubbles can be enhanced up to a level of five times higher than the generation of bubbles in single-frequency stimulation, and can increase the hydrogen peroxide production up to an increase of one fold.

The flow rate generated by the peristaltic micropumps used in such applications depends on the actuation sequence. Accordingly, the current study performs an analytical and experimental investigation to determine the correlation between the dynamic response of the diaphragms in the micropump and the actuation sequence. A simple analytical model of a peristaltic micropump is established to analyze the shift in the resonant frequency of the diaphragms caused by the viscous damping effect. The analytical results show that this damping effect increases as the oscillation frequency of the diaphragm increases. A peristaltic micropump with three piezoelectric actuators is fabricated on a silicon substrate and is actuated using 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-phase actuation sequences via a driving system comprising a microprocessor and a phase controller. A series of experiments is conducted using de-ionized water as the working fluid to determine the diaphragm displacement and the flow rates induced by each of the different actuation sequences under phase frequencies ranging from 50 Hz to 1 MHz. The results show that the damping effect of actuation sequences influences diaphragm resonant frequency, which in turn affects the profiles of flow rates.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2008-09-30", "authors": ["Ling-ShengJang", "KuanShu", "Yung-ChiangYu", "Yuan-JieLi", "Chiun-HsunChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-008-9222-3"}

We succeeded in producing medaka individuals by ICSI with a rate of 13.4% (28 hatched embryos out of 209 eggs fertilized by ICSI), the best value reported so far in teleosts, including zebrafish and Nile tilapia. Although the technique was based on that developed for mammalian eggs, some critical modifications were made to adjust it to the medaka egg, which has a thick and hard envelope (the chorion) and a single sperm entry site (the micropyle). Medaka ICSI was performed by injecting a demembranated spermatozoon into an egg cytoplasm through the micropyle 10-15 sec after egg activation induced by a piezo-actuated vibration, the site and timing of sperm penetration being consistent with those in normal fertilization in medaka. To increase the efficiency of ICSI in medaka, we found that the fertilization by ICSI should precisely mimic the fertilization by insemination with intact sperm, both spatially and temporally. The success rate of ICSI was highly variable in batches of eggs (ranging from 0% to 56%), suggesting that the conditions of eggs are important factors in stabilizing the production of individuals by ICSI. The success in medaka ICSI provides a basis for future research to understand the basic mechanisms in gamete biology of teleosts as well as for development of new technology that can yield valuable applications in fisheries science.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2008-09-05", "authors": ["SatoshiOtani", "ToshiharuIwai", "ShingoNakahata", "ChiharuSakai", "MasakaneYamashita"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.108.069880"}

FTIR revealed the piezoelectric inkjet technology technique to be nondestructive. Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the extent of chelation caused by Fe(III). The adhesive strength in these materials was correlated with the extent of chelation by Fe(III).

{"title": "Functional assessment of centrosomes of spermatozoa and spermatids microinjected into rabbit oocytes.", "abstract": "Although intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a widely used assisted reproductive technique, the fertilization rates and pregnancy rates of immature spermatids especially in round spermatid injection (ROSI) remain very low. During mammalian fertilization, the sperm typically introduces its own centrosome which then acts as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and is essential for the male and female genome union. In order to evaluate the function of immature germ cell centrosomes, we used the rabbit gamete model because rabbit fertilization follows paternal pattern of centrosome inheritance. First, rabbit spermatids and spermatozoa were injected into oocytes using a piezo-micromanipulator. Next, the centrosomal function to form a sperm aster was determined. Furthermore, two functional centrosome proteins (gamma-tubulin and centrin) of the rabbit spermatogenic cells were examined. Our results show that the oocyte activation rates by spermatozoa, elongated spermatids, and round spermatids were 86% (30/35), 30% (11/36), and 5% (1/22), respectively. Sperm aster formation rates after spermatozoa, elongated spermatids, and round spermatids injections were 47% (14/30), 27% (3/11), and 0% (0/1), respectively. The aster formation rate of the injected elongating/elongated spermatids was significantly lower than that of the mature spermatozoa (P = 0.0242). Moreover, sperm asters were not observed in round spermatid injection even after artificial activation. These data suggest that poor centrosomal function, as measured by diminished aster formation rates, is related to the poor fertilization rates when immature spermatogenic cells are injected.", "journal": "Molecular reproduction and development", "date": "2008-07-23", "authors": ["MasahitoTachibana", "YukihiroTerada", "NarumiOgonuki", "TomohisaUgajin", "AtsuoOgura", "TakashiMurakami", "NobuoYaegashi", "KunihiroOkamura"], "doi": "10.1002/mrd.20951"}

As first experiments this technique was applied to some test solutions of saccharose in water, ethanol in water and of both solvents in water, in order to evaluate the method applicability and resolution. Best results are obtained by the propagation velocity measurement, with a resolution less than 2%. The method was then applied to monitor the wine fermentation: the propagation velocity in the must was measured every day and the results were related to chemical analyses.

The wave field emitted by an AFC surface bonded on an isotropic plate was simulated with the finite-difference method. The model includes the piezoelectric element and the plate and allows the simulation of the elastic wave propagation. For comparison with the model experiments using a laser interferometer for non-contact measurements of particle velocities at different points around the AFC on the surface of the plate were performed. Transfer functions defined as the ratio of the electric voltage excitation signal and the resulting surface velocity at a specific point are separately determined for the two fundamental Lamb wave modes. In order to take the orthotropic behavior of the AFC into account the transfer functions are determined for several points around the AFC. Results show that the AFC is capable to excite the fundamental symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb wave mode.

Coating reduced platelet consumption of PET fabric by 50%. Upon surface modification leukocyte consumption of PET was reduced by 24%. About 60% reduction in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) observed when PET was coated with PVDF. Results of endothelial cell proliferation studies showed that surface coating did not have any substantial impact on cell proliferation. Overall results indicate that coating has potential to improve haemocompatibility of PET fabric without affecting its mechanical performance.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

Visceral adhesions and shrinkage of prosthetics may complicate repairs. The aim of this study was to compare adhesion formation, mesh shrinkage and tissue ingrowth after intra-abdominal placement of a novel two-component monofilament mesh structure made of polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) with current alternatives.\nForty Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Mesh samples were fixed as intra-abdominal only mesh at the right lateral abdominal wall. The study groups were: PVDF+PP (polypropylene parietally and polyvinylidenfluoride viscerally), PP+Col (polypropylene with a collagenoxidized film), ePTFE (smooth surface viscerally and a textured surface parietally), and PP (a pure polypropylene mesh serving as control). The meshes were explanted after 30 days. Adhesions were scored as a percentage of explanted biomaterials' affected surface area; prosthetic shrinkage was calculated. Foreign-body reaction to mesh materials was measured by investigating the amount of inflammatory infiltrate and fibrotic tissue formation.\nIn terms of adhesion score, the pure PP mesh showed the highest values followed by the ePTFE, PVDF+PP, and PP+Col meshes. Quantitative assessment of adhesion area revealed a significantly higher value of the pure PP mesh sample (62.0 +/- 22.1%) compared with the PP+Col (26.8 +/- 12.1%) and the PVDF+PP mesh (34.6 +/- 8.2%). Percentage of shrinkage showed a significantly higher value of the ePTFE mesh (52.4 +/- 13.9%) compared with all other mesh modifications (PP+Col 19.8 +/- 13.9%, PVDF+PP 19.9 +/- 7.0%, and PP 26.8 +/- 9.5%). Inflammatory infiltrate was significantly reduced in the PVDF+PP mesh group compared with all other mesh samples.\nThe use of the novel two-component monofilament mesh structure made of polypropylene and polyvinylidenfluoride was found to be favorable regarding adhesion formation and mesh shrinkage compared to conventional mesh materials used for intra-abdominal placement.", "journal": "Surgical endoscopy", "date": "2008-04-26", "authors": ["KarstenJunge", "MarcelBinneb\u00f6sel", "RaphaelRosch", "MarcJansen", "DanielK\u00e4mmer", "JensOtto", "VolkerSchumpelick", "UweKlinge"], "doi": "10.1007/s00464-008-9923-y"}
{"title": "Proteomic scale high-sensitivity analyses of GPI membrane anchors.", "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells. Earlier analysis methods required large amounts of purified protein to elucidate the structure of the GPI. This paper describes methods for analyzing GPIs on a 'proteomic' scale. Partially purified proteins may be run on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Following identification of the protein the piece of PVDF may be subjected to various chemical treatments, which are specific for GPI structures. The first method uses gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and it enables the presence of a GPI anchor to be confirmed. The second method depends on the cleavage of phosphate bonds and permits the carbohydrate structure to be elucidated by electrospray or matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The final method described uses deamination of the glucosamine residue to release the lipid moiety for analysis by mass spectrometry.", "journal": "Glycoconjugate journal", "date": "2008-03-12", "authors": ["AngelaMehlert", "Michael A JFerguson"], "doi": "10.1007/s10719-008-9116-x\n10.1016/S0076-6879(05)05008-1\n10.1126/science.3340856\n10.1093/glycob/cwg004\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.11.001\n10.1006/jmbi.1997.1600\n10.1016/S0166-6851(00)00386-8\n10.1074/jbc.M306835200\n10.1074/jbc.M208942200"}
{"title": "Thin film piezoelectric response characterisation using atomic force microscopy with standard contact mode imaging.", "abstract": "This article introduces a technique for observing and quantifying the piezoelectric response of thin films, using standard atomic force microscopes (AFMs). The technique has been developed and verified using strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate (PSZT) thin films, which are known for their high piezoelectric response. Quantification of the electro-mechanical voltage coefficient d(33) (pm/V) is made directly based on the applied peak-to-peak voltage and the corresponding peak-to-peak displacement in the obtained scan image. Under the proposed technique the AFM is configured in contact mode, where the silicon nitride tip is set to follow the film displacement at a single point. A known sinusoidal voltage is applied across the film and the displacement determined as a function of time, rather than the typical AFM measurement of displacement versus tip position. The resulting raster image contains several bands, which are directly related to the AFM scan frequency and the applied sinusoidal voltage and its frequency. Different combinations of the AFM scan frequency and the applied sinusoid frequency have been used to characterise the PSZT thin films, with estimated values of d(33) between 109 and 205 pm/V.", "journal": "Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)", "date": "2008-02-26", "authors": ["SSriram", "MBhaskaran", "K TShort", "G IMatthews", "A SHolland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micron.2008.01.007"}
{"title": "Influence of oxygen partial pressure on the composition and orientation of strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate thin films.", "abstract": "The influence of oxygen partial pressure during the deposition of piezoelectric strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate thin films is reported. The thin films have been deposited by RF magnetron sputtering in an atmosphere of high purity argon and oxygen (in the ratio of 9:1), on platinum-coated silicon substrates (heated to 650 degrees C). The influence of oxygen partial pressure is studied to understand the manner in which the stoichiometry of the thin films is modified, and to understand the influence of stoichiometry on the perovskite orientation. This article reports on the results obtained from films deposited at oxygen partial pressures of 1-5 mTorr. The thin films have been studied using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GA-XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). XPS analysis highlights the marked influence of variations in oxygen pressure during sputtering, observed by variations in oxygen concentration in the thin films, and in some cases by the undesirable decrease in lead concentration in the thin films. GA-XRD is used to study the relative variations in perovskite peak intensities, and has been used to determine the deposition conditions to attain the optimal combination of stoichiometry and orientation. AFM scans show the marked influence of the oxygen partial pressure on the film morphology.", "journal": "Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)", "date": "2008-02-16", "authors": ["SSriram", "MBhaskaran", "Jdu Plessis", "K TShort", "V PSivan", "A SHolland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micron.2007.12.009"}
