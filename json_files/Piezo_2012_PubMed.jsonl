{"title": "Piezosurgery-assisted, flapless split crest surgery for implant site preparation.", "abstract": "Bucco-lingual resorption of the alveolar ridge can, at times, be predictably corrected at the time of implant placement. Among the different options available to achieve this are a group of surgical techniques described as split crest or split ridge procedures. Most of these procedures require the use of a mallet and some type of chisels and/or osteotomes; they are very technique-sensitive and can be uncomfortable for patients. Recently, alternative tools to split the crest have been presented, and these include the newer bone expanders and the piezoelectric scalpel. A flapless approach to implant dentistry has become popular with the aim to alleviate post treatment side effects, accelerate healing and avoid bone resorption caused by flap elevation.\nWe present a technique combining the use of a piezoelectric scalpel and a tapered bone expander in a flapless fashion as a novel way to perform split crest procedures with an aim to optimize outcomes and acceptability by patients.\nAll implants were successfully placed and the resorbed ridge expanded in the same setting. Findings were confirmed by postoperative cone beam cat scan (CBCT) evaluation.\nThis new technique is a predictable approach for split crest procedures and has high acceptability by patients and is technically simple for surgeons.", "journal": "Journal of maxillofacial and oral surgery", "date": "2014-03-20", "authors": ["FedericoBrugnami", "AlfonsoCaiazzo", "PushkarMehra"], "doi": "10.1007/s12663-012-0377-3\n10.1902/jop.1988.59.5.287\n10.1016/S0300-9785(81)80077-4\n10.1016/S0901-5027(05)80262-0\n10.1097/00008505-200009020-00011\n10.1902/jop.2007.060285\n10.1016/j.joms.2009.04.041\n10.1111/j.1708-8208.2003.tb00013.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2006.01357.x"}

Previously, we showed that Hansenula polymorpha Pex14p was phosphorylated in vivo. In this study, we identified its phosphorylation site by mass spectrometry. Recombinant His-tagged Pex14p (H6-Pex14p) was overexpressed and purified from the yeast. The protein band corresponding to H6-Pex14p was in-gel digested with trypsin and subjected to LC/MS. As a result of LC/MS, Thr(248) and Ser(258) were identified as the phosphorylated sites. To confirm the phosphorylation sites and explore its functions, we made Ala mutants of the candidate amino acids. In the western blot analysis with anti-Pex14p, S258A mutant gave doublet bands while wild type (WT) and T248A mutants gave triplet bands. Moreover, the double mutant (T248A/S258A) gave a single band.

The immunosensor showed a detection limit of 13.0 nmol L(-1) with excellent specificity, showing no response for different proteins that include another cysteine peptidase that is used as a target to detect Xylella fastidiosa bacterium, responsible for another important citrus disease.

This hybrid energy harvester consists of the unimorph piezoelectric cantilever and a couple of permanent magnets.

The mechanical energy provided through the human walking motion, which is a typical ubiquitous presence of vibration, is converted to the electric energy via the piezoelectric cantilever vibration system. At first, we studied the energy convert mechanism and the performance of our energy harvester, where the resonance free vibration of unimorph cantilever with one permanent magnet under a rather high frequency was induced by the artificial low frequency vibration. The counterpart magnet attached on the pendulum. Next, we equipped the counterpart permanent magnet pendulum, which was fluctuated under a very low frequency by the human walking, and the piezoelectric cantilever, which had the permanent magnet at the end.

The robot performs actuated needle MRI-guidance with the goals of providing (i) MRI compatibility, (ii) MRI-guided needle placement with accuracy sufficient for targeting clinically significant prostate cancer foci, (iii) reducing interventional procedure times (thus increasing patient comfort and reducing opportunity for needle targeting error due to patient motion), (iv) enabling real-time MRI monitoring of interventional procedures, and (v) reducing the opportunities for error that arise in manually actuated needle placement. The design of the robot, employing piezo-ceramic-motor actuated needle guide positioning and manual needle insertion, is reported. Results of a MRI compatibility study show no reduction of MRI signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) with the motors disabled. Enabling the motors reduces the SNR by 80% without RF shielding, but SNR is only reduced by 40% to 60% with RF shielding. The addition of radio-frequency shielding is shown to significantly reduce image SNR degradation caused by the presence of the robotic device. An accuracy study of MRI-guided biopsy needle placements in a prostate phantom is reported. The study shows an average in-plane targeting error of 2.4 mm with a maximum error of 3.7 mm.

{"title": "Echo particle image velocimetry.", "abstract": "The transport of mass, momentum, and energy in fluid flows is ultimately determined by spatiotemporal distributions of the fluid velocity field.(1) Consequently, a prerequisite for understanding, predicting, and controlling fluid flows is the capability to measure the velocity field with adequate spatial and temporal resolution.(2) For velocity measurements in optically opaque fluids or through optically opaque geometries, echo particle image velocimetry (EPIV) is an attractive diagnostic technique to generate \"instantaneous\" two-dimensional fields of velocity.(3,4,5,6) In this paper, the operating protocol for an EPIV system built by integrating a commercial medical ultrasound machine(7) with a PC running commercial particle image velocimetry (PIV) software(8) is described, and validation measurements in Hagen-Poiseuille (i.e., laminar pipe) flow are reported. For the EPIV measurements, a phased array probe connected to the medical ultrasound machine is used to generate a two-dimensional ultrasound image by pulsing the piezoelectric probe elements at different times. Each probe element transmits an ultrasound pulse into the fluid, and tracer particles in the fluid (either naturally occurring or seeded) reflect ultrasound echoes back to the probe where they are recorded. The amplitude of the reflected ultrasound waves and their time delay relative to transmission are used to create what is known as B-mode (brightness mode) two-dimensional ultrasound images. Specifically, the time delay is used to determine the position of the scatterer in the fluid and the amplitude is used to assign intensity to the scatterer. The time required to obtain a single B-mode image, t, is determined by the time it take to pulse all the elements of the phased array probe. For acquiring multiple B-mode images, the frame rate of the system in frames per second (fps) = 1/\u03b4t. (See 9 for a review of ultrasound imaging.) For a typical EPIV experiment, the frame rate is between 20-60 fps, depending on flow conditions, and 100-1000 B-mode images of the spatial distribution of the tracer particles in the flow are acquired. Once acquired, the B-mode ultrasound images are transmitted via an ethernet connection to the PC running the PIV commercial software. Using the PIV software, tracer particle displacement fields, D(x,y)[pixels], (where x and y denote horizontal and vertical spatial position in the ultrasound image, respectively) are acquired by applying cross correlation algorithms to successive ultrasound B-mode images.(10) The velocity fields, u(x,y)[m/s], are determined from the displacements fields, knowing the time step between image pairs, \u0394T[s], and the image magnification, M[meter/pixel], i.e., u(x,y) = MD(x,y)/\u0394T. The time step between images \u0394T = 1/fps + D(x,y)/B, where B[pixels/s] is the time it takes for the ultrasound probe to sweep across the image width. In the present study, M = 77[\u03bcm/pixel], fps = 49.5[1/s], and B = 25,047[pixels/s]. Once acquired, the velocity fields can be analyzed to compute flow quantities of interest.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2013-01-10", "authors": ["NicholasDeMarchi", "ChristopherWhite"], "doi": "10.3791/4265"}

To induce the piezoelectric \u03b2-phase crystal structure, the nanocomposite films were drawn in a ratio of 4\u20135 and polarized by a step-wise poling method. To evaluate the piezoelectric property, the output voltages of the rGO\u2013PVDF nanocomposite films were measured through extensive experimental vibration tests. The experimental results show that the rGO\u2013PVDF nanocomposite film with 0.05 wt% rGO loading possesses the highest output voltage compared with other loadings, which is around 293% of that of the pure PVDF film. Moreover, it can be found that with the increase of the rGO content from 0 wt% to 0.2 wt%, the output voltage tends to have a peak at 0.05 wt%. The main reason for this phenomenon is that a more \u03b2-crystalline phase can be formed at those rGO loadings, as confirmed by XRD and FT-IR spectrum analyses.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2013-01-03", "authors": ["NoneAlamusi", "JunMinXue", "LiangKeWu", "NingHu", "JianhuiQiu", "ChristianaChang", "SatoshiAtobe", "HisaoFukunaga", "TomonoriWatanabe", "YaoLuLiu", "HuiMingNing", "JinHuaLi", "YuanLi", "YinghuaZhao"], "doi": "10.1039/c2nr32185h"}
{"title": "A macroscopic non-destructive testing system based on the cantilever-sample contact resonance.", "abstract": "Detecting the inside or buried defects in materials and structures is always a challenge in the field of nondestructive testing (NDT). In this paper, enlightened by the operation principle of the contact resonance force microscopy or atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM), we proposed a macroscopic NDT system based on contact resonance of the cantilever-sample surface to detect the local stiffness variations in materials or structures. We fabricated a piezoelectric unimorph with the dimension typically of 150 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 2 mm to act as a macroscopic cantilever, whose flexural mode vibration was driven by a wideband power amplifier together with a signal generator. The vibration signal of the macroscopic cantilever is detected by a high sensitive strain gauge bonded on the cantilever surface which is much more stable than the laser diode sensor in AFAM, thus making it very suitable for outdoor operations. Scanning is realized by a three-dimensional motorized stage with the Z axis for pressing force setting. The whole system is controlled by a LabVIEW-based homemade software. Like the AFAM, this NDT system can also work in two modes, i.e., the single-frequency mode and the resonance-tracking mode. In the latter mode, the contact stiffness at each pixel of the sample can be obtained by using the measured contact resonance frequency and a beam dynamics model. Testing results of this NDT system on a grid structure with an opaque panel show that in both modes the prefabricated defect beneath the panel can be detected and the grid structures can be clearly \"seen,\" which indicates the validity of this NDT system. The sensitivity of this NDT system was also examined.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2013-01-03", "authors": ["JiFu", "LizhiLin", "XilongZhou", "YingweiLi", "FaxinLi"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4770123"}

From the results we can find that the effects of the liquid viscosity on the properties of SH-SAW are remarkable. The phase velocity decreases with increase of the viscous coefficient, or with increase of the frequency, and the attenuation increases with the frequency of the waves and the liquid viscosity, respectively. The relationship between attenuation and frequency or viscosity is nonlinear, but the former is a concave curve, whereas the latter is a convex curve.

Our results exhibit interesting behavior. (i) AlN and GaN share the same structural transition from wurtzite to a graphite-like phase at very large compressive strains, similarly to other wurtzite semiconductors. Our calculations further reveal that this well-known phase transition is driven by the transverse-acoustic soft phonon mode associated with elastic instabilities.

Furthermore, large enhancements of polarization and piezoelectricity close to the phase-transition regions at large compressive strains are predicted, similar to those previously predicted in ferroelectric fields. Our calculations indicate that such colossal enhancements are strongly correlated to phase transitions when large atomic displacements are generated by external strains.

{"title": "Influence of the middle ear anatomy on the performance of a membrane sensor in the incudostapedial joint gap.", "abstract": "There is a great demand for implantable microphones for future generations of implantable hearing aids, especially Cochlea Implants. An implantable middle ear microphone based on a piezoelectric membrane sensor for insertion into the incudostapedial gap is investigated. The sensor is designed to measure the sound-induced forces acting on the center of the membrane. The sensor mechanically couples to the adjacent ossicles via two contact areas, the sensor membrane and the sensor housing. The sensing element is a piezoelectric single crystal bonded on a titanium membrane. The sensor allows a minimally invasive and reversible implantation without removal of ossicles and without additional sensor fixation in the tympanic cavity. This study investigates the implantable microphone sensor and its implantation concept. It intends to quantify the influence of the sensor's insertion position on the achievable microphone sensitivity. The investigation considers anatomical and pathological variations of the middle ear geometry and its space limitations. Temporal bone experiments on a laboratory model show that anatomical and pathological variations of the middle ear geometry can prevent the sensor from being placed optimally within the incudostapedial joint. Beyond scattering of transfer functions due to anatomic variations of individual middle ears there is the impact of variations in the sensor position within the ossicular chain that has a considerable effect on the transfer characteristics of the middle ear microphone. The centering of the sensor between incus and stapes, the direction of insertion (membrane to stapes or to incus) and the effect of additional contact points with surrounding anatomic structures affect the signal yield of the implanted sensor. The presence of additional contact points has a considerably impact on the sensitivity, yet the microphone sensitivity is quite robust against small changes in the positioning of the incus on the sensor. Signal losses can be avoided by adjusting the position of the sensor within the joint. The findings allow the development of an improved surgical insertion technique to ensure maximally achievable signal yield of the membrane sensor in the ISJ and provides valuable knowledge for a future design considerations including sensor miniaturization and geometry.

The protein profiles of the 2-DE gels were compared with the hybridization results on a global level.

The sensing surface was designed with rabbit antibovine IgG as the detecting molecule, coupled onto a carboxymethyl dextran-coated gold crystal. Total binding and non-specific binding were measured using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Conditions of analysis, including ligand immobilization, dilution ratio of milk, salinity, and pH of the dilution buffer were optimized by Doehlert experimental design in order to enhance the detection specificity. The performances of the optimized immunosensor were evaluated. The standard curve was established from QCM-D responses and was linear until an IgG concentration of 2500 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 46 ng/mL.

GABA(B) receptor R2 subunit (GABA(B)R2) is phosphorylated at S783 by 5'-AMP-activated-protein kinase (AMPK), and this phosphorylation modulates GABA(B) receptor desensitization. Since the GABA(B) receptor is an integral membrane protein, solubilizing GABA(B)R2 is difficult. To circumvent this problem and to identify specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate S783, we employed an in vitro assay based on dephosphorylation of proteins on PVDF membranes by purified phosphatases. Our method allowed us to demonstrate that S783 in GABA(B)R2 is directly dephosphorylated by PP2A (but not by PP1, PP2B nor PP2C) in a dose-dependent and okadaic acid-sensitive manner. We also show that the level of phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of AMPK at T172 is reduced by PP1, PP2A and PP2C.

To effectively remove these substances and minimize fouling during ultrafiltration, an electro-ultrafiltration process was used to separate benzophenone-3 (BP-3) from water by applying an electric field across the membrane. The effects of the electric field on the filtration performance, including resistance and retention, modification of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and possible intermediates produced during electro-ultrafiltration, were studied thoroughly. The results clearly indicate that the combination of the electric field with ultrafiltration could increase BP-3 rejection and reduce filtration resistance. The membrane had a rougher surface and the pore size increased due to the modifications of PVDF membrane induced by the electric field. The decrease in contact angle demonstrated the improvement of hydrophilicity in the PVDF membrane surface after the electrofiltration treatment. The mechanism of BP-3 degradation in the electrofiltration was examined theoretically by calculating the frontier electron densities of the BP-3 molecule.

Water condensates, resulting from the use of humidifiers, but also residual nebulization particles may have a major influence on expiratory limb resistance.\nTo evaluate the influence of nebulization and active humidification on the resistance of expiratory filters.\nA respiratory system analog was constructed using a test lung, an ICU ventilator, heated humidifiers, and a piezoelectric nebulizer. Humidifiers were connected to different types of circuits (unheated, mono-heated, new-generation and old-generation bi-heated). Five filter types were evaluated: electrostatic, heat-and-moisture exchanger, standard, specific, and internal heated high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filter. Baseline characteristics were obtained from each dry filter. Differential pressure measurements were carried out after 24 hours of continuous in vitro use for each condition, and after 24 hours of use with an old-generation bi-heated circuit without nebulization.\nWhile using unheated circuits, measurements had to be interrupted before 24 hours for all the filtering devices except the internal heated HEPA filter. The heat-and-moisture exchangers occluded before 24 hours with the unheated and mono-heated circuits. The circuit type, nebulization practice, and duration of use did not influence the internal heated HEPA filter resistance.\nExpiratory limb filtration is likely to induce several major adverse events. Expiratory filter resistance increase is due mainly to the humidification circuit type, rather than to nebulization.

{"title": "Drosophila NOMPC is a mechanotransduction channel subunit for gentle-touch sensation.", "abstract": "Touch sensation is essential for behaviours ranging from environmental exploration to social interaction; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In Drosophila larvae, two types of sensory neurons, class III and class IV dendritic arborization neurons, tile the body wall. The mechanotransduction channel PIEZO in class IV neurons is essential for sensing noxious mechanical stimuli but is not involved in gentle touch. On the basis of electrophysiological-recording, calcium-imaging and behavioural studies, here we report that class III dendritic arborization neurons are touch sensitive and contribute to gentle-touch sensation. We further identify NOMPC (No mechanoreceptor potential C), a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, as a mechanotransduction channel for gentle touch. NOMPC is highly expressed in class III neurons and is required for their mechanotransduction. Moreover, ectopic NOMPC expression confers touch sensitivity to the normally touch-insensitive class IV neurons. In addition to the critical role of NOMPC in eliciting gentle-touch-mediated behavioural responses, expression of this protein in the Drosophila S2 cell line also gives rise to mechanosensitive channels in which ion selectivity can be altered by NOMPC mutation, indicating that NOMPC is a pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel. Our study establishes NOMPC as a bona fide mechanotransduction channel that satisfies all four criteria proposed for a channel to qualify as a transducer of mechanical stimuli and mediates gentle-touch sensation.

A distinct feature of domain dynamics is roughening of the domains walls during switching to the preferred polarization state as opposed to smooth domain boundaries during switching to the opposite direction. The observed switching behavior is explained by a combined effect of the spatially uniform built-in electric field and local disorder potential.

Material property characterization for these thick-film PZT resonators is essential for device design and applications. For the property characterization, a recently developed normalized electrical impedance spectrum method was used to determine the electromechanical coefficient and the complex piezoelectric, elastic, and dielectric coefficients from the electrical measurement of resonators using thick films.

Narrow frequency range and broad frequency range vibration isolation systems are analyzed, modeled, and experimentally investigated.

In micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications, it is preferable to use structures consisting of a passive substrate (usually silicon) and one or more piezoelectric layers on the top. Such structures are called heterogeneous bimorphs or enakemesomorphs. In some MEMS applications- for example, for use as acoustic transducers-it is desirable to arrange such heterogeneous bimorphs in a circular shape, which results in trapezoidal cantilever structures. In this paper, an analytic dynamic description of such actuators is obtained. The resulting model is proved to be compatible with existing models for heterogeneous bimorphs with constant width. A comparison to a finite element analysis model of an exemplary layout shows divergences wholly within the same range as found for published models for constant-width structures.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["JonathanSchachtele", "ErichGoll", "PaulMuralt", "DominikKaltenbacher"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2518"}

First, the dynamic model of the PFNS is derived in detail. Then, to achieve robust, accurate trajectory-tracking performance, a nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (NTSMC) system is proposed for the tracking of the reference contours. The steady-state response of the control system can be improved effectively because of the addition of the nonsingularity in the NTSMC. Moreover, to relax the requirements of the bounds and discard the switching function in NTSMC, an INTSMC system using a multi-input-multioutput (MIMO) ENN estimator is proposed to improve the control performance and robustness of the PFNS. The ENN estimator is proposed to estimate the hysteresis phenomenon and lumped uncertainty, including the system parameters and external disturbance of the PFNS online. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the training of the parameters of the ENN online are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, two robust compensators are proposed to confront the minimum reconstructed errors in INTSMC.

The zeta potentials of differently treated nanodiamond (ND) particles in aqueous colloids are adjusted to the zeta potential of AlN in water. Thereby, the nucleation density for the initial growth of diamond on AlN can be varied from very low (10(8)\u00a0cm(-2)), in the case of hydrogen-treated ND seeding particles, to very high values of 10(11)\u00a0cm(-2) for oxidized ND particles. Our approach yielding high nucleation densities allows the growth of very thin NCD films on AlN with thicknesses as low as 40\u00a0nm for applications such as microelectromechanical beam resonators.

In this study, the fouling potential of organic materials in seawater was investigated using model seawater solution containing humic acid and alginate. The buildup of organic fouling on UF membranes was studied after consecutive filtration cycles with periodical backwash. The effects of varying backwash conditions (duration, frequency, permeate/deionized water) on membrane performance were analysed. It was observed that the variation in filtration condition resulted in minor differences in membrane performance provided the total backwash volume applied remained constant. However, the substitution of permeate water backwash with deionized water improved fouling reversibility significantly. Furthermore, advanced characterisation of the membrane fouling layer after filtration revealed significant differences in foulant distribution due to the nature of the backwash solution. Deionized water backwash was found to be particularly effective in removing alginate from the membrane fouling layer, although the humic acid adsorbed onto the membrane surface were not significantly affected. However, permeability testing of the membranes after chemical cleaning revealed higher levels of irrecoverable fouling after deionized water backwash. From the data obtained in this study, a fouling mechanism is therefore proposed, in which the alginate fouling layer performs as a dynamic membrane, prefiltering smaller humic acid molecules and reducing adsorption on the membrane surface.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["AdhikaraResosudarmo", "YunYe", "PierreLe-Clech", "VickiChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2012.11.024"}

There is considerable interest in cell repair following damage mediated by dental surgical procedures. Cells can tolerate stress by expressing heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). During and after surgical tooth removal, oxidative stress can activate Hsp70 expression proportional to the intensity of the stress signal stimulus to cope with stress. This study examined the expression of Hsp70 as a potential biomarker of immediate postoperative stress in patients undergoing two different surgical procedures of different severity. Expression of Hsp70 both at mRNA and at protein level in the conventional group was two-fold higher than that of the piezo group. This suggests that tooth movement by the piezo method causes relatively lower stress in the alveolar bone. Piezosurgery provides relatively low stress to the patients and this may help cell repair after the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing more aggressive surgery using conventional methods showed a significant increase in Hsp70 in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, Hsp70 induction can be a potential tool as a prognostic surgical marker.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2012-12-01", "authors": ["YG\u00fclnahar", "HH\u00fcseyin K\u00f6\u015fger", "YTutar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2012.10.027"}

It is shown that GO platelets induce the formation of \u03b3 phase when crystallizing from solution, but only \u03b1 phase forms from melt crystallization. The crystallization kinetics of \u03b1 phase is promoted due to heterogeneous nucleation ability of GO, which is probably originated from a weak \u03c0-dipole interaction between GO and PVDF. Intriguingly, after introduction of strong ion-dipole interactions between GO and PVDF by addition of an ionic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB), a significant amount of \u03b3 crystals are obtained during isothermal melt crystallization. Time-resolved FTIR results further provide a detailed evolution of the \u03b3 phase formation, and there are two distinct stages during the melt crystallization in the PVDF/GO composites in the presence of CTAB, i.e., a simultaneous growth of \u03b3 and \u03b1 phases in the first stage, and a solid \u03b1 to \u03b3 transition in the second stage.

To save an additional torque sensor, the intrinsic measurement capabilities of the piezoelectric material can be employed. To prove feasibility, a motor setup with clearly separated actuation for the friction and driving forces is chosen. The motor concept is based on resonant ultrasonic vibrations. To assess the effects of the direct piezoelectric effect, a capacitance bridge-type circuit has been selected. Signal processing is done by a measurement card with an integrated field-programmable gate array. The motor is used to drive a winch, and different torques are applied by means of weights to be lifted. Assessing the bridge voltage, a good proportionality to the applied torque of 1.47 mV/mN\u00b7m is shown. A hysteresis of 1% has been determined. The chosen motor concept is useful for intrinsic torque measurement. However, it provides drawbacks in terms of limited mechanical performance, wear, and thermal losses because of the soft piezoelectric material.

In this paper, an improvement of the Legendre polynomial approach is proposed to solve wave propagation in what, from now on, we will call general multilayered piezoelectric cylindrical plates, to mean indifferently with or without very dissimilar materials. Detailed formulations are given to highlight the differences from the conventional Legendre polynomial approach. Through numerical comparisons among the exact solution (from the reverberation-ray matrix), the conventional polynomial approach, and the improved polynomial approach, the validity of the proposed approach is illustrated. Then, the influences of the radius-to-thickness ratio on the dispersion curves, the stress, and electric displacement distributions are discussed. It is shown that the conventional orthogonal polynomial approach cannot obtain correct continuous normal stress and normal electric displacement shapes, unlike the improved orthogonal polynomial approach, which overcomes these drawbacks. It is also found that three factors determine the distribution of mechanical energy and electric energy at higher frequencies: the radius-to-thickness ratio, the wave speed of component material, and the position of the component material.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-11-30", "authors": ["JiangongYu", "Jean-EtienneLefebvre", "YongqiangGuo", "LahoucineElmaimouni"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2482"}

The model we present is developed to allow for accurate channel performance prediction while greatly reducing the computational complexity associated with 2- and 3-dimensional finite element analysis. As a result, the model primarily considers 1-dimensional wave propagation; however, approximate solutions for higher-dimensional phenomena (e.g., diffraction in the SPPT's metallic core layer) are also incorporated. The model is then assessed by comparing it to the measured wideband frequency response of a physical SPPT-based channel from our previous work.

Using the waveform features obtained by this sensor, measurement errors of 0.7\u00b12.5 and 1.27\u00b14.53 mmHg were obtained for the systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively.

{"title": "Application of piezoelectric device in endoscopic sinus surgery.", "abstract": "New applications of piezoelectric device have been already documented from otologic and ophthalmic endoscopic studies. The authors describe a first experience in endoscopic sinus surgery with piezosurgery to approach the paranasal sinus. Patients involved in this study presented for rhinogenous headache, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and sinusitis. Radiological studies such as computed tomography of paranasal sinus and a correct clinical examination with a rigid endoscope 0 degrees were carried out, to exclude from the procedure patients with polyposis or other soft-tissue diseases. In fact, because of piezosurgery properties of micrometric and selected cutting on mineralized tissues, it has been used only to treat bone or cartilage anomalies of nasal sinus. The main advantages of the technique include soft-tissue protection and optimal visibility in the surgical field with decreased blood loss. From this preliminary report, the stability of mucous membrane previously cut has been documented by endoscopic follow-up, and the resolution of the main symptom of headache was referred. The main indications for piezosurgery shown in literature are in oral surgery, such as sinus lift, bone graft harvesting, osteogenic distraction, ridge expansion, endodontic surgery, and periodontal surgery. Other applications have been shown in otology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and orthopedics.

For most 2-D arrays, high-resolution imagery is desired, which requires a large aperture at the cost of a large number of elements. The proposed array's geometry is sparse, with elements only on the boundary of the rectangular aperture. The missing information from the interior is filled in using linear imaging techniques. After receiving acoustic emissions during ultrasound therapy, this algorithm applies an apodization to the sparse aperture to limit side lobes and then reconstructs acoustic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution.

As an analytical effort, we have derived the corrected fifth-order Mindlin plate equations with the consideration of electric potential and overtone displacements.

{"title": "An open system for intravascular ultrasound imaging.", "abstract": "Visualization of the blood vessels can provide valuable morphological information for diagnosis and therapy strategies for cardiovascular disease. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is able to delineate internal structures of vessel wall with fine spatial resolution. However, the developed IVUS is insufficient to identify the fibrous cap thickness and tissue composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Novel imaging strategies have been proposed, such as increasing the center frequency of ultrasound or using a modulated excitation technique to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Dual-mode tomography combining IVUS with optical tomography has also been developed to determine tissue morphology and characteristics. The implementation of these new imaging methods requires an open system that allows users to customize the system for various studies. This paper presents the development of an IVUS system that has open structures to support various imaging strategies. The system design is based on electronic components and printed circuit board, and provides reconfigurable hardware implementation, programmable image processing algorithms, flexible imaging control, and raw RF data acquisition. In addition, the proposed IVUS system utilized a miniaturized ultrasound transducer constructed using PMNPT single crystal for better piezoelectric constant and electromechanical coupling coefficient than traditional lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics. Testing results showed that the IVUS system could offer a minimum detectable signal of 25 \u03bcV, allowing a 51 dB dynamic range at 47 dB gain, with a frequency range from 20 to 80 MHz.

{"title": "Power enhancement of piezoelectric transformers by adding heat transfer equipment.", "abstract": "It is known that piezoelectric transformers have several inherent advantages compared with conventional electromagnetic transformers. However, the maximum power capacity of piezoelectric transformers is not as large as electromagnetic transformers in practice, especially in the case of high output current. The theoretical power density of piezoelectric transformers calculated by stress boundary can reach 330 W/cm(3), but no piezoelectric transformer has ever reached such a high power density in practice. The power density of piezoelectric transformers is limited to 33 W/cm(3) in practical applications. The underlying reason is that the maximum passing current of the piezoelectric material (mechanical current) is limited by the temperature rise caused by heat generation. To increase this current and the power capacity, we proposed to add a thermal pad to the piezoelectric transformer to dissipate heat. The experimental results showed that the proposed techniques can increase by 3 times the output current of the piezoelectric transformer. A theoretical-phenomenological model which explains the relationship between vibration velocity and generated heat is also established to verify the experimental results.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-11-13", "authors": ["Yu-HaoSu", "Yuan-PingLiu", "DejanVasic", "Wen-JongWu", "Fran\u00e7oisCosta", "Chih-KungLee"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2439"}

{"title": "Sensitive cylindrical SERS substrate array for rapid microanalysis of nucleobases.", "abstract": "In this work, a cylindrical-substrate array for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements was developed to enable analysis of nucleobases in a few microliters of liquid. To eliminate uncertainties associated with SERS detection of aqueous samples, a new type of cylindrical SERS substrate was designed to confine the aqueous sample at the tip of the SERS probe. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) optical fibers in a series of different diameters were used as the basic substrate. A solution of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/dimethylformamide (PVDF/DMF) was used to coat the tip of each fiber to increase the surface roughness and facilitate adsorption of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for enhancing Raman signals. A chemical reduction method was used to form AgNPs in and on the PVDF coating layer. The reagents and reaction conditions were systematically examined with the aim of estimating the optimum parameters. Unlike the spreading of aqueous sample on most SERS substrates, particularly flat ones, the new SERS substrates showed enough hydrophobicity to restrict aqueous sample to the tip area, thus enabling quantitative analysis. The required volume of sample could be as low as 1 \u03bcL with no need for a drying step in the procedure. By aligning the cylindrical SERS substrates into a solid holder, an array of cylindrical substrates was produced for mass analysis of aqueous samples. This new substrate improves both reproducibility and sensitivity for detection in aqueous samples. The enhancement factor approaches 7 orders in magnitude with a relative standard error close to 8%. Using the optimized conditions, nucleobases of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil could be detected with limits approaching a few hundreds nanomolar in only a few microliters of solution.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2012-11-13", "authors": ["PanneerselvamRajapandiyan", "JyisyYang"], "doi": "10.1021/ac302175q"}

The PVA functionalization of graphene surface can not only prevent the agglomeration of original rGO but also enhance the interaction between PVDF and rGO-PVA. Strong hydrogen bonds and charge transfer effect between rGO-PVA and PVDF were determined by infrared and Raman spectroscopies.

These flow sensors can be wrapped around a blood vessel and accurately measure flow. The innovation that makes this flow sensor possible is the diffraction-grating transducer. A conventional transducer produces a sound beam perpendicular to its face; therefore, when placed on the wall of a blood vessel, the Doppler shift in the backscattered ultrasound from blood theoretically would be 0. The diffraction-grating transducer produces a beam at a known angle to its face; therefore, backscattered ultrasound from the vessel will contain a Doppler signal. Flow sensors were fabricated by spin coating a poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) copolymer film onto a flexible substrate with patterned gold electrodes. Custom-designed battery-operated continuous wave Doppler electronics along with a laptop computer completed the system. A prototype flow sensor was evaluated experimentally by measuring blood flow in a flow phantom and the infrarenal aorta of an adult New Zealand White rabbit. The flow phantom experiment demonstrated that the error in average velocity and volume blood flow was less than 6% for 30 measurements taken over a 2.5-hour period. The peak blood velocity through the rabbit infrarenal aorta measured by the flow sensor was 118 cm/s, within 1.7% of the measurement obtained using a duplex ultrasound system. The flow sensor and electronics operated continuously during the course of the 5-hour experiment after the incision on the animal was closed.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2012-10-24", "authors": ["Jonathan MCannata", "ThomasChilipka", "Hao-ChungYang", "SukguHan", "Sung WHam", "Vincent LRowe", "Fred AWeaver", "K KirkShung", "DavidVilkomerson"], "doi": "10.7863/jum.2012.31.11.1795"}
{"title": "Effect of wastewater colloids on membrane removal of antibiotic resistance genes.", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significantly alter the magnitude and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in receiving environments, indicating that wastewater treatment represents an important node for limiting ARG dissemination. This study examined the potential for membrane treatment of microconstituent ARGs and the effect of native wastewater colloids on the extent of their removal. Plasmids containing vanA (vancomycin) and bla(TEM) (\u03b2-lactam) ARGs were spiked into three representative WWTP effluents versus a control buffer and tracked by quantitative polymerase chain reaction through a cascade of microfiltration and ultrafiltration steps ranging from 0.45 \u03bcm to 1 kDa. Significant removal of ARGs was achieved by membranes of 100 kDa and smaller, and presence of wastewater colloids resulted in enhanced removal by 10 kDa and 1 kDa membranes. ARG removal was observed to correlate significantly with the corresponding protein, polysaccharide, and total organic carbon colloidal fractions. Alumina membranes removed ARGs to a greater extent than polyvinylidene fluoride membranes of the same pore size (0.1 \u03bcm), but only in the presence of wastewater material. Control studies confirmed that membrane treatment was the primary mechanism of ARG removal, versus other potential sources of loss. This study suggests that advanced membrane treatment technology is promising for managing public health risks of ARGs in wastewater effluents and that removal may even be enhanced by colloids in real-world wastewaters.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-10-24", "authors": ["Maria V RiquelmeBreazeal", "John TNovak", "Peter JVikesland", "AmyPruden"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2012.09.044"}
{"title": "The scanning ion conductance microscope for cellular physiology.", "abstract": "The quest for nonoptical imaging methods that can surmount light diffraction limits resulted in the development of scanning probe microscopes. However, most of the existing methods are not quite suitable for studying biological samples. The scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) bridges the gap between the resolution capabilities of atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope and functional capabilities of conventional light microscope. A nanopipette mounted on a three-axis piezo-actuator, scans a sample of interest and ion current is measured between the pipette tip and the sample. The feedback control system always keeps a certain distance between the sample and the pipette so the pipette never touches the sample. At the same time pipette movement is recorded and this generates a three-dimensional topographical image of the sample surface. SICM represents an alternative to conventional high-resolution microscopy, especially in imaging topography of live biological samples. In addition, the nanopipette probe provides a host of added modalities, for example using the same pipette and feedback control for efficient approach and seal with the cell membrane for ion channel recording. SICM can be combined in one instrument with optical and fluorescent methods and allows drawing structure-function correlations. It can also be used for precise mechanical force measurements as well as vehicle to apply pressure with precision. This can be done on living cells and tissues for prolonged periods of time without them loosing viability. The SICM is a multifunctional instrument, and it is maturing rapidly and will open even more possibilities in the near future.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Diagnostic and prognostic value of calcium oscillatory pattern analysis for patients with ICSI fertilization failure.", "abstract": "Does calcium oscillatory pattern analysis following heterologous intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of human sperm into mouse oocytes lead to diagnostic and prognostic information for patients suffering from ICSI fertilization failure?\nWe found that calcium oscillatory pattern analysis following heterologous ICSI has the strength to reveal, for the individual patient, the most probable underlying reason for low or failed fertilization after conventional ICSI.\nFertilization failure occurs in 1-3% of the couples undergoing conventional ICSI, for whom the mouse oocyte activation test (MOAT) or a similar heterologous ICSI model is the only diagnostic test available to evaluate the oocyte-activating capacity of human sperm cells. The MOAT classifies the patients into three groups: a low (group 1), an intermediate (group 2) and a high (group 3) activating group. In MOAT group 1 patients, a sperm-related deficiency is likely to be the cause of previous fertilization failures, while in MOAT group 3 patients a sperm-related deficiency can most probably be refuted. For MOAT group 2 patients, the result is called inconclusive; hence, both sperm and oocyte deficiencies may still contribute to the previous ICSI fertilization failure.\nThe calcium-releasing ability of sperm from 26 MOAT patients with a history of zero or low fertilization following conventional ICSI was compared with the calcium-releasing ability of sperm from 4 control patients, with proven oocyte activation potential. Per case an average of 19 mouse oocytes were injected. Calcium imaging started within 5-10 min after ICSI and continued for 2 h.\nHuman sperm were demembranated with 0.02% lysolecithin for 1 min immediately before heterologous piezo-driven ICSI. For calcium imaging, metaphase II oocytes from B6D2/F1 mice were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. The calcium oscillatory patterns following heterologous ICSI were scored per oocyte and per patient individually based on the presence of calcium spikes and their frequency and amplitude.\nFor patients with low or high MOAT activating capacity (MOAT group 1 or 3, respectively), calcium analysis confirmed the MOAT result. For patients with a former inconclusive intermediate MOAT activating capacity result (MOAT group 2), no or strongly dissimilar calcium oscillatory patterns were seen, with significantly lower amplitude and frequency compared with control sperm. When the product of the amplitude and the frequency of the calcium traces was compared between the groups, MOAT group 1 and 2 cases differed significantly from MOAT group 3 cases and the control sperm (P < 0.01).\nThe results of the calcium analysis in mouse oocytes should not be directly extrapolated to human oocytes, since it is well known that human spermatozoa exhibit a greater activating potency in mouse oocytes compared with mouse spermatozoa. Furthermore, not much is known yet about the influence of aberrant calcium oscillatory patterns, such as found in MOAT group 2 patients, on pre- and post-implantation embryo development in the human.\nBased on the current calcium oscillatory pattern analysis, we found that the product of calcium spike amplitude with its frequency allowed us to create a new threshold value, which can assist in confirming or refuting, on a single patient base, a sperm-borne activation deficiency. The latter is especially interesting for patients with a former intermediate inconclusive MOAT result (MOAT group 2 patients), for whom calcium oscillatory pattern analysis should be considered.\nF.V.M. is holder of an aspirant clinical research mandate by the Flemish foundation of Scientific Research (FWO-Vlaanderen).

Au on p-Si produces a low Schottky barrier (0.33 eV), which improves the internal quantum efficiency. Thick and thin Au stripes are compared, with the latter increasing the hot hole emission probability relative to the former, and thus also improving the internal quantum efficiency. Two excitation schemes are considered: end facet illumination which launches surface plasmons on the detector, and top illumination which does not. Both schemes are implemented using a piezoelectric positioner that is programmed to scan the detection area in steps of 100-200 nm, thus enabling the acquisition of high-resolution photocurrent maps. The surface plasmon detectors yield a responsivity of ~1 mA W(-1), ~2\u00d7 larger than the same detectors under top illumination, due to the absorption of surface plasmons. We compare the measurements with theoretical results for both excitation schemes and estimate the hot hole attenuation length in our Au stripes to be ~23 nm.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2012-10-20", "authors": ["PierreBerini", "AnthonyOlivieri", "ChengkunChen"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/23/44/444011"}

However, stable injection of cells has proven difficult, owing to the frequent occurrence of nozzle clogging. In this paper, a piezoelectric inkjet head constructed with a glass capillary that enabled viewing of the nozzle section was developed, the movement of cells ejected from the nozzle tip was analyzed, and a method for stably ejecting cells was verified. A pull-push ejection method was compared with a push-pull ejection method regarding the voltage waveform applied to the piezoelectric element of the head. The push-pull method was found to be more suitable for stable ejection. Further, ejection of one cell per droplet was realized by detecting the position of the cell in the nozzle section and utilizing these position data. Thus, a method for more precise patterning of viable cells at desired position and number was established.

{"title": "Rules for scoring respiratory events in sleep: update of the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Deliberations of the Sleep Apnea Definitions Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.", "abstract": "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Sleep Apnea Definitions Task Force reviewed the current rules for scoring respiratory events in the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring and Sleep and Associated Events to determine if revision was indicated. The goals of the task force were (1) to clarify and simplify the current scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. The task force reviewed the evidence cited by the AASM systematic review of the reliability and validity of scoring respiratory events published in 2007 and relevant studies that have appeared in the literature since that publication. Given the limitations of the published evidence, a consensus process was used to formulate the majority of the task force recommendations concerning revisions.The task force made recommendations concerning recommended and alternative sensors for the detection of apnea and hypopnea to be used during diagnostic and positive airway pressure (PAP) titration polysomnography. An alternative sensor is used if the recommended sensor fails or the signal is inaccurate. The PAP device flow signal is the recommended sensor for the detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration studies. Appropriate filter settings for recording (display) of the nasal pressure signal to facilitate visualization of inspiratory flattening are also specified. The respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals to be used as alternative sensors for apnea and hypopnea detection are specified. The task force reached consensus on use of the same sensors for adult and pediatric patients except for the following: (1) the end-tidal PCO(2) signal can be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in children only, and (2) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) belts can be used to monitor respiratory effort (thoracoabdominal belts) and as an alternative sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea (PVDFsum) only in adults.The task force recommends the following changes to the 2007 respiratory scoring rules. Apnea in adults is scored when there is a drop in the peak signal excursion by \u2265 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative apnea sensor, for \u2265 10 seconds. Hypopnea in adults is scored when the peak signal excursions drop by \u2265 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for \u2265 10 seconds in association with either \u2265 3% arterial oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Scoring a hypopnea as either obstructive or central is now listed as optional, and the recommended scoring rules are presented. In children an apnea is scored when peak signal excursions drop by \u2265 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor; and the event meets duration and respiratory effort criteria for an obstructive, mixed, or central apnea. A central apnea is scored in children when the event meets criteria for an apnea, there is an absence of inspiratory effort throughout the event, and at least one of the following is met: (1) the event is \u2265 20 seconds in duration, (2) the event is associated with an arousal or \u2265 3% oxygen desaturation, (3) (infants under 1 year of age only) the event is associated with a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute for at least 5 seconds or less than 60 beats per minute for 15 seconds. A hypopnea is scored in children when the peak signal excursions drop is \u2265 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for \u2265 the duration of 2 breaths in association with either \u2265 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. In children and adults, surrogates of the arterial PCO(2) are the end-tidal PCO(2) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (diagnostic study) or transcutaneous PCO(2) (titration study). For adults, sleep hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 55 mm Hg for \u2265 10 minutes or there is an increase in the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) \u2265 10 mm Hg (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value exceeding 50 mm Hg for \u2265 10 minutes. For pediatric patients hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO(2) (or surrogate) is > 50 mm Hg for > 25% of total sleep time. In adults Cheyne-Stokes breathing is scored when both of the following are met: (1) there are episodes of \u2265 3 consecutive central apneas and/or central hypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing amplitude with a cycle length of at least 40 seconds (typically 45 to 90 seconds), and (2) there are five or more central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern recorded over a minimum of 2 hours of monitoring.", "journal": "Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine", "date": "2012-10-16", "authors": ["Richard BBerry", "RohitBudhiraja", "Daniel JGottlieb", "DavidGozal", "ConradIber", "Vishesh KKapur", "Carole LMarcus", "ReenaMehra", "SairamParthasarathy", "Stuart FQuan", "SusanRedline", "Kingman PStrohl", "Sally LDavidson Ward", "Michelle MTangredi", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.5664/jcsm.2172"}

Using both XRD and SEM-EDX, it was identified as Co(2)TiO(4) for dopant levels >0.5 mol%. In addition, a certain amount of cobalt was incorporated into BNT, as shown by electron probe microanalysis. This amount increased with increasing dopant levels, suggesting that an equilibrium forms together with the secondary phase.

These elements form the basic building blocks of a viable, un-tethered, and portable ultrasound applicator that can produce intensities on the order of 100mW/cm(2) spatial-peak temporal-peak (I(SPTP)) with minimum (on the order of 15V) excitation voltage. The ultrasound applicator can be constructed with different numbers of individual transducer elements and different geometries such that its footprint or active area is adjustable. The primary motivation behind this research was to develop a tether-free, battery operated, fully portable ultrasound applicator for therapeutic applications such as wound healing and non-invasive transdermal delivery of both naked and encapsulated drugs. It is shown that careful selection of the components determining applicator architecture allows the displacement amplitude to be maximized for a specific frequency of operation. The work described here used the finite-element analysis software COMSOL to identify the geometry and material properties that permit the applicator's design to be optimized. By minimizing the excitation voltage required to achieve the desired output (100mW/cm(2)I(SPTP)) the power source (rechargeable Li-Polymer batteries) size may be reduced permitting both the electronics and ultrasound applicator to fit in a wearable housing.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-10-09", "authors": ["Christopher RBawiec", "YouhanSunny", "An TNguyen", "Joshua ASamuels", "Michael SWeingarten", "Leonid AZubkov", "Peter ALewin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.09.005"}
{"title": "Acoustic metamaterials with circular sector cavities and programmable densities.", "abstract": "Considerable interest has been devoted to the development of various classes of acoustic metamaterials that can control the propagation of acoustical wave energy throughout fluid domains. However, all the currently exerted efforts are focused on studying passive metamaterials with fixed material properties. In this paper, the emphasis is placed on the development of a class of composite one-dimensional acoustic metamaterials with effective densities that are programmed to adapt to any prescribed pattern along the metamaterial. The proposed acoustic metamaterial is composed of a periodic arrangement of cell structures, in which each cell consists of a circular sector cavity bounded by actively controlled flexible panels to provide the capability for manipulating the overall effective dynamic density. The theoretical analysis of this class of multilayered composite active acoustic metamaterials (CAAMM) is presented and the theoretical predictions are determined for a cascading array of fluid cavities coupled to flexible piezoelectric active boundaries forming the metamaterial domain with programmable dynamic density. The stiffness of the piezoelectric boundaries is electrically manipulated to control the overall density of the individual cells utilizing the strong coupling with the fluid domain and using direct acoustic pressure feedback. The interaction between the neighboring cells of the composite metamaterial is modeled using a lumped-parameter approach. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the proposed CAAMM and its potential for generating prescribed spatial and spectral patterns of density variation.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2012-10-09", "authors": ["WAkl", "AElsabbagh", "ABaz"], "doi": "10.1121/1.4744936"}

{"title": "Ferroelectric control of magnetocrystalline anisotropy at cobalt/poly(vinylidene fluoride) interfaces.", "abstract": "Electric field control of magnetization is one of the promising avenues for achieving high-density energy-efficient magnetic data storage. Ferroelectric materials can be especially useful for that purpose as a source of very large switchable electric fields when interfaced with a ferromagnet. Organic ferroelectrics, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), have an additional advantage of being weakly bonded to the ferromagnet, thus minimizing undesirable effects such as interface chemical modification and/or strain coupling. In this work we use first-principles density functional calculations of Co/PVDF heterostructures to demonstrate the effect of ferroelectric polarization of PVDF on the interface magnetocrystalline anisotropy that controls the magnetization orientation. We show that switching of the polarization direction alters the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of the adjacent Co layer by about 50%, driven by the modification of the screening charge induced by ferroelectric polarization. The effect is reduced with Co oxidation at the interface due to quenching the interface magnetization. Our results provide a new insight into the mechanism of the magnetoelectric coupling at organic ferroelectric/ferromagnet interfaces and suggest ways to achieve the desired functionality in practice.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2012-10-09", "authors": ["Pavel VLukashev", "Tula RPaudel", "Juan ML\u00f3pez-Encarnaci\u00f3n", "ShireenAdenwalla", "Evgeny YTsymbal", "Julian PVelev"], "doi": "10.1021/nn303212h"}

The molecular scanning of individual ganglioside molecular species showed a significant reduction of d20 : 1/C18 : 0 ceramide-containing gangliosides in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

{"title": "Selected fascial aspects of osteopathic practice.", "abstract": "Fascia is a connective tissue organised as a three-dimensional network that surrounds, supports, suspends, protects, connects and divides muscular, skeletal and visceral components of the body. Studies suggest that fascia reorganises itself along the lines of tension imposed or expressed in the body, and in ways that may cause repercussions to fascial restriction that are body-wide. This may potentially create stress on any structures enveloped by fascia itself, with consequent mechanical and physiological effects. From an osteopathic perspective, fascial techniques aim to release such tensions, decrease pain and restore function. The proposed mechanism for fascial techniques is based on various studies that have looked at the plastic, viscoelastic and piezoelectric properties of connective tissue.

With the presence of reduced graphene (RG) nano sheets in the nanocomposite, the structure of PVDF is transformed from alpha to beta phase, and the beta phase fraction and its crystallinity are largely affected by the RG content. The PVDF thermal stability is improved by the RG introduction, with about 15 degrees C increase of the half-life of PVDF decomposition temperature. The RG/PVDF nanocomposites show a better electrical conductivity than that for the GO/PVDF nanocomposites.

{"title": "Enhancing high-rate and elevated-temperature performances of nano-sized and micron-sized LiMn2O4 in lithium-ion batteries with ultrathin surface coatings.", "abstract": "LiMn2O4 suffers from severe capacity degradation when used as a cathode material in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, especially when cycled at high rates and elevated temperatures. To enhance its high-rate electrochemical performance at elevated temperature (55 degrees C), we use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit ultrathin and highly conformal Al2O3 coatings (as thin as 0.72 nm) onto micron-sized and nano-sized LiMn2O4 with precise thickness-control at atomic scale. All ALD-modified electrodes exhibit significantly improved capacities and cycling stability compared to bare electrodes. In particular, the effect of ALD coating to improve electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 is more distinct for nano-sized LiMn2O4 than for micron-sized LiMn2O4, and more distinct for electrochemical cycling at higher charge/discharge rates. For example, nano-LiMn2O4 electrode coated with 6 Al2O3 ALD layers delivers higher initial capacity (124.7 mA h/g) and final capacity (106.7 mA h/g) after 100 cycles than bare electrode with an initial capacity of 112.3 mA h/g and a final capacity of only 95.5 mA h/g, when cycled at a very high rate of 5 C at 55 degrees C. In addition, nano-LiMn2O4 electrodes show much better rate performance than micron-LiMn2O4 electrodes at 5 C. The enhanced electrochemical performance of ALD-modified LiMn2O4 is ascribed to high-quality ALD oxide coatings that are highly conformal, dense, complete, and thus protect active material from severe dissolution, and to a formed robust glass layer on the surface of LiMn2O4 that suppress its crystallographic transformation during electrochemical cycling. Surface modifications of LiMn2O4 are also carried out by either ALD coating directly onto the entire LiMn2O4/carbon/PVDF composite electrode or coating only on LiMn2O4 particles in electrode. The former results in more significantly improved electrochemical performance of cathode, possibly because ALD coating onto entire electrode provides better mechanical integrity and preserves contact between LiMn2O4 particles and carbon/poly-vinylidenefluoride network.", "journal": "Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology", "date": "2012-10-06", "authors": ["XinningLuan", "DongshengGuan", "YingWang"], "doi": "10.1166/jnn.2012.6577"}

Hence, the main goal of dental scaling is to remove bacterial plaque and obtain smoother tooth surfaces. This study was aimed to assess the influence of tip wear of ultrasonic scaler inserts on root surface roughness at different working parameters. Twenty piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler inserts (10 worn/10 new) were selected to examine the erosion ratio (ER) on the scaler tips and to assess the influence of tip wear on root surface roughness. Erosion on the tip surfaces was evaluated under atomic force microscopy (AFM). Root samples were prepared and instrumented by new (Group I) and worn (Group II) inserts at different working parameters. Roughness change (Rc) on root surfaces after instrumentation was examined under profilometer and compared between and within the groups. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean ERs of new and worn tips (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The results of this study showed that tip angulation and instrument power strongly influenced the Rc values on instrumented samples (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Moreover, the new device offers striking advantages with respect to force calibration and sample deformation measurements. Force calibration is performed using the eigenfrequency of the force detection system directly inside the SEM. Deformation data are obtained with high accuracy by simultaneously recording displacements above and below the specimen. The detrimental apparatus compliance is determined, and the influence on measured data subsequently minimized: an easy to validate two-springs-in-series model is used for data correction.

The proposed method facilities the measurement of resonant vibration, and provides stable and clear interference fringes. This study investigated the third in-plane eigenmode of a thin piezoelectric plate, using the finite element method and an impedance analyzer to verify the dynamic response obtained using the proposed method. We analyzed the vibration amplitude of interference fringes to obtain quantitative results on the sub-micron scale. The close agreement between the experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of using the frequency-sweeping function to obtain the resonant states and provides an accurate prediction of resonance. Furthermore, statistical analysis of interference fringes obtained using the subtractive, mean, and the standard deviation method is performed.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) polysomnography guidelines recommend the use of respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) belts but not piezoelectrode (PE) belts for measuring chest and abdominal movements. To compare these two sensors, we measured the signal amplitude for 10 RIP belts and 10 PE belts stretched by mechanical distraction across six distances (2.5 to 15.0 centimeters) and replicated 10 times for each belt. Amplitudes were measured using the Stellate Harmonie (Stellate Systems, Inc., Natus Medical, Inc., San Carlos, California, USA) recording system. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficient was calculated. All RIP belts performed well at all distraction lengths and demonstrated linear performance. Eight of 10 PE belts performed well through all measures whereas, two showed nonlinear increase in signal on stretch of greater than 12.5 centimeters. Signals from PE belts highly correlated with the distance of distraction (r = 0.96 to 0.99) and the RIP belts (r = 0.98 to 0.99). These results suggest that PE belts perform similarly to RIP belts at distraction distances up to 10.0 centimeters.

{"title": "Tactile multisensing on flexible aluminum nitride.", "abstract": "The integration of a polycrystalline material such as aluminum nitride (AlN) on a flexible substrate allows the realization of elastic tactile sensors showing both piezoelectricity and significant capacitive variation under normal stress. The application of a normal stress on AlN generates deformation of the flexible substrate on which AlN is grown, which results in strain gradient of the polycrystalline layer. The strain gradient is responsible for an additional polarization described in the literature as the flexoelectric effect, leading to an enhancement of the transduction properties of the material. The flexible AlN is synthesized by sputtering deposition on kapton HN (poly 4,4'-oxydiphenyl pyromellitimide) in a highly oriented crystal structure. High orientation is demonstrated by X-ray diffraction spectra (FWHM = 0.55\u00b0 of AlN (0002)) and HRTEM.

In this work, piezoelectric immunosensors were constructed for the detection of atrazine through the immobilization of specific monoclonal anti-atrazine antibodies on thiolated modified quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs). The immunoassay was conducted by a novel drop-deposition procedure using different atrazine dilutions in phosphate buffer solution ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-1) mg/mL. The immunoreactions between varying contents of atrazine and its antibody were dynamically exhibited through in situ monitoring of the frequency and motional resistance changes over 20 min. Thus, atrazine recognition by the anti-atrazine antibody leads to a decrease of the resonant frequency that is proportional to a given atrazine concentration. Interestingly, the motional resistance also increased proportionally during the measurements, which could be attributed to the specific viscoelastic properties and/or conformation changes of the antibodies once the immunoreactions occurred. By combining the measurements of frequency with those of motional resistance, additional information was provided about the interaction between the atrazine-named antigen and its respective antibody. Finally, the analytical specificity of the immunosensor to atrazine was evaluated through the response to a nonspecific anti-human IgG antibody-modified QCM crystal under the same drop conditions.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-09-26", "authors": ["KunJia", "Timoth\u00e9eToury", "Rodica ElenaIonescu"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2421"}

This paper presents a piezoelectric active mirror suspension system embedded into LTCC. In the structure, the LTCC was used as a package, for the passive layers of piezoelectric monomorphs, as support for the mirrors, and as a substrate for the conductors. The active mirror structure, 17 mm in diameter, was made by compiling 20 LTCC layers using common LTCC processing techniques. Each sample contained a laser-micromachined bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT) structure which formed a monomorph with the LTCC during the firing process. A mirror substrate (diameter 4 mm) was mounted in the middle of the monomorph arms for evaluation of the positioning performance, where each of the three arms had independent signal electrodes and a common ground electrode. Electrical and electromechanical properties were investigated with an LCR meter, network analyzer, and laser vibrometer for the different arms and the mirror.

Simultaneously, the polymer should effectively prevent adherence of smooth muscle cells (SMC) and thereby inhibiting restenosis. The aim of this study was to gain a basic understanding on the interaction of SMC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with nonporous polymer films.

The films were analyzed according to their thermomechanical and surface properties before being examined in contact with HUVEC and SMC concerning cell viability, proliferation and adhesion. Experimental results showed that adhesion could be improved for HUVEC on PDC compared to PPDO and PVDF. In contrast, SMC attachment is largely suppressed on PDC polymeric films indicating a cell-specific response of HUVEC towards PDC.

It is demonstrated that the device's electric output behavior can be optionally changed between four types of mode simply by controlling the straining rate. Furthermore, it is also shown that the electric output can be enhanced by scaling the size of the device. This energy-harvesting technology provides a simple and cost-effective platform to capture low-frequency mechanical energy, such as body movements, for practical applications.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2012-09-14", "authors": ["YuQiu", "HeqiuZhang", "LizhongHu", "DechaoYang", "LinaWang", "BinWang", "JiuyuJi", "GuoqiangLiu", "XinLiu", "JianfanLin", "FeiLi", "ShijunHan"], "doi": "10.1039/c2nr31031g"}

The primary radiation forces arise as a nonlinear effect when an acoustic wave interacts with a particle. For specific robotic applications, precise control of the acoustic field in the cavity is important, which is excited, for example, by piezoelectric transducers attached to the device. Based on Gor'kov's potential the relevant forces on spherical particles can be computed. The field can be controlled by varying the excitation parameters: chamber and electrode configuration, as well as frequency, amplitude and phase of the excitation and their modulation. In the first part of the present tutorial, a number of examples are described: displacement and rotation of particles in micro machined chambers and macroscopic transport of particles in a larger chamber. In the second part, numerical tools (Finite Volume Method, COMSOL) are used to model the interaction of the acoustic field with a particle beyond a Gor'kov potential: viscosity, effects of walls near particles and acoustic radiation torque to rotate the particle. Excellent agreement between the various methods has been found.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2012-09-14", "authors": ["J\u00fcrgDual", "PhilippHahn", "IvoLeibacher", "DirkM\u00f6ller", "ThomasSchwarz", "JingtaoWang"], "doi": "10.1039/c2lc40733g"}

Here, we first carried out a subjective softness evaluation test using 65 skin models consisting of polyurethane bilayers with different thickness of the superficial layer and different degree of cross-polymerization of the basal layer. The results showed that perceived softness was dependent on the mechanical properties of both the superficial and basal layers. Then, we used a recently developed tactile sensor system composed of a piezoelectric tactile sensor and a load cell to measure mechanical softness parameters of the superficial layer and the whole model, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the data obtained from these two sensors were well correlated with the perceived softness of the prepared models.

It was previously shown that urinary Bcl-2 levels are reliably elevated during early and late stages of ovarian cancer. Our biosensor uses shear horizontal (SH) surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on surface functionalized ST-cut Quartz to quantify the mass loading change by protein adhesion to the delay path. SH-SAWs were generated and received by a pair of micro-fabricated interdigital transducers (IDTs) separated by a judiciously designed delay path. The delay path was surface-functionalized with monoclonal antibodies, ODMS, Protein A/G and Pluronic F127 for optimal Bcl-2 capture with minimal non-specific adsorption. Bcl-2 concentrations were quantified by the resulting resonance frequency shift detected by a custom designed resonator circuit.

Nano positioning is one of the most important factors in completion of nanotechnologies. It can be accomplished by flexure-based compliant stages driven by piezo-actuators. For compact configuration, the compliant stage is stacked by two-layered compliant mechanisms. The upper layer contains a motion guide mechanism, and the lower layer two displacement amplification mechanisms. The motion guide mechanism consists of four prismatic-prismatic parallel compliant joint chains for two translational motion guides. The displacement amplification mechanism is adopted by a flexure-based flextensional amplification mechanism driven by a stack-type piezo actuator. Due to the parallel compliant joint chains, the stage has the same dynamics in the x and y axes.

As nanoparticle dispersion and polymer electroactive phase content are some of the key factors for improving magnetoelectric coupling in the composites, the dispersion of ferrite nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix was studied by preparing samples by two alternative dispersion routes: ultrasound and citric acid nanoparticle surfactation. The nucleation of the electroactive beta-phase of the polymer was observed in composites produced by nanoparticle dispersion by ultrasound. This fact avoids the need of stretching composites at elevated temperature in order to obtain the electroactive phase and obtain magnetoelectric composites. By this method, nevertheless, large nanoparticle agglomerates are obtained. Nanoparticle dispersion is largely improved by citric acid surfactation of the nanoparticles.

Distinct plate displacement shape functions were defined for the regions underneath and outside the active electrodes. The plate shape functions were solved analytically using classic plate theory in conjunction with the external boundary conditions and the internal ones between the two regions in order to calculate the exact plate displacement under both external voltage stimulus and acoustic pressure. The model was used to study the effect of the electrode area on the overall plate deflection per unit input voltage such that the electromechanical coupling is optimized. While the center plate deflection increased monotonically with the electrode area for a simply supported plate, it followed a parabolic shape for a clamped one with a maximum deflection when the electrode radius covered 60% of the total plate radius. The simply supported plate exhibited four times the plate deflection capability of its clamped counterpart, when both are operating at their optimal electrode size. Both an experimental clamped bimorph aluminum nitride (AlN) pMUT, recently reported in the literature, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) were used to verify the developed model. The theoretical model predicted a static displacement per unit voltage of 10.9nm/V and a resonant frequency of 196.5kHz, which were in excellent agreement with the FEM results of 10.32nm/V and 198.5kHz, respectively.

The trap closes in a tenth of a second if a prey touches a trigger hair twice. The driving force of the closing process is most likely due to the elastic curvature energy stored and locked in the leaves, which is caused by a pressure differential between the upper and lower layers of the leaf. The trap strikes, holds and compresses the prey. We have developed new methods for measuring all these forces involved in the hunting cycle. We made precise calibration of the piezoelectric sensor and performed direct measurements of the average impact force of the trap closing using a high speed video camera for the determination of time constants. The new equation for the average impact force was derived. The impact average force between rims of two lobes in the Venus flytrap was found equal to 149 mN and the corresponding pressure between the rims was about 41 kPa. Direct measurements of the constriction force in the trap of Dionaea muscipula was performed during gelatin digestion. This force increases in the process of digestion from zero to 450 mN with maximal constriction pressure created by the lobes reaching to 9 kPa.

Alcian blue staining is widely used to visualize mucopolysaccharides and acidic mucins on both blotted membranes and SMME membranes; however, this method cannot be used to stain mucins with a low acidic glycan content.

{"title": "Nanoscale phase boundaries: a new twist to novel functionalities.", "abstract": "In functional materials, nanoscale phase boundaries exhibit exotic phenomena that are notably absent in their parent phases. Over the past two decades, much of the research into complex oxides (such as cuprate superconductors, CMR manganites and relaxor ferroelectrics) has demonstrated the key role that nanoscale inhomogeneities play in controlling the electronic and/or ionic structure of these materials. One of the key characteristics in such systems is the strong susceptibility to external perturbations, such as magnetic, electric and mechanical fields. A direct consequence of the accommodation of a large number of cationic substitutions in complex oxides is the emergence of a number of physical phenomena from essentially the same crystal framework. Recently, multiferroic behavior, which is characterized by the co-existence and potential coupling of multiple ferroic order parameters, has captured considerable worldwide research interest. The perovskite, BiFeO(3), exhibits robust ferroelectricity coupled with antiferromagnetism at room temperature. A rather unique feature of this material system is its ability to \"morph\" its ground state when an external mechanical constraint is imposed on it. A particularly striking example is observed when a large (~4 to 5%) compressive strain is imposed on a thin film through the epitaxial constraint from the underlying substrate. Under these conditions, the ground state rhombohedral phase transforms into a tetragonal-like (or a derivative thereof) phase with a rather large unit cell (c/a ratio of ~1.26). When the epitaxial constraint is partially relaxed by increasing the film thickness, this tetragonal-like phase evolves into a \"mixed-phase\" state, consisting of a nanoscale admixture of the rhombohedral-like phase embedded in the tetragonal-like phase. Such a system gives us a new pathway to explore a variety of mechanical, magnetic and transport phenomena in constrained dimensions. This article reviews our progress to date in this direction and also captures some possible areas of future research. We use the electromechanical response and the magnetic properties as examples to illustrate that its novel functionalities are intrinsically due to the phase boundaries and not the constituent phases. The possible origin of the giant piezoelectric response and enhanced magnetic moment across the boundaries is proposed based on the flexoelectric and flexomagnetic effects.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2012-09-06", "authors": ["J XZhang", "R JZeches", "QHe", "Y-HChu", "RRamesh"], "doi": "10.1039/c2nr31174g"}

{"title": "Uniaxially aligned nanofibrous cylinders by electrospinning.", "abstract": "Aligned nanofibers have drawn increasing interest for applications in biomedical engineering, electronics, and energy storage systems owing to the unique physicochemical properties provided by their anisotropy and high surface-to-volume ratio. Nevertheless, direct fabrication or assembly of aligned nanofibers into a 3-dimensional standalone construct with practically applicable dimensions presents an enormous challenge. We report a facile method to fabricate aligned nanofibrous cylinders, a widely used geometric form, by electrospinning aligned nanofibers across the gap between a pair of pin electrodes placed apart uniaxially. With this approach, cylindrical nanofibrous constructs of several millimeters in diameter and several centimeters in length can be readily produced. The versatility of the approach was demonstrated with several commonly used polymeric and ceramic materials, including polycaprolactone (PCL), chitosan/PCL, polyvinylidene fluoride, and titania. For a model application in tissue engineering, skeletal muscle cells were cultured on nanofibrous cylinders, which effectively produced highly aligned and densely populated myotubes along the nanofiber orientation, favorable for muscle tissue regeneration. With high structural integrity and stability, these can be directly integrated into devices or implanted in vivo as a standalone construct without the support of a substrate, thus increasing the portability, efficiency, and applicability of aligned nanofibers.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2012-09-06", "authors": ["SoumenJana", "AshleighCooper", "FumioOhuchi", "MiqinZhang"], "doi": "10.1021/am301803b"}

{"title": "Flexible electrode belt for EIT using nanofiber web dry electrodes.", "abstract": "Efficient connection of multiple electrodes to the body for impedance measurement and voltage monitoring applications is of critical importance to measurement quality and practicality. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) experiments have generally required a cumbersome procedure to attach the multiple electrodes needed in EIT. Once placed, these electrodes must then maintain good contact with the skin during measurements that may last several hours. There is usually also the need to manage the wires that run between the electrodes and the EIT system. These problems become more severe as the number of electrodes increases, and may limit the practicality and portability of this imaging method. There have been several trials describing human-electrode interfaces using configurations such as electrode belts, helmets or rings. In this paper, we describe an electrode belt we developed for long-term EIT monitoring of human lung ventilation. The belt included 16 embossed electrodes that were designed to make good contact with the skin. The electrodes were fabricated using an Ag-plated PVDF nanofiber web and metallic threads. A large contact area and padding were used behind each electrode to improve subject comfort and reduce contact impedances. The electrodes were incorporated, equally spaced, into an elasticated fabric belt. We tested the electrode belt in conjunction with the KHU Mark1 multi-frequency EIT system, and demonstrate time-difference images of phantoms and human subjects during normal breathing and running. We found that the Ag-plated PVDF nanofiber web electrodes were suitable for long-term measurement because of their flexibility and durability.

This study has applied oxygen plasma treatments and dopamine coating on the two polymers and investigated the changes of the surface properties and interactions with mammalian cells. All modification steps were verified by means of Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis and contact angle measurements. Surface topology of materials and biomolecules was studied by atomic force measurements (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Protein adsorption was quantified by fluorescent imaging and Bradford method. The results showed that O(2) plasma altered the surface hydrophilicity effectively on PSf and more than two folds of oxidation were obtained, when compared with the pristine one. The change of surface wettability was less significant on the O(2) plasma treated PVDF due to less oxidation extent, which was identified by analyzing the chemical compositions. The provided functionalized PVDF and PSf surfaces were tested with bovine serum albumin and L-929 mouse fibroblasts to evaluate the effects of surface modifications on protein adsorption and cell attachments. The biocompatibility was effectively promoted to fourfold and twofold on the hydrophobic PVDF and PSf by applying O(2) plasma treatments within short treatment time.

{"title": "Ultra-precise tracking control of piezoelectric actuators via a fuzzy hysteresis model.", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system based model is proposed for hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators. The antecedent and consequent structures of the fuzzy hysteresis model (FHM) can be, respectively, identified on-line through uniform partition approach and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. With respect to controller design, the inverse of FHM is used to develop a feedforward controller to cancel out the hysteresis effect. Then a hybrid controller is designed for high-performance tracking. It combines the feedforward controller with a proportional integral differential (PID) controller favourable for stabilization and disturbance compensation. To achieve nanometer-scale tracking precision, the enhanced adaptive hybrid controller is further developed. It uses real-time input and output data to update FHM, thus changing the feedforward controller to suit the on-site hysteresis character of the piezoelectric actuator. Finally, as to 3 cases of 50 Hz sinusoidal, multiple frequency sinusoidal and 50 Hz triangular trajectories tracking, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed controllers. Especially, being only 0.35% of the maximum desired displacement, the maximum error of 50 Hz sinusoidal tracking is greatly reduced to 5.8 nm, which clearly shows the ultra-precise nanometer-scale tracking performance of the developed adaptive hybrid controller.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2012-09-04", "authors": ["PengzhiLi", "FengYan", "ChuanGe", "MingchaoZhang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4748263"}

Regardless of feedwater DOC, moderate decrease in the total and hydraulically irreversible fouling was observed for a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membrane and a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration (UF) membrane after MIEX pretreatment, which was coincident with moderate removals of high molecular weight DOC in the feedwaters.

The differences in the structure of CNT layers were an important contributing factor for antifouling properties; scanning electron microscopy imaging showed that large diameter MWCNTs formed homogeneous porous layers across the membrane surface, while less effective, small diameter MWCNTs formed heterogeneous layers. Water quality analysis showed that CNT-membranes constructed with larger diameter CNTs were more effective at removing larger organic macromolecules responsible for fouling from feedwater compared to membranes made with smaller diameter CNTs. This reduced the concentration of foulants reaching the PVDF membrane and thus helped reduce membrane fouling.

We deposit a thin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer between the KNbO(3)-PDMS composite and the Au/Cr electrode to completely prevent dielectric breakdown during electrical poling and to significantly reduce leakage current during excessive straining. The flexible KNbO(3)-PDMS composite device shows a nearly frequency-independent dielectric constant (~3.2) and low dielectric loss (<0.006) for the frequency range of 10(2)-10(5) Hz. These results imply that short and randomly aligned ferroelectric nanorods can be used for a flexible high output nanogenerator as well as high-k capacitor applications by performing electrical poling and further optimizing the device structure.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2012-08-28", "authors": ["Jong HoonJung", "Chih-YenChen", "Byung KilYun", "NuriLee", "YushengZhou", "WilliamJo", "Li-JenChou", "Zhong LinWang"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/23/37/375401"}

The purpose of this study was to fabricate ZnO-doped poly(urethane) (PU) nanocomposite via one-step electrospinning technique. The utilized nanocomposite was prepared by using colloidal gel composed of ZnO and PU, and the obtained mats were vacuum dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The physicochemical characterization of as-spun composite nanofibers was carried out by X-ray diffraction pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and transmission electron microscopy, whereas the thermal behavior was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. The viability, attachment, and proliferation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells on the ZnO/PU composite nanofibers were analyzed by in vitro cell compatibility test. The morphological features of the cells attached on nanofibers were examined by Bio-SEM. We conclude that the electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds with unique spider nets had good biocompatibility.

{"title": "Detection limits of thin layer coulometry with ionophore based ion-selective membranes.", "abstract": "We report here on a significant improvement in lowering the low detection limit of thin layer coulometric sensors based on liquid ion-selective membranes, using a potassium-selective system as a model example. Various possible processes that may result in an elevated residual current reading after electrolysis were eliminated. Self-dissolution of AgCl on the Ag/AgCl inner element may result in a residual ion flux that could adversely affect the lower detection limit. It was here replaced with an Ag/AgI inner pseudoreference electrode where the self-dissolution equilibrium is largely suppressed. Possible residual currents originating from a direct contact between inner element and ion-selective membranes were eliminated by introducing an inert PVDF separator of 50 \u03bcm diameter that was coiled around the inner element by a custom-made instrument. Finally, the influence of electrolyte fluxes from the outer solution across the membrane into the sample was evaluated by altering its lipophilic nature and reducing its concentration. It was found that this last effect is most likely responsible for the observed residual current for the potassium-selective membranes studied here. For the optimized conditions, the calibration curves demonstrated a near zero intercept, thereby paving the way to the coulometric calibration-free sensing of ionic species. A linear calibration curve for the coulometric cell with valinomycin potassium-selective membrane was obtained in the range of 100 nM to 10 \u03bcM potassium in the presence of a 10 \u03bcM sodium background.

Here we present a 3D stabilization system based on an optoelectronic displacement sensor and custom piezo-actuators driven by a feedback control loop that constantly aims to zero the relative movement between the sensor and the target. We used simulations and prototyping to characterize the developed system. Our results show that 95% attenuation of movement artifacts is achieved at 1 Hz with stabilization performance declining to ca. 70% attenuation at 10 Hz. Stabilization bandwidth is limited by mechanical resonances within the displacement sensor that occur at relatively low frequencies, and are attributable to the sensor's high force sensitivity.

{"title": "Measurement of effective piezoelectric coefficients of PZT thin films for energy harvesting application with interdigitated electrodes.", "abstract": "Interdigitated electrode (IDE) systems with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films play an increasingly important role for two reasons: first, such a configuration generates higher voltages than parallel plate capacitor-type electrode (PPE) structures, and second, the application of an electric field leads to a compressive stress component in addition to the overall stress state, unlike a PPE structure, which results in tensile stress component. Because ceramics tend to crack at relatively moderate tensile stresses, this means that IDEs have a lower risk of cracking than PPEs. For these reasons, IDE systems are ideal for energy harvesting of vibration energy, and for actuators. Systematic investigations of PZT films with IDE systems have not yet been undertaken. In this work, we present results on the evaluation of the in-plane piezoelectric coefficients with IDE systems. Additionally, we also propose a simple and measurable figure of merit (FOM) to analyze and evaluate the relevant piezoelectric parameter for harvesting efficiency without the need to fabricate the energy harvesting device. Idealized effective coefficients e(IDE) and h(IDE) are derived, showing its composite nature with about one-third contribution of the transverse effect, and about two-thirds contribution of the longitudinal effect in the case of a PZT film deposited on a (100)-oriented silicon wafer with the in-plane electric field along one of the <011> Si directions. Randomly oriented 1-\u03bcm-thick PZT 53/47 film deposited by a sol-gel technique, was evaluated and yielded an effective coefficient e(IDE) of 15 C\u00b7m(-2). Our FOM is the product between effective e and h coefficient representing twice the electrical energy density stored in the piezoelectric film per unit strain deformation (both for IDE and PPE systems). Assuming homogeneous fields between the fingers, and neglecting the contribution from below the electrode fingers, the FOM for IDE structures with larger electrode gap is derived to be twice as large as for PPE structures, for PZT-5H properties.

{"title": "Construction and testing of coin cells of lithium ion batteries.", "abstract": "Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have wide applications in electronics, where customers always demand more capacity and longer lifetime. Lithium ion batteries have also been considered to be used in electric and hybrid vehicles or even electrical grid stabilization systems. All these applications simulate a dramatic increase in the research and development of battery materials, including new materials, doping, nanostructuring, coatings or surface modifications and novel binders. Consequently, an increasing number of physicists, chemists and materials scientists have recently ventured into this area. Coin cells are widely used in research laboratories to test new battery materials; even for the research and development that target large-scale and high-power applications, small coin cells are often used to test the capacities and rate capabilities of new materials in the initial stage. In 2010, we started a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored research project to investigate the surface adsorption and disordering in battery materials (grant no. DMR-1006515). In the initial stage of this project, we have struggled to learn the techniques of assembling and testing coin cells, which cannot be achieved without numerous help of other researchers in other universities (through frequent calls, email exchanges and two site visits). Thus, we feel that it is beneficial to document, by both text and video, a protocol of assembling and testing a coin cell, which will help other new researchers in this field. This effort represents the \"Broader Impact\" activities of our NSF project, and it will also help to educate and inspire students. In this video article, we document a protocol to assemble a CR2032 coin cell with a LiCoO2 working electrode, a Li counter electrode, and (the mostly commonly used) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. To ensure new learners to readily repeat the protocol, we keep the protocol as specific and explicit as we can. However, it is important to note that in specific research and development work, many parameters adopted here can be varied. First, one can make coin cells of different sizes and test the working electrode against a counter electrode other than Li. Second, the amounts of C black and binder added into the working electrodes are often varied to suit the particular purpose of research; for example, large amounts of C black or even inert powder were added to the working electrode to test the \"intrinsic\" performance of cathode materials. Third, better binders (other than PVDF) have also developed and used.

The aim of this study is to map the occurrence of cavitation around scaler tips under loaded conditions.\nTwo designs of piezoelectric ultrasonic scaling probes were evaluated with a scanning laser vibrometer and luminol dosimetric system under loaded (100 g/200 g) and unloaded conditions. Loads were applied to the probe tips via teeth mounted in a load-measuring apparatus.\nThere was a positive correlation between probe displacement amplitude and cavitation production for ultrasonic probes. The position of cavitation at the tip of each probe was greater under loaded conditions than unloaded and for the longer P probe towards the tip.\nWhilst increasing vibration displacement amplitude of ultrasonic scalers increases the occurrence of cavitation, factors such as the length of the probe influence the amount of cavitation activity generated. The application of load affects the production of cavitation at the most clinically relevant area-the tip.\nLoading and the design of ultrasonic scalers lead to maximising the occurrence of the cavitation at the tip and enhance the cleaning efficiency of the scaler.", "journal": "Clinical oral investigations", "date": "2012-08-16", "authors": ["A DamienWalmsley", "Simon CLea", "BernhardFelver", "David CKing", "Gareth JPrice"], "doi": "10.1007/s00784-012-0802-5"}

It was found that the ultrasonic amplitude decreased and fluctuated at the very early age, several hours after the beginning of fast hydration. The embedded transducers are very different from the surface coupled ones for they were directly influenced by the cement paste, such as the varying temperature and the boundary condition. Experiments were carried out to find out which factor result in such decrease and fluctuation. Test results showed that both the temperature and boundary conditions affect the ultrasonic measurement. When the hydration progressed under constant temperature, the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave decreased smoothly during certain period. When the hardened specimen was tested, it was found that the amplitude would decrease obviously with the increasing of temperature and vice versa.

{"title": "Ionic liquids as green solvents and electrolytes for robust chemical sensor development.", "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) exhibit complex behavior. Their simultaneous dual nature as solvents and electrolytes supports the existence of structurally tunable cations and anions, which could provide the basis of a novel sensing technology. However, the elucidation of the physiochemical properties of ILs and their connections with the interaction and redox mechanisms of the target analytes requires concerted data acquired from techniques including spectroscopic investigations, thermodynamic and solvation models, and molecular simulations. Our laboratory is using these techniques for the rational design and selection of ILs and their composites that could serve as the recognition elements in various sensing platforms. ILs show equal utility in both piezoelectric and electrochemical formats through functionalized ionics that provide orthogonal chemo- and regioselectivity. In this Account, we summarize recent developments in and applications of task-specific ILs and their surface immobilization on solid supports. Such materials can serve as a replacement for conventional recognition elements and electrolytic media in piezoelectric and electrochemical sensing approaches, and we place a special focus on our contributions to these fields. ILs take advantage of both the physical and chemical forces of interaction and can incorporate various gas analytes. Exploiting these features, we have designed piezoelectric sensors and sensor arrays for high-temperature applications. Vibrational spectroscopy of these ILs reveals that hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions are typically responsible for the observed sensing profiles, but the polarization and cavity formation effect as an analyte approaches the recognition matrix can also cause selective discrimination. IL piezoelectric sensors can have low sensitivity and reproducibility. To address these issues, we designed IL/conducting polymer host systems that tune existing molecular templates with highly selective structure specific interactions. We can also modulate the IL microenvironment so that ILs act as filler molecules to optimize host template cavity size, shape, and functionality. When used as non-volatile and tunable electrolytes, ILs show great potential for the development of both amperometric and electrochemical double layer capacitance sensors for the detection of oxygen and explosives. We also designed and tested a two dimensional electrode chip that enabled simultaneous monitoring of both piezoelectric and electrochemical signals. This device imparted additional selectivity and overcame the limitations of the typical sensing protocol. The integrated piezoelectric and electrochemical sensing approach allows the measure of the charge to mass ratio under a dynamic regime. The electrogravimetric dynamic relationship allows for further discrimination between and accurate quantification of the interfacial transfer of different species. In summary, although new systematic and mechanistic studies of ILs are needed, we show that the self-organized phases of the aggregated non-polar and charged domains of ILs are useful sensing materials for electrochemical and quartz crystal microbalance transducers.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2012-08-16", "authors": ["AbdulRehman", "XiangqunZeng"], "doi": "10.1021/ar200330v"}

Surgical difficulty was evaluated using a modified version of the Parant scale to categorize \"simple extractions\" and \"complex extractions\". Primary outcome parameters were the comparison of the postoperative pain evaluation rated on the Visual Analogue Scale from day 0 to day 6 postsurgery, and the assessment of differences in surgery time between the groups. Bone biopsies were taken during surgery to assess differences in bone tissue damage levels between the two different techniques.\nIn \"complex extractions\" lower pain evaluation and significantly shorter surgery times were recorded when rotatory instruments were used. In \"simple extractions\", similar surgery times were observed for both techniques, but pain was greatest on the day of surgery when the burr was used.

A conjunction of adsorbed mass from QCM with electric nature of bound protein from FET provided deeper understanding on a complex process of nonspecific protein adsorption and subsequent conformational changes at a solid/liquid interface. Lower apparent k(on) values obtained by FET than those obtained by QCM on hydrophobic surfaces are interpreted as preferred binding of protein molecules facing uncharged domains to the electrode surface, whereas higher k(off) values by FET than those by QCM imply active macromolecular rearrangements on the surfaces mainly driven by hydrophobic association in an aqueous medium.

After defining the subject of the doctoral thesis and choosing Henri Becqerel as thesis supervisor, Maria started intensive experimental work. In the allotted room called storeroom, in conditions that were far too inadequate, they managed to put up a unique measuring equipment composed of instruments whose originator was Pierre Curie. In the ionization chamber and in the piezoelectric quartz charges formed, whose mutual neutralization was shown by the quadrant electrometer. Ionization current, which was measured quantitatively, was proportional to the radiation of the sample. Studying many elements, their compounds and minerals enabled Maria to state that uranium is not the only element endowed with the power of radiation; the second one turned out to be thorium. Anomaly detected in the radiation of uranium minerals made it possible for Maria to draw an extremely important conclusion: radioactive uranium and thorium are not the only elements endowed with such an attribute. Pitchblende, which was studied by the Curie couple, had to contain also other radioactive substances. Gustave B\u00e9mont also participated in the chemical analysis of the uranium ore and it is worth reminding that he was involved in the discovery of polonium and uranium. The phenomenon of radioactivity couldn't have been explained if it was not for the sources of strong radioactivity. Those sources undoubtedly could have been the discovered elements but their scanty content in the uranium ore made their isolation very difficult and laborious. Access to industrial remains after procession of pitchblende from Jachymov (Sankt Joachimstahl), obtained owing to the mediation of Eduard Suess, provided the source of this raw material. From it, in a shack also called le hangar, the Curie couple isolated the first samples of the radium salt. This element, later extracted by discoverers on a grand scale and handed over in a various forms to researchers and institutions, became a foundation of physics and chemistry of radioactive elements.", "journal": "Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki : Kwartal'nyi zhurnal istorii nauki i tekhniki -", "date": "2012-08-02", "authors": ["ZbigniewWielog\u00f3rski"], "doi": null}

The use of display technologies, such as phage-display, allows for manageable selection and optimization of affinity reagents for use in biomarker detection. Here we review the use of recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFvs and Fabs, which can be affinity-selected from phage-display libraries, to bind with both high specificity and affinity to biomarkers of cancer, such as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We discuss how these recombinant antibodies can be fabricated into nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and quantum dots, for the purpose of enhancing detection of biomarkers at low concentrations (pg/mL) within complex mixtures such as serum or tissue extracts. Other sensing technologies, which take advantage of 'Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering' (gold nanoshells), frequency changes in piezoelectric crystals (quartz crystal microbalance), or electrical current generation and sensing during electrochemical reactions (electrochemical detection), can effectively provide multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer and injury biomarkers.

The most common way to compensate for this impedance increase is to employ electrical matching circuits at a high cost of fabrication complexity and effort. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer lateral-mode coupling method for phased-array construction. The direct comparison showed that the electrical impedance of a single-layer transducer driven in thickness mode is 1/(n\u00b2(1/(w/t))\u00b2) times that of an n-layer lateral mode transducer. A large reduction of the electrical impedance showed the impact and benefit of the lateral-mode coupling method.

Analysis of this model on L-T and L-L modes of sandwiched Terfenol-D/lead zirconate titanate/Terfenol-D composites can well reproduce the observed dc magnetic field (H(dc)) dependent magnetoelectric coefficients, which reach their maximum with the H(dc) all at about 500 Oe.

However, there are still some problems to be investigated, and some challenges to overcome. Acoustic backing is necessary to prevent SAWs excited in the surface of the silicon substrate from affecting the transmit pattern from the array. In addition, echoes resulting from bulk waves in the substrate must be removed. There is growing interest in integrating electronic circuits to do some of the beamforming directly below the transducer array. This may be easier to achieve for CMUTs than for traditional piezoelectric transducers. We will present simulations showing that the thickness of the silicon substrate and thicknesses and acoustic properties of the bonding material must be considered, especially when designing highfrequency transducers. Through simulations, we compare the acoustic properties of 3-D stacks bonded with three different bonding techniques; solid-liquid interdiffusion (SLID) bonding, direct fusion bonding, and anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACA). We look at a CMUT array with a center frequency of 30 MHz and three silicon wafers underneath, having a total silicon thickness of 100 \u03bcm.

Because a gastroscopic tube cannot accommodate the cables needed to connect all transducer elements directly to an imaging system, a major challenge is to locally reduce the number of channels, while maintaining a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. This can be achieved by using front-end receiver electronics bonded to the transducers to provide appropriate signal conditioning in the tip of the probe.

{"title": "Microfluidic acoustic trapping force and stiffness measurement using viscous drag effect.", "abstract": "It has recently been demonstrated that it was possible to individually trap 70\u03bcm droplets flowing within a 500\u03bcm wide microfluidic channel by a 24MHz single element piezo-composite focused transducer. In order to further develop this non-invasive approach as a microfluidic particle manipulation tool of high precision, the trapping force needs to be calibrated to a known force, i.e., viscous drag force arising from the fluid flow in the channel. However, few calibration studies based on fluid viscosity have been carried out with focused acoustic beams for moving objects in microfluidic environments. In this paper, the acoustic trapping force (F(trapping)) and the trap stiffness (or compliance k) are experimentally determined for a streaming droplet in a microfluidic channel. F(trapping) is calibrated to viscous drag force produced from syringe pumps. Chebyshev-windowed chirp coded excitation sequences sweeping the frequency range from 18MHz to 30MHz is utilized to drive the transducer, enabling the beam transmission through the channel/fluid interface for interrogating the droplets inside the channel. The minimum force (F(min,trapping)) required for initially immobilizing drifting droplets is determined as a function of pulse repetition frequency (PRF), duty factor (DTF), and input voltage amplitude (V(in)) to the transducer. At PRF=0.1kHz and DTF=30%, F(min,trapping) is increased from 2.2nN for V(in)=22V(pp) to 3.8nN for V(in)=54V(pp). With a fixed V(in)=54V(pp) and DTF=30%, F(min,trapping) can be varied from 3.8nN at PRF=0.1kHz to 6.7nN at PRF=0.5kHz. These findings indicate that both higher driving voltage and more frequent beam transmission yield stronger traps for holding droplets in motion. The stiffness k can be estimated through linear regression by measuring the trapping force (F(trapping)) corresponding to the displacement (x) of a droplet from the trap center. By plotting F(trapping) - x curves for certain values of V(in) (22/38/54V(pp)) at DTF=10% and PRF=0.1kHz, k is measured to be 0.09, 0.14, and 0.20nN/\u03bcm, respectively. With variable PRF from 0.1 to 0.5kHz at V(in)=54 V(pp), k is increased from 0.20 to 0.42nN/\u03bcm. It is shown that a higher PRF leads to a more compliant trap formation (or a stronger F(trapping)) for a given displacement x.

The equipment included a piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler with a newly developed metallic tip (NS group), a piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler with a conventional tip (CS group), a piezoelectric root planer ultrasonic scaler with a conventional tip (PR group), and a plastic hand curette (PH group). In addition, the sites treated using piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler systems were divided two sub-groups: 15 and 45 degrees. The treated titanium surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the average surface roughness (Ra) and mean roughness profile depth (Rz) were measured with a profilometer.\nSEM no significant changes in the titanium surfaces in the NS group, regardless of the angle of application. The PH group also showed no marked changes to the titanium surface, although some smoothening was observed. All CS and PR sites lost their original texture and showed irregular surfaces in SEM analysis. The profilometer analysis demonstrated that the roughness values (Ra and Rz) of the titanium surfaces increased in all, except the PH and NS groups, which showed roughness decreases relative to the untreated control group. The Ra value differed significantly between the NS and PR groups (P<0.05).\nThe results of this study indicated that changes in or damage to titanium surfaces might be more affected by the hardness of the scaler tip than by the application method. Within the limitations of this study, the newly developed metallic scaler tip might be especially suitable for peri-implant surface decontamination, due to its limited effects on the titanium surface.", "journal": "Journal of periodontal & implant science", "date": "2012-07-18", "authors": ["OtgonbayarUnursaikhan", "Jung-SeokLee", "Jae-KookCha", "Jung-ChulPark", "Ui-WonJung", "Chang-SungKim", "Kyoo-SungCho", "Seong-HoChoi"], "doi": "10.5051/jpis.2012.42.3.88"}

The electrical response of neuronal cells to applied voltages has been studied in detail, but less is known about their mechanical response to electrical excitations. Studies using atomic force microscopes (AFMs) have shown that mammalian cells exhibit voltage-induced mechanical deflections at nanometre scales, but AFM measurements can be invasive and difficult to multiplex. Here we show that mechanical deformations of neuronal cells in response to electrical excitations can be measured using piezoelectric PbZr(x)Ti(1-x)O(3) (PZT) nanoribbons, and we find that cells deflect by 1 nm when 120 mV is applied to the cell membrane. The measured cellular forces agree with a theoretical model in which depolarization caused by an applied voltage induces a change in membrane tension, which results in the cell altering its radius so that the pressure remains constant across the membrane. We also transfer arrays of PZT nanoribbons onto a silicone elastomer and measure mechanical deformations on a cow lung that mimics respiration.

{"title": "Piezo1: properties of a cation selective mechanical channel.", "abstract": "Piezo ion channels have been found to be essential for mechanical responses in cells. These channels were first shown to exist in Neuro2A cells, and the gene was identified by siRNAs that diminished the mechanical response. Piezo channels are approximately 2500 amino acids long, have between 24-32 transmembrane regions, and appear to assemble into tetramers and require no other proteins for activity. They have a reversal potential around 0 mV and show voltage dependent inactivation. The channel is constitutively active in liposomes, indicating that no cytoskeletal elements are required. Heterologous expression of the Piezo protein can create mechanical sensitivity in otherwise insensitive cells. \u00a0 Piezo1 currents in outside-out patches were blocked by the extracellular MSC inhibitor peptide GsMTx4. Both enantiomeric forms of GsMTx4 inhibited channel activity in a manner similar to endogenous mechanical channels. Piezo1 can adopt a tonic (non-inactivating) form with repeated stimulation. The transition to the non-inactivating form generally occurs in large groups of channels, indicating that the channels exist in domains, and once the domain is compromised, the members simultaneously adopt new properties. Piezo proteins are associated with physiological responses in cells, such as the reaction to noxious stimulus of Drosophila larvae. Recent work measuring cell crowding, shows that Piezo1 is essential for the removal of extra cells without apoptosis. Piezo1 mutations have also been linked to the pathological response of red blood cells in a genetic disease called Xerocytosis.

{"title": "High sensitivity fiber optic angular displacement sensor and its application for detection of ultrasound.", "abstract": "In this paper, we report on the development of an intensity-modulated fiber-optic sensor for angular displacement measurement. This sensor was designed to present high sensitivity, linear response, and wide bandwidth and, furthermore, to be simple and low cost. The sensor comprises two optical fibers, a positive lens, a reflective surface, an optical source, and a photodetector. A mathematical model was developed to determine and simulate the static characteristic curve of the sensor and to compare different sensor configurations regarding the core radii of the optical fibers. The simulation results showed that the sensor configurations tested are highly sensitive to small angle variation (in the range of microradians) with nonlinearity less than or equal to 1%. The normalized sensitivity ranges from (0.25\u00d7V(max)) to (2.40\u00d7V(max)) mV/\u03bcrad (where V(max) is the peak voltage of the static characteristic curve), and the linear range is from 194 to 1840 \u03bcrad. The unnormalized sensitivity for a reflective surface with reflectivity of 100% was measured as 7.7 mV/\u03bcrad. The simulations were compared with experimental results to validate the mathematical model and to define the most suitable configuration for ultrasonic detection. The sensor was tested on the characterization of a piezoelectric transducer and as part of a laser ultrasonics setup. The velocities of the longitudinal, shear, and surface waves were measured on aluminum samples as 6.43, 3.17, and 2.96 mm/\u03bcs, respectively, with an error smaller than 1.3%.

{"title": "Theoretical investigations of energy harvesting efficiency from structural vibrations using piezoelectric and electromagnetic oscillators.", "abstract": "Conversion of ambient vibrational energy into electric power has been the impetus of much modern research. The traditional analysis has focused on absolute electrical power output from the harvesting devices and efficiency defined as the convertibility of an infinite resource of vibration excitation into power. This perspective has limited extensibility when applying resonant harvesters to host resonant structures when the inertial influence of the harvester is more significant. Instead, this work pursues a fundamental understanding of the coupled dynamics of a main mass-spring-damper system to which an electromagnetic or piezoelectric mass-spring-damper is attached. The governing equations are derived, a metric of efficiency is presented, and analysis is undertaken. It is found that electromagnetic energy harvesting efficiency and maximum power output is limited by the strength of the coupling such that no split system resonances are induced for a given mass ratio. For piezoelectric harvesters, only the coupling strength and certain design requirements dictate maximum power and efficiency achievable. Since the harvesting circuitry must \"follow\" the split resonances as the piezoelectric harvesters become more massive, the optimum design of piezoelectric harvesters appears to be more involved than for electromagnetic devices.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2012-07-12", "authors": ["Ryan LHarne"], "doi": "10.1121/1.4725765"}

{"title": "Noncontact ultrasound imaging applied to cortical bone phantoms.", "abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to take the first steps toward applying noncontact ultrasound (NCU) to the tasks of monitoring osteoporosis and quantitative ultrasound imaging (QUS) of cortical bone. The authors also focused on the advantages of NCU, such as its lack of reliance on a technologist to apply transducers and a layer of acoustical coupling gel, the ability of the transducers to operate autonomously as specified by preprogrammed software, and the likely reduction in statistical and systematic errors associated with the variability in the pressure applied by the clinician to the transmitting transducer that NCU might provide. The authors also undertook this study in order to find additional applications of NCU beyond its past limited usage in assessing the severity of third degree burns.\nA noncontact ultrasound imaging system using a pair of specially designed broadband, 1.5 MHz noncontact piezoelectric transducers and cortical bone phantoms, were used to determine bone mineral density (BMD), speed of sound (SOS), integrated response (IR), and ultrasonic transmittance. Air gaps of greater than 3 cm, two transmission and two reflection paths, and a digital signal processor were also used in the collection of data from phantoms of nominal mass densities that varied from 1.17 to 2.25 g/cm(3) and in bone mineral density from 0 to 1.7 g/cm(3).\nGood correlations between known BMD and measured SOS, IR, and transmittance were obtained for all 17 phantoms, and methods for quantifying and minimizing sources of systematic errors were outlined. The BMD of the phantom sets extended through most of the in vivo range found in cortical bone. A total of 16-20 repeated measurements of the SOS, thickness, and IR for the phantom set that were conducted over a period of several months showed a small variation in the range of measurements of \u00b11%-2%. These NCU data were shown to be in agreement with similar results using contact ultrasound to be within 1%-2%. Transmittance images of cortical bone phantoms showed differences in the nominal overall BMD values of the phantoms that were large enough to be distinguished by a visual examination. A list of possible sources of errors in quantitative NCU was also included in this study.\nThe results of this paper suggest that NCU might find additional applications in medical imaging, beyond its original and only previous usage in assessing third degree burns. The fact that the authors' phantom measurements using conventional, gel coupled ultrasound are in agreement with those obtained with NCU demonstrates that in spite of large additional levels of attenuation of up to 150 dB and new error sources, NCU could have comparable levels of accuracy to those of conventional quantitative ultrasound, while providing the medical and patient comfort-related advantages of not involving direct contact.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2012-07-05", "authors": ["J BBulman", "K SGanezer", "P WHalcrow", "IanNeeson"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4709598\n10.1088/0031-9155/34/5/001\n10.1118/1.596769\n10.1118/1.2769102\n10.1118/1.597970\n10.1118/1.597590\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.1.111\n10.1118/1.598045\n10.1118/1.2977764\n10.1016/8756-3282(96)00086-5\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/012\n10.1088/0031-9155/36/10/003\n10.1359/jbmr.060617\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.09.008\n10.1063/1.3156332\n10.1007/BF00301939\n10.1121/1.1290245\n10.1016/j.ultras.2005.03.004\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2004.08.017\n10.1007/BF01623454\n10.1117/12.535571\n10.1088/0143-0815/11/3/007\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/012\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/013\n10.1016/8756-3282(96)00086-5\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/012\n10.1088/0031-9155/36/10/003\n10.1088/0031-9155/41/4/010\n10.1088/0031-9155/42/9/008\n10.1088/0031-9155/43/2/019\n10.1088/0031-9155/43/8/021\n10.1088/0031-9155/42/10/008\n10.1118/1.3181288\n10.1007/978-1-4419-8588-0\n10.1097/00004630-200021040-00008\n10.1086/502394\n10.1086/501729\n10.1007/s003300000438\n10.1007/s001980050081\n10.1007/s001980070120\n10.1002/ar.1091850102\n10.1385/JCD:8:4:436\n10.1007/s001980050154\n10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.12.2267\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.06.055\n10.1002/jor.1100060521\n10.1243/EMED_JOUR_1984_013_022_02\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.09.001\n10.1007/s00223-001-1092-0\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.11.1761"}

It avoids the complex and difficult mathematical procedure for constructing an inversion of the hysteresis model. For the purpose of validation, an experimental platform is established. To identify the model parameters, an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted. Based on the identified model parameters, a real-time feedforward controller is implemented for fast hysteresis compensation. Finally, tests are conducted with various kinds of trajectories.

Soluble egg antigens (SEA) of S. japonicum were then cross-linked to the quartz crystal using a special coupling agent.

The position of polarization flipping in one period on curves reflects the birefringence or material internal stress of the feedback cavity.

The intrinsic or externally-generated electric field within biomaterials may also contribute to their predominant mechanical properties. Mollusc shells are well known for their outstanding mechanical properties, which are generally believed to originate from their hierarchical structures in multi-levels. This paper is therefore focused on the studies of the hierarchical structures and electromechanical coupling behaviors of clamshell from micro- to nano-levels, and in particular, the biopolymer concentrated regions. Detailed studies are performed to characterize the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of clamshell. It was found that the piezoresponse of clamshell is originated from the biopolymers between the mineral grains, as well as those intercalated within the mineral crystalline structure after the biomineralization process. Local ferroelectric hysteresis loops of clamshell have also been observed and analyzed on the samples with different orientations, biopolymer contents, or moisture contents. It is believed that the overall functioning of the clamshell or even other mollusc shells may incorporate many mechanisms interacting together, rather than originate from the hierarchical structure alone.

As the output pressures increase, nonlinearity of CMUT must be reconsidered and optimization is required to reduce harmonic distortions. In this paper, we describe a design approach in which uncollapsed CMUT array elements are sized so as to operate at the maximum radiation impedance and have gap heights such that the generated electrostatic force can sustain a plate displacement with full swing at the given drive amplitude. The proposed design enables high output pressures and low harmonic distortions at the output. An equivalent circuit model of the array is used that accurately simulates the uncollapsed mode of operation. The model facilities the design of CMUT parameters for high-pressure output, without the intensive need for computationally involved FEM tools. The optimized design requires a relatively thick plate compared with a conventional CMUT plate. Thus, we used a silicon wafer as the CMUT plate. The fabrication process involves an anodic bonding process for bonding the silicon plate with the glass substrate. To eliminate the bias voltage, which may cause charging problems, the CMUT array is driven with large continuous wave signals at half of the resonant frequency. The fabricated arrays are tested in an oil tank by applying a 125-V peak 5-cycle burst sinusoidal signal at 1.44 MHz.

In the experimental measurements, the full-field optical technique known as electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is used to measure the transverse (out-of-plane) and planar (in-plane) resonant frequencies and corresponding mode shapes for piezoelectric bimorphs. In addition, in-plane resonant frequencies are obtained from impedance analysis and the response curves of the frequency spectra show different vibration characteristics of the piezoelectric bimorphs with different electrical connections. Piezoelectric bimorphs with normal connections have three-dimensional coupled vibration characteristics and the out-of-plane vibration dominates the motion. However, only in-plane vibration motions can be excited in the high-frequency range for abnormal connections, and the resonant characteristics are similar to the single-layered piezoelectric plate. The triple-layered piezoelectric bimorphs with abnormal connection are also analyzed using theoretical analysis. The resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and normalized displacements are calculated based on the analytical solution. The experimental results and the theoretical analysis are in good agreement with the numerical calculations using the finite element method. From the discussion of the results for the parallel- and series-type piezoelectric bimorphs with normal and abnormal connections, the vibration characteristics at high frequencies are completely analyzed in this study.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-06-22", "authors": ["Yu-HsiHuang", "Chien-ChingMa", "Ching-KongChao"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2312"}

Instead of measuring topographic changes caused by the SAW, the reported technique measures polarization in the piezoelectric substrate arising from mechanical stress caused by the SAW.

High-resolution imaging is presented with images of the interference arising from a metal reflector on a SAW device. A mathematical model combining SAW generation and force interactions between the probe and the substrate was used to verify the experimental data.

{"title": "Bi-ventricular pacing improves pump function only with adequate myocardial perfusion in canine hearts with pseudo-left bundle branch block.", "abstract": "Bi-ventricular (BiV) pacing is an effective therapy for the treatment of cardiac electromechanical (EM) dysfunction. The reason(s), however, for therapy non-response in approximately one-third of the subjects remains unclear, especially as it relates to myocardial perfusion and pacing location. In this study, we examined how acute BiV pacing response may be related to underlying myocardial perfusion coupled with pacing near or distant to the area of perfusion. In 10 open-chest anesthetized canines, coronary blood flow to the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall (AW: n = 5) and lateral wall (LW: n = 5) was controlled during four pacing conditions: right atrial, right ventricular (pseudo-left bundle branch block; [pseudo-LBBB]), BiV-LW and BiV-AW. Local EM function (piezo-electrical crystals and electrodes), along with global hemodynamic parameters, were measured during all pacing conditions at three coronary perfusion rates (\u22650.40 mL/min/g, 0.20-0.40 mL/min/g and <0.20 mL/min/g). A positive BiV therapy response was assessed by a significant increase in the maximum cardiac output compared with the pseudo-LBBB condition. Despite no improvement in QRS duration, BiV-LW pacing improved LV function compared with the pseudo-LBBB pacing condition (P value <0.01). This improvement with BiV-LW pacing was seen above a certain myocardial perfusion threshold and was independent of any increases in regional coronary blood flow with BiV pacing. At lower myocardial perfusion rates, LV function was not improved with BiV pacing at any location. This study underscores the significance of even mild ischemia on BiV pacing response.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2012-06-21", "authors": ["MarkSvendsen", "Frits WPrinzen", "Mithilesh KDas", "ZacharyBerwick", "MatthewRybka", "Johnathan DTune", "WilliamCombs", "Edward JBerbari", "Ghassan SKassab"], "doi": "10.1258/ebm.2012.012023"}

As the applied electric field exerts on the waveguide, the effective refractive index (RI) (or synchronous angle) can be effectively tuned from a selected mode to another adjacent mode owing to the high sensitivity and the small spacing of the ultra-high order modes. Subsequently, a correlation between EO and CPE coefficients is established. With this correlation and the measurement of the effective RI change to the applied voltage, the quadratic EO and CPE coefficients of PMN-PT ceramics are obtained simultaneously. The obtained results are further checked by fitting the variations of effective RI to a quadratic function.

To date, high-end medical imaging systems are able to efficiently implement real-time image formation techniques that can dramatically improve the diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound. Highly performing and thermally efficient ultrasound probes are then required to successfully enable the most advanced techniques. In this context, ultrasound transducer technology is the current limiting factor. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) are micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based devices that have been widely recognized as a valuable alternative to piezoelectric transducer technology in a variety of medical imaging applications. Wideband operation, good thermal efficiency, and low fabrication cost, especially for those applications requiring high-volume production of small-area dice, are strength factors that may justify the adoption of this MEMS technology in the medical ultrasound imaging field. This paper presents the design, development, fabrication, and characterization of a 12-MHz ultrasound probe for medical imaging, based on a CMUT array. The CMUT array is microfabricated and packed using a novel fabrication concept specifically conceived for imaging transducer arrays. The performance of the developed probe is optimized by including analog front-end reception electronics.

{"title": "Bending strength of piezoelectric ceramics and single crystals for multifunctional load-bearing applications.", "abstract": "The topic of multifunctional material systems using active or smart materials has recently gained attention in the research community. Multifunctional piezoelectric systems present the ability to combine multiple functions into a single active piezoelectric element, namely, combining sensing, actuation, or energy conversion ability with load-bearing capacity. Quantification of the bending strength of various piezoelectric materials is, therefore, critical in the development of load-bearing piezoelectric systems. Three-point bend tests are carried out on a variety of piezoelectric ceramics including soft monolithic piezoceramics (PZT-5A and PZT-5H), hard monolithic ceramics (PZT-4 and PZT-8), single-crystal piezoelectrics (PMN-PT and PMN-PZT), and commercially packaged composite devices (which contain active PZT-5A layers). A common 3-point bend test procedure is used throughout the experimental tests. The bending strengths of these materials are found using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to be 44.9 MPa for PMN-PZT, 60.6 MPa for PMN-PT, 114.8 MPa for PZT- 5H, 123.2 MPa for PZT-4, 127.5 MPa for PZT-8, 140.4 MPa for PZT-5A, and 186.6 MPa for the commercial composite. The high strength of the commercial configuration is a result of the composite structure that allows for shear stresses on the surfaces of the piezoelectric layers, whereas the low strength of the single-crystal materials is due to their unique crystal structure, which allows for rapid propagation of cracks initiating at flaw sites. The experimental bending strength results reported, which are linear estimates without nonlinear ferroelastic considerations, are intended for use in the design of multifunctional piezoelectric systems in which the active device is subjected to bending loads.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2012-06-20", "authors": ["Steven RAnton", "AlperErturk", "DanielInman"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2299"}

CPC sensing skins were developed by structuring a 3D carbon nanotubes network into three kinds of amorphous thermoplastic matrices (PMMA, aPS, PC). Adjustable parameters such as the thickness (number of sprayed layers) and the initial resistance of CPC transducers (CNT content relatively to percolation threshold) enabled to tailor both sensitivity and stability of the piezo-resistive responses, so that it was possible to monitor the strain evolution in the elastic domain and damage accumulation over this limit. Polymer matrices were selected after calculation of their \u03c7 Flory-Huggins parameters to evaluate their interactions with the PET substrate and solvent of dispersion, and after the comparison of their stress/strain characteristics, particularly their elastic limit. PC-1%CNT was found to be the best candidate satisfying both chemical and physical criteria. Finally, the exponential evolution of the piezo-resistive response of CPC sensing skins on a wide range of deformation (until breakage at \u03b5 = 27%), was well fitted with a model based on quantum tunnelling conduction inducing an exponential evolution of resistance with variations of CNT/CNT junction gap from 0.5 to 0.625 nm.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2012-06-19", "authors": ["ColinRobert", "Jean Fran\u00e7oisFeller", "Micka\u00eblCastro"], "doi": "10.1021/am300594t"}

Pristine MWCNTs accelerate crystallization of PVDF as an efficient nucleation agent, while the formed crystals are mainly nonpolar \u03b1 crystal form with few polar \u03b2 crystals. Incorporation of only ionic liquid results in depression of the PVDF melt crystallization rate due to the miscibility of IL with PVDF but leads to a higher content of polar crystals (\u03b2 and \u03b3 forms) than MWCNTs. The ionic liquid and MWCNTs show significant synergetic effects on both the nucleation and the formation of polar crystals for PVDF by melt crystallization. Addition of IL-MWCNTs not only improves the MWCNTs dispersion in PVDF matrix but also increases the overall crystallization rate of PVDF drastically. More important, the melt-crystallized PVDF nanocomposites with IL-MWCNTs show 100% polar polymorphs but no \u03b1 crystal forms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the achievements of full polar crystal form in the melt-crystallized PVDF without mechanical deformation or electric field. The IL to MWCNTs ratio and the IL-MWCNTs loading content effects on the crystallization behavior of PVDF in the nanocomposites were also studied. It is considered that the specific interactions between >CF2 with the planar cationic imidazolium ring wrapped on the MWCNTs surface lead to the full zigzag conformations of PVDF; thus, nucleation in polar crystals (\u03b2 and \u03b3 forms) lattice is achieved and full polar crystals are obtained by subsequent crystal growth from the nuclei.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The device is a metal-semiconductor-metal structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)-GaN-ITO. Under different straining conditions, the changing trend of the transport properties of GaN films can be divided into two types, corresponding to the different c-axis orientations of the films. An extreme value was observed for the integral EL intensity under certain applied strain due to the adjusted minority carrier injection efficiency by piezoelectric charges introduced at the M-S interface. The external quantum efficiency of the blue EL at 430 nm was changed by 5.84% under different straining conditions, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than the change of the green peak at 540 nm. The results indicate that the piezo-phototronic effect has a larger impact on the shallow acceptor states related EL process than on the one related to the deep acceptor states in p-type GaN films.

{"title": "UV epoxy bonding for enhanced SAW transmission and microscale acoustofluidic integration.", "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are appealing as a means to manipulate fluids within lab-on-a-chip systems. However, current acoustofluidic devices almost universally rely on elastomeric materials, especially PDMS, that are inherently ill-suited for conveyance of elastic energy due to their strong attenuation properties. Here, we explore the use of a low-viscosity UV epoxy resin for room temperature bonding of lithium niobate (LiNbO(3)), the most widely used anisotropic piezoelectric substrate used in the generation of SAWs, to standard micromachined superstrates such as Pyrex\u00ae and silicon. The bonding methodology is straightforward and allows for reliable production of sub-micron bonds that are capable of enduring the high surface strains and accelerations needed for conveyance of SAWs. Devices prepared with this approach display as much as two orders of magnitude, or 20 dB, improvement in SAW transmission compared to those fabricated using the standard PDMS elastomer. This enhancement enables a broad range of applications in acoustofluidics that are consistent with the low power requirements of portable battery-driven circuits and the development of genuinely portable lab-on-a-chip devices.

A new desorption methodology was developed since some pesticides were absorbed by the wall pore of the PVDF. Ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used for pesticide analysis. In order to obtain high recoveries and enrichment factors of the analytes, several parameters such as method of sealing, acceptor phase (organic solvents), stirring speed, extraction time, salting out effect, desorption mode and time were optimized. A fast, simple method for closing fibre ends was practiced by using mechanical crimping. Pesticides were extracted from the sample to the organic solvent and then desorbed in a mixture of methanol:water (1:1 v/v) prior to chromatographic analysis. Limits of detection (LOD) for the multi-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode of the method varies from 0.01 to 0.31 \u03bcg/kg with optimized sample preparation. Calibration curves are linear with R\u00b2 \u2265 0.991. Enrichment factor of the hollow fibre LPME ranges from 100 to 147. Matrix effect has been considered and is in the range of 76-122%. The relative recoveries from cucumber samples are between 63% and 119% with the relative standard deviation (RSD, n=6) lower than 20%.", "journal": "Journal of chromatography.

In this study, a hybrid desalination process comprising freeze desalination and membrane distillation (FD-MD) processes was developed and explored in an attempt to utilize the waste cold energy released from re-gasification of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The concept of this technology was demonstrated using indirect-contact freeze desalination (ICFD) and direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) configurations. By optimizing the ICFD operation parameters, namely, the usage of nucleate seeds, operation duration and feed concentration, high quality drinkable water with a low salinity \u223c0.144 g/L was produced in the ICFD process. At the same time, using the optimized hollow fiber module length and packing density in the DCMD process, ultra pure water with a low salinity of 0.062 g/L was attained at a condition of high energy efficiency (EE). Overall, by combining FD and MD processes and adopting the optimized operation parameters, the hybrid FD-MD system has been successfully demonstrated. A high total water recovery of 71.5% was achieved, and the water quality obtained met the standard for drinkable water. In addition, with results from specific energy calculation, it was proven that the hybrid process is an energy-saving process and utilization of LNG cold energy could greatly reduce the total energy consumption.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-06-12", "authors": ["PengWang", "Tai-ShungChung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2012.04.042"}

This motion can be described as the propagation of a wall across various types and strengths of pinning centers that collectively constitute a force profile or energetic landscape. Biased domain structures and asymmetric energy landscapes can be created through application of high fields (such as during electrical poling), and the material behavior in such states is often highly asymmetric. In some cases, this behavior can be considered as the electric analogue to the Bauschinger effect.

This paper presents a simple sensor system and related signal processing and pattern recognition methodologies to detect periods of food intake based on non-invasive monitoring of chewing. A piezoelectric strain gauge sensor was used to capture movement of the lower jaw from 20 volunteers during periods of quiet sitting, talking and food consumption. These signals were segmented into non-overlapping epochs of fixed length and processed to extract a set of 250 time and frequency domain features for each epoch. A forward feature selection procedure was implemented to choose the most relevant features, identifying from 4 to 11 features most critical for food intake detection. Support vector machine classifiers were trained to create food intake detection models. Twenty-fold cross-validation demonstrated per-epoch classification accuracy of 80.98% and a fine time resolution of 30 s. The simplicity of the chewing strain sensor may result in a less intrusive and simpler way to detect food intake.

{"title": "Further insight into the sound-producing mechanism of clownfishes: what structure is involved in sound radiation?", "abstract": "It was recently demonstrated that clownfishes produce aggressive sounds by snapping their jaw teeth. To date, only the onset of the sound has been studied, which raises the question, what structure is involved in sound radiation? Here, a combination of different approaches has been used to determine the anatomical structure(s) responsible for the size-related variations observed in sound duration and frequency. Filling the swimbladder with physiological liquid specifically modified size-related acoustic features by inducing a significant decrease in pulse duration of approximately 3 ms and a significant increase in dominant frequency of approximately 105 Hz. However, testing the acoustics of the swimbladder by striking it with a piezoelectric impact hammer showed that this structure is a highly damped sound source prevented from prolonged vibrations. In contrast, the resonant properties of the rib cage seems to account for the size-related variations observed in acoustic features. For an equivalent strike on the rib cage, the duration and dominant frequency of induced sounds changed with fish size: sound duration and dominant frequency were positively and negatively correlated with fish size, respectively. Such relationships between sonic features and fish size are consistent with those observed in natural sounds emitted by fish. Therefore, the swimbladder itself does not act as a resonator; its wall just seems to be driven by the oscillations of the rib cage. This set of observations suggests the need for reassessment of the acoustic role of swimbladders in various fish species.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2012-06-08", "authors": ["OrphalColleye", "MasaruNakamura", "BrunoFr\u00e9d\u00e9rich", "EricParmentier"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.067124"}

To evaluate it, we firstly measured silicone rubber samples with different softness. Then, it was applied to human forearm skin before and after tape-stripping. A VapoMeter and skin-surface hygrometer were used to confirm removal of the stratum corneum. A Cutometer was used to obtain conventional softness data for comparison.\nBoth the piezoelectric tactile sensor and the load cell could measure the softness of silicone rubber samples, but the piezoelectric tactile sensor was more sensitive than the load cell when the reaction force of the measured sample was under 100 mN in response to a 2-mm indentation. For human skin in vivo, transepidermal water loss and skin conductance were significantly changed after tape-stripping, confirming removal of the stratum corneum. The piezoelectric tactile sensor detected a significant change after tape-stripping, whereas the load cell did not. Thus, the piezoelectric tactile sensor can detect changes of mechanical properties at the skin surface. The load cell data were in agreement with Cutometer measurements, which showed no change in representative skin elasticity parameters after tape-stripping.

The exceptional metallic or semiconducting band gap is due to a combined effect of thickness-dependent inbuilt electric polarization and labile near-gap states unique in the polar nanofilms. The band gap and dipole moment of the nanofilms can be further significantly tuned by applying an in-plane strain.

Observations in previous studies of a related Trinidadian clothodid revealed that individuals shake and lunge their bodies in response to intruders of their silk domicile. We took the opportunity afforded by the discovery of the large clothodids to rear them in the laboratory and to investigate their communication behavior. We used piezoelectric film to detect substrate vibrations generated by adult females as elicited by a variety of intruders (an artificial stimulus, conspecific female or male, or a female of different species of webspinners). The residents produced three signals distinguishable by behavioral action, frequency (hertz), pulses per bout, and amplitude at peak frequency. We designated these as lift silk, shake, and snapback.

This is in contrast to the behavior observed for nucleation agents possessing either negative surface or neutral charges. Positive nucleation agents led to a remarkable increase in the crystallization temperature of PVDF (lower supercooling) as compared with that of neat PVDF. The dispersion of each type of nucleation agent is also important. The melting temperatures of nucleation agents need to be higher than the melting temperature of PVDF. The melting point and degree of crystallinity of PVDF can also be raised by using specific nucleation agents.

{"title": "Relaxation dynamics of poly(vinylidene fluoride) studied by dynamical mechanical measurements and dielectric spectroscopy.", "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the mobility of polymer chains in semicrystalline poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). PVDF crystallizes from the melt in the \u03b1 crystalline phase. The transformation from the \u03b1 phase to the electroactive \u03b2 phase can be induced by stretching at temperatures in the range between 80 and 140 \u00b0C. The spherulitic structure of the crystalline phase is deformed during stretching to form fibrils oriented in the direction of the strain. The amorphous phase confined among the crystalline lamellae is distorted as well and some degree of orientation of the polymer chains is expected. Dynamic-mechanical and dielectric spectroscopy measurements were performed in PVDF films stretched to strain ratios up to 5 at temperatures between 80 and 140 \u00b0C. Dynamic-mechanical measurements were conducted between -60 \u00b0C and melting and in this temperature range the relaxation spectra show the main relaxation of the amorphous phase (called \u03b2-relaxation) and at higher temperatures a relaxation related to crystallites motions (\u03b1 (c)-relaxation). Although the mean relaxation times of the \u03b2-relaxation are nearly equal in PVDF before and after crystal phase transformation, a significant change of shape of the relaxation spectrum proves the effect of chain distortion due to crystal reorganization. In stretched PVDF the elastic modulus of the polymer in the direction of deformation is significantly higher than in the transversal one, as expected by chain and crystals fibril orientation. The recovery of the deformation when the sample is heated is related with the appearance of the \u03b1 (c)-relaxation. Dielectric spectroscopy spectrum shows the main relaxation of the amorphous phase and a secondary process (\u03b3-relaxation) at lower temperatures.

The strain in the nanowires, introduced during growth, device fabrication and/or application, is an important issue for piezoelectric semiconductor (like CdS, ZnO, and CdTe) based photovoltaic. In this work, we demonstrate the first largely enhanced performance of n-CdS/p-Cu(2)S coaxial nanowire photovoltaic (PV) devices using the piezo-phototronics effect when the PV device is subjected to an external strain. Piezo-phototronics effect could control the electron-hole pair generation, transport, separation, and/or recombination, thus enhanced the performance of the PV devices by as high as 70%.

The method senses the local induction by measuring the deflection of the probe beam after it passes through a specimen area carrying a magnetic field. Little attention has been paid, however, to the fact that this technique is also capable of measuring electric fields. An application of the technique to measure piezoelectric polarization fields inside multi-layered structures such as quantum wells is demonstrated. For this purpose, piezoelectric fields within non-centrosymmetric crystal structures, based on GaN/InGaN/GaN quantum wells, are investigated. It can be shown that the technique is sensitive to these fields and yields detailed information about the field distribution. The specific information and experimental limitations as well as artefacts of the technique will be discussed in detail and first measurements are shown.

The magnitude of bone vibration in the facial bone during different types of voice production (resonant vs nonresonant vs strained voices) was also investigated.\nThirty-six healthy normal subjects produced three types of phonations: resonant voice, habitual nonresonant voice, and strained voice. A piezoelectric accelerometer was used to measure the vibrations in the nasal bridge and the perilaryngeal area during the phonation. Seventy-two selected nasal sounds (/ma/) produced under the resonant voice condition by these speakers were rated by two experienced speech pathologists on the magnitude of auditory-perceptual resonance using an 11-point equal-appearing interval scale. The magnitude of bone vibration was also compared across the three voice types.\nSignificant moderate correlations were found between the physical bone vibration and the auditory-perceptual rating of resonant voice at the nasal bridge of the facial bone (0.6). Resonant voice, compared with the strained and nonresonant voice types, was also found to have a significant increase in the magnitude of facial bone vibration. Nasal stimuli, compared with nonnasal stimuli, facilitated greater bone vibration during resonant voice production.\nPiezoelectric accelerometer, as an objective quantitative tool, measures reliably the extent of bone vibration in resonant voice phonation.

A set of sawing experiments, using a surgery Stryker micro-reciprocating saw and Kistler piezoelectric dynamometer, was carried out by a CNC machining center. Under different vibration frequencies of saw and feeding rates measured from orthognathic surgery, sawing forces were recorded by a signal acquisition system.\nRemarkably different sawing forces were measured from different cadavers. Feed and vibration frequency of the reciprocating saw could determine the cutting forces only on 1 body. To reduce the impact of bone thickness changes on the cutting force measurements, all the cutting force data should be converted to the force of unit cutting length. The vibration frequency of haptic feedback system is determined by main cutting forces. Fast Fourier transform method can be used to calculate the frequency of this system.

These numerical models, however, need a calibration step, because usually not all characteristics of the materials used are known. Characterization of material properties combined with numerical simulations and experimental data can be used to acquire valid estimates of the material parameters. In our design application, a finite element (FE) model of an ultrasonic particle separator, driven by an ultrasonic transducer in thickness mode, is required. A limited set of material parameters for the piezoelectric transducer were obtained from the manufacturer, thus preserving prior physical knowledge to a large extent. The remaining unknown parameters were estimated from impedance analysis with a simple experimental setup combined with a numerical optimization routine using 2-D and 3-D FE models. Thus, a full set of physically interpretable material parameters was obtained for our specific purpose. The approach provides adequate accuracy of the estimates of the material parameters, near 1%. These parameter estimates will subsequently be applied in future design simulations, without the need to go through an entire series of characterization experiments. Finally, a sensitivity study showed that small variations of 1% in the main parameters caused changes near 1% in the eigenfrequency, but changes up to 7% in the admittance peak, thus influencing the efficiency of the system.

In this paper we study the present state of the art for these materials, indicate their principal point and extended defects, and present methods to reduce the dislocation density. Large concentrations of intrinsic point defects often exist in crystal grown at very high temperatures. The point defects (intrinsic or related to impurities) modify the constants and can increase the acoustic losses. This is the case for the alkali ions and the OH that induce severe losses in different temperature intervals. The extended defects also affect the performances of the piezoelectric devices. Some, such as twins, ferroelectric domains, or large solid or liquid inclusions, have very detrimental effects. Dislocations, growth bands, and planar defects are more difficult to avoid and affect the devices in a more subtle manner. In quartz and its analogs, dislocations seem to increase the nonlinear elastic effects and have a collective effect on the vibration modes, particularly in energy trapping resonators.

The bimorph PMUT consisted of two piezoelectric layers of the same material, having equal thicknesses, and sandwiched between three thin electrodes. The piezoelectric layers, having the same poling axis, were biased with electric potentials of the same magnitude but opposite polarity. The strain mismatches between the two layers created by the converse piezoelectric effect caused the membrane to vibrate and, hence, transmit a pressure wave. Upon receiving the echo of the acoustic wave, the membrane deformation led to the generation of electric charges as a result of the direct piezoelectric phenomenon. The membrane angular velocity and electric current were related to the applied electric field, the impinging acoustic pressure, and the moment at the edge of the membrane using two canonical equations. The transduction coefficients from the electrical to the mechanical domain and vice-versa were shown to be bilateral and the system was shown to be reversible. The circuit parameters of the derived model were extracted, including the transformer ratio, the clamped electric impedance, the spring-softening impedance, and the open-circuit mechanical impedance.

Both isomers show remarkable AIE effect (\u03b1(AIE) \u2265 322) and high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state (\u03a6(F) 100%). The conformers readily undergo E/Z isomerization upon exposure to a powerful UV light and treatment at a high temperature (>200 \u00b0C).

Released films show a dramatic change in the global dielectric nonlinearity and its frequency dependence as a function of mechanical clamping. Furthermore, we observe a transition from strong clustering of the nonlinear response for the clamped case to almost uniform nonlinearity for the released film. This behavior is ascribed to increased mobility of domain walls. These results suggest the dominant role of collective strain interactions mediated by the local and global mechanical boundary conditions on the domain wall dynamics.

EC materials are able to reversibly change their light absorption properties in a certain wavelength range via redox reactions stimulated by low direct current (dc) potentials of the order of a fraction of volts to a few volts. The redox switching may result in a change in color of the EC materials owing to the generation of new or changes in absorption band in visible region, infrared or even microwave region. In ECDs the electrochromic layers need to be incorporated with supportive components such as electrical contacts and ion conducting electrolytes.

A series of target inorganic-organic hybrid compounds of the general formula [NH(2)(C(2)H(4))(2)O](2)MX(5) (where M = Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Br) has been synthesized by incorporating the organic component (morpholine) into the highly polarizable one-dimensional halogenoantimonate(III)/halogenobismuthate(III) chain network. Among the studied compounds, four were found to crystallize in the room temperature phase in the piezoelectric, orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), Z = 4, the feature being confirmed by the powder second harmonic generation of light and piezoelectric measurements. Dielectric dispersion studies between 200 Hz and 2 MHz disclosed a relaxation process below room temperature well described by the Cole-Cole equation.

{"title": "Spotiton: a prototype for an integrated inkjet dispense and vitrification system for cryo-TEM.", "abstract": "Over the last three decades, Cryo-TEM has developed into a powerful technique for high-resolution imaging of biological macromolecules in their native vitrified state. However, the method for vitrifying specimens onto EM grids is essentially unchanged - application of \u223c3 \u03bcL sample to a grid, followed by blotting and rapid plunge freezing into liquid ethane. Several trials are often required to obtain suitable thin (few hundred nanometers or less) vitrified layers amenable for cryo-TEM imaging, which results in waste of precious sample and resources. While commercially available instruments provide some level of automation to control the vitrification process in an effort to increase quality and reproducibility, obtaining satisfactory vitrified specimens remains a bottleneck in the Cryo-TEM pipeline. We describe here a completely novel method for EM specimen preparation based on small volume (picoliter to nanoliter) dispensing using inkjet technology. A first prototype system (Spotiton v0.5) demonstrates feasibility of this new approach for specimen vitrification. A piezo-electric inkjet dispenser is integrated with optical real-time cameras (100 Hz frame rate) to analyze picoliter to nanoliter droplet profiles in-flight and spreading dynamics on the grid, and thus provides a method to optimize timing of the process. Using TEM imaging and biochemical assays we demonstrate that the piezo-electric inkjet mechanism does not disrupt the structural or functional integrity of macromolecules. These preliminary studies provide insight into the factors and components that will need further development to enable a robust and repeatable technique for specimen vitrification using this novel approach.", "journal": "Journal of structural biology", "date": "2012-05-10", "authors": ["TilakJain", "PatrickSheehan", "JohnCrum", "BridgetCarragher", "Clinton SPotter"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsb.2012.04.020"}

Nitrotyrosine was quantitated in rabbit bladder muscle and mucosa using two analytical systems: Western blotting analyses and a 96-well plate quantitative analysis kit. Materials and Methods. Rabbit bladder muscle and mucosa were obtained from control rabbits. For the Western analysis, the samples were loaded into a SDS page gel and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The optical density was measured using a Kodak Scanner. Using the 96-well plate, the samples and standards were loaded, incubated with primary and secondary antibody, washed and vacuumed with 10x wash buffer three times between each incubation period. Stop buffer was added to the plate and the results were quantified via the plate reader. Results. For both muscle and mucosa tissue, the optical density readings were linear with tissue concentration; the concentration of nitrotyrosine in the mucosa was significantly higher than in the muscle. However, whereas the Western blot analysis is based on relative optical densities, the 96-well plate kit provides a truly quantitative analysis. Discussion. Mucosa tissue displayed a higher density of nitrotyrosine than did detrusor muscle tissue. This may well be due to the significantly higher metabolic activity of the mucosa compared to the muscle.", "journal": "ISRN urology", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["BrittanyFitzpatrick", "CatherineSchuler", "Robert ELeggett", "Robert MLevin"], "doi": "10.5402/2012/618247"}

Temperature- and excitation power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements are performed on three groups of sample, including 1) the samples with both effects of thermal annealing and increased p-type thickness, 2) those only with the similar thermal annealing process, and 3) those with increased overgrowth thickness and minimized thermal annealing effect. From the comparisons of emission wavelength, internal quantum efficiency (IQE), spectral shift with increasing PL excitation level, and calibrated activation energy of carrier localization between various samples in the three groups, one can clearly see the individual effects of thermal annealing and increased p-type layer thickness. The counteraction leads to increased IQE and blue-shifted emission spectrum with increasing p-type thickness when the thickness is below a certain value (20-nm p-AlGaN plus 60-nm p-GaN under our growth conditions). Beyond this thickness, the IQE value decreases and the emission spectrum red shifts with increasing p-type thickness.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2012-05-09", "authors": ["Chih-YenChen", "ChiehHsieh", "Che-HaoLiao", "Wei-LunChung", "Hao-TsungChen", "WenyuCao", "Wen-MingChang", "Horng-ShyangChen", "Yu-FengYao", "Shao-YingTing", "Yean-WoeiKiang", "Chih-Chung C CYang", "XiaodongHu"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.20.011321"}

{"title": "Oxy-acetylene driven laboratory scale shock tubes for studying blast wave effects.", "abstract": "This paper describes the development and characterization of modular, oxy-acetylene driven laboratory scale shock tubes. Such tools are needed to produce realistic blast waves in a laboratory setting. The pressure-time profiles measured at 1 MHz using high-speed piezoelectric pressure sensors have relevant durations and show a true shock front and exponential decay characteristic of free-field blast waves. Descriptions are included for shock tube diameters of 27-79 mm. A range of peak pressures from 204 kPa to 1187 kPa (with 0.5-5.6% standard error of the mean) were produced by selection of the driver section diameter and distance from the shock tube opening. The peak pressures varied predictably with distance from the shock tube opening while maintaining both a true blast wave profile and relevant pulse duration for distances up to about one diameter from the shock tube opening. This shock tube design provides a more realistic blast profile than current compression-driven shock tubes, and it does not have a large jet effect. In addition, operation does not require specialized personnel or facilities like most blast-driven shock tubes, which reduces operating costs and effort and permits greater throughput and accessibility. It is expected to be useful in assessing the response of various sensors to shock wave loading; assessing the reflection, transmission, and absorption properties of candidate armor materials; assessing material properties at high rates of loading; assessing the response of biological materials to shock wave exposure; and providing a means to validate numerical models of the interaction of shock waves with structures.

{"title": "Design and control of a decoupled two degree of freedom translational parallel micro-positioning stage.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel decoupled two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) translational parallel micro-positioning stage. The stage consists of a monolithic compliant mechanism driven by two piezoelectric actuators. The end-effector of the stage is connected to the base by four independent kinematic limbs. Two types of compound flexure module are serially connected to provide 2-DOF for each limb. The compound flexure modules and mirror symmetric distribution of the four limbs significantly reduce the input and output cross couplings and the parasitic motions. Based on the stiffness matrix method, static and dynamic models are constructed and optimal design is performed under certain constraints. The finite element analysis results are then given to validate the design model and a prototype of the XY stage is fabricated for performance tests. Open-loop tests show that maximum static and dynamic cross couplings between the two linear motions are below 0.5% and -45 dB, which are low enough to utilize the single-input-single-out control strategies. Finally, according to the identified dynamic model, an inversion-based feedforward controller in conjunction with a proportional-integral-derivative controller is applied to compensate for the nonlinearities and uncertainties. The experimental results show that good positioning and tracking performances are achieved, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and controller design. The resonant frequencies of the loaded stage at 2 kg and 5 kg are 105 Hz and 68 Hz, respectively.

For the experimental measurements, amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry (AF-ESPI) is used to obtain resonant frequencies and radial, lateral, and angular mode shapes. This optical technique utilizes a real-time, full-field, non-contact optical system that measures both the natural frequency and corresponding vibration mode shape simultaneously. The second experimental technique used, laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), is a pointwise displacement measurement method that determines the resonant frequencies of the piezoelectric shell.

Excellent agreement between the experimental and numerical results is found for the three-dimensional coupled vibrational characteristics of the piezoelectric shell.

{"title": "Secretome analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae using in vitro systems.", "abstract": "Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating blast fungal pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that causes dramatic decreases in seed yield and quality. During the early stages of infection by this pathogen, the fungal spore senses the rice leaf surface, germinates, and penetrates the cell via an infectious structure known as an appressorium. During this process, M. oryzae secretes several proteins; however, these proteins are largely unknown mainly due to the lack of a suitable method for isolating secreted proteins during germination and appressoria formation. We examined the secretome of M. oryzae by mimicking the early stages of infection in vitro using a glass plate (GP), PVDF membrane, and liquid culture medium (LCM). Microscopic observation of M. oryzae growth revealed appressorium formation on the GP and PVDF membrane resembling natural M. oryzae-rice interactions; however, appresorium formation was not observed in the LCM. Secreted proteins were collected from the GP (3, 8, and 24 h), PVDF membrane (24 h), and LCM (48 h) and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The GP, PVDF membrane, and LCM-derived 2D gels showed distinct protein patterns, indicating that they are complementary approaches. Collectively, 53 nonredundant proteins including previously known and novel secreted proteins were identified. Six biological functions were assigned to the proteins, with the predominant functional classes being cell wall modification, reactive oxygen species detoxification, lipid modification, metabolism, and protein modification. The in vitro system using GPs and PVDF membranes applied in this study to survey the M. oryzae secretome, can be used to further our understanding of the early interactions between M. oryzae and rice leaves.", "journal": "Proteomics", "date": "2012-04-28", "authors": ["Young-HoJung", "Seung-HeeJeong", "So HeeKim", "RakshaSingh", "Jae-eunLee", "Yoon-SeongCho", "Ganesh KumarAgrawal", "RandeepRakwal", "Nam-SooJwa"], "doi": "10.1002/pmic.201100142"}

The current-voltage characteristics of the devices were studied using conductive atomic force microscopy, and the results show that the current flowing through the ZnO NWs can be tuned/gated by the mechanical force applied to the NWs. This phenomenon was attributed to the piezoelectric tuning of the Schottky barrier at the Au-ZnO junction, known as the piezotronic effect. Our study demonstrates the possibility of using Au droplet capped ZnO NWs as a transistor array for mapping local strain. More importantly, our design gives the possibility of fabricating an array of transistors using individual vertical nanowires that can be controlled independently by applying mechanical force/pressure over the top.

In this work, the concept of a polyelectrolyte-promoted forward osmosis-membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system was demonstrated and applied to recycle the wastewater containing an acid dye. A poly(acrylic acid) sodium (PAA-Na) salt was used as the draw solute of the FO to dehydrate the wastewater, while the MD was employed to reconcentrate the PAA-Na draw solution. With the integration of these two processes, a continuous wastewater treatment process was established. To optimize the FO-MD hybrid process, the effects of PAA-Na concentration, experimental duration, and temperature were investigated. Almost a complete rejection of PAA-Na solute was observed by both FO and MD membranes. Under the conditions of 0.48 g mL(-1) PAA-Na and 66 \u00b0C, the wastewater was most efficiently dehydrated yet with a stabilized PAA-Na concentration around 0.48 g mL(-1). The practicality of PAA-Na-promoted FO-MD hybrid technology demonstrates not only its suitability in wastewater reclamation, but also its potential in other membrane-based separations, such as protein or pharmaceutical product enrichment.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of multiple growth factors [epidermal growth factor (EGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] on human oocyte maturation, early embryo development, blastocyst formation and ESC line generation.\nPatients (n= 344) undergoing IVF owing to male factor infertility were enrolled in this study. Metaphase II oocytes were separated into four grades based on their morphology. Spindle assembly from IVM oocytes with or without growth factor treatment was assessed by immunostaining. Piezo-assisted micromanipulation technology was used to produce fertilized (ICSI) and cloned [(somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)] embryos. Embryos received four different growth factor treatments; embryo development rates from pronuclear to blastocyst stage and embryo grading (for quality) at the 8-cell stage were analyzed. The presence of receptors on human cumulus cells and IVM oocytes was assessed by immunofluorescence. The blastocysts generated from fertilized and cloned embryos were used for ESC derivation.\nThe combination of EGF, BDNF and IGF-1 can effectively increase oocyte maturation rate in vitro, and significantly improve the oocyte quality in terms of morphology and normal spindle levels (P< 0.05). Also, the developmental competence of fertilized oocytes to 8-cell and blastocyst stages was improved by the addition of growth factors (P< 0.05). However, there were no significant differences among the four groups in 8-cell grading. Blastocyst formation in cloned embryos cultured with the three growth factors was higher than the control group (23.1 versus 4.3%, P< 0.05). Receptors for the three growth factors were present in cumulus cells and IVM oocytes, and four human ESC lines were derived from fertilized blastocysts but none from cloned blastocysts.\nThis study demonstrated that EGF, BDNF and IGF-1 can improve oocyte maturation rate and quality in vitro, and consequently increase early embryo development and blastocyst formation, which is very beneficial in improving the reprogramming efficiency of SCNT.

This is rather well understood in bulk multiferroics, but it is not known whether the magnetoelectric coupling properties are retained at nanometre length scales in nanostructured multiferroics. The main challenges are related to measurement difficulties of the coupling at nanoscale, as well as the fabrication of suitable nano-multiferroic samples. Addressing these issues is an important prerequisite for the implementation of multiferroics in future nanoscale devices and sensors. In this paper we report on the local measurement of the magnetoelectric coefficient in bilayered ceramic nanocomposites from the variation in the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of the electrostrictive layer in the presence of a magnetic field. The experimental data were analyzed using a theoretical relationship linking the piezoelectric coefficient to the magneto-electric coupling coefficient. Our results confirm the presence of a measurable magnetoelectric coupling in bilayered nanocomposites constructed by a perovskite as the electrostrictive phase and two different ferrites (cubic spinel and hexagonal) as the magnetic phases.

The early prototypes of the 20 and 100kHz applicators were optimized using the maximum electrical power transfer theorem, which required a punctilious analysis of the complex impedance of the piezoelectric disks mounted in appropriately shaped metal housings. In the implementation tested, the optimized ultrasound transducer applicators were driven by portable, customized electronics, which controlled the excitation voltage amplitude and facilitated operation in continuous wave (CW) or pulsed mode with adjustable (10-90%) duty cycle. The driver unit was powered by remotely located rechargeable lithium (Li) polymer batteries. This was done to further minimize the weight of the applicator unit making it wearable. With DC voltage of approximately 15V the prototypes were capable of delivering pressure amplitudes of about 55kPa or 100mW/cm(2) (I(SPTP)). This level of acoustic output was chosen as it is considered safe and side effects free, even at prolonged exposure.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-04-20", "authors": ["YouhanSunny", "Christopher RBawiec", "An TNguyen", "Joshua ASamuels", "Michael SWeingarten", "Leonid AZubkov", "Peter ALewin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.03.004"}
{"title": "Concentration of metabolites from low-density planktonic communities for environmental metabolomics using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.", "abstract": "Environmental metabolomics is an emerging field that is promoting new understanding in how organisms respond to and interact with the environment and each other at the biochemical level. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of several technologies, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with considerable promise for such studies. Advantages of NMR are that it is suitable for untargeted analyses, provides structural information and spectra can be queried in quantitative and statistical manners against recently available databases of individual metabolite spectra. In addition, NMR spectral data can be combined with data from other omics levels (e.g. transcriptomics, genomics) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological responses of taxa to each other and the environment. However, NMR is less sensitive than other metabolomic techniques, making it difficult to apply to natural microbial systems where sample populations can be low-density and metabolite concentrations low compared to metabolites from well-defined and readily extractable sources such as whole tissues, biofluids or cell-cultures. Consequently, the few direct environmental metabolomic studies of microbes performed to date have been limited to culture-based or easily defined high-density ecosystems such as host-symbiont systems, constructed co-cultures or manipulations of the gut environment where stable isotope labeling can be additionally used to enhance NMR signals. Methods that facilitate the concentration and collection of environmental metabolites at concentrations suitable for NMR are lacking. Since recent attention has been given to the environmental metabolomics of organisms within the aquatic environment, where much of the energy and material flow is mediated by the planktonic community, we have developed a method for the concentration and extraction of whole-community metabolites from planktonic microbial systems by filtration. Commercially available hydrophilic poly-1,1-difluoroethene (PVDF) filters are specially treated to completely remove extractables, which can otherwise appear as contaminants in subsequent analyses. These treated filters are then used to filter environmental or experimental samples of interest. Filters containing the wet sample material are lyophilized and aqueous-soluble metabolites are extracted directly for conventional NMR spectroscopy using a standardized potassium phosphate extraction buffer. Data derived from these methods can be analyzed statistically to identify meaningful patterns, or integrated with other omics levels for comprehensive understanding of community and ecosystem function.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-04-18", "authors": ["R CraigEverroad", "SeijiYoshida", "YuuriTsuboi", "YasuhiroDate", "JunKikuchi", "ShigeharuMoriya"], "doi": "10.3791/3163"}

PSSLEDs show higher light output power and smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) of EL than those of C-LEDs for their better crystalline quality. The FWHM of EL for PSSLEDs exhibits faster broadening as current increases than C-LEDs, while the same broadening of FWHM of PL as excitation power increases is shown in PSSLEDs and C-LEDs, which indicate that there is stronger band filling effect in PSSLEDs caused by relatively higher carrier density in their QWs at the same current injection level. Besides, smaller blue-shift of peak wavelength of EL as injection current increases in PSSLEDs suggests that piezoelectric field in PSSLEDs is weaker than that in C-LEDs.

The total scanning time is reduced by 29% of the two proposed fast scan modes. It will offer a better solution for high speed scanning without sacrificing the system stability, and will not introduce additional difficulties to the configuration of scanning measurement systems. They can be easily applied to the mechanical scanning measuring systems with different driving actuators such as piezoelectric, linear motor, dc motor, and so on. The proposed fast raster and square spiral scan modes are realized in SAM, but not specially designed for it. Therefore, they have universal adaptability and can be applied to other scanning measurement systems with two-dimensional mechanical scanning stages, such as atomic force microscope or scanning tunneling microscope.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2012-04-03", "authors": ["Bing-FengJu", "XiaolongBai", "JianChen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3697863"}
{"title": "Comparison of electrostatic fins with piezoelectric impact hammer techniques to extend impulse calibration range of a torsional thrust stand.", "abstract": "With the progression of high-power electric propulsion and high thrust-to-power propulsions system, thrust stand diagnostics require high-fidelity calibration systems that are accurate over a large-range of thrust levels. Multi-mode and variable I(sp) propulsion devices also require that a single stand be capable of measuring thrust from 10's of uNs to 100's of mNs. While the torsional thrust stand mechanic and diagnostics are capable of operating over such a large range, current pulsed calibration schemes are typically limited to a few orders of magnitude of dynamic range. In order to develop a stand with enough dynamic range, two separate calibration methods have been examined and compared to create a combined system. Electrostatic fin (ESF) and piezoelectric impact hammer (PIH) calibration systems were simultaneously tested on a large scale torsional thrust stand system. The use of the these two methods allowed the stand to be calibrated over four orders of magnitude, from 0.01 mNs to 750 mNs. The ESF system produced linear results within 0.52% from 0.01 mNs to 20 mNs, while the PIH system extended this calibration range from 10 mNs to 750 mNs with an error of 0.99%. The two calibration methods agreed within 4.51% over their overlapping range of 10-20 mNs.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2012-04-03", "authors": ["Anthony PPancotti", "MatthewGilpin", "Martin SHilario"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3690385"}

{"title": "Stabilizing nanometer scale tip-to-substrate gaps in scanning electrochemical microscopy using an isothermal chamber for thermal drift suppression.", "abstract": "The control of a nanometer-wide gap between tip and substrate is critical for nanoscale applications of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Here, we demonstrate that the stability of the nanogap in ambient conditions is significantly compromised by the thermal expansion and contraction of components of an SECM stage upon a temperature change and can be dramatically improved by suppressing the thermal drift in a newly developed isothermal chamber. Air temperature in the chamber changes only at ~.2 mK/min to remarkably and reproducibly slow down the drift of tip-substrate distance to ~0.4 nm/min in contrast to 5-150 nm/min without the chamber. Eventually, the stability of the nanogap in the chamber is limited by its fluctuation with a standard deviation of \u00b10.9 nm, which is mainly ascribed to the instability of a piezoelectric positioner. The subnanometer scale drift and fluctuation are measured by forming a ~20 nm-wide gap under the 12 nm-radius nanopipet tip based on ion transfer at the liquid/liquid interface. The isothermal chamber is useful for SECM and, potentially, for other scanning probe microscopes, where thermal-drift errors in vertical and lateral probe positioning are unavoidable by the feedback-control of the probe-substrate distance.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2012-04-03", "authors": ["JiyeonKim", "MeiShen", "NikolozNioradze", "ShigeruAmemiya"], "doi": "10.1021/ac300564g"}

The aim of this study was to establish the differences between two ultrasonic osteotomes and conventional rotatory burs, in order to perform micromorphological and histological analyses of osteotomized bone surfaces. Bony samples were taken from adult bovine ribs including both the cortical and marrow bone. Soft tissues have been removed and the bone pieces were divided into four groups, to test four devices: a conventional osteotomy round bur, a Lindeman bur and piezoelectric osteotomes ES007 and the T-Black. Each device performed cuts that were examined via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and light microscopy (LM) to check respectively cut precision and bone architecture all along the defect borders. SEM analysis of specimens showed that burs created defects of greater width and with irregular edges while those produced by ultrasonic osteotomes were narrow and had mostly smooth cutting surfaces. The edges of incisions made by drills were full of bone fragments while less bone chips were observed on piezoincision\u0092s ones. Dimensions of fragments were wider if cuts were made by burs too. LM analysis of samples showed focally, delicate bony trabecules crushed and pressed into the bone marrow in cutting made by burs. Samples cut by ultrasonic devices showed small or no smear layer and only partial or no crushed trabecules. Osteocytes seemed to be intact all along the cutting surface in all samples observed. In the present study, according to literature, ultrasonic surgery validity is confirmed. As a matter of fact, the greater the number of bone chips products, the greater the magnitude of the inflammatory process induced, as well as the possibility of a greater bone loss and delay in wound healing near the osteotomized area.", "journal": "Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents", "date": "2012-04-01", "authors": ["GPerfetti", "IDe Tullio", "DBerardi", "DDi Iorio", "GSpoto", "AScarano"], "doi": null}

Microstructural analysis reveals the crystalline nature of PZT with small nanocrystals aligned in different directions. First-order Raman modes of MWCNT and PZT/MWCNT/n-Si show the high structural quality of CNT before and after PZT deposition at elevated temperature.

We used a bottom-up approach in which a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment of titanium propoxide aqueous solutions in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and triethanolamine was used to create suspensions containing titania nanoparticles. Different inkjet printing set-ups, electromagnetic and piezoelectric driven, were tested to deposit the inks on glass substrates. The presence of preformed titania nanoparticles was expected to make it possible to reduce the heating temperature necessary to obtain the functionality of photocatalysis which can widen the application range of the approach to heat-sensitive substrates. We investigated the crystallinity and size of the obtained nanoparticles by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The rheological properties of the suspensions were evaluated against the relevant criteria for inkjet printing and the jettability was analyzed. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained layers was analyzed by following the decomposition of a methylene blue solution under UV illumination. The influence of the heat treatment temperature on the film roughness, thickness and photocatalytic activity was studied.

{"title": "Response to a pure tone in a nonlinear mechanical-electrical-acoustical model of the cochlea.", "abstract": "In this article, a nonlinear mathematical model is developed based on the physiology of the cochlea of the guinea pig. The three-dimensional intracochlear fluid dynamics are coupled to a micromechanical model of the organ of Corti and to electrical potentials in the cochlear ducts and outer hair cells (OHC). OHC somatic electromotility is modeled by linearized piezoelectric relations whereas the OHC hair-bundle mechanoelectrical transduction current is modeled as a nonlinear function of the hair-bundle deflection. The steady-state response of the cochlea to a single tone is simulated in the frequency domain using an alternating frequency time scheme. Compressive nonlinearity, harmonic distortion, and DC shift on the basilar membrane (BM), tectorial membrane (TM), and OHC potentials are predicted using a single set of parameters. The predictions of the model are verified by comparing simulations to available in\u00a0vivo experimental data for basal cochlear mechanics. In particular, the model predicts more amplification on the reticular lamina (RL) side of the cochlear partition than on the BM, which replicates recent measurements. Moreover, small harmonic distortion and DC shifts are predicted on the BM, whereas more significant harmonic distortion and DC shifts are predicted in the RL and TM displacements and in the OHC potentials.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2012-03-30", "authors": ["JulienMeaud", "KarlGrosh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2012.02.026"}

Although previously reported copper mandelate prepared by hydrothermal reaction was a centrosymmetric coordination polymer because of the racemization of mandelic acid, the current coordination polymer shows noncentrosymmetry and a completely different structure from that previously reported. The X-ray crystallography for 1-L revealed that the copper center of the compound showed a highly distorted octahedral structure bridged by a chiral mandelate ligand in the unusual coordination mode to construct a one-dimensional (1D) zigzag chain structure. These 1D chains interdigitated each other to give a layered structure as a result of the formation of multiple aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl and carboxylate moieties at mandelate ligands.

{"title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa attachment on QCM-D sensors: the role of cell and surface hydrophobicities.", "abstract": "While biofilms are ubiquitous in nature, the mechanism by which they form is still poorly understood. This study investigated the process by which bacteria deposit and, shortly after, attach irreversibly to surfaces by reorienting to create a stronger interaction, which leads to biofilm formation. A model for attachment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was developed using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technology, along with a fluorescent microscope and camera to monitor kinetics of adherence of the cells over time. In this model, the interaction differs depending on the force that dominates between the viscous, inertial, and elastic loads. P. aeruginosa, grown to the midexponential growth phase (hydrophilic) and stationary phase (hydrophobic) and two different surfaces, silica (SiO(2)) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which are hydrophilic and hydrophobic, respectively, were used to test the model. The bacteria deposited on both of the sensor surfaces, though on the silica surface the cells reached a steady state where there was no net increase in deposition of bacteria, while the quantity of cells depositing on the PVDF surface continued to increase until the end of the experiments. The change in frequency and dissipation per cell were both positive for each overtone (n), except when the cells and surface are both hydrophilic. In the model three factors, specifically, viscous, inertial, and elastic loads, contribute to the change in frequency and dissipation at each overtone when a cell deposits on a sensor. On the basis of the model, hydrophobic cells were shown to form an elastic connection to either surface, with an increase of elasticity at higher overtones. At lower overtones, hydrophilic cells depositing on the hydrophobic surface were shown to also be elastic, but as the overtone increases the connection between the cells and sensor becomes more viscoelastic. In the case of hydrophilic cells interacting with the hydrophilic surface, the connection is viscous at each overtone measured. It could be inferred that the transformation of the viscoelasticity of the cell-surface connection is due to changes in the orientation of the cells to the surface, which allow the bacteria to attach irreversibly and begin biofilm formation.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2012-03-24", "authors": ["Ian MMarcus", "MosheHerzberg", "Sharon LWalker", "ViatcheslavFreger"], "doi": "10.1021/la300333c"}

The experimentally measured resonant frequencies from the PVDF sensor and the strain gauge were compared with those predicted from theoretical and FEM numerical calculations.

Furthermore, quartz actuators in the form of a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate the three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner.

{"title": "Extracorporeal shockwave therapy in musculoskeletal disorders.", "abstract": "The sources of shockwave generation include electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric principles. Electrohydraulic shockwaves are high-energy acoustic waves generated under water explosion with high voltage electrode. Shockwave in urology (lithotripsy) is primarily used to disintegrate urolithiasis, whereas shockwave in orthopedics (orthotripsy) is not used to disintegrate tissues, rather to induce tissue repair and regeneration. The application of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in musculoskeletal disorders has been around for more than a decade and is primarily used in the treatment of sports related over-use tendinopathies such as proximal plantar fasciitis of the heel, lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, calcific or non-calcific tendonitis of the shoulder and patellar tendinopathy etc. The success rate ranged from 65% to 91%, and the complications were low and negligible. ESWT is also utilized in the treatment of non-union of long bone fracture, avascular necrosis of femoral head, chronic diabetic and non-diabetic ulcers and ischemic heart disease. The vast majority of the published papers showed positive and beneficial effects.

The aim of this study was the investigation of intraocular immunoglobulin M (IgM) reactivities to retinal proteome.\nRetina was separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and blotted semidry on PVDF membranes. To identify intraocular IgM antibody responses to retinal tissue, blots were incubated with vitreous samples of ERU-diseased horses (n = 50) and healthy controls (n = 30), followed by an HRP-labeled secondary antibody specific for equine IgM. Noticeable 2D western blot signals were aligned on a 2D gel of retinal proteome, excised, and subsequently identified by tandem mass spectrometry.\nInterestingly, frequent and very miscellaneous IgM response patterns to the retinal proteome in 68% of ERU vitreous samples were detected. Binding of IgM antibodies was localized at 17 different molecular weights. The most frequently detected signal, in 21 of the 50 samples, was located at 49 kDa. Comparing the samples interindividually between one and up to nine different signals in one sample could be observed. All healthy vitreous samples were devoid of IgM antibodies. Analysis of targeted spots with mass spectrometry led to the clear identification of 11 different proteins (corresponding to 16 different spots). One candidate could not be discovered so far.\nThe considerable IgM response to retinal proteins demonstrates an ongoing immune response, which might contribute to the remitting relapsing character of ERU.

In order to provide, e.g., a miniaturized submersible explorer with the capability of collecting microorganisms, a compact sample enrichment system has been developed. The sampler is 30 mm long, 15 mm wide, and just a few millimetres thick. Integrated in a multilayer steel, polyimide and glass construction is a microfluidic channel with piezoelectric transducers, where microorganism and particle samples are collected and enriched, using acoustic radiation forces for gentle and labelless trapping. High-pressure, latchable valves, using paraffin as the actuation material, at each end of the microfluidic channel keep the collected sample pristine. A funnel structure raised above the surface of the device directs water into the microfluidic channel as the vehicle propels itself or when there is a flow across its hull. The valves proved leak proof to a pressure of 2.1 MPa for 19 hours and momentary pressures of 12.5 MPa, corresponding to an ocean depth of more than 1200 metres. By reactivating the latching mechanism, small leakages through the valves could be remedied, which could thus increase the leak-less operational time. Fluorescent particles, 1.9 \u03bcm in diameter, were successfully trapped in the microfluidic channel at flow rates up to 15 \u03bcl min(-1), corresponding to an 18.5 cm s(-1) external flow rate of the sampler.

Holes at the film surface greatly reduce the piezoelectric potential screening effect caused by free electrons in a piezoelectric semiconducting material. Furthermore, additional carriers from a conducting polymer and a shift in the Fermi level help in increasing the power output.

{"title": "Interaction energy evaluation of soluble microbial products (SMP) on different membrane surfaces: role of the reconstructed membrane topology.", "abstract": "Soluble microbial products (SMP), a majority of organic matter in effluents, play a key role in membrane fouling. A series of filtration experiments were conducted, and demonstrated that the flux decrement rate was in order of cellulose acetate membrane (CA, 65.4%), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 47.9%) and polyether sulfones (PES, 29.2%). Results showed that the fouling behavior of membrane should be predicted from the combined knowledge of solution chemistry, surface chemical properties and surface morphology. To better understand the interactions between the SMP and different membranes, a technique for reconstructing the membrane surface topology was developed on the basis of statistical parameters obtained from atomic force microscopy. The interaction energy, represented by extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) potential, was calculated by surface element integration, allowing exploring the interaction energy profiles for different surfaces and providing considerable insights into the role of such interactions on the macroscopic fouling behavior. The resulting interaction energy differed considerably from the corresponding interaction between perfectly smooth surfaces. The great influence of protrusion on the membrane surface was to reduce the primary energy barrier height, thus rendering rough surface more favorable for deposition. An attractive energy region was immediately surrounded by each positive asperity as demonstrated in the roughness-engendered interaction energy maps. As the SMP approached closer to the membrane, they had a high probability of getting trapped in the attractive energy region, leading to a more rapid loss of flux than smooth membrane.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-03-13", "authors": ["LinChen", "YuTian", "Chu-qingCao", "JunZhang", "Zhi-nengLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2012.02.030"}
{"title": "Acoustic field modeling for physiotherapy ultrasound applicators by using approximated functions of measured non-uniform radiation distributions.", "abstract": "The strongest therapeutic effects in ultrasonic physiotherapy are mainly produced at the first centimeters, i.e. close to the applicator surface and, in general, only in the near-field zone. The acoustic field produced in practice by this type of transducers differs from the classical models because the vibration distribution on the real transducer surfaces is non-uniform. However, neither models using uniform distribution, nor those using typical non-uniform distribution patterns for the source accurately represent the radiation of this kind of transducers. Although this therapy is widely used and many efforts have been made in experimentally studying the patterns of ultrasound radiation produced during physiotherapy applications (IEC-61689, 1998), additional modeling researches still would be needed in order to achieve improved models giving field patterns closer to the measured ultrasonic results. In this paper, acoustic patterns produced from two source radiation functions are proposed and evaluated for field modeling of physiotherapy applicators. Both the functions are approximations to the pressure distribution measured close to the emitting surface and they are based on the modulation of the classical simply-supported function using either sinusoidal or Bessel-type distributions. The simply-supported function is accounted for the radiator-fixing condition and the modulation function simulates the complex vibration distribution of this kind of transducer. The modulator Bessel function is based on reports about Bessel-type vibration distributions found in piezoelectric disk resonators. The use of a selected sinusoidal segment represents another analytical option for obtaining an approximated behavior of the measured data in a real applicator. Both the field models are implemented using the finite element method (FEM) to obtain the numerical solution of wave equation at each point in the radiated space. The solution is reached by considering axisymmetric radiation in attenuation-free media. The results indicate the viability of applying an adequate model for acoustic field calculation by simulating the radiating distribution on the emitting surface as either sinusoidal or Bessel-modulated functions. Models using both the functions describe reasonably real behaviors, but those based on Bessel functions are better correlated with the measurements. The results for three commercial applicators indicate the possibility of representing, with adequate verisimilitude, the acoustic field radiated by physiotherapy ultrasound transducers using linear combinations of Bessel profiles describing the radiation source.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-03-13", "authors": ["Mario Ibrah\u00ednGuti\u00e9rrez", "H\u00e9ctorCal\u00e1s", "AntonioRamos", "ArturoVera", "LorenzoLeija"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.02.006"}

An additional peak localized at 1.39 eV has been shown on PL spectra of both GaAs(114)A and (113)A samples. This peak persists even at lower power density. Supporting on the polarized photoluminescence characterization, we have attributed this additional peak to the quantum strings (QSTs) emission. A theoretical study based on the resolution of the three dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation, using the finite element method, including strain and piezoelectric-field effect was adopted to distinguish the observed photoluminescence emission peaks.

Thin polymerfilms of these porphyrins served for recognition and the piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) for analytical signal transduction of a new chemical sensor devised for determination of these alkaloids. The films were deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization on the 10 MHz quartz resonators of the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) without affecting the electronic structure of the porphyrin macrocycles.

{"title": "Non-contact thrust stand calibration method for repetitively pulsed electric thrusters.", "abstract": "A thrust stand calibration technique for use in testing repetitively pulsed electric thrusters for in-space propulsion has been developed and tested using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand. In the implementation of this technique, current pulses are applied to a solenoid to produce a pulsed magnetic field that acts against a permanent magnet mounted to the thrust stand pendulum arm. The force on the magnet is applied in this non-contact manner, with the entire pulsed force transferred to the pendulum arm through a piezoelectric force transducer to provide a time-accurate force measurement. Modeling of the pendulum arm dynamics reveals that after an initial transient in thrust stand motion the quasi-steady average deflection of the thrust stand arm away from the unforced or \"zero\" position can be related to the average applied force through a simple linear Hooke's law relationship. Modeling demonstrates that this technique is universally applicable except when the pulsing period is increased to the point where it approaches the period of natural thrust stand motion. Calibration data were obtained using a modified hanging pendulum thrust stand previously used for steady-state thrust measurements. Data were obtained for varying impulse bit at constant pulse frequency and for varying pulse frequency. The two data sets exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with each other.

Here we present a piezoelectric inkjet printing system as a simple and convenient approach for fabrication of drug-loaded polymer microparticles with well-defined and controlled shapes. The physical properties of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) inks, such as volatility, viscosity and surface tension, were optimized for piezoelectric inkjet printing, and PTX-loaded PLGA microparticles were fabricated with various geometries, such as circles, grids, honeycombs, and rings. The resulting microparticles with 10% (w/w) PTX exhibited a fairly homogeneous shape and size. The microparticle fabrication by piezoelectric inkjet printing was precise, reproducible, and highly favorable for mass production. The microparticles exhibited a biphasic release profile with an initial burst due to diffusion and a subsequent, slow second phase due to degradation of PLGA.

However, the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene and h-BN atomic sheets limits their direct application in electronic devices. By first-principles density functional theory calculations we demonstrate that band gap of zigzag BN nanoribbons can be significantly tuned under uniaxial tensile strain. The unexpected sensitivity of band gap results from reduced orbital hybridization upon elastic strain. Furthermore, sizable dipole moment and piezoelectric effect are found in these ribbons owing to structural asymmetry and hydrogen passivation. This will offer new opportunities to optimize two-dimensional nanoribbons for applications such as electronic, piezoelectric, photovoltaic, and opto-electronic devices.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["JingshanQi", "XiaofengQian", "LiangQi", "JiFeng", "DaningShi", "JuLi"], "doi": "10.1021/nl2035749"}
{"title": "Magnetization dynamics, throughput and energy dissipation in a universal multiferroic nanomagnetic logic gate with fan-in and fan-out.", "abstract": "The switching dynamics of a multiferroic nanomagnetic NAND gate with fan-in/fan-out is simulated by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation while neglecting thermal fluctuation effects. The gate and logic wires are implemented with dipole-coupled two-phase (magnetostrictive/piezoelectric) multiferroic elements that are clocked with electrostatic potentials of ~50 mV applied to the piezoelectric layer generating 10.1 MPa stress in the magnetostrictive layers for switching. We show that a pipeline bit throughput rate of ~0.5 GHz is achievable with proper magnet layout and sinusoidal four-phase clocking. The gate operation is completed in 2 ns with a latency of 4 ns. The total (internal + external) energy dissipated for a single gate operation at this throughput rate is found to be only ~500 kT in the gate and ~1250 kT in the 12-magnet array comprising two input and two output wires for fan-in and fan-out. This makes it respectively three and five orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor-transistor (CMOS)-based and spin-transfer-torque-driven nanomagnet-based NAND gates. Finally, we show that the dissipation in the external clocking circuit can always be reduced asymptotically to zero using increasingly slow adiabatic clocking, such as by designing the RC time constant to be three orders of magnitude smaller than the clocking period. However, the internal dissipation in the device must remain and cannot be eliminated if we want to perform fault-tolerant classical computing.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["MohammadSalehi Fashami", "JayasimhaAtulasimha", "SupriyoBandyopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/23/10/105201"}

Current understanding of the chemical factors permitting the synthesis of ambient-pressure-stable perovskite oxides with Bi(3+) on the A site is limited to information derived from average structures. The local structure of the lead-free ferroelectric perovskite Bi(Ti(3/8)Fe(2/8)Mg(3/8))O(3) is studied by reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of neutron scattering data. The resultant model is consistent with the structure derived from diffraction but reveals key extra structural features due to correlated local displacements that are inaccessible from the average unit cell. The resulting structural picture emphasizes the need to combine symmetry-averaged long-range and local analysis of the structures of compositionally complex, substitutionally disordered functional materials. Local correlation of the off-axis displacements of the A site cation produces monoclinic domains consistent with the existence of displacement directions other than R (<111>(p)) or T (<100>(p)). The Bi displacements are correlated ferroelectrically both in the polar direction and orthogonal to it, providing evidence of the presence of monoclinic domains. The octahedral cation environments reveal distinct differences in the coordination geometry of the different B site metal ions. The local nature of these deviations and correlations makes them inaccessible to long-range averaged techniques.

There are no effective, quick and practicable methods for the diagnosis of rice dwarf disease that can be used in the field. Traditional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methodology is accurate but requires expensive reagents and instruments, as well as complex procedures that limit its applicability for field tests. To develop a sensitive and reliable assay for routine laboratory diagnosis, a rapid dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) method was developed for testing rice plants infected by SRBSDV. Based on anti-SRBSDV rabbit antiserum, this new dot-ELISA was highly reliable, sensitive and specific toward SRBSDV. The accuracy of two blotting media, polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF membrane) and nitrocellulose filter membrane (NC membrane), was compared. In order to facilitate the on-site diagnosis, three county laboratories were established in Shidian (Yunnan province), Jianghua (Hunan Province) and Libo (Guizhou province). Suspected rice cases from Shidian, Yuanjiang and Malipo in Yunnan province were tested and some determined to be positive for SRBSDV by the dot-ELISA and confirmed by the One Step RT-PCR method. To date, hundreds of suspected rice samples collected from 61 districts in southwestern China have been tested, among which 55 districts were found to have rice crops infected by SRBSDV.

We examined whether it pick up sensitively from the intact ossicular chain and postulated whether it be an optimal implantable one.\nAnimal controlled experiment: five adult cats (eight ears) were sacrificed as the model to test the electroacoustic performance of the FPM. Three groups were studied: (1) the experiment group (on malleus): the FPM glued onto the handle of the malleus of the intact ossicular chains; (2) negative control group (in vivo): the FPM only hung into the tympanic cavity; (3) positive control group (Hy-M30): a HiFi commercial microphone placed close to the site of the experiment ear.

{"title": "A system for incubations at high gas partial pressure.", "abstract": "High-pressure is a key feature of deep subsurface environments. High partial pressure of dissolved gasses plays an important role in microbial metabolism, because thermodynamic feasibility of many reactions depends on the concentration of reactants. For gases, this is controlled by their partial pressure, which can exceed 1\u2009MPa at in situ conditions. Therefore, high hydrostatic pressure alone is not sufficient to recreate true deep subsurface in situ conditions, but the partial pressure of dissolved gasses has to be controlled as well. We developed an incubation system that allows for incubations at hydrostatic pressure up to 60\u2009MPa, temperatures up to 120\u00b0C, and at high gas partial pressure. The composition and partial pressure of gasses can be manipulated during the experiment. To keep costs low, the system is mainly made from off-the-shelf components with only very few custom-made parts. A flexible and inert PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) incubator sleeve, which is almost impermeable for gases, holds the sample and separates it from the pressure fluid. The flexibility of the incubator sleeve allows for sub-sampling of the medium without loss of pressure. Experiments can be run in both static and flow-through mode. The incubation system described here is usable for versatile purposes, not only the incubation of microorganisms and determination of growth rates, but also for chemical degradation or extraction experiments under high gas saturation, e.g., fluid-gas-rock-interactions in relation to carbon dioxide sequestration. As an application of the system we extracted organic compounds from sub-bituminous coal using H(2)O as well as a H(2)O-CO(2) mixture at elevated temperature (90\u00b0C) and pressure (5\u2009MPa). Subsamples were taken at different time points during the incubation and analyzed by ion chromatography. Furthermore we demonstrated the applicability of the system for studies of microbial activity, using samples from the Isis mud volcano.

{"title": "The role of Drosophila Piezo in mechanical nociception.", "abstract": "Transduction of mechanical stimuli by receptor cells is essential for senses such as hearing, touch and pain. Ion channels have a role in neuronal mechanotransduction in invertebrates; however, functional conservation of these ion channels in mammalian mechanotransduction is not observed. For example, no mechanoreceptor potential C (NOMPC), a member of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, acts as a mechanotransducer in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; however, it has no orthologues in mammals. Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family members are mechanotransducers in C. elegans and potentially in D. melanogaster; however, a direct role of its mammalian homologues in sensing mechanical force has not been shown. Recently, Piezo1 (also known as Fam38a) and Piezo2 (also known as Fam38b) were identified as components of mechanically activated channels in mammals. The Piezo family are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins. It is unknown whether they function in mechanical sensing in vivo and, if they do, which mechanosensory modalities they mediate. Here we study the physiological role of the single Piezo member in D. melanogaster (Dmpiezo; also known as CG8486). Dmpiezo expression in human cells induces mechanically activated currents, similar to its mammalian counterparts. Behavioural responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were severely reduced in Dmpiezo knockout larvae, whereas responses to another noxious stimulus or touch were not affected. Knocking down Dmpiezo in sensory neurons that mediate nociception and express the DEG/ENaC ion channel pickpocket (ppk) was sufficient to impair responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, expression of Dmpiezo in these same neurons rescued the phenotype of the constitutive Dmpiezo knockout larvae. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings from ppk-positive neurons revealed a Dmpiezo-dependent, mechanically activated current. Finally, we found that Dmpiezo and ppk function in parallel pathways in ppk-positive cells, and that mechanical nociception is abolished in the absence of both channels.

Transcranial focused ultrasound (551.5 kHz, 10-msec bursts, 2-Hz pulse repetition frequency, 2 minute sonication) in conjunction with circulating microbubbles was applied in 86 locations in 27 rats to disrupt the BBB. Acoustic emissions captured during each burst by using a wideband polyvinylidene fluoride hydrophone were analyzed for spectral content and used to adjust treatment pressures. Pressures were increased incrementally after each burst until ultraharmonic emissions were detected, at which point the pressure was reduced to a percentage of the pressure required to induce the ultraharmonics and was maintained for the remainder of the sonication. Disruption was evaluated at contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Mean enhancement was calculated by averaging the signal intensity at the focus over a 3 \u00d7 3-pixel region of interest and comparing it with that in nonsonicated tissue. Histologic analysis was performed to determine the extent of damage to the tissue. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student t tests.\nFor sonications resulting in BBB disruption, the mean peak pressure was 0.28 MPa \u00b1 0.05 (standard deviation) (range, 0.18-0.40 MPa).

At higher scaling levels, histologic analysis revealed gross tissue damage, while at a 50% scaling level, no damage was observed at high-field-strength MR imaging or histologic examination 8 days after treatment.\nThis study demonstrates that acoustic emissions can be used to actively control focused ultrasound exposures for the safe induction of BBB disruption.", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2012-02-15", "authors": ["Meaghan AO'Reilly", "KullervoHynynen"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.11111417"}
{"title": "Progress in piezotronics and piezo-phototronics.", "abstract": "The fundamental principle of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics were introduced by Wang in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry in materials such as the wurtzite structured ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. Owing to the simultaneous possession of piezoelectricity and semiconductor properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport at the interface/junction. Piezotronics is about the devices fabricated using the piezopotential as a \"gate\" voltage to tune/control charge carrier transport at a contact or junction. The piezo-phototronic effect is to use the piezopotential to control the carrier generation, transport, separation and/or recombination for improving the performance of optoelectronic devices, such as photon detector, solar cell and LED.

{"title": "Properties of Ca2+ sparks revealed by four-dimensional confocal imaging of cardiac muscle.", "abstract": "Parameters (amplitude, width, kinetics) of Ca(2+) sparks imaged confocally are affected by errors when the spark source is not in focus. To identify sparks that were in focus, we used fast scanning (LSM 5 LIVE; Carl Zeiss) combined with fast piezoelectric focusing to acquire x-y images in three planes at 1-\u00b5m separation (x-y-z-t mode). In 3,000 x-y scans in each of 34 membrane-permeabilized cat atrial cardiomyocytes, 6,906 sparks were detected. 767 sparks were in focus. They had greater amplitude, but their spatial width and rise time were similar compared with all sparks recorded. Their distribution of amplitudes had a mode at \u0394F/F(0) = 0.7. The Ca(2+) release current underlying in-focus sparks was 11 pA, requiring 20 to 30 open channels, a number at the high end of earlier estimates. Spark frequency was greater than in earlier imaging studies of permeabilized ventricular cells, suggesting a greater susceptibility to excitation, which could have functional relevance for atrial cells. Ca(2+) release flux peaked earlier than the time of peak fluorescence and then decayed, consistent with significant sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) depletion. The evolution of fluorescence and release flux were strikingly similar for in-focus sparks of different rise time (T). Spark termination involves both depletion of Ca(2+) in the SR and channel closure, which may be synchronized by depletion. The observation of similar flux in sparks of different T requires either that channel closure and other termination processes be independent of the determinants of flux (including [Ca(2+)](SR)) or that different channel clusters respond to [Ca(2+)](SR) with different sensitivity.", "journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "date": "2012-02-15", "authors": ["Vyacheslav MShkryl", "Lothar ABlatter", "EduardoR\u00edos"], "doi": "10.1085/jgp.201110709\n10.1085/jgp.112.3.297\n10.1085/jgp.20028620\n10.1073/pnas.94.8.4176\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0469p.x\n10.1073/pnas.0500059102\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00419.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.014\n10.1085/jgp.113.3.373\n10.1085/jgp.200308787\n10.1126/science.8235594\n10.1007/BF00724526\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77229-2\n10.1152/ajpcell.00437.2006\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0301i.x\n10.1038/228034a0\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1978.tb41979.x\n10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.002453\n10.1242/jcs.028175\n10.1016/S0006-3495(98)74034-2\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75997-8\n10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77072-4\n10.1085/jgp.200308843\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00379.x\n10.1038/379455a0\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.391ac.x\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.025502\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75903-6\n10.1073/pnas.97.14.7823\n10.1161/01.RES.0000172556.05576.4c\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0417k.x\n10.1016/S0006-3495(84)84203-4\n10.1126/science.270.5236.633\n10.1016/j.ceca.2007.02.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.240234\n10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79525-5\n10.1007/s00424-009-0658-y\n10.1085/jgp.114.1.31\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76005-5\n10.1085/jgp.200709870\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.01.042\n10.1073/pnas.95.25.15096\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.026963\n10.1016/S0006-3495(04)74095-3\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.003bl.x\n10.1085/jgp.113.3.377\n10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77491-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.024\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75149-7\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75584-7\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2003.12.006\n10.1073/pnas.0703016104\n10.1085/jgp.110.4.415\n10.1085/jgp.113.3.469\n10.1126/science.7569901\n10.1038/35069083\n10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75165-5\n10.1073/pnas.0306157101\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.024190\n10.1085/jgp.200308796\n10.1085/jgp.200509353\n10.1085/jgp.116.6.845\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.040345\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.055848\n10.1529/biophysj.107.114694\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.183236\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.197913"}

Using its excellent reflecting properties, the phononic structures confined the acoustic field within the superstrate, resulting in the concentration of the acoustic energy, in a manner controllable by the excitation frequency. We show that this capability mitigates against coupling losses incurred by the use of a disposable superstrate, greatly reducing the time needed to nebulise a drop of water with respect to an unstructured superstrate for a given power. We also demonstrate that by changing the excitation frequency, it is possible to change the spatial position at which the acoustic energy is concentrated, providing a means to specifically nebulise drops across an array.

Contactless methods like laser interferometry are therefore promising methods. In addition, as long as there is strong electromechanical coupling between the transducer and the device also electrical measurements like admittance curves give insight into the frequencies at which the devices might work best. This is the case for example for piezoelectric transducers working at one of their resonance frequencies. Because the devices usually are used in resonant modes, narrow frequency detection methods like lock in amplifiers help to improve the signal to noise ratio.

The substrate has sub-100 nm positioning resolution in three axes of translation, and its temperature is controlled using thermoelectric modules. The capillary tip can rotate about the vertical axis while simultaneously dispensing liquid onto the substrate. Liquid is displaced using a custom bidirectional diaphragm pump, in which an elastic membrane is hydraulically actuated by a stainless steel syringe. The syringe is driven by a piezoelectric actuator, enabling nanoliter volume and rate control. A quantitative model of the liquid dispenser is verified experimentally, and suggests that compressibility in the hydraulic line deamplifies the syringe stroke, enabling sub-nanoliter resolution control of liquid displacement at the capillary tip. We use this system to contact-print water and oil droplets by mechanical manipulation of a liquid bridge between the capillary and the substrate.

{"title": "Simple electronics for inertial and Pan-type piezoelectric positioners used in scanning probe microscopes.", "abstract": "We describe a new type of circuit designed for driving piezoelectric positioners that rely on the stick-slip phenomenon. The circuit can be used for inertial positioners that have only one piezoelectric element (or multiple elements that are moved simultaneously) or for designs using a sequential movement of independent piezoelectric elements. A relay switches the piezoelectric elements between a high voltage source and ground, thus creating a fast voltage step followed by a slow ramp produced by the exponential discharging of the piezoelectric elements through a series resistor. A timing cascade is generated by having each relay power the next relay in the sequence. This design is simple and inexpensive. While it was developed for scanning probe microscopes, it may be useful for any piezoelectric motor based on a fast jump followed by a slow relaxation.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2012-02-04", "authors": ["LeuJenChen", "Seong HeonKim", "Alfred K HLee", "Alexde Lozanne"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3680082"}
{"title": "High-speed force load in force measurement in liquid using scanning probe microscope.", "abstract": "This article presents an inversion-based iterative feedforward-feedback (II-FF/FB) approach to achieve high-speed force load in force measurement of soft materials in liquid using scanning probe microscope (SPM). SPM force measurement under liquid environment is needed to interrogate a wide range of soft materials, particularly live biological samples. Moreover, when dynamic evolution of the sample occurs during the measurement, and/or measuring the rate-dependent viscoelasticity of the sample, the force measurement also needs to be acquired at high-speed. Precision force load in liquid, however, is challenged by adverse effects including the thermal drift effect, the reduction of the signal to noise ratio, the distributive hydrodynamic force effect, and the hysteresis and vibrational dynamics effects of the piezoelectric actuators (for positioning the probe relative to the sample), particularly during high-speed measurement. Thus, the main contribution of the article is the development of the II-FF/FB approach to tackle these challenges. The proposed method is illustrated through an experimental implementation to the force-curve measurement of a poly (dimethylsiloxane) sample in liquid at high-speed.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2012-02-04", "authors": ["YanZhang", "QingzeZou"], "doi": "10.1063/1.3678320"}

A tilt stage is used to adjust the probe-sample relative angle to compensate the evitable non-parallel effects. Based on the new STM system, sample-tilt-scanning methodology is proposed for eliminating the scanning blind region between the probe and the microstructure. A high step microstructure with height of 23 \u03bcm, 90\u00b0 steep sidewall and width of 50\u03bcm has been successfully measured. The slope angle of the sidewall has been achieved to be 85\u00b0 and the step height at the rising edge and the trench depth at the falling edge are both measured to be 22.96 \u03bcm. The whole measuring process only spent less than 10 min. It provides an effective and nondestructive solution for the measurement of high step or deep trench microstructures.

The most significant studies are reviewed and integrated into a practical approach to the understanding and designation of these lesions. A paradigm shift is suggested regarding use of the term \"biocorrosion\" to supplant \"erosion\" as it continues to be misused in the United States and many other countries of the world. Biocorrosion embraces the chemical, biochemical, and electrochemical degradation of tooth substance caused by endogenous and exogenous acids, proteolytic agents, as well as the piezoelectric effects only on dentin. Abfraction, representing the microstructural loss of tooth substance in areas of stress concentration, should not be used to designate all NCCLs because these lesions are commonly multifactorial in origin. Appropriate designation of a particular NCCL depends upon the interplay of the specific combination of three major mechanisms: stress, friction, and biocorrosion, unique to that individual case. Modifying factors, such as saliva, tongue action, and tooth form, composition, microstructure, mobility, and positional prominence are elucidated.\nBy performing a comprehensive medical and dental history, using precise terms and concepts, and utilizing the Revised Schema of Pathodynamic Mechanisms, the dentist may successfully identify and treat the etiology of root surface lesions.

A compact, robust, quasi-monolithic tilted field-widened Michelson interferometer is being developed as the spectral discrimination filter for an second-generation HSRL(HSRL-2) at NASA Langley Research Center. The Michelson interferometer consists of a cubic beam splitter, a solid arm and an air arm. Piezo stacks connect the air arm mirror to the body of the interferometer and can tune the interferometer within a small range. The whole interferometer is tilted so that the standard Michelson output and the reflected complementary output can both be obtained. In this paper, the transmission ratio is proposed to evaluate the performance of the spectral filter for HSRL. The transmission ratios over different types of system imperfections, such as cumulative wavefront error, locking error, reflectance of the beam splitter and anti-reflection coatings, system tilt, and depolarization angle are analyzed. The requirements of each imperfection for good interferometer performance are obtained.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2012-01-26", "authors": ["DongLiu", "ChrisHostetler", "IanMiller", "AnthonyCook", "JohnathanHair"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.20.001406"}

Sb(2)S(3) nanowires with nominal diameters of 200 and 100 nm showed d(33(eff)) values around 2 pm V(-1), while the piezo coefficient obtained for 50 nm diameter nanowires was relatively low at around 0.8 pm V(-1). A spontaneous polarization (P(s)) of approximately 1.8 \u03bcC cm(-2) was observed in the 200 and 100 nm Sb(2)S(3) nanowires, which is a 100% enhancement when compared to bulk Sb(2)S(3) and is probably due to the defect-free, single-crystalline nature of the nanowires synthesized.

{"title": "New and conventional pore size tests in virus-removing membranes.", "abstract": "Microorganisms are retained by ultrafiltration (UF) membranes mainly due to size exclusion. The sizes of viruses and membrane pores are close to each other and retention of viruses can be guaranteed only if the precise pore diameter is known. Unfortunately and rather surprisingly, there is no direct method to determine the membrane pore size. As a result, the UF membranes are not trusted to remove the viruses, and the treatment plants are required to enhance viral disinfection. Here we propose a new, simple and effective method for UF pore size determination using aquasols of gold and silver nanoparticles. We synthesized highly monodispersed suspensions ranging in diameter from 3 to 50 nm, which were later transferred through polymer and ceramic UF membranes. The retention percentage was plotted against the particle diameter to determine the pore size for which a membrane has a retention capability of 50, 90 and 100%. The d(50), d(90) and d(100) values were compared with data obtained from conventional transmembrane flux, polyethylene glycol, and dextran tests, and with the retention of phi X 174 and MS2 bacteriophages. The absolute pore size, d(100), for the majority of tested UF membranes is within 40-50 nm, and can only be detected with the new tests. The average 1.2 log retention of hydrophilic phi X 174 was predicted accurately by models based on the virus hydrodynamic radii and d(100) pore size. The 2.5 log MS2 retention suggests hydrophobic interactions in addition to simple ball-through-cylinder geometry.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2012-01-24", "authors": ["AvivDuek", "ElizabethArkhangelsky", "RonitKrush", "AsherBrenner", "VitalyGitis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.058"}

UV-vis steady state and time-resolved spectroscopy along with (photo)electrochemical techniques have been performed to characterize the obtained materials. The study shows that the embedded nanocrystals increase the PF-DMB stability against oxidation and, at the same time, extend the light harvesting capability to the visible spectral region, thus resulting in detectable photocurrent signals. The nanocomposites have been dispensed by means of a piezo-actuated inkjet system. Such inks present viscosity and surface tension properties well suited for stable and reliable drop-on-demand printing using an inkjet printer. The fabrication of arrays of single-color pixels made of the nanocomposites and micrometers in size has been performed.

To further elucidate the interaction of collagen and MMP-2 in chronic foreign body reaction and to determine the significance of the MMP-2-specific regulatory element (RE-1) that is known to mediate 80% of the MMP-2 promoter activity, the spatial and temporal transcriptional regulation of the MMP-2 gene was analyzed at the cellular level.\nA PVDF mesh material was surface modified by plasma-induced graft polymerization of acrylic acid (PVDF+PAAc). Three different gentamicin concentrations were bound to the provided active sites of the grafted mesh surfaces (2, 5 and 8 \u03bcg/mg). 75 male transgenic MMP-2/LacZ mice harbouring the LacZ reporter gene under control of MMP-2 regulatory sequence -1241/+423, excluding the RE-1 were randomized to five groups. Bilateral of the abdominal midline one of the five different meshes was implanted subcutaneously in each animal. MMP-2 gene transcription (anti-\u00df-galactosidase staining) and MMP-2 protein expression (anti-MMP-2 staining) were analyzed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry 7, 21 and 90 days after mesh implantation. The collagen type I/III ratio was analyzed by cross polarization microscopy to determine the quality of mesh integration.\nThe perifilamentary \u00df-galactosidase expression as well as the collagen type I/III ratio increased up to the 90th day for all mesh modifications, whereas no significant changes could be observed for MMP-2 protein expression between days 21 and 90. Both the 5 and 8 \u03bcg/mg gentamicin group showed significantly reduced levels of \u00df-galactosidase expression and MMP-2 positive stained cells when compared to the PVDF group on day 7, 21 and 90 respectively (5 \u03bcg/mg: p < 0.05 each; 8 \u03bcg/mg: p < 0.05 each). Though the type I/III collagen ratio increased over time for all mesh modifications significant differences to the PVDF mesh were only detected for the 8 \u03bcg/mg group at all 3 time points (p < 0.05 each).\nOur current data indicate that lack of RE-1 is correlated with increased mesh induced MMP-2-gene expression for coated as well as for non-coated mesh materials. Gentamicin coating reduced MMP-2 transcription and protein expression. For the 8 \u03bcg/mg group this effect is associated with an increased type I/III collagen ratio.

Our model sequences were based on glycine proline and hydroxyproline amino acids. We find that longitudinal mechanical strain induces significant variation of the polarization of the collagen fibril. Such a phenomenon is determined by reorientation of the backbone polar groups, which are free to respond to the mechanical solicitation. This non-negligible effect is facilitated by the peculiar folding structure of the collagen helix, which is characterized by the absence of an extended hydrogen-bond network. The stretching/compression of the helix requires a concomitant winding/unwinding motion of the global structure; therefore, the shear components of the stress tensor are the components that most effectively induce structural modification associated to the piezoelectric response. The present calculations also report a pyroelectric response to thermal activation.

{"title": "Bonding and impedance matching of acoustic transducers using silver epoxy.", "abstract": "Silver epoxy was selected to bond transducer plates on glass substrates. The properties and thickness of the bonding medium affect the electrical input impedance of the transducer. Thus, the thickness of the silver epoxy bonding layer was used as a design parameter to optimize the structure for the transducer input impedance to match the 50 \u03a9 output impedance of most radio frequency (RF) generators. Simulation and experimental results show that nearly perfect matching is achieved without using any matching circuit. At the matching condition, the transducer operates at a frequency band a little bit below the half-wavelength resonant frequency of the piezoelectric plate. In experiments, lead titanate (PT) piezoelectric plates were employed. Both full-size, 11.5 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm, and half-size, 5.75 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm, can be well matched using optimal silver epoxy thickness. The transducer assemblies demonstrate high efficiency. The conversion loss from electrical power to acoustic power in soda-lime glass is 4.3 dB. This loss is low considering the fact that the transducers operate at off-resonance by 12%. With proper choice of silver epoxy thickness, the transducer can be matched at the fundamental, the 3rd and 5th harmonic frequencies. This leads to the possible realization of triple-band transducers. Reliability was assessed with thermal cycling test according to Telcordia GR-468-Core recommendation.

The crystal modifications of PBA can be regulated by T(IC,PVDF). Lower T(IC,PVDF) (e.g., 80 \u00b0C) facilitates the formation of PBA \u03b1 crystals in both the isothermal and nonisothermal melt crystallizations and also favors the \u03b2-to-\u03b1 phase transition of PBA upon annealing at elevated temperatures. This might be attributable to the decreased equilibrium melting temperature of PBA when T(IC,PVDF) is decreased. Higher T(IC,PVDF) is favorable for the fractional crystallization of PBA, which tends to segregate in the interlamellar regions of the PVDF matrix under these conditions. PBA shows faster enzymatic degradation in the blends with a lower T(IC,PVDF) than those with a higher T(IC,PVDF), attributable to the preferential formation of \u03b1 crystals at a lower T(IC,PVDF).

An iterative procedure was developed to handle a boundary condition that takes into account the mandibular asymmetries. The results showed asymmetries in the contact pressure distributions that indicated with precision the patient's malocclusion diagnosis. In vivo measurements of contact pressure using piezoelectric sensors agreed with the computational results. It was shown that the left and right ends of the expansion screw move differently with respect to the patient mandible, even though the expansion screw has an opening mechanism to ensure equal stretching at both ends. The contact pressures between the apparatus and the mucosa vary linearly with applied forces, which can simplify the analysis of the biomechanical behaviour of the expander mandible apparatus.

{"title": "Facilitating high-force single-polysaccharide stretching using covalent attachment of one end of the chain.", "abstract": "Single polysaccharide force spectroscopy has yielded particularly interesting data, the interpretation of which requires the marriage of statistical-mechanical theories of polymer physics to the complexities afforded by possible force-induced conformational transitions of the constituent sugar rings. However, the difficulty of designing handles for the specific attachment of the different ends of polysaccharide chains to substrates, such as piezoelectric scanners, cantilevers or microbeads has meant that the majority of studies to date have been carried out with the polymer physisorbed to the substrates between which it is stretched, or at best chemically attached via bonds formed at uncontrolled locations along the length of the molecule. This means that the lengths of obtained polysaccharide stretches, as well as the forces that can be placed on the molecule without generating detachment, are generally smaller than those obtainable for polymers that offer the ability to be covalently attached to substrates specifically at their ends. As a consequence it is troublesome and tedious to record a statistically significant number of force curves that extend chains to high enough forces to investigate certain conformational transitions, such as the boat-to-inverted chair, exhibited by polysaccharides such as pectin. Herein, single molecule force-extension curves have been measured for the several pectin samples using AFM. The results are compared when either (1) the polymers have been physisorbed between the cantilever and the surface of the piezo-electric scanner, under several different solvent conditions of pH and ionic strength, or (2) the polymer molecule has been chemically attached at one end to the piezo surface using a recently reported coupling procedure. In fact, using such a chemical attachment to tether the end of the polysaccharide, reduced the frequency of successful stretching events obtained in a particular location, confirming the role of surface diffusion in the physisorbed experiments. Nevertheless, when polymer stretches were successfully recorded, the force that could be applied before detachment was significantly increased, indicating that this methodology has great potential for improving the acquisition of data reporting on force-induced conformational transitions of the sugar ring that require the application of significant stresses.", "journal": "Carbohydrate polymers", "date": "2012-01-04", "authors": ["AbdenorFellah", "NaserBelmiloud", "Richard GHaverkamp", "YacineHemar", "DonOtter", "Martin A KWilliams"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.073"}

{"title": "Smooth Vibrotactile Flow Generation Using Two Piezoelectric Actuators.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for generating a smooth directional vibrotactile flow on a thin plate. While actuating two piezoelectric actuators spatially across the plate, temporal sweeping of the input excitation frequency from zero to the first mode of the resonance frequency can smooth the perceived directional vibrotactile flow, as compared to a vibrotactile flow generated by conventional apparent tactile movement and phantom sensation methods. In order to ascertain important factors in the excitation pattern, a user study was conducted for three factors (amplitude (constant versus modulated), frequency (constant versus swept), and ending shape (sharp versus smooth)). The results showed that frequency sweeping in addition to amplitude modulation and smooth ending were the most important factors in smoothing vibrotactile flows. Moreover, an excitation signal with a smooth ending shape was important for generating nonspiky flows at the midpoint. In this study, a vibration isolation design is also proposed in order to substantially decrease the transmission of the actuator vibration to the mockup housing. As such, it is expected that the proposed vibrotactile flow generation method and vibration isolation design may be useful in applications including generating directional information in navigation maps or for identifying callers in mobile devices.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on haptics", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["NoneJeonggoo Kang", "NoneJongsuh Lee", "NoneHeewon Kim", "NoneKwangsu Cho", "NoneSemyung Wang", "NoneJeha Ryu"], "doi": "10.1109/TOH.2012.1"}

With the incorporation of amorphous acrylic copolymer into the gallery of PVDF lamellae, the molecular connection (tie molecule concentration) between the neighboring PVDF crystals decreases gradually. For the blends with more than 80 wt % PVDF, most of the PVDF \u03b1-crystals are transformed into \u03b2-crystals upon deformation, and the molecular chains of the \u03b2-crystals are aligned along the stretching direction because tie molecules transfer the loading effectively. For the blends with less than 30 wt % PVDF, almost all of the PVDF crystals are isolated from each other with very few tie molecules. Mechanical deformation induces the perpendicular crystal molecular chain arrangement with no crystal form transitions. For the blends with 40 wt % to 70 wt % PVDF, the c-axis-oriented \u03b2-phase and the tilt-oriented \u03b1-phase coexist in the uniaxially stretched blends. The shape-memory properties of the blends were also evaluated over the same blend composition range. The maximum shape-memory recovery properties were observed for the blend sample containing 50 wt % PVDF, in which a small amount of tie molecules connect the PVDF crystallites to form a deformable elastic network. This network contributes to the good shape-memory properties of the blend. For the blends with very few tie molecules or high tie molecule concentrations, the deformation induces the slipping of the amorphous molecules or the large fibrillar crystal structure, respectively; thus, these samples exhibit relatively low shape-memory performance.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Nanowires are often considered as one-dimensional nanostructures; however, the electromechanical coupling leads to a third rank tensor that for wurtzite crystals (GaN NWs) possesses three independent coefficients, d(33), d(13), and d(15). Therefore, the full piezoelectric characterization of individual GaN NWs requires application of electric fields in different directions and measurements of associated displacements on the order of several picometers. In this Letter, we present an experimental approach based on scanning probe microscopy to directly quantify the three-dimensional piezoelectric response of individual GaN NWs. Experimental results reveal that GaN NWs exhibit strong piezoelectricity in three dimensions, with up to six times the effect in bulk.

Experiments on a laboratory in-line filtration system showed instant removal of estrone from 200 \u03bcg/l aqueous solutions by 0.45-\u03bcm nylon membranes (ca. 35 L per m(2) membrane). Comparisons with 0.45-\u03bcm PVDF, PTFE and glass microfiber membranes suggested that the significant estrone adsorption in nylon membrane should be predominately driven by a different mechanism rather than common physical adsorption. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study on nylon membranes and a model compound, N-methylacetamide, showed that the significant adsorption originated from the hydrogen bonding between terminal -OH groups on estrone molecules and nucleophile -C=O groups in amide groups of nylon 6,6. The saturated nylon membrane showed very low leachability in ambient water, while it could be effectively regenerated in alkaline or ethanol solutions.

To show long-term mesh-related complications such as shrinkage or adhesions, a precise visualization of meshes and their vicinity in vivo is important. By supplementing mesh fibers with ferro particles, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to delineate the mesh itself. This study aimed to demonstrate and quantify time-dependent mesh shrinkage in vivo by MRI.\nPolyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) meshes with incorporated superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs) were implanted as an abdominal wall replacement in 30 rats. On days 1, 7, 14, or 21, MRI was performed using a gradient echo sequence with repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) of 50/4.6 and a flip angle of 20\u00b0. The length, width, and area of the device were measured on axial, coronal, and sagittal images, and geometric deformations were assessed by surgical explantation.\nIn all cases, the meshes were visualized and their area estimated by measuring the length and width of the mesh. The MRI presented a mean area shrinkage in vivo of 13% on day 7, 23% on day 14, and 23% on day 21. Postmortem measurements differed statistically from MRI, with a mean area shrinkage of 23% on day 7, 28% on day 14, and 30% on day 21. Ex vivo measurements of shrinkage showed in vivo measurements to be overestimated approximately 8%. Delineation of the mesh helped to show folding or adhesions close to the intestine.\nLoading of surgical meshes with SPIOs allows their precise visualization during MRI and guarantees an accurate in vivo assessment of their shrinkage. The authors' observation clearly indicates that shrinkage in vivo is remarkably less than that shown by illustrated explantation measurements. The use of MRI with such meshes could be a reliable technique for checking on proper operation of implanted meshes and showing related complications, obviating the need for exploratory open surgical revision.", "journal": "Surgical endoscopy", "date": "2011-12-20", "authors": ["NicolasKuehnert", "Nils AKraemer", "JensOtto", "Hank C WDonker", "IoanaSlabu", "MartinBaumann", "Christiane KKuhl", "UweKlinge"], "doi": "10.1007/s00464-011-2057-7\n10.1007/s00464-002-8851-5\n10.1186/1471-2482-9-6\n10.1007/s00268-002-6444-z\n10.1007/s00464-005-0554-2\n10.1007/s00464-009-0500-9\n10.1007/s00330-007-0678-y\n10.1259/bjr/63333975\n10.1007/s00464-007-9707-9\n10.1007/s00423-006-0065-1\n10.1007/s00464-005-0092-y\n10.1007/s00464-010-1110-2\n10.1007/s00261-009-9505-z\n10.1097/RLI.0b013e3181e53e38\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2008.03.011\n10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14746-0\n10.1002/jbm.10119\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2006.06.045\n10.1007/s00464-006-9157-9\n10.1007/s00464-005-0706-4\n10.1055/s-2003-39935\n10.1007/s00464-008-9923-y\n10.1002/jbm.b.31106\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08994.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09577.x"}

For each swimmer, the best-time turn was analyzed with five stationary and synchronized underwater cameras. The 3D reconstruction was performed using the Direct Linear Transformation algorithm. An underwater piezoelectric 3D force platform completed the set-up to compute dynamic variables. Data were smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay filtering method. Three variables were considered relevant in the best Lasso model (3mRTT=2.58-0.425 RD+0.204 VPe+0.0046 TD): the head-wall distance where rotation starts (RD), the horizontal speed at the force peak (VPe), and the 3D length of the path covered during the turn (TD). Furthermore, bivariate analysis showed that upper body (CUBei) and lower limb extension indexes at first contact (CLLei) were also linked to the turn time (r=-0.65 and p<0.05 for both variables). Thus the best turn times were associated with a long RD, slower VPe and reduced TD.

Availability of a clinically reliable and easy-to-use technique to monitor the blood flow before, during, and after a therapeutic intervention may allow early detection and more effective management of this complication. An experimental investigation was performed to evaluate 4 different sensors/techniques for their ability to detect an acute disruption of blood flow to the immature femoral head.\nUnder general anesthesia, the femoral heads of 10 immature pigs were exposed and total head ischemia was induced by ligating the femoral neck and transecting the ligamentum teres. Blood flow was assessed before and after the induction of ischemia using 1 of 4 techniques. The following sensors/techniques were evaluated: fiber optic pressure (FOP), piezoelectric pressure, partial pressure of oxygen, and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The time taken to observe a 50% reduction of the preischemia level was determined and the sensor outputs were monitored until each reached a steady level.\nAll techniques demonstrated a reduction in their respective measurements after a disruption of blood flow to the femoral head. However, the response time differed, even between the 2 pressure sensors (FOP and piezoelectric pressure at 3 and 15 min, respectively). The fastest response time for a 50% reduction was observed with the LDF (2 min) and the FOP (3 min) sensors. The partial pressure of oxygen was the slowest to change, taking over 30 minutes. Technique-dependent advantages and disadvantages were seen. The FOP sensor was fragile and susceptible to the positioning of the sensor tip. The LDF sensor was susceptible to motion artifact.\nThe LDF and the FOP sensors demonstrated a rapid decline in their respective measurements after the induction of ischemia.\nThese techniques may prove to be useful in the assessment of an acute disruption of the femoral head blood flow.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric orthopedics", "date": "2011-12-17", "authors": ["Karen DivitaStandefer", "William APierce", "Daniel JSucato", "Harry K WKim"], "doi": "10.1097/BPO.0b013e31823b1a90"}

The isothermal crystallization behavior of ferrite/PVDF nanocomposites is studied using polarized optical microscopy, and the crystallization kinetic is analyzed by the Avrami theory in order to understand the crystallization conditions leading to the nucleation of the electroactive polymer phase. It is found that the nucleation kinetics is enhanced by the presence of ferrite nanoparticles, as evidenced by the increasing number of spherulites with increasing nanoparticle content and by the variations of the Avrami exponent. The crystallization velocity is intimately related to the polymer \u03b1- or \u03b2-phase formation in the nanocomposites and follows the order NiFe(2)O(4)/PVDF > CoFe(2)O(4)/PVDF > Ni(0.5)Zn(0.5)Fe(2)O(4)/PVDF for a given temperature and nanoparticle loading, which results in larger amounts of \u03b2-phase for CoFe(2)O(4)/PVDF and Ni(0.5)Zn(0.5)Fe(2)O(4)/PVDF nanocomposites.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The measured response suggests that the piezoelectric and semiconducting properties of ZnO effectively enhance the motional current for electromechanical transduction. For a doubly clamped ZnO nanowire resonator with radius ~10 nm and length ~1.91 \u00b5m, a resonant frequency around 21.4 MHz is observed with a quality factor (Q) of ~358 in vacuum. A comparison with the Q obtained in air (~242) shows that these nano-scale devices may be operated in fluid as viscous damping is less significant at these length scales. Additionally, the suspended nanowire bridges show field effect transistor (FET) characteristics when the underlying silicon substrate is used as a gate electrode or using a lithographically patterned in-plane gate electrode.

{"title": "Contribution of complex stapes motion to cochlea activation.", "abstract": "Classic theories of hearing have considered only a translational component (piston-like component) of the stapes motion as being the effective stimulus for cochlear activation and thus the sensation of hearing. Our previous study (Huber et al., 2008) qualitatively showed that rotational components around the long and short axes of the footplate (rocking-like components) lead to cochlear activation as well. In this study, the contribution of the piston-like and rocking-like components of the stapes motion to cochlea activation was quantitatively investigated with measurements in live guinea pigs and a related mathematical description. The isolated stapes in anesthetized guinea pigs was stimulated by a three-axis piezoelectric actuator, and 3-D motions of the stapes and compound action potential (CAP) of the cochlea were measured simultaneously. The measured values were used to fit a hypothesis of the CAP as a linear combination of the logarithms of the piston-like and rocking-like components. Both the piston-like and rocking-like components activate cochlear responses when they exceed certain thresholds. These thresholds as well as the relation between CAP and intensity of the motion component were different for piston-like and rocking-like components. The threshold was found to be higher and the sensitivity lower for the rocking-like component than the corresponding values for the piston-like component. The influence of the rocking-like component was secondary in cases of piston-dominant motions of the stapes although it may become significant for low amplitudes of the piston-like component.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["AlbrechtEiber", "Alexander MHuber", "MichaelLauxmann", "MichailChatzimichalis", "DamienSequeira", "Jae HoonSim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2011.11.008"}

For the ternary nickel plating processes, the effects of 3d transition metals including Fe(II), Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) on Ni(II) adsorption were evaluated. The influences of the aforementioned coexistent cations and organic acids were elucidated by the continuum solvation model (COSMO)-corrected density functional theory (DFT) method. Geometries and complexation energies were analyzed for metal-MA-DTPA and Ni(II)-organic acid complexes. DFT results accord with the experimental data, indicating that DFT is helpful to evaluate the complexation between the membrane and metal cations. The coexistent Ca(II) tends to form more stable complex with MA-DTPA ligand than NH(4)(+) and Fe(III), and can interfere with the formation of Ni(II)-MA-DTPA complex. The complexing sequence of 3d metals with MA-DTPA ligand is Zn(II)<Co(II)<Ni(II)<Fe(II)<Cu(II). Therefore, both Fe(II) and Cu(II) have the considerable competition with Ni(II).

Two types of PEGylated copolymers were self-assembly coated onto the surface of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes for enhancing biofouling resistance. It was found that the adsorption capacities of random copolymers on PVDF membranes were all higher than those of block copolymers. However, the specific and overall protein resistance of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on PVDF membranes coated with block copolymers was much higher than that with random copolymers. The increase in styrene content in copolymer increased the amount of polymer coating on the membrane, and the increase in PEGMA content enhanced the protein resistance of membranes. The optimum PS/PEGMA ratio was found to be close to 2 for the best resistance of protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion on the PEGylated diblock copolymer-coated membranes.

However, the current detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) cannot meet the recommended requirements for clinical diagnosis in turnaround time. In this paper, the feature of phage D29 that infects M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) was combined with the sensitivity of multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor (MSPQC) to detect M. tuberculosis. The phage D29 played a role of inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. M. tuberculosis is used to protect phage D29 from being killed by ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) and carries phage D29 into the detection medium containing M. smegmatis. The action of M. smegmatis indicated the existence state of phage D29 in the detection medium. The growth curve of M. smegmatis obtained by MSPQC indicated the state of the growth of M. tuberculosis. Therefore, M. tuberculosis in the sample could be rapidly detected by evaluating the extent of inhibiting the growth of M. smegmatis compared with the normal growth of M. smegmatis. The detection of M. tuberculosis was transformed into the detection of M. smegmatis, which is more rapid and sensitive than that of M. tuberculosis. For 10(2) cfu/mL of M. tuberculosis in clinical sample, the turnaround time was less than 30 h.

{"title": "Forced unbinding of individual urea-aminotriazine supramolecular polymers by atomic force microscopy: a closer look at the potential energy landscape and binding lengths at fixed loading rates.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS) was used to study the forced unbinding of quadruple self-complementary hydrogen-bonded urea-aminotriazine (UAT) complexes in hexadecane (HD). To elucidate the bond strength of individual linkages the unbinding forces of UAT supramolecular polymers were investigated for the first time. The bond rupture was probed at three different, fixed piezo retraction rates in far from equilibrium conditions. The number of supramolecular bonds (N) between AFM tip and the surface was determined by independent knowledge of the linker length. The observed rupture force of urea-aminotriazine (UAT)-based supramolecular polymer chains was found to decrease with increasing rupture length. The dependence of the most probable rupture force on N was in quantitative agreement with the theory of uncooperative bond rupture for supramolecular linkages switched in series. Experiments with three different, fixed loading rates provided identical values (within the experimental error) for the characteristic bond length x(\u03b2) and the off-rate constant in the absence of force k(off)(f = 0). The value of x(\u03b2) was found to agree with literature data on the hydrogen-bond distance obtained via crystallographic data of the hydrogen-bonded dimer. This work broadens the scope of our previous report showing that relevant parameters of the bond energy landscape can be derived from a single data set of rupture events at a fixed loading rate for supramolecular linkages switched in series.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

These methods were applied to the design of a diagnostic chair for unconstrained heart rate and blood pressure monitoring purposes. Our methods were operationalized through capacitively coupled electrodes installed in the chair back that include high-input impedance amplifiers, and conductive textiles installed in the seat for capacitive driven-right-leg circuit configuration that is capable of recording electrocardiogram information through clothing. Photoplethysmograms were measured through clothing using seat mounted sensors with specially designed amplifier circuits that vary in light intensity according to clothing type. Ballistocardiograms were recorded using a film type transducer material, polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF), which was installed beneath the seat cover. By simultaneously measuring signals, beat-to-beat heart rates could be monitored even when electrocardiograms were not recorded due to movement artifacts. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was also monitored using unconstrained measurements of pulse arrival time and other physiological parameters, and our experimental results indicated that the estimated blood pressure tended to coincide with actual blood pressure measurements.

This study is a revisit to the stiffened Love wave propagation done previously. Closed-form dispersion equations are obtained in a very simple mathematical form for both electrically open and shorted cases. From the viewpoint of physical situation, two transverse surface waves (i.e., the stiffened Love wave and the FDLW-type wave) are separately found in a PZT-4/steel system and a PZT-4/zinc system. All the observed dispersion curves are theoretically validated through the discussion on the limit values of phase velocity using the obtained dispersion equations. Those validation and discussion give rise to a deeper understanding on the existence of transverse surface waves in such piezoelectric coupled structures.

In this work, we refine acoustic streaming system for DNA hybridization by inserting an additional piezoelectric transducer and redesigning the locations of the transducers. The Comsol\u00ae Multiphysics was used to design and simulate the velocity field generated by the piezoelectric agitation. The simulated velocity vector followed a spiral vortex flow field with an average direction outward from the center of the transducers. These vortices caused the lower signal intensity in the middle of the microarray for the two-piezoelectric disk design. On the contrary, the problem almost disappeared in the three-piezoelectric-disk system. The optimum condition for controlling the piezoelectric was obtained from the dye experiments with different activation settings for the transducers. The best setting was to activate the side disks and middle disk alternatively with 1 second activating time and 3 second non-activating time for both sets of transducers.

The efficiencies of lipases immobilized on these membranes with different hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties were compared. The lipase immobilized on hydrophobic PVDF-DA-GA membrane exhibited more than an 11-fold increase in activity compared to its immobilization on a hydrophilic RC-DA-GA membrane. The relationship between surface hydrophobicity and immobilized efficiencies was investigated using hydrophobic/hydrophilic GF membranes which were prepared by grafting a different ratio of n-butylamine/1,4-diaminobutane (BA/DA). The immobilized lipase activity on the GF membrane increased with the increased BA/DA ratio. This means that lipase activity was exhibited more on the hydrophobic surface. Moreover, the modified PVDF-DA membrane was grafted with GA, epichlorohydrin (EPI) and cyanuric chloride (CC), respectively. The lipase immobilized on the PVDF-DA-EPI membrane displayed the highest specific activity compared to other membranes.

Vibrating frequencies, displacements, and peak accelerations were tested through a piezoelectric accelerometer under different conditions of load and subjects' position. Eighteen national-level female athletes were assigned to 1 of 3 different groups performing WBV, conventional ST, or a combination of the 2 (WBV + ST). Isometric maximal voluntary contraction, dynamic maximal concentric force, and vertical jump tests were performed before and after the conditioning program. Vibrating displacements and maximum accelerations measured on the device were not always consistent with their expected values calculated from the display and manufacturers' information (sinusoidal waveforms). The WBV alone or in combination with low-intensity resistance exercise did not seem to induce significant enhancements in force and power when compared with ST. It appears that WBV cannot substitute parts of ST loading in a cohort of young female athletes.

It was found that BCECs were inhibited to attach onto the PVA surface. Conversely, relatively more hydrophobic biomaterials EVAL, TCPS, and PVDF successfully initiate BCEC adhesion. Compared to EVAL, cultured BCECs on TCPS and PVDF exhibited higher viability. Furthermore, fibroblastic transformation on EVAL and TCPS was observed at day 17, but BCECs maintained typical hexagonal shape on the PVDF surface at day 21. This phenomenon can be rescued by previously coating type IV collagen on TCPS but not on EVAL. In addition, when BCECs were cultured on PVDF, the expressions of gap junction connexin-43, differentiation marker N-cadherin, and tight junction ZO-1 were well-developed, resembling the physiological phenotypes. After examining the type IV collagen expression by Western blot analysis and protein absorption test, a possible explanation for the better proliferation and preservation of BCECs on the PVDF substrate is that PVDF is a bioactive substratum which enables BCECs to synthesize and reserve more extracellular matrix type IV collagen, paving an important way to provide a more preferential environment for BCEC cultures.

This system drastically increases the number of ion channels that can be studied, as multiple ion channel experiments can now be conducted in parallel. However, due to tedious, usually pressure-driven mechanotransduction techniques, there has been a slow integration of this technology into the field of mechanosensitive ion channels. By implementing a piezoelectric quartz substrate into a planar patch clamp system, we show that the patch clamp substrate itself can be used to mechanically actuate ion channels. The piezoelectric substrate transduces an external, applied electric field into a mechanical tension, so precise actuation of the membrane can be accomplished. By applying this electric field only to the outer edges of the substrate, no ulterior electric field is created in the vicinity of the membrane during actuation. Further, with resonant frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 200 MHz, quartz substrates can be used to apply a wide range of time-varying tensions to cell membranes.

The method involves establishing a reliable silanization method to create an effective non-adhesive PEG layer on glass that inhibits cell attachment, followed by the spotting of collagen or PLL solutions using non-contact piezoelectric printing. We show for the first time that the spotted protein micropatterns remain stable on the PEG surface even after extensive washing, thus significantly simplifying protein pattern formation. We found that adherence and spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts was confined to PLL and collagen areas of the micropatterns. In contrast, primary rat hepatocytes adhered and spread only on collagen micropatterns, where they formed uniform, well defined functionally active cell arrays. The differing affinity of hepatocytes and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts for collagen and PLL patterns was used to develop a simple technique for creating a co-culture of the two cell types. This has the potential to form structured arrays that mimic the in vivo hepatic environment and is easily integrated within a miniaturized analytical platform for developing high throughput toxicity analysis in vitro.", "journal": "Colloids and surfaces.

The neurophysiological basis for the effects of MDMA on somatosensation are unknown. However, MDMA interactions with the serotonin transporter (SERT) and subsequent enhancement of serotonin neurotransmission are well known. The rat trigeminal somatosensory system receives serotonergic afferents from the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because these fibers express SERT, they should be vulnerable to MDMA-induced effects. We found that administration of a challenge injection of MDMA (3 mg/kg i.p.) after repeated MDMA treatment (3 mg/kg per day for 4 days) elicits both serotonin and norepinephrine efflux in the ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamus of Long-Evans hooded rats, the main relay along the lemniscal portion of the rodent trigeminal somatosensory pathway. We evaluated the potential for repeated MDMA administration to modulate whisker-evoked discharge of individual neurons in this region. After surgically implanting stainless steel eight-wire multichannel electrode bundles, we recorded spike train activity of single cells while activating the whisker pathway using a piezoelectric mechanical stimulator. We found that repeated MDMA administration increased the spontaneous firing rate but reduced both the magnitude and duration of whisker-evoked discharge in individual VPM thalamic neurons. The time course of drug action on neuronal firing patterns was generally consistent with fluctuations in neurotransmitter efflux as shown from our microdialysis studies. On the basis of these results, we propose that single use and repeated administration of MDMA may \"distort,\" rather than enhance, tactile experiences in humans, in part, by disrupting normal spike firing patterns through somatosensory thalamic relay circuits.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2011-10-11", "authors": ["M AStarr", "M EPage", "B DWaterhouse"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.111.185728"}

This piezoelectric biofunctionalized transducer was used as a mass-sensitive analytical tool, allowing the real-time binding analysis of jacalin-human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA(1)) and jacalin-bovine IgG(1) interactions from which the apparent affinity constant was calculated. The strategy was centered in immobilizing jacalin on the gold electrode's surface of the piezoelectric crystal resonator using appropriate procedures based on self-assembling of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and 2-mercaptoethanol thiol's mixture, a particular immobilization strategy by which it was possible to avoid cross-interaction between the proteins over electrode's surface. The apparent affinity constants obtained between jacalin-human IgA(1) and jacalin-bovine IgG(1) differed by 1 order of magnitude [(8.0 \u00b1 0.9) 10(5) vs (8.3 \u00b1 0.1) 10(6) L mol(-1)]. On the other hand, the difference found between human IgA(1) and human IgA(2) interaction with jacalin, eight times higher for IgA(1), was attributed to the presence of O-linked glycans in the IgA(1) hinge region, which is absent in IgA(2). Specific interaction of jacalin with O-glycans, proved to be present in the human IgA(1) and hypothetically present in bovine IgG(1) structures, is discussed as responsible for the obtained affinity values.", "journal": "Glycobiology", "date": "2011-10-04", "authors": ["Mariele MPedroso", "Naira CPesquero", "Sandra M OThomaz", "Maria CRoque-Barreira", "Ronaldo CFaria", "Paulo RBueno"], "doi": "10.1093/glycob/cwr099"}

{"title": "Determination of acoustic impedances of multi matching layers for narrowband ultrasonic airborne transducers at frequencies <2.5 MHz - Application of a genetic algorithm.", "abstract": "The effective ultrasonic energy radiation into the air of piezoelectric transducers requires using multilayer matching systems with accurately selected acoustic impedances and the thickness of particular layers. One major problem of ultrasonic transducers, radiating acoustic energy into air, is to find the proper acoustic impedances of one or more matching layers. This work aims at developing an original solution to the acoustic impedance mismatch between transducer and air. If the acoustic impedance defences between transducer and air be more, then finding best matching layer(s) is harder. Therefore we consider PZT (lead zirconate titanate piezo electric) transducer and air that has huge acoustic impedance deference. The vibration source energy (PZT), which is used to generate the incident wave, consumes a part of the mechanical energy and converts it to an electrical one in theoretical calculation. After calculating matching layers, we consider the energy source as layer to design a transducer. However, this part of the mechanical energy will be neglected during the mathematical work. This approximation is correct only if the transducer is open-circuit. Since the possibilities of choosing material with required acoustic impedance are limited (the counted values cannot always be realized and applied in practice) it is necessary to correct the differences between theoretical values and the possibilities of practical application of given acoustic impedances. Such a correction can be done by manipulating other parameters of matching layers (e.g. by changing their thickness). The efficiency of the energy transmission from the piezoceramic transducer through different layers with different thickness and different attenuation enabling a compensation of non-ideal real values by changing their thickness was computer analyzed (base on genetic algorithm). Firstly, three theoretical solutions were investigated. Namely, Chebyshev, Desilets and Souquet theories. However, the obtained acoustic impedances do not necessarily correspond to a nowadays available material. Consequently, the values of the acoustic impedances are switched to the nearest values in a large material database. The switched values of the acoustic impedances do not generally give efficient transmission coefficients. Therefore, we proposed, in a second step, the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the best acoustic impedances for matching layers from the material database for a narrow band ultrasonic transducer that work at frequency below the 2.5MHz by considering attenuation. However this bank is rich, the results get better. So the accuracy of the propose method increase by using a lot of materials with exact data for acoustic impedance and their attenuation, especially in high frequency. This yields highly more efficient transmission coefficient. In fact by using increasing number of layer we can increase our chance to find the best sets of materials with valuable both in acoustic impedance and low attenuation. Precisely, the transmission coefficient is almost equal to unity for the all studied cases. Finally the effect of thickness on transmission coefficient is investigated for different layers. The results showed that the transmission coefficient for air media is a function of thickness and sensitive to it even for small variation in thickness. In fact, the sensitivity increases when the differences of acoustic impedances to be high (difference between PZT and air).", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2011-09-07", "authors": ["SaberSaffar", "AmirAbdullah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.001"}
